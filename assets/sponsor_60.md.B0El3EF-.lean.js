She attended Harvard Law School, helped form the Midnight Special Law Collective and Just Cause Law Collective.  Early years  As a child in Detroit, Michigan, Komisaruk was inspired by reading about the White Rose group who resisted Nazism in Germany. \\"It was important to me to know that not everybody was wrong, that there were some people who did the right thing even when everybody else was failing to stop the train\\", she says about this early influence. Komisaruk attended Reed College and began an MBA program at the University of California, Berkeley. On June 2, 1987 Komisaruk broke into the Vandenberg Air Force Base and destroyed a mainframe computer that she believed to be part of a U.S. first-strike nuclear launch system, NAVSTAR. From an Los Angeles Times article that year: > She broke into the building and for two hours trashed a million-dollar > mainframe IBM 3031 computer, hacking away at it with crowbar, bolt cutters, > hammer and cordless drill. She danced on the computer chips she had pried > loose, spray-painted the casing walls with slogans such as \\"International > Law,\\" \\"Nuremberg\\" and \\"Defense of Necessity,\\" and climbed to the roof to > take similar action against a satellite dish. > She left behind a bouquet of flowers, a box of Mrs. Fields cookies, and a > poem: \\"I have no gun / You must have lots. / Let's not be hasty / No cheap > shots. Please have a cookie and a nice day.\\" Komisaruk walked off the base, > hitched a ride to the Bay Area, got some legal advice and gave herself up > after holding a news conference at the Federal Building in San Francisco. In her defense, she attempted to cite the Nuremberg Principle against starting wars of aggression, although the court was not allowed to hear that argument. In fact, the judge forbade her or her attorney from using any of the terms \\"nuclear missile\\", \\"first strike\\", \\"Nuremberg principles\\", or \\"international law\\". An extensive interview with her about the incident was published in 1988.Med-o, \\"A White Rose Is A White Rose Is A White Rose...\\", Processed World 21, at 18-23 (1988). Processed World is an anarchist magazine published by the Bay Area Center for Art & Technology. While serving a 5-year sentence, Komisaruk studied for the Law School Admission Test (LSAT) and in 1990 gained acceptance to Harvard Law School the same week she was paroled.  Career  Komisaruk helped represent 600 defendants arrested in the 1999 Seattle WTO protests, mostly accused of \\"failure to disperse\\". As a volunteer for Direct Action Network, she suggested a solidarity tactic in which the alleged protestors clog the courts by insisting on a jury trial, unless the City Attorney Mark Sidran agree to a blanket deal in which all defendants are given the same treatment. 92% of the cases were dropped, and the prosecution only brought six cases to trial. Five of the tried defendants were acquitted, and the one conviction resulted in community service and a small fine. In the follow-on 2000 Washington, D.C. protests against the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Komisaruk used a similar approach to get approximately 1,300 activists released with a $5 fine. In Los Angeles, activists were arrested over three days during the 2000 Democratic National Convention protests. Komisaruk documents that 50 people used solidarity tactics, refused to give their names, and went on a hunger strike until a universal plea bargain was worked out. The activists were released with suspended sentences in consideration of time served, and the prosecutor went on to publicly commend the protestors' integrity and commitment. Leaving the Midnight Special Law Collective in 2000, Komisaruk formed Just Cause Law Collective, specializing in activist support and defense. The organization later became \\"Causa Justa :: Just Cause\\", which has changed laws in favor of renters, and fights evictions in Oakland, California. Komisaruk's defense of a client accused of prostitution, who was caught in an undercover sting operation in Oakland, California in 2003, helped catalyze Robyn Few's bid to legalize prostitution in California. Few went on to form Sex Workers Outreach Project USA, and the Just Cause Law Collective's \\"Know Your Rights\\" materials are used to educate sex workers about their legal rights.

His current club is French Rugby Pro D2 side, Nevers. Career =Early career= Wini was born in Lutu, Naitasiri and just like every Fijian, he took up rugby at a very young age. He dreamed of playing for the Fiji 7's team and it came to fruition when the then Fiji 7's coach Ben Ryan spotted him playing in the Martintar and Marist 7's and selected him for the Fiji 7's team for the 2015 Hong Kong Sevens. He played in 5 tournaments for Fiji scoring 14 tries but in July 2015, French Top 14 side, Stade Français signed him up for the 2015–16 Top 14 season. =Stade Français= He made his debut on October 31 against Agen off the bench. He also made the side for the 2015–16 European Rugby Champions Cup pool stage. He scored two tries against Benetton Treviso. but in a game against Munster two weeks later, he was red carded for eye-gouging Munster captain CJ Stander and even though Stade won the game, Raisuqe was charged for Eye-gouging and suspended for 15 weeks. He returned to rugby the following season and then went on to make the Stade side for the 2016–17 European Rugby Challenge Cup pool stage as Stade were demoted after failing to make the cut for the 2016–17 European Rugby Champions Cup after being unable to finish in the Top 8 in the 2015–16 Top 14 season. He helped Stade make the Cup Quarter final but in their Quarter final match against Ospreys, he received a yellow carded for foul play which was followed by another yellow card (and a red) after cynically entering a ruck from the side but videos for the game showed he stamped on Osprey winger, Keelan Giles for which he was cited and later given a 10-week suspension. = Controversy= On July 22, 2017, he decided to celebrate his birthday drinking at a club along with teammate, Waisea Nayacalevu. They both left the club intoxicated and on the way they met a woman, Raisuqe grabbed the woman and physically molested her by fondling her breasts. Her friends tried to help but both Raisuqe and Nayacalevu punched them. Raisuqe and Nayacalevu were picked up by police at around 3am and spent the whole day in jail. They were taken to court two days later and a trial date was set for 29 November. On 18 August, Stade Francais fired Raisuqe for \\"gross misconduct\\" and gave Nayacalevu a formal warning. =Return to rugby= In September 2017, he was picked up by Pro D2 side, Nevers for the 2017–18 Rugby Pro D2 season.

Written and sung by guitarist/vocalist Jerry Cantrell, it features Elton John on piano. The song is a tribute to the band's late lead singer, Layne Staley, who died in 2002. The first concert that Staley attended was Elton John's, and Cantrell's first album was Elton John Greatest Hits (1974). A piano mix of the song is a bonus track on iTunes. The lyrics to \\"Black Gives Way to Blue\\" are printed on the base plate of Jerry Cantrell's signature Cry Baby Wah-Wah pedal. Origin and recording \\"Black Gives Way to Blue\\" was written by Alice in Chains' guitarist and vocalist Jerry Cantrell, and it was one of the first songs he wrote for the band's album of the same name – their first album since 1995's self-titled record. It was also the last track the band recorded for the album. The song, which features the lyrics \\"Imitations are pale\\" and \\"Lay down/I'll remember you\\", is a tribute to the band's late lead singer, Layne Staley. Months before writing the song, Cantrell had been suffering from an unexplained illness. He told Guitar World, \\"I got deathly ill. I had these mystery migraines, intense physical pain, and I'd even gotten a spinal tap to test for certain things. They never could find anything wrong with me. I felt I was puking up all this undigested grief in losing Layne.\\" Once Cantrell started writing the song and the rest of the album, his mystery illness disappeared. Cantrell told Noisecreep that the night the track was recorded, the band was \\"crying their eyes out\\". But he thought writing the song was going to kill him. \\"I sent it to Sean Kinney, and then immediately I started getting these f—ing migraine headaches where I felt like my brain was like unseated in my skull. I went through this mystery illness for about three weeks immediately following that where I really thought I was gonna f—ing die. I was in physical pain to the point of tears, and they couldn't find anything wrong with me.\\" Looking back on it, Cantrell said that he believes it was the pain of saying goodbye to Staley. \\"I think what it really came down to there was a huge chunk of grief there I'd been holding onto for a long time. I think we all have.\\" Cantrell said, \\"I'm really, really proud of that song. I'm proud of it for a lot of reasons. It's all about facing up, owning your s–t, owning your good stuff and your bad stuff, and continuing to walk forward and live a life.\\" In 2009, Cantrell invited Elton John to collaborate with Alice in Chains playing the piano in \\"Black Gives Way to Blue\\", the title track and closing song on the album. Cantrell described the song as the band's goodbye to Staley. The first concert that Staley attended was Elton John's, and his mother revealed that he was blown away by it. And Cantrell's first album was Elton John Greatest Hits (1974), a gift that he received from his father when he was 10 years old. The collaboration was born when Cantrell thought the track could use a little piano, so a friend of his, Baldy, who had worked with Elton John before, suggested the band should call him. John was recording down the hall in the studio the band was working in, so Cantrell sent him a note and a tape explaining that this was the title track and \\"a song from the heart for Layne\\", and asked, \\"Would you consider playing some keyboards on it, whatever the hell you want?\\" A week later, Cantrell was out to lunch during a studio break and his cell phone rang. The studio manager called him and said that Elton John wanted to talk \\"right now\\". Cantrell left his burger sitting on the plate and rushed back. John said he was moved by the track, was a fan of Alice's and Layne's and would be glad to play on it. A few weeks later, the band flew to Las Vegas and Cantrell watched John add piano to the song, the band's first signature piano track. John also sings backing vocals on the track, which he recorded in a Las Vegas studio on April 23, 2009 while he was finishing his Red Piano residency. Cantrell said of the collaboration: Elton John stated that he's been a big admirer of Cantrell for quite some time and couldn't resist the offer to play on the track. He told Entertainment Weekly: In 2016, Cantrell told Metal Hammer that it's still difficult for him to listen to the song. Reception Christian Hoard of Rolling Stone stated that the song \\"is pretty in a calm-after-the-storm way.\\" Matt Melis of Consequence of Sound called it \\"a beautiful and plaintive tribute to Staley.\\" Mike Ragogna of The Huffington Post said of the track: \\"That touching title track is a killer—actually, a heartbreaker—and it says more about the band's healing process than any shrink's assessment would.\\" Live performances The song was performed live for the first time during an exclusive listening party for fans and members of the press, at the Ricardo Montalban Theatre in Los Angeles on July 14, 2009. A photo of Layne Staley was displayed on a screen at the end of the performance when the band played the song during their 2009 tour. For the encore of Alice in Chains' concert at the Moore Theatre in Seattle on September 24, 2009, Jerry Cantrell sat on a stool and played an acoustic version of the song with an empty stool and microphone positioned next to him while the band was offstage. Alice in Chains performed the song for the first time on TV on the British TV show Later... with Jools Holland on November 10, 2009, with host Jools Holland on piano. The song has not been performed live by Alice in Chains since their concert at the Key Arena in Seattle on October 8, 2010. Jerry Cantrell performed the song during his solo concert at the Pico Union Project in Los Angeles on December 6, 2019.

Marriage and family Following the death of her older sister, Vimala (at the age of sixteen) married her sister's widower, Don Charles Wijewardene (1893-1956), the fifth son of Don Philip Tudugala Wijewardene, a timber merchant of Sedavatta, and Helena Dep (née Weerasinghe) and younger brother of newspaper magnate Don Richard. They had three children, Ananda, Padmini and Rukmani. Don Charles, a polemicist espousing the Buddhist nationalist movement, was the author of The Revolt in the Temple (published in 1953). His mother, Helena, was responsible for arranging the financing of the restoration of the Kelaniya Raja Maha Vihara. Don Charles and his brother Don Walter had a strong involvement in the Kelaniya Temple and Buddhist affairs. He was also the patron of Mapitigama Buddharakkitha, as a young monk supporting his promotion to chief monk of the Kelaniya Temple. Political career In 1952 she contested the seat of Kelaniya at the 2nd parliamentary election, representing the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, against the United National Party incumbent (and her nephew), J. R. Jayewardene, losing by 6,235 votes. At the 3rd parliamentary elections in 1956, she ran in Mirigama electorate and was elected, receiving 36,193 votes (75.25% of the total vote) defeating the sitting member, John Amaratunga. In June 1956 she was appointed as Minister of Health in the S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike cabinet, the country's first female cabinet minister. In June 1959 she was appointed as the Minister for Local Government and Housing a position she retained in the subsequent Dahanayake cabinet. On 21 November 1959 she was arrested by the police in connection with the assassination of Prime Minister of Sri Lanka S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike, which led to her dismissal as Ceylon's Minister of Local Government. The charges against her were subsequently dropped on 15 July 1960. The incident effectively ended her political career and in her later life she turned to religion participating in Christian revival meetings. See also *Assassination of S. W. R. D.

He is well known for healing people through prayer (thapelo) and one of his mysteries was being born with a full set of teeth which disappeared a few days later. His spring in Qwaqwa is still one of the most visited spaces for spiritual healing. Early life Walter “Mazinyo” Matitta Phakoa was born in 1885 in Berea at a village called Ha Motsoene - Lesotho. This place was inhabited by AmaHlubi and AmaNgwane who moved to the area during the Mfecane/Difaqane Wars. Matitta was one of six children; namely, Sekota, Masoenyane, Thareni, Matitta, Nomacela and Mpharane. Regarding Matitta's birth, RM Mohono, fellow founder of the Moshoeshoe Berean Bible Readers Church (MBBRC), author and historian, wrote: Long ago among Basotho there was a prophetess by the name of Makhetha Mantsopa. She was a Christian. She lived at Lekhalong-la-bo-Tau, today known as Modderpoort. I believe, therefore, that she prophesied in a Christian spirit. A certain Zizi man and his wife, who lived in Lesotho, visited Mantsopa with their teenage daughter. The prophetess told them that their daughter would be married by a member of their extended family. Her fourth child would be a prophet like Mantsopa. The girl was later married by a relative. Her fourth child was a boy. He was born with teeth in his mouth so he was named Mazinyo, which means ‘teeth’ in their language. Life as a Prophet On reaching manhood, Matitta began to preach the gospel, travelling all parts of Lesotho and some parts of the Orange Free State – particularly QwaQwa. It was around the age of 25 that Matitta became a healer and prophet. He became widely known for his work. According to historian, GM Haliburton, in his book Walter Matitta and Josiel Lefela: A Prophet and a Politician in Lesotho: The pleasure loving Mattita was called from ‘the quicksands of sins’. He died and went to ‘where the heaven of the stars meets a higher heaven’ and was questioned by seven men. He was quickly sliding towards Satan - as he tried to block his way at every opportunity. After his release from the clutches of Satan he was taken up. ‘Here a court was assembled, the King on a higher throne, twenty four elders wearing golden crowns around him, four strange creatures each with four heads and five wings, and last of all Moshoeshoe and his war general Makoanyane, the two of them wearing sheepskin trousers'' As he related some of his visions, Matitta claimed that he had been in heaven and witnessed God and Satan argue over who he belonged to. While in heaven, he was taught by an angel to read and write. Upon his return, he spent 40 days and 40 nights on the mountain without food. When he returned, he then decided to become an evangelist under the Paris Evangelical Mission Society (PEMS) which was established in Lesotho in 1833. In 1922, Matitta founded the Moshoeshoe Berean Bible Readers Church (MBBRC), named after King Moshoeshoe I of the Basotho. This church was Ethiopian (African Independent Churches) in nature since it was grounded on a Reformed Confession, as seen in the lifestyle of its members and also having had no formal ties with the mission churches. Due to his work as a healer, Matitta soon gained a great following and became well known for this. He was later requested to live in Qwaqwa by Morena Ramatseliso Charles Mopeli (1918-1962) who was the Chief of the Bakoena in Qwaqwa. His church continued to grow in Lesotho but had however been abandoned by himself when he left for Qwaqwa. He then joined another Christian Church in Qwaqwa (church unknown). Soon after, he met Alice Mofutsanyana – mother of Thabo Mofutsanyana who was an author, politician and secretary of the Communist Party of South Africa. He soon started consulting people at the Mofutsanyana house. It is however unknown why Matitta had been invited to live in the Mofutsanyana residence. People began to flock their place of residence instead of the church. Matitta then decided to open another branch of the Moshoeshoe Berean Bible Readers Church. Due to this, the reverend of the church Matitta had been attending, sent him police which forced Matitta to hide in Leribe which is a small village in Qwaqwa. He later went to Natal where he became part of the Shembe church. Matitta later returned to Qwaqwa where he continued with his work as a healer. He then met Mr Leonard Liddell who owned the farm called Bluegumbosch (referred to as Letladi by the Basotho). Liddell had no children and he asked Matitta to pray for him. Soon after that he had two boys who were known by the Basotho as Mafotha and Mabasa. During one of the dry seasons, Matitta prayed to God for a fountain (Spring) which was granted to him and he called it the Spring of Life. He said that any person who drank from the Spring and asked God for anything in faith, they would receive it. The fountain currently is still in Qwaqwa and is now named after him as - Walter Matitta Spring. He used water from that spring to heal people. The spring which he had prayed to God for is provisionally declared as a provincial heritage site in the Free State. Spring of Prophet Matitta Qwaqwa. Although at first he had started a church, and also joined one when he went to Qwaqwa, he later decided not to form part of any church and would rather pray for people who needed healing. The church he had founded is still in existence in Lesotho and South Africa and is mostly followed by Basotho, however, there are Zulu people who also attend the church. Legacy Through a dream and vision, Matitta is said to have seen his death approaching and where his resting place would be. It was to be in the family ‘ash heap’ some twenty or so yards from his parental home and not in the public cemetery. In the rural areas, a person would be buried in the family yard, but Matitta was divinely given a different space. Some have alluded the significance to the prophet's choice of his resting place to propound the theory that he intended by that gesture to proclaim that place as belonging to the church he had founded and some maintain that this was equally supported by an inscription on one of the stones of the monument in which he placed his two daughters in the ‘trusteeship’ of the church. After his death in 1935, his followers collected funds and built up his grave into a monument.

History  Founded in 2015 in France, Liberapay began as a fork of the now-defunct US-based platform Gratipay.com, which had undergone changes after facing legal issues. Initially, Liberapay's only currency was the euro, but support for the US dollar was added after Gratipay announced that it would shut down, support for 31 other currencies was added a year later. In 2018, Liberapay had to respond to Mangopay withdrawing its services as payment processor. Support for two other payment processors was added, but the way the platform works had to change. In the same year Medium suspended the organisation's blog account, claiming they were publishing articles about cryptocurrencies. The account was reinstated six months later after an appeal.  Technical details  The service does not charge a fee on donations aside from that required by its payment processors, instead financing its own activity through donations handled by the service itself in the same way as donations to third-parties are handled. As of October 2020, Liberapay uses payment processors PayPal and Stripe. Notable projects on Liberapay include Archive.is, Battle for Wesnoth, GIMP, Mastodon, Matrix and Pepper&Carrot.; Liberapay shares similarities with the for-profit platform Patreon, but it does not allow creators to reward their patrons like Patreon does.

In May 2018, he became the first owner since 1952 to have Kentucky Oaks and Derby winners in the same weekend. He was a co-owner of Justify; winner of the Triple Crown – one of the hardest feats in sport. Early life The oldest of three siblings Kumin grew up in Worcester, Massachusetts before moving to Boston at the age of 10. He was educated at the Fessenden School before attending St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire. He went on to gain a BA in Political Science from Johns Hopkins University. Horse racing Specializing in buying proven established horses, Kumin has (and has had) a stake in a number of active and retired racehorses including Justify, Exaggerator, Lady Eli and Wavell Avenue and has been given credit for having \\"revolutionized the partnership concept.\\" In addition to purchasing stakes in proven racehorses, Kumin has also repeatedly invested in yearlings such as Monomoy Girl and Lady Eli. Kumin and his partners aim to own around 100 horses (with the majority fillies) at any one time. =2014 to 2016 – Lady Eli, Exaggerator and New Owner of the Year= Despite attending his first race while at college Kumin didn't get into horse- racing until much later through close friend Jay Hanley; the pair now comprising ownership group Sheep Pond Partners along with two other friends. After buying his first horse in 2014, Kumin's first high-profile winner was Lady Eli; purchased that same year. Named after his wife Elizabeth, Lady Eli won the Breeder's Cup in 2014 and then went on to claim six straight wins before being struck down with laminitis after stepping on a nail. Lady Eli before the Breeders' Cup In 2015, Kumin's Undrafted, which he co-owns with former American football wide receiver Wes Welker, won the Diamond Jubilee Stakes at Royal Ascot. Of Ascot, Kumin commented \\"It's an incredible place to win. When you stop and look around, the tradition and just the whole scene is different than anywhere in the world.\\" In 2016, Kumin bought a stake in the double Stakes winner Exaggerator in 2016 along with partners including Big Chief Racing and Ron Ortowski. Later that year Kumin was celebrating winning the Preakness Stakes; one of the Triple Crown Races. Kumin had been in the sport for less than a year when he was crowned New Owner of the Year for the United States for 2015 at the Thoroughbred Owner Conference in Florida in January 2016. =2016 to 2018 – Justify and the Triple Crown= At the Arlington Million in Chicago in August 2017, Kumin had two successes with Beach Patrol winning the Arlington Million and Dacita the Beverly D. Stakes. He went on to say he \\"had an unbelievable day\\" and that the Million was \\"the race we’ve been waiting for a year.\\" Following his horses' performances through the year, Kumin finished fourth in the 2017 Eclipse Awards behind Juddmonte Farms, Winchell Thoroughbreds and Godolphin Racing. In March 2018, Kumin bought stakes in two Kentucky Derby contenders; Audible and Justify. After My Boy Jack won the Lexington Stakes and gained 20 qualification points, this would mean that Kumin had three runners in the 2018 Derby. Justify would go on to win the race, with Audible finishing third and My Boy Jack fifth. This topped off a successful two days for Kumin after another of his horses; Monomoy Girl won the Kentucky Oaks the same weekend. With two wins, Kumin became the first owner to achieve the Derby-Oaks double in 66 years. Topping off the weekend was another of his horses Yoshida who was victorious in the Old Forester Turf Classic. Of the weekend, Kumin commented \\"It was a ridiculous weekend. We had two awesome days with the Derby/Oaks weekend and winning three grade ones.\\" Later that month, Justify landed another victory at the Preakness Stakes meaning it had won two of the three Triple Crown races with the third to be decided the following month at the Belmont Stakes. The win meant that Kumin's horses had won the Preakness Stakes in two out of three years. Justify then went on to win the Belmont Stakes, and thus became only the 13th Triple Crown winner. Justify wins the Belmont Stakes. In August 2018, Kumin's horse Catholic Boy won the Travers Stakes in Saratoga Springs, New York. Of the win, Kumin said \\"The Travers was a bucket list race for me.\\" In November 2018, Monomoy Girl would follow her Kentucky Oaks' win with victory in the Longines Breeders’ Cup Distaff.

Stephanie Ekowa, August 19, 2017.Landslide kills 40 in northeast DR Congo, The East African. Thursday August 17, 2017. The disaster killed at least 200 people. Much of the damage is attributed to poorly regulated housing in vulnerable mountainous regions and heavy deforestation. Events Heavy rainfall impacted the Ituri province in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo) on the night of 15 August 2017. West African countries, including the DR Congo, are susceptible to devastating landslides as a growing demand for residential properties force communities to crowd hillsides. Large scale deforestation, occurring in regions throughout the country, incurs significant adverse soil erosion, heightening the threat of slope failure. A mountainside situated on the western banks of Lake Albert collapsed on 16 August, triggering a landslide which impacted the fishing village of Tora. Initial estimates reported about 40 people were killed by the distaster with as many as 200 others missing. The following day, the province's deputy governor Pacifique Keta announced the death toll had risen to 200 and 50 properties were completely submerged. Four other victims were treated for injuries at Tshomia Hospital. Deputy governor Keta declared a state of emergency and appealed to the international community for support with relief efforts. Following the landslide in Tora, search and rescue teams from the Red Cross of the DR Congo recovered 44 bodies from the disaster area in the first day. Persistent rainfall disrupted recovery missions, as did the region's topography. The United Nations (UN) sent a humanitarian team to evacuate survivors and assess the damage.

As described in the anonymous 1572 account documented in Volume 3 of Blair and Robertson's compiled translations: > This said village had about a thousand inhabitants, and was surrounded by > very tall and very dense bamboo thickets, and fortified with a wall and a > few small culverins. The same river as that of Manilla circles around the > village and a branch of it passes through the middle dividing it in two > sections. The Siege of Cainta (August 1571)  When the Spanish forces of Miguel López de Legazpi first established the City of Manila in 1571, Cainta was one of the surrounding polities who went to Manila to negotiate for friendship with Manila. However, Cainta's envoys noted the small size of Legaspi's forces and decided to withdraw their offer of friendship, since Cainta was a fortified polity which was perfectly capable of defending itself. In August 1571, Legazpi assigned his nephew, Juan de Salcedo, to \\"pacify\\" Cainta. After travelling several days upriver, Salcedo lay siege to the city, and eventually found a weak spot on the wall. The final Spanish attack over 400 residents of Cainta killed. Dissolution  It was established as a visita (annex) of Taytay on November 30, 1571, under the administration of the Jesuits.

Williams was the son of Col. Griffith Williams of Arianws, near Llangelynin, Caernarvonshire and his wife Mary Williams and was born in 1718. He entered the army in 1739 and was captain in the 34th Foot in 1744. He succeeded to the baronetcy on the death of his cousin Sir Robert Williams, 7th Baronet in November 1745. In 1756 he was a major in the 6th Foot and was at Minorca when the garrison was attacked in that year. In 1759 he was in a volunteer battalion in the 85th Foot. Williams married Emma, the dowager Viscountess Bulkeley, widow of James Bulkeley, 6th Viscount Bulkeley on 28 June 1760. She was daughter of Thomas Rowlands of Caerau, Anglesey, but as her father disapproved of Williams, the marriage was kept secret. Correspondence indicates that Williams was becoming involved in politics in Beaumaris, partly in the interest of his stepson Thomas Bulkeley, but was handicapped by the secrecy of his marriage. In the course of these dealings he became Lt Colonel in the 53rd Foot in 1761 and became Constable of Beaumaris castle in July 1761. However his regiment was stationed in Gibraltar and he was ordered back there. He disliked the climate and wished to be transferred to a regiment at home. As this was refused he retired from the army on half-pay in December 1764 to take care of affairs at Beaumaris. In 1768 he was elected Member of Parliament for Beaumaris but made little contribution. His stepson Thomas Bulkeley joined him in parliament in 1774 and was encouraging him to take a greater interest. However he found parliamentary business tiresome and stood down in 1780. He was returned as MP for Beaumaris in a by-election in 1785 and retained the seat until his death on 19 August 1794. Williams had two sons and two daughters and was succeeded by his son Robert.

Starring Mary Joy Apostol, Arnold Reyes, Ku Aquino, and John Arcilla, its story revolves around a farm girl (Apostol) in the countryside, who unwittingly kills a Philippine eagle (an endangered species locally known as the haribon), and two police officers (Reyes and Arcilla) assigned to track down the haribon's killer while investigating the mysterious disappearance of a busload of farmers en route to Manila. The film was selected as the Filipino entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 90th Academy Awards, but it was not nominated. Birdshot is the first Filipino film released worldwide by Netflix. Plot Diego Mariano (Ku Aquino) is the caretaker of the land surrounding a sanctuary; he is the father of 14-year-old Maya (Mary Joy Apostol), whose mother died from childbirth. Maya wants to explore the land beyond the family's isolated shack. Diego wants his daughter to be self-sufficient, so he teaches her to fire a gun. After failing her first shooting lessons, Maya wanders off to the forest sanctuary with her father's dual barrel shotgun and deliberately kills a Philippine eagle, an endangered animal. Meanwhile, newly-recruited police officer Domingo (Arnold Reyes) goes to the area to investigate the mysterious disappearance of farmers en route to Manila on a bus, but is ordered to stop. Domingo's partner Mendoza (John Arcilla) and their commander De la Paz (Dido de la Paz) believes that Domingo should focus on finding the killer of the Philippine eagle instead. Cast *Mary Joy Apostol as Maya *Arnold Reyes as Domingo *John Arcilla as Mendoza *Ku Aquino as Diego Production Birdshot was directed by Mikhail Red who also made the screenplay with cousin Rae Red. Red was also the film editor opposite Jay Halili. The cinematographer was Mycko David. The music used in the film was composed by Teresa Barrozo. Red and his cousin began writing the script in 2014. Producer Pamela L. Reyes submitted it to the Doha Film Institute which in early 2015 granted production funding for the film. After winning the CJ Entertainment Award at the Busan Film Festival's Asian Project Market, other investors granted funding, including TBA Studios. The film project was selected at the Festival des 3 Continents' Produire au Sud workshop to improve Birdshot and its screenplay. Birdshot's PelikulaRED studio (owned by Reyes and Red) managed to co-produce the film with Tuko Film Productions and Buchi Boy Productions. The total budget of the film was . Red was inspired by a shooting incident in 2008, where a three-year-old Philippine eagle was shot by a Bukidnon farmer in Mount Kitanglad who cooked the killed bird afterwards. Principal photography lasted for 23 days. Scenes were shot in the provinces of Isabela and Rizal as well as the Philippine Eagle Sanctuary in Davao City. The color red is a prominent element in the film which signifies an important scene or pertinent detail that the audience is required to pay closer attention to. Release Birdshot was first screened at film festivals outside the Philippines before it was screened in the country. The film made its debut at the 2016 Tokyo International Film Festival and was screened in 14 other film festivals before it made its local debut at the 13th Cinemalaya Independent Film Festival in August of the following year. The film was also screened as one of the twelve official entries at the 2017 Pista ng Pelikulang Pilipino. Streaming service Netflix acquired the film and was released on the platform on March 26, 2018 worldwide. Birdshot will become the first Filipino produced film to be made available in Netflix Philippines. Another Philippine film, On the Job, was already made available in the North America service of the online platform. Reception Film critic Richard Kuipers praised Birdshot in a review published in Variety describing the film as a \\"gripping combination of police procedural and coming-of-age drama\\". He paralleled the film's commentary to the 2009 Maguindanao massacre and remarked on Apostol's performance in particular as \\"impressive\\". Additional praise was also given by Kuiper to Teresa Barrozo's \\"haunting soundscapes\\". The film won Best Picture in the Asian Future category at the 2016 Tokyo International Film Festival and was selected for the Ingmar Bergman International Debut Award at the Goteborg Film Festival.

It originates in the Sacred Headwaters region, and flows about south to the Nass River.Length calculated in Google Earth using the path tool. It course lies between the Oweegee Range of the Skeena Mountains to the east and the Boundary Ranges of the Coast Mountains to the west. The Bell- Irving River's watershed is within the traditional territory of several First Nations and there have been conflicting claims. The main peoples whose histories involve the Bell-Irving River are the Gitxsan (also spelled Gitksan), Gitanyow, Nisga'a, Tahltan, and Tsetsaut. Name The river's name honors Canadian Army Lieutenant Duncan Peter Bell-Irving, BCLS, of Vancouver. Before World War I Bell-Irving was exploring and surveying the upper Nass River system. When war broke out he enlisted and served with the 2nd Field Company, Canadian Engineers. On February 25, 1915, in Belgium, he was shot and killed by a sniper. There are various indigenous names for the Bell-Irving River. The Gitxsan name is Sto'ot Xsitxemsem. The Tahltan have been known to call the Bell-Irving River the West Nass River. Course The Bell-Irving River originates in the Klappan Range and an area known as the Sacred Headwaters, which gives rise to not just the Bell-Irving, but also the Nass, Skeena, and Stikine Rivers, as well as numerous tributary streams such as the Klappan River, Tumeka Creek, and Sweeney Creek, tributaries of the Klappan River; and the Ningunsaw River, a tributary of the Iskut River. The source of the Unuk River is just southwest of the Sacred Headwaters area, rising near the source of Treaty Creek, a tributary of the Bell-Irving River. North of the Bell-Irving River lies the watersheds of the Stikine River and its largest tributary, the Iskut River. To the west of the Bell-Irving are the Coast Mountains and the headwaters of the Unuk River, which flows southwest to the sea near Ketchikan, Alaska, and the Bear River, which flows south to the head of Portland Canal at the community of Stewart, British Columbia. From its source the Bell-Irving River flows generally south through mostly mountainous terrain. It is joined by Craven Creek, then Rochester Creek. The Yukon Telegraph Trail follows Rochester Creek and part of the Bell-Irving River. The Yukon Telegraph line, also called the Dominion Telegraph, grew out of part of the earlier, failed Russian–American Telegraph, and connected Ashcroft, BC, to Dawson City, Yukon. The telegraph trail was built during the Klondike Gold Rush and promoted as an All-Canadian Route to the Yukon gold fields. Below Rochester Creek the Bell-Irving River flows southwest. Owl Creek, whose headwaters lie near Mount Alger, joins the Bell-Irving from the northwest. Hodder Creek joins near a locality called Bell II, where the Stewart–Cassiar Highway crosses the Bell-Irving River. Just downstream the Bell-Irving is joined by Teigen Creek from the west, whose source lies close to the source of the Unuk River. The Yukon Telegraph Trail and the Stewart–Cassiar Highway leave the Bell-Irving here and follow Teigen Creek and its tributary Snowbank Creek north to Ningunsaw Pass, then along Beaverpond Creek and the Ningunsaw River to Bob Quinn Lake and Bob Quinn Lake Airport. Below Teigen Creek the Bell-Irving River turns south and southeast. This part of the river valley is used by the Stewart–Cassiar Highway, British Columbia Highway 37. Snowslide Range lies west of the river, between Teigen Creek and Treaty Creek. Oweegee Creek and Skowill Creek join from the east, then Treaty Creek joins from the west. Treaty Creek is so named because it marks the traditional boundary between Nisga'a and Tahltan territories, following a mid-19th century treaty made between these peoples. Below Treaty Creek the Bell-Irving is joined by Deltaic Creek from the east, then Wildfire Creek from the west, then Taft Creek from the northeast. Continuing south, the Bell-Irving is flanked on the west by Wildfire Ridge, which separates it from Bowser Lake. Ritchie Creek and Cousins Creek, flowing down from Mount Ritchie, join the Bell-Irving from the east. A few kilometers south the Bell-Irving River is joined by the Bowser River from the west. The Bowser River flows from Summit Lake and through Bowser Lake, and collects water from many large glaciers. South of the Bowser River confluence the Stewart–Cassiar Highway crosses the Bell-Irving River again and leaves the river valley, heading south while the river bends to the southeast, around the east side of Mount Bell-Irving. Irving Creek joins the river from the northeast, after which the Bell-Irving River heads south to its confluence with the Nass River, a few kilometers east of Meziadin Junction. Wildlife The Bell-Irving River and its tributaries support diverse fish communities. They are used for spawning by Chinook salmon, Coho salmon, and Sockeye salmon, and by summer-run anadromous (sea-run) Steelhead trout and Cutthroat trout. They also provide habitat for resident (non-anadromous) Rainbow trout and Cutthroat trout, Dolly Varden trout, Bull trout, and Mountain whitefish. Eulachon, a small anadromous fish, was historically extremely important to the indigenous people of the Pacific Northwest Coast, and the Nass River was particularly famous for its eulachon runs. However, eulachon distribution is primarily restricted to the lower reaches of the Nass River and does not extend to the Bell-Irving River. Some terrestrial species of the Bell-Irving River watershed include marten, moose, mountain goat, grizzly bear, western toad, and wetland birds including waterfowl and wading birds such as dabbling duckss, geese, common goldeneye, and harlequin duck. History The Bell-Irving River's watershed is within the traditional territory of several First Nations and there have been conflicting claims. The main peoples whose histories involve the Bell-Irving River are the Gitxsan (also spelled Gitksan), Gitanyow, Nisga'a, Tahltan, and Tsetsaut. The Gitxsan adaawk, a type of oral history, describe thousands of years of history. Migrations into the postglacial Nass River basin occurred from three main settlements, including one, called Ts'im'anluuskeexs, on the Bell-Irving River between the Bowser River and Treaty Creek. Some of the Ts'im'anluuskeexs migrated south, establishing the Houses of the Gitanyou. Others remained and established the Houses of the Galdo'o. Starting about 200–300 years ago a series of conflicts occurred between the Gitxsan and groups of Tsetsaut, Tahltan, and others. These conflicts were long and complicated, and occurred in several distinct phases over a large area, including the Bell-Irving River watershed. Some of the conflicts related to geopolitical changes caused by the increasing presence of European and American maritime fur traders on the coast. One conflict between the Gitanyow and Tsetsaut resulted in the defeat of the Tsetsaut and a formal transfer of territory including most of the Bell- Irving River and its tributaries, as well as the upper Nass River and other areas. By around 1860 the Eastern Tsetsaut had established a village called Awiijii (or Oweegee) on the Bell-Irving River near Bowser Lake. Gitxsan adaawk describe an accidental killing of the Gitxsan chief Xskiigmlaxha, which resulted in the Eastern Tsetsaut of Awiijii having to forfeit a large part of their territory in the area to the nephews of the dead Gitxsan chief. In this way much of the Bell-Irving River watershed became Gitxsan territory, according to Gitxsan adaawk. The name of Treaty Creek, near Awiijii, comes from this event. By the time Franz Boas wrote about the Eastern Tsetsaut in the 1890s they had relocated to the upper Stikeen River. This transfer of territory is particularly well documented and important for the Gitxsan and Gitanyow's efforts to acquire aboriginal title to their lands. However, the Skii km Lax Ha, present-day descendants of the Raven Clan of the Laxwiiyip Tsetsaut who have not been amalgamated with the Nisga'a like many other Tsetsaut, claim the entire Bell-Irving River watershed along with the upper Nass River and other areas. Land claim disagreement between the Gitxsan and Nisga'a led to the Gitxsan and their neighbors, the Wet'suwet'en, to take the issue of territorial ownership to court in the case of Delgamuukw v British Columbia. This case began in 1984 and continued until 1997. Although the Supreme Court of Canada declined to make any definitive statement on aboriginal title a vast amount of research was conducted and documented and it was ruled that oral histories were just as important as written testimony. The case also played an important role in the Nisga'a Treaty, which came into effect on May 11, 2000, and affirmed Nisga'a ownership of lands focused along the lower Nass River. As of 2017, neither the Gitxsan nor the Gitanyow have not reached final treaty agreements. Their claims include much of the Bell- Irving River watershed. Geology The Bell-Irving volcanic district is located in the upper Bell-Irving River watershed. It is considered part of the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province. Between 1992 and 2004 fourteen previously undescribed volcanic occurrences were found, documented, and assigned to the Bell-Irving volcanic district. All fourteen have pillow lava deposits and/or volcaniclastic rocks, and were probably created by Pleistocene alpine glaciovolcanic eruptions.

She served as a bacteriologist during World War I, and was the third scientist and the first woman appointed to work at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research after its establishment in 1915. She directed a laboratory studying infectious diseases, and had particular expertise in dysentery, hydatid disease and snake venom. She co-founded Australia's first blood bank.  Early life and education  Fannie Eleanor Williams was born in Adelaide, South Australia on 4 July 1884. She was the second child and eldest daughter of James Williams and his wife Helen DuBois. Williams grew up in The Reedbeds, near Henley Beach, where her father was a farmer. Williams trained as a nurse at the Adelaide Children's Hospital between 1904 and 1907. She was appointed sister in charge of the Thomas Elder Laboratory in 1907, and worked there for two years as an assistant to pathologist Dr Thomas Borthwick. In December 1909, Williams took up a position as nurse inspector with the Unley Local Board of Health for which she undertook home visits and tested patients for diphtheria, measles, and other notifiable diseases. In 1911, Williams returned to work with Dr Borthwick as an attendant in a new pathology research laboratory at the Adelaide Hospital. She was the first woman in South Australia to hold such an appointment. She remained in this role until late 1914. Wartime service Mudros Harbour. The nursing sister is Sister Fanny .E. Williams. After the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Eleanor Williams was invited by Dr Trent Champion de Crespigny to join him on active service with the First Australian Imperial Force. Infectious disease was emerging as a significant issue for the campaign in Turkey and the Middle East, and the army wanted to recruit people with bacteriological and laboratory training to work on the problem. Accordingly, Williams enlisted with the Australian Army Nursing Service on 20 July 1915 and embarked for Egypt a fortnight later on the RMS Orontes. On arrival, Williams was posted to the 3rd Australian General Hospital on the island of Lemnos in Greece. This was one of the hospitals that received patients from the Gallipoli Campaign. Williams' record at the Australian War Memorial states that she enlisted with the rank of Staff Nurse on 20 July 1915, and rose to the rank of Temporary Sister. She served in Egypt, Lemnos, England and France, was mentioned twice in despatches, and was awarded the Royal Red Cross (2nd Class). Although Williams enlisted as a nurse, she worked exclusively in the laboratory as a bacteriologist, the only Australian woman to serve in such a capacity. Working alongside Dr Charles James Martin, Director of the Lister Institute, she performed ground-breaking work on dysentery, and quickly became known as an expert in this field. She continued to work with Martin throughout the war, on a variety of infectious diseases, including meningitis, streptococci, staphylococci, gas gangrene, and epidemic influenza.  Scientific career  Following her repatriation in 1919, Eleanor Williams moved to Melbourne, and was appointed to the position of 'second assistant' at the newly-established Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research by director Sydney Patterson. Williams had worked with Patterson on influenza during the war. She was the third staff member appointed to the Institute, and the first woman. She was also the only researcher with no medical or university qualification. In the early 1920s, the Institute's focus was on respiratory and intestinal infections, and Williams worked on pneumonia, syphilis and dysentery, as well as the serological diagnosis of hydatid tapeworms. From 1923, she worked with Charles Kellaway on snake venom serology, and later worked on tuberculosis. Williams occupied a position somewhere between that of research scientist, senior technician and general manager. While her lack of academic qualifications prevented her from lecturing at the University of Melbourne, she established and led the Institute's Diagnostic Microbiology Laboratory, and attended international and national conferences where she presented papers in her own right. As the Institute grew in the late 1930s, Williams took on the responsibility for training and managing the Institute's research technicians. The training she provided was extremely thorough, and covered elements as diverse as animal care, the preparation of media and broths for bacterial culture, and glassblowing. She also trained junior scientists in practical bacteriology techniques. Among her trainees was Frank Macfarlane Burnet, who later described her as \\"the centre of commonsense and helpfulness around which all the activities of the Institute rotated\\". During World War II, Williams coordinated the Institute's war efforts, providing administrative and practical support to the Emergency Blood Transfusion Service, as well as working in the laboratory. She retired in 1957, and received an MBE for her work in the same year.  Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service  Eleanor Williams was closely involved with The Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service (now the Australian Red Cross Blood Service) from its inception in 1929 by the Victorian Division of the Australian Red Cross Society. In the first decade of the service, laboratory tests were carried out at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, under the supervision of Williams and her colleague Dr Ian Wood. The ability to deliver blood transfusions was limited by the lack of a blood bank, which would allow donated blood to be stored for future needs. In 1938, with World War II approaching, the decision was made to establish a blood bank at the Royal Melbourne Hospital, and Williams and Wood turned their attention to developing new techniques for storing blood and plasma, as well as to the logistical aspects of obtaining and administering the blood. The new Emergency Blood Transfusion Service was founded in May 1939 by Williams and Wood, with Williams managing the technical and administrative aspects of the service and Wood ensuring the supply of blood and serum in the field. Once war was declared, Williams' team immediately began testing and recording the blood groups of all soldiers prior to embarkation, so that blood transfusions could more efficiently be performed in the field. In the first year of the war alone, her team, working as volunteers and in addition to their daily laboratory work, performed blood typing for 13,000 soldiers of the Second Australian Imperial Force. By the end of the war, Williams' team had performed blood typing for nearly 250,000 soldiers and numerous blood donors, all on a volunteer basis.  Death and legacy  Eleanor Williams died on 16 June 1963, aged 78. She was cremated, and her ashes were scattered at the Springvale Botanical Cemetery. She was recognised with an obituary in The Medical Journal of Australia, written by Frank Macfarlane Burnet and Dr Ian Wood, which spoke of her 'remarkable knowledge, keen sense of humour, and tenacity of purpose'. In 1964, as part of their Golden Jubilee celebrations, the Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service named their new laboratories the F. Eleanor Williams Serological Research Laboratories in her honour.

Biography  Jean-Pierre Déricoyard was born on 21 July 1907 to an Azande family in Bambili, Orientale Province, Belgian Congo. He attended the Ecole Officielle des candidats-commis in Stanleyville before studying at the Frères Maristes in 1915. He earned his diploma in 1924 with distinction. After six years of work in the colonial administration he served as a clerk for various companies. He later moved to Léopoldville where in 1949 he established Déricoyard Fréres, a furniture and trade business. Déricoyard rose to prominence in the private sector and his venture became one of the most successful Congolese-owned firms in the capital. At the time he was the only Zande to achieve such status in the region. He eventually became an administrator of a Congolese businessmen cooperative and the leader of an ethnic association for people from Ituri and the Uélés. Déricoyard also became the president of the Frères Maristes alumni association. In 1956 he participated in a conference organised by the Solvay Institute of Sociology to discuss the Congolese economy. Two years later he attended the All-African Peoples' Conference in Accra, Ghana as an observer. In April 1959 he founded the Parti Travailliste Congolais, a political party. At his initiative, the organisation urged the colonial administration to hold a round table conference to discuss the political future of the Congo. In the general elections of May 1960 Déricoyard won a seat in the Chamber of Deputies with 5,509 preferential votes. On 18 December 1962 a motion of censure was tabled against Déricoyard in the Chamber of Deputies, who was serving as Minister of Economic Affairs. Three days later the motion was debated by the Chamber. Déricoyard's critics accused him of engaging in corrupt activities in the northeast and failing to do enough to control commodity prices and curtail black market activities. The motion ultimately failed, 30 votes to 57 with 7 abstentions. Following the 1965 general elections, Déricoyard was made provisional President of the Chamber of Deputies while the elected candidates' credentials were confirmed.

Initially, from 1950–54, the reception of cybernetics, in the Soviet Union, was exclusively negative. The Soviet Department for Agitation and Propaganda had called for anti-Americanism to be intensified in Soviet media, and in an attempt to fill the Department's quotas, Soviet journalists latched on to cybernetics as an American \\"reactionary pseudoscience\\" to denounce and mock. This attack was interpreted as a signal of an official attitude to cybernetics, so, under Joseph Stalin's premiership, cybernetics was inflated into \\"a full embodiment of imperialist ideology\\" by Soviet writers. Upon Stalin's death, the wide-reaching reforms of Nikita Khrushchev's premiership allowed cybernetics to legitimise itself as \\"a serious, important science\\", and in 1955, articles on cybernetics were published in the state philosophical organ, Voprosy Filosofii, after several Soviet scientists realised the potential of this new science. Under the formerly suppressive scientific culture of the Soviet Union, cybernetics began to serve as an umbrella term for previously maligned areas of soviet science, such as structural linguistics and Lamarckist genetics . Under the headsmanship of academician Aksel Berg, the Council of Cybernetics was formed, an umbrella organisation dedicated to providing funding for these new lights of soviet science. By the 1960s, this fast legitimisation put cybernetics \\"in fashion\\" as career-minded scientists used cybernetics as a buzzword, and the Council began to take on a life of its own. Many of the original cyberneticians of the organisation began to grow disgruntled; complaints were made that Berg seemed more focused on administration than scientific research, Berg devising grand plans for the council to subsume \\"practically all of Soviet science\\". By the 1980s, cybernetics had lost relevance in Soviet scientific culture, as its terminology and political function was succeeded by those of informatics in the Soviet Union and, eventually, post-Soviet states. Official criticism: 1950-1954 The initial public reception of cybernetics in the Soviet Union, in the stifling scientific culture of Joseph Stalin, was exclusively negative. Under the plans of the Soviet Department for Agitation and Propaganda, Soviet anti-American propaganda was to be intensified, in order \\"to show the decay of bourgeois culture and morals\\" and \\"debunk the myths of American propaganda\\" in the wake of the formation of NATO. This imperative put Soviet newspaper editors in a frantic search for topics to criticise, in order to fill these propagandistic quotas. The first to latch onto Cybernetics was science journalist, Boris Agapov, following the post-war American interest in the developments in computer technology. The cover of the January 23, 1950 issue of Time had boasted an anthropomorphic cartoon of a Harvard Mark III under the slogan \\"Can Man Build a Superman?\\". On 4 May 1950, Agapov published an article in the Literaturnaya Gazeta entitled \\"Mark III, a Calculator\\", ridiculing this American excitement at the \\"sweet dream\\" of the military and industrial uses of these new \\"thinking machines\\", and criticising Wiener as an example of the \\"charlatans and obscurantists, whom capitalists substitute for genuine scientists\\". Though it was not commissioned by any Soviet authority and never mentioned the science by name, Agapov's article was taken as a signal of an official critical attitude towards cybernetics; editions of Norbert Wiener's Cybernetics were removed from library circulation, and several other periodicals followed suit, denouncing cybernetics as a \\"reactionary pseudoscience\\". In 1951, , of the Institute of Philosophy, led a public campaign against the philosophy of \\"semantic idealism\\", characterising Wiener, and cybernetics as a whole, as a part of this \\"reactionary philosophy\\". In 1952, another more explicitly anti- cybernetic article was published in the Literaturnaya Gazeta, definitively starting the campaign and leading the way for a flurry of popular titles denouncing the topic. At the zenith of this criticism, an article in the October 1953 issue of the state ideological organ, Voprosy Filosofii, was published under the pseudonym \\"Materialist\\", entitled \\"Whom Does Cybernetics Serve?\\"; it condemned cybernetics as a \\"misanthropic pseudo-theory\\" consisting of \\"mechanicism turning into idealism\\", pointing to the American military as the \\"god whom cybernetics served\\". During this period, Stalin himself never engaged in this rabid criticism of cybernetics, with the head of the Soviet Department of Sciences, Iurii Zhdanov, recalling that \\"he never opposed cybernetics\\" and made every effort \\"to advance computer technology\\" in order to give the USSR the technological advantage. Though the scale of this campaign was modest, with only around 10 anti-cybernetic publications being produced, Valery Shilov has argued it constituted a \\"strict directive to action\\" from the \\"central ideological organs\\", a universal declaration of cybernetics as a bourgeois pseudoscience to be criticised and destroyed. Few of these critics had any access to primary sources on cybernetics: Agapov's sources were limited to the January 1950 issue of Time; the Institute's criticisms were based on the 1949 volume of ETC: A Review of General Semantics; and, among Soviet articles on cybernetics, only the \\"Materialist\\" quoted Wiener's Cybernetics directly. Select sensational quotes of Wiener and speculations based \\"exclusively on the basis of other [Soviet] books already written on the same or similar subject\\", were used to characterise Wiener as both an idealist and a mechanicist, criticising his supposed reduction of scientific and sociological ideas to mere \\"mechanical model[s]\\". Wiener's gloomy speculations on the \\"second industrial revolution\\" and the \\"assembly line without human agents\\" were distorted to brand him as a \\"technocrat\\", wishing for \\"the process of production realised without workers, only with machines controlled by the gigantic brain of the computer\\" with \\"no strikes or strike movements, and moreover no revolutionary insurrections\\". According to Slava Gerovitch, \\"each critic carried criticism one step further, gradually inflating the significance of cybernetics until it was seen as a full embodiment of imperialist ideology\\". Legitimisation and rise: 1954-1961 Joseph Stalin and Nikita Khrushchev, 1936; the death of Stalin (right) and accession of Khrushchev (left) in 1953, alongside the following political thaw, allowed cybernetics to be legitimised in the Soviet Union. The reformed academic culture of the Soviet Union, after the death of Stalin and reforms of the Khrushchev era, allowed cybernetics to tear down its previous ideological criticisms and redeem itself in the public view. To Soviet scientists, cybernetics emerged as possible vector of escape from the ideological traps of Stalinism, replacing it with the computational objectivity of cybernetics. Military computer scientist Anatoly Kitov recalled stumbling onto Cybernetics in the secret library of the Special Construction Bureau and realising instantly, cybernetics was \\"not a bourgeois pseudo-science, as official publications considered it at the time, but the opposite - a serious, important science\\". He joined with the dissident mathematician Alexey Lyapunov, and, in 1952, presented a pro-cybernetic paper to Voprosy Filosofii, which the journal tacitly endorsed, though the Communist Party required that Lyapunov and Kitov present public lectures on cybernetics before its publication, with 121 seminars produced in total from 1944-45. A very different academic, the Soviet philosopher and former ideological watchdog Ernst Kolman, also joined this rehabilitation. In November 1954, Kolman presented a lecture at the Academy of Social Sciences, condemning this stifling of cybernetics to a shocked audience, who had expected a lecture rehearsing previous Stalinist criticisms, and marched down to the office of Voprosy Filosofii to have his lecture published. The beginning of a Soviet cybernetic movement was therefore first signaled by two articles, published together in the July–August 1955 volume of Voprosy Filosofii: \\"The Main Features of Cybernetics\\" by Sergei Sobolev, Alexey Lyapunov, and Anatoly Kitov, and \\"What is Cybernetics\\" by Ernst Kolman. According to Benjamin Peters, these \\"two Soviet articles set the stage for the revolution of cybernetics in the Soviet Union\\". The first article - authored by three Soviet military scientists - attempted to present the tenets of cybernetics as a coherent scientific theory, retooling it for Soviet use; they purposely avoided any discussion of philosophy, and presented Wiener as an American anti-capitalist, in order to avoid any politically dangerous confrontation. They asserted cybernetics' main tenets as: (1) information theory, (2) the theory of automatic high-speed electronic calculating machines as a theory of self-organising logical processes, and (3) the theory of automatic control systems (particularly, the theory of feedback). In juxtaposition, Kolman's defense of cybernetics mirrored the Stalinist criticisms it had endured. Kolman created a spurious historiography of cybernetics (which inevitably found its origins in Soviet science) and corrected the supposed \\"deviations\\" of the anti-cybernetic philosophers, employing well-placed quotes from Marxist authorities and philosophical epithets (e.g. \\"idealist\\" or \\"vitalist\\"), implying cybernetics' opponents fell into the same philosophical errors Marx and Lenin had criticised decades earlier, within their dialectical materialist framework. Thus, Soviet cybernetics began its journey towards legitimisation. Academician Aksel Berg, at the time Deputy Minister of Defence, authored secret reports, beleaguering the deficient state of information science in the USSR, pointing towards the suppression of cybernetics as the prime culprit. Party officials allowed a small Soviet delegation to be sent to the First International Congress on Cybernetics in June 1956, who informed the Party of the extent to which USSR was \\"lagging behind the developed countries\\" in computer technology. Unfavorable descriptions of cybernetics were removed from official literature, and in 1958, the first Russian translations of Wiener were published. The first Soviet journal on cybernetics, Problemy Kibernetiki [Problems of Cybernetics], was published, edited by Lyapunov. For the 1960 First International Federation of Automatic Control, Wiener came to Russia to lecture on cybernetics at the Polytechnic Museum. He arrived to see the hall that had been booked swarmed with scientists eager to hear his lecture, some of whom sat on aisles and stairs to hear him speak; several Soviet publications, including the formerly anti-cybernetic Voprosy Filosofii, crammed in to get interviews from Wiener. In the Krushchev Thaw, Soviet cybernetics had not only been legitimised as a science, but had entered the vogue in Soviet academia. On 10 April 1959, Berg sent a report, edited by Lyapunov, to a presidium of the Academy of Sciences, recommending the establishment of an organisation dedicated to advancing cybernetics. The presidium determined that the Council on Cybernetics would be formed, with Berg as the chairman (due to his strong administrative connections) and Lyapunov his deputy. This council was wide-reaching, subsuming as many as 15 disciplines as of 1967, from \\"cybernetic linguistics\\" to \\"legal cybernetics\\". During Khrushchev's relaxation of scientific culture, the Council on Cybernetics served as an umbrella organisation for formerly suppressed research, including such subjects as non-Pavlovian physiology (\\"physiological cybernetics\\"), structural linguistics (\\"cybernetic linguistics\\"), and Lamarckist genetics (\\"biological cybernetics\\"). Thanks to Lyapunov, a further, 20 person Department of Cybernetics was created, in order to solicit official funding for cybernetic research. Even with these institutions, Lyapunov still lamented that \\"the field of cybernetics in our country is not organized\\", and, from 1960-1, worked with the Department to establish an official Institute of Cybernetics. Lyapunov joined forces with the structural linguists, who had been authorised to create Institute of Semiotics directed by Andrey Markov Jr., and, in June 1961, together planned to create an Institute of Cybernetics. Despite these efforts, Lyapunov lost faith in the project after Krushchev's refusal to build more Moscow scientific institutes, and the Institute never emerged, settling with the Council of Cybernetics instead gaining the formal powers of an institute, without any expansion of staff. Peak and decline: 1961-1980s Number of authors engaged in each discipline of the Institute of Automation and Remote Control, from 1950-69. Berg continued with his campaign for soviet cybernetics into the 1960s as cybernetics entered the soviet mainstream. Berg's council sponsored pro- cybernetic programmes in Soviet media; with 20-minute radio broadcasts, entitled \\"Cybernetics in Our Lives\\", a series of broadcasts on Moscow TV, detailing advances in computer technology, alongside hundreds of lectures before various party members and workers on cybernetics. In 1961, the council produced an official volume proffering cybernetics, entitled Cybernetics—in the Service of Communism. The work of the council was rewarded when, at the 22nd Party Congress, cybernetics was declared one of the \\"major tools of the creation of a communist society\\". Khrushchev declared the development of cybernetics to be an \\"imperative\\" in Soviet science. According to Gerovitch, this put cybernetics \\"in fashion\\" as \\"many career-minded scientists began using 'cybernetics' as a buzzword\\" and the movement swelled with its new membership. The CIA reported that the July 1962 'Conference on the Philosophical Problems of Cybernetics' received \\"approximately 1000 specialists, mathematicians, philosophers, physicists, economists, psychologists, biologists, engineers, linguists, physicians\\" In July 1962, Berg created a plan for the radical restructuring of the Council such that it covered \\"practically all of Soviet science\\". This was met with cold reception from many of the researchers of the Council, with one cybernetician complaining, in a letter to Liapunov, that \\"[t]here are almost no results from the Council. Berg only demands paperwork and strives for the expansion of the Council.\\" Liapunov, disgruntled with Berg and the non-academic direction of cybernetics, refused to write for Cybernetics—in the Service of Communism and gradually lost his influence in cybernetics. As one memoirist put it, this resignation meant that \\"the center that had unified cybernetics disappeared, and cybernetics [would] naturally split into numerous branches.” While the old guard of cyberneticians complained, the cybernetics movement, as a whole, was exploding; with the council subsuming 170 projects and 29 institutions by 1962, and 500 projects and 150 institutions by 1967. According to Gerovitch, by the 1970s, the \\"tactical uses of cyberspeak overshadowed the original reformist goals that aspired the first Soviet cyberneticians.\\" The ideas which were once seen as controversial, and huddled under the umbrella organisation of cybernetics, now entered the scientific mainstream, leaving cybernetics as a loose and incoherent ideological patchwork. Some cyberneticians, whose dissident styles had been sheltered by the cybernetics movement, now felt themselves persecuted; cyberneticians such as Valentin Turchin, Alexander Lerner, and Igor Mel'čuk felt the need to immigrate to escape this newfound scientific atmosphere. By the 1980s, cybernetics had lost its cultural relevance, being replaced in Soviet scientific culture with the concepts of 'informatics'.

He is played by actor Adetomiwa Edun, who provided the voice and motion capture for the character. Background Alex Hunter was born in Clapham, London, and played youth football on Clapham Common with best friend Gareth Walker. Hunter is multiracial, with a white father and black mother. His life goal is to play as a professional footballer. His grandfather, Jim Hunter, was a former player who scored 22 goals in the 1968–69 season. Alex's father, Harold, was also a football player in his youth, but his career was cut short due to an injury. His mother, Catherine, works as a designer. Appearances =FIFA 17= Following a cup final game between two young teams, one of which features Hunter and his best friend, Gareth Walker, either Walker or Hunter score the winning penalty in a penalty shoot-out, a scout remarks about Alex Hunter's talent to Jim Hunter. Six years later, Hunter and Walker are invited to an exit trial for youth not yet signed to professional contracts. After a successful trial, Hunter signs for any Premier League club of the player's choosing. Hunter soon learns that Walker has joined the same club. Both players attend the club's pre-season tour of the United States, in which they play against Real Madrid, Borussia Dortmund and Paris Saint- Germain. In the regular season, after starting most games as a substitute, Hunter's club signs one of Harry Kane or Ángel Di María, and Hunter is loaned out to either Newcastle United or Aston Villa, or Norwich City. After impressing on loan in the Championship, Hunter returns to his parent club only to find that Walker has left for the club's Premier League rival. Hunter is able to receive sponsorship deals from Adidas, each deal being received whenever Hunter hits a milestone number of followers in the Twitter-based social media menu of the game mode. The deals include new boots, a photoshoot, and the chance to appear in an Adidas advertisement alongside Di María. After a successful season in the starting eleven, Hunter gets to start in the final of the FA Cup, in which he faces Gareth Walker for the first or second time since his departure from the club. Before the game, Hunter and Walker encounter each other in the tunnel. Regardless of the result, Walker and Hunter shake hands after the game and they reconcile. Later, in Hunter's flat, Hunter discovers that he has been named on a long-list of players to be called up to the England national team. =FIFA 18= Following a successful debut season, Hunter returns as a well-known professional footballer and wants to make his mark at international level. Hunter and his friend Danny Williams, who were teammates in the Championship, play against some Brazilian children in a 3v3 football game while on holiday. After returning home to England, Hunter is invited to have an interview with Rio Ferdinand. He runs into Walker, who mocks that Hunter is still with his agent, Michael. At a pre- season tour in Los Angeles, Hunter's team plays against Real Madrid; regardless of the result, Hunter swaps jerseys with Cristiano Ronaldo, who suggests that Hunter should play for Madrid. If the player beats Real Madrid, Hunter next plays against LA Galaxy, where Hunter encounters Gyasi Zardes in the tunnel before the game. Hunter also meets his father during the tour, and begrudgingly accepts an invitation to have dinner with him. After the tour, Hunter and his teammates go to Chicago where they participate in the MLS All- Star Game. Following the first game of the new Premier League season, Michael tells Hunter that Real Madrid are interested in him, and Hunter submits a transfer request. Following this news, Hunter's teammates and his fans lose faith in his commitment to the team. The day before the transfer window closes, Michael reveals that he found out that the Real Madrid deal was a scam. Despite explaining the situation to the club's executive, Hunter is moved to the youth squad. On deadline day, Michael admits that he really wanted Hunter to sign with Madrid to boost his reputation as an agent. Hunter is enraged at Michael for gambling his football career for his personal gain, and can either forgive him or fire him. Hunter then gets a call from his father, now working for LA Galaxy, who offer him a contract, which Hunter accepts. While in the U.S., Hunter learns that he has a half-sister, Kim. Though furious with his father, Hunter supports Kim during her international debut on the U.S. soccer team against Germany. Hunter returns home to England after the season with LA ends at Christmas, but gives Kim their grandfather's football for luck in her future games. After reuniting with Danny, who signed with Hunter's former club when he left, Hunter learns that Atletico Madrid, PSG, and Bayern Munich are interested in signing him. He signs to one of them and when he arrives, he finds out that Dino, the manager of his former loan club, is at his new club as well. Dino pairs Hunter up with either Thomas Muller or Antoine Griezmann, or Dele Alli, the player serving as Hunter's strike partner. However, Hunter suffers a knee injury early in the season that sidelines him for most of the season. Once recovered, Hunter finds out that Dino's job is at risk, and he may be fired if the club doesn't win any silverware by the season's end. If Hunter plays well and wins the league or domestic cup, Dino keeps his job; if not, he is fired. After the season ends, Hunter takes Jim over to the United States to meet Kim. After the meal, Hunter receives a call from an agent, offering to make him an icon. =FIFA 19= The story starts out with both Alex Hunter, his half-sister Kim and Danny Williams watching a video of Hunter's grandfather, Jim Hunter, scoring his 100th career goal for his club in a First Division match at Coventry City. After that, they train with their respective teams for the pre-season friendly tournament which is being held in Japan - ending with Alex and Danny's teams facing each other in the tournament's final. Alex later meets with Beatriz Villanova, the football agent that contacted him at the end of the previous journey - promising to make Alex an icon in world football. She keeps her promise and tells Alex that Real Madrid have offered him a 5-year contract, which he accepts and heads over to Spain to his new club. Alex is yet to make his Champions League debut and gets help from various mentors in the team to help him boost his stats. Both Alex and Danny's teams make it out of their groups in the Champions League and are drawn at opposite ends of the bracket. By this point Alex has become increasingly caught up in his brand and sponsor duties from his agents demands and the increasing fame is starting to drive a wedge between his family. This is further seen when Kim comes to visit Alex before the World Cup and Alex doesn't go to pick her up from the airport due to him being too busy with his new clothing brand, much to both Kim and his mother's dismay. Due to this, Alex is dropped from both the starting XI and substitutes before the first knockout game in the Champions League, meaning he has to fight his way back to the starting lineup to regain his manager's trust. Meanwhile, Danny is also having agent issues as his friend Ringo and his agent, Michael, have an argument over him wanting a new house or not, with the player given a choice as to which person he sides with. Nevertheless, both their teams make it to the semi-finals of the competition. Alex and Beatriz then go to visit Kim before the first knockout game and Beatriz, having been impressed by Kim's abilities, tells her that she should go pro and not go to college. Back in the Champions League, Alex faces Juventus and Danny once again face his brother's side. Both defeat their rivals and progress to the Champions League Final. In the 2019 Champions League final at the Wanda Metropolitano in Madrid where Real Madrid face Danny's Premier League side. Regardless of who wins the final, the losing character takes their defeat graciously as the other celebrates being crowned the best club team in Europe. The game ends with Jim telling Alex that he has never been prouder of him and that when he retires, he will be the greatest Hunter of all time, drawing Alex Hunter's journey to an end. =FIFA 20= Alex Hunter and Danny Williams are mentioned to have played Street Football in Rio de Janeiro in the game's Volta Football Story mode. Hunter attends the NYC Pro Street Invitational with Beatriz Villanova in New York and takes a selfie with Syd, Revvy's (the Protagonist) team mate. Reception and impact Alex Hunter's story was heavily linked with the story of Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford, who scored twice on his debut in February 2016. Rashford also gave his thoughts on the similarities between him and Alex Hunter before England's game against Iceland during Euro 2016: \\"I actually can't believe how accurate it is, watching Alex, it reminds me of my journey.\\" However, EA Sports producer Mat Prior dismissed these links, calling it \\"a case of life imitating art\\". It is not possible to customize anything about Hunter other than his team, position, and clothing, unlike FIFAs \\"Career mode\\" where users can create a player based on their own likeness. The lack of customization created minor backlash online, though research by Vocativ found most complaints about the lack of customization were not racially motivated.

Calvin (November 4, 1856 - April 9, 1936) was the only woman among Montana State College's first three professors and the first music professor. Early life Kate P. Calvin was born on November 4, 1856. Career Minnesota, North and South Dakota and Montana gazetteer and business directory Kate Calvin joined Montana State College in 1894 when the college was primarily a place where to study \\"agriculture and the mechanical arts\\". She was among the first three professors of the college; the others were Augustus M. Ryon, mining engineer who served as the founding president of Montana State University, and Frank W. Traphagen. Ryon and Traphagen were paid salaries, instead Calvin, arriving from the College of Montana, Deer Lodge, Montana, had to earn her compensation from the fees she charged for music lessons. College Exponent, 1898 In Calvin's course special attention was given to thorough technique and correct interpretation, with practical analysis of rhythm and form. Instruction in theory, analysis and history of music was free to all members of the piano department. She used Jadassohn and Emery's Harmony, and those wishing to take a complete course in piano must pass examination in harmony. Frequent recitals were given by the students for the purpose of acquiring confidence in playing at public concerts. Pupils received also special training in memorizing and sight-reading. Pupils not capable of advancement were not encouraged to continue the lessons. Nothing was more unpardonable than for a teacher to permit a pupil to continue work where success could be only partial. Such pupils spent time and money altogether in vain. No definite time was fixed for completing this course. Some made more rapid progress than others, and accomplished in four years what would take others six or eight years to finish. Students who did satisfactory work and passed the required examinations were granted diplomas. Tuition for class lessons, two lessons per week throughout the year, was $45.00 ($22.50 for one semester); for private lessons, one lesson per week throughout the year, $51.00 ($25.50 one lesson per week for one semester); Harmony for five or more students, $15.00 for the entire academic year (one lesson a week); piano rent, two periods each day, $10.00 per year. $45 in 1900 amounted to $1,239.38 in 2017. Calvin was so successful in earning her salary that by 1901 she was able to build her own house on 609 South Grand, Bozeman. Other than her own house, she built a larger house next door at 613 South Grand to serve as boarding house. Calvin retired from teaching in 1904 and continued with her real estate business. From 1899 to 1900 she took a leave of absence from the College to spend the sabbatical time in Europe. In 1922 she was treasurer of the School District 7 of the Kit Carson County, Colorado. Personal life In Bozeman, Kate Calvin lived at 609 South Grand (still standing) and owned also the Boarding House at 613. Calvin died on April 9, 1936, and is buried at Sunset Hills Cemetery, Bozeman, Montana Legacy One quad of the dormitory at Montana State College, Quad B, is named after Kate Calvin.

History At the beginning of the 20th century, after the promulgation of October Manifesto in 1905, which granted citizens of the Russian Empire freedom of conscience, the Old Believers of Novocherkassk decided to build their own church in the city. The law of 1906 on freedom of religion also eased their position. Dmitry Fedorovich Baidalakov donated his farmstead with two stone houses on Pochtovaya Street for the construction of the new church, which was completed in 1907. The interior painting was carried out by artist Ivan Fyodorovich Popov, who also took part in the painting of Novocherkassk Cathedral. Inside the church, according to contemporaries, there was a beautiful blue iconostasis. On October 26, 1908, the consecration of Old Believer church was done by the Old Believer Archbishop Ioann Kartushin, who arrived from Moscow and was assisted by Bishop Theodosius. The ceremony was also attended by state officials, including General Alexander Samsonov. After October Revolution the church was destroyed. On the very same Pochtovaya Street, at 300 meters from each other there were two St. Nicholas churches: an Orthodox one on Nikolskaya Square (now Levski Square), and an Old Believer one in the Alexander Garden. Both of them were also destroyed. File:Новочеркасск (до 07.11.1917). Церковь Покрова Пресвятой Богородицы.jpgExterior File:Новочеркасск (до 07.11.1917).

The company employs more than 3300 people worldwide in seven countries. In addition, there are individual distribution companies in more than 100 countries.  History  Schwing Concrete pump The Schwing Group was founded as a medium-sized enterprise on 17 March 1934, by Friedrich Wilhelm Schwing (* 1909; † 1992), a locksmith from Wanne-Eickel. In 1957, Schwing built the world's first oil-hydraulic two-cylinder concrete pump. Starting in 1964, the company also built the first large concrete mixers. In 1965, the company launched its first concrete pump which was mounted on a vehicle, and improved it in 1968 with the addition of a distribution mast. In 1973, the company built a high-speed concrete pump vehicle with a 45-meter-wide large distribution mast, an outstanding innovation at that time. In 1976, Schwing launched the first residual concrete processing plant on the market. After the company founder handed over the company management to his two sons in 1980, they acquired the company Stetter GmbH in Memmingen in 1982, which produced truck mixers. The company's market domicile and the company's portfolio expanded. The company was now able to offer combined mixers with a concrete pump mounted on it and developed into a market leader. At the end of the nineties there was a dispute between the owners, the company was about to sell to an American company. With the help of banks, a state guarantee and private assets, Gerhard Schwing succeeded in buying his brothers shares.

He was born at Swaffham Prior in Cambridgeshire and died at Boxworth, also in Cambridgeshire. Wilkinson was educated at Eton College and at King's College, Cambridge. He played cricket for Eton as a middle-order batsman and a bowler and appeared in the 1832 Eton v Harrow match at Lord's, when he was captain of the Eton team. It is not known whether he was right- or left-handed in either batting or bowling. At Cambridge University, he appeared in six games over three seasons that have since been designated as first-class, and was successful as a batsman. Against the Cambridge Town Club in 1833, he played an innings of 58 which was the highest of the match; against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in 1835, he opened the innings and carried his bat for an unbeaten 86 out of a total of 170. He played in the 1834 Gentlemen v Players game, but made no impact. The University Match between the cricket clubs of Oxford and Cambridge Universities was not played in the seasons that Wilkinson was in the Cambridge side. Wilkinson became a Fellow of King's College in 1836 and graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1837, which converted to a Master of Arts in 1841. In 1841 also, he was ordained in the Church of England as a deacon, becoming a priest the following year. From 1843 to 1865, he was the domestic chaplain to Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover and to his successor, George V of Hanover, the kingship of Hanover having separated from that of the United Kingdom at the death of William IV in 1837, when Queen Victoria succeeded to the UK throne. Returning to England in 1865, he was vicar of Sixhills, Lincolnshire and rector of nearby South Willingham to 1879, and then rector of Boxworth and of Childerley in Cambridgeshire to his death in 1889. He wrote a book about his experiences at the court of Hanover. Wilkinson's nephew, Edward Wilkinson, was also a first- class cricketer for Cambridge University.

Biography =Childhood= Elwart was born in Paris in the family home. At the age of ten, he became a chorister at the mastery of the Saint-Eustache church: Antoine Ponchard (a master of the chapel since 1815) ensured his first musical training. This teaching marked him for all his life, and spiritual music remained one of his great influences. Curious to discover the activity of professional musicians, he escaped from the work of manufacturer of crates where his parents had sent him and managed to become second violin in a street orchestra. In 1823, at the age of fifteen, a mass with four voices and a large orchestra of his composition was given at St-Roch Church. =Training= In 1825, the singer Cambon interpreted a scene by Elwart on the motif of the \\"Exiled\\". This year marked especially his entrance to the École royale de musique (the future Conservatoire de Paris) in counterpoint, harmony and fugue and music composition classes. His professors were François-Joseph Fétis, Jean-François Lesueur, Berlioz. Elwart was awarded the First Fugue Prize in 1830. In 1835, he performed a new Mass for Saint Cecilia. He attempted the Grand prix de Rome in 1831 with the cantata La Fuite de Bianca Capello but only won second prize. =Prix de Rome= He had to wait until 1834 to win the Grand Prix with L'Entrée en loge, a cantata composed on a text by Jean François Gail. He thus became a boarder at the Villa Medici. He left his post as a tutor for the composing class of Antoine Reicha during his stay at Villa Medici. Already known to the Parisian public, he played in France his compositions that he sent from Rome. He produced a Deuxième messe solennelle in 1835 dedicated to the Duchess of Orleans, an Italian opera and the funeral Omaggio alla memoria di Vincenzo Bellini (November 1835, Teatro Valle, Rome) in hommage to the famous opera composer who died shortly before. He presented an Ouverture on 20 October 1838, badly received by a skeptical jury and against possible innovations: the three voices of men on the second motif in E minor probably left a bitter taste. =Career at the Conservatoire= Back in Paris in 1837, he returned to the Conservatoire, but became assistant professor of Reicha, then holder of his own class created by Cherubini, the director of the Conservatoire de Paris. Elwart held the post until his retirement in 1871. Among his pupils were Louis-Aimé Maillart, , Théodore Gouvy, Jean-Baptiste Weckerlin, Émile Prudent, Olivier Métra, Edmond Hocmelle, Adolphe Blanc, Albert Gisarn, Victor Frédéric Verrimst and Oscar Comettant who described him as \\"an ingenious and witty scholar\\". It seems that he had a good relationship with his pupils, the latter ironically calling him \\"little father Elwart\\". In parallel with his classes, Antoine Elwart was a prolific composer: he wrote a Messe solennelle in 1838 for the baptism of the Comte de Paris (future pretender \\"Philippe VII\\"), and presented on 24 August. On 4 February, he had a mass played at the église St. Eustache, with Pierre- Louis Dietsch as the organist and Ambroise Thomas as the conductor. Elwart died in the 18th arrondissement of Paris. Decorations He received the Cross of Spain by Charles III. The King of Prussia decorated him with the cross of the red eagle. He was awarded the Légion d'honneur in 1873 « Cote LH/895/40 », base Léonore, ministère français de la Culture in the , a distinction to which he responded in the tone of humour: Vive la République!

The film was produced by Krishnan Sethukumar under the banner of Srivari films. The story, screenplay and dialogue of the film were written by Dr. K. Ampady. The cinematography is by Pappinu.  Synopsis  The movie tells the story of Simon (Sunny Wayne), Biju (Jacob Gregory) and Ganesh (Sarath Kumar) who are local boys bound by their love for Thalapathy Vijay. Though their parents want them to earn a living, they lead a carefree life. Arjunan Muthalali (Shammi Thilakan) and his brother Indran are petty criminals. One day, Simon and friends are returning a cutout of Vijay to a movie theater, and the cutout is hit by Indran's car, breaking its legs. In a rage, they fight with Indran and gang. Indran is admitted to hospital and Simon is arrested by SI Satyan (Baiju). Simon is soon released from custody by CI Alex (Dileesh Pothan) who is close to Simon and the gang. Simon's father constable Yesudas (Ashokan) gets a flash drive from a fully burnt body while examining it. Goons sent by Arjunan come to Yesudas' house to retrieve the drive, but Simon fights them off. Knowing the power of Arjunan, Yesudas returns the drive and asks Arjunan to spare his son and friends. To get in touch with Deepa (Prayaga Martin) Simon takes Ganesh's daughter Jennifer to Deepa's dance class. One day Simon drops Janaki off in front of her house after class. Ganesh informs Simon that his daughter is missing. Simon searches for her. He finds out that a racket abducts children and uses them for begging. A man from the gang is brought to his house and Simon interrogates him. Meanwhile, Jennifer is released by the gang and is admitted to the hospital. Simon learns Arjunan is behind the racket and that some children are used in the organ trade. It is revealed that the burnt body was of doctor Jomon, who had discovered the illegal activities in Arjunan's hospital and placed the details on the flash drive. They burned his body to destroy all evidence related to the crime. Biju had taken the copy of the contents in the flash drive hoping for a pornographic film. The drive instead contained details of Arjunan's racket. Simon and friends with CI Alex and Prof. Seetharaman (Nedumudi Venu) meet Arjunan and his gang at their hideout. It is revealed by then Alex was Arjunan's partner in crime. Alex's intention was to garner local support for the upcoming election without any expense. Hence, he befriended Thalapathy fans and joined forces with Arjunan. But the man from the beggar gang already told Simon about Alex's involvement. The Thalapathy fans fight the villains. Alex and Arjunan and his gang are sent to jail. Alex explains how he ended up in jail to his inmates Jude Anthany Joseph and Sudhi Koppa. Simon has become a police constable and the last scene shows that he and Deepa together watching a film acted by Thalapathy Vijay.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. The house is currently operated by the Branch County Historical Society as the Wing House Museum. History Albert Chandler was a prominent and successful businessman in Coldwater. He founded the Coldwater Sentinel in 1841, and owned a hardware business; he was also Coldwater's first mayor, serving three terms. Albert's son Jay Chandler was a tinner, likely for his father's business. In 1875, Chandler married New Yorker Frances Campbell. Campbell was fearful of living in the then-wild Coldwater area, and it is said that, to ease the transition, her father helped build a replica of his own house in Coldwater for the newly married couple. However, the Chandler's marriage was apparently not successful. In 1882, Chandler sold the house to Lucius M. Wing, and Frances Chandler moved back to New York. Jay Chandler died in 1884. (note: large pdf file) Lucius M. Wing was another prominent citizen of Coldwater. He was born in 1840 and worked on his father's farm and brickyard. In 1861, he began farming on his own, and in 1862 enlisted as a private in the 19th Michigan Volunteer Infantry Regiment. He was soon promoted to Lieutenant and later commissioned as a Captain. At the end of the Civil War, Wing returned to farming, and was then elected sheriff, at which time he moved to Coldwater. In 1868 Wing married Adeline M. Knapp. Both Lucius and Adeline Wing were social and political leaders in late 18th century Coldwater. The Wings lived in the house until their deaths; Adeline in 1912 and Lucius in 1921. After Lucius's death, the house passed to his son S. L. Wing, and he and his wife Beniti and their daughter Adaline lived there. The house was purchased by the Branch County Historical Society in the early 1970s.

The idea for the cocktail started with a spherical glass that Kick owned. In a 2016 interview with Forbes, Kick described her difficulties raising money for her business, stating that she was told that she was unlikely to survive in a male-dominated industry. She said she \\"wouldn’t label [herself] as a feminist because [she] loves guys\\" and that women have \\"special skills that men don’t\\".

The Celtic cross in the centre is part of the monument at the site of the explosion in Louth. The Edentubber Martyrs were five Irish republicans killed on 11 November 1957 during a premature landmine explosion in Edentubber, County Louth, Ireland. According to Tim Pat Coogan it was the “single biggest disaster of the whole campaign”. During the Border Campaign, four IRA men were preparing a landmine in a cottage on the side of a hill overlooking the border. The cottage was owned by fifty five year old civilian, Michael Watters, who had allowed them to use his cottage for their operation. The four IRA members were Oliver Craven, Paul Smith, George Keegan and Patrick Parle. The likely cause of the detonation was a malfunction with the timing mechanism, and all five were killed instantly. It was the biggest loss to the IRA since the Irish civil war. Garda Síochána found three Thompson sub-machine guns and magazines at the scene. They are commemorated annually by Sinn Féin and Republican Sinn Féin. Prior to the explosion IRA member Robert Kehoe visited the cottage and told Paul Smith that he thought that the alarm clocks should not be used, but their concerns were dismissed. He said that as they left Paddy Pearle was singing “Erin my own lovely land”.

It was formed mainly by black activists in the Labour Party (UK).Keith Popple (1997), \\"Understanding and tackling racism among young people in Britain' in Keith Popple, Jan Laurens Hazekam, eds, Racism in Europe: A Challenge for Youth Policy and Youth Work, London: UCL Press, p. 21. Context and formation In the early 1990s, the far-right, in particular the British National Party (BNP), was resurgent both electorally and in terms of racial attacks (from 4,383 in 1988 to 7,780 three years later).The Guardian, 20 February 1993. Anti-Fascist Action, the longest established national anti- fascist organisation in the UK at that time, organised well-attended events in October 1991 - a Unity Carnival in East London attracting 10,000 people and a march through Bethnal Green attracting 4,000 people - prompting other left- wing groups to launch anti-racist and anti-fascist organisations, including ARA in November and the re-launch of the Anti-Nazi League (ANL) by the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) two months later.Popple (1997), \\"Understanding and Tackling Racism Among Young People in Britain\\" in Popple, Hazekam, eds, Racism in Europe, p. 20. The ARA was formed by Marc Wadsworth, previously active in Labour Party Black Sections. It was the first Black-led, broad-based coalition campaigning to stem the rising tide of racism, antisemitism and support for the extreme right. The ARA was supported by more than 800 organisations including many national Black and Jewish organisations. It also had the support of more than 90 MPs and MEPs from across the political spectrum as well as thousands of individuals. The ARA organised campaigns locally and nationally against racist murders, attacks and harassment [http://www.bishopsgate.org.uk/Library/Special-Collections-and- Archives/Protest-and-Campaigning/Anti-Racist-Alliance and rented offices in Lloyd Baker Street at Clerkenwell, London, from Islington council. It won the support of powerful trade unions such as the Transport and General Workers Union.Andrew Hosken, Ken: The Ups and Downs of Ken Livingstone, Arcadia Books, 10 April 2008: Chapter 18: 1985–1994. Ken and the Rise of Socialist Action, p. 265. Its formation was endorsed by the Jewish Socialist Group, the Indian Workers Association and the Black Liaison Group. Marc Wadsworth spoke with John Ross, among others he had worked with on the left, for Socialist Action's support for the new campaign and Ross suggested appointing the left-wing London Labour MP Ken Livingstone as co-chair of the ARA. Wadsworth proposed Cardinal Basil Hume's race advisor Leela Ramdeen as the other co-chair, to engage Black faith groups. A number of Socialist Action members were put on the executive committee because of their campaigning abilities, including Redmond O'Neill and others later appointed advisers to Livingstone when he was Mayor of London.Hosken (2008), Ken: The Ups and Downs of Ken Livingstone, Chapter 18: 1985–1994. Ken and the Rise of Socialist Action, p. 267.Marc Wadsworth 'Militant' Political Plotters Who Run City Hall, The-Latest, 19 January 2008. Anne Kane of Socialist Action was full-time assistant secretary, but was later fired for gross misconduct. Its vice-chair was Lee Jasper. The ARA managed to achieve a broad-based coalition of support from across the left, trade unions and anti-racist organisations, although the anti-fascist magazine Searchlight denounced elements in the ARA leadership [Lee Jasper, its vice-chair] for having links with the antisemite Louis Farrakhan.Paul Anderson \\"Anti-Racists at Odds\\" New Statesman & Society, 15 October 1993. Development and dissolution Wadsworth and the ARA played a considerable role in the campaign for justice in the wake of the murder of Stephen Lawrence, a black teenager. It organised a peaceful anti-racist demonstration of 3,500 people in Central London on 16 October 1993, the same day the ANL organised a rival, larger and more militant demonstration in Welling, near to the scene of the murder. The rivalry between anti-racist organisations soon alienated the Lawrence family: Doreen Lawrence later wrote that \\"the various groups that had taken an interest in Stephen's death were tearing each other apart and were in danger of destroying our campaign, which we wanted to keep focused and dignified\\". Doreen and Neville Lawrence wrote to both the ANL and the ARA to demand that they \\"stop using Stephen's name\\".Doreen Lawrence, And Still I Rise: Seeking Justice for Stephen, Faber and Faber, 2006, p. ii7. In 1994 the ARA organised a TUC-sponsored \\"Unite Against Racism\\" march, attended by 50,000 people.Barberis. By 1993 there was considerable tension within the ARA between Wadsworth and Ken Livingstone. On 23 September 1994 the ARA issued a statement claiming that \\"Ken Livingstone, supported by a faction called Socialist Action and a handful of unprincipled and unrepresentative members of the executive committee, has been waging a relentless campaign to sack [Wadsworth] the national secretary.\\"The Guardian, 24 September 1994. On 30 September 1994 Livingstone went to the High Court to determine voting rights for the delegates to the ARA's forthcoming annual meeting and an out-of-court settlement was reached. In October 1994 both Livingstone and Wadsworth stepped down. Wadsworth gave way to Kumar Murshid, a future Livingstone mayoral adviser on race. Murshid walked away from the job after turning up at the ARA's offices to find that Wadsworth's staff had changed the locks for security reasons. The ARA collapsed rapidly after unions, including the Transport and General Workers Union, withdrew support.Hosken (2008), Ken: The Ups and Downs of Ken Livingstone, Chapter 18: 1985–1994. Ken and the Rise of Socialist Action, pp. 267–8. By February 1995 the breakaway National Assembly Against Racism (NAAR), had been established, largely by three members of Socialist Action, O'Neill, Jude Woodward and Anne Kane. Lee Jasper, who became Livingstone's senior mayoral policy adviser on equalities, was its first secretary. Approach The ARA claimed to be the only black-led anti-racist movement in the UK. It argued that black self-organisation and labour movement support were the key factors in combating racism in the UK. Its strategy was to focus on making a case for more robust legislation against racial harassment and racist literature.Popple (1997), \\"Understanding and Tackling Racism Among Young People in Britain' in Popple, Hazekam, eds, Racism in Europe, p. 22.* In this approach it contrasted with its main rival, the ANL, which prioritised the fight against fascism rather than state racism.Barberis.

The original portion of the district, running along Chicago Street from Wright Street to Division Street, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Two boundary increases were added in 1990, one running roughly along Pearl Street between Hudson and Lincoln Streets, and the other roughly along Church Street from Jefferson to Daugherty Streets, along with the block of Park Place north of Church and the block of Hull Street west of Park Place. History Coldwater grew up around the Chicago Road, which was established in 1825. By the 1830s, thousands of families were using the road to move west. Coldwater was established as a village in 1837, as the county seat in 1842, and as a city in 1861. (note: large pdf file) The Michigan Southern Railway built a line through the southern portion of the city in 1850, spurring development on the south side of the Chicago Road. The lots in the southern portion of the district, along Pearl Street, were substantially filled by 1870. (note: large pdf file) By 1870, development had spread east along the Chicago Road to Morse Street. Coldwater as a whole, and the East Chicago Street Historic District, grew rapidly though the remainder of the 19th century. The area east of Morse Street was completely unplatted in 1872, but had been entirely platted by 1902. (note: large pdf file) One of the most significant buildings in the district is the Coldwater Public Library at 12 E. Chicago. In 1869, the Ladies Library Association was formed to start a local library. By 1870, the Association had collected 1200 volumes, and started a library in the house of Dr. John Beech (across the street at 11 E. Chicago). By 1880, the library was flourishing and the Coldwater City Council adopted a resolution providing for the establishment of a city library. A site was procured, but it wasn't until 1885 that a successful businessman, Edwin R. Clarke (whose house is located at 299 E. Chicago Street), donated funds to construct a building. The library opened in 1886. The first President of the Library Board Henry C. Lewis, who live at 53 E. Chicago. Lewis was an art collector, and constructed a gallery near his house at 45. E Chicago, which is now a portion of the Masonic Temple. Description The East Chicago Street Historic District contains 72 structures within the original district along East Chicago. These structures include 42 residences and 19 businesses, along with a church, a library, a funeral home, a fraternal lodge, six medical buildings, and a hospital. The additional section added in 1990 contain 53 contributing houses and seven outbuildings on the north side addition, and a further 29 contributing houses in the south addition.

The work has been lost, but having been substantially quoted by Augustine in his De Civitate Dei (published AD 426) its contents can be reconstructed in parts. To a lesser extent, quotes from the work have also been transmitted by other authors, including (among others) Pliny (1st c.), Gellius (2nd c.), Censorinus (3rd c.), Servius (4th/5th c.), Nonius (4th/5th c.), Macrobius (5th c.), Priscian (5th/6th c.). The work was divided into 41 books (libri), of which the first 25 were dealing with Res humanae (\\"human affairs\\") and the remaining 16 with Res divinae (\\"divine affairs\\"). It was above all an account of the cultural and institutional history of Rome and the Roman religion. It was written in the 50s or 40s BC.It was published before 46 BC, when it is mentioned by Cicero, and after the ban on the Egyptian cults in 58/59 BC. Ottavo Contributo Alla Storia Degli Studi Classici E Del Mondo Antico (1987), p. 269. T. P. Wiseman, Remembering the Roman People: Essays on Late-Republican Politics and Literature (2008), p. 115 In Res divinae, Varro introduced the division of divinity into three parts, into mythical theology, natural theology and civil theology. The concept of \\"natural theology\\" in particular has become influential via the transmission by Augustine. The topical division of Res divinae into 16 books has been preserved. Books 1-4 were dedicated to priesthood (de hominibus), 5-7 to cult sites (de locis), 8-10 to the religious calendar of festivals (de temporibus), 11-13 to ritual (de sacris), and 14-16 to the gods (de dis), especially discussing the etymology of their names. The work is based on Stoic sources. Varro refutes the poetic or \\"mythical theology\\" as popular superstition, complaining that the pure veneration of the divine had been spoiled by the influence of the poets, but he considers valuable the philosophical debate on the nature of the gods.Wolfgang Speyer, Frühes Christentum im antiken Strahlungsfeld (1989), 416–419. Varro presents the Roman king Numa Pompilius as a paragon of ancient piety. Numa was associated with Pythagoreanism, even though Varro granted that Numa could not have been a Pythagorean since he lived before Pythagoras himself.Markus Peglau, \\"Varro und die angeblichen Schriften des Numa Pompilius\\" in: Andreas Haltenhoff, Fritz-Heiner Mutschler (eds.), Hortus litterarum antiquarum (2000), 441–450.

The school was established in 1898 by Fr: Pierre Boulic.About St'Aloysius National College,Ratnapura,Sri Lanka St. Aloysius' College is a National School and the largest boys' school in Sabaragamuwa. It provides primary and secondary education. College Building College Ground  History  St. Aloysius' College has a long history which is about more than 120 years. Rev.Father Pierre Boulic came to the Ratnapura St.Padrew & Paul's Church on December 03, 1886 and he was the in-charge father of missionary duties in the St. Padrew and Paul's Church. He found for the whole Sabaragamuwa province there was no Sinhala or Tamil school for the Catholic children. So he decided to start a new school in Ratnapura. He determined to open a school but the main problem was a place. There was only of space in the church premises and the church was surrounded by large rocks. At last a cooly came from Balangoda blasted all the rocks and used them to built the walls of the new school. Don Martinus Abeyratne supplied materials for the roof. Other expenses were supplied by Catholics and Father Boulic. This Anglo-vernacular school was opened in the month of June 1888 by Rev. Father Pierre Boulic. The school was named as St. Peter's School which was a mixed one. English and Sinhala were taught in the school. On the opening day 40 students were presented. There were four teachers. John Perera and Father S. J. Perera taught to the boys and two other lady teachers (neither of which were certificated teachers) taught to the girls. John Perera was a reporter at the \\"Times of Ceylon\\" and at that time was residing in Ratnapura. He kindly offered his service to the school and taught in the school since 1888 till 1890. St. Peter's School commenced 1888 and it ceased to function in 1893. In 1898 Father S. S. Peter Wallyn arrived to Ratnapura and he heard about the 'defunct' Anglo-vernacular school which had been opened by Father Boulic. Father Wallyn decided to re-open the school and established an English middle school, Peter and Paul's Mixed School. There were 24 students at the opening day. In 1899 Father Wallyn moved to Balangoda. In October 1899 Father A. Closset became the second manager of St.Peter and Paul's School. He registered the school as an Assisted English School for boys and girls. The land on which the school stands today was donated to Father Closset by Mr. Grero. In 1900 the name of Peter and Paul's School was changed to St. Aloysius' English School for girls and boys. There after in 1901-1904 period Rev. Father A. Stache was appointed as the third manager of St. Aloysius' English School. During this period the hostel of the college was built on the property of a gentleman called Dr.Oliveux who sold the property to Rev Father J. Van Reeth, the first Bishop of Galle. During Father A. S tache's period the first prize distribution was took place. It was held on 21 December 1902 and the Government Agent, G. S. Saxton presided the occasion. A drama which was named as \\"The Invisible Hand\\" staged for this occasion. Stache served as the manager of the school until 1904. In 1904, Stache left and Rev. Father Francis De Hert took his place as the fourth manager of the college. In 1907 P. S. M. Perera was appointed as the head master of the college. Perera served as the head master for 34 years. During his period W. K. Stephen Jayasekara, P. D. Vincent, Mrs. Rodrigoo, Joyachim, Gnanapragasam, Rodrigoo served as teachers. De Hert worked as the manager of college until 1909. Rev. Father Peter Wallyn, the founder of the school returned to Ratnapura from Balangoda on 19 January 1910 and assumed duties as the fifth manager of the school. In this period the annual celebration of Old Boys Association was held in grand level. There were some priests to help Father Wallyn. Two of them were Rev. Father E. Gaspard and Rev. Father C. Louwers who started the boarding house at the school. Wallyn died whilst on a holiday in Nuwara-Eliya on 22 November 1922. After the death of Wallyn Rev. Father L. Spillbout became the sixth manager of the Aloysius' School. Under his management many improvements were took place. He built a part of the present college building (Ground Floor) and named Wallyn Memorial Hall to respect the founder of the school Father Wallyn. He also responsible for the erection of two-story college hostel which can accommodate about 100 boarders. During his period the first inter-school champion trophy which was organized by the government agent on the occasion of his majesty's birthday won by St. Aloysius and this win continued for eleven years. The opening of Convent of Child Jesus and transferring the girls to the new institute were also took place. Spillbout changed the school colours from green and gold to blue and silver and the school motto which was \\"Union is the Strength\\" to \\"Age Quod Agis\\" during this period. The Governor of Sri Lanka Sir Herbert Stanley also visited the school and spoke very highly about the school and the staff, the discipline and the smart of the students of the school. Spillbout left the school in December 1929 to Kegalle and Rev. Father N. M. Lodadio became the seventh manager. He understood the students' accommodation problem and converted school into two-story building as a solution and included a library for use of the teachers. Lodadio was elevated to Bishop of Galle on 28 May 1934 and left the school on 15 July 1934. On 29 June 1934 Rev. Father L. Melpingnano was appointed as the eighth Manager of St. Aloysius' College. During Melpignano's tenure, he provided the physics and chemistry laboratories for the students and also broadened the playground and extended the college buildings. In 1946 the magnificent Gem-Lit Night Carnival was held. It was the first night carnival in Ratnapura and again the second night carnival held in August 1948 which was named as Jubilee Pageant.

Between 1966 and 1968 he served as the West German ambassador to the Holy See.  Life  = Provenance and family connections = Dieter Sattler was born in Munich, the second of his parents' four children. His father was the architect Carl Sattler (1877-1966). His paternal grandfather, Ernst Sattler (1840-1923), was a painter. His mother was born Eva Hildebrand. His maternal grandfather was the sculptor Adolf von Hildebrand (1847-1921). There had been close links between the Sattler and Hildebrand families since at least as far back as 1848. In 1933 Dieter Sattler married Maria Clara Schiedges (1910–1973).Ingrid Metzger-Buddenberg: Carl Jacob Burckhardt, S. Fischer 1986, p. 640 They met at a Theology seminar. She came originally from Düsseldorf. That marriage resulted in six recorded children. These included Birgit Albrecht who worked as a librarian, Monika Schätz, a book dealer, Christoph Sattler (born 1938), a Munich-based architect, Florian Sattler, a Communications Chief for the city of Munich, Martin Sattler, a Law Professor Emeritus at Heidelberg and Stephan Sattler (born 1947), a prominent arts journalist. Dieter Sattler was also father-in-law to the historian Dieter Albrecht (1927-1999). = Early years = Both Dieter Sattler's parents had been born in Florence where their own parents spent time as members of the expatriate artistic community. Dieter Sattler spent several months each year in Florence while a small child, but this routine came to an end in 1914, the year war broke out, and in 1915 he started to attend his secondary school in Munich. His parents separated in 1921. The children remained with their mother whose conversion to Roman Catholicism, (after growing up with parents who \\"had no Christian faith\\") had been a reason for the break-up. He passed his School Final Exams (Abitur) at the city's prestigious Wilhelmsgymnasium (secondary school) in 1924. Dieter Sattler himself would convert to Catholicism only in 1932, his decision to do so influenced both by the woman who shortly afterwards became his wife and by his intellectually formidable maternal uncle, Dietrich von Hildebrand (1889-1977), whose own conversion to Catholicism had taken place in 1914. He attended the Technical University of Munich between 1924 and 1929, studying Architecture and later also Economics. He received his first degree in 1929 and a doctorate of engineering (Dr. Ing) in 1931. His dissertation topic was the sculptor (and his own grandfather) Adolf von Hildebrand. It was his intention to progress to a habilitation (higher academic degree) which would have opened the way to a lifelong university career, but after 1933 this option was blocked to him. One source states that he worked as a freelance architect in Munich and then in Berlin between 1929 and 1939, with a particular focus on residential development projects. Elsewhere it is stated that he began to work as an architect in Munich only in 1932. Either way, after receiving his doctorate in 1931 it seems that he found time for several lengthy visits abroad, becoming fluent (where he was not already) in English, French and Italian. = Nazi Germany = Dietrich von Hildebrand's influence extended beyond the narrow issue of a religious denomination. Sattler also came to share his uncle's hostility to the Nazi party which took power in January 1933 and spent the next few months transforming the country into a one-party dictatorship. Dieter Sattler's marriage to Maria Clara Schiedges took place on 19 May 1933 in Salzburg, at that stage still just across the border from Nazi Germany, in Austria. In 1932 Sattler had acquired a property at Grendach near Taching am See, close to Salzburg but on the German side of the frontier. The region was far off the beaten track, but his brother, the landscape painter Berhard Sattler, already lived in an adjacent hamlet. Bernhard had \\"discovered\\" the region which he valued for its visual and artistic beauty. Dieter Sattler caused a seemingly unprecedented surge in employment opportunities for the small holders in the village by having the former cowshed on his property converted into a family home. At this stage, however, after the marriage the Sattler couple (soon a young family) settled in Berlin where Sattler still hoped to continue with his studies and obtain a habilitation (higher degree). He was supervised for his studies by a professor who shortly after this had his teaching permit withdrawn because, according to the authorities, he was Jewish. After this Sattler found his will to join the nation's academic establishment had disappeared. Nevertheless, while pursuing his career as an architect he continued to take an active interest in other matters. For example, there were still lengthy trips abroad, and he organised at least one concert tour by the brilliant (and already world-famous) Russian pianist, Vladimir Horowitz. During the twelve Nazi years Sattler made no secret of his dislike for the régime, retaining his belief in Catholic Conservatism and sustaining loose links with more active Christian opponents of Nazism. But he never himself participated in opposition activism (which would have been illegal), he was never identified as Jewish and he was clearly not a communist. Unlike his more outspoken uncle he never found it necessary permanently to escape from Germany. At the same time, sources hint that he received few architectural commissions at his Berlin office, and spent the later 1930s keeping out of the way at his Grendach property near Taching am See. In 1940 he was conscripted into the army: that summer he participated in the invasion of France. After eight months in the army in France, in December 1940 he was taken off the frontline and switched to an \\"emergency\\" building project involving Linz. The Linz scheme was particularly dear to the leader's heart. Sattler was assigned to it for most of the rest of the war. A personal benefit was that he was far closer to Grendach where his wife and children were based permanently after 1943 when the family's Munich apartment was bombed out. = Reconstruction years = Military defeat left the western two thirds of Germany divided into four large military occupation zones after May 1945. Upper Bavaria was part of the US zone. The military administrators were on the look out for German professionals untainted by a Nazi past to make a start on rebuilding civil administration and society. Sattler was mandated to oversee the rebuilding/restoration the \\"party buildings\\" (as they had been designated during the Nazi period) in Munich's Königsplatz (\\"Royal square\\"). This turned out to be the first step in a political career for Sattler. He impressed the occupiers with his expertise and focus. He was also \\"noticed\\" by Hans Ehard, the man who became Bavarian Minister-president at the end of 1946, who commended the judicious objectivity of his judgement, able to be well-informed and quietly critical without becoming engaged in politics. Nevertheless, from now on Sattler did become involved with the emerging mainstream establishment, both politically and in terms of his architecture business which, inevitably, stood to benefit from the massive amount of reconstruction made necessary by the destruction of the war. Sattler contributed in various ways to the reconstruction effort. He became a member of the City Housing Commission (\\"Wohnungsausschuß\\"). He was a co-instigator of the Provisional Arts and Culture Commission for the City of Munich\\" (\\"Vorläufigen Kunstausschuß der Stadt München\\"). He founded the Munich Professional Association for Architects and Construction Engineers (\\"Berufsverband für Architekten und Bauingenieure Münchens\\"), becoming its first president. He also, in 1946, joined the Christian Social Union in Bavaria, a political party of the conservative centre which sought to recapture the Catholic moral and political values of the pre-Nazi period for a more assertively (non-Prussian) Bavarian future. Sources stress, however, that he shunned the more partisan manifestations of the more high-profile CSU leaders of the time. As a member of the Regional Party Executive (Landesvorstand) between 1947 and 1951 he remained in the background. Sattler's relatively low political profile was one of the qualities that commended him to Franz Josef Strauss, a leading member of the party's Müller wing. Strauss enthusiastically endorsed Sattler's appointment in 1947 as Bavarian secretary of state, which effectively meant working as deputy to another \\"Müller man\\", Alois Hundhammer, the Bavarian Culture Minister. The scope of the ministry also covered education. If Sattler belonged to any faction within the CSU, it was not the party's Müller wing, but he was in any case more interested in practical work. He had not campaigned for the appointment. Nevertheless, he did bring political balance and valuable abilities to his political role, representing the extreme south of Bavaria, with an approach deeply rooted in Catholicism and appreciation of the arts. At 41 he was considered relatively young. He was unencumbered by any skeletons from the Nazi years and, like the military administrators who, especially before May 1949, took a close and detailed interest in developments, Sattler had mastered English. In this capacity Sattler served as a member of the Ehard government during 1946/47 and again in the successor administration which served till the end of 1950. Within the cabinet his responsibilities covered the \\"fine arts\\": he was appointed \\"Staatssekretär für Schöne Künste\\" on 31 January 1947. During his time as a member of the Bavarian government he was closely involved in the establishment, in 1948, of the Bavarian Fine Arts Academy (\\"Bayerische Akademie der Schönen Künste\\") and of the Bavarian Institute for Art History (\\"Zentralinstitut für Kunstgeschichte\\"). In 1948 Sattler also succeeded in having a teaching chair created at Munich University for Romano Guardini, a noted Roman Catholic intellectual and, by this stage, also a family friend and frequent visitor at the Sattlers' home. The teaching chair at Munich effectively replaced the teaching chair at Berlin University from which National Socialists had forced Guardini to resign back in 1939. Having planted the idea already in 1945, Sattler was from the beginnings in 1947 up to its final establishment in 1950, the main driving force behind the establishment of the Munich-based Institute for Contemporary History, the first German institute of its kind and still one of the most important academic institutions committed to research on Nazi Germany. After the election at the end of 1950 Dieter Sattler and his minister, Alois Hundhammer were both replaced in the government. This may in part have been connected with the fact that Sattler had served as what amounted to an \\"under-minister\\" despite never actually having been elected a member of the Bavarian regional parliament (\\"Landtag\\"), or it may simply have reflected the shifting power balance within the party. Between 1950 and 1952 Sattler served as president of the German Theatre Association (\\"Deutscher Bühnenverein\\"). He also served during 1951/52 as chair of the broadcasting council at Bayerischer Rundfunk, the Bavarian broadcasting company. By this time, following the dramatic events in and above Berlin during 1948/49, Germany's American, British and French military occupation zones (but, conspicuously, not the Soviet occupation zone) had been combined in May 1949 and relaunched as the US-sponsored German Federal Republic (West Germany). = Diplomacy = Dieter Sattler found further uses for his experience of government service in July 1952, the month in which he was sent to Rome as a cultural attaché by the recently formed West German government. He remained in Rome till 1959. During his first few years much of his time was spent negotiating the return of the assets from the German Culture and Scientific Institute which had been confiscated by the Allied Armies during the war. One of his projects, which later became a model for German cultural institutions overseas, was the German Library in Rome. Meanwhile, in 1955 Bonn–Paris conventions, following several years of Anglo-French wrangling, were ratified and came into force in 1955, providing that West Germany should from that point acquire \\"the full authority of a sovereign State over its internal and external affairs\\". Most of the longer established members of the diplomatic community came with career histories that meant their contributions were no longer required by the West German diplomatic service. Sattler's own record seems not to have embarrassed anyone, however, his obdurate adherence to his Roman Catholic principals having effectively inoculated him against any involvement with the Nazi régime. In 1959 he was recalled to Bonn, seat of the West German government, and appointed \\"Ministerialdirektor\\" and head of the Cultural Department at the Foreign Ministry. As the political tensions between East and West Germany spilled over into the cultural sphere, his seven years in the office coincided with a period of significant \\"soft power\\" investment. On Sattler's initiative the Goethe Institute gradually took over all of the German cultural institutes abroad that fell within the ambit of the West German government. Sattler's objective was to anchor activities of the culturally focused German overseas institutions more firmly within the country's overall foreign policy strategy, which in some ways reflected his own life and career, using diplomatic instincts and personal panache to bring together the worlds of the arts and of politics. In October 1966 Dieter Sattler took up his appointment, which had been announced seven months earlier, as West German ambassador to the Holy See, a position for which his previous career made him, in the opinion of one commentator, the \\"ideal candidate\\". His term was cut short by his death at Rome in November 1968, caused by a nerve infection.

Vance Phillips, A woman of the century Luella J. Vance Phillips (born 1858, died before 1951) was an American china-painting artist and one of the founders of the Pi Beta Phi fraternity at Hastings College. Early life Luella \\"Lou\\" J. Vance was born in a country home in Vernon County, Wisconsin, in 1858, the last child of Sampson Anderson Vance (1833-1864) and Jane McMahon, who later remarried to Captain William Horlocker. She was fourteen years old, when she saw clearly the path marked out for her to follow. At the age of ten years she had shown extraordinary ability in drawing and was looked upon by her teachers as a child of talent. Thrown on her own resources at the age of fourteen, she not only supported herself, but, without other aid than her own courageous and determined spirit, she succeeded in obtaining a good education in the art to which she was devoted, as well as in other branches. Career Hand Painted Porcelain Plaque of Mary and Baby Jesus, dated 1913 Phillips studied under the best teachers in Chicago, Cincinnati and New York. Limited always to her own earnings, she progressed steadily and won an enviable fame. Not only in the State of Nebraska, but in the art centers of the country, her work received high praise, and the art magazines did her honor in their reviews of the Chicago yearly exhibits. In china-decorating, her specialty, she excelled, and also in figure-painting. Nebraska probably owes as much to her as to any one person for the present high plane art attained within its borders. The Pi Beta Phi fraternity at Hastings College was founded on November 17, 1887, as Nebraska Beta by Luella Vance Phillips, Maud C. Harrison, Flora S. Bowman McCloud, Flora Blackburn Lamson, Lillie Selby Moor. The charter members were: Leta Horlocker (Phillips's sister), Luella Vance Phillips, Adeline Shedd, Freda Elizabeth Wahlquist Zacharias. Phillips was one of the initial 10 teachers. In 1890 Phillips, then living at Grand Island, won a gold medal for the best china painting at the Western Art Association meeting in Omaha. She won it again in 1891, at the time living in Kearney. In 1893 Phillips was in Chicago for the World's Columbian Exposition, where she had a studio for China painting, and she decided to remain in Chicago after the fair closed. In 1896 she published Book of the China Painter: A complete guide for the keramic decorator. It was the first of a series of art amateur handbooks published by Montague Marks of New York City. Experienced teachers contributed to the volume articles on special branches of the art, and the book contained full instructions for glass painting. It was illustrated with 150 black and white drawings on the text, and six colored plates, and the cost was $3. In 1899 Phillips was elected chairman of education at the Chicago convention of the Miniature Painters Association. In June 1899 she worked with Laura Overly in her studio on Penn Avenue, Pittsburgh. While there, Phillips held an exhibition of her work. Beginning of the 1900s, Phillips was in New York City working as Elocution, Voice Culture, Physical Culture trainer with a studio in the Carnegie Hall. She was a lecturer on Methods of Improving Articulation. Through the 1900s and the 1910s she also continued with art lessons, giving lectures on Colors, showing charts and masks disclosing color schemes. The charts were a key to a practical use of color. Phillips also taught at Chautauqua Lake Summer School. In 1911 she taught at the Duquesne Ceramic Club. Personal life Phillips resided, Hastings, Grand Island, Kearney and Omaha, Nebraska. Her sister Leta died in 1951, and at the time, Phillips was already dead.

It is housed in Can Quintana, a 16th-century building. It is dedicated to the knowledge and communication of the Mediterranean Sea and uses the natural sounds, human sounds and music to show the reality of the land, the history and the culture of the village of Torroella, connected with the others Mediterranean cultures and towns. It pretends to become a site to think about the nearest territory and the main issues that affect the different Mediterranean nations. It is also an Interpretation Centre of the Natural Park of Montgrí, Medes Islands and Lower Ter. Besides, it hosts the Documentation Centre of Montgrí, Medes Islands and Lower Ter and the Academic Chair of Littoral Mediterranean Ecosystems. The Museum of the Mediterranean  History of the museum  The Museum of the Mediterranean was the descendant of Museum of Montgrí and Lower Ter, known as the Museum of Montgrí, founded at the early 1980s. This old museum was located in Casa Pastors, an ancient building of the town and it used to collect and communicate the multiple cultural and natural heritage of the town and surrounding territory. The moving to the building of Can Quintana, in May 2003, it was the opportunity to modernize the exhibitions and topics, now focused into Mediterranean natural and cultural heritage. This museum is part of the Territorial Network of Museums of the Counties of Girona, the Network of Museums of the Costa Brava, the Network of Maritime Museums of the Catalan Coast and the Network of Museums of Ethnology of Catalonia. It is also part of the Observatory of the Ethnological and Immaterial Heritage.  The historical building of Can Quintana  Can Quintana is an historical building of the village. It is and old masia, atypically located inside the town walls, that has been cataloged between the late 16th century and the early 17th century. It has a ground floor -adapted as a reception, temporary exhibitions, classrooms and auditorium-, a floor -where there is located the permanent exhibition-, and an attic -occupied by the offices and Documentation Center-, as well, there is a courtyard on the back of the building. At the beginning of the 20th century (1907–1908), the interiors of the house were decorated by Rafael Masó. Of his activity, we can appreciate the wooden ceiling or the outdoors stairway. The building also has other ornamental elements such as the pictorial remains and some noble rooms, located in the first floor. The house was the ancient residence of the Quintana family, a wealthy owners and traders of oil and wine. Actually, on the ground floor, it is possible to see an oil mill that has an inscription from 1703. The most notable head of family was Albert Quintana i Combis, a liberal politician of the Catalan Renaixença (a 19TH century Catalan nationalism wave) He held different positions in the Spanish Administration, such as head of Huesca province, Spanish legislator and senator, and secretary and intendent in the island of Cuba. He also was a poet and he called himself as El Cantor del Ter (The Singer of Ter). On the opposite of the garden of Can Quintana there is the Pere Blasi Municipal Library, becoming Can Quintana as an important cultural center of the town. In this way, this building hosts concerts and other public activities with relative frequency.

The station, near the town of Embudo along the Rio Grande in northern New Mexico, was used to develop tools and techniques for measuring stream flow in the arid, western United States.  History  The Embudo Stream Gauging Station was established as part of the United States Geologic Survey Irrigation Survey, a project to map water basins and collect streamflow data in an effort to make informed irrigation infrastructure decisions, directed by Clarence Dutton. While Dutton was able to locate topographers and irrigation engineers for the survey, he was not able to locate hydrographers, so a training camp was established at Embudo, New Mexico. Engineers, including camp director Frederick H.Newell, first arrived in December 1888. While canvas tents and cots were purchased, the unanticipated cold of the higher elevation site led to the use of shallow trenches with blankets rather than cots and small cave dug in a nearby hillside for sleeping. By early March 1889, the camp hosted 21 residents, including 15 students. The training period ended in April 1889 with ten of the students taking on hydrographer positions in the Irrigation Survey. Stream measurements were continued by the local railroad agent until 1904 and were then discontinued. Measurements resumed in 1912 by a new railroad agent, and in 1915 the station operation was taken on by the State of New Mexico. The USGS resumed operation of the stream gauging station in July 1931.  Recognition  The site was designated a Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 1973 and listed on the New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties in 1974.

It dates from the 14th Century. It became an official residence of the Church of Ireland Archbishop of Dublin until 1822. It was taken over by the Dominican Order in 1856. The castle is now in ruins with only a small proportion of it incorporated into the St. Mary's Priory building, in the grounds of St. Mary's Dominican Priory and the Priory Institute The old palace gardens, Archbishop’s bathhouse, the Friar's Walk and St. Maelruain's Tree still remain in the current grounds. Development Tallaght village was first walled in about 1310. As ordered by Archbishop Alexander de Bicknor the initial castle was built between 1324 and the 1340s, to defend the town. The original castle is thought to have comprised high walls with a courtyard in the centre. It was in a bad condition a century later. In the mid 1400s, improvements were made by Archbishop Michael Tregury, leading to an increase in usage by subsequent Archbishops. Members of Archbishop Loftus's family were killed at the gates of the castle in the 1570s. Archbishop John Hoadly built a palace on the remains from 1727 to 1729 at a cost of £2,500. The grounds had a brewery and a granary and stables. By 1760 some of the buildings had become 'dilapidated'. In 1821, an Act of Parliament, was passed which stated that it was unfit for habitation. In 1822 the property was sold to Major Palmer, Inspector General of Prisons, who pulled most of the palace down and used the materials to build his mansion, 'Tallaght House', as well as a schoolhouse and several cottages. A tower from the original castle was left untouched and later was incorporated in the current priory building. The once four-storey- high tower now has just internally two. Major Palmer later sold the mansion and lands to his successor as Inspector of Prisons, Mr. Lentaigne. When the Dominican friars took a lease out on the property in the 1840s, one of the buildings was converted into a chapel. The friars eventually bought the property from Mr. Lentaigne in 1855. The chapel was replaced with a purpose built church, dedicated to Fr. Tom Burke, in 1883. Part of the house burned down in the first decade of the 1900s.

CNN mentioned Occupy Democrats in an online article about identifying misleading news, citing it as an example of a website using unverified photographs and videos. The example purported to show a female being ejected by police from a restroom for \\"not looking like a woman\\" due to a controversial law passed by North Carolina in March 2016, but Snopes found that the footage dated from at least 2015 and provided no context as to where the woman is and why she was ejected.

Its steep sides are clearly recognisable. () Siek is a north German term for a wet depression, hollow or lowland area. It is mainly used to describe typical cultural landscape elements in eastern Westphalia, especially in the county of Lippe and in the region of Ravensberg Land. In East Westphalia \\"siek\\" is a very common component of the names of tracts of land, roads, places and even personal names, e.g. Heidsiek, Siekhorst, Im Siek, Siekmann and Sieker.  Origins  The fertile loess soils in this region of north Germany are dissected by a host of brooks and headstreams, which used to flow in marshy V-shaped valleys. Not all Sieke are or were, however, crossed by a stream, but at the very least they always consisted of wet ground. During the course of medieval and early modern cultural and agricultural history, people developed these natural landforms by cutting into the edges of the V-shaped valleys (so-called Wiesenbrechen by Wiskenmaker Adolf Schüttler: Das Ravensberger Land. Aschendorff, Münster 1995, S. 13, ) and turning them into trough and box valleys, and any streams were regulated such that they ran in straight beds along the edges of such a box valley. The aim of these measures was the create a wet grassland in the now broad, accessible stream meadows which could then be extensively cultivated. In addition the cut, grass sods or plaggen were able to be used to fertilise the surrounding fields (Plaggendüngung). In Ravensberg Land, sieke are generally narrow, trough valleys interspersed in the countryside and lying next to cultivated areas of slightly higher ground or kuppen (Plaggenesche), which were raised by the grass sod fertilisation.  Importance today  Since, owing to the changed production conditions in modern agriculture, the grasslands in the sieken have become economically largely superfluous, many unused sieke would become marshy again in the long term without mowing and maintenance and turn into black alder carrs. Conservation and cultural landscape management today have the task of ensuring a balanced relationship between renaturalising sieken on the one hand and regularly mown grassland sieken on the other. An example of protected siek systems is the Kilverbach valley () and the Wöhrener Siek in Ravensberg Land.  Siepen  Etymologically probably related and conceptually similar is the valley landform known as asiepen, which is mainly found in the south Westphalian area and generally also describes wet valley bottoms, mostly stream-bearing V-shaped valleys.

Human towers is a Catalan tradition that started in the South of Catalonia 300 years ago. Traditionally there were teams only in Catalonia but recently other formations have been founded in other locations such as London, Chile, China, Paris, Melbourne, Sydney and others. Even though Castellers of Sydney have many Catalan members it also have members from different nationalities such as American, French, German, Australian among others.  History  Sydney human towers started their activity on 24 June 2016, doing for the first time in Sydney a pillar of 3, that consist in 3 levels one person on top of another. This was the first time the team performed in public, keeping thus this date as their anniversary. After this first public event they started rehearsing periodically every Thursday at 6pm at Hyde Park, gathering the attention of the Australian public and giving them the opportunity to know about the Catalan tradition and even experience it first hand by participating in the building of the human tower. The team has been improving periodically completing the 3of5, 4of5, pillar of 4 and 4of5 with a needle (a pillar inside the structure of 4) and 2of5 in this order, certifying not only a growth in members but also a technical growth completing more difficult towers every time. In their first anniversary the team tried for the very first time a 4of6, that was unloaded just before the \\"anxaneta\\", the kid at the top reached the top. Finally, on 10 September and celebrating the Catalan National Day in an event organised by \\"Casal Català de NSW\\" (Catalan Association of New South Wales) they completed the first towers of 6 levels in Oceania, making this the one the most remote tower in Human Towers history. In another performance on 17 February (and also organised by the Catalan Association of New South Wales) they completed the first full performance in Oceania with the collaboration of the Melbourne team, Koalas of Melbourne. A human towers full performance implies at least 3 towers of 6 or more and a pillar of 4. They completed it by completing a 3of6, 4of6 and 4of6 with the pillar. This is, until the date, the best performance ever done in Oceania.

Rescue Me  Rescue Me is a rehabilitation program for accused Islamist terrorists in Roumieh Prison. The program is based on research the sisters performed during their master's degree studies. After submitting their thesis titled \\"The Role of Forensic Social Work in Terrorism and Knowing its Reasons and Effects on Society,\\" the sisters created a system whereby they visit prisons holding accused terrorists to psychologically survey and rehabilitate them. In a profession never tackled before by women within the region. With little to no infrastructure to aid them in their difficult journey. The first in the Middle East. Nancy & Maya Yamout, two beautiful and intelligent Lebanese young ladies also known as The Kamikaze Girls made it their professional choice to tackle high-risk missions in the path of fighting terrorism their own unique way. Their battle started when they plunged into the mazes of Romieh Prison in Lebanon, an extremely dangerous & conservative environment with zero tolerance for women, especially among those who were or still are at the furthest end of extremism. The “Mulan Girls” interviewed and still do hundreds of imprisoned Jihadists in a relentless effort at deeply understanding their motives. This process was made possible through a technique developed by the sisters that employ a series of questionnaires that are exclusively focused around the detainee’s personal lives, childhood dreams and aspirations. A series of assessment were asked to each detainee to evaluate the pattern of their behavior, motives and early lives that led to them plunging into this dark world. It was not easy gaining the required level of trust and reaching tangible lead lines. The resulting conclusions of the study made by the sisters’ continuous research is today being circulated in the United States, Germany, Austria and Sweden. Conclusions that were a core element in publications now. Conclusions that enabled them to effectively comprehend what tips young people towards the black hole of extremism and terrorism with expertise employed at the diligent righteous fight towards the betterment of society through social work with prevention and rehabilitation under the umbrella of the “Rescue Me” organization that the sisters founded and established in 2011 with a vision of a society with safer homes, schools and communities.

Biography  Murray was born in Roehampton, London. He attended Uppingham School and Exeter College Oxford where he took a degree in Modern History and Jurisprudence. Murray joined the civil service in 1929 as an Assistant Principal in the Air Ministry, and was Private Secretary to the Permanent Secretary of the Air Ministry from 1931-1937. He graduated from the Imperial Defence College in 1938.Who Was Who, Murray, (Malcolm) Patrick. https://doi.org/10.1093/ww/9780199540884.013.U157868 published online 01 December 2007. Murray was recruited by Lord Selborne into the Special Operations Executive in November 1943 to work in the Vice-Chief's office as an officer on special duties at London HQ.The National Archives, HS 9/1079/2 He became an Administrative Head organising sabotage and resistance in occupied countries during the Second World War. His service number was 15724, and his classification symbol was V/CD2 from November 1943 and D/CD from January 1944. After the war he was Under Secretary in the Ministry of Fuel and Power from 1946. Murray was head of the Electricity Division of the Ministry for the exceptionally long period from 1947 to 1959, therefore during the nationalisation of the electricity industry in 1948, and the early stages of the development of the British civil nuclear power programme in the late 1950s. At the suggestion of Lord Citrine, the chairman of the British Electricity Authority (BEA), Murray attended the majority of the meetings between the BEA and the Area Board chairmen. He was thus able to convey government thinking to them informally, while sometimes receiving information off the record and relaying signals back to Whitehall. The sponsorship role of the Electricity Division led to Murray becoming not so much a controller of the industry as an honest broker between the central Authority and the Whitehall machine generally. In 1957 in discussions between the Minister of Power and the Country Landowner's Association the issue was raised whether a public inquiry should be held on any application from the Central Electricity Authority. The Electricity Bill was then being debated in Parliament and the issue might be included in the Bill. Murray was sceptical whether anything would be achieved. The Minister advised there was insufficient time to introduce such measures. Leslie Hannah notes that Murray was 'now not a well man' and had less influence on electricity matters than his fellow under- secretaries Owen Francis from the gas division who had been instrumental in drafting the 1957 Electricity Bill and the economist Philip Chantler. In 1959 Murray was Under-Secretary of the Electricity Division of the Ministry of Power under the Minister Lord Mills. Following the Public Inquiry into the proposed power station at Holme Pierrepoint, the Planning Inspector rejected the proposal. There was unanimous support for the report within the Ministry of Power. Murray minuted that even if the estimated cost of coal haulage of £600,000 per year was greater at any other site, as estimated by the CEGB, this was only 1 per cent of the annual cost of running the station. Murray was Director of Establishments Ministry of Power 1959-61 and Deputy Secretary Ministry of Power 1961-65. He retired from the civil service in 1965.  Personal Life  He married Betty Violet Black (b. 2 January 1909, daughter of Algernon Murray Black) on 11 August 1934 at Petersham parish church, Surrey.General Register Office, Marriage certificate, Registration District: Surrey North Eastern, vol. 2a page 165. She died in 1955. He secondly married Maisie Nora (Susan) Salmond (daughter of Walter Hemmingway) on 16 January 1956 at the register office Hampstead, London.General Register Office, Marriage Certificate, Registration District: Hampstead, vol 5c page 2132. In 1943 he listed his recreational interests as walking, rugby football, tennis, rowing and brick laying. His residences included Annery, Roehampton, London (1934); Corners, Bramley near Guildford, Surrey (1939-43); Scotsland, Bramley, Surrey; 1 Greville Place, Maida Vale, London NW6 (1956); Gorbio, France (1966), 26 Templemere, Oatlands Drive, Weybridge, Surrey (1978), and finally at Gorley Green Cottage, South Gorley, Fordingbridge, Hampshire where he died.

He was educated at Huddersfield New College and Oriel College, Oxford. Whilst at Oxford he was awarded a Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1967 for research on Many-body theory supervised by W. E. Parry. Research and career After his PhD he worked at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. Between 1969 and 1971, he was a research fellow at Magdalen College, Oxford. Between 1971 and 1976, he was a lecturer in physics at the University of Sussex. Moore has published many papers in statistical physics covering a wide range of topics. His early research was on the application of scaling theories to magnetic spin systems and superfluidity, and contained a series of useful results on critical indices. He then applied renormalisation group ideas to polymer solutions and clarified the relationship of this approach to previous theories; a particularly interesting result concerned the retrieval of the Flory index under approximation schemes. After some work on critical behaviour on surfaces, he joined the (then) new spin glass field, and in collaboration with Alan Bray wrote a series of important papers both on replica symmetry breaking in these systems and on their properties as revealed by computer simulation. In particular, he is associated with the droplet scaling theory of the spin glass state. In recent years, Michael has extended this work to structural glasses.

The two editors were nominated for an Academy Award, losing to the editors for Gone With the Wind. His third nomination came in 1940 for the classic political drama, All the King's Men, shared with Robert Parrish. The winner that year was Harry W. Gerstad for Champion. In 1958, he and William A. Lyon edited the western Cowboy, starring Glenn Ford and Jack Lemmon. However, the editing award that year went to Adrienne Fazan for Gigi. Clark's fifth and final Oscar nomination came in 1961, for his work on Pepe, which he co-edited by Viola Lawrence. That year the Oscar went to Daniel Mandell for The Apartment. His long association with Columbia came to an end in 1962, with Clark's work on The Interns. After his departure from Columbia, Clark edited only two more films: the 1963 comedy Hootenanny Hoot, for MGM; and the 1969 Elvis Presley western, Charro!. Beginning in 1952 on NBC's Cavalcade of America, Clark worked sporadically on television shows. His television credits include Dennis the Menace (1959), The Twilight Zone (1963), Gilligan's Island (1964), Perry Mason (1963–65), and I Dream of Jeannie (1965).

Realization of probation programs (decree of The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine from January 18, 2017 No. 24). Probation programs are destined for a person who is devoid of serving the penalty and envisage a complex of activities directed to correction social behavior, creation of social adapted changes for person which are susceptible to be verified (by the means of physiological correctional programs and programs of social adaptation conducted to eliminate negative factors which could influence on behavior of offender). At the period of supervision probation the law “On probation” permits to engage volunteers in actions on supervision and realization a social and correctional work with condemned persons. Volunteer is a physical person over the age of 18, authorized by Probation authority to implement voluntary and for free certain of assignments connected to the probation. In pursuance of the Statute about organization of volunteer activity at probation, approved by the decree of Ministry of Justice of Ukraine from January 17, 2017 No.98/5 the activity of volunteers will be performed on following senses: * Implementation of supervision activities at the work or education place of condemned persons; * Carrying out a social and educational work with condemned persons; * Elaboration and realization of personal plans with condemned persons; * Carrying out a social and preventive work with condemned persons; * Providing of consultations, psychological and others types of assistance to condemned persons; * Providing assistance for placing in a job, to attract condemned persons to education, educational activities and social helpful activities; * Realization of probation programs which concern persons devoid of serving the penalty; * Implementation of activities of preparation of persons who are serving theirs penalties by the means of deprivation of liberty or imprisonment for certain period until discharge. Realization of others activities directed to improvement of condemned persons and to prevent a repetition of a criminal offence by condemned person. Condemned persons have a right to choose a form of volunteer assistance in probation or to change a volunteer. The person should hand in an application for volunteering, to fill in a form, to be interviewed by the employee of Probation agency and to be added into the list on the basis of decision of head of probation.

Advantages of probation  = For offenders = * A possibility to improve themselves without staying in facilities where liberty is restricted (isolation from the society), support during improvement; * Preservation of family and public relations; * Preservation of job and home place; * Positive social effect: person keeps social relations and a chance to set up a family. = For society = * Preservation of society from the repetition of offences; * Equity justice, presence of balance between the penalty for an offence, damages exemplary and public interests. = For the state = * Decrease of criminality; * Decrease of numbers of imprisonment persons; * Positive economic effect: retention of offenders in facilities where liberty is restricted is much more expensive, than keeping them on probation; also condemned person saves a job place which means that person makes a tax-payment to the state budget; * Complying with European standards. History of probation in Ukraine In May 2002 the first official initiative to establish the probation service was submitted to the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine by the State Department on Enforcement of Sentences following a visit to the Prisons and Probation Service of the Kingdom of Sweden. On May 28, 2002 the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine issued the Order to the State Department of Ukraine on Enforcement of Sentences (ref. 3974/84) in order to approve its proposal to establish the probation service and prepare the first conceptual proposals for probation in Ukraine. After studying the proposals, which had been prepared by the Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Internal Affairs, Ministry of Labor and Social Policy, General Prosecutor's Office, Supreme Court of Ukraine, as well as interested NGOs and scholars, the State Department of Ukraine on Enforcement of Sentences formed the first vision of necessary legislative changes. Unfortunately, due to the novelty of the proposed legislative provisions, the issue of introducing probation in Ukraine was discussed and debated for almost six years. The probation introduction in Ukraine was included in the following state concepts: the Concept of the criminal justice reform of Ukraine, approved by the Decree of the President of Ukraine on April 8, 2008 (ref. 311/2008) and the Concept of reforming the State Penitentiary Service of Ukraine, approved by the Decree of the President of Ukraine on April 25, 2008 (ref. 401/2008). On November 26, 2008 in the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine the People’s Deputy of Ukraine V. Shvets registered the draft laws of Ukraine “On Probation Service” (ref. 3412) and “On amendments to certain legislative acts of Ukraine (on humanization of the criminal law and organizational legal preconditions for the probation introduction) ”(ref. 3413). It will be fair to mention the registration of one more legislative initiative with a proposal to define probation as a type of release from punishment - the draft law of Ukraine \\"On amendments to certain legislative acts of Ukraine (on humanization of the criminal law through the probation introduction)\\", which was registered by O. Feldman on November 28, 2008 (ref. 3413-1) as an alternative to the previous draft law (ref. 3413). It became the competitive element, which initiated constructive discussions on the content of probation in Ukraine. Unfortunately, the discussion and promotion of the draft laws (ref. 3412 and 3413) was slowed down, because of the interdepartmental contradictions regarding the organization of the probation agency subordination (either the new independent body of executive power or the unit in the structure of the State Department of Ukraine on Enforcement of Sentences, which would provide the function of execution of the alternative sanctions). On the other hand, the postponement of the agreed decision gave the possibility to continue discussions on the concept of probation, as well as to take into account the experience of foreign countries, which created and improved their probation systems. New views on the content of the above mentioned draft laws emerged. Thus, on January 20, 2010 the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe adopted Recommendation CM/Rec(2010)1 on the European probation rules, which specified functioning of the modern European probation systems. A new impetus for intensifying the development of the probation legislation in Ukraine was the Concept on development of the criminal justice for juveniles in Ukraine, which was approved by the Decree of the President of Ukraine on May 24, 2011 (ref. 597/2011). Despite the fact that the Concept referred only to the juvenile probation, it became clear that work on the probation system would continue. The concept of the state policy in the sphere of reforming the State Penitentiary Service of Ukraine, which was approved by the Decree of the President of Ukraine on November 8, 2012 (ref. 631/2012), one of six conceptual areas of reforming the Service envisaged the enhancement of the non-custodial sentences effectiveness and provided for measures to create legal and logistical conditions for reforming the criminal-executive inspection into the probation service. On January 4, 2013 there were registered the new draft laws in the sphere of probation: the draft Law “On the Probation Service” (ref. 1197); the draft Law “On amendments to certain legislative acts of Ukraine (regarding humanization of the criminal law through the probation introduction)” (ref. 1198). The subject of that legislative initiative was the People's Deputy of Ukraine V. Shvets (the re- registration of the previous draft laws of 2008 actually took place). The draft Law \\"On Probation\\" (ref. 1197-1) was registered on January 18, 2013 (it was a reflection of the new view on the legislative regulation of the probation issues). The subject of that legislative initiative was the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. On March 22, 2013 those draft laws were considered by the Permanent Committee of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine on Legislative Support of the Law Enforcement Activities. It made the decision to recommend to the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine to adopt the draft Law (ref. 1197-1) as a basis. On October 10, 2013 the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine (282 positive votes) adopted the Law of Ukraine “On Probation” (ref. 1197-1) in the first reading. More than one year later, on February 5, 2015 the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted the Law of Ukraine “On Probation” (230 positive votes). It came into force on August 27, 2015. Thus, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine made the real step in approximation of the justice of Ukraine to the international standards and introduction of the fundamentally new system of the criminal law measures – probation. Thirteen years of hesitation and discussion in the scientific and political circles about the expediency and timeliness of such reform in Ukraine were put to the end! Measures to create and develop the national model of probation were included in the Strategy of reforming the judiciary and related legal institutions for the period 2015-2020 (Decree of the President of Ukraine of 20.05.2015, ref. 276) and the National strategy in the sphere of human rights (Decree of the President of Ukraine of 25.08.2015, ref. 501). The legal basis has been created for the introduction of the national probation system, which is defined as the system of the supervisory and social- educational measures applied by the court decision in accordance with the Law “On convicts”. It also envisages pre-trial reports for the courts (information, which characterizes the accused persons in order the courts decide on the extent of their responsibility). Despite all the shortcomings of the Law of Ukraine \\"On Probation\\", which is still criticized and needs further improvement, the international experts say that the Law meets the European standards of probation. The provisions of the Law of Ukraine \\"On Probation\\" were harmonized with other laws by adopting the Law of Ukraine of September 7, 2016 (ref.1492-VIII) \\"On amendments to certain legislative acts of Ukraine related to enforcement of sentences and protection of the rights of convicts\\". The Law amended the Criminal Code, the Criminal-Executive Code and the Criminal-Procedural Code of Ukraine (in particular, the authorized probation units were added to the list of the penitentiary bodies; the pre-trial reports procedure was created; probation supervision, probation programmes and measures were envisaged). In March 2016 the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine started the reform of the State Penitentiary Service and created in its structure the central probation department and probation units at 6 interregional prison and probation departments. The authorized probation units formed the structure of the national probation. Actually, they started to function on January 1, 2017. On that date there were 498 authorized probation units with 3,300 officers (lawyers, social workers and psychologists). In order to create the full-fledged probation system the Public Institution \\"Center of Probation\\" was established by the Order of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine of September 13, 2017 (ref.655-p). It improved organizational structure and the mechanism of using the financial, material and technical means for the effective functioning of the probation units, which were subordinated to the Center of Probation. On January 1, 2020 there was the Public Institution \\"Center of Probation\\", 24 regional units and 574 local units of the probation service, as well as 14 juvenile probation sectors. Their activities were provided by 3,022 employees (lawyers, social workers and psychologists). _On January 1, 2020 there were 60,736 sentenced persons, who had been registered by the authorized probation units, in particular:_ * 2,985 persons (4.9%) were punished in the form of deprivation of the right to hold certain jobs (positions) or to be engaged in certain activities; * 3,104 persons (5%) - were punished in the form of community works; * 459 persons (0.8%) - were punished in the form of correctional works; * 50,266 persons (82.8%) finished their probation period; * 3,922 persons (6.5%) - were punished in the form of a fine. _The pre-trial probation statistics (on January 1, 2020):_ * 30,089 (92%) pre-trial reports were prepared; * 20,567 (68%) accused persons used the right to participate in the preparation of the pre-trial reports; * probation opinion on the possibility of correction of the accused persons without restriction or deprivation of liberty of 23,878 (79%) was provided to the courts; * in 9,209 (90%) court sentences the probation opinion in the pre-trial report was taken into account. _The penitentiary probation statistics (on January 1, 2020):_ * 6,410 (82%) answers to the pre- agreed questions on the sentenced persons’ residence after their release; * 2,014 (95%) answers to the pre-agreed questions on the sentenced persons’ employment after their release. Probation of Ukraine – opportunity for change! This motto of our probation contains the multifaceted philosophy of the opportunities: from changing the offenders’ legal consciousness and life, from changing approaches to the offenders’ rehabilitation, from the rights of victims and the community interests – to changing the society and the State as a whole.

His sculptural work focuses on African and African American history.  Early life and education  Charles Smith was born in New Orleans in 1940 to Bertha Mary Smith. When Smith was 14 his father was drowned in a hate crime. His mother moved him and his two sisters to Chicago after his father's racially motivated murder. They lived in the diverse Maxwell Street District near 14th Street. A year later, in 1955, Mrs. Smith took Charles to view the body of Emmett Till at the Roberts Temple Church of God. These experiences helped to seed Smith's understanding of racism in the States. In 1964 Smith worked for Trans World Airlines and as a postal carrier, working the two jobs in order to save money to purchase a home for his new wife and himself. In 1966 Smith was drafted into the Marine Corps where he spent two years in Vietnam, being honorably discharged with a Purple Heart in 1968 due to injury. The physical impact of Agent Orange caused health issues that continue to this day. He was also severely psychologically and spiritually impacted from experiences there, resulting in Smith's divorce and increasing Posttraumatic stress disorder through 18 years of post-combat struggle before finding his calling as an artist. Besides his formal studies at the Virginia Black Training Academy, for his numerous years of life experience, studying and wisdom, Smith began using his self-imposed title, as an equivalency to a PhD.  Career  Thematically, Charles' work confronts what he sees as the erasure of Black history by recreating scenes and icons of those narratives in a formula of concrete and mixed media of his invention. His work is created and in situ is housed primarily outdoors. = Aurora, Illinois = In 1986 Smith began fourteen years of often twelve-hour-day cathartic creative work on his home in Aurora, Illinois as an art environment. He said God told him to make art as a weapon to combat his depression, pain and anger. He built sculptures and monuments to memorialize moments in Black history and racism. He began with his own experience and struggle as a US Marine Corps veteran and has documented moments before American slavery through the present. He established this outdoor museum as the non-profit African American History Museum and Black Veteran's Archive. His Aurora site culminated in 600 sculptures and 150 fixed pieces. The Art Institute of Chicago named his museum a Millennium Site in 1999. Smith is one of three living artists whose work is part of the John Michael Kohler Art Center's permanent collection. The Kohler Foundation purchased 448 of Smith's work from his Aurora, Illinois in 2000, of which 200 remained in their Art Center's permanent collection. Smith maintains a relationship to Aurora Illinois, having set up a foundation to care for the site after his departure. In 2004 there was an opening celebration cosigned by Kane County and Aurora Township with tourism in mind. Despite this first property falling to disrepair and precarious community support, the remaining sculptures still paint a narrative that draws tourists. Emmett Till's mother, Mamie Till, wrote Smith a letter thanking him for creating a work so impactful. =Hammond, Louisiana= In 2002 Smith was traveling to New Orleans to help his ailing mother when he stopped to rest and found a grave stone of Peter Hammond's \\"Unnamed Slave Boy.\\" This became a calling for him to relocate to Hammond, Louisiana and has established his second art environment and a new Museum there. The Hammond site's house references Egyptian architecture and ancient tomb and is boldly painted black and white. The steps to the front door read, \\"Trust God.\\"  Exhibitions  Smith's work is in the permanent collection of the Smithsonian American Art Museum. His work was included in Life, Liberty & Pursuit of Happiness at the American Visionary Art Museum in 2010. In 2017 he lectured at the African American Men of Unity in Aurora and at The Road Less Traveled conference in Sheboygan, Wisconsin. His work was auctioned at the New Orleans Botanical Garden benefit in 2017. His work was included in The Kohler Art Center's 50th Anniversary exhibition series, The Road Less Traveled in 2017-18. His exhibition for this series was honored as the number two selection for \\"Best of 2017\\" in Art Forum magazine. In 2018 Smith's work was included the 10-artist exhibition, Chicago Calling: Art Against the Flow, curated by Lisa Stone and Kenneth Burkhart at Intuit: The Center for Intuitive and Outsider Art as part of Art Design Chicago. Included in the exhibit with Smith's work were works by Henry Darger, Gregory Warmack (known as “Mr. Imagination”), Joseph Yoakum and Lee Godie. Smith was the only living artist in the exhibition. Works Smith heavily uses metaphor, symbolism, news stories, historical narratives and his own experiences in the formal choices and spatial relationships of his sculptures to create his dense art environments. Visitors weave around the pieces following his often life- sized dioramas and the literal path he has made for tours. Besides his life experience, his motivation is to heal the world by educating people about Black history through his work. The installation was constantly evolving and changing as Smith built new work. \\"Everything moves along extemporaneously as God moves me. He shows me how to do it, where to put it, and how to construct it.\\" Smith said. Middle Passage was created out of large rock, broken concrete, and wood. It depicted the narrative of Black people in Africa, going through the Middle Passage and into slavery. The work was installed on North Avenue at South Kendall Street in Aurora, Illinois. The sculpture acted as a perimeter protecting to his environment and went on to include imagery from the Civil Rights Movement, all with three-quarters to life sized figures. Most of his work is built with found materials with a cement mixture covering armatures and then painted. He calls the patina the sculptures gain through exposure to the outdoor elements \\"weatherization.\\" Sergeant Ramey was at the center of his Aurora property atop his roof. It is a memorial depicting one of Smith's close friends who died in combat, a memory that stays with Smith. Smith's goal has been to teach Black youth about their history and he wants to have work installed at certain points along I-55 to memorialize not only the Great Migration but also his family's migration from New Orleans to Chicago. Each site would document and offer healing lessons on Black history. Personal life Smith was married in 1964 and divorced after his return from combat in 1968. Alongside his sculptural work Smith was an ordained minister. He was a pastor at God's House of Prayer and Holiness in Memphis Tennessee. Much of his work outside of his sculpture is working to help heal people psychologically. He's advocated for other Vietnam veterans, worked with the Congressional Black Caucus on Agent Orange and on Jesse Jackson's PUSH coalition.

It is a cylindrical, red, metallic tower, thirteen meters high, with a lantern and balcony and attached buildings. History The small maritime fort of São Brás of Sanxete was originally erected, together with the nearby fort of Cresmina, to protect the Guincho Beach, a vast sandy area where enemy ships could easily disembark troops. In 1894 the fort ceased to serve a defensive function and a lighthouse beacon was installed on the site. In 1884, the Portuguese Commission on Lighthouses and Beacons decided on the need for construction of a lighthouse at Cabo Raso. The original plan was modified in 1893, because it was going to prove too expensive. The cheaper solution involved building a house for the lighthouse keeper, with 4 rooms. The light was installed on a slab positioned in front of one of the windows of the house, and, after its use, was moved into the interior of the room on a wooden carriage that rested on rails. This lighthouse went into operation on January 1, 1894, with a fixed oil light. In 1914, a sound signal was added, created by a tube of compressed air. The following year, the light of the lighthouse was finally transferred to the current iron tower, which is painted red and has a range of twenty nautical miles. This lighthouse was electrified in 1947, connected to the public power grid in 1969 and automated in 1984. In December 2003 the previous light system was replaced and an ML-300 flashlight with TF 3B flasher and 50W12V lamps was installed.

She was reported missing after Nautilus failed to return to Refshaleøen, Copenhagen. The submarine was found sunken the following morning and Madsen was arrested upon being rescued from the water. Between 21 August and 29 November, Wall's dismembered body parts were found in different locations around the area. Charged with her murder, Madsen was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment on 25 April 2018 by Copenhagen City Court following a widely publicised trial. The case is also known in Denmark as ().  Kim Wall  Kim Isabel Fredrika Wall (22 March 1987 – 10 or 11 August 2017) was a Swedish freelance journalist. She was born in Trelleborg, Scania, to Ingrid and Joachim Wall, and had a younger brother, Tom. After graduating from high school in Malmö, Wall received a bachelor's degree in international relations at the London School of Economics and a dual master's degree in journalism and international relations at Columbia University in New York City. At the time of her death, she lived with her Danish boyfriend Ole Stobbe in Refshaleøen, Copenhagen. Wall wrote reports about a variety of topics for publications such as The Guardian, The New York Times, Vice, Slate, and Time. In March 2016, the German journalist association Zeitenspiegel awarded her the Hansel Mieth Prize for Best Digital Reportage for \\"Exodus\\", a multi-media report on climate change and nuclear weapons testing in the Marshall Islands, which was published by Süddeutsche Zeitung.  Events  = Disappearance and discovery of remains = UC3 Nautilus On Thursday, 10 August 2017, Wall and Stobbe were preparing to host a farewell party in Refshaleøen prior to their planned move to Beijing on 16 August. Before the party, she received a text from Danish entrepreneur Peter Madsen—with whom she had requested an interview earlier in the year—inviting her to interview him on board his midget submarine UC3 Nautilus. Wall agreed to join him on the submarine for two hours and boarded Nautilus around 19:00 local time (UTC+2). The submarine never returned to the harbour and Stobbe called the police at 01:43 that night to report Wall missing. Nautilus was sighted in Køge Bay southeast of Amager by Drogden lighthouse at 10:30 the next morning; it foundered at 11:00. On 21 August 2017, a cyclist found Wall's torso washed up on a beach in the southwest of Amager. A post-mortem examination found fifteen stab wounds, mostly in the groin. On 6 October, assisted by police dogs, police divers found two plastic bags in Køge Bay containing Wall's head, legs, clothes and a knife; six days later, a saw was found in the water. On 21 and 29 November, police divers found Wall's arms in the bay. Police probed possible links to other murder cases in Scandinavia, including the unsolved death of 22-year-old Kazuko Toyonaga in 1986 in Copenhagen, but did not find connections to any of them. = Legal proceedings = Peter Madsen Madsen was arrested upon being rescued from Køge Bay after Nautilus foundered on 11 August 2017, and was charged with negligent manslaughter. Police suspected that he had scuttled the submarine. Madsen initially stated that he had dropped Wall off on land, but then admitted to dumping her body at sea after she died in what he claimed was an accident on board Nautilus. He testified in a court hearing on 5 September that Wall died after being struck on the head by the submarine's hatch cover. The prosecution said that police had found videos on Madsen's computer showing women being murdered, and that witnesses said that they had seen Madsen watching videos of decapitation and practising asphyxiation sex. A post-mortem examination performed on Wall's head after it was found a month later found no signs of blunt trauma to the head and did not determine the cause of death. Madsen subsequently changed his story, admitting to dismembering Wall's body but continuing to deny intentionally killing her, saying that she may have died after poisonous exhaust gases entered the submarine while he was on deck. The post-mortem performed on Wall's torso showed no signs of exhaust gases in her lungs. On 16 January 2018, Madsen was charged with murder, indecent handling of a corpse, and sexual assault. The prosecution accused him of having tortured Wall before killing her by cutting her throat or strangling her. Madsen's trial began on 8 March at Copenhagen Court House. On 25 April, he was convicted of all three charges and sentenced to life imprisonment. Madsen appealed his sentence and on 26 September Østre Landsret, High Court of Eastern Denmark, upheld the sentence. = Aftermath = In August 2018, Madsen was admitted to the hospital after being attacked in prison by an 18-year-old fellow inmate. In a Danish September 2020 documentary, Madsen admitted that he had killed Kim Wall. = 2020 prison escape attempt = On 20 October 2020, Madsen briefly escaped from prison by threatening a prison employee said to be a psychologist, using a \\"pistol like object\\", before fleeing equipped with an object he claimed to be a bomb belt. However, the bomb squad was deployed and Madsen was surrounded and apprehended by police from the prison, subsequently being taken back into custody. https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-54612455 Peter Madsen: Police surround Danish inventor who killed journalist after prison escape attempt Sky News Retrieved 20 October 2020  Legacy  After her death, Wall's family and friends started the Kim Wall Memorial Fund, aiming to fund female reporters to cover stories of subcultural value. A memorial run was organised in which people around the world were allowed to run or walk a distance in her memory, and took place on 10 August 2018, the first anniversary of her murder. In October 2017, Wall was posthumously nominated for Prix Europa's Outstanding Achievement Award \\"Journalist of the Year\\". On 9 November 2018, Wall's parents published a book in her memory titled Boken om Kim Wall: När orden tar slut (). The book appeared in English in 2020 under the title A Silenced Voice and translated by Kathy Saranpa. Also in 2018, Wall's boyfriend Stobbe related his experiences with the media coverage about the case in Danish newspaper Weekendavisen.https://www.journalisten.se/nyheter/kim-walls-pojkvan-bryter- tystnadenhttps://www.weekendavisen.dk/2019-32/samfund/hvad-medierne-laaner- leveres-aldrig-tilbage Efterforskningen (English: The Investigation) is a Danish-language television dramatization created by Tobias Lindholm, which follows the criminal investigation of the case.

It is capable of both accurately identifying and making precise 3D spatial and calorimetric measurements of particles. Currently, it is in the calibration phase of development. At present, the LArIAT collaboration has more than 65 members from 17 institutions worldwide, including Yale University, the University of Manchester, and KEK.  The LArIAT detector  LArIAT itself is a cylindrical cryostat with convex ends, capable of holding 550L of liquid argon. The cryostat is heavily insulated thermally, in part by a region of vacuum surrounding it. Inside the cryostat is the time projection chamber, in which the argon atoms are ionized by beam particles. An electric field is applied across the chamber perpendicular to the beam direction, causing the ionization electrons to move towards the side, where they are detected by two wire planes oriented at ±30° to the vertical. These wire planes are made up of 240 parallel wires with a separation of 4mm. A third wire plane of 225 wires, aligned along the vertical axis, is placed in front of the other two planes in order to prevent the electric field from interfering with the instrumentation. Ionization of liquid argon emits characteristic 128 nm light (in the violet/ultraviolet range), which is detected by a scintillation read-out system. This system has a high efficiency, having been designed using systems developed for dark matter liquid argon detectors. This gives LArIAT an advantage over other existing liquid argon detectors which are only able to perform calorimetry using the wire grids.

Christian Heurich Brewing Company, established in 1872, was the largest brewery in the District of Columbia. At one point, Heurich owned more land than any other landowner in Washington, DC with the exception of the Federal Government.

This village is not to be confused with the Haina near Gotha (also in Thuringia), nor with the Haina in the Waldeck-Frankenberg section of Hesse. Christian was the third of four children born to Casper and Marguerite (née Fuchs) Heurich.Benbow, Mark (2011-06-08/updated 2014-09-25). \\"Christian Heurich (1842-1945).\\" In: Immigrant Entrepreneurship: German- American Business Biographies (a research project of the German Historical Institute, Washington, DC). Retrieved 2015-02-14. Christian's father was the local innkeeper which included being a butcher and brewer. Christian learned the trade from his father, in addition to several apprenticeships in his youth. By the time Christian was fourteen years old, both of his parents had died, leaving him orphaned. He traveled throughout Europe until his older sister, Elizabeth Jacobsen, who was living in Baltimore, Maryland, convinced him to emigrate to the United States, where he would have a better chance of fulfilling his dream of starting his own brewery; he arrived in June 1866, initially joining his sister in Baltimore.  Christian Heurich, the Brewer  In 1872, Christian went into a partnership with a man named Paul Ritter. Together, they leased a brewery from George Schnell at 1219 20th Street, NW Washington, D.C. Within a year, Mr. Schnell had died and the partnership between the two men had dissolved. In his 1934 autobiography, Aus meinem Leben, Heurich writes that he was the one who did most of the labor of brewing, while Schnell entertained customers. Christian married the widow of Mr. Schnell, Amelia Mueller Schnell on September 9, 1873. In 1884, Amelia died of pneumonia. In 1887, Christian married for the second time to Mathilde Daetz. It was with Mathilde that he built their lavish mansion at 1307 New Hampshire Avenue NW. Mathilde worked very closely with the interior designers of the house, The Huber Brothers, NYC. Sadly, due to miscarriage and a carriage accident, Mathilde died in 1895, leaving Christian a widower once again. Christian threw himself into his work, creating an empire in the capital city. In 1894 he opened his new, fireproof brewery which had a capacity for 500,000 barrels of beer a year.

History On 7 March 1927, Bengali Hindus were going towards the Ponabalia Shiva temple in a procession on the occasion of Shivaratri in Ponabalia, Nalchity, Jhalokati District, Barisal Division, East Bengal, British India. The procession was singing Sankirtan and beating drums. The processions was passing by a mosque where Muslims were praying. The Muslims asked to the Hindus to observe silence, which they refused. The Muslims tried to stop the procession by creating a human barricade. Satindranath Sen, an Satyagraha activist, asked the Hindus to perform Sankirtan louder. The e District Magistrate, E. N. Blandy, and Superintendent of Police, Taylor rushed to the scene along with a Police force. The Muslims were unable to communicate with the British officials as they were illiterate. So they tried to communicate to the officers through hand gestures that they would rather die than have their prayers disturbed. The Hindus who were literate and could speak English, told the officers that the Muslims wanted to kill them. Blandy, misled, ordered the police to fire, killing 20 Muslims and more wounded. Other reports suggested a Muslim speared a police officer. Aftermath Few days later the All Bengal Muslim Conference called for inquiry commission into the incident. The commission was formed and it submitted a report, which was never published. The incident has been called an evidence of communal disharmony during the post-Noncooperation in rural Bengal and was highlighted by the Muslim press.

She was a founder of the Swiss Federation of Abstinent Women, an organization that supported the temperance movement in Switzerland. She served as the co- International chair of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF) from 1929 to 1946. Early life Clara Nadig was born on 30 March 1874 in Chur, in the Grisons canton of Switzerland to Christina (née Plattner) and Johann Josua Nadig. She studied to be a teacher, completing her training in 1892 at the normal school in Aarau. Career Nadig first taught in England and France before returning to Switzerland. She taught in a Sunday school and became involved in missionary work, which is how she met the social activist Leonhard Ragaz in 1893, whom she married in 1901. She took a teaching position in the Engadin valley, while her husband served as the chief Protestant cleric of Chur between 1902 and 1906. In 1902, she was one of the founders of the Swiss Federation of Abstinent Women (), an arm of the international temperance movement in Switzerland. In 1907, she joined the feminist organization Union for the Advancement of Women (), when the couple were in Bern and her husband served as a pastor for the Basel Minster. In 1908, they moved to Zürich, where Ragaz continued teaching and her husband was engaged as a professor of theology at the University of Zurich. In Zürich Ragaz joined the buyer's collective known as the Social Buyer's League (), which aimed at improving the situation of workers through conscious buying methods of consumers, and remained a part of the group until 1915. Together with Emma Pieczynska-Reichenbach she worked towards improving the minimum wage of female workers, shorter working hours, and better working conditions. In 1909, Ragaz served as the director of the Swiss Home Works Exhibition (), which featured spinning, straw works, cobbling and other handcrafted items created by women, but also discussed the problems of working women, unsanitary conditions and child labor practices. In 1913, she joined the Socialist Party of Switzerland and along with her husband practiced religious socialism, believing that Christian faith required a social conscience that focused on helping working class people. In 1915, Ragaz co-founded the Committee for a Lasting Peace (German: Komitee für einen dauernden Frieden) and would serve as its president until 1946. That same year, she published Women in Peace from a talk she had given. In 1919 she played a key role in bringing the Congress of Zurich to the city, which led to the foundation of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. The meeting followed on from the 1915 Hague Congress of Women, held by feminist internationalist women seeking to end World War 1. Ragaz was the opening speaker for the Congress of Zurich, alongside renowned feminist Jane Addams. She continued to work with the international WILPF in Geneva. In 1921, she published a translation of Tagore as Educator by Emma Pieczynska-Reichenbach. That same year, her husband quit his university job and the couple moved to the Aussersihl district to live among the workers there. They were committed to the social welfare of the working class and Ragaz began giving lectures at the Social School for Women (). Ragaz translated the work Religious Foundations of the Social Gospel by Walter Rauschenbusch, one of his most influential books, into German in 1922. In 1929, Ragaz succeeded Jane Addams as one of the co-International Chairs of the WILPF. Because of the volume of work to be done, it was decided that the responsibilities Addams had carried were to be shared with Gertrud Baer and Emily Greene Balch. That same year, she was appointed as the vice president of the boarding school at the Social School for Women and served in that capacity until 1946. Ragaz, Baer, and Balch, who was later replaced by Kathleen Innes steered the WILPF during the difficult war years, when defending borders and simultaneously advocating an anti-war stance often were at odds. Both she and her husband resigned from the socialist party in 1935 over the stance of national defense. She remained active in the pacifist movement until the war ended. Death and legacy Ragaz died on 7 October 1957 in Zurich. In 2015, a lecture series honoring her pacifist work was presented by the Association of Eastern Swiss Women in St. Gallen, Switzerland.

Reviewing the Festival d'Automne performance of Shades of Words, Martin Kaltenecker writes, > Andile Khumalo's Shades of words is a melodrama built upon spoken poems > (sent by mail to a friend of the composer) accompanied by seven instruments > which envelop the poetic fragments with subtle and often 'Sciarrinian' > textures. George Lewis has also written of the piece, > This extraordinarily compact composition performs with aplomb the bridging > of the temporal gulf between words, which can generate an entire network of > associations in an instant, and music, which despite its reputation for > immediacy, takes its time to construct its environment. While many composers > routinely report their interest in \\"time\\"–a seeming truism–the implication > of Khumalo's composition goes beyond now-conventional disruptions and > transgressions of disciplinary boundaries. Shades of Words transposes > disciplinary contentions and struggles for meaning to a higher and more > resonant register that asks us how to reconcile two experiences of time: one > in remembrance, recollection, and fantasy, where indeterminacy and agency > meet, and the other on a (now often virtual) page, operating in the > interstices between immediacy and permanence. While these reviews are mostly positive, Lukas Ligeti has suggested that Khumalo's music is derivative: > Andile Khumalo's Shades of Words, a setting of poetry by Alexandra Zelman- > Doring, was written in the style of European post-second-Viennese- > school/Darmstadt modernism. The relevance of this Eurocentric music to the > cultural situation in South Africa is debatable, and newly-created music in > this idiom is almost inevitably derivative. Perhaps Khumalo, now back in > South Africa after many years of studies in Germany and the United States, > will yet develop a South African slant to this style of music, leading to a > more individual voice. Of Cry Out, Kaltenecker writes that the piece > proved to be a virtuosic piece played mezza voce, culminating at the very > end in a striking texture of strident sounds, the oboist turning to play the > woodblocks in dialogue with high pizzicati from the viola and the piano. Other critical perspectives on the composer have tended to consider his role as a non-Western composer writing in a style largely ascribed to Western composers. Chris van Rhyn, for instance, has written that while many composers in post-apartheid South Africa reverted to an accessible musical aesthetic rooted in basic tonal concepts, Khumalo tends to compose in a more abstract manner. Of this, Van Rhyn suggests that > perhaps in the case of [Khumalo], it served a young black South African > composer well to not reproduce [the shift an accessible aesthetic], so as to > challenge persisting notions of the African as primitive (natural, tonal) > compared to the west as modern (universal, abstract). When looking at the > other works by Khumalo in my possession (ISO(R) for flute, cello and piano > (2004), Ossia for clarinet and cello (2010) and Schaufe(r)nster for piano > (2011)), it is clear that Khumalo does not aim to always denote 'Africa' in > his works. Georg Beck suggests a similar defiance in Khumalo's music when he writes of Cry Out that > das klug und einfühlsam gebaute Ensemblestück des jungen > schwarzafrikanischen Komponisten Andile Khumalo, hielt denselben konsequent > [unter einer wispernden, stetig gespannten Oberfläche verborgen. Musik, die > (gegen die Erwartungen unseres \\"postkolonialen\\" Bewusstseins) gerade nicht > die große Geste sucht, keine schwarze Faust zeigt, die vielmehr auf einer > sehr europäisch geschulten Material- und Instrumentalebene elementare Fragen > eines südafrikanischen Komponisten von heute verhandelt: Wie kann das > Individuum, hier die Bratsche, allen gegenläufigen Umständen im Ensemble zum > Trotz, seinen Weg gehen? > [the clever and sensitive ensemble of the young Black African composer > Andile Khumalo, concealed [the notion of crying out] consistently under a > whispering, constantly tensioned surface.

Career Law started his YouTube channel in December 2014. The first video he uploaded was of him performing parkour on the top of buildings in Southampton city centre, filmed on a GoPro camera. Law started to receive local media attention in the Southern Daily Echo for his stunts in December 2015, after he scaled Dumbleton Towers in the Thornhill area of the city. Law has climbed in multiple locations around the world, such as Melbourne, Dubai, Bangkok, and Barcelona. Law also does 'overnight challenges', where he and a group of friends will attempt to stay in a range of commercial premises after closing hours.

It led to the partition of the Mataram Sultanate into two, and later three, nominally independent 'Princely States': Surakarta, Yogyakarta and Mangkunegara. Cause The cause of the third Javanese succession war was the bad treatment by Governor-General of Imhoff of the brother of the Ruler Pakubuwana II of Surakarta. This Jason Mangku Bumi or Mangka, rebelled against the Dutch East India Company, which had disparaged him in his eyes, and against his brother, which he regarded as too compliant towards the Dutch (1749). Mangkubumi was in his fight against the Dutch supported by Raden Mas Said his cousin, a brilliant soldier, who has been a guerrilla warfare against the Dutch East India Company. History In the midst of Mangkubumi rebellion in 1749, Pakubuwana II fell ill and called Van Hohendorff, his trusted friend who saved his life during the fall of Kartasura in 1742. He asked Hohendorff to assume control over the kingdom. Hohendorff was naturally surprised and refused, thinking that he would be made king of Mataram, but when the king insisted on it, he asked his sick friend to confirm it in writing. On 11 December 1749, Pakubuwana II signed an agreement in which the \\"sovereignty\\" of Mataram was given to VOC. Mangku Bumi, who saw themselves as the rightful heir to the throne, demanded the title of ruler on. for its part the VOC continued a powerless puppet, Pakubuwana III of Surakarta on the throne. By the people of Mataram was Mangku Bumi, like Frost Hamengkubuwana called, as the only real ruler of Mataram and regarded as a freedom fighter. After years of changing fight with battles at Grobogan, Demak and members the Dutch under de Clerck a crushing defeat at the Bogowonto River. Hereinafter referred to as Governor-General Mossel decided to peace negotiations with Hamengkubuwana. This eventually led to the conclusion of the 'Treaty of Giyanti, named after the place East of Surakarta where the negotiations took place: the Kingdom of Mataram was divided between the two warring parties. The old capital Kartasura, which as a result of the fratricidal out there had taken place as a doom-laden place was considered, was abandoned. The Pakubuwana III, founded as faithful to the Dutchmen Ruler a new kraton in Surakarta and controlled the eastern part of Mataram (Kasoenanan Solo or Surakarta) (1750-1788). On the other hand, reigned as sultan Hamengkubuwana I over the Western half of Mataram, and he built North of the old capital Kartasura, his new kraton Yogyakarta (Kasultanan Yogyakarta) (1755-1792). MAS Said the fight is not for also gave to him a part of Mataram as 'princely state' was given: he ruled as Mangkoenegara, built his own kraton in the proximity of the Surakarta/Solo and was especially areas in the extreme South- East of Mataram as its inheritance (Mangkoenegaran) (1757-1796).

Background Kathleen Scofield (\\"Katie\\") was born on December 28, 1903, in New York City. Her father, Leonard B. Schoenfeld, was a stockbroker; both parents were of German and Austrian Jewish ancestry. Her father changed their surname to \\"Scofield\\" to sound less German during World War I. In 1921, she graduated from Rosemary Hall boarding school in Greenwich, Connecticut, where she was one of three Jewish girls in her class. In 1926, she started studies at Columbia University but had to stop in 1927 and went instead to secretarial school for financial reasons. Career In October 1934, Louchheim moved from New York City to Washington, where her husband would help organize the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under Joseph P. Kennedy during the first stage of FDR's New Deal. During World War II, she served in the Office of Foreign Relief and Rehabilitation and helped form its United Nations counterpart, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA). In 1945, she traveled to Europe to arrange press relations at camps for displaced people. In the 1930s, Louchheim used their home in Georgetown to network. She raised funds for the Democratic National Committee (DNC). While fundraising for FDR's 1940 presidential campaign, she came to know Eleanor Roosevelt. In 1948 (and 1952), she was a DNC delegate for Washington, DC, and seconded the nomination for Helen Gahagan Douglas. In 1949, she became a member of the Washington, DC, committee of the DNC. By 1953, she was heading the DNC's Office of Women's Activities, succeeding India Edwards. By 1956, she had become DNC vice chair for Daisy Harriman, which she held through 1960. Also in 1956, she accompanied Adlai Stevenson II on his campaign for the presidency. In 1960, Robert F. Kennedy \\"booted\\" her from the DNC; instead, she campaigned for JFK. U.S. President John F. Kennedy gave her the post of special assistant for women's affairs the U.S. Department of State, where in 1966 she became Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs–at the time, the highest level there achieved by a woman. In 1968, U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson made her ambassador to UNESCO, a post she held until 1969 (when U.S. President Richard M. Nixon changed administration. In 1971, she became a contributor to the Washington Post and Christian Science Monitor through 1973. Personal and death On June 25, 1926, she married Walter C.

It can be induced in many ways; although it is often artificially induced, it is a natural in vivo process. A number of research deal with the development of a strategy utilizing this phenomenon in transplantation immunology. The goal is to achieve long-term tolerance of the transplant through short-term therapy.  History  The term \\"infectious tolerance\\" was originally used by Gershon and Kondo in 1970 for suppression of naive lymphocyte populations by cells with regulatory function and for the ability to transfer a state of unresponsiveness from one animal to another. Gershon and Kondo discovered that T cells can not only amplify but also diminish immune responses. The T cell population causing this down-regulation was called suppressor T cells and was intensively studied for the following years (nowadays they are called regulatory T cells and are again a very attractive for research). These and other research in the 1970s showed greater complexity of immune regulation, unfortunately these experiments were largely disregarded, as methodological difficulties prevented clear evidence. Later developed new tolerogenic strategies have provided strong evidence to re-evaluate the phenomenon of T cell mediated suppression, in particular the use of non-depleting anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies, demonstrating that neither thymus nor clonal deletion is necessary to induce tolerance. In 1989 was successfully induced classical transplantation tolerance to skin grafts in adult mice using antibodies blocking T cell coreceptors in CD4+ populations. Later was shown that the effect of monoclonal antibodies is formation of regulatory T lymphocytes. It has been shown that transfer of tolerance to other recipients can be made without further manipulation and that this tolerance transfer depends only on CD4+ T-lymphocytes. Because second-generation tolerance arises in the absence of any monoclonal antibodies to CD4 or CD8, it probably represents a natural response of the immune system, which, once initiated, becomes self-sustaining. This ensures the long duration of once induced tolerance, for as long as the donor antigens are present.  Mechanisms  Treg migrate to the grafted tissue. Activated Treg convert ATP released by inflamed tissues to adenosine via the ectoenzymes CD39 and CD73. Local adenosine could contribute to the initial “privileged” microenvironment. Treg also secrete TGF-β and IL-10 which inhibit the maturation and migration of dendritic cells (DC). These “decommissioned” DC can secrete catabolic enzymes for depletion of essential amino acids (EAA) and, therefore, induce apoptosis of effector T cells. Moreover, the “privileged” tissues could release pro-apoptotic galectin-9 which binds to TIM-3 expressed by effector T cells such as Th1 and Th17. This further amplifies the immunosuppressive microenvironment. Each of these components within the graft can further reinforce the local anti-inflammatory state such that any naive T cell, migrating into this area, will be converted to induced Treg (iTreg) through infectious tolerance. The iTreg then expand and further suppress immunity in the “privileged” microenvironment. During a tolerant state potential effector cells remain but are tightly regulated by induced antigen-specific CD4+ regulatory T cells (iTregs). Many subsets of iTregs play a part in this proces, but CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs play a key role, because they have the ability to convert conventional T cells into iTregs directly by secretion of the suppressive cytokines TGF-β, IL-10 or IL-35, or indirectly via dendritic cells (DCs). Production of IL-10 induces the formation of another population of regulatory T cells called Tr1. Tr1 cells are dependent on IL-10 and TGF-β as well as Tregs, but differ from them by lacking expression of Foxp3. High IL-10 production is characteristic for Tr1 cells themselves and they also produce TGF-β. In the presence of IL-10 can be also induced tolerogenic DCs from monocytes, whose production of IL-10 is also important for Tr1 formation. These interactions lead to the production of enzymes such as IDO (indolamine 2,3-dioxygenase) that catabolize essential amino acids. This microenvironment with a lack of essential amino acids together with other signals results in mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibition which, particularly in synergy with TGF-β, direct the induction of new FoxP3 (forkhead box protein 3) expressing Tregs.

The son of former congressman and senator Daniel Akaka, he has taught at several schools and is in charge of the Hawaiian music school Ke Kula Mele. In 2014 he successfully led a petition to prevent the ukulele from being named the official state musical instrument, arguing that the steel guitar was more reflective of Hawaiian tradition. Biography Alan Akaka was born in 1956 to Daniel Akaka, who was to become representative of Hawaii to the United States House of Representatives and United States Senate. He played clarinet in the high school band at Kamehameha Schools. Akaka was inspired to play steel guitar when he was exposed to the instrument during the Hawaiian renaissance of the early 1970s. Of particular importance was an album by the Sons of Hawaii. Attempting to imitate the sounds he heard, he requisitioned the Martin guitar belonging to his father, tuned it to slack-key, and used the barrel of his clarinet as a slide across the strings. His father, explaining that Akaka was playing steel guitar, continued to encourage his musical endeavors. Akaka graduated from the University of Hawaii with a degree in Music Education. From 1979 until 1985 he worked with as a performer at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel in conjunction with Jerry Byrd, Tihati's Royal Hawaiian Troupe, and the Leina'ala Simerson Serenaders. He also performed at the Helekulani Hotel with Sonny Kamahele. He has taught at the Kamehameha Schools (including as bandmaster), Saint Louis School, Kahuku High School, and at the University of Hawaii. Motivation Encouraged by an uncle, Akaka began taking lessons in 1973 from Jerry Byrd, who had recently arrived in Hawaii. Another important influence to Akaka was Merle Kekuku (Joseph Kekuku's nephew) who instructed him to master a single tuning. He began performing with Genoa Keawe on a stand-in basis, and eventually became her primary steel guitarist. Position When Jerry Byrd retired in 1991, Akaka assumed leadership of the Steel Guitar Ho'olaule'a. In 1993, he became president of the Hawaiian Steel Guitar Association. In 2014, Akaka led a successful petition to deny the naming of the ukulele as the official State musical instrument, as he felt the steel guitar was the true native born instrument of Hawaii. He is in charge of a Hawaiian music school, Ke Kula Mele.

It established that where a person supplies a controlled drug to a fully informed and responsible adult, who dies as a result of freely and voluntarily administering that drug, the supplier cannot be guilty of manslaughter. Facts Simon Kennedy lived in a hostel along with Marco Bosque and Andrew Cody. The latter two men shared a room. On 10 September 1996, Kennedy visited the room shared by Bosque and Cody, where they were drinking. Kennedy was a supplier of heroin to Bosque. Bosque asked Kennedy for \\"a bit [of heroin] to help [him] sleep\\". Kennedy prepared a dose of heroin and gave Bosque a syringe. Bosque injected himself and returned the syringe to Kennedy, who left. Bosque stopped breathing and an ambulance was called. He was taken to hospital and pronounced dead on arrival due to asphyxia caused by pulmonary aspiration of his stomach contents while acutely intoxicated by opiates and alcohol. Kennedy was arrested and tried at the Old Bailey on 26 November 1997. He was convicted of manslaughter and supplying a Class A drug to another, and sentenced to five years' imprisonment. He appealed to the Court of Appeal of England and Wales but his appeal was dismissed on 31 July 1998. Proceedings However, on 24 February 2004 the Criminal Cases Review Commission exercised its power under the Criminal Appeal Act 1995 to refer Kennedy's conviction for manslaughter back to the Court of Appeal, where it was again dismissed. Kennedy appealed to the House of Lords. The Lords, sitting as an Appellate Committee, overturned the decision of the Court of Appeal and quashed Kennedy's conviction for manslaughter. They noted that a conviction of 'unlawful act' manslaughter (one of the two bases for manslaughter in English law, along with gross negligence) required the defendant to commit an unlawful act which was a crime and which was a significant cause of the deceased's death. The arguments in the case circled around the third point. It was agreed that Kennedy had committed the crime of supplying a controlled drug to Bosque under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. The Lords stated, approving the Court of Appeal's ruling in R v Dalby [1982] 1 WLR 425, that the act of supplying drugs alone cannot be the foundation of a charge of unlawful act manslaughter as \\"the supply itself may have caused no harm unless the deceased had subsequently used the drugs in a form and quantity which was dangerous\\". As such, the Crown Prosecution Service argued that Kennedy had committed the offence of \\"maliciously administering poison, etc., so as to endanger life or inflict grievous bodily harm\\" contrary to section 23 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 as the 'unlawful act' which was a significant cause of Bosque's death. It was argued that Kennedy had \\"administered\\" the heroin to Bosque, reading a wide interpretation of the word 'administer', by encouraging him to do so, such that he was jointly liable for Bosque having injected himself. The Lords rejected this argument, recognising that an informed choice made with free will has historically been considered a novus actus interveniens in English law and specifically in the context of preparing a heroin injection in R v Dias [2002] Cr App R 96; while Kennedy may have \\"made more likely\\" that Bosque would inject himself, he did not cause him to do it as Bosque's choice had broken the chain of causation. This meant that he had not committed the crime under section 23, and so there was no basis for the manslaughter charge. Neither was Kennedy an accomplice as Bosque had not committed an offence in injecting himself with heroin, as the Misuse of Drugs Act did not criminalise the act of injecting or otherwise administering drugs. As such, the only unlawful act committed by Kennedy was not a significant cause of Bosque's death, and no conviction of manslaughter could be reached. Accordingly, Kennedy's conviction for manslaughter was quashed.

Life St Cuthberts Church, Edinburgh as seen from Moncrieff-Wellwood's grave He was born Henry Wellwood Moncreiff at Blackford manse near Stirling on 6 February 1750, the eldest son of Catherine Wellwood and Sir William Moncreiff, Baronet, who equally had the dual claim to fame of being minister of the parish.

Early life and education Hage was born in Stege on the island of Møn, the son of merchant Christopher Friedenreich Hage and Christiane Arnette Hage bée Just (1778-1866). The Hage family was of Dutch origins and had counted merchants at least since the 17th century. Hage was the brother of Hother H. and Johannes H. (1800–37). Intended for an academic career, he stayed in the household of pastor D. P. Smith in Horslunde as part of the preparations for his further studies. Career Hage was, however, more interested in following in his father's footsteps and therefore joined his company at the age of 16. He showed a remarkable talent for the trade and already became a partner in 1828. When Hans Puggaard, who was married to Hage's elder sister, opened a branch in Nakskov in 1862, he employed Hage as its manager. Under Hage's leadership, the company ended up completely dominating the export of grain from the island of Lolland. He also contributed to significantly improving the quality by personally guiding landowners and promoting the best varieties on local exhibitions. In 1841 Hage moved to Copenhagen with his family after Puggaard had invited him to become a partner in the company. Hage contributed to increasing the export of grain to England and also established a largescale import of colonial goods. The company owned a large fleet of merchant ships. Hage became one of the most successful merchants of his day but remained an outsider for the business community in Copenhagen. Property In 1859, Hage purchased Nivaagaard and several other farms at Nivå in North Zealand. He purchased Oremandsgaard near Præstø in 1861. He was also the owner of several estates in Sweden. Hage lived at Kronprinsessegade 20 from 1843 to 1848. He then lived in a now demolished building at Torvegade until 1858. He then lived for a few years first at Ny Kongensgade 6 (1859-1860) and then Bredgade 45 (1861) before taking over the Harsdorff House on Kongens Nytorv where he lived for the rest of his life 1862-1872). Personal life Frederikke Vilhelmine Hage painted by Constantin Hansen in 1836 Hage married Frederikke Vilhelmine Faber (18 February 1810 -- 23 December 1891) on 28 August 1840 in Stege Church. He was the father of Johannes Hage (1842-1923) and Alfred Hage (1843-1922). Hage was interested in the arts. His homes in Copenhagen and in Stokkerup on the Øresund coast were frequented by writers, artists, politicians and actors. Gis three adopted daughters from his wife's first marriage were all married to prominent cultural figures. The composer Peter Heise married his daughter Ville, the sculptor Vilhelm Bissen married the daughter Johanne (Hanne) and the writer and editor Carl Ploug Frederikke Elisabeth. Hage commissioned Constantin Hansen's painting of The Danish Constituent Assembly. It hang in his home until his widow donated it to the Danish state. Hage died on 5 March. He is buried at Holmens Cemetery in Copenhagen. Politics Hage's niece was married to Orla Lehmann and his brother Hother Hage introduced him to other National Liberal leaders. Hage made his homes available to political salons and hosted confidential meetings between leading politicians of the time. He ran as a candidate at a supplementary election in 1851 but was not elected. He was elected for the Danish parliament in Copenhagen from 1852 to 1866 and then in Roskilde from 1868 until his death. He was involved with the work for a constitution for both Denmark and Schlesvig-Holstein in 1855 and the November Constitution in 1864.

It was released on Netflix on October 20, 2017.  Plot  An unnamed getaway driver picks up a BMW E46 for a bank robbery. En route to pick up the crew, he receives a call from his 13-year-old daughter Katie, and is unable to reach Clay, an associate who arranged the robbery. Driving the crew to the bank, the driver refuses to reveal his name, referring to himself as the “Wheelman”. As the crew carry out the robbery, Wheelman receives a call from the \\"Handler\\" who apparently contracted the crew, instructing him to abandon the men once they place the money in the trunk, as they have been ordered to kill him at the drop-off. The Handler warns Wheelman not to answer any calls but his, and Wheelman drives off with the money, leaving the crew behind. On the Handler’s instructions, Wheelman counts the stolen $230,000, unknowingly tailed by a motorcyclist. Wheelman ignores repeated calls and menacing texts from an unknown number. Clay calls, and Wheelman accuses him of arranging a set-up. The Handler gives Wheelman a location to bring the money, but Wheelman realizes the hand-off is a drug deal and flees. He calls Clay, demanding to be let out of the job, but Clay threatens to tell the Handler that Wheelman has stolen the money. Realizing he is being followed by the motorcyclist, Wheelman receives an angry voicemail from his ex-wife Jessica, Katie’s mother. The Handler calls, threatening Wheelman for disobeying him, and the motorcyclist shoots at Wheelman, who manages to outmaneuver him and escape. Finding Clay and forcing him into the car at gunpoint, Wheelman answers a call from the unknown caller, who accuses them of double-crossing him. Another driver shoots at them but they escape, and Clay admits that he arranged the robbery for the head of the West Philadelphia gang, but was paid by a new leader of the Philadelphia crime family to steal the money for him instead. The Handler is actually the Philly leader, while the unknown caller is the West End leader. Wheelman decides to go the West End gang, to whom he is indebted for protecting his family while he was in prison. He urges Clay to leave town, but Clay, fearing he will eventually be killed anyway, pulls out a gun and shoots himself in the head. The Philly leader calls, threatening to harm Jessica and Katie. Wheelman calls Katie, telling her to meet him at a parking garage. He calls Jessica to warn her, but hears her being abducted. The West End leader calls and agrees to help, telling Wheelman to arrange a drop-off with the Philly leader so the West End leader can kill him. Wheelman does so, and is attacked by a Philly gang member, but manages to kill him. After discovering a tracking device in one of the bags of money, Wheelman takes the money and sets the car on fire. He meets Katie, who drove his 1973 Porsche 911 Carrera RS to the garage, and tells her to go to her uncle's house and wait for her mother's call. Instead, Katie follows him to the top floor and watches as he confronts the Philly gang. Jessica is handed over, and Wheelman distracts the gang with a molotov cocktail. Jessica escapes, and Katie picks up her father. Taking the wheel, he leads the Philly gang into an ambush by the West End gang, and the Philly leader is executed by the West End leader. Wheelman hands over the money, and departs with Katie. They arrive at a restaurant where Jessica is waiting, and Wheelman watches as she and Katie embrace.

D.R. Khobragade belonged to Mahar caste fom Nagbhid village of Chandrapur district, Maharashtra. Around 1983, Khobragade noticed a plant with slightly different appearance and yellowish seeds in his field planted with the 'Patel 3' variety of paddy, which he experimented on in the years to come. The new variety was found giving high yields compared to the varieties available at that time. By 1990, the variety was given a name HMT. Despite his innovation, Khobragade lived a poor and mostly neglected life. He got some media attention when Forbes magazine named him among seven most powerful entrepreneurs of India in 2010. He first shot to fame when he accused the state-run Punjabrao Krishi Vidyapeeth (PKV) for taking credit for the brand that he had originally bred on his farm and given to the university scientists in 1994. While Dadaji claimed the PKV had appropriated his variety, the PKV held that sourced it from him and significantly improved the variety with their scientific inputs. The issue remains unresolved till date. PKV never officially gave Dadaji his credit in its varietal release proposal. The National Innovation Foundation (NIF) recognised his work in 2003-04 and the Maharashtra government gave him the Krishi Bhushan and Krishi Ratna awards for his innovations.

Deluxe Nirodh) is the first condom brand produced in India. Introduced in 1968, the condom is credited with the success of the family planning and birth control campaign in the country. From 2.40% in 1964, India's population growth rate dropped to 1.80% by 2005 with the help of Nirodh. As of 2015, population growth rate of India was 1.26%. The condom is manufactured by HLL Lifecare, a Government of India PSU healthcare products manufacturing company based in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala. With 17% market share, Nirodh is the largest selling condom in India. History Condoms have been available in India since the 1940s. By 1968 India had only one million condoms available in the market to serve a population of 470 million people (as of the 1964 census). With each condom selling at , the cost of condoms in India was almost the same as in the United States. The population growth rate was highest among the low income group, which could not afford to purchase condoms. A team from the Indian Institutes of Management recommended to the Government that they make condoms available to the Indian public at affordable prices. It was recommended that India import condoms and sell them at , one- fifth of the market price at the time per condom. 400 million condoms were therefore imported from the US, Japan and Korea in 1968. All of the condoms had identical packaging, with three condoms per packet, and were branded as Nirodh. =Branding and naming= In 1963, India's first mass-distributed condom was introduced. It was initially given the name of \\"Kamaraj\\" (pseudonym of Indian cupid Kamadeva), but K. Kamaraj was then the president of the ruling party, Indian National Congress, so a new name for the condom was chosen: \\"Nirodh\\", meaning \\"protection\\" in Hindi. =Plant and production= In 1966, Hindustan Latex (now called HLL Lifecare) was established in technical collaboration with Okamoto Industries of Japan. Operations of the first plant commenced on 5 April 1969 in Peroorkada, Thiruvananthapuram, with an annual production of 144 million condoms. In seven years the production had doubled to 288 million, and by 1985 another manufacturing plant was started in Belgaum, taking combined production capacity to 800 million condoms per year. As of 2007, HLL Lifecare produced largest variety of condoms in the world. Marketing and distribution In September 1968, a distribution scheme for Nirodh was launched to create large scale demand for the condom. Distribution was done through three schemes: #Commercial distribution: This scheme was based on the principle that family planning in India can be promoted effectively by commercial distribution. Using modern marketing techniques such as newspaper & magazines, radio, television, movie theater, billboard and printed materials, Nirodh was promoted as a consumer product. Nirodh was made easily accessible to the public by a large number of retail outlets, and was sold at prices subsidized by the Government of India. #Free supply: Under the free supply scheme, Nirodh was distributed for free at Family Planning centers to interested couples. During the field trips, health workers also distributed free Nirodhs. For HIV/AIDS prevention, Nirodh is procured by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and distributed for free by National AIDS Control Organisation using several centers formed by World Health Organization. #Depot holders: Introduced in 1969, under this scheme Nirodh was supplied to rural post offices for free. Post offices were allowed to sell Nirodh at very low prices and retain earnings as incentive.

It is known from the type and only known species, S. indicus. Shringasaurus is known from the Denwa Formation in the state of Madhya Pradesh. Shringasaurus was an allokotosaur, a group of unusual herbivorous reptiles from the Triassic, and is most closely related to the smaller and better known Azendohsaurus in the family Azendohsauridae. Like some ceratopsid dinosaurs, Shringasaurus had two large horns over its eyes that faced up and forwards from its skull. These horns were likely used for display, and possibly during fights with other Shringasaurus, much like what has been suggested for the horns of ceratopsids like Triceratops. Shringsaurus also bears similarities to sauropodomorph dinosaurs, such as its long neck and teeth, and likely occupied a similar ecological niche as a large browsing herbivore before they had evolved. Description Skeletal restoration and various bones of Shringasaurus. Shringasaurus was a large-bodied quadruped, with an estimated body length of long. Its closely resembles the related Azendohsaurus, with a small, boxy head on a long neck and a large, barrel-shaped body with deep shoulders and ribs, sprawled to semi-sprawled limbs and a short tail. Aside from being notably larger than Azendohsaurus, Shringasaurus is most recognisable for its long curving brow horns, as well as having a proportionately shorter and thicker neck than other azendohsaurids with much taller neural spines in the neck and over the shoulders. =Skull= The skull of Shringasaurus is not completely known, but what's preserved indicates that the skull was small and boxy, with a short, deep snout with rounded jaw tips and bony nostrils fused into a single, confluent opening at the front of the snout. This is broadly similar to the completely known skull of Azendohsaurus, however the lower jaw of Shringasaurus has a more conspicuous taper towards the tip compared to the deep, down-turned dentary of Azendohsaurus. The horns of Shringasaurus closely resemble those seen in ceratopsid dinosaurs, despite being totally unrelated to each other. The horns are attached to the frontal bones on the roof of the skull over the eyes, and sit across almost the entire breadth of the skull. These horns are pointed up and curve forwards from the skull, with slight variation in size and orientation between large individuals. Smaller and younger individuals had smaller, more gracile horns, indicating that the horns did not fully develop until the animals were mature. Intriguingly, at least one small specimen lacks horns entirely, whereas another similarly small specimen has small but well developed horns. It is suggested then that Shringasaurus was sexually dimorphic, and that possibly the females lacked horns. The horns themselves have a rough, grooved texture that implies they were covered with a keratinous sheath of horn in life, also like ceratopsid horns, and so would have likely been longer than the bony cores indicate. The bones of the skull beneath the horns are unusually thick, and in the larger individuals the bones of roof of the skull (the nasal, prefrontal, frontal and postfrontal) are fused together on each side. Life restoration The teeth of Shringasaurus are low and leaf-shaped (lanceolate) with large denticles on either side, similar in shape to those of Azendohsaurus but lacking the prominent expansion above the root, like the teeth of Pamelaria. Because the skull and jaws are incompletely known, the total tooth count of Shringasaurus is unknown, but like Azendohsaurus it had four teeth in each premaxilla. Shringasaurus also had numerous palatal teeth (though known only from the vomer thus far), and like Azendohsaurus they are uniquely as well developed as the marginal teeth along the edge of the jaw. Like them, they were leaf-shaped and serrated, but in Shringasaurus the palatal teeth are even more lanceolate than the marginal rows. Such palatal teeth are unusual, as most other herbivorous reptiles with them have much simpler, domed palatal teeth, and palatal teeth identical to those of the jaw margins are otherwise only found in the related allokotosaurs Azendohsaurus and Teraterpeton. =Skeleton= Femur, tibia and fibula of Shringasaurus. The vertebral column is well known in Shringasaurus, including the whole cervical series, various dorsal vertebrae, both sacral vertebrae and some caudal vertebrae. Like other azendohsaurids, the first-through-middle cervical vertebrae are characteristically elongated, giving Shringasaurus a long, raised neck, although it is proportionately shorter than in Azendohsaurus and Pamelaria. The neck is also much taller than in other azendohsaurids, with tall, prominent neural spines. This trend continues into the dorsals of the back, which although are not as long as the cervicals have neural spines twice the height of their centra. The 2nd–5th cervicals of Shringasaurus sport prominent epipophyses, structures for supporting neck musculature, suggesting Shringasaurus had strong neck muscles. The first twelve dorsals are also marked by various well-defined laminae that bound deep fossae (depressions in the bone), similar to those found on the vertebrae of sauropods. Like Azendohsaurus, Shringasaurus has two sacral vertebrae with well-developed ribs that articulate with the ilia. The shoulder and forelimb are broadly similar to those of Azendohsaurus, with a tall scapula that is concave along the front with an expanded tip, and an interclavicle with a long paddle-like process on the back and a short forward-pointing process (an unusual feature for archosauromorphs but also found in Azendohsaurus). The coracoid articulates with the scapula to form a glenoid (shoulder socket) that faces out to the sides and back, a feature in Azendohsaurus suggested to indicate the forelimb was held more upright than a full sprawl. The humerus is likewise similar, with broad ends and a narrow midshaft, and a very well-developed deltopectoral crest half as long as the whole bone, indicating powerful forelimbs. The ulna, however, can be distinguished by a lower olecranon process below the elbow than in Azendohsaurus. The hips and hind limbs are very similar to those of Azendohsaurus. The ilium has a prominent, semi-circular process at the front while the rear process is longer and thinner, and the acetabulum (hip socket) is also solid, unlike the perforated hip socket of dinosaurs. The femur is robust and slightly s-shaped, held out to the sides in a sprawl, with a robust tibia and a fibula only half as wide in the lower leg. The foot is typical for early archosauromorphs, including Azendohsaurus. Discovery and naming Maps detailing the location of the Shringasaurus bone bed. Shringasaurus is known from a single bone bed of fossils in the upper Denwa Formation, India. The formation is part of the Satpura Gondwana Basin, located in the Hoshangabad district in the state of Madhya Pradesh. The precise age of the Denwa Formation is not known, but vertebrate biostratigraphy has been used to narrow it down to a range in the early Middle Triassic with conflicting opinions on an early or late Anisian age. The upper Denwa Formation is characteristically dominated by red mudstones with ribbon-shaped sandstone sheets encased within them. The Shringasaurus bone bed consists of mostly disarticulated bones scattered in a area of red mudstone, although one skeleton was found partially articulated, and only contains fossils of Shringasaurus. At least seven to eight individuals were recovered from the bone bed, based on the number of different left humeri, skull roofs and horns discovered, and they are all from varying ontogenetic stages of growth with a wide range of body sizes. Of these individuals, only one or two lacked horns, and it's suggested that the bone bed was taphonomically biased towards the heavier, solidly built skulls of horned individuals while being transported and preserved. The fossils were excavated and prepared by Professor Saswati Bandyopadhyay, Dhurjati Sengupta and Shiladri Das of the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, where the fossils are also stored. It was then described and named in August 2017 by Sarandee Sengupta and Bandyopadhyay, as well as by Martín D. Ezcurra of the Bernardino Rivadavia Natural Sciences Argentine Museum in Argentina. The holotype specimen, ISIR 780, consists of a partial skull roof including the prefrontal, frontal, postfrontal and parietal bones, along with a pair of large supra-orbital horns. The various other specimens from the bone bed have been designated as paratypes and consist of multiple cranial and postcranial bones from much of the skeleton. The genus was named using the ancient Sanskrit word for \\"horn\\", 'Śṛṅga' (शृङ्ग), for the unique horns on its skull, combined with the Ancient Greek σαῦρος (sauros) for \\"lizard\\". The species name indicus is Latin for \\"Indian\\", to refer to its country of discovery. Classification Shringasaurus is recognised as a member of the family Azendohsauridae, and as the closest relative of Azendohsaurus itself. The family is typically grouped within the recently recognised clade Allokotosauria, along with the trilophosaurids, as was recovered by Sengupta and colleagues when they described Shringasaurus and analysed its phylogenetic relationships in 2017. Another analysis of archosauromorph relationships in 2019 that used a different dataset from Sengupta et al. (2017)—that of Pritchard et al. (2018)—was updated to include Shringasaurus, and similarly recovered it and Azendohsaurus as each other's closest relatives within Allokotosauria, further supporting an azendohsaurid affinity for Shringasaurus. The results found by Sengupta and colleagues in 2017 is shown below as an excerpt of the full cladogram, simplified and focused on the relationships of Shringasaurus to other allokotosaurs: Skull diagram of Azendohsaurus, the closest relative of Shringasauris. Shringasaurus and other azendohsaurids share several features, including confluent nares, leaf-shaped teeth and a long neck, as well as a few other minor details of the skeleton. It is particularly similar to Azendohsaurus in features of the pareitals, the lower jaw, shoulder, hip, femur and vertebrae, but can be distinguished by teeth that are not expanded above the roots, the lack of a groove on the inside surface of the maxilla, tall neural spines, and of course the horns. Palaeobiology Reconstruction of the skull and horns compared to that of the ceratopsid dinosaur Arrhinoceratops, and a comparison of various horns from different sized individuals, including a possibly female hornless specimen. =Function of the horns= The horns of Shringasaurus are its most prominent feature, and so some focus was placed on their role and function in its initial description. Its describers considered its horns to be likely products of sexual selection, not primarily for defence or species recognition (as has been proposed for the head ornaments of dinosaurs). The horns grow notably larger and more robust in large adults, while smaller individuals have shorter and more graceful horns. The possibility that Shringasaurus was sexually dimorphic, with probable females lacking horns, further supports this interpretation. This would be similar to modern horned bovids, but unlike ceratopsid dinosaurs, and indeed other archosauromoromorphs, which do not appear to have been dimorphic. Furthermore, the size and shape of the horns has been compared to those of other horned animals, and the relatively short, curved horns were most similar to those of animals that wrestle with their horns, as opposed to ramming, stabbing and fencing. Male Shringasaurus then may have competed for mates by locking their horns together, remarkably similar to what is inferred for the horned ceratopsid dinosaurs (particularly Triceratops) and the modern reedbuck antelope. =Palaeopathology= One specimen of Shringasaurus is known to have had a pair of malformed vertebrae in its neck. The two cervicals are partially fused together, interpreted as either the result of a birth defect, spondyloarthropathy (a type of arthritis), or possibly a bacterial or fungal disc infection. The vertebrae belonged to a large adult animal, so it is unlikely that the quality of life for the individual was severely affected by the disorder, and it was probably not fatal to the animal. One of the vertebrae also preserves a healed fracture, although the cause for this injury is unknown. Palaeoecology In the upper Denwa Formation, Shringasaurus coexisted with the lungfish Ceratodus sp. and a variety of temnospondyl amphibians, including the capitosaurid Paracyclotosaurus crookshanki, the mastodonsaurid Cherninia denwai, a lonchorhynchine trematosaurid, and a brachyopid. Other terrestrial vertebrates include a large undescribed rhynchosaur and two species of dicynodonts, a mid- sized species similar to Kannemeyeria and a larger species interpreted as similar to Stahleckeria. The environment is interpreted as representing a dry, semi-arid floodplain with slow moving, anabranching rivers that periodically burst their banks. Rainfall was seasonal, and the environment experienced droughts that dried up ephemeral rivers and ponds. The large body size of Shringasaurus and its similarity to sauropodomorphs—including its jaws and teeth as well as a superficially similar body shape—suggests that it occupied the role of a large, relatively high-browsing herbivore in its environment, similar to what is suggested for Azendohsaurus.

They had decided from the beginning to avoid confining themselves to a specific genre and when pressed by interviewers to define their style, they responded with the term, \\"Hermetic Death Rock.\\" History =Early years (2007–2010)= The band released their first effort, A Wolf's Age, in 2010 with former bass player Steve Matthews (Argyle Goolsby). Steve joined the duo and wrote the song, \\"Closed Casket Heart\\", which was subsequently added as the last track for the album and contributed to backing vocals. After the recording sessions, they went separate ways after the band realized they had differing ideas for the future and for the direction of the music. A Wolf's Age was discontinued and deleted from the band's catalogue in January 2015. =First works (2010–2014)= In 2010, Smoke in the Sky was shortly released after A Wolf's Age with an accompanying live album, Live. July 17th 2010. Unity, MA. Smoke in the Sky was a clear departure from their first effort and was described as gloomy and subdued, much like Mark Lanegan's early work. In 2012, Wildwood was released along with a sister EP, The Nightside. The theme of the album was a general commentary on the concept of human nature and predominantly used nature-based imagery throughout the album artwork. The music itself combined European folk, '70s prog, and metal influences to create a dark and cinematic experience that evokes the occult aspects of historical New England. In 2014, the band ventured into soundtrack work with Edgar Allan Poe: A Life of Hope & Despair. The album was used as a neoclassical and experimental soundtrack to an Edgar Allan Poe based art show in Salem, Massachusetts. A Life of Hope & Despair explored the melancholic and quaint life, love, and death of Edgar Allan Poe himself that you can feel as the album progresses. =Prophecy Productions (2016)= In 2016, Prophecy Productions signed 1476, heralding them as \\"America's best kept secret in the realm of dark, atmospheric Art Rock\\" and gained the attention of media outlets around the world proclaiming, \\"Prophecy Productions has found a golden nugget with 1476.\\". In preparation of the band's upcoming release, Our Season Draws Near, Prophecy reissued 1476's entire back-catalogue and released their first available vinyl, the Wildwood / The Nightside reissue. Wildwood / The Nightside was met with critical acclaim and was \\"recommended to all those wanting to discover this rare and precious duo, between strange neofolk and melancholy post-punk\\". The reissued albums from Prophecy brought 1476 out of the underground and they gained popularity for their unique sound. \\"It's a fortune be aware of groups like the 1476 because the challenge to be original and coherent is not always easy but they succeed in an exemplary manner.\\" =Our Season Draws Near (2017)= In 2017, the band released Our Season Draws Near, their first album with Prophecy Productions. It uses a strong winter theme that captures the dreary, haunting and foreboding atmospheres of coastal New England. It is their heaviest sounding album to date that showcases raw, honest, and personal emotions that are dedicated to solitude and its lessons. Our Season Draws Near received exceptional praise, being called \\"a wild-card folk/atmospheric metal force\\" while the album is hailed as, \\"a record that can't help but to keep you in a constant state of thrall\\". It was produced by the band and mixed by Markus Siegenhort from the post-black metal driving force Lantlôs. 1476 assembled their first touring lineup in 2017. Name origin \\"1476\\" is in specific reference to a song previously written by its founder, Robb Kavjian, but chosen for its overall ambiguity that allows the band musical freedom. The nature of the name being a year is that it predates the founding of America and implies a European origin. \\"The past is important to us because it is completely subjective. It allows the imagination to truly dream. All we have are fragments of words and images from the past collected and recorded by people subjectively. There's something very compelling about this for me—to reach into these fragmented images from the past and to reconstruct them subjectively. There is something dreamlike and \\"lost in time\\" about it which is something I always want to capture musically.\\" Musical style The music of 1476 structurally combines elements of folk and black metal, moody indie rock, neo-folk, neoclassical, and post-punk. The nature of their music is largely dictated by the concept and theme of their albums. Prophecy Productions describes their own as, \\"isolationist sound stories: musically and attitudinally coming from a punk/DIY background, they arguably absorbed all genres of guitar-heavy and atmospheric music there ever was since—including sub-genres of metal, neofolk, and ambient.\\" Others have said their music captures the essence of New England's 'aura' or character and that the two-piece band reinvents itself with each release. 1476 has been compared to sonically akin to bands such as Agalloch, Ulver, or Amebix that share a background in making their own way in creating heavy, dark, and atmospheric music that is enhanced by rich esoteric/spiritual concepts.

The service provides detailed maps of the whole world. It includes a search, information about traffic jams, routing and street panoramas. The service was launched in 2004. Yandex.Maps is the most popular cartographic service in Russia. It has about 11.5 million users in Russia per month, and over 20 million worldwide. Features The service initially had maps only of Russia and Ukraine, but now includes world maps. Maps are available in four versions: maps, satellite images, satellite images with captions, and legend (hybrid). Users can measure distance and get directions by dragging between spots on a map. The search is available by both geographical objects (addresses, streets, cities, regions and countries) and by organizations. The illumination of the district, city or region is available after searching the organization on the site. Yandex.Maps has a mobile application for iOS, Android and Windows phones. = Street view = Car, shooting panoramas for Yandex.Maps On Yandex.Maps it is possible to view street panoramas. There are street view even of Pripyat and Chernobyl. In 2016 a \\"street view\\" of Everest was photographed. = Map editor = Users can make new data on the map with the help of the Yandex.Map editor. In geographies where it is hard to find providers of good map data, user contributions could be used to increase map quality. Any registered Yandex user can edit the map through a simple web editor pending edit moderation. In the editor there are five special modes for drawing objects: * Scaling and rotation - to rotate objects around their axis and reduce / increase the size. * Angle alignment - makes it easy to draw objects with most corners straight. * Rounding corners - simplifies the drawing of roads and rivers, rounding their corners. * Adhesion - the boundaries of the contours of objects of the same category are joined in one line. * Cutting - helps draw buildings with adjacent borders, as well as high- rise buildings The editing interface also allows for additional data to be added to certain categories of objects, such as the height of buildings, the direction of traffic at the roads, hours of operation, phone numbers etc. Yandex.Traffic Yandex.Traffic is a feature on Yandex.Maps that displays traffic conditions in real time on major roads and highways. It can be viewed at the Yandex.Maps website, or via the app. Yandex.Traffic works by analyzing the GPS-determined locations transmitted to Yandex by a large number of mobile phone users. By calculating the speed of users along a length of road, Yandex is able to generate a live traffic map. It processes the incoming raw data about mobile phone device locations, and then excludes anomalies such as a postal vehicle that makes frequent stops. When a threshold of users in a particular area is noted, the overlay along roads and highways on the map changes color.

Buechel, Eugene & Manhart S.J., Paul Lakota Dictionary: Lakota-English / English-Lakota, New Comprehensive Edition 2002. It surrounds the worship of a pantheon of deities, who are related in a similarly derivative manner from one another as the Christian god is often related to Jesus and the Holy Spirit. These spirits are known collectively as the Wakantanka (wah-kaw-taw-kah), or the Great Mystery. All of the spirits in general are called the Wakan. Up to the late 19th century, much of the edicts surrounding the religion were considered taboo to speak of to outsiders. The Wicasa Wakan (Wee-chah-shuh wah-kaw), or Shamans/ Holy Men, made an exception with a Caucasian man named James Walker. Among the Lakota POWs in the Dakotas, they put him through the rites to become one of them and passing on much of their knowledge in the hopes that it could be preserved and one day returned to the Siouan people. He wrote all he learned down in 3 books, Lakota Myth, Lakota Society, and Lakota Beliefs & Ritual, but much of what he was taught was often confused, contradictory and muddled. Other holy men continued to pass down important knowledge to their own children. Other things were recorded through happenstance by a missionary named Eugene Buechel around the turn of the 20th century, who created the groundwork for the Lakota Dictionary. Some of this knowledge may not be complete or accurate. It is also important to note that there are different variants, or sects, of this religion, by tribe and culture. This article mainly covers the Lakota/ Dakota version, which is nearly identical to the Assiniboine version. Other wildly different interpretations include the Ho- chunk version, the Dhegihan/Chiwere version and the Eastern Siouan version once practiced by tribes on the east coast. Since there are unknown cultures, like the Fort Ancients, there may have once been even further derivatives. Wakantanka The pantheon consists of a series of 16 deities. These beings are divided into sets of two, whose powers complement one another to create the known world. They are as follows: * Skan-skan/Takuskanskan (Shkaw-shkaw) - God of sky & time. Also known as the Great Judge & Mediator. * Omaka / Unci (Uh-chee) - Goddess of the Earth & seas * Inyan (Ih-yaw) - God of the Mountains * Wakinyan (wah-kih-yaw) - The Thunderbird/ Storm God * Tate (Tah- teh) - Wind God * Yumni (Yoo-muh-nee) - Whirlwind/Cyclone God. Also commonly referred to as the God of Love for the role he plays in creation myths. * Okaga - The south wind * Yata - the north wind * Yunpa (yuh-bah) - the east wind * Eya - the west wind * Wazi - The first man/the Wizard * Wakanka - the first woman/the Witch * Wi (wee) - the sun god * Hanwi (haw-wee) - the moon goddess * Unk (uhk) - Dark Goddess of Passion & Discord * Gnaski (Guh-nah-suh- kee) - Dark God of lies. aka the Crazy BuffaloJahner, Elaine A. & DeMallie, Raymond J. Lakota Myth 2006. =The Wakan= There are also a variety of other spiritual aids in the world. They are as follows. * Canotila (Chaw-oh-dee-lah) - The Little People who dwell in the trees. They protect the forests, are commonly portrayed as tricksters & send men important messages in their dreams. * Wakinyan- Different from the Thunderbird, they are the spirits of the air who help the Thunderbird move the storms in the sky. * Unktehi (Uh- kuh-teh-hee) - Spirits of the water & teachers & guides in sacred artwork & tattooing. They are commonly described as being something along the line of a Buffalo or Goat with a long tail, but certain stories give them odd characteristics such as a thick, brittle tail & backward horns that sound more like giant, clawless Crawfish or lobsters. * Unkcegila (Uh-kuh-cheh-ghee-lah) - Draconic spirits of the land. They are responsible for natural disasters and the fertility of the land. In legend, they were supposedly formed from the wrath of Unk when she was tossed into the sea, and so much of Walkers' work often confuses Unktehi & Unkcegila. They are the mortal enemies of the Thunderbird and it is said that fossils are the result of the battles between the two. * Tatanka (tah-taw-kah) - The spirits who protect the Buffalos. * Hohnogica - Spirits of the home & hearth. * Wanagi (wah-nah-ghee) - The souls of the dead still trapped in the human world. They take the form of disembodied shadows. * Tunkan (Tuh-kaw) - Spirits of the rocks. They are said to play a major role in the sweat lodge ceremonies. Other specific beings from the mythology are as follows. * Wohpe (Woh-huh-beh) - aka the White Buffalo Calf Woman. In the mythology, Tate was once the mediator for Skanskan, but forsook this role for a mortal woman named Ite. In his place, Skan created a feminine being called Wohpe, the Fallen Star Goddess. She plays a major role in the spiritual beliefs in a similar fashion to the angel Gabriel in Christianity & brought many of the oldest rituals to the Siouan people, including the Peace Pipe. * Iya/ Waziya - The giant winter god. Using the imagery of the first man, Wazi, they also created a form in the mythology called Waziya that is supposed to resemble a common Amerindian personification—old man winter. He lives in the Aurora Borealis and looses winter on the world, then gathers it back up and returns it to the north in spring. Waziya is also a common euphemism for Santa Claus. * Anung-Ite (Ah- nuhk ee-teh) - The two-faced woman. Originally Ite, the daughter of Wazi & Kakanka, she was tricked into upsetting Hanwi by trying to seduce the sun. For her transgression, she was banished into the world and merged with part of Unk to become a murderous monster called Anung-Ite, however, Tate still did not leave her and brought his family to live in the early world with her. She may be considered a direct ancestor to all men. * Iktomi (ee-kuh-toh-mee) - The God of Wisdom/ the Trickster/ the spider. He was born of the powers of Inyan & Wakinyan to keep them company, but came into an odd, crippled form (as wisdom often comes in strange ways). Still, he wished to be helpful and become a close friend & ally to Skanskan, who brought him to his position as a god of wisdom. However, he came to be tricked by Gnaski & reprimanded by Tate, infuriating him. In his attempts to get even by tricking Ite into falling for Wi instead of Tate, he was cast out and became the trickster spirit. Now, he only teaches wisdom through playing tricks on those who live without it, convincing them to embrace it on their own. * To Win (Tow whih) - The Blue Woman who guards the road to the afterlife. Every act in one's life marks one's spirit with \\"tattoos\\" that the To Win can read. She is encountered on the Spirit Road (seen as the center of the Milky Way in the sky) and throws spirits back to earth if they aren't prepared for the next life. To Win is most likely a play on the Siouan word for aunt, Tonwin.Sharon Lee, Annette & Rock, Jim Dakota/Lakota Star Map Constellation Guidebook: An Introduction to D(L)akota Star Knowledge 2014. * Heyoka - The thunderbird, Wakinyan, usually has many tricks to conceal himself from others. Any man said to see him is believed to be rendered insane & becomes his slave. These are the Heyoka, often translated as Clowns, who wear moccasins with mismatched or non- patterned beadwork, a thick cape & literally nothing else. This word is also a common euphemism for, not just the insane, but anyone who is odd or does or thinks anything antithetical to the greater society. Such people were usually recruited to be Wicasa Wakan, Holy Men. Mythological origins The Siouan mythology concerning their Religious origin stories are the main issue with Walker's work. It was made & kept mostly by the Shamans who saw it only as a useful teaching method rather than a true story, thus much of it is contradictory & has no useful or meaningful chronology. It is likely that it had once been conceived as a complete narrative, was split into smaller chunks in order to ensure accuracy in the teachings &, over time, each piece may have been embellished to better stand on its own. However, a general story can be assembled from it. In the beginning, there was only one god, the Wakantanka, and he was all of existence, fixed in place and lonely. One day, he resolved to create other beings of power for him to act upon and talk to and bled away his power, causing him to split into three deities—The Rock, the Earth & the Sky. As these beings began coming to their own sentience, they took on their own personalities and began communing with one another, learning from these interactions as children would. They soon saw flaws to their existence and began creating more and more beings and things to fill the spaces between them, creating the laws of nature as they went along, however, their work expended beyond their ability to control. In this, they not only created other gods, but mortal beings and accidentally brought evil into the world. Since the goddess of passion, Unk, was just as powerful as any of them, they couldn't recall her from existing and had to create new things to give to mortals in order to combat her—such as spiritual power and medicine. In this, the first mortals, the Pte Oyate (Buffalo People) came into being in a great cave in the womb of the earth. Iktomi, the Trickster, was disgraced by Gnaski, son of Unk, & chose to get revenge on Tate for his harsh treatment in the aftermath. Wazi & Wakanka, the spiritual leaders of the Pte Oyate & parents of Tate's wife Ite, are convinced by Iktomi to cause their daughter to fall in love with the sun god Wi and take the place of the moon. Somehow, he does this before Ite exists, even though she already existed as Tate's wife before. Ite is cursed to become Anung-Ite, & she, Wazi & Wakanka are banished to the surface of the earth to wander forever. Iktomi is also cursed and disgraced from godhood & Tate comes to live on the surface of the earth, with his five sons—Yata, Yunpa, Okaga, Eya & Yumni. Wohpe is sent to earth to help Tate & his sons forge the world as people know it. The four adult sons would go out into the world to mark out the four directions and help Skanskan create time & space. Tate is so surprised, and pleased, to meet his replacement that he asks her to live with him as his adoptive daughter & take care of his youngest son, Yumni. However, the brothers all fall for her and wish her to be their wife. Not possessed of an ability to love, she shuns all of them, going to far as to use magic to curse them should they ever break with her wishes. Two of the brothers concede. However, on their journey, they are tricked by Wazi, Wakanka & Iktomi at various points, which drives them into conflict. Wohpe soon begins to feel that she cannot avoid becoming the wife of one of the brothers and asks Yumni which she should choose, and he drives her into the arms of his favorite big brother, Okaga. Upon the return of the four brothers, Tate holds a great feast for the gods to celebrate the works of his sons. During this feast, Tate gives magical gifts to all the attendees, however, Iktomi, still sore, uses his powers to ruin most of them. Then, Okaga and Wohpe marry. Unfortunately, this infuriates Yata and the two fall to violent arguments that push all five brothers apart, with Yumni & Tate caught in the middle. Yata tries multiple times to rape Wohpe, and she uses her magic to escape by shrinking and hiding under her dress, but goes to far with it, she cannot escape her own spell. It is afterward that the four directions move to the corners of the earth, never to speak again & Yumni becomes the whirlwind god, constantly forced to move between them in order to keep in touch with his brothers. Further stories put together certain ideological points and the origins of other aspects of Lakota life & the natural world after this. Eventually, the humans meet the Pte Oyate once again on the surface of the earth and form a close interdependence with them that lasts forever. All of this is mainly supposed to point out one thing in particular—the importance of exercising wisdom in decision making. Wisdom is defined as the ability to predict the consequences of one's actions and those of others, and to understand what is coming before it happens. For, not even the gods or early Siouan ancestors were born with it, but it could have prevented all of this tragedy. The Dead Siouan people buried the dead in specified burial grounds, usually consisting of a buried grave marked with a pile of rocks. They may have also, at times, participated in sky burials, or leaving the dead upon a scaffold in a sacred place.https://archive.org/details/bureauofethnology00thomrich In Siouan mythology the dead pass through the reflections on the water to enter the spirit world, which is reflected in the sky. It is believed that the stars—known as Wi Can (wee chaw. Branching lights)-- are the souls of the dead and it is passed down that they paint pictures in the sky to resemble things on the earth in order to send their children messages. Supposedly, this is what led the Lakota to settle in the Black Hills region. Cangleska Pejuta The most important religious symbol in Wocekiye is known as the Cangleska Pejuta (chaw-guh-reh-shkah peh-zhoo-duh), also known as the Medicine Wheel. It is represented as a circle divided into four by a cross or X and decorated with the colors red, yellow, black & white. Its use is widespread due to the wide variety in its symbolism. * Represents the four stages of life * Represents the four main edicts of the Siouan people; wisdom, fortitude, gratitude & respect * Represents the 16 arch deities (when thought of as a sphere) with two gods at north, south, east, west, above & below respectively & the cross representing the four winds. * Represents that all life comes from Wakantanka and can only go back to him in the end. * Represents the four directionshttps://www.nlm.nih.gov/nativevoices/exhibition/healing- ways/medicine-ways/medicine-wheel.htmlhttp://medicinewheel.com/ The Three Types of Holy Men There are three distinct groups of holy men. * Wicasa Wakan - The Shamans. Their main concern is conducting regular public & private religious ceremonies, recording tribal history & keeping the time. They do this by counting the 13 full moons of the year and referencing that with weather patterns & bird song. Many native people would make little rhymes out of the songs of different birds from different times of the year telling what kinds of things happened in the natural world during that time, so they wouldn't forget. The Wicasa Wakan would be marked with a hat made from the scalp of a buffalo, horns and all, commonly referred to as a Brown Bonnet. * Pejuta Wicasa - The Medicine Men. These people were the healers & physicians of the native world and actually had access to pretty decent medicine. They were also believed to practice witchcraft & learned a wide variety of magic tricks in order to prove as such. Medicine & Magic were often seen as indistinguishable from one another to native peoples. Pejuta comes first in this odd case because, upon becoming a medicine man, the person is considered medicine themselves over being a human being. The Pejuta Wicasa were marked by wearing a coyote or wolf hide over their head & shoulders, commonly referred to as a Grey Bonnet. * Holy Dancers - Specific people were charged with performing certain sacred dances for different reasons throughout the year. They costumes were overly elaborate & considered holy in their own right. No one but the intended dancer was allowed to so much as touch them. Common Beliefs With Other Siouans * When one's pets die, their souls stay in this world and take care of one. When one dies, all ascend to the next world together. * Those who practice medicine must never fall prey to the belief that the power originates from them, or they will lose the power to heal forever.Neihardt, John G. & Deloria, Phillip J. Black Elk Speaks: The Complete Edition 2014. * Pointing at a rainbow is bad luck, as it is believed the tail of the Thunderbird is a rainbow & he doesn't like to be seen. * All men are born with an inherent power, called Sicun, which acts as their breath and lifeforce. It is also their conscience, connection to the Creator and their main protection to being victimized by or succumbing to evil. This also influenced a common, widespread Native American euphemism for white people, wasicun, which means \\"Powerful One.\\" * Wisdom is earned through experience and it is the duty of all men to call out those who do not fulfill it. * \\"Thunder Hears Me\\" is a common expression, usually used in place of \\"I swear to god\\" when one is making a threat or promise. Essentially, may the thunderbird strike me down is I am lying. The less intense version is \\"The Earth Hears Me.\\" * When a spirit takes a specific liking to someone, it becomes their protectorate & is referred to as a Manitukala. (word taken from Ojibwe/ Medewiwin tradition) * Beadwork is supposed to represent the stars and, therefore, the ancestors.< * Human souls trapped on the earthly plane take the form of shadows. * Medicine Pouches were often worn by different people for different purposes & often consisted of a beadworked, ornamental pouch with some kind of medicinal herb sown inside. Mothers would make pouches containing the umbilical cords of their children; Salamanders for boys & Turtles for girls. * The Man in the Moon comes from Siouan beliefs. The Winnebago, who have kept a very pure storytelling tradition, claim that it is a transgender man (teją́čowįga). It can be seen as a dress-wearing individual sitting Indian style, but wearing feathers in their hair the way a man would (off to the side) rather than how a woman would (straight up from the back.). This sentiment may have once been shared, as the Lakota word is Hanwi Hokewins'e (Effeminate Moon).http://www.hotcakencyclopedia.com/ * Reincarnation is possible. The only clear cut written reference states that the Ho-Chunk believed that spirits on the other side who were unsatisfied for whatever reason could petition the Creator to be reborn. They would be granted opportunities of seven paradises and, if they could reject them all, they would be allowed to be reborn as any one or thing they desired. Other Siouan Belief Systems =Ho-Chunk= In their version, there are seven Thunderbirds instead of one. Three are good, three are bad and one is neutral. They are each associated with a different species of real bird. They also believe in the Underwater Panther, or Water Spirit, instead of the Unkcegila. The existing literature would suggest that they originally called their spirits the Waxo, and knew the Lakota as the Wakan People. There is no equivalent being to Wohpe among the Ho-Chunk. The goddess Unk is replaced with a war God associated with comets/ falling stars and modeled for a raccoon. =Dhegihan/ Chiwere= The Dhegihans seem to have mixed their religious beliefs a great deal with that of the Caddoan People's, like the Pawnee. When the ancestors' of the Ioway, Oto and Missouria people's came to live on the same side of the river as the ancestors of the Quapaw, Osage, Omaha, Kansa and Ponca peoples, those tribes also took on many of the same divergent aspects. They believe that humans were created by the sun and descended to the earth to take physical form and live mortal lives. It is unclear if the Lakota had a similar myth. There is greater emphasis on worship of the Planet Venus than in other Siouans cultures. They believe in four Thunderbirds who represent the four directions and have an entirely different thunder spirit as the god of storms. In their medicine wheels, they replace the color yellow with either blue or green, depending on the tribe/ band. The concept of the great spirit is known as Wakanda. It would appear that the Dhegihans called the spirits the Wakan, like the Lakota did, but the Chiweres called them the Waxo, like the Ho-Chunk. Their Trickster spirit was a rabbit. Liebert, Robert M. Osage Life and Legends 1987. =Eastern Siouan= Very little is known about the Eastern Siouan variant, except for random scraps of information here and there. Some of it may have been accidentally written as Cherokee mythology instead. The genders of the sun and moon deities are reversed. They believed in one Thunderbird, like the Lakota, and seem to have believed in the Unkcegila. Their Trickster spirit was a rabbit, like the Dhegihans. Eastern Siouans originally buried their dead in Burial Mounds, but began interring them under their dwellings during the 14th century. They also observed a four day vigil and fast after burials, similar to one brought up in reference to the Ho-Chunk. The buffalo were still highly important to, at least, the Saponi, even though the animals didn't live in their lands. They are noted to have travelled to Ohio on annual hunts. Eastern Siouan medicine men wore vests made of crow feathers to mark them, instead of coyote/ wolf hides. Speck, Frank G. Catawba texts 1969. We think the Saponi-Tutelo may have called their spirits the Waho, given a pattern noted in the etymology of the names Wakan and Waxo, but there is no direct reference. =Other= Two other groups of Siouan peoples practice entirely different religions. The Tanoan-Siouan tribes-- the Crow, Hidatsa and Mandan-- seem to practice a form of the Sun Dance religion, however the Mandan also call the spirits that they worship the Maho, which is derivative of Siouan Culture. The Gulf Siouan peoples, of which the Biloxi are the only surviving member, appear to have practiced a form of Muskogean religion.

This species often lives as a commensal of another marine animal. Description At least thirty pairs of elytra, scale-like modifications to the dorsal cirri, conceal the animal's body. These are on alternate segments and do not meet dorsally, leaving the central line of the body uncovered. A. vittata is a pale yellowish colour, with a few faint transverse bands, and a dark stripe located across segments 7 and 8. It can grow to a length of but is usually shorter. It can be distinguished from the otherwise similar Arctonoe pulchra by the absence of a dark spot on each scale. Distribution A. vittata is native to the eastern Pacific Ocean. Its range extends from the Bering Strait to Ecuador, and as far west as Japan. Its depth range is from the middle shore down to about . Ecology The species forms a commensal relationship with the gumboot chiton, living on its gills. It also lives in the ambulacral groove of Dermasterias imbricata, a starfish. Another host is the keyhole limpet Diodora aspera where it lives in the gill groove. It can be very large in comparison with the size of this particular host. If the limpet is attacked by a starfish, such as Pisaster ochraceus, the scale worm defends its host by biting the tube feet of the starfish, usually succeeding in driving it away. Some other hosts have also been identified; these include the starfishes Henricia leviuscula, Luidia foliata, Pteraster tesselatus, Solaster stimpsoni and Solaster dawsoni and the abalone Haliotis kamtschatkana, as well as the terebellid worms Thelepus crispus and Neoamphitrite robusta. It seems to recognise its host species by some chemical cue in the water; if separated from its symbiont, it attempts to return to its original host or find its way to a new host of the same species. It is carnivorous, but does not feed on its symbiont, preferring to be transported to new feeding grounds and feed on the heads of polychaete tubeworms, or any suitable prey its host may encounter on its travels. It is an efficient walker but a poor swimmer.

Born in the Pentonville Road area of London, Cantwell spent some time working as a basket-maker before entering the printing trade. Interested in anarchism, he joined the Socialist League in about 1886, and was elected to its council the following year. There, he was a prominent support of the anarcho-communist Joseph Lane.I. Avakumovic and John Saville, \\"Cantwell, Thomas Edward\\", Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.III, pp.29-30 The anarchist wing of the league became increasingly prominent, and from 1890, all the key posts were held by anarcho-communists. In 1892, David Nicholl, editor of its newspaper, Commonweal, was imprisoned, and Cantwell replaced him. He focused on producing revolutionary propaganda for the group. The following year, he was arrested for putting up posters calling for a protest against the wedding of Prince George, Duke of York, and Princess Mary of Teck, which stated that \\"He who would be free himself must strike the blow\\". Although he was held in prison for some time, charges were dismissed. The owner of one of the hoardings where Cantwell had placed a poster then sued him and his colleague, Young, and they were each fined two guineas. In 1894, Cantwell spoke at a rally the day before the opening of Tower Bridge, arguing that the contribution of the workers who had built the bridge was not appropriately recognised. He was arrested, and his colleague C. T. Quinn was also arrested, after he went to the Police Court to ask about Cantwell. Both were charged with sedition; unfortunately for Cantwell, he had in his possession leaflets printed by the Necessity Group entitled \\"Why Vaillant threw the Bomb\\", so he was also charged with possession of manuscripts explaining the use of explosives. Cantwell denied advocating violence, but was found guilty and served six months in prison. On release, Cantwell joined the anarchist Freedom Group, spending some time as an editor of its newspaper, Freedom. He worked as a compositor for anarchist publications, but suffered a stroke in 1902, and thereafter was in poor health, dying in 1906.

The legend states that a samurai, bored on a hot summer day, threw plant material into the small opening of a tall, deep vase on the opposite corner of the room. Thus this style received its name.Averill, M. (1914). Japanese Flower Arrangement [Ike-bana]: Applied to Western Needs: J. Lane Company. This form utilizes fresh and spontaneous designs that adhere only loosely to the classical principles of triangular structure and color harmony. Therefore, nageirebana is less formal than rikka, which was developing around the same time. Nageirebana was also practiced and around the time that chabana and seika were developing. Chabana is considered by some as another form of nageirebana since the principles of the casual style are similar. At some point later the term was shortened to just nageire. Nageire is sometimes associated with moribana, and although the two styles share stylistic similarities, the historic development from each other is different, moribana having evolved later. Many schools call the style nageire, however in the Mishō-ryū (未生流), Ohara-ryū (小原流) and Saga Go-ryū (嵯峨御流) schools it is called heika.https://www.ohararyu.or.jp/english/styles.htmlhttps://helsinkisagaikebana.org/about- arrangement-styles/  Styles  *Nageire upright style is arranged in a narrow-mouthed, tall container without using kenzan or needlepoint holders.

Today the term occurs in German-speaking countries as a synonym for all kinds of footpaths, e.g., Bürgersteig, a term for \\"pavement\\" in Austria or Switzerland. The term steig and its dialectical variations is commonly found in many placenames.  Mountain paths and hiking trails  Steige in hill or mountain areas, often run over exposed, rocky terrain and are therefore more uneven than normal footpaths. They should only be attempted with mountaineering boots or high sports shoes, which extend above the ankles (to reduce the risk of going over on one's ankle). On hiking maps and large-scale topographical maps (typically 1:50,000 scale) in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, steige and klettersteige are usually portrayed by short dashes or dotted lines, while wider tracks are often indicated by longer dashes (cart tracks may also be portrayed by dots and dashes). Popular climbing mountains often have several steige on each side (see e.g. the Rax, Hochkönig or Zugspitze). Regional books, websites, climbing and hiking guides give more detailed information on the routes and elevations, the opening times of mountain huts and the duration of walks. They may also identify and describe potential emergency exit routes. Narrow or steep paths through a gorge or leading to other tourist attractions such as old mines, nature trails, waterfalls etc. are called steige. Those that are especially popular are almost always secured with ropes, steps, ladders or small footbridges.

Ella Whipple (January 20, 1851 - March 23, 1924) was a physician. Early life Ella Whipple Marsh was born in Batavia, Illinois, on January 20, 1851. Her parents were both of English descent, her father being a lineal descendant of William Whipple who was one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence. Her father was born and raised in Chautauqua County, New York, and her mother was born in New Jersey and raised in Orange County, New York. They both moved to Illinois, where they were married. In 1852 they started across the plains by ox team to Oregon, being six months on the way. Her mother was a teacher for many years and wrote for the papers of the day. Dr. Whipple's early childhood was spent on a farm. She was studious, industrious and persevering, and always at the head in school work. Her schooldays were spent in Vancouver, Washington, where her parents went to educate their children. She was graduated in 1870 from Vancouver Seminary. Two years later she received the degree of B.S. from Willamette University, and had also completed the normal course in that institution. Career The nine years following her B.S. were spent in teaching in the schools of Oregon and Washington, where she acquired the reputation of a very successful teacher. She was for two years preceptress of Baker City Academy, and later was principal of the Astoria public schools. Deciding to prepare herself for the medical profession, she gave up teaching and, after a three-year course of study, was graduated with honors from the medical department of the Willamette University in 1883. She received the advantage of special study and hospital practice in the sanitarium in Battle Creek, Michigan. She was an active practitioner in Vancouver, until she moved to Pasadena, California, in 1888. She was identified with the religious, temperance, philanthropic and educational interests of every place where she resided. For ten years before the granting of equal suffrage Dr Whipple was a stanch worker in the Women's Suffrage field and shared largely in the honors and benefits gained by suffrage in Washington. She was twice a delegate to the Clarke county Republican convention in 1884 and 1886, and twice a delegate to the Territorial Republican convention in the same year. In the first convention she was on the committee on resolutions, and in the second convention was chairman of the committee on platform. In the Clark county convention, in 1884, she was nominated for superintendent of public schools and was elected by a large majority, although there were three tickets in the field. She discharged the duties of her office in such a way as to win the respect and confidence of political opponents as well as friends. She had at different times occupied every official position to which a layman is eligible in the Methodist Episcopal Church, of which she was an earnest member, being thrice a delegate to the lay electoral conferences of 1874 and 1878. During her term as superintendent of public schools the Clarke County Normal Institute was organized.

Campbell's research changed the course of vision science.  Life and education  Campbell was born on 30 January 1924 in Glasgow, Scotland. His father, William Campbell (1891–1968), was a pharmacist and doctor; his mother, Anne Fleming (1898–1984) was her future husband's counter assistant before taking care of their four children. Campbell was his parents' second child and their first boy. His parents provided an intellectually nurturing home full of books. Campbell received his primary and secondary education at Glasgow High School for Boys. As a child, Campbell was an avid reader and, encouraged by his teachers and father, had hobbies in chemistry, physics, optics, photography, electricity, and radio. Campbell studied medicine at Glasgow University Medical School, graduating in 1946. After graduating, Campbell prepared to become an ophthalmologist, passing the Diploma of Ophthalmic Medicine and Surgery from the Royal College of Surgeons in 1948. But Campbell became more interested in research than in clinical practice, completing a PhD (on corneal wound healing) from Glasgow University in 1952, then an MD (on the depth of focus of the eye) in 1959. Although Campbell's research work took him to Oxford University and then University of Cambridge, both in England, he remained true to his Scottish heritage and his humble origins. He was much beloved by colleagues and students, renowned for his kindliness, generosity, and stock of good stories. While doing his medical studies at University of Glasgow, Campbell met his wife-to-be, Helen, who became a doctor. They married in 1947 and had four children, one of whom died at 17 in a riding accident. Campbell was afflicted lifelong by ankylosing spondylitis, and by bouts of iritis. He died on 3 May 1993.  Career  While studying for his PhD and MD, Campbell worked as an ophthalmologist from around 1948 to 1951. He then spent a year at Nuffield Laboratory in Oxford working with T.C.D. Whiteside on aviation medicine. In 1953, Campbell was appointed as a lecturer at the Cambridge Physiological Laboratory. He spent the remainder of his career there, eventually winning a personal chair in Neurosensory Physiology before retiring in 1991. He was a Fellow at St. Johns College. According to Neurotree, Campbell supervised one research assistant, four PhD students (David C. Burr, Denis Pelli, John G. Robson, and Roger Carpenter), and seven post-doctoral fellows (including Colin Blakemore, Robert Shapley, and Gordon Legge). These academic children produced 120 academic grandchildren. He collaborated with T. C. D. Whiteside and William Rushton. Community service Between 1960 and 1962, Campbell served on the General Optical Council of the UK National Health Service, representing educational interests for optometry. Campbell was an Advisory Editor of Spatial Vision, and a member of the editorial board of Ophthalmic and Physiological Optics. Research Selected works * Honours In 1959, Campbell became the 14th Foundation lecturer of the British Optical Association. In 1962, he was awarded an honorary Fellowship of The British Optical Association. In 1878, Campbell was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society. He won the Tillyer Medal from the Optical Society of America in 1980, and was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science from University of Glasgow in 1986 and from Aston University in 1987.

That bank was closed on 19 May 1999, by the late Charles Kikonyogo, the governor of the Bank of Uganda at that time. The reasons given for its closure were \\"inadequate capitalization\\" and \\"insolvency to the tune Sh4.8 billion, as at 31 December 1998\\". The EastAfrican reported in June 1999, that the bank's collapse was as a result of the withdrawal of support by USAID, and a case of fraud involving bank officials.

History  The painter Sōami and the art patron and shōgun Ashikaga Yoshimasa were supporters of the style as early as the 15th century. It reached its peak of popularity and artistic development in the 18th century and was formalised in the late Edo period. Works that were published include the Sōka Hyakki (挿花百規), a collection of 100 drawings of shōka works by the 40th headmaster Ikenobō Senjō (池坊専定). Senjō himself selected these works published in 1820. The original drawings were made by Matsumura Keibun and Yokoyama Seiki, painters of the Shijō school.

Shōka shimputai was introduced by the headmaster Sen'ei Ikenobō in 1997 as a new style of shōka. In Mishō-ryū the style is called kakubana (格花).http://misho-ryu.com/about/course/  Characteristics  Seika incorporates many of the structural rules and classical feeling of the ancient rikka of the Ikenobō school. The concept of shusshō (出生 inner beauty) of a plant is key in the arrangement and is expressed as the living forms of plants rooted in the soil and growing upward towards the sun. It uses one to three kinds of floral materials, arranged in a single vase. The set-up is basically triangular, with three main lines: shin the central axis symbolising \\"truth\\"; soe the supporting branch, and tai, which are branches placed near the base to balance everything. Shin symbolises heaven (天), soe symbolises human (人), and tai the earth (地). Together these three elements (天地人 Tenchijin) represent the human universe. The number of branches should always be an uneven number. The length of each branch is also prescribed. In some Ikebana schools in Japan when performing Seika the natural characteristics of the plant have to be respected and the arrangement either done in the upright, slanted or hanging form. Also depending on where the plants would grow determines the position of it in the arrangement. So for example plants from mountain regions have to be placed above those from the lower lands. Plants used should also be seasonal to reflect the respective season in which the arrangement is being made. In other Ikebana schools Seika is a composite that more reflects and emphasizes the design elements using plant materials. This type of Shoka was widespread in Japan in the 19th Century and is less popular today. In ancient times Aspidistra elatior leaves were often the usual tool for beginners to learn the basics of seika as they are easily handled and the side for the sun can be seen clearly. It was not uncommon in the 19th and early 20th century for Ikebana students practicing Seika or Shoka to construct Aspidistra arrangements for a year or more before graduating and being granted a license to arrange other floral materials.

In 1988, Santos et al showed that Angiotensin-(1-7) was a main product of the incubation of Angiotensin I with brain micropunches. In the same year Schiavone et al, reported the first biological effect of this heptapeptide. Angiotensin (1-7) is a vasodilator agent that plays important roles in cardiovascular organs, such as heart, blood vessels, and kidneys having functions frequently opposed to those attributed to the major effector component of the RAS, angiotensin II (Ang II). Synthesis The polypeptide Ang I can be converted into Ang (1-7) by the actions of neprilysin (NEP) and thimet oligopeptidase (TOP) enzymes. Also, Ang II can be hydrolyzed into Ang (1-7) through the actions of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Ang (1-7) binds and activates the G-protein coupled receptor Mas receptor leading to opposite effects of those of Ang II. Angiotensin (1-7) synthesis pathway =Possible synthesis pathways= * Action of the neprilysin on angiotensin I or angiotensin II. * Action of the prolyl endopeptidase on angiotensin I. * Action of the ACE on angiotensin 1-9. * Action of the neprilysin on angiotensin 1-9. * Action of the ACE2 on angiotensin II. Effects of Ang (1-7) Ang (1-7) has been shown to have anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Ang (1-7) plays protective roles in cardiomyocytes of spontaneously hypertensive rat by increasing the expression of endothelial and neuronal nitric oxide synthase enzymes leading to augmented production of nitric oxide. Ultimately, Ang (1-7) evokes anti-arrhythmogenic effects in animal models. In blood vessels, Ang (1-7) induces the release of vasodilators such as prostanoids and nitric oxide. Pharmacological interactions In addition, it has been demonstrated that Ang (1-7) contributes to the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor type 1 antagonists.

Dodson (October 28, 1923, Baltimore, Maryland – May 2, 1993, Long Beach, California) was an American clinical psychologist, lecturer and educator. He wrote several popular books including the best-selling How to Parent. Biography Dodson was born in Baltimore, Maryland, United States in 1923. His father also bore the name Fitzhugh J. Dodson (born c. 1886 in Virginia) and his mother was Lillian M. Dodson, née Northam (born c. 1890 in Maryland). He attended high school in Baltimore, living at 704 Wyndhurst Avenue with his parents, younger sister and maternal grandparents. He went on to graduate cum laude with a bachelor's degree from Johns Hopkins University in 1944, then gained his Bachelor of Divinity degree magna cum laude from Yale University in 1948 and his PhD was conferred by the University of Southern California in 1957. He went on to become a member of over ten scholarly associations. During his student years he was editor of a newspaper, president of the freshman class, senior member of the student council, business manager of the debating council and a member of Beta Theta Pi, Phi Beta Kappa, Pi Delta Epsilon and Omicron Delta Kappa. He had summer pastorates in Tennessee, West Virginia and southern Oregon. He was ordained as a Presbyterian minister in 1948, and on November 6, 1949 he was installed as pastor of the Palatine Hill Presbyterian Church in Portland, Oregon and he also taught religion at the nearby Lewis and Clark College., then from 1957 to 1958 he was director of counseling centers in Portland and Los Angeles. He married Grace Goheen, a preschool director, on August 1, 1958, and in 1959 he joined the staff of El Camino College in Torrance, California, to teach philosophy; then from 1962 taught in the Psychology Department of California State University, Long Beach. He also taught at UCLA Extension. He was senior psychological consultant to Project Head Start in Long Beach Unified School District. He founded the internationally famous La Primera pre-school in Walteria, Torrance, California. Building started in May 1963; the school was designed for children aged three to five and also for the training of pre-school teachers; his wife became director of the school and Dodson himself had the role of consultant. He went on to work as a clinical psychologist in private practice in Redondo Beach for more than 25 years, treating children, adolescents and adults by both individual and group psychotherapy and also educating parents and undertaking marriage counselling. He wrote a number of books, including the best-selling How to parent and How to father, both of which were translated into a number of languages. He married his second wife, Cecelia Kovacs, on January 26, 1974. Dodson died of heart failure at the age of 69 on May 2, 1993 at the Alamitos Belmont Rehabilitation Hospital in Long Beach, California. His survivors included three children from his first marriage, Robin Ellyn, Randall James and Rustin Fitzhugh. Teachings Dodson taught that children need both love and discipline, and this was seen as a contradiction to the permissive approach attributed to Dr. Benjamin Spock. He stated, \\"Many parents also have the impression that modern psychology teaches that you should not spank children. Some psychologists and psychiatrists have actually stated this idea in print. However, as a psychologist, I believe it is impossible to raise children effectively—particularly aggressive, forceful boys—without spanking them.\\" He continued, \\"This does not mean that any kind of spanking is all right for a child. I want to make it clear that there is a \\"right\\" kind of spanking and a \\"wrong\\" kind. By the wrong kind I mean a cruel and sadistic beating. This fills a child with hatred, and a deep desire for revenge. This is the kind that is administered with a strap or stick or some other type of parental \\"weapon.\\" Or it could also mean a humiliating slap in the face. The right kind of spanking needs no special paraphernalia. Just the hand of the parent administered a few times on the kid's bottom. The right kind of spanking is a positive thing. It clears the air, and is vastly preferable to moralistic and guilt-inducing parental lectures.\\" Alongside this teaching, he strongly emphasised the importance of a strong, loving family structure, and favoured three-generation extended families; he taught that society should train people in parenting and grandparenting skills, suggesting that parenting should be taught in high schools, and that evening classes should also be available.

Plot The film begins as an ordinary modern man, resident of Leningrad named Volodya (Gediminas Storpirshtis), quarrels with his wife. Then he goes outside ... and unexpectedly finds himself in 1928 Marseilles, in the body of murderer (according to the inspector who arrested him Jimmy Simpkins) Reginald Gatling. Together they board a steamer which should take them to America, \\"closer to the electric chair\\". But at night the ship crashes and drowns for unknown reasons. Miraculously surviving Volodya, Jimmy, as well as charming passenger Vivian Kingman (Larissa Belogurova) - a carbon copy of Volodya's wife - board the Flying Dutchman which swam to the place of the disaster and continues to drift on the high seas. And then they get to an island formed from the wreckage of half-sunk ships, lost in the Sargasso Sea. The ruler of the island is Fergus Slayton (Arunas Storpirstis), his closest assistant is Sholom-Trepach (Konstantin Raikin). In addition to them, the island is inhabited by: Trepach's wife Maggie (Natalia Lapina), the historian Luders with his wife Frida (Lilian Malkina) and many more sailors, travelers, pirates. According to custom, newcomer Vivian should choose her husband from one of the island's inhabitants. Slayton, who himself became fond of her, locks Volodya and Jimmy in the cooler, but they manage to free themselves and catch the ceremony of choosing the groom. Vivian chooses Volodya to be her husband because she is in love with him. Islanders arrange a magnificent wedding. Then comes the wedding night and Volodya confesses to Vivian that he is already married and has \\"came from another world.\\" But now he does not care, he's in love with Vivian ... Meanwhile, Jimmy is watching Slayton. He notices the \\"tail\\" and is worried. And the next morning, Jimmy accidentally wanders into the hold of some abandoned ship, where he discovers Slyton Edward's brother, locked in a cage. He's clearly not himself. At this time, Slayton approaches. He tells Jimmy about his brother, and also about his relationship with Maggie. This conversation is heard by Trepach. He is shocked by the fact that his wife cheated on him. Meanwhile, Slayton leads Jimmy out, but Volodya appears. He frees Edward, but he ends up running about the island in a frenzy and dies. Meanwhile, Slayton shares with Jimmy his plans for the island: he wants to fly in a balloon, and then go back for the treasure. After that, Slayton pushes Jimmy into the water and shoots him in front of the island's inhabitants. Trepach announces over the loudspeaker everything he heard in the conversation between Jimmy and Slayton, and immediately gets a bullet into his forehead. Then Slayton kills Vivian out of revenge and escapes. He is chased after but manages to fly away in a hot air balloon. But Volodya suddenly finds himself again in his own age. Judging by his ragged appearance, unshaven face and a bump on the back of his head, everything that happened to him was not just a dream. It all ends with Volodya returning to his apartment and sitting down to dinner with his wife, who strongly resembles the deceased Vivian.

In contrast to the existing situation, access to this \\"mixed\\" prayer area was supposed to be from the main entrance to the Western Wall, and in addition it was supposed to be run by a council in which representatives of the non-Orthodox denominations and women of the Wall. The plan was approved by the Israeli government in January 2016, but under pressure from the ultra- Orthodox haredi parties, the government backtracked from the plan in June 2017. Background The Western Wall was administered, by virtue of the \\"1967 Protection of Holy Places Law\\", by the Rabbi of the Western Wall since 1967 (a post that also existed from the beginning of the British Mandate until the rule of Jordan there). Due to its religious nature, the holy site adhered to customs of an Orthodox Judaism, separating men and women in the prayer plaza, women enjoined from commandments that are halakhically identified with men, such as putting on Tefillin, wearing a prayer shawl, and reading the Torah. Women of the Wall is a group of women from various denominations of Judaism that was formed in the 1980s and demanded that freedom of prayer be given to women at the Western Wall, while embarking on a public and legal struggle. As part of the struggle they pray at the women section at the Western Wall every Rosh Chodesh, some wearing prayer shawls or tefillin, sometimes in conflict with other orthodox women worshipers who try to prevent them from praying in the women prayer plaza or from carrying out Torah scrolls. At the end of January 2016, the government approved the Western Wall compromise, according to which the non-Orthodox prayer area (Ezrat Israel) adjacent to the Western Wall, designated for \\"mixed\\" men and women prayer, was supposed to be expanded, and its management was to be handed over to a public council that would include representatives of non-Orthodox organizations and women of the Western Wall. As a result, the ultra-Orthodox Haredi parties threatened in March 2016 to quit the coalition. In response, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu formed a committee to revisit the plan. In June 2017, the plan was frozen under the pressure of the ultra-Orthodox Haredi parties. The plan was a compromise between the liberal Jewish denominations and Orthodox Judaism. The agreement is that the existing orthodox prayer plaza will remain separate, and next to it will be an additional \\"mixed\\" prayer plaza for men and women. Main points  * There will be one entrance divided into three routes of inspection stations: women, men and \\"mixed\\", in a way that will enable each worshiper to choose which path he is taking. In the northern prayer plaza, customs of an Orthodox Judaism will be observed, and the southern prayer plaza will be according to Conservative Judaism and Reform Judaism. Both prayer plazas will have Torah scrolls, siddurim and tables for Torah reading. * Regulations of the \\"1967 Protection of Holy Places Law\\" will be amended and will read: \\"...Local customs of this site (Minhag hamakom) will be based on the principles of religious pluralism and gender equality. Prayer in this site will be egalitarian and unsegregated, women and men together, without a partition.\\" *The egalitarian plaza will have several large and extensive levels. The plaza will spread out over an expanse that will include a raised prayer plaza (constructed) and all of the Herodian Street area. The entire prayer plaza will stand at almost 900 square meters, which is about 70% as large as the present men's section at the Western Wall and 130% larger than the present women's section. * A Public Council, to be appointed by the Prime Minister, will be headed by the Chairperson of the Jewish Agency and six representatives from the Conservative Movement, the Reform Movement and Women of the Wall, alongside six professional representatives from the Prime Minister's office and various Ministries, as well as the Israel Antiquities Authority. *The Prime Minister's office will assign a permanent annual budget of no less than 5,000,000 NIS for the management of the site, as well as the maintenance, marketing and religious services that will be provided to the public at-large.

Ethnonyms The Aromanians in Albania are officially called the Minoriteti Vllah. The local population often refers to them as Vllehë, Çobenjë (from Turkish çoban, \\"shepherd\\"), Arumunë, Llacifacë Xacë or Xinxarë. History The Aromanians were first recognized at the London Conference of 1912–13 as a minority group within Albania. They fought the Ottoman Empire alongside the Serbians and Greeks during the Balkan Wars. =Historical settlements= Moscopole Decorated exonarthex of St. Athanasius' Church in Moscopole The city of Moscopole (Albanian: Voskopojë) was once home to the largest Aromanian population in the world. It was the cultural and commercial center of the Aromanians with a population of over 60,000 people. The city was razed to the ground by Ali Pasha of Ioannina in 1788, causing an exodus of Aromanian people across the Balkans. Many of them ended up in what would become North Macedonia, Albania and Greece. The largest concentration of Aromanians was in the Pelister region of Macedonia, the city of Kruševo and around the Prespa Lakes. The Moscopolitans, or the Moscopoleanji in Aromanian, is one of the largest population of Aromanians today. They speak the Moscopolean dialect of Aromanian and are the descendants of the Moscopoleans in Krusevo (Aromanian: Crushuva, Macedonian: Крушево) are today a fully recognized minority group under the constitutional law of the Republic of Macedonia. Grabova View of Grabova Grabova was a medieval town created in the 10th century. Aromanians have left Grabova on several occasions, although the village has never been completely deserted. The first wave of depopulation took place in the 17th century, when Grabova shared the fate of Moscopole and during the inter-war period, starting with 1931, many of Grabovars emigrated to Elbasan and Lushnjë. In 1933, 15 families from the village emigrated to Romania; they initially settled in the Quadrilater and then, in 1940, in the village of Nisipari, Constanța County, from where they moved to the larger nearby towns (Medgidia, Ovidiu, Constanța ) Another important immigration began in 1950, when communist authorities used the craftsmen from Grabova to build the industrial units in Korçë, Pogradec, Gramsh, Elbasan, and Tirana. The people of Grabova speak the Grabovar dialect of Aromanian. Culture =Music= =Religion= St. Mary's Church in Moscopole Aromanians in Albania are predominantly Orthodox Christians like the rest of Aromanians in the world. In Korçë () they have an Aromanian-language church named 'Alju Sutir' (Transfiguration of Jesus), and is the only church in Albania that is preaching in Aromanian language. Before that, they had another church also in Korçë with the same name, build in 1925 and destroyed by an earthquake in 1931. List of settlements The Aromanian community in Albania is estimated about 200,000 people, including those who no longer speak the language. Tanner estimates that the community constitutes 2% of the population. In Albania, Aromanian communities inhabit Moscopole, their most famous settlement, the Kolonjë District (where they are concentrated), a quarter of Fier (Aromanian Ferãcã), while Aromanian was taught, as recorded by Tom Winnifrith, at primary schools in Andon Poçi near Gjirokastër (Aromanian Ljurocastru), Shkallë (Aromanian Scarã) near Sarandë, and Borovë near Korçë (Aromanian Curceau) (1987). A Romanian research team concluded in the 1960s that Albanian Aromanians migrated to Tirana, Stan Karbunarë, Skrapar, Pojan, Bilisht and Korçë, and that they inhabited Karaja, Lushnjë, Moscopole, Drenovë and Boboshticë (Aromanian Bubushtitsa). Albanian counties, c.1900 =Central Albania= The Myzeqe () is an area in southwestern-central Albania which encompasses parts of the Fier (), Tirana and Durrës counties. It has a large Aromanian population spread across many villages. The Aromanian inhabitants of Myzeqe are referred to as Muzachiars or Muzachirenji in Aromanian. * Tirane * Kavajë * Divjakë * Elbasan * Fier () * Patos * Kosovë, (Elbasan) * Ardenicë * Portëz * Kaçinar * Perlat * Beshisht * Cerkovinë * Çipllak * Grabjan * Gradishtë () * Jubë () * Kalasë * Koshova () * Kryegjatë * Libofshë * Moravë * Përparim * Pobrat * Poshnje * Shtyllas * Skrofotinë * Stan-Karbunarë * Xhyrinë * Zhepë =Southern Albania= In Southern Albania. * Berat * Vlorë * Selenicë () * Ura Vajgurore * Kotë * Gjirokaster () * Andon Poçi () * Humelicë * Palokastër () * Hundëkuq * Labovë * Karjan * Kakoz * Gjat * Erind () * Nokovë () * Mingul * Këllëz * Dhoksat () * Qestorat * Valare () * Vanë * Stegopul () * Suhë * Saraqinisht * Selckë * Sqepur * Polican () * Skore () * Zagoria () * Topovë () * Ndëran * Xarrë () * Shkallë () * Kardhikaq * Bajkaj * Stjar * Përmet * Frasher () * Leshicë * Badëlonjë * Biovizhdë * Çarshovë () * Draçovë * Hoshevë * Kosinë () * Kutal * Vllaho-Psillotarë * Gërmenj * Llëngë () * Grabovë e Sipërme () * Niçë () * Shipskë () * Nikolicë () * Dardhë * Arrëz =Macedonia= A large portion of Aromanians can be found in the small part of Macedonia that lies in Albania. * Voskopojë () * Korçë () * Floq * Vithkuq * Drenovë () * Mborje () * Maliq * Dishnicë * Plasë () * Boboshticë () * Gjanç * Kamenice () Minority status First the Aromanians were recognized at the London Conference 1912-13 as a minority group until the communist era (1967).

The park features approximately 7 miles of hiking and skiing trails, a soccer and ball field, picnic areas, a sledding hill, seven fireplaces, two sheltered pavilions, and a historic 54-foot high observation tower that was built between 1915-1930. The tower was listed on the Vermont State Historic Register on March 15, 1990, and along with its original parcel area, was added to the National Register of Historic Places as part of a Boundary Increase of the Montpelier Historic District (listed as property #562) on February 20, 2018.  History  Montpelier, Vermont in the late 1800s showing the bare hillside behind the Vermont State House which will eventually become Hubbard Park. On August 14, 1781 Montpelier's first settler, Colonel Jacob Davis (1741-1814) from Charlton, Massachusetts, a veteran who had served in the Continental Army, obtained the charter of Montpelier which included the land that is now Hubbard Park. Davis deeded the acreage to his son Thomas, who in 1815, signed the land over to local merchants Capt. Timothy Hubbard and Erastus Hubbard. The land was eventually passed to Erastus' son, John Erastus Hubbard, as part of the entire Hubbard estate. Hubbard Park was established in 1899 with a donation of 134 acres of land, known as \\"Hubbard Hill\\", bequeathed to the City of Montpelier by John Erastus Hubbard (1847–1899) with the intent to \\"preserve wilderness\\" for future generations. Prior to the park being established much of its land had been clear-cut to be used as grazing pastures. In response to the request made in Hubbard's will, the City of Montpelier established a Park Commission to plan for the parks future and oversee its use. In 1907, Dana F. Dow was hired by the Commission to design the layout of the park. Dow honored Hubbard's request by suggesting an informal use of the land specifically mapping out roads that followed the natural surface as much as possible as well as reforestation of the area. Dow further proposed constructing a road leading hikers to the highest point of the park where he stated an observatory should be built. Dedication plaque at the park's eastern entrance drive The road to the summit was initially constructed in 1910. During the 1920s, extensive plantings of red pines were undertaken along the hillside behind the Vermont Statehouse and below the tower site. By the 1960s, the stands of pines grew to obstruct what had previously been a clear view of the statehouse and downtown Montpelier from the tower (and vice versa). Between 1933 and 1936, as part of the New Deal, the Civilian Conservation Corps under the direction of the Vermont Forest Service materially enhanced much of the park. These enhancements were done carefully so as to not cause any disfigurements to the landscape, \\"yet improved enough for greater human enjoyment\\". Designed to make Hubbard Park more usable and beautiful- the upgrades focused on improving infrastructure and planting new trees as well as clearing brush and down material to reduce fire hazards. During this time all of the interior roads were regraded, widened, drained, and graveled. Hubbard Park Drive was improved to allow the park to be readily accessible from either the east or west side of Montpelier. A new bridle trail was constructed which allows visitors to hike the entire park area. 3,000 Norway spruce and 1,000 red pine trees were planted. The park's seven fireplace picnic area and a sledding hill near the parks main entrance were also added. In all twenty acres of woodlands were cleared of brush and down material, seven acres were reforested, and four miles of road was built or improved. During the late 1960s improvements to the park were made such as the addition of a nature trail by a youth group under the direction of County Forester, Norman Hudson. A grant from the Bureau of Outdoor Recreation allowed for the construction of a shelter, barbeque grills, picnic and parking areas, as well as a recreation field that can be used as a softball or soccer field. In 1985, a fitness trail was constructed which included various obstacles and equipment for visitors to use. Additional parcels have since been donated to the park, including 50 acres by William Heney and his family in 1990. Support funding from the Vermont Housing & Conservation Board played a key role in acquiring nine additional acres in 1995. These additions allowed for the expansion of trails to connect Hubbard Park to the Montpelier Recreation Field, North Branch Park as well as the newly built North Branch Nature Center. = The Observation Tower = In April, 1908 Dana F. Dow presented his ideas for the park layout which included the construction of an observatory tower on a summit. The highest point in the immediate area was Capitol Hill which, at that time, was owned by Jesse S. Viles, former owner of the Pavilion Hotel who approved of the idea of an observatory tower in the park. In 1911, Viles deeded this parcel of land along with \\"a strip of land three rods wide\\" to serve as an approach into the park which became Hubbard Park Drive. Dow's original plan for the tower was to provide fine views of the State House dome and the surrounding area. He planned for the tower to be visible from the downtown streets of Montpelier as to entice visitors to make the hike to the summit. Dow emphasized this point: > As a drawing attraction, it would pay to put up something effective here, > and, moreover, it will be a conspicuous object, being visible from a large > part of the city. There may be plenty of other views in Montpelier that are > just as good as the one from this point, but the majority of people enjoy > the novelty of climbing a tower in order to get the view. The road to the summit was constructed in 1911 and construction of the tower began in 1915. An initial donation of $500 from Mrs. M.J. Dunwoodie allowed for the preparation the foundation. The tower was designed by Park Commissioner and avocational architect, Harry Morton Cutler (1867-1930) who was employed as the treasurer for the National Life Insurance Company of Montpelier. Constructed intermittently for several weeks each year by John Miglierini (1869-1930, who immigrated to Montpelier from Italy in 1893) and his employed crew, the tower's stones were gathered from nearby abandoned walls and fences previously used to mark the hillside when it was used as grazing pastures. To this day visitors can still find lengths of old stone fences throughout the park. The tower was completed in 1930 for a total cost of $8,000 (primarily through provisional funding within the City's budget). The inner terrace was added at a later date. Often mistaken as an unfinished structure, the irregular-shaped parapet along the top of the tower was an intentional design feature crafted to resemble that of a medieval ruin. In 1990, the tower underwent general refurbishing to maintain its safety and integrity which included the replacement of the 50 year old iron stairwell. During the summer of 2009, the tower was closed for major restoration, where the masonry was re-pointed on the inside and outside, and the metal stairway was sandblasted and repainted with rust-resistant paint.  Park Features  = Old Shelter Pavilion = Located near the park's main entrance on top of a large grassy hill is the Old Shelter Pavilion which provides a beautiful view of the surrounding hills. Adjacent to the shelter is a soccer or softball field as well as a small parking area. During the winter months the Old Shelter hill is a popular sledding spot. The Old Shelter Pavilion is equipped with barbecue grills, picnic tables, a drinking fountain and a composting toilet. = New Shelter Pavilion = In an attempt to make Hubbard Park more accessible, the New Shelter Pavilion was built to be handicap friendly. The surrounding area includes a grassy lawn great for games, picnic tables, a small parking area, barbecue grills, a water fountain, and a composting toilet. = Seven Fireplaces = Near the center of Hubbard Park are the park's Seven Fireplaces. This barbecue/ picnic area features fireplaces and grills for campfires and outdoor cooking. Leading away from the Seven Fireplaces are trails to the North Branch Nature Center and to Hubbard Park's Fitness Trails.View of Camel's Hump from the top of the Hubbard Park Tower. = Tower = Located at the highest point of the park, the 52-foot tower offers a beautiful view of surrounding mountains. While much of downtown Montpelier became obstructed from view by maturing stands of red pines during the 1960s, several mountain ranges may nevertheless be seen from the top of the tower. The base of the tower features picnic tables and benches as well as a large grassy field. Surrounding the tower are fruit and nut trees planted to attract wildlife to the area. The tower was constructed upon a concrete slab extending beyond its base, which serves as a three foot wide terrace around its perimeter. It is enclosed by a 21\\" high rubble wall with 8\\" epoxy/cement caps. Two 30\\" piers rise on the eastern and western terrace walls that define the formal entry in plane. The tower walls at its base are 5' thick, which narrow down to a 30\\" thickness as the tower extends upward toward the observation deck floor. The sections of the walls are 24\\" thick along the parapet. The height of the wall ranges from about 3' to 4' high above the observation deck, except along the southeastern corner where the parapet stands approximately 8' high. A stone seat was built into this corner of the wall upon the observation deck. = Pond = Hubbard Park also features a small man-made pond near the main entrance. = Trails = Hubbard Park is home to extensive trails that are great for walking, hiking, jogging, and running. These trails double as cross-country ski and snowshoe trails during the winter months. Approximately 7 miles of hiking and skiing trails are scattered throughout the park.  Events and Activities  The annual community-arts based All Species Day Parade spring celebration has traditionally gathered at the soccer field in Hubbard Park at noon on the first Sunday of each May since 1989. At 1:00pm the procession begins from the Winter Street park entrance and continues to the State House.

Loeb (1908–1992) was a 20th-century American politician and U.S. ambassador to Peru, who served as the first national executive secretary of Americans for Democratic Action and Equatorial Guineau. Background James Isaac Loeb, Jr., was born on August 18, 1909, in Highland Park, Illinois. In 1929, he obtained an AB from Dartmouth College. In 1931, he obtained an AM from Northwestern University and in 1936 a doctorate. Career Loeb began his career as a teacher of the French and Spanish languages at the Townsend Harris High School. He provided support from American organizations in the latter years of the Spanish Civil War. He also joined the International Labor Solidarity Committee of the Socialist Party of America and was anti-communist. During this time, he traveled to Europe to help Spanish refugees. He interacted with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, American Civil Liberties Union, and Medical Bureau and North American Committee to Aid Spanish Democracy. In 1941, with Reinhold Niebuhr he co-founded the Union for Democratic Action (UDA), which he served as executive director. In 1947, he helped merge the UDA into Americans for Democratic Action, which he also served as executive secretary until 1953. In 1948, ADA tried to recruit (then) General Dwight D. Eisenhower to run for president as a Democrat, which came about \\"in a very peculiar way.\\" Sidney Hillman had Philip Murray, president of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) speak at a CIO convention in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Eisenhower made a pro-labor speech. Murray loved Eisenhower's speech. He had Jack Kroll of the CIO Political Action Committee (CIO-PAC) ask ADA to serve as indirect conduit and recruit Eisenhower through his younger brother, Milton S. Eisenhower. In 1948, as Loeb later recalled, Eleanor Roosevelt sent the ADA \\"to do battle\\" with the Progressive Party. Loeb went to their convention in late July 1948, where Lee Pressman (\\"probably was the most important Communist in the country\\") prevented him from speaking: > (Loeb:) \\"Could you tell me when I'm going to appear?\\" > (Tugwell:) \\"You better ask the secretary of the committee (Lee Pressman).\\" > (Pressman:) \\"I don't know.\\" So, Loeb left the convention, stonewalled. In the 1948 presidential election, Loeb believed that a combination of Truman's strong civil rights platform plus his de facto center, thanks to walk-outs on the Democratic Party by Strom Thurmond's Dixiecrats and Henry A. Wallace's Progressives gave the American people an easy choice. In 1951, he began consulting to President Harry S. Truman's special counsel, Charles S. Murphy. In 1952, he became executive assistant to Governor W. Averell Harriman.. In 1953, he became part-owner and co-publisher with Roger Tubby of The Adirondac Daily Enterprise of Saranac Lake, New York, which he continued through to 1970. In April 1961, U.S. President John F. Kennedy appointed him U.S. Ambassador to Peru. In July 1962, Kennedy recalled him to show disapproval of a military coup. In 1963, Kennedy appointed him U.S. Ambassador to Guinea in West Africa. In the late 1970s, he was a fundraiser for the NAACP's Legal Defense and Education Fund. Personal and death Loeb married Ellen Katz; they divorced. He married Anna Frank Loeb. He had a son and a daughter. He died age 83 of pneumonia on January 10, 1992, the Alice Peck Day Extended Care Facility in Lebanon, New Hampshire, after suffering from Alzheimer's disease.

Conceived during the middle of the popularity of acid house in the band's native Manchester, band leader Vini Reilly chose to combine acid house, and other electronic dance music styles, with his signature guitar playing on a new album. He created the album in his home studio with engineer Paul Miller. Drummer Bruce Mitchell only plays on one song, with his slot being filled by drum machines on the remaining tracks. As such, critics have described Obey the Time as a Vini Reilly solo album. The album was named after a line from William Shakespeare's Othello, which Reilly felt reflected his musical approach on the album. The album's artwork, designed by regular collaborators 8vo, marked a turning point in the band's sleeve designs with its usage of computer design. A remix of \\"Contra- Indications\\" by British group Together was released as a single in 1991. Upon its release, Obey the Time received mixed reviews, though retrospective reviews have been positive, with critics complimenting its blend of electronic and rock music. A remastered version was released in 1998. Background and recording After The Durutti Column moved further into embracing contemporary technology on their album Vini Reilley (1989), the group's public profile was relatively quiet for the most part of 1990. They played a short tour of London, Glasgow and their native Manchester in the summer as part of their label Factory Records' newly initiated outlet Factory Classical, while the Manchester-based Granada Television debuted The New, a general arts television series featuring a composition by the band for its theme music. It was in between listening to classical music from composers \\"ranging from Benjamin Britten to obscure Czech composers\\" that the Durutti Column leader Vini Reilly began creating the music for Obey the Time, which he conceived to stir the band towards an electronic music direction. Reilly's ideas for Obey the Time largely stemmed from the popularity of acid house music in England in the late 1980s, especially in his native Manchester. Tony Wilson, the owner of Factory, recalled: \\"We were in the middle of the Aceeed explosion; if you lived in Manchester, you were absolutely in the middle of it. Vini, like the rest of us, has lost the ability to age or atrophy, and enjoyed the party.\\" Reilly felt that house music had made keyboards \\"seem so fresh.\\" Wilson reflected that Reilly's reasoning was \\"something to do with a chord being played with three or four notes into the sampler but then different chords being triggered by a simple key stroke, creating mathematical harmonic relationships 'which Schoenberg had searched for but never found'.\\" Vini Reilly assembled and recorded the album alone in his home studio using computers, with engineering from Paul Miller. The production of Obey the Time was very new for the band, as the band's drummer Bruce Mitchell only plays on one of the album's tracks (\\"Art & Freight\\"), with Reilly instead utilising drum machines on the album's other tracks, with \\"Contra-Indications\\" featuring programming and engineering by Andy Robinson at Spirit Studios. Writer Ned Raggett felt this was \\"partially due to where Reilly's head was at this time around,\\" and given that Reilly worked almost alone on the album, Factory Records biographer James Nice described Obey the Time as \\"essentially a solo recording by Vini Reilly.\\" Composition Vini Reilly (pictured in 2007) was inspired by acid house on Obey the Time. For Obey the Time, Reilly aimed to combine acid house music with his trademark guitar approach. While drawing influence from contemporary dance music styles, in particular the aforementioned late 1980s popularity of acid house in his native Manchester, he also drew inspiration from \\"dubby world music\\" and \\"chilled-out electronica\\" styles. Characterised by its usage of drum machine, unobtrusive piano and gently reverberated guitars, the album is defined by how its synthesises contemporary styles that \\"create something distinctly different,\\" according to Ned Raggett of AllMusic. It is more aggressive than previous Reilly albums, with its reliance on constant beats accompanied by \\"sprinkled\\" guitar and piano. Writer Martin C. Strong felt the tracks were styled after New Order and exuded a cold feel. One biography felt the album's delve into house music was representative of the musical experimentation that defines the Durutti Column's material. Many of Reilly's percussion patterns on the album are not specifically acid house rhythms, instead reflecting earlier synth-funk and hard electro sounds, although, according to Raggett, \\"there's enough of the cusp-of-the-'90s about everything to show he wasn't dating himself.\\" The keyboard stabs on some tracks feature the \\"stuttering, choppy melodies\\" of techno music, while, according to Raggett, \\"Reilly's own knack for what suits a song best means sometimes it's more gentle acoustica and other times full-on electric shimmer and drive.\\" The album is also atypical to other Durutti Column albums in that it features very few guitar parts. Tracks such as \\"Hotel of the Lake 1990\\", \\"Fridays\\", \\"Spanish Reggae\\" and \\"Contra-indications\\" are defined by the shimmering \\"nightmarish neon noodles\\" and stuttering staccatos. Obey the Time is bookended by two acoustic tracks atypical of the album's aggressive sound, \\"Vino Della Casa Bianco\\" and \\"Vina Della Casa Rosso\\", described by writer Paul Pledger as \\"opening and closing vignettes,\\" which show a warmer, \\"more personal side\\" to Reilley's oeuvre, as does \\"Home\\". \\"Hotel of the Lake, 1990\\" features funk- styled guitar and bass work, \\"whooshing\\" minimal synthesiser loops and a steady beat, laden with a reoccurring \\"classically Durutti five-note guitar melody with deep echo.\\" \\"Fridays\\" incorporates elements of flamenco music, while its keyboard stabs feature the choppy, stuttering melodies favoured by techno music. Both \\"Fridays\\" and the \\"gently dramatic\\" track \\"The Warmest Rain\\" are sparse and minimal. The subtle \\"Spanish Reggae\\", whose title was described by Ned Raggett as \\"both accurate and not a nightmare\\", incorporates a slow but menacing contemporary dancehall rhythm, with subtle flamenco snippets and Reilley's electric guitar playing processed through heavy dub echo. \\"Contra-indications\\" is a pure house music piece, displaying an explicit influence from the Durutti Column's labelamates the Happy Mondays and New Order. Title and packaging Obey the Name is named after a phrase used by the titular character of William Shakespeare's Othello to his fiancée, Desdemona, in Act One, Scene Two: \\"I have but an hour of love, of worldly matters and direction, To spend with thee: we must obey the time.\\" Reilly heard the line in a TV adaptation and used it because he felt it \\"captured exactly the feel of the work in progress,\\" due to the album's acid house influence being a concession to contemporary music. Wilson later said: \\"In experimenting with certain beats and ideas, Vini was indeed obeying the time.\\" The Mark Holt-headed design agency 8vo designed the album's packaging, as they had for all Durutti Column albums since 1984. They used the Helvetica Black typeface on the packaging and the related \\"Vini Reilly - Genius\\" promotional poster, both of which were designed with Macintosh computers. While Holt admitted that neither the album packaging nor the poster would have looked the same had they not used computers, they were a case of the agency \\"[being in] control of the design and not the software dictating terms. The use of layering develops an already established 8vo approach.\\" He felt that the sleeve and poster were \\"defining works\\" for 8vo, finding them to represent the point in which the agency discovered how they could \\"best use the computer to suit our working methods as a tool to supplement and enhance the possibilities of experimentation and design development.\\" Release and reception Obey the Time was released by Factory Records in December 1990. Unlike previous Durutti Column albums, it failed to chart on the UK Independent Albums Chart. In February 1991, Factory released \\"The Together Mix\\", a remix of \\"Contra- Indications\\" by rave group Together, as a limited edition twelve-inch single, which also contained another remix of \\"Contra-Indictions\\" and an \\"Up-Person Remix\\" of \\"Fridays\\". It received mute acclaim from music critics. In partial promotion of the album, The Durutti Column also played in Paris and London that month, with the latter gig featuring Reilly, Mitchell, Miller and a Chinese lute player performing several songs from Obey the Time among other releases. In a contemporary review for Select, Graham Linehan mockingly described Obey the Time as \\"music for films that will never be made\\" and \\"New Age for those who feel safer having the name of the band on the sleeve rather than the composer.\\" He felt the \\"near-comatose\\" album nonetheless provided several highlights, such as \\"Fridays\\", \\"Vino Della Cassa Bianco\\" and \\"Neon\\", the latter of which he compared to Love Tractor. Factory Records biographer James Nice later reflected the album \\"failed to repeat the artistic success\\" of The Guitar and Other Machines and Vini Reilly. Despite a rating of two stars out of five, Ned Raggett of AllMusic was very positive in a retrospective review, calling it \\"another fine Durutti release,\\" and noting: \\"Where in nearly any other hands this would have been a pathetic crossover disaster waiting to happen, the end results are gratifyingly like what his compatriots in New Order did the previous year with Technique, synthesizing up-to-date styles to create something distinctly different\\". In The Great Rock Discography, writer Martin C. Strong described Obey the Time as \\"[h]ypnotic and holiday-esque (as if basking on a beach in ear-shot of an acid-house disco)\\". He felt that the album's \\"cold, synthetic New Order-styled rpm's\\" lacked \\"any cohesion or formula\\", and rated it 6 out of 10. Colin Larkin rated the album three stars out of five in The Encyclopedia of Popular Music. After some time, Reilly was reported to have forgotten the album, although Robert Jarrell speculated that Reilly, who has a noted dislike for his band's material, was instead choosing to overlook \\"the disappointment\\" of the album. =Remastered version= In October 1998, as part of the \\"Factory Once\\" series of Durutti Column remasters, London Records released a remastered version of Obey the Time. As bonus tracks, it features \\"The Together Mix\\" and the \\"Up- Person Remix\\" of \\"Fridays\\", as well as, in an unusual \\"discography switcheroo\\", \\"Kis of Def,\\" a moody jungle remix of \\"My Last Kiss\\" from Reilly's 1998 album Time Was...Gigantic, named for a line from New Order's \\"The Perfect Kiss\\". Wilson explained in the liner notes that the anachronistic inclusion of \\"Kiss of Def\\" as a bonus track was because he and London Records \\"submit it as a most recent example of Vini 'obeying' the time and as such connecting to the music of [the Obey the Time period] and taking us up to where the ripples of '88 still make interesting patterns on the shore\\". The remix was created by Kier, the producer of the Time Was...Gigantic, and Wilson described it as \\"sorta post-trance, sub-jungle, retro-ambient or something\\".

First published in Boston, Massachusetts in 1784, it was a pioneering work in that it represented denominations from the perspective of their adherents, without imposing Adams' own preferences. The book was divided into sections and passed through several editions, which included minor changes in the name of the work. It was reprinted in England. A View of Religions was Adams' first and principal literary work. It was the result of her dissatisfaction with the prejudice of most writers on the various religious sects. She began thinking on the subject after reading a manuscript from Thomas Broughton's Historical Dictionary of all Religions from the Creation of the World to the Present Times (1742). Development Hannah Adams Until she was twenty years of age, Adams's reading had been limited mostly to works of imagination and feeling. She had never been directed to those of a controversial nature, nor to a study of the disputed points between the various sects. Her curiosity being awakened by a small manuscript from Broughton's Dictionary, giving an account of some of the most common of the religious denominations, she began to read all she could find on the subject. At about the age of 30, becoming disgusted with the intolerance and lack of candor of the authors, she decided to write in a blank book what seemed to her to be the truth. In doing this she had no idea of publication. The work grew upon her hands and became known to her friends. Needing money, she was urged to publish it. But to find a printer to take it without immediate pay was the difficulty. She obtained 395 subscribers, 28 of whom were women, including Rev. Nathaniel Emmons, Franklin, Massachusetts (six copies), Rev. Charles Chauncy, D. D., Boston, Dr. James Manning, president of Rhode Island College, Edmund Quincy, Esq., Hon. Oliver Wendell, Nathaniel Appleton, Esq., and Samuel Adams, all of Boston. The hard study and close reflection were so difficult, that she was attacked before she finished it by a severe fit of illness, and threatened with derangement. 1784 edition An alphabetical compendium of the various sects (1784) A bargain having been made with the printer, the book appeared in 1784. Its motto is, \\"Prove all things, hold fast that which is good.\\" In the Advertisement at the beginning, the author says she intends to \\"avoid giving the least preference of one denomination above another, to give a few arguments of the principal sects from their own authors as far as possible, to endeavor to represent every sect, and be very careful to enter into the spirit of each author.\\" The condition of public opinion is seen when Thomas Prentiss, pastor of the Congregational Church in Medfield, Massachusetts, in the Preface, felt obliged to say:— 1791 edition In 1791, appeared under the title of A View of Religions, the second edition of her book first published seven years before. It was enlarged to 410 pages. Part First treated of nearly 300 different religious denominations which had appeared from the beginning of the Christian era; Part Second, of the worship of the Grand Lama, of Mahometans, Jews, Deists and Sceptics, followed by a short review of the religions of the people of the habitable world. A discriminating judgment was noticeable in the work. This second edition was dedicated to John Adams, then Vice President of the United States, a name, she said, \\"which excites the veneration and gratitude of fellow-citizens, the admiration and esteem of foreign nations.\\" Of the 400 subscribers to this second edition, 82 of whom were clergymen and 16 women, John Adams headed the list with three copies. Samuel Adams, lieutenant-governor of Massachusetts, followed. Among the new names gained were those of John Hancock, of Boston; Joseph Willard, D. D., president of Harvard College; Right Rev. John Caroll, D. D., Roman Catholic Bishop of Baltimore, Maryland; Hon. William Bradford, governor of Rhode Island; Rev. Henry Ware of Hingham; Christopher Gore, Esq., Boston; Harrison Gray Otis, Boston; Rev. Adoniram Judson, Sr., Malden; Hon. Benjamin Greenleaf, Newburyport; and many others. Mr. Moses Brown, of Providence, took fifteen copies, and seven of the subscribers took six each. Such distinguished names spoke well of Adams's literary ability. The book was pronounced the best of the kind ever written, possibly the first. From its profits, Adams was enabled to pay the debts her sister's illness had contracted, and to put a small sum at interest. In its sale, her father, who was called by the townspeople \\"Book Adams,\\" was of much help. On horseback, with his saddle-bag full of the books, often reading a volume, he went from place to place, to sell or to distribute them. Of decided literary tastes himself, he was never happier than when making his frequent visits to the library of Harvard College. Once, upon entering it, he lifted up both hands and exclaimed in great earnestness, \\"I'd rather be librarian of Harvard College than Emperor of all the Russias!\\" Who knows but that if Thomas Adams could have followed out his early desires, he might have been librarian of Harvard College? Circumstances obliged him to go into business, and he made a failure of it. After the publication of the second edition of her book, Adams taught school. 1804 edition A View of Religions (1801) Two years after the publication of Adams's History of New England from the first settlement at Plymouth to the acceptance of the Federal Constitution, A view of religions, in two parts : Part I. Containing an alphabetical compedium of the various religious denominations, which have appeared in the world, from the beginning of the Christian era to the present day. Part II. Containing a brief account of the different schemes of religion now embraced among mankind was published, enlarged, and dedicated as before to John Adams. Through the continued kindness of Rev. James Freeman, a bargain was made with the printer whereby she was to receive five hundred dollars in yearly payments, covering a certain period, for the edition of two thousand copies. In 1804 appeared her book of nearly four hundred pages called \\" Truth and Excellence of the Christian Religion.\\" Her selection of authors and the extracts from their works reveal good judgment and a wide survey of general literature. Not being able to purchase or borrow all the books she needed for this effort, she spent some time in Boston, in order to visit the booksellers' shops. In such places much of the work, as well as the additions to the third edition of her first book, was written. Adams gave this work, with its four hundred subscribers, to the printer for one hundred dollars in books. 1805 edition A View of Religions, in three Parts : Part I. Containing an Alphabetical Compendium of the Denominations among Christians. Part II. Containing a brief Account of Paganism, Mahomedism, Judaism, and Deism. Part III. Containing a View of the Religious of the different Nations of the World. By Hannah Adams. A new Edition, with Corrections and Additions. To which is prefixed, An Essay on Truth, by Andrew Fuller. was published in 1805.

After spending almost five years from 2010 to continue refining the nanomaterials to the nanoFilter. It was very difficult to come up to final water filter with this idea as it was too difficult to protect it in all these years. But Dr. Hilonga used the appropriate Intellectual property Rights (IPRs) strategy to protect this idea up to the end, and in fact the product of this innovation worn the Africa Prize for Engineering Innovation, this is especially the lesson to young scientists in developing countries.  NanoFilter Innovation  As Dr. Askwar Hilonga grew up in the remote area as the party of community, he witnessed sufferings experienced majority of people in the villages in Tanzania and probably this is the common problem to all the poorest countries in the world. Problems like water borne diseases real kill people everyday due to the use of unsafe water. Nevertheless, especially in the northern part of the beautiful country of Tanzania. The water which normal people use seem to contain fluoride while bacteria remain the content of water in most of the villages in the developing countries. The nanoFilter idea resulted from the visit this African Scientist made to his parents' village found in Arusha where people were still drinking dirty water which scares him, that his people were going to continue suffering from water-borne disease.  How the NanoFilter works  It has a slow sand filter with a combination of nanomaterials made from sodium silicate and silver to eliminate toxic heavy metals such as copper, fluoride, or other chemical contaminants depending on a particular geographical area. Water first passes through the sand and then through the nanomaterials. It then absorbs all the contaminants leaving water very clean and safe and can later be removed manually.  Conclusion  NanoFilter is the filter which can filtrate water for about 99.999% and making water free from bacteria, microorganisms, and Viruses hence making the drinking water safe for the domestic usage.

As the Dzerkalo Tyzhnia newspaper wrote, \\"This means that real criminals are detached from controlling the personal data of Ukrainians, and the copyrights to the state symbols of Ukraine will no longer be a source of income for scammers. An important state reform has been carried out, which will benefit not only this power but also the one that will come after it.\\" \\"For many years a myth has been created that the creation of modern foreign passports with a polycarbonate page is an insanely complex technology beyond the mere mortals, but only to select people from EDAPS. Today, the myth of the irreplaceability of EDAPS collapsed. For the first time the full cycle of production of foreign passports is established at the state polygraph combine \\"Ukraine\\". We defended the interests of the state and citizens from blackmail on the part of the manufacturer of foreign passports. What happened before? In the state there was no stock of passport forms. And if \\"EDAPS\\" had any difficulties – the passport was immediately stopped making. It turns out that the private consortium received a lever of pressure on the state, because it was not just a supplier of products, but actually took over the functions of providing a public service – issuing a passport to citizens,\\" said Maksym Stepanov. In 2015, at the ceremony \\"Person of the Year 2015\\", he won in the nomination \\"Manager of the Year\\". Chairman of Odessa Regional State Administration Makysm Stepanov won an open competition for the post of governor of the Odessa region after Mikheil Saakashvili resigned and was dismissed. On December 21, 2016, the Cabinet approved the appointment of Stepanov as the head of the Odessa Regional State Administration. He officially took office on January 12, 2017. On the same day, Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko stated, \\"I am convinced that today, my decision to appoint a person who won the competition, Maksym Stepanov as the head of the regional state administration is the right decision. A person with two higher education is not a new person in the Odessa Oblast, has experience as the first deputy head of the regional state administration, a person who is inclined to work here, but not to travel abroad, a person who is determined to assume clear obligations...\\". President Poroshenko dismissed Stepanov on 6 April 2019 (the decree that dismissed him did not give the reason why). However Stepanov refused to step down claiming that the President had exceeded his authority (according to Ukrainian law Chairman of Regional State Administrations are appointed by the President on the submission of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine for the term of office of the Head of the State). On April 10, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine endorsed the decree on Stepanov's dismissal.Ukraine's govt approves dismissal of Odesa region governor Stepanov, disloyal to Poroshenko, 112 Ukraine (10 April 2019) Stepanov claimed that he was dismissed because he had not refused to paid social benefits to the local residents (the so-called \\"administrative resources\\") to help Poroshenko's changes in the 31 March 2019 Ukrainian presidential election.Odesa governor comments on reasons for dismissal, UNIAN (10 April 2019) Stepanov did not challenge this 10 April resignation since \\"The procedure is upheld.\\"The head of the Odessa region finally released, he does not plan to complain to the court =Strategic Action Plan \\"Smart Region\\"= On March 22, in Odessa, the chairman of the Odessa regional state administration Maksym Stepanov presented the Strategic Action Plan for 2017–2019, which was called \\"Intelligent Region\\" The program is designed for 2017–2019 and provides for the implementation of 4 major regional priorities: \\"Improving the quality of regional development management\\", \\"Ensuring a competitive regional economy\\", \\"Community and human potential development\\", and \\"Ensuring a decent quality of life\\". Within the framework of regional priorities strategic goals, programs and projects of development of the Odessa region, mechanisms of their implementation, as well as expected results are defined. \\"Smart Region\\" is an innovative transformation plan that takes into account the competitive advantages of the region and provides for close interaction with local authorities, the public and business representatives, \\"Stepanov noted during the presentation. Among the strategic objectives of the plan are the modernization of the regional management system, the introduction of electronic services and innovative models of communication with the public, the creation of a national logistics hub in the territory of the Odessa region, increase of cargo and passenger traffic, and also creation of a tourist cluster in the Odessa region. An important role in the plan is also given to the development of the agrarian sector of the Odessa region and the transition from predominantly raw agricultural production to the creation of finished products with high added value, as well as attraction of investments in the regional economy and development of small and medium enterprises. Also in the Strategic Action Plan, special attention is paid to the security of the region, improving the quality of education and health, preserving the region's ecology, increasing energy efficiency and using renewable energy sources, developing self-government and strengthening the role of communities and citizens in solving local problems. To monitor and monitor the implementation of the action plan, and to ensure transparency of government actions, clear performance indicators (KPIs) were developed within each priority. Maksym Stepanov also announced a plan with 12 points in 2017, in particular, the construction of strategically important roads, including The routes of Odesa- Reni, Kodima-Balta, Spasske-Vylkove, the beginning of the reconstruction of the runway of the Odessa airport (completion by the end of 2018), the modernization of the information portal of the Odessa region, the creation of the Odesa oblast brand, the improvement of the investment climate and increased investment attractiveness, Places at least 10%, local budget revenues increase, the launch of medical reform – the creation of up to 10 hospital districts in the Odessa region, the creation of 77 groups of rapid response police, the introduction of the area unified video surveillance systems, launch of free online courses to prepare graduates for testing etc. Minister of health On 30 March 2020 Stepanov was appointed Minister of Healthcare in the Shmyhal Government.https://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2020/03/30/7245728/ In the October 2020 Ukrainian local elections Stepanov is placed first on the Odessa Oblast Council election list of the party Servant of the People. \\"Servants of the people\\" nominated Stepanov first on the list to the Odessa regional council, Ukrayinska Pravda (16 September 2020) References External links * Category:1975 births Category:Living people Category:21st-century Ukrainian politicians Category:People from Skovorodinsky District Category:Kyiv National Economic University alumni Category:Independent politicians in Ukraine Category:Governors of Odessa Oblast Category:Healthcare ministers of Ukraine ","title":"Maksym Stepanov"},{"id":"54980621","text":"Momme Andresen (; 17 October 1857 - 12 January 1951) was a Danish-German industrial research chemist. His main area of work was to formulate better developers and fixers for black-and-white photographs. Biography Andresen attended a Volksschule (a local state school) in Niebüll, Schleswig-Holstein, near his birthplace. He studied chemistry at the Technische Hochschule Dresden under Rudolf Schmitt. After doctoral studies at the University of Jena, he returned to Dresden to work as Schmitt's assistant. His first independent scientific work was to determine the structure of the dyestuff safranin, for the German chemical company Cassella. Around that time, he also discovered \\"Andresen's acid\\". He worked for some years in Buffalo, New York. In 1887, he took employment at Aktien-Gesellschaft für Anilinfabrikation (modern AGFA) in Berlin as a dyestuff chemist. He was already a keen amateur photographer. He had used, and was dissatisfied with, developers based on hydroquinone (which had been introduced in 1880). In 1889, AGFA set up a photographic research unit in Berlin, with Andresen as its head. His goal was to devise photographic developers which could be stored as stable liquid concentrates which could be diluted for use when needed, rather than having to be made up from several ingredients on the spot. He worked on formulations based on p-phenylenediamine and p-aminophenol, among other aromatic amines. He discovered a useful formulation based on p-aminophenol. On 27 January 1891, a German patent application describing and claiming it was filed. That application was granted as German patent DE 60,174. Corresponding patents were granted in other countries, including FR 211,243, GB 1,736/1891 and US 477,486.The Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property was signed on 20 March 1883. Under it, a patent applicant in a signatory state can (for a limited timein modern times, 12 months) claim a right of priority from an application filed in another signatory state. Germany did not sign the Convention until 1903 (see List of parties to international patent treaties). Those foreign applications therefore cannot have been Convention applications. AGFA commercialised the formulation under the trade name Rodinal. Rodinal was still in use more than a century after its invention. In 1892. he turned his attention to dry plate (gelatin process) photography. That process had been invented in 1871, and commercialised in 1879. It had problems; including inconsistent results and halation (German: Lichthof). In 1895, he had a part in devising improvements to the process which led to AGFA commercialising a product in 1898 which both gave better results and was quicker to develop than anything used before. It was especially useful in X-ray photography. In 1940, the University of Jena awarded him an honorary doctorate. He wrote at least one poem in his native North Frisian dialect.\\"Hi schal laawe\\"  Publications * .  * * Das latente Lichtbild, seine Entstehung und Entwicklung.

Her father, Raymond Newton Hyde, was a landscape artist. Hyde was married three times. Her first husband was the writer Clarence Aaron \\"Tod\\" Robbins; they eloped when she was 16 and he was still in college.

The ball's beauty contest had been promoted beforehand, and the event drew socialites, artists, and several hundred young women. It was a costume ball with emphasis on 'oriental' costumes, and Hyde's harem outfit, which was heavily jeweled and embroidered, would later be restored and insured for $80,000. The jury consisted of note artists Charles Dana Gibson, Harrison Fisher, Howard Chandler Christy, Penrhyn Stanlaws, and James Montgomery Flagg, who afterwards painted Hyde's portrait.

Synopsis  The film follows filmmaker Aaron Wolf's personal journey of rediscovery, guided by the narration of Wilshire Boulevard Temple's history and reconstruction. At the time that Wolf was studying at New York University, he had little connection to his faith. He considered himself a “fallen-away Jew” and had drifted from the temple and his Jewish faith like much of the nation's younger generations. Weeks before their wedding, Wolf and his fiancé split, sending him back to his childhood temple to seek counsel from Rabbi Steve Leder. It was then that Rabbi Leder shared his vision to renovate the temple, which at that point was in total disrepair and falling apart. Rabbi Leder asked Wolf to document the temple's restoration, and Wolf agreed to bring on his production company, Howling Wolf Productions, to film the process. Intertwined in the story of the temple's restoration is the temple's history as the first Jewish congregation in Los Angeles, California, told chronologically through the various rabbis that have led the congregations, including Edgar Magnin and Harvey J. Fields. Most consequential for the film and its filmmaker is Alfred Wolf, Aaron's grandfather who had left Eberbach, Germany at the time that the Nazis rose to power and served as rabbi at Wilshire Boulevard Temple from 1949-1985. It is likely Rabbi Wolf's influence on the temple and the community that draws Wolf closer to the subject of the film, the temple and ultimately his faith.

It is owned and operated by the ESB Group. The plant is also known as Ballyshannon. Construction Plans to dam the Erne for power had been considered in the 1920s, but it was not until 1946 that construction of dams started at two locations on the river between Belleek and Ballyshannon. Cathaleen's Fall was the larger and more downriver of the two. Construction of the reinforced concrete gravity dam started in 1946 and was complete in 1955. The dam is long and high. It has three spillway gates, each long. Concrete is used throughout the construction and the generating station is constructed in the modernist style with curved cantilevered stairs and a glass roofed atrium. Generating capacity The plant consists of two Kaplan turbines each rated at on a head of water. The first turbine was commissioned in 1951 and the second in 1952. The turbines, manufactured by KMW, spin at 187.5 r.p.m. and feed the grid at 110kV via their own 10.5kVA ASEA generators. The average output for the station is 206 GWh a year. Environmental impact The construction of the plant had a major impact on the local beauty spot Assaroe Falls. The salmon run at the Falls was described by Richard Twiss in 1775 as \\"a scene of such a singular nature, as is not to be found elsewhere, and is as unique to Ireland as bullfights are to Spain.\\" This was lost when the dam was constructed. It also required the destruction of a late seventeenth-century bridge, a number of nearby country houses including Camlin Castle, Stonewold, Laputa and Cliff House and a number of other dwellings. Nevertheless, there was no significant local or national resistance to the project at the time. The plant has a fish pass to allow salmon runs and a hatchery that produces 500,000 smolts a year, mainly to stock the river. About 4 million elvers are also trapped here to improve eel stocks in the catchment area. Political significance The construction of the plant is important politically as it was the first act of major co-operation between Northern Ireland and Ireland since the latter's independence. Although there was some discussion in the government in the north about the project, joint interest in draining the Erne predates the scheme and subsequent co-operation has been remarkably free from political difficulties. The Weir The site has been used by producers of Conor McPherson's The Weir, with the weir at Cathaleen's Fall representing the fictional location in the play.

Plot A cosmetics manufacturer, J. Webster Hackett, hires Ina Ray Hutton and her band to headline a promotional beauty show. Hutton offers a thousand dollars reward for anyone who can submit a winning theme song. Not knowing of Hutton's offer, a local short order cook, Tiny Lewis, who is also an aspiring songwriter, gets one of his songs to Hutton. Hutton lets him know that she'll give him an answer within a day. When Lewis gets home, he finds out his roommates, Bradley Miller and Michele, have developed a new lipstick. A local beauty shop manager, Janet Wilson, thinks the product is a winner, as well as becoming enamored with Miller. She encourages them to enter the lipstick in a beauty products contest. Through a series and twists and turns, Lewis' song is chosen, and he and his roommates use the $1000 reward from the song contest to pay the fee needed to showcase their lipstick at the beauty products show. A rival manufacturer to Hackett, P.G. Grimble, backs the product and agrees to produce the lipstick at his factories. As the deal is announced, Brad and Janet end up together.

In November 1943 it was announced that the film was being scheduled for production at Columbia. Dreifuss left Monogram Pictures to return to Columbia as part of a deal to write/direct films, where he previously worked in the 1930s. Beauty was to be his first project on his return, with McElbert Moore assisting in the writing duties. The duo had written the story, and in November were beginning work on the screenplay. Shooting on the movie, whose title had been changed to Ever Since Venus, began the week of May 15, the only film to begin that week at Columbia, and making it one of fifty-five pictures being produced in Hollywood at that time. Also in May it was revealed that picture was to be a musical, produced by Rudolph Flothow, and the cast would contain Ann Savage, Ina Ray Hutton (and her band), Hugh Hubert, and Billy Gilbert. The film was in production from mid-May through the second week of June 1944. After production ended, it was revealed that Alan Mowbray, Ross Hunter, Glenda Farrell, Marjorie Gateson, Fritz Feld, and Bill Shawn were also members of the cast. As of the beginning of August, the film's release date had not been decided on, but by the second week of August it was announced as September 14. The film's success led to Dreifuss being given a long-term contract at Columbia. Months after its release, the Legion of Decency gave the film an \\"A-2\\" rating. Reception Harrison's Reports called the story thin and routine, but felt that the comedy overcame it. They particularly highlighted the work of Herbert and Gilbert, as well as enjoying the romantic elements as provided by Hunter and Savage.

The active development of the initial section of the Park Highway began in the 1960s. The modern avenue was created in 1980 as Masherov Avenue in honor of the leader of Soviet Belarus Petr Masherov. It was renamed to Victors Avenue in honor of the 60th anniversary of the end of World War II in 2005.

His name suggests he was from Labroquère, near Saint-Bertrand-de-Comminges. He wrote two cansos that have been preserved in the 14th-century troubadour chansonnier E (BN f.f. 1749): *Mentre que·l talans mi cocha [\\"While the desire is pressing me\\"] ( 21,1) *Quan reverdejon li conderc [\\"When the countryside turns green again\\"] ( 21,2) Along with the works of Guilhem d'Anduza and Guilhem Raimon de Gironella, Amanieu's songs are found only in chansonnier E, which has a high proportion of Gascon, Catalan and Langedocien composers. For reasons unknown, the chansonnier gives Amanieu's name as Ameus. In Quan reverdejon li conderc, Amanieu gives his own name as Amaneus Aureilla, which is perhaps a family name or else indicates that he came from Aureilhan. Towards the end of the song, Amanieu laments that he did not send it by one of his preferred jongleurs, Porta-joia d'Engolmes from the Angoumois and Paire de Bodeles from the . Porta-joia from Angoumois is probably the same person as the jongleur Porta- joia l'escassier (i.e., he who walks on crutches) mentioned by Raimon de Durfort. \\"Porta-joia\\" is a nickname meaning \\"he who carries joy\\". This places Amanieu's poetic activity in the last third of the twelfth century. Mentre que·l talans mi cocha has a refrain at verses 2 and 9 and might be classified as a retroencha. Besides the information gleaned from his poems and the chansonnier, one contemporary document mentions him. In 1188, Amanieu was one of the witnesses of a donation of Count Bernard IV of Armagnac to the cathedral of Auch. His name was spelled \\"Amaneus de Broquera\\".

He also served as CEO of the Transportation Corridor Agencies from 2007 to 2012.  Early life and education  Margro is an engineer by training. He graduated Syracuse University with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering, and obtained a Master's Degree from the University of Pennsylvania in Systems Engineering and completed additional post graduate studies in systems engineering.  Career  = Before BART (1971 – 1990) = After graduating college, Margro worked as a rocket scientist for a year, working as a defense contractor on the Minuteman missile guidance system. In 1972, Margro joined the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in Philadelphia as the only electrical engineer in a team tasked with maintaining an aging and ill- maintained transit system acquired from a private company. He worked at SEPTA for 18 years (till 1990); his roles there included manager of facilities engineering; senior program manager, electrical facilities; chief engineer; and ultimately assistant general manager of engineering and construction. = First stint at BART (1990 – 1995) = Margro worked at BART from 1990 to 1995 as assistant general manager of transit system development. In that position, he was responsible for the BART Extensions Program, including the Pittsburg/Bay Point extension (the North Concord/Martinez station and Pittsburg/Bay Point station) and the Dublin/Pleasanton extensions (the Castro Valley station and Dublin/Pleasanton station). The stations would open between 1995 and 1997. = Break from BART (1995 – 1996) = Margro worked for a year (between 1995 and 1996) at the New Jersey Turnpike Authority as Director of Maintenance and Engineering Services/Chief Engineer. = Second stint at BART (1996 – 2007) = On June 1, 1996, it was announced that BART general manager Richard A. White was leaving BART to become general manager of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, with July 26 being his last day at BART. Potential successor candidates mentioned at the time of his departure were Deputy General Manager Dorothy Dugger (who would become general manager in 2007), Jim Gallagher (assistant general manager of operations), Larry Williams (assistant general manager of operations), and John Haley (former deputy general manager at BART, at the time deputy general manager of the port authority in New York). On September 30, 1996, Margro became the general manager of BART, succeeding White. According to BART board member Tom Radulovich who joined the board at about the same time, there was a general feeling at the time that the BART SFO extension (extending BART to the San Francisco International Airport station and Millbrae Intermodal Terminal) was lagging behind, and part of the expectation from Margro was that he would complete the extension. Under Margro, BART successfully opened the extension in 2003. Margro was also at the helm when Measure AA, a proposal to fund BART's Earthquake Safety Program with $980 million from property taxes, was approved by voters in a referendum, and he oversaw the initial implementation of the program. On April 10, 2007, BART announced that Margro was retiring, with June 29, 2007 being his last day of service. Margro would be BART's longest-serving general manager. Board members Radulovich and Lynette Sweet praised his accomplishments, including getting the SFO extension completed, launching the Earthquake Safety Program, and working out a solution with unions representing BART employees to avert financial crisis. Also, it was during Margro's tenure that BART received the American Public Transportation Association's Outstanding Public Transportation System honor in 2004. The praise was echoed by Dan Richard, a former BART board member. On August 23, 2007, Dorothy Dugger, the former deputy general manager, who had been filling the role of interim general manager, became Margro's successor as general manager. = Transportation Corridor Agencies (2007 – 2012) = Margro served as CEO of Transportation Corridor Agencies (TCA) from 2007 (starting a little after his retirement from BART) to 2012. TCA operates toll roads in Orange County, California. After a nationwide search for a replacement, TCA hired Neil Peterson as the new CEO, with a start date of June 3, 2013.

On 14 February 1804 Charlotte was one of the 28 vessels that made up the China Fleet, sailing back from China. Sixteen of the vessels were East Indiamen of the British East India Company (EIC). Eleven vessels (including Charlotte) were country ships. The EIC also had an armed brig. At the Battle of Pulo Aura the Fleet, under the leadership of Commodore Nathaniel Dance, managed to bluff a French squadron of a 74-gun third rate, two frigates, and two corvettes, into withdrawing after an exchange of long-distance fire. In August 1804 Admiral Linois was cruising in the Indian Ocean in Marengo, together with the frigates and . On the 18th, near Desnoeufs Island they encountered and captured two British merchant men, Charlotte and Upton Castle. They were on their way to Bombay when Linois's squadron captured them. Linois described Charlotte as being copper-sheathed, of 650 tons and 16 guns. She was carrying a cargo of rice. Upton Castle he described as being copper-sheathed, of 627 tons, and 14 guns. She was carrying a cargo of wheat and other products from Bengal. He sent both his prizes into Isle de France (Mauritius).Mercure de France (1804), Vol. 20, p.380.

After 1816, in between voyages to China, Charlotte frequently sailed to Batavia. On occasion she transported troops. In 1820 she carried part of the 65th Regiment of Foot to Mandvi. However, ti took her three days to clear the Gulf of Kutch as she tried to return to Bombay. On 25 February 1825 as Charlotte returned from London she stopped at Cannanore where she picked up troops from the 20th Regiment of Foot. she carried them to Panwell from where they could march to Poona. In between these two tasks, Charlotte twice sailed to the Elbe. The first voyage was in 1823. Within a year she sailed again and arrived there on 12 August 1824. She was too large to arrive at Hamburg. On one voyage she brought back a cargo valued at Rs 225,327. It consisted of iron and steel, canvas, cordage, masts and spars, spelter, and turpentine.

However, he was removed from that position in 1967 and forced to abandon his membership in the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. In 1972 and 1981 Franjo Tuđman was sentenced to prison. First Lady of Croatia In the 1990 parliamentary election, the first multi-party elections in Croatia in over 50 years, the Croatian Democratic Union party led by her husband gained a large majority in the Sabor and he was elected the President of the Presidency of SR Croatia on 30 May 1990, succeeding Ivo Latin. On 25 July 1990 the collective presidency was abolished and the office of President of Croatia was introduced. On 22 December the Croatian Parliament officially adopted a new constitution and the following year a series of further political changes led to the gradual independence of Croatia from SFR Yugoslavia. A referendum was held in May 1991 in which 93,2% of voters expressed their preference for Croatia to secede from the Yugoslav federation. This occurred on 25 June 1991, when the Parliament adopted the \\"Constitutional decision on sovereignty and independence of the Republic of Croatia.\\" On 7 October 1991 her husband escaped an assassination attempt by the Yugoslav Air Force, which also targeted then-President of the Presidency of Yugoslavia Stjepan Mesić and Prime Minister of Yugoslavia Ante Marković. As a result, on 8 October 1991, at a secret meeting in the basement of the INA building in Šubićeva Street, all remaining legal ties with Yugoslavia were severed by Parliament. The Croatian War of Independence lasted from 1991 until 1995 and Ankica founded the Humanitarian Foundation for the Children of Croatia, non- profit NGO and humanitarian organization aimed at aiding the children of participants in the war and children from poorer families. Later years Following the death of her husband in December 1999 she and her family were often publicly criticized, especially by Tuđman's successor in the post of president, Stjepan Mesić. Ankica, a member of the HDZ since its foundation in June 1989, was also expelled from the party's membership under Tuđman's more liberal and pro-West orientated successor as party chairman, Ivo Sanader, who served two terms as Prime Minister of Croatia from 2003 until his resignation in 2009. However, she returned to the party under Tomislav Karamarko in 2012, receiving the membership card number 002. In 2006 she published a book titled My Life with Francek (a diminutive of the name Franjo). Personal life She was married to Franjo Tuđman from 1945 until his death in the post of President of Croatia on 10 December 1999. Together they had three children: Miroslav, Stjepan and Nevenka. Ankica has seven grandchildren: Nina and Ivan are Miroslav's children, Siniša and Dejan are Nevenka's children and Anamarija, Nera and Anton Franjo are Stjepan's children.

Based in Alexandria, Virginia, Portner found success after the war with the Robert Portner Brewing Company. Portner patented two brewing-related systems, one to purify air and the other to cool beer.  Early life  Robert Portner Robert Portner was born in Rahden, Westphalia, Prussia on March 20, 1837 and immigrated to the United States in 1853. Portner spent eight years in New York and tried his hand at many professions, including baker, tobacconist, and saloon-keeper. In 1861, with the outbreak of the Civil War, Portner wanted to see the action up close and personal. He traveled south to Alexandria, Virginia, Virginia (U.S. state) where he bought a grocery store with his friend Frederick Recker and the two men found success selling food and supplies to Union soldiers stationed in the area. Noting the difficulty in importing beer, Portner and Recker paired with Edward Abner and a local brewer to form Portner and Company, where they brewed their own beer to sell to the troops.  Robert Portner, Brewer After the war, Portner and Company dissolved. Recker kept the grocery store and Portner focused on expanding the brewery. Portner learned the brewing process and eventually brewed enough to require storage cellars. He was in debt at the time and asked for extensions on his loans. Union Soldiers had left Alexandria and the demand for beer was not as high as it once was. The brewery continued to grow and Portner was able to pay off his debts. Portner patented a system for chilling lager as well as an ice-making machine that improved the quality of his beer. He eventually had fifty refrigerated train cars used to ship his product. With his successes, Portner further expanded his company to include beer gardens.  Robert Portner Brewing Company  Robert Portner Brewing Company In 1883, Portner had his brewery incorporated and sold shares of stock to his most successful employees. The first Board of Directors included himself as President, Paul Muhlhauser as Vice-President, Charles A. Strangmann as Secretary & Treasurer, and C. G. Herbort & B. Edward J. Eils. Over the next thirty-three years the brewery expanded and grew to cover two full city blocks and all the latest technological advancements. Depots and bottling houses throughout the South helped to expand the brewery's network, reaching as far south as Augusta, Georgia, Georgia (U.S. state). Ultimately the brewery closed when Prohibition took effect in Virginia in 1916. Portner's sons tried to keep the company alive by changing the name to the Virginia Feed & Milling Corporation and converting the brewery into a feed and grain business but did not fare nearly as well, and the company was out of business by 1930.  Annaburg and Family  Postcard View of Annaburg In 1869, Portner was visited by Christian Mathis and Peter Valaer with an invitation to join Peter's brother Jacob as a partner in his brewery and Winter garden in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He visited Valaer's business, and though he was interested he knew he could not extract himself from his brewery in Alexandria. It was here, though, that he met Jacob and Peter's sister, Anna, whom he fell in love with and married in 1872. Robert and Anna Portner would go on to have 13 children: Edwin Portner (1873-1873); Robert Francis \\"Robbie\\" Portner (1874-1900); Edward George \\"Eddie\\" Portner (1875-1917); Alvin Otto Portner (1877-1931); Alma Meta Portner Kohler (1879-1931); Henrietta Marie \\"Etta\\" Portner Meredith (1880-1965); Paul Valer Portner (1883-1919); Oscar Charles Portner (1884-1924); Herman Henry Portner (1886-1916); Anna Florence Portner Flood (1888-1966) (twin), wife of Rep. Henry De La Warr Flood; Clara Louise Portner (1888-1899) (twin); Hildegard Rose \\"Hilda\\" Portner Derby (1889-1944); and Elsa Eugenia Portner Graham Humes (1891-1954). In 1883, Portner bought Mathis' estate in Manassas, Virginia, Virginia. When they had visited in the past, Portner's wife had said that the land, with its view of the Bull Run Mountains, reminded her of her homeland in Switzerland, and that she loved it. As time went on, Portner purchased more and more surrounding farmland, growing his estate to nearly 2,200 acres. Comprising primarily the Weir family's Liberia estate and Wilmer McLean's famed Yorkshire estate, Annaburg would encompass a large portion of the Civil War battlefield, historic mansions, and several earthwork Fortifications including Fort Beauregard. Portner managed to turn miles of battle-scarred earth and scraggly cornfields into lush pastures for his stock and horse farms, successfully establish a dairy farm at Liberia, and considerably expand Mathis' original orchards and vineyards. He partnered with Washington, D.C. winemaker Christian Xander to produce wine from his grapes, which won a gold medal at the Paris Exposition of 1900. Annaburg also featured a 300-acre fenced in deer park where Portner often held deer and quail hunting parties. By 1890, the original Italianate-style house that Mathis had built on the property had become too small for the Portner family, which now included Portner, his wife, and eleven children. He had the house moved and, working with prominent Washington, D.C. architect Gustav Friebus, Portner designed a new home that would combine elements of his favorite European mansions. Built between 1892 and 1894 at a cost of $150,000, Annaburg was a three-story, thirty-five room architectural gem, complete with indoor plumbing, electricity, and porches that wrapped around three sides. It also featured climate control system which combined two of Portner's brewery inventions, making it what is believed to be the first house in the country to have air- conditioning. Annaburg remained in the Portner family until 1947, when his descendants sold the estate to local developer Irving Jackson Breeden.  Later Life & Death  Throughout his life, Portner suffered from weak nerves and rheumatism. As the stress of his multiple businesses mounted, as well as combating the ever-growing anti-saloon sentiment throughout the country, Portner found himself gradually weaker and in ill health. He took multiple trips to Europe to recuperate, none of which helped long term. By 1903 he had all but formally retired from active business activities and was living full- time at Annaburg. It was here, surrounded by his family, that he died on May 29, 1906. Three days later, he was buried in the family plot in the Manassas Cemetery alongside three of his children.

He served with Henry Morgan and was often called \\"Yellahs,\\" \\"Yallahs,\\" or “Captain Yellows.” History Notorious French pirate L'Olonnais put into Jamaica in 1668 to sell one of his prize ships, an 80-ton 12-gun Spanish brigantine. It was purchased by Roc Brasiliano, whom became Captain, with Lecat as his first mate. Together they cruised near Puerto Bello and Cartagena, where they soon captured another Spanish ship. Brasiliano took the new capture while Lecat became Captain of the brigantine. In spring 1669 they partnered with English Captain Joseph Bradley to raid the Spanish. Impatient for plunder, Lecat loaded his ship with logwood while Brasiliano and Bradley blockaded the port of Campeche. A Spanish fleet soon chased the trio away. Brasiliano's ship was wrecked in the escape; Lecat rescued him, putting him aboard Bradley's ship. Lecat then sailed with Jan Reyning, capturing a merchantman, which they kept and renamed Seviliaen after sinking the brigantine. He also sailed briefly alongside English buccaneer Francis Witherborn. Henry Morgan assembled a fleet to sack Panama in 1670 which included Brasiliano, Reyning, Bradley, and Lecat. Bradley was killed assaulting a Spanish fort, and the rest marched overland across Panama into 1671. Lecat and Reyning left the group after disagreeing with Morgan over the division of spoils. They sailed for Jamaica, where they refused a pardon and rendezvoused in the Cayman Islands instead. After raiding Cuba they captured a Spanish guarda costa vessel, which Lecat kept for his own, giving the Seviliaen to Reyning. Sailing back to Campeche, they marooned the English members of their crew and took a commission from the Spanish, who may have paid them a huge sum to switch sides, possibly purchasing one of their old ships as well. They brought the English logwood trade to a standstill off the coast of Honduras, capturing over a dozen ships for the Spanish. Lecat stayed at sea, bringing in prize ships and valuable cargo while Reyning stayed in port, acting as their agent to help dispose of plunder and captured ships. Reyning sailed on his own in the Serviliaen in late 1672 on an escort mission. He waited to rendezvous with Lecat, who never arrived. The following year Serviliaen was lost in a storm near Hispaniola, though Reyning escaped. Lecat was apparently still active enough to warrant the attention of officials in England. He had been legendary in his skill and luck evading capture: English officials tried several times to hire privateers and former raiders to capture Lecat with no success. Reyning himself may have been originally sent to hunt down Lecat, though they joined forces instead. In 1670 Jamaican Governor Modyford sent a buccaneer named Morris (Morrice) to arrest Lecat, who was vulnerable while careening his ship. Morris ignored Lecat and captured a Spaniard instead. Modyford's successor Thomas Lynch sent Captain Wilgres after Lecat, but Wilgres went buccaneering on his own. The warship HMS Assistance under William Beeston hunted Lecat in 1671, only to have him shelter under the guns of a Spanish fort during a brief period of neutrality; Beeston instead captured Witherborn and a French pirate named Du Mangles. The following year Lynch dispatched Morris again, along with Captain Allword. Morris turned to logwood hauling while Allword became a smuggler. In 1672 the English Trade and Plantations committee warned logwood ships to sail in convoy and prepare to defend themselves. Finally in 1674 the King issued a pardon specifically for Lecat and an Irish pirate named Philip Fitzgerald, forbidding them from serving other nations, offering them forgiveness if they surrendered, and authorizing the Jamaican Governor to hunt them down if not: “and in regard Captains Yellows and Fitzgerald, two of his Majesty's subjects, appeared to be the chief instruments of said depredations, That a Proclamation be issued for recalling his Majesty's subjects from the service of any foreign Prince between the tropics in America, with promise of pardon if they render themselves within a convenient time; and that the Governor of Jamaica receive speedy order for securing both said persons if found so offending after the time limited within his Government, and cause them to be sent prisoners to England.” Little is known of Lecat's further activities.

He was an advocate of free enterprise and had corporatist opinions. He was criticized after World War II for working too closely with the German occupiers of France. Life =Early years (1880–1918)= Paul Brenot was born in Ruoms, Ardèche, on 19 September 1880. Brenot joined the École Polytechnique in 1899. He graduated as an engineer, and from 1904 to 1919 collaborated with General Gustave-Auguste Ferrié in creating military radiotelegraphy. . He was an important contributor to development of the Société française radio-électrique (SFR: French Radio Telephone Company) created in 1910 by Joseph Bethenod and Émile Girardeau. In 1910 Brenot was a pioneer in mounting a SFR radio set on a Blériot XI airplane. He was head of the wireless telegraphy (TSF: télégraphie sans fil) service in the Ministry of Colonies from 1911 to 1919. During World War I (1914–18) Captain Paul Brenot headed the second group of the Military Telegraphic Service. Members of the group included Henri Abraham, Maurice de Broglie, Paul Laüt and Lucien Lévy. =Inter-war period (1918–39)= The Compagnie générale de la télégraphie sans fil (CSF) was created in 1919. That year the SFR created a factory in Levallois-Perret in the northwest of Paris. Brenot left the army to become technical director of the SFR. In 1924 Brenot and his first wife bought the Hôtel de Rieux, which had become the Hôtel Amelot de Bisseuil in the 17th century. In 1938 he published a work on the building called Un vieil Hôtel du Marais. As director of the SFR, Brenot was a delegate to the International Wireless Conference in Washington in 1927. Brenot, as vice-president of the Syndicat Professionel des Industries Radioélectriques, became a member of the lobbying group Radio-Agricole Française (RAF), founded in 1927 by the former minister of agriculture Joseph H. Ricard. The RAF promoted the value of radio in allowing rural families to stay in touch with the world. In the inter-war years the ability to pick up foreign radio signals depended on many factors, including weather, time of day, signal frequency and strength and the listener's equipment and location. Brenot noted in La Nature in 1932 that one should distinguish between listening to radio stations and merely hearing them. Brenot was an advocate of privatized radio stations along the American model, where most European nations supported nationalization. Brenot's position was attacked by the radio journalist Paul Campargue, who called it the \\"American radio bluff\\" and pointed out that almost all radio frequencies, transmitter and programs were controlled by a small number of powerful corporations. From 1934 Brenot was president of the Chambre Syndicale des Industries Radioélectriques (CSIR), which brought together 35 of the most important companies in the radio industry. In June 1936 Brenot undertook to form a group of employers that would support social policy as an alternative to the Confédération générale du patronat français (CGPF). This was soon abandoned in favor of reforming the CGPF from within, but there was resistance by the CGPF. On 9 July 1936 Brenot proposed to the Parisian Metallurgy Industry Syndicate and the General Electrical Construction Syndicate to form an inter-syndicate committee of active employers for the purpose of social action propaganda. After a difficult summer the CGPF began internal reforms, and Brenot agree to participate. Colonel Paul Brenot was the driving force in persuading the CGPF to form a social committee. He made sure it did not include Alexandre Lambert- Ribot, secretary of the Comité des forges and representative of the heavy industry oligarchy. After their relationship settled down, Brenot's Comité de prévoyance et d'action sociale (CPAS) worked closely with the CGPF. The CPAS presented itself as an organization of small and medium-sized enterprises, \\"responsible for creating the employers' union and the collaboration of classes\\". The CPAS launched a vigorous campaign against the 40-hour work week, the Confédération générale du travail (CGT) and the communists. Brenot was supported by Claude-Joseph Gignoux and Louis Renault. Louis Germain-Martin, a radical right wing former minister of Finance with corporatist leanings, was elected president of the CPAS on 27 January 1937. =World War II and later (1939–67)= During World War II (1939–45) Brenot had the title of technical director of the SFR, but was the right-hand man of the owner, Émile Girardeau. Under the German occupation there were very friendly relations between the CSF and the German Telefunken company, for which Brenot was later criticized. In his defense, Brenot said that Telefunken's permanent representative in Paris, Doctor Schultz, was a former composer and virtuoso pianist with whom he had formed cordial relations before the war, and who was liberal, anti- militaristic and anti-Nazi. Paul Brenot died in 1967.

In mathematics, a configuration space is a construction closely related to state spaces or phase spaces in physics. In physics, these are used to describe the state of a whole system as a single point in a high- dimensional space. In mathematics, they are used to describe assignments of a collection of points to positions in a topological space. More specifically, configuration spaces in mathematics are particular examples of configuration spaces in physics in the particular case of several non-colliding particles.  Definition  For a topological space X, the nth (ordered) configuration space of X is the set of n-tuples of pairwise distinct points in X: :\\\\operatorname{Conf}_n(X):=\\\\prod^n X \\\\smallsetminus \\\\\\\\{(x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_n)\\\\in X^n \\\\mid x_i= x_j\\\\ \\\\text{ for some }i eq j\\\\\\\\}. This space is generally endowed with the subspace topology from the inclusion of \\\\operatorname{Conf}_n(X) into X^n. It is also sometimes denoted F(X, n), F^n(X), or \\\\mathcal{C}^n(X). There is a natural action of the symmetric group S_n on the points in \\\\operatorname{Conf}_n(X) given by : \\\\begin{align} S_n\\\\times \\\\operatorname{Conf}_n(X)&\\\\longrightarrow \\\\operatorname{Conf}_n(X) \\\\\\\\\\\\ (\\\\sigma,x)&\\\\longmapsto \\\\sigma(x)=(x_{\\\\sigma(1)},x_{\\\\sigma(2)},\\\\ldots,x_{\\\\sigma(n)}). \\\\end{align} This action gives rise to the th unordered configuration space of , : \\\\operatorname{UConf}_n(X):=\\\\operatorname{Conf}_n(X)/S_n, which is the orbit space of that action. The intuition is that this action \\"forgets the names of the points\\". The unordered configuration space is sometimes denoted \\\\mathcal{UC}^n(X), B_n(X), or C_n(X). The collection of unordered configuration spaces over all n is the Ran space, and comes with a natural topology. = Alternative formulations = For a topological space X and a finite set S, the configuration space of with particles labeled by is : \\\\operatorname{Conf}_S(X) := \\\\\\\\{f\\\\mid f\\\\colon S\\\\hookrightarrow X\\\\text{ is injective}\\\\\\\\}. For n\\\\in\\\\N, define \\\\mathbf{n}:=\\\\\\\\{1,2,\\\\ldots,n\\\\\\\\}. Then the th configuration space of X is \\\\operatorname{Conf}_{\\\\mathbf{n}}(X), and is denoted simply \\\\operatorname{Conf}_n(X).  Examples  * The space of ordered configuration of two points in \\\\mathbf{R}^2 is homeomorphic to the product of the Euclidean 3-space with a circle, i.e. \\\\operatorname{Conf}_2(\\\\mathbf{R}^2)\\\\cong \\\\mathbf{R}^3\\\\times S^1. *More generally, the configuration space of two points in \\\\mathbf{R}^n is homotopy equivalent to the sphere S^{n-1}. *The configuration space of n points in \\\\mathbf{R}^2 is the classifying space of the nth braid group (see below).  Connection to braid groups  The -strand braid group on a connected topological space is :B_n(X):=\\\\pi_1(\\\\operatorname{UConf}_n(X)), the fundamental group of the th unordered configuration space of . The -strand pure braid group on is :P_n(X):=\\\\pi_1(\\\\operatorname{Conf}_n(X)). The first studied braid groups were the Artin braid groups B_n\\\\cong\\\\pi_1(\\\\operatorname{UConf}_n(\\\\mathbf{R}^2)). While the above definition is not the one that Emil Artin gave, Adolf Hurwitz implicitly defined the Artin braid groups as fundamental groups of configuration spaces of the complex plane considerably before Artin's definition (in 1891). It follows from this definition and the fact that \\\\operatorname{Conf}_n(\\\\mathbf{R}^2) and \\\\operatorname{UConf}_n(\\\\mathbf{R}^2) are Eilenberg–MacLane spaces of type K(\\\\pi,1), that the unordered configuration space of the plane \\\\operatorname{UConf}_n(\\\\mathbf{R}^2) is a classifying space for the Artin braid group, and \\\\operatorname{Conf}_n(\\\\mathbf{R}^2) is a classifying space for the pure Artin braid group, when both are considered as discrete groups.  Configuration spaces of manifolds  If the original space X is a manifold, its ordered configuration spaces are open subspaces of the powers of X and are thus themselves manifolds. The configuration space of distinct unordered points is also a manifold, while the configuration space of not necessarily distinct unordered points is instead an orbifold. A configuration space is a type of classifying space or (fine) moduli space. In particular, there is a universal bundle \\\\pi\\\\colon E_n\\\\to C_n which is a sub-bundle of the trivial bundle C_n\\\\times X\\\\to C_n, and which has the property that the fiber over each point p\\\\in C_n is the n element subset of X classified by p. = Homotopy invariance = The homotopy type of configuration spaces is not homotopy invariant. For example, the spaces \\\\operatorname{Conf}_n(\\\\mathbb R^m) are not homotopy equivalent for any two distinct values of m: \\\\mathrm{Conf}_n(\\\\mathbb{R}^0) is empty for n \\\\ge 2, \\\\operatorname{Conf}_n(\\\\mathbb R) is not connected for n \\\\ge 2, \\\\operatorname{Conf}_n(\\\\mathbb R^2) is an Eilenberg–MacLane space of type K(\\\\pi,1), and \\\\operatorname{Conf}_n(\\\\mathbb R^m) is simply connected for m \\\\geq 3. It used to be an open question whether there were examples of compact manifolds which were homotopy equivalent but had non-homotopy equivalent configuration spaces: such an example was found only in 2005 by Riccardo Longoni and Paolo Salvatore. Their example are two three-dimensional lens spaces, and the configuration spaces of at least two points in them. That these configuration spaces are not homotopy equivalent was detected by Massey products in their respective universal covers. Homotopy invariance for configuration spaces of simply connected closed manifolds remains open in general, and has been proved to hold over the base field \\\\mathbf{R}. Real homotopy invariance of simply connected compact manifolds with simply connected boundary of dimension at least 4 was also proved.  Configuration spaces of graphs  Some results are particular to configuration spaces of graphs. This problem can be related to robotics and motion planning: one can imagine placing several robots on tracks and trying to navigate them to different positions without collision. The tracks correspond to (the edges of) a graph, the robots correspond to particles, and successful navigation corresponds to a path in the configuration space of that graph. One also defines the configuration space of a mechanical linkage which is constructed as concatenation of rigid rods and hinges. The configuration space of such a linkage is defined as the totality of all its admissible positions in the Euclidean space equipped with a proper metric. For example, for the trivial planar linkage made of n rigid rods connected with revolute joints, the configuration space is the n-torus T^n. For any graph \\\\Gamma, \\\\operatorname{Conf}_n(\\\\Gamma) is an Eilenberg–MacLane space of type K(\\\\pi,1) and strong deformation retracts to a CW complex of dimension b(\\\\Gamma), where b(\\\\Gamma) is the number of vertices of degree at least 3. Moreover, \\\\operatorname{UConf}_n(\\\\Gamma) and \\\\operatorname{Conf}_n(\\\\Gamma) deformation retract to non-positively curved cubical complexes of dimension at most \\\\min(n, b(\\\\Gamma)).

He was the uncle of artist Karl Gatermann, who is typically called \\"Karl Gatermann the Younger\\" to distinguish between the two.  Life  Gatermann was born in Mölln, in 1883. His mother was part of a family of musicians. After completion of elementary school in Mölln, he completed an apprenticeship as a decorator. He traveled between Dessau, Munich and Hesse from 1901 to 1903. Then he studied at the art school on Lübeck under Leo von Lütgendorff from 1904 to 1907. The financial support of the Lübeck physician and local researcher Rudolf Struck (Gatermann illustrated Struck's books The Old Civic Residence in Lübeck, Volumes I and II) enabled him to study in Munich's Academy of Fine Arts. There he studied from 1907 to 1914 and became master-student with Hugo von Habermann. In 1910 he received the First Prize for Painting of the City of Munich for the oil painting Life. From 1919 to 1942 he lived and worked in Lübeck. In 1919 he became a co-founder and temporarily second chairman of the Lübecker Bildender Künstler. In the summer of 1922 he accompanied Rudolf von Laban and his dance group, creating an expressive cycle of movement studies. In Berlin in 1923 and 1925, he exhibited his watercolors in the galleries of Rudolf Wiltschek and in the Kunsthaus Heumann in Hamburg in 1926. Wiltschek conducted a Berlin-London art exchange with a London gallery; Gatermann's watercolors were also shown in England and in the London Times. In 1928, he became acquainted with the painters Otto Niemeyer-Holstein, Ernst Frick, Albert Kohler and the writer Werner von der Schulenburg. In 1942, during the allied bombing of Lübeck, about 100 of his oil paintings and 125 watercolors were destroyed. He died of a stroke in 1959.  Works Gatermann predominantly focused on north German landscapes and cities, though he also painted still life and figurative scenes, and portraits of people including Marie Curie, Wilhelm Furtwangler, Otto Bernheimer, Julius Eugen Kopsch, Hans- Peter Mainzberg, and Otto Anthes.

He began working in the art business from a young age, growing up as the second son of Frederic Stern, an art dealer who specialized in 19th century French painting. Stern's older brother, Louis Stern, is President of Louis Stern Fine Arts in West Hollywood, specializing in Impressionist, Post- Impressionist and Modern Art.

Maurice Bloch. He briefly taught art history at San Diego Mesa College before being hired by Petersen Galleries in Beverly Hills. Stern worked at Petersen Galleries on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills from 1978 to 1991. As newly appointed executive director, he took the gallery into the nascent field of late 19th-early 20th century California paintings, becoming the first art gallery in the U.S. to develop a national clientele for this style. He is credited with coining the term \\"California Impressionism\\" first used in his introductory essay to Plein Air Painters of California: The Southland, published in 1982 by Ruth Lilly Westphal. This was the first book on Southern California painting to gain national distribution. While at Petersen Galleries, Stern mounted retrospective exhibitions for at- the-time relatively unknown or forgotten masters such as Franz A. Bischoff (1980), Sam Hyde Harris (1980), Alson S. Clark (1983), Christian von Schneidau (1986) and Elsie Palmer Payne (1990), wife of Edgar A. Payne. The exhibitions were accompanied by fully illustrated catalogues with essays by pioneers in the field such as Ruth Westphal, Janet Blake, and Evelyn Payne Hatcher, daughter of Edgar and Elsie Payne. In 1981, Stern curated an exhibition entitled Western Masters, displaying works by Frederic Remington, Charles M. Russell, William R. Leigh, and Henry Farny. In the 1980s, Stern served as advisor to the Morton H. Fleisher-F.F.C.A. collection in Scottsdale and was consultant on the founding of the Fleischer Museum which opened in 1990. It was the first museum in the U.S. dedicated to California Impressionist art. Petersen Galleries was owned by publisher and Petersen Automotive Museum founders Robert E. Petersen and Margie Petersen. Stern served as Curator from 1978 to late 1979 and as Executive Director until Robert Petersen sold his company and closed the gallery in 1991.http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520239388 Irvine Museum When Petersen Galleries closed in 1991, Stern opened his own gallery, Jean Stern Fine Paintings, in Encino, California. There, he met Joan Irvine Smith, heiress to the Irvine Ranch fortune. Smith had recently started collecting California Impressionist paintings and a few months later she hired him to establish, develop and direct The Irvine Museum, in Irvine, California, in 1992. The Irvine Museum opened in January, 1993 and was first located on the twelfth floor of a seventeen-story office building. Drawing from Smith's extensive collection of California Impressionist paintings, as well as from a number of specialist collectors, Stern mounted three on-site exhibitions per year. Additionally, he initiated an ongoing series of traveling exhibitions, visiting over seventy venues throughout the U.S., including New York, Chicago, Charleston, Memphis, Tulsa, Scottsdale, Oakland, Sacramento, and many others. Each traveling exhibition was accompanied by a fully illustrated book.http://www.irvinemuseum.org/lastingimpression.html In 2002, the Irvine Museum organized \\"Masters of Light,\\" the first and to date only exhibition of California Impressionism to tour Europe, with venues in Paris, Krakow and Madrid. In December 2016, The Irvine Museum Collection was gifted to University of California, Irvine (UCI). It is now known as The Irvine Museum Collection at the University of California, Irvine. The museum is the initial component of a planned university museum that will specialize in all periods of California art. Involvement and awards Jean Stern has served on the Board of Directors of the California Art Club, the Laguna Plein Air Painters Association and is on the advisory board of the California Heritage Museum.http://lagunaartmuseum.org/pleinair-jeanstern/ In 2017, Jean Stern received the designation of Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded by the French Ministry of Culture. He received the award in recognition of his lifelong work in the visual arts. He has also received Lifetime Achievement Awards from the Laguna Plein Air Painters Association, the Plein Air Painters of America, and from Plein-Air Magazine at the Third Annual Plein Air Convention in 2014. In 2011, he and his wife Linda Weingarten Stern were honored with the Samuel Gendel Community Service Award, presented by the American Jewish Committee of Orange County.

His run was notable in that he was the first Catholic nominee of a major party, he opposed Prohibition, and he enjoyed broad appeal among women, who had won the right of suffrage in 1920. Background Al Smith was the governor of New York from 1919 to 1920 and 1923 to 1928. His running mate, Joseph Taylor Robinson, was a senator from Arkansas and future Senate Majority Leader. After failing to secure the nomination at the 1924 Democratic National Convention, which featured a 103-ballot deadlock between Smith and William McAdoo, Smith ran again for the presidency in 1928. Primary campaign Smith campaigning Soon after the 1924 election, Smith's supporters began laying the groundwork for a 1928 effort. Smith enjoyed continued popularity in the North. Anti-Catholicism and anti- Tammany sentiments were a major obstacle to Smith's nomination. Smith's opposition distributed booklets which capitalized on these topics. Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a Protestant, proved to be a significant advocate for Smith, capable of transcending the issue of religion. Also active within Smith's campaign was Charles Poletti. Smith's candidacy faced the obstacle of opposition from the forces of the Ku Klux Klan. In August 1925, a march was held in Washington, D.C., where thousands of hooded klansmen aimed to display both their power and their opposition to new forces in the Democratic Party. In an implied reference to Smith, imperial wizard Hiram Wesley Evans declared that the Klan was opposed to the granting of \\"political power to any Roman Catholic\\". Roosevelt was informed by a top-ranking Democrat from Utah that its states delegates would be available to Smith, if he ran. The same individual also expressed certainty that Smith would carry the state during the general election if nominated. Some of Smith's supporters within the Tammany Hall organization wanted to confront critics of Smith in regions of the country more hostile to Smith's candidacy and advocated for the development a national organization based upon the Tammany model. However, in late 1926, Roosevelt wrote Smith a letter which strongly warned against this move, believing that it would give opposition greater cause to organize against Smith. In this letter, Roosevelt wrote, By 1928 Smith had become regarded as an immensely formidable candidate for the nomination. Many potential credible opponents, such as McAdoo, decided not to run against Smith, believing that Smith's prospects of securing the nomination made challenging him a fool's errand. As a consequence, Smith was able to secure status as the party's presumptive nominee heading into the convention. At the convention anti-Smith forces made a last-ditch attempt to deny him the nomination by trying to promote the pro- prohibition Catholic Webster's Unabridged Dictionary (Barnes & Nobles)2001 Thomas J. Walsh as a possible candidate in an effort to siphon off Smith delegates that were wary of his anti-prohibition position. This effort failed and Smith handily managed to win the nomination. Roosevelt served as Smith's floor manager and delivered his nominating speech, which received tremendous applause. Some even suggested that Roosevelt might make a better presidential candidate, being a Protestant and a bearer of the Roosevelt name (Theodore Roosevelt was immensely popular). Former Boston mayor Andrew James Peters delivered a seconding speech for Smith. In contrast to the long convention held four years prior, the 1928 convention lasted only three days. The convention was broadcast via radio, allowing Smith to follow it from Albany. At the convention, the party leadership selected Joseph Taylor Robinson as their favored vice-presidential nominee, as he balanced-out the ticket. Robinson won the vice-presidential nomination, thus becoming Smith's running mate. General election campaign Election flyer from Minnesota Reporter Frederick William Wile made the oft-repeated observation that Smith was defeated by \\"the three P's: Prohibition, Prejudice and Prosperity\\".reprinted 1977, John A. Ryan, \\"Religion in the Election of 1928,\\" Current History, December 1928; reprinted in Ryan, Questions of the Day (Ayer Publishing, 1977) p.91 The Republican Party was still benefiting from an economic boom, as well as a failure to reapportion Congress and the electoral college following the 1920 census, which had registered a 15 percent increase in the urban population. Smith's economic conservatism and anti-prohibition stance likely contributed to his inability to coalesce support amongst rural progressives.Changing Party Coalitions: The Mystery of the Red State-blue State Alignment By Jerry F. Hough Smith's opponent, Republican nominee Herbert Hoover, was vastly popular. Additionally, Hoover was running on the record of an immensely popular incumbent Republican president, Calvin Coolidge. Hoover benefited incredibly from the perception of Republican-led economic prosperity, which, less than a year later, would be proven to have been an illusion. =Anti-Catholic prejudice= Historians agree that prosperity, along with widespread anti-Catholic sentiment against Smith, made Hoover's election inevitable.William E. Leuchtenburg, The Perils of Prosperity, 1914–32 (Chicago: University of Chicago, 1958) pp. 225–240. He defeated Smith by a landslide in the 1928 election, carrying five southern states in crossover voting by conservative white Democrats (since disenfranchisement of blacks in the South at the turn of the century, whites dominated voting.) Many Democratic leaders had hoped that nominating the Irish Catholic Smith might help the party to restore its coalition of ethnic support which had eroded by the Wilson presidency, and had continued to erode during the 1920 and 1924 elections. In the latter election, Catholic Robert M. La Follette fielded a strong third-party campaign). The Ku Klux Klan held cross burnings across the country in protest to his nomination and people feared that a Catholic Webster's Unabridged Dictionary (Barnes & Nobles)2001 would be more loyal to the Pope than to the American people. Smith failed to come across a successful strategy to combat arguments that targeted his faith. Some accusations, such as one that Smith would quite literally hand-over the White House to the Pope, were so ludicrous that it would be fruitless for Smith to even begin trying to address them. The issue of religious prejudice was compounded by the fact that many voters also distrusted people from large cities. Thus, many were particularly uncomfortable voting for Smith, who hailed from New York City, the largest of American cities. =New York State= Smith campaigning Smith was counting on a win in his home state of New York, which had the most electoral votes of any state. Under New York election laws, no individual could be on the ballot for both President and Governor in the same election cycle, so Smith did not run for reelection as Governor of New York. Smith convinced Franklin Roosevelt to run for governor in his place. Roosevelt had initially been reluctant to run for governor in 1928. Since at least the early 1920s, Roosevelt had planned to seek the governorship, viewing it as a stepping-stone to the Presidency. However, Roosevelt's plans had long included a gubernatorial campaign in 1932 and a presidential candidacy in 1936. Roosevelt and his close adviser Louis M. Howe were both convinced that this timeline was still wise. They believed this due to their anticipation that 1928 was going to be a poor year for Democrats, due to a prosperous economy under an incumbent Republican White House. Smith was still confident that Roosevelt was the only individual capable of defeating Albert Ottinger, the particularly appealing Republican Party nominee for Governor. Smith estimated that Roosevelt would be capable of drawing 200,000 more votes than any other prospective Democrat. Smith also thought that Roosevelt running for governor would boost voter turnout among Protestant Democrats in Upstate New York, without which Smith might lose his home state (and its crucial 45 electoral votes). In September, Smith formally approached Roosevelt about running for governor. However, he failed to convince Roosevelt to commit to running. Still unwilling to run, Roosevelt attempted to place himself out-of-reach from state leaders seeking to convince him otherwise. As the New York Democratic Party was preparing to convene in Rochester, Roosevelt vacationed in Warm Springs. However, on the eve of the convention, Smith reached Roosevelt by telephone and persuaded him to accept the nomination. Jimmy Walker, then a friend to Roosevelt, placed his name into nomination at the convention. Smith's political operative Robert Moses, who secretly had hoped for Smith to offer him the nomination, was very critical of Smith's choice of Roosevelt. Roosevelt had come to Smith's defense near the close of the election. However, Smith ultimately lost New York by several hundred thousand votes. Outcome Smith during the campaign Smith was an articulate proponent of good government and efficiency, as was Hoover. Smith swept the entire Catholic vote, which had been split in 1920 and 1924 between the parties, and attracted millions of Catholics, generally ethnic whites, to the polls for the first time and especially women, who were first allowed to vote in 1920. Smith lost important Democratic constituencies in the rural North and in southern cities and suburbs. He, however, succeeded in the Deep South in part because of the appeal of his running mate, Senator Joseph Robinson from Arkansas, but he lost five southern states to Hoover. Smith carried the ten most populous cities in the United States, an indication of the rising power of the urban areas and their new demographics. In addition to the issues noted above, Smith was not a very good campaigner. His campaign theme song, \\"The Sidewalks of New York\\", had little appeal for rural folks, and they found his 'city' accent, when heard on the \\"radio,\\" seemed slightly foreign. Smith narrowly lost New York, whose electors were biased to rural upstate and largely Protestant precincts. While the future Democratic presidential candidate Franklin D. Roosevelt managed to win the New York gubernatorial election, Smith nevertheless lost his home state and the presidential election to the Republican candidate Hoover and he became the first Democratic candidate since Reconstruction to lose more than one southern state. Legacy Smith ran again, unsuccessfully, for the Democratic nomination in 1932. In 1928 James A. Farley left Smith's camp to run Franklin D. Roosevelt's successful campaign for Governor, and later Roosevelt's successful campaigns for the Presidency in 1932 where he defeated Al Smith and 1936. However, despite the anti-Catholic prejudice every presidential candidate since 1960 has honored Smith by going to the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner and in 1960 John F. Kennedy the only Catholic president said \\"When this happens then the bitter memory of 1928 will begin to fade, and all that will remain will be the figure of Al Smith, large against the horizon, true, courageous, and honest, who in the words of the cardinal, served his country well, and having served his country well, nobly served his God\\". Smith won a majority of votes in the country's twelve largest cities. In 1924, Republicans had won the majority of votes in those cities by a compounded 1.6 million votes. Smith's campaign brought significant Democratic gains in white ethnic neighborhoods in industrial cities such as Chicago and Boston, where Jews, Italians, Poles, and Irish voted in support of Smith. This helped to bring-about a political realignment which contributed to Franklin Delano Roosevelt's victory in the 1932 election. Political scientist Samuel Lubell wrote, \\"Before the Roosevelt Revolution, there was an Al Smith revolution.\\" University of Maryland historian Robert Chiles argues that the Smith campaign had a substantial impact on the Democratic party's policy platform, and that it contributed to Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal.

It is the second part of a projected but unfinished cycle of works based on Hermann Broch’s novel The Death of Virgil, and uses texts written by the composer based on a quotation from Broch’s novel, in the French translation by Albert Kohn. A performance lasts about forty minutes. History After completing the first draft of Le Temps restitué in December, 1957, Barraqué temporarily set aside his Mort de Virgile project in order to collaborate with Jean Thibaudeau and on two dramatic projects (Invitation au voyage and Echelle visuelle). The projects foundered, and Barraqué used some of the music he had composed for them in … Au delà du hasard. The manuscript score was completed on 22 December 1959, and the composer later added a dedication to André Hodeir, on 12 June 1961. The work was first performed on 26 January 1960 on a concert of the Domaine Musical at the Théâtre de l'Odéon in Paris. The performers were Yvonne Loriod (piano), Ethel Semser, Marie- Thérèse Cahn, and Simone Codinas (vocalists), Hubert Rostaing (clarinet), the Jazz Groupe de Paris (musical director André Hodeir) and the Ensemble du Domaine Musical, all conducted by Pierre Boulez. The score was published in 1967 by Aldo Bruzzichelli in Florence . Analysis The composer described … Au delà du hasard as The work is in thirteen movements, performed without a break: #\\"La Nuit sans rayons\\" (Night Without Rays) #\\"Incapables …\\" #\\"Quelles Marques …\\" (Such Marks …) #\\"La Démesure\\" (The Excess) #\\"Dans la Multitude\\" (In the Throng) #\\"Instrumental 1\\" #\\"Pour la Lisière …\\" (For the Margin …) #\\"Instrumental 2\\" #\\"Avant la Citation\\" (Before the Quotation) #\\"Aveuglé par le Rêve\\" (Blinded by Dream) #\\"Instrumental 3\\" #\\"... au delà des droites Lignes\\" (Beyond Straight Lines) #\\"D’une Pensée sans nuit\\" (On a Thought without Night) The score is prefaced by a quotation from Albert Kohn’s translation of Broch: =French= Mais où tes courants multiples se croisent et vers un but convergent, – un courant étant déterminé par l'autre. – c'est là seulement que tu manifestes la stabilité, l'objet et le nom d'une vérité terrestre, entr'unis, appelés à l'unité, pour qu'ils soient ton miroir. =English translation= But where your multiple streams intersect and converge towards a goal, – one stream being determined by the other. – it is only there that you manifest stability, the object and the name of an earthly truth, united, called unity, in order to be your mirror. This text deviates significantly in structure from Broch's German original, which is a quatrain in alternating hexameters and pentameters. The main text of the composition, written by Barraqué as a commentary on another citation from Broch, is in a style that recalls in places the techniques of French surrealism . The Broch quotation, arriving only in the tenth movement and after a noisy announcement by cymbals and gongs, is sung at first very quietly by the three singers, as if disclosing a secret: \\"Blinded by dream and made by dream to see, I know your death, I know the limit fixed for you, dream's limit, which you deny. Do you know it yourself? Do you want it so?\\" . Seamlessly weaving together excerpts from the Polieri-Thibaudeau scores with new material, Barraqué used his technique of proliferating series to obtain new tone rows from the one originally used for the theatre music: C–F–A–F–B–E–E–G–A–B–D–C. In this case, the method involved comparing the inversion of the row: C–A–G–C–E–D–B– E–B–F–F–A Observing that this is equivalent to permuting the original row in the order 1–3–8–12–6–11–10–7–5–4–2–9, applying the same permutation to the inverted row produced C–G–E–A–D–F–F–B–E–C–G–B, a row that includes three conventional triads: C minor (notes 1–3), D major (notes 4–6), and C minor (notes 9–11). These chords, not chosen deliberately by the composer but engendered \\"automatically\\" by the method, gave Barraqué \\"serial permission to re-encounter elements of the tonal past, as figures in a dream\\" .

Early life and education  Born in Baltimore, Maryland, King grew up in Stone Mountain, Georgia and received her B.S. in English and women's studies from Towson University. She received her M.A. in American studies (poetics concentration) at State University of New York Buffalo, and an M.F.A. from Brooklyn College in creative writing.  Career  Since 2003, King has taught English and creative writing at SUNY Nassau Community College. She has also guest-lectured and conducted workshops at a number of colleges and universities, including Goddard College, Naropa University, RISD (Rhode Island School of Design), San Francisco State University, Slippery Rock University, and Salem College Center for Women Writers. King received the 2015 WNBA Award (Women's National Book Association). She also received The Feminist Press' \\"40 Under 40: The Future of Feminism\\" award in 2010 and the 2012 SUNY Chancellor's Award for Excellence in Scholarship and Creative Activities. In 2016, Adam Fitzgerald named King \\"One of the 30 Poets You Should Be Reading\\", and she was listed as one of \\"13 New York Poets Changing the Lit Scene\\" by Civil Coping Mechanisms in March 2017. She moderates the Women's Poetry Listserv (WOMPO) and the Goodreads Poetry! Group, which includes more than 20,000 members and features the monthly \\"Goodreads Newsletter Poetry Contest\\". She also serves on The Offing Magazine's Advisory Board. King has published five full-length poetry collections, including Antidotes for an Alibi (BlazeVOX Books 2005), I’m the Man Who Loves You (BlazeVOX Books 2007, Slaves to do These Things (BlazeVOX Books 2009), I Want to Make You Safe (Litmus Press 2011) and The Missing Museum (Tarpaulin Sky Press 2016). She is co-editor of the anthology series Bettering American Poetry (Bettering Books) and, with Heidi Lynn Staples, the anthology, Big Energy Poets: Ecopoetry Thinks Climate Change (Blazevox Books 2017). From 2010 – 2014, she co-edited the online response to the BP Gulf Oil Spill, Poets for Living Waters, with Heidi Lynn Staples and co-edited the PEN America Poetry Series with Ana Bozicevic in 2010. For many years, she moderated the POETICS list, sponsored by The Electronic Poetry Center (SUNY-Buffalo/University of Pennsylvania). King founded and curated, from 2006, the Brooklyn-based reading series, The Stain of Poetry, until 2010.  Activism  A founding member (2009) of the literary arts activist organization, Vida: Women in Literary Arts, King currently serves on the Executive Board and is the press officer and Editor-in-Chief of the VIDA Review. Known for its annual report on the rates of publication between male and female authors, in 2014, the VIDA Count expanded to include race, sexual orientation and writers with disabilities. The VIDA Count has been influential in rendering visible a lack of parity in contemporary American literary publishing, thus promoting industry attention and discussion around issues of bias. In March 2015, King publicly critiqued University of Pennsylvania's adjunct lecturer Kenneth Goldsmith’s controversial performance at RISD of his poem, \\"\\"The Body of Michael Brown\\" in her essay, \\"Why Are People So Invested in Kenneth Goldsmith?\\". In August 2015, King curated and contributed to a forum for Poetry Foundation that raised the question, \\"What Is Literary Activism?\\", which resulted in online debate about the merits of literary activism. In 2016, she spoke out about the Swedish Academy’s decision to award Bob Dylan the Noble Prize in Literature.

She was named after the Brazilian state of Piauí. Description and Construction Line drawing of the Pará class In 1904 Brazil adopted an ambitious plan to renovate and modernize its Navy. The Naval Renovation Program was negotiated and enacted in December 1904 and envisioned acquisition of large number of vessels, including a dozen destroyers. In 1906 the program was modified reducing the total number of destroyers to ten. These ships became known as destroyers. The ship had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . She was powered by 2 triple expansion reciprocating steam engines, driving two shafts, which developed a total of and gave a maximum design speed of . During the trials the contract speed was exceeded, and the vessel was clocked at . Steam for the turbines was provided by two double- ended Yarrow boilers. Piauí carried a maximum of of coal that gave her a range of approximately at . The ship mounted two guns in single mounts. In addition, four 47 mm (3pdr) cannons in single mounts were deployed at the time of launching. Upon completion of sea trials, Piauí was officially delivered to the Brazilian government on December 21, 1908, with Captain Pedro de Frontin serving as her commander. She left Yarrow's yard on December 28, and departed for Brazil on December 31. The destroyer reached Falmouth in the morning of January 2, 1909, spent three days there, leaving for Vigo on January 5 and reaching it two days later. Piauí departed Vigo on January 10 for Lisbon where she arrived on the same day. The destroyer left Lisbon on January 23 and reached Las Palmas on January 25. On January 30 she sailed out from Las Palmas for Cabo Verde, arriving in St. Vicente on February 1. After spending four days in port, Piauí left St. Vicente on February 5, and successfully arrived in Recife shortly after 11:00 on February 10, 1909. At about 04:00 on February 14, 1909 the ship departed Recife for Bahia where she arrived after a 21 hour journey.  References   Bibliography  * Gardiner, Robert and Randal Gray, eds.
