Design career Born Adele Smithline, she was the fifth daughter born to Latvian immigrants. At 21 she completed her design curriculum at the Pratt Institute. Simpson took the place of her older sister, Anna, as head designer for Ben Gershel, which was a prominent 7th Avenue ready-to-wear fashion house.SIMPSON, Adele, Fashion Encyclopedia Some years later she began work for Mary Lee, a business also based on 7th Avenue which she bought in 1949 and renamed Adele Simpson Inc. She introduced her medium-priced line of clothing in New York the same year.American Decades 1940 - 1949, Victor Bondi, Gale Research, 1995, p. 171. Like many other American fashion designers who worked within a manufacturing context in New York's Garment District, earlier in her career Simpson adapted French couture and presented it with an American ready-to-wear translation. =Prominence= Pat Nixon's China banquet dress designed by Adele Simpson, worn on February 21, 1972 during the President's historic visit to the People's Republic of China, Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum Simpson received many commendations and awards for her fashion designs, including the 1946 Neiman Marcus Award for Distinguished Service in the Field of Fashion, the 1947 Coty American Fashion Critics Award, and the American Academy of Achievements Award. She was also recognized as the inaugural winner of the Cotton Council's Cotton Fashion Award for innovative use of cotton in cocktail dresses, essentially \\"bringing cotton out of the kitchen.\\"This garment can be found at the Texas Fashion Collection in Denton, TX. As her career developed, Simpson was frequently recognized for this innovative use of fabrics in her designs. Her collections were highly visible in the United States, highlighted in both department stores and in the media. For example, her designs were available at Bonwit Teller, B. Altman, and Saks Fifth Avenue. The March 3, 1947 Life Magazine has pictures of Simpson's crocus suit. The spring attire was constructed of sheer wool crepe. The cuffs of the jacket are made of linen and its buttons are high and snug. It has a petal- white collar.Springlike! Adele Simpson's Crocus Suit!, Life Magazine, March 3, 1947, pg. 60. A September 22, 1947 Life Magazine featured an article entitled Newest styles give every woman's figure a chance. These fall fashions included an Adele Simpson green satin afternoon dress with a dropped shoulder line for $50, and a gold brocade dress with an off-the-shoulder neckline, which retailed for $79.Life Magazine, September 22, 1947, p. 117. Lady Bird Johnson, Pat Nixon, and Barbara Bush also wore Simpson-designed clothing during their time as First Ladies. Simpson designed a wrinkle-resistant yellow street- length coat and matching dress and hat for Lady Bird Johnson for the August 1966 wedding of her daughter, Luci Johnson. Pat Nixon's 1973 inaugural gown - a turquoise blue silk organza and silver silk lame princess-line dress - was also designed by Simpson. = Design Inspiration = Simpson often travelled internationally and drew inspiration from the fashions and material culture of other cultures. She collected fabrics, trimmings, accessories, and toys, all of which inspired her designs. For example, sari fabrics were incorporated in a collection she showed in the New York World's Fair, and Simpson's 1970 fall collection featured Japanese-styled, high-necked, hobble-skirted dresses in Japanese silk prints.Adele Simpson, Current Biography Yearbook, H.W. Wilson Company, 1971, p. 398 Her work and collections were celebrated in the Fashion Institute of Technology Museum's 1978 exhibition \\"1001 Treasures of Design,\\" which included objects and clothing from around the world paired with Simpson's own designs. That same year she donated her collection of artifacts, magazines, and costumes to FIT, though she continued designing following that. =Later years= Simpson continued to design into her 70s before she retired in 1985. Her daughter, Joan Raines, and her son-in-law, Richard Raines, maintained the business prior to selling out to Barron Peters in 1991. Based in Lowell, Massachusetts, the firm chose not to continue the Adele Simpson line. Barron Peters later filed for bankruptcy. Death Simpson died at her Greenwich, Connecticut home in 1995. Her husband, Wesley Simpson, a textile executive, died in 1976. Aside from her daughter, Simpson was survived by a son, Jeffrey, also of Manhattan. She had three grandchildren.

The senior pastor is Dudley Rutherford. In 2008, Outreach Magazine ranked Shepherd of the Hills 92nd in size in America, with attendance of 7,400. Some criticize churches like this, calling them \\"church lite\\", but others say they help people who find the experience more accessible than traditional churches. The church was formed in 1995 when Hillcrest Christian Church in Granada Hills was united with First Baptist Church of Van Nuys to become the present Shepherd of the Hills Church in Porter Ranch. Since then the church has expanded to more than 10,000 members worshiping at 21 different venues each weekend. There are four daughter churches and seven satellite campuses. In October 2006 the church opened its first hybrid, Westside Shepherd of the Hills Church, based at the Wadsworth Theatre on the grounds of the Veterans Administration in Brentwood, California. Rutherford travelled to the new location almost every Sunday to deliver the message. The church now has campuses in Porter Ranch and Woodland Hills. In August 2009 Rutherford said attendance had grown from an average of 8,030 in the previous year to 9,673 in 2009, a 17% increase. He attributed the increase to a feeling of despair brought about by the economic downturn, and a need to focus on spiritual needs rather than pursuit of the dollar. The church also has divisions for kids, youth, and young adults. Shepherd Kids gives kids from pre-kindergarten to sixth grade the opportunity to make friends and learn about Jesus through activities. Shepherd Youth is for everyone from sixth grade through high school. There are Saturday and Sunday youth services, small group discussions every Wednesday during the school year, and fun events. Shepherd Young Adults is for those age 18-25. They meet every Thursday evening for worship, a sermon, and a dinner where you can socialize with others. In addition, there are programs for seniors, veterans, those who have lost loved ones, small group discussions for adults, and much more.

Background and early career It is not known when Cui Anqian was born. He was from the prominent Cui clan of Qinghe (Ê∏ÖÊ≤≥, in modern Xingtai, Hebei), which claimed ancestry from the ruling house of the Spring and Autumn period state Qi, and which traced its ancestry to officials of Qin Dynasty, Han Dynasty, Cao Wei, Jin Dynasty (265-420), Later Zhao, Southern Yan, Liu Song, Northern Wei, Northern Qi, and Tang Dynasty. Cui Anqian's grandfather Cui Yi () served as a prefectural prefect, and his father Cui Cong () served as a regional governor and was created the Count of Qinghe. He had at least three older brothers, Cui Yanfang (), Cui Shenyou (who would later serve as chancellor), and Cui Zhoushu (), and at least one younger brother, Cui Yanchong ().New Book of Tang, vol. 72. Cui Anqian passed the imperial examinations in the Jinshi class in 849, during the reign of Emperor XuƒÅnzong.Old Book of Tang, vol. 177. During the reign of Emperor XuƒÅnzong's son Emperor Yizong, he would successively serve as the governor (ËßÄÂØü‰Ωø, Guanchashi) of Jiangxi Circuit (Ê±üË•ø, headquartered in modern Nanchang, Jiangxi) and then the military governor (Jiedushi) of Zhongwu Circuit (Âø†Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Xuchang, Henan)New Book of Tang, vol. 114. as well as the prefect of Zhongwu's capital Xu Prefecture (). During Emperor Xizong's reign During the reign of Emperor Yizong's son Emperor Xizong, the Tang realm became overrun by agrarian rebels. In 876, Cui Anqian, pursuant to Emperor Xizong's orders, sent troops under his officer Zhang Zimian () to combat the major agrarian rebel Wang Xianzhi.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 252. In 877, however, Emperor Xizong ordered Zhang Zimian to transfer his 7,000 men to another Zhongwu officer, Zhang Guan (), who was to serve under the overall commander of the operations against Wang, Song Wei ()‚Äîwho, for reasons lost to history, had long despised Zhang Zimian. The chancellor Zheng Tian objected, pointing out that giving the Zhongwu troops to Song would leave Cui and Zhongwu Circuit defenseless;Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 253. as a result, Emperor Xizong had Zhang Zimian give 4,000 of his soldiers to Song, while allowing him to return to Zhongwu with 3,000 men. Cui was subsequently transferred to Xichuan Circuit (Ë•øÂ∑ù, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan) to serve as its military governor and the mayor of its capital Chengdu Municipality. Once there, he tried to root out corruption that was rampant under the prior military governor Gao Pian and to revise improper regulations that Gao had imposed. He also tried to strengthen Xichuan's defenses by improving military training. In 878, when Dali, which had long been in intermittent warfare with Tang, made peace overtures through letters that its prime minister wrote to the Tang Office of the Chancellors, the chancellors did not respond directly but had Cui author a response in his own name. Eventually, however, Cui's actions to try to rectify the problems that Gao left him offended Gao's ally, the chancellor Lu Xi, and Lu falsely accused Cui of crimes. Cui was thus removed from his office, given the honorary post of advisor to the Crown Prince (even though there was no crown prince at the time), and sent to the eastern capital Luoyang. After the major agrarian rebel Huang Chao captured the capital Chang'an around the new year 881 and established his own state of Qi as its emperor, Emperor Xizong fled to Chengdu.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 254. Cui followed Emperor Xizong there, and was subsequently made senior advisor to the Crown Prince. In 882, with Gao, then titular overall commander of the operations against Huang, taking no real actions against Huang, the chancellor Wang Duo volunteered to oversee the operations against Huang. Emperor Xizong agreed, and further made Cui Wang's deputy. (Gao, in anger, wrote an irreverent submission to Emperor Xizong that accused Wang of being a failed general and Cui of being corrupt, and Emperor Xizong had Zheng author a harshly worded response.) In 883, however, after Wang was relieved of his command, Cui was also relieved of his command and made the defender of Luoyang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 255. In 886, when the warlord Zhu Mei supported Emperor Xizong's distant cousin Li Yun the Prince of Xiang as a competing claimant to the imperial throne, Cui, who was then at Hezhong Circuit (Ê≤≥‰∏≠, headquartered in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi), submitted a letter supporting Li Yun's claim, along with other imperial officials then at Hezhong. He appeared to suffer no reprisals after both Li Yun and Zhu were killed later in the year, however.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 256. During Emperor Zhaozong's reign In 889, by which time Emperor Xizong's brother Emperor Zhaozong was emperor, Wang Jingwu the military governor of Pinglu Circuit (Âπ≥Áõß, headquartered in modern Weifang, Shandong) died. Most of Wang's officers supported his son Wang Shifan as his successor, but one of his officers, Zhang Chan () the prefect of Di Prefecture (Ê££Â∑û, in modern Binzhou, Shandong), refused to support Wang Shifan. Emperor Zhaozong, trying to take initiative in this conflict, commissioned Cui Anqian as the military governor of Pinglu, carrying the honorary chancellor title of Shizhong (). Zhang welcomed Cui to Di Prefecture and planned a campaign against Wang Shifan. The campaign apparently lasted for more than a year, but in early 891, Wang Shifan, after killing the officer Lu Hong (), who had turned against him, used the momentum to attack Di Prefecture. Di fell, and Wang killed Zhang; Cui fled back to Chang'an. Emperor Zhaozong subsequently commissioned Wang as the military governor of Pinglu.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 258. Cui subsequently died, although the date is not known. He was given the posthumous name of Zhenxiao (Ë≤ûÂ≠ù, \\"faithful and filially pious\\").

According to the Buckminster Fuller Challenge website: \\"Winning solutions are regionally specific yet globally applicable and present a truly comprehensive, anticipatory, integrated approach to solving the world's complex problems.\\" Furthermore, the criteria of the Challenge calls not for a stand-alone solution, but an integrated strategy that addresses social, environmental, economic and cultural issues. This is aligned with the design approach of Buckminster Fuller, which he referred to as \\"comprehensive anticipatory design science\\". Winners of the Buckminster Fuller Challenge include John Todd (2008), MIT's Smart Cities Group (2009), , Allan Savory and the Africa Center for Holistic management (2010), Blue Ventures (2011), the Living Building Challenge (2012), and GreenWave (2015). Each year's winner is ultimately decided by an international jury of renowned whole systems thinkers and practitioners of sustainability.

Stone's book is loosely based on true events through her occupation in one of Manhattan's high-rise luxury hotels. Through her firsthand experience of the seedy, underhanded and often illegal activities, she exposed the realities of the hospitality industry, albeit with a humorous twist. Many in the industry have self-identified with the characters in her book, and have lashed out at her in their paranoia. Educated first in France (L'Universite de Poitiers en La Rochelle and La Sorbonne, Paris), she went on to earn a BA from SUNY at Stony Brook and an MBA in international marketing at Pace University. Stone was a commercial banker who operated a credit/credit risk consulting company for over ten years with some of the top financial institutions as her clients. During this time, she took a year off to work in the hospitality industry, the subject matter of her first book. Stone is also fluent in French. She contributes her sense of humour in part to her third cousin Sam Levenson who was a popular American humorist, writer, television host and journalist. She spent much of her childhood and adult summers with him at her family's home in the Catskills, maintaining a close relationship with him until his death in 1980. On 2/4/2010 Maura was one of the featured news stories and was interviewed by Brad Driver and Lisa G of the Howard Stern Show due to the many references in her book to Mr. Stern.

It aired from September 13, 2010, until April 25, 2012. Syndicated by CBS Television Distribution, the program featured the traditional court show format of small claims court cases argued in the forum of binding arbitration. In the first season when Nancy Grace was the adjudicator, the usual \\"panel/seal/bench\\" setting of a traditional court show was not used, as the show used a more modern setting, including an open lectern where Grace stood rather than sat, a large projection display in the studio, and a set mainly fitted with brightly colored backgrounds, with no bar separating the audience gallery (who sat in the round along the edges of the set) from the litigants. In the first season, the program was shot at the studios of Georgia Public Broadcasting in Atlanta to accommodate Grace wanting to stay in the Atlanta area, and CBS received subsidies from the Georgia Film, Music & Digital Entertainment Office to do so; both GPB and the Georgia Film Office received end credits for their assistance in the program. In May 2011 however, the program began to film instead at Sunset Bronson Studios in Hollywood, California, forcing Grace to commute to Los Angeles for cases. On May 24, 2011, it was announced that Jackie Glass, known for presiding over the O. J. Simpson robbery case in Las Vegas, would replace Grace on Swift Justice, and the show would move production to Los Angeles. Grace told the New York Post that family obligations were the deciding factor in her departure. In the course of the move, the program came under the production authority of Big Ticket Television, which produces Judge Judy and Judge Joe Brown, and was reduced from being transmitted in high definition to being filmed in 480i standard definition and became a more traditional court show, likely as filming took place in the same studio as the latter programs with a different set; those shows had not yet switched to HD for that season. Another element of the program, which used Polycom and Skype video from litigant's homes to adjudicate some cases via webcam to reduce travel costs, was also dropped for the second season. Swift Justice was canceled due to low ratings near the end of the second season. The final original episode aired on April 25, 2012, with repeats continuing until September 2012.

It is the country's oldest bar association, and with over 24,000 members, continues to be one of its largest and most influential. Origins In the years following the end of the Civil War, the reputation of New York's legal profession was in decline. The New York state constitutional convention of 1846 had eliminated all property qualifications and significantly lowered educational requirements for admission to the bar, and had changed the state's system of choosing judges from an appointive to an elective one. By the 1860s in many districts restrictions on practicing law were minimal, and judges were too fearful of a popular electoral backlash to raise them significantly, resulting in a glut of under-qualified lawyers in the city's courts.George Martin, Causes and Conflicts: The Centennial History of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York. New York, NY: Fordham University Press, 1997, p. 32 The Tweed and Erie Rings play blind man's bluff with justice, by Thomas Nast. In addition, the profession was marred by a series of high-profile scandals and allegations of corruption linking prominent New York lawyers to the politicians of Tammany Hall and the questionable business practices of powerful industrialists. The Erie War, a two-year legal struggle over control of the Erie Railroad between shipping magnate Cornelius Vanderbilt and Erie board members Daniel Drew, Jay Gould, and Jim Fisk, was one of the most notorious incidents. The court battle implicated some of New York's leading lawyers and judges in widely criticized instances of corruption, vote buying, and obstructionist legal tactics. Respected lawyers retained by both parties‚Äîincluding Charles O'Conor and the noted legal reformer David Dudley Field‚Äîmanipulated a confusing code of civil procedure to delay litigation and worked to appoint friends and political allies as receivers of valuable railroad stock, while other lawyers openly lobbied to bribe the New York State Legislature on their clients' behalf.Martin, Causes, p. 6, 31 New York judge George C. Barnard, before whom many of the arguments were heard, and who was a known associate of the infamous William \\"Boss\\" Tweed, was later impeached on corruption charges in part for rulings made during the case. The spectacle was the catalyst for widespread calls to regulate the legal profession. Charles Francis Adams, Jr., lawyer and grandson of John Quincy Adams, criticized the affair in the American Law Review as an \\"extraordinary perversion of the process of law,\\" Martin, p. 9 and The New York Times called for a legal professional organization similar to those that already existed in London and Liverpool. \\"Such an organization is sadly needed in this City,\\" the Times editorialized on June 20, 1869, \\"and if the respectable members consult their professional interests and expectations they will form one at an early date.\\" Martin, p. 12 In December 1869, prominent lawyers began circulating a \\"call for organization\\" of the legal profession in order to \\"sustain the profession in its proper position in the community, and‚Ä¶enable it to serve the public.\\" Martin, p. 15 Early years The \\"call to organization\\" became the basis for the formation of the New York City Bar Association. The two hundred initial signatories of the document ‚Äî all prominent New York attorneys ‚Äî met to draft the Association's constitution and bylaws on February 15, 1870 in a school house on the corner of Fifth Avenue and 28th Street. Portrait of William Maxwell Evarts, the first president of the New York City Bar AssociationA year later, when the Association was legally incorporated, it had enrolled 493 members, representing nearly one in eight attorneys in New York City. Aside from the establishment of a law library, still considered the most comprehensive in the country, the Bar Association's purpose, as stated in its constitution, was legal reform: \\"cultivating the science of jurisprudence, promoting reforms in the law, facilitating and improving the administration of justice, elevating the standard of integrity, honor and courtesy in the legal profession, and cherishing the spirit of collegiality among the members thereof.\\" New York City Bar Association, New York City Bar Association Constitution, February 15, 1870 Samuel Tilden, the first vice president of the Association Following the trials of the Tweed Ring, William M. Evarts, a well- known lawyer who had successfully defended President Andrew Johnson during his impeachment hearings and later served as Attorney General, was elected the Association's first president, a post which he would hold for nine years. Samuel Tilden, a national political leader and an outspoken critic of government corruption, was elected vice president. The Association quickly lent its public support to government reform in New York and its leading members played pivotal roles in many of the important reform battles of the time, including a large-scale corruption investigation of Tammany Hall in the 1870s. Tilden and other powerful members of the Association, including Joseph H. Choate, Henry Nicoll, Wheeler H. Peckham, and Charles O'Conor, who was appointed special state attorney in the investigation, were primarily responsible for obtaining convictions against \\"Boss\\" Tweed and other Tammany Hall associates, including Mayor A. Oakley Hall, for the embezzlement of an estimated $75 million to $200 million (though the investigation and trial were never officially endorsed by the New York City Bar).Martin, p. 123 In 1873, the Bar's Committee on the Judiciary, under Peckham's leadership, submitted a report on judicial corruption to the legislature that led to the removal of four notorious New York judges: Albert Cardozo, John McCunn, D.P. Ingraham, and George Barnard. 1880 to 1900 Thomas Nast cartoon of Tilden and Tweed, 1876 In the middle of the 1870s, the reform movement in New York lost momentum: the Association was unable to advance a referendum to restore the state system of selecting judges to appointment rather than election, or to convince the state legislature to consider passing laws reforming the municipal government of major cities. Many of the organization's founding members retired from active participation: Tilden ceased to play an active role in the Association following an unsuccessful run for President of the United States against Rutherford B. Hayes, while Evarts left to become Secretary of State in the new administration and Nicoll and O'Conor retired amidst scandals surrounding their private practices.Martin, p. 128-132 In the ensuing years, the Association largely receded from political life, and concerned itself with more administrative projects: the reform of admissions standards for the bar and, in 1877, the establishment by Association members of the New York State Bar Association.Martin, p. 138 The Association's main substantive victory in these years was to successfully lobby the New York State Legislature to defeat David Dudley Field's codification of civil law, a measure which many‚Äîespecially Association president and Field rival James Coolidge Carter‚Äîopposed on ideological grounds.Martin, p. 152 In 1896, the Association moved into its current landmark House on West 44th Street, which it commissioned from the prominent architect Cyrus L.W. Eidlitz. 1900 to 1920 In the early twentieth century, the Association's leadership was older than in the early years, and more partisan in its loyalty to the Republican Party. As a result, those lawyers interested in bipartisan government reform became more involved in organizations such as the Citizens' Union and the Good Government Club, and the Association's activities increasingly looked inward. 1920 to 1940 Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court Charles Evans Hughes, president from 1927 to 1929 In the years following the end of the First World War the Association was able to improve its public image and restore its political prestige. In one of the most famous incidents in the Bar's history, former Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court Charles Evans Hughes led the Association in public opposition to a decision by the New York State Legislature to expel five assemblymen elected in 1919 on the Socialist Party ticket. The Association published a resolution condemning the Assembly's decision on the front page of several leading national newspapers and, in the following days, sent a committee of five, headed by Hughes, to the Legislature in Albany where they confronted the Speaker, Thaddeus Sweet, and distributed letters of protest. The event made national news, earned the Association an unprecedented national following, and helped overturn a public image of the Bar as politically disengaged. When Hughes became President of the Association in 1927 he worked to increase both the Association's relationship with the public and its role in legal reform, establishing a series of radio broadcast lectures entitled The Fundamentals of the Law and playing a leading role in the regulation of frivolous personal injury lawsuits and the reform of the state's bankruptcy laws.Martin, p. 227-229 Hughes' successor, Charles Burlingham, with the cooperation of then- Governor Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Judge Samuel Seabury, led the Association a year later in a city-wide investigation of judicial corruption and court fixing under Tammany mayor Jimmy Walker which led to indictment of two judges and the disbarment of sixteen attorneys in 1930.Martin, p. 230 Seabury, himself chair of the Association's judiciary committee and later its president, went on in the 1930s to lead major investigations that led to the disbarment of New York County District Attorney Thomas Crain and the removal from office of Walker himself, though the Association itself played only a supporting role in the investigations. In 1937 women were made eligible for membership in the Association, and by the late 1930s, the Association's membership had more than doubled since its low point two decades earlier.Martin, p. 245 1940 to 1960 For much of World War II, the Association's activities were limited due to the employment of many members in the armed services and the United States War Department and the general priority given to the war effort. However, in the years immediately following the war membership again grew under the leadership of president Harrison Tweed. Tweed, who was a grandson of William Evarts (and no relation to \\"Boss\\" Tweed), made significant gains in membership by promoting social activities and also largely reorganized the Association into its current form, appointing a permanent executive director and establishing rotating membership for the Bar's growing number of committees. Henry Stimson, Secretary of War and president of the Bar from 1937 to 1939 The Association vocally opposed the investigations of Senator Joseph McCarthy and the House Un-American Activities Committee into suspected communist affiliations of government employees. When the American Bar Association, inspired by the Smith Act, passed a resolution in 1950 recommending that states require loyalty oaths of all lawyers admitted to the bar, the New York City Bar Association soundly defeated a similar resolution proposed by several members. Some members of the Association, including president Robert P. Patterson and his successor, Whitney North Seymour, were openly critical of loyalty oaths and of the tactics of McCarthy, and president Allen T. Klots began an Association initiative to provide legal representation to government employees questioned under the new loyalty programs.Martin, p. 263-4, 282 The Association was also a prominent critic of the controversial Bricker Amendment, intended to limit the power of the President to enter into foreign treaties.Martin, p. 289 Throughout the McCarthy era, several special committees of the Bar published reports that were harshly critical of the government's loyalty and security programs, culminating in a national study of the legal issues raised by loyalty investigations led by president Dudley Bonsal.Martin, p. 283 Throughout much of the late 1950s and 1960s, the Association continued to improve its organization, acquiring an administrative and library staff of 120 by 1969 and gradually increasing the number of specialized committees it supported.Martin, p. 292 It also invested considerable energy in the reorganization of the legal system. The Association published several landmark studies in these years, including a report on privacy entitled Privacy and Freedom by its Committee on Science and the Law and a groundbreaking report on family court by a special committee chaired by Oscar M. Ruebhausen, many of whose recommendations were later adopted.Martin, p. 296-8 1960 to 1980 The Association was actively engaged in the social movements and debates of the late 1960s, hosting Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Earl Warren to speak at a time when the American Bar Association was still resistant to civil rights legislation, and sponsoring several committees which supported the legality of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Association itself became more egalitarian in these years, electing its first female member of the executive committee in 1972 and democratizing access to the Bar by allowing mail-in ballots for executive elections and eliminating the requirement that new members be nominated by current members.Jeffrey B. Morris. Making Sure We are True to Our Founders: The Association of the Bar of the City of New York, 1980-1995. New York, NY: Fordham University Press, 1997, p. 36 The Association also actively advocated for the liberalization of abortion laws, civilian oversight of the New York City Police Department, and the modernization of New York State's Mental Hygiene Law. Cyrus Vance, president of the Bar from 1974 to 1976 As Earl Warren stated in a speech in 1963, upon accepting honorary membership in the Association: \\"there is no Bar Association I know in this country or any other that has contributed more to legal history or to the jurisprudence of our country than this great Association.\\" Morris, True, p.7 Beginning in the late 1960s, the Association also began to participate more actively in national legal debates. Presidents Bernard Botein and Francis T. P. Plimpton successfully led a coalition of legislators, lawyers, and law professors in opposition to President Richard Nixon's nomination of Clement Haynsworth and G. Harold Carswell to the Supreme Court for their poor record on civil rights and labor rights. A newly established Sex and the Law Committee, chaired first by Orville Schell and later Ruth Bader Ginsburg, became a leading advocate for the Equal Rights Amendment and gay rights. The Association also became deeply involved in the Watergate investigation, publishing a series of reports and other materials calling for the impeachment of Richard Nixon. After Nixon was pardoned by Gerald Ford in 1974, the Bar's grievance committee, led by Arthur L. Liman, successfully campaigned to have Nixon disbarred in New York‚Äîthe first time Nixon was ever legally found guilty of any malfeasance in connection with Watergate.Morris, p. 52 Under the leadership of Cyrus Vance the Association was also finally able to substantially reform New York State's process of choosing judges. Vance was head of a task force under Governor Hugh Carey that drafted three proposed state constitutional amendments that established a system of gubernatorial merit appointment of New York Court of Appeals judges and created a centralized court administration‚Äîgoals the Association had sought since its inception a century earlier.Morris, p. 55 These amendments were passed by the voters in 1977. 1980 to 2000 In the early 1980s, under presidents Oscar M. Ruebhausen and Louis A. Craco, the Association worked to improve its relationship with broader segments of the legal profession. The Judiciary Committee began working more closely with local bar associations in Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island in the evaluation of local judicial candidates, and the organization significantly increased its outreach to small law firms and sole practitioners. Craco also expanded the Association's involvement in pro bono legal work, creating the Volunteers of Legal Service, a program that facilitated representation by large law firms for low-income clients. VOLS, as the program was known, represented clients in criminal justice prosecutions and civil matters such as landlord-tenant disputes and family law, and also addressed problems of growing concern in the 1980s. The VOLS AIDS project began in 1988, and the VOLS Legalization Support Project in 1989 to assist New York's growing population of undocumented immigrants.Morris, p. 109 In the late 1980s and 1990s the Association increased its involvement in national issues. In May 1987, the Association decided to evaluate all future nominees to the United States Supreme Court, and subsequently opposed President Ronald Reagan's nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court. It also stepped up efforts to increase its own diversity. Under presidents Sheldon Oliensis and Conrad K. Harper, the Association developed an active policy \\"of inclusion and diversity with respect to the composition of its staff, its membership, the chairs and members of its committees and its officers,\\" which prioritized the recruitment of women and minorities and the encouragement of similar programs in large private law firms.Morris, p. 141 Notes References and further reading * Barrows, Chester L.

Russia had intended to use the island as a coaling station. While the British government was alarmed by rumours of a secret agreement between Russia and Korea, these rumours did not reach the British Cabinet until after the decision to occupy Geomundo had been taken.Lensen, G. A. (1989) Balance of Intrigue: International Rivalry in Korea & Manchuria, 1884‚Äì1899. University Press of Florida (2 vols.). Vol. 1: p. 54. The port was taken to establish a British port in the Far East outside China in the event of a war with Russia, to mitigate the harmful potential of possible Chinese neutrality. In official statements, the British government claimed that the occupation had been undertaken to preempt Russian annexation of the islands. In response, diplomats such as the then French minister to Japan and newspapers such as the Novoe Vremiya speculated that Russia would counterbalance the British occupation by seizing Port Lazarev (Wonsan) or Jeju Island.Lensen, Vol. 1, pp. 57‚Äì58. Russia threatened to occupy parts of Korea, in response to British actions. After receiving assurances from the Russians that they would not occupy any part of Korea the British withdrew. The proposal to occupy the islands had been considered earlier by the British Cabinet, in July 1875, but was rejected by Foreign Secretary Lord Derby as setting a poor precedent.

Originally announced on August 4, 2010 by Colorado Governor Bill Ritter and Lance Armstrong as the Quiznos Pro Challenge, the event carried on the state's cycling legacy, which was most notably highlighted by the Coors Classic that ran from 1980 to 1988. On February 4, 2011 Richard E. Schaden, founder of Quiznos and the event's co-chairman, announced the investment of an initial $10 million to secure the initial growth and longevity of the race. The USA Pro Cycling Challenge was one of only three current 2.HC rated races in the United States (along with the Tour of California, and the Tour of Utah), and was considered one of the most important pro cycling races in the U.S. After the 2015 edition, Schaden was unable to find a title sponsor for the 2016 edition, and subsequently left as an investor. The organizers were hoping to find a new investor to bring the race back for a 2017 edition, but the race folded after the 2015 edition. *Distance: 992 km  Winners  History =2011 edition= In 2011, the event took place between August 22‚Äì28, 2011 and featured 16 professional cycling teams consisting of 135 riders; including the top three riders of the 2011 Tour de France: Cadel Evans, Andy Schleck and Fr√§nk Schleck. Riders traveled 518 miles and climbed 36,250 total feet at altitudes of upwards of 12,000 feet during the seven days of competition. The race received 25 hours of national television airtime on Versus and the NBC Sports Network and was seen by over one million people worldwide. On-air commentary was provided by Tour de France announcers Paul Sherwen, Phil Liggett and Bob Roll. Americans swept the podium, with Levi Leipheimer winning the race, Christian Vande Velde finishing second, and Tejay van Garderen finishing third. =2012 edition= For 2012, the 683-mile race featured 42,000 feet of climbing, nine mountain passes (three of which exceed 12,000 feet), and three mountain top finishes.

It was first described in 1989, and has been recognized in the related literature as a fundamental paradox in multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) and decision analysis since then.  Description  The decision-making paradox was first described in 1989, and further elaborated in the 2000 book by Triantaphyllou on multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) / multi-criteria decision making (MCDM). It arises from the observation that different decision-making methods, both normative and descriptive, yield different results, when fed with exactly the same decision problem and data. It has been recognized in the related literature as a fundamental paradox in multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) / multi-criteria decision making (MCDM), and decision analysis since then. In a study reported in International Journal of Decision Support Systems and Multi-Criteria Decision Making: A Comparative Study, the following investigation was undertaken. Since in the beginning it was assumed that the best method is not known, the problem of selecting the best method was solved by successively using different methods. The methods used in that study were the weighted sum model (WSM), the weighted product model (WPM), and two variants of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). It was found that when a method was used, say method X (which is one of the previous four methods), the conclusion was that another method was best (say, method Y). When method Y was used, then another method, say method Z, was suggested as being the best one, and so on. Two evaluative criteria were used to formulate the previous decision-making problem, actually, an MCDM problem. The first criterion was based on the premise that a method which claims to be accurate in multi-dimensional problems (for which different units of measurement are used to describe the alternatives), should also be accurate in single-dimensional problems. For such problems, the weighted sum model (WSM) is the widely accepted approach, thus their results were compared with the ones derived from the WSM. The second evaluative criterion was based on the situation: alternative A, is evaluated as the best alternative, compared to the non-optimal alternative B. If B is replaced by a worse one, one should expect that alternative A remains the best alternative, under normal conditions where the weights of the two evaluative criteria in all possible combinations always add equal to 1. If not it is known as a \\"ranking reversal\\".  Methods affected  The following multi-criteria decision-making methods have been confirmed to exhibit this paradox:The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and some of its variants, the weighted product model (WPM), the ELECTRE (outranking) method and its variants and the TOPSIS method.  Other methods  Other methods that have not been tested yet but may exhibit the same phenomenon include the following: * The analytic network process (ANP). * The PROMETHEE (outranking) method. * Multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT). * Dominance-based rough set approach (DRSA) * Aggregated indices randomization method (AIRM) * Nonstructural fuzzy decision support system (NSFDSS) * Grey relational analysis (GRA) * Superiority and inferiority ranking method (SIR method) * Potentially all pairwise rankings of all possible alternatives (PAPRIKA) * Value analysis (VA) A key role in this quest is played by the study of rank reversals in decision making.

On June 7, 1971, the Allegheny Airlines Convair CV-580 operating the flight crashed on approach to Tweed New Haven Regional Airport, New Haven County, Connecticut. The accident was notable in that all but one person survived the initial impact, however 27 people died in the subsequent fire, after failing to open the emergency exit. Only the first officer and 2 passengers survived. Poor visibility in the cabin, a lack of emergency lighting, unclear emergency door instructions, and a lack of additional crew personnel to assist in evacuation were all cited as factors in the high death toll.  Aircraft and crew  The accident aircraft was a Convair 440 manufactured in 1956. It was purchased by Allegheny Airlines in 1962 from another airline. The aircraft was modified to an Allison Prop Jet Convair CV-580 in 1967. The aircraft's most recent airworthiness certificate was issued in November 1967. The crew on the accident flight consisted of Captain David Gordon Eastridge, aged 39, and First Officer James Alford Walker, aged 34. The captain had over 12,000 hours of total flight time, including an estimated 3,600 hours in the Convair CV-580. First Officer Walker had over 4,000 hours of total flight time. The flight attendant was Judith L. Manning, aged 27.National Transportation Safety Board 1972, pp. 45‚Äì46. Accident The flight departed Washington D.C. at 7:14 a.m. on an IFR flight plan. Five minutes later, at 7:19 a.m., the crew cancelled the IFR plan, and proceeded directly to New London via visual flight rules. The weather around the airport was foggy, with poor visibility. When approaching Groton-New London Airport, the crew made three missed approaches before successfully landing, approximately one hour behind schedule.National Transportation Safety Board 1972, p. 4. Twelve passengers disembarked at Groton. The flight took on 14 new passengers, as well as cargo. The flight departed the gate at approximately 9:33 a.m., bound for New Haven. At 9:48 a.m., the Tweed New Haven Regional Airport tower controller gave the flight a choice of either Runway 2 or Runway 20 for landing. Flight 485 responded: \\"O.K., the way it looks we will take two. It will be all right.\\" The flight was cleared for a downwind landing on Runway 2. As noted in the NTSB accident report, downwind landings at Tweed New Haven Regional Airport were prohibited by an Allegheny Airlines company directive.National Transportation Safety Board 1972, p. 5. The first officer called out airspeed and descent rate as the flight descended past the minimum descent height of 380 feet, which was verbally acknowledged by the captain, who then told the first officer to \\"keep a sharp eye out here.\\" Approximately 18 seconds later, with the aircraft still descending, the first officer remarked: \\"You can't see down through this stuff.\\" The captain responded that he could see the water. The first officer exclaimed that they were \\"right over the water.\\" No apparent attempt to stop the descent was made. Approximately 3.5 seconds after the first officer's remark, an abrupt voice said \\"Hold it.\\" The recording ended approximately 2 seconds later.National Transportation Safety Board 1972, p. 6. According to the NTSB accident report, the aircraft struck three adjoining beach cottages at an altitude of approximately 29 feet m.s.l. The local controller noted a fireball and smoke at approximately 9:50 a.m. According to the accident report: \\"Fire developed immediately upon initial impact.\\" Investigation =Captain Eastridge's decisions= Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board analysed the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and flight data recorder (FDR) for information as to the cause of the accident, and found it was likely Captain Eastridge made several decisions during the course of the flight which indicated the time of the journey was important to him.National Transportation Safety Board 1972, pp. 23‚Äì24. Prior to take-off from Washington D.C., Eastridge requested an amended flight plan from the Allegheny Airlines flight dispatcher. He asked the dispatcher to remove the planned refuelling at Groton from the flight itinerary, and asked ground crews at Washington D.C. to add more fuel to the aircraft. Investigators found this decision was likely made in case poor weather at the airport forced him to abandon a landing attempt and proceed directly to New Haven. When the flight departed from the gate, air traffic control (ATC) gave the aircraft permission to taxi to Runway 15. The flight crew then contacted ATC to request the use of Runway 3, which they were closer to. The NTSB report noted, \\"Time would have been saved if Runway 3 could have been utilized as it is closer to the company gate and more nearly aligned with the routing to be flown after take-off.\\" ATC approved this runway change, and cleared the aircraft for take-off. Shortly after take-off, the flight crew received clearance from ATC to initiate a 360 degree turn. Eastwood decided to cancel his instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan, and elected to fly using visual flight rules (VFR). The NTSB report noted, \\"The captain obviously was aware that if he proceeded VFR via the most direct course time could have been saved. Evidence indicates that this was his plan.\\" =Groton= The NTSB noted that the \\"Eastridge carried out the first portion of the flight exactly as planned.\\" Therefore, upon reaching Groton, where the weather was poor, Eastridge elected not to divert to an alternate airport or proceed direct to New Haven, but circle overhead until conditions improved. About 30 minutes after they began circling above the airport one third of the fuel available for holding had been consumed, and Eastridge approached the airport to attempt a landing. \\"Thinking ahead,\\" the NTSB noted, \\"about fuel requirements and down-line scheduled operations, the captain attempted to get his airplane onto the ground.\\"National Transportation Safety Board 1972, p. 25. But, because of the poor visibility, Eastridge decided that, to see the runway before landing, he would have to descend to within of the runway, far below the minimum descent altitude of . The NTSB report stated, \\"He decided to descend to about 200 feet, calculating that sufficient visibility would be available to permit a safe landing. Although such a procedure was not authorized, the captain believed that he could conduct the approach safely.\\" =Survivability= The NTSB determined the accident was survivable,National Transportation Safety Board 1972, p. 16. and the bodies of 15 of the 27 dead passengers were located near the rear service door, which could be manually opened by passengers. The door lock was found in the closed position. Medical examination was undertaken on 26 of the 27, and all had died from chemical asphyxiation or burns. The stewardess had also obtained fractures to the ribs, left clavicle and her third thoracic vertebrae.National Transportation Safety Board 1972, p. 17. The accident report stated many of the passengers may have tried to leave the aircraft, but were overcome in doing so. In their analysis of the accident, the NTSB stated that, \\"with the exception of the captain, who sustained fatal injuries on impact, everyone aboard this flight could have survived if rapid egress from the fire area had been possible or if flame propagation had been retarded.\\"National Transportation Safety Board 1972, pp. 32‚Äì33. They found that, because of the position of the bodies of the passengers, an unsuccessful attempt had been made to open the rear service door. The instructions, printed on the inside of the door, would have been difficult to read in the smoke. Investigators concluded the evacuation could have been more successful had another steward been aboard the aircraft. Although two cabin crew are legally required aboard a Convair CV-580, an exemption had been granted to Allegheny Airlines and several other carriers, permitting them to fly with one cabin crew. The Board stated they believed \\"the possibility for a greater number of survivors would have existed had a second cabin attendant been aboard this flight.\\" NTSB recommendations The NTSB made several recommendations to the Federal Aviation Administration. Most notable among these were recommendations regarding fire safety equipment, emergency lighting, and crew instructions to passengers regarding the location of emergency exits and evacuation procedures.National Transportation Safety Board 1972, p. 36. The Board suggested that flight attendants physically point to the location of each exit when conducting the pre-flight passenger safety briefing, to increase passenger retention. The Board also pointed to a need for emergency exit lighting, as well as clear, simple instruction for opening emergency exits, calling the instructions present on the accident aircraft \\"misleading.\\"National Transportation Safety Board 1972, p. 37. The Board also noted the limitations of the aircraft's non-precision approach equipment, suggesting that a more precise instrument landing system could have reduced the likelihood of an accident.

History Boxing has been a popular campus activity since the late 19th century. In the intramural tournament of 1879, future President Theodore Roosevelt faced C.S. Hanks in the lightweight championship and lost, after a controversial late hit by Hanks. According to historian Edmund Morris, the crowd started booing Hanks, prompting Roosevelt to put up his hands and shout ‚ÄúIt's alright, he didn‚Äôt hear [the bell]‚Äù. When Roosevelt campaigned for the Presidency, his supporters would frequently recall this anecdote as an early example of his extraordinary character.Edmund Morris. The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt. New York: Random House, 1979. Boxing became an official varsity sport in 1922, as per recommendation of the Harvard Athletic Committee, and Harvard boxers performed well against their Ivy League opponents (amassing a 25:11:4 record from 1930 to 1937). The team expanded during World War II, when all undergraduates were required to participate in intercollegiate boxing training as a way of improving wartime fitness. In 1961, the NCAA decided to discontinue boxing as an intercollegiate sport and the Harvard Boxing Team was replaced by the Harvard Boxing Club. Intramural tournaments continued until 1976 when Harvard banned them due to riotous crowd attendance, leaving the Harvard Boxing Club (in its current form) as the last remnant of the college‚Äôs proud boxing tradition. Notable coaches include Tommy Rawson, national amateur junior lightweight champion in 1929, who coached boxers such as Rocky Marciano, and coached at Harvard for 60 years from 1941-2001. Today The Harvard Boxing Club currently includes several dozen members, many of whom participate in the annual Harvard Boxing Club Exhibition Night (a tradition that was revived in 2009). The Club is now co-ed (since the merging of Harvard and Radcliffe College) and includes both undergraduates and graduates. The Harvard Boxing Club is managed by one undergraduate President and four undergraduate Captains. The Harvard Boxing Club is coached by former title-holding amateur fighter, Doug Yoffe, who assumed the position in 2001. Yoffe replaced Tommy Rawson‚Äîformer national amateur lightweight champion (with a 223-4 amateur record), former chairman of the Massachusetts Boxing Commission, and one-time trainer of boxing legend Rocky Marciano. Rawson had been ‚ÄúCoach‚Äù since 1941. The Club practices two hours per day, six days per week. Skill days (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) are typically led by the Coach, while conditioning days (Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday) are typically led by the Captains.

A new international terminal and passenger ramp opened in September 2015. Initial design plan, released in 2013  History  =Korean War= The Republic of Korea Army Capital Division captured Wonsan Airfield on 10 October 1950. On 13 October, Major General Field Harris, commander of the 1st Marine Air Wing, flew into the airfield, followed the next day by VMF-312 and other elements of Marine Aircraft Group 12. The airfield was used by the United States Marine Corps and USAF under the designation K-25. By 12 October the USAF's Cargo Combat Command was flying supplies into the airfield. UN forces evacuated Wonsan in December 1950. The airfield was rendered unusable for the remainder of the war by the Blockade of Wonsan. =Modernisation= In July 2013, Kim Jong-un approved plans for a complete redesign of the airport, turning it into an international airport for civilian use. The new airport was designed by the Chinese architectural firm PLT Planning & Architecture. The redesign will include two 36,000-square-foot oval-shaped terminals, one serving domestic flights and one serving international flights, that will each contain six gates and several duty-free stores. The runways will also be extended to 3500 metres. It is expected to cost US$200 million. On 24 September 2015, the first commercial civilian flight landed at Wonsan Airport as a part of an aviation-related tour with thirty passengers. Photographs of the inaugural flight reveal a very much redesigned terminal building, doing away with the original dual-terminal circular layout. The new terminal has a single L-shaped building. It is reported that the airport cost around $200 million to build, with most of the work being carried out by the military. In July 2015, the first major event, an aeronautics display and contest, took place at the airport. In September 2016 the Wonsan Air Festival took place for the first time, with the Korean People's Army Air Force and the North Korean airline Air Koryo displaying a number of their aircraft.North Korea is Hosting its First Air Show February 18, 2016 Popular Mechanics Retrieved February 3, 2017North Korea's Wonsan Friendship Air Festival USA Today Retrieved February 3, 2017North Korea shows off fighter jets at its first international air show September 26, 2016 International Business Times Retrieved February 3, 2017 A second edition was planned for September 2017 but it was cancelled amidst international tensions.North Korea cancels 2017 Wonsan Air Show August 25, 2017 NHK Retrieved September 7, 2017North Korea scraps Wonsan Air Show as sanctions tighten August 28, 2017 South China Morning Post Retrieved September 8, 2017 Asiana Airlines became the first foreign airline to operate to the newly reconstructed airport at Wonsan. Air Koryo previously operated charter services from the original Wonsan Airport to South Korea prior to the end of the Sunshine policy. In July 2018 a C-17 of the US Air Force's 204th Airlift Squadron collected 55 cases of human remains from Wonsan. It is thought that these are remains of US or other UN servicemen from the Korean War. The C-17 then flew to Osan Air Base in South Korea. Infrastructure Wonsan Airport has two runways. A new runway was constructed parallel to the existing main runway, which is 375 metres longer. The existing runway was converted into a taxiway. A new terminal opened in 2015 to allow the airport to serve commercial passenger flights. The new construction features 2 jetbridges and a newly designed apron that can accommodate 12 commercial aircraft at any one time.

Beginnings of the Navy helicopter gunship Prior to the Vietnam War, the helicopter was a valued tool within the United States Army for reconnaissance, Search and Rescue (SAR), and medical evacuation of wounded (MEDEVAC).HELIS.com, Helicopter History Website, \\"Gunship Helicopters\\", http://www.helis.com/types/gunship.php Helicopters within the United States Navy were used for Search and Rescue (SAR), Vertical replenishment (VERTREP), Marine amphibious envelopment, and, experimentally, as mine sweepers.

In 1965, the US Navy began joint operations off the southern coast of South Vietnam in support of the growing war. In the same year, the Navy began limited river operations in the Mekong Delta, disrupting the Viet Cong's lines of communications, locating supply caches, and eliminating tax collecting stations. Based on the \\"Brown-water\\" Navy's early success, a commitment was made to continue river operations on a full-scale basis in the Mekong Delta. It was also determined that key to the survival of the boats operating in the rivers would be close air support.Navy Seawolves ‚Äì Early History, HA(L)-3 Official Website, http://www.seawolf.org/history/hal3_history.asp Initially, the Brown-water Navy was supported by elements of the US Army's 145th Combat Aviation Battalion who had greater experience in helicopter gunship operations and tactics. Operating off a \\"Mothership\\", the , the Army and Navy worked together on Operation Jackstay. Although the joint effort was a success, it was felt that Naval Aviators and Aircrewman would be more suitable for the mission, especially since the mission would require the pilots and crews to operate off the deck of ships in all weather conditions, day and night. This, coupled with Army's pilots and aircrews lack of training in shipboard operations, identified a need for a dedicated, United States Navy, helicopter gunship program in Vietnam.Navy Seawolves ‚Äì Early History, HA(L)-3 Official Website, http://www.seawolf.org/history/hal3_history.asp  The birth of the HA(L)-3 and the Seawolves  In 1966, rotary wing support was originated as part of the response to the ongoing war in South Vietnam.http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/hc-1.htm Starting with Helicopter Combat Support Squadron ONE (HC-1), detachments of helicopter gunships transferred to the Navy to conduct combat operations in the Mekong Delta region of South Vietnam. HC-1 operated two-aircraft detachments of Army UH-1B gunships, staged from shore bases and patrol craft tenders. Providing a quick reaction, close air support (CAS) role for units of the Brown-water Navy, the effectiveness of the helicopter attack mission was quickly realized. In response, the Navy began to widen the mission requirements.http://bluehawksofhal-5.org/ This created a need for a specific Squadron in support of the mission requirements. In April 1967, HC-1 was divided into four separate units, Helicopter Combat Support Squadron THREE (Navy Vertical Replenishment), Helicopter Combat Support Squadron FIVE and Helicopter Combat Support Squadron SEVEN (Navy Combat Search and Rescue) and Helicopter Attack Squadron (Light) 3 (HAL-(3)), nicknamed the Seawolves.http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/hc-1.htm In 1966, the Navy sent a message fleet-wide, asking for volunteer Naval Aviators to man HA(L)-3. From the response, eighty Aviators were chosen to be the first \\"Seawolves\\" and transferred to Vietnam. On 1 April 1967, HA(L)-3 was officially established in South Vietnam under the command of LCDR Joseph B. Howard.Navy Seawolves ‚Äì Early History, HA(L)-3 Official Website, http://www.seawolf.org/history/hal3_history.asp The wolf on the patch was inspired by the lion logo on a L√∂wenbr√§u beer can; a trident as a symbol for the Navy was added, and a shield with a spade as a symbol for death with red and yellow colours as found on the flag of South Vietnam.

On 31 October 1966, two Navy boats encountered a superior force of over 80 boats transferring a Viet Cong battalion. Encountering fierce resistance from them, the Navy boat commanders requested close air support. Scrambling and arriving within approximately fifteen minutes, the Seawolves would claim 16 Viet Cong boats sunk or destroyed.Helicopter Attack Squadron (Light) Three ‚Äì The Seawolves ‚Äì Past‚Ä¶Present‚Ä¶Future?, U.S. Classified Memo, 1 December 1971, declassified 25 October 1972 The squadron was activated on 1 April 1967 at a commissioning ceremony at Vung Tau with four detachments: Detachment 1 (formerly HC-1 Detachment 29) on ; Detachment 2 (formerly HC-1 Detachment 27) at Nh√† B√® Base; Detachment 3 (formerly HC-1 Detachment 25) at Vƒ©nh Long Airfield and Detachment 4 (formerly HC-1 Detachment 21) on .

It is the sequel to Torchlight, and features peer-to-peer multiplayer support and extended modding capabilities. The game was released for OS X on February 2, 2015, and for Linux on March 4, 2015. Ports for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One were released September 3 2019 and were developed by Panic Button. Torchlight II takes place in a fantasy world where the player character can be any of four classes, each with different skills and abilities. The plot starts with the destruction of the town of Torchlight, at the hands of the Alchemist from the first game, and has the character following the trail of destruction left in the Alchemist's wake as he searches for a cure to his illness which has driven him insane. The sequel to the first game was originally going to be an MMORPG however Torchlight II was released with both single-player and multi-player support, as the company felt they could release this much faster than the planned MMO. The game received mostly positive reviews from critics. A planned sequel, Torchlight III, was scheduled and released in 2020. Gameplay Like the original Torchlight, Torchlight II features randomly generated dungeons for the player to explore, and numerous types of monsters to fight for experience and loot. Torchlight II maintains the same basic gameplay as its predecessor, but features overland areas with multiple hub towns, and a longer campaign. Other new features include time of day cycles, weather effects, and a redesigned user interface. Also unlike the first game, some weapons and armor can only be used by certain classes, as opposed to all of them. Players are able to customize character appearance with choice of sex, face, hair style and hair color. Additionally, several elements from the first game return, such as pets (but now with expanded options and basic customization available) and fishing. A retirement system was originally planned, similar or identical to the one in the first game, but was replaced with the current New Game Plus mode. The game features four playable character classes. Each class has 3 skill trees to choose from which enable customization within each class. The three classes from the original Torchlight do not return as playable characters, and are instead presented in the game world as NPCs. =Classes= Engineer: The Engineer (formerly known as the Railman) is a heavy melee fighter who uses ember-powered steampunk technology. Skill Trees: Blitz, Construction, Aegis. Outlander: The Outlander is a wandering nomad who uses ranged weapons and \\"low magic\\". Skill Trees: Warfare, Lore, Sigil. Berserker: The Berserker uses quick attacks and animal- themed special powers, Skill Trees: Hunter, Tundra, Shadow. Embermage: The Embermage is a highly trained spell-casting class with elemental attacks. Skill Trees: Inferno, Frost, Storm. =Multiplayer= As stated in the trailer for Torchlight II, Runic games has announced that they \\"heard their [the fans'] ideas\\" and criticism concerning the fact that the first Torchlight was a lonely experience without co-op. In addition to single-player mode, an all- new cooperative multiplayer mode has been added, supporting both internet and LAN play. Each multiplayer game can host up to 6 players, and loot drops separately for each player. Optional PVP (player versus player) has been confirmed by Runic. Torchlight II requires a Runic Games account to play in online multiplayer games. Plot Years after the end of the original Torchlight, The Alchemist (playable character in the first game) becomes corrupted by the Ember Blight coming from the Heart of Ordrak, the evil being who had been the source of the corruption under the town of Torchlight, and then destroys the town. The player character takes on a quest to stop this villain, who is using Ordrak's power to disturb the balance between the world's six elements. As the game progresses, the player treks across large geographical areas, corresponding to three \\"acts\\" of the story and an epilogue. Act I, Wake of the Alchemist, is set in the mountainous Estherian Steppes, and Act II takes the player to a desert known as the Mana Wastes, and Act III takes place in Grunnheim, a haunted forest that contains the ruins of an ancient dwarven civilization. An Imperial Camp serves as the player's town. Development Though the original Torchlight received positive reviews, the game's lack of any multiplayer modes was a near-universal criticism of the title by critics and fans alike. Prior to the release of the first game, Runic Games had announced plans to develop a MMORPG set in the Torchlight game world to follow the release of the single player game. However, in August 2010, Runic announced they were developing Torchlight II, a sequel which was conceived not only as a way to give the series multiplayer support, but also to give Runic \\"more experience with making a multiplayer Torchlight.\\" Some of the work on Torchlight II is intended to carry over to Runic Games' upcoming Torchlight MMORPG, which the company plans to focus on following the release of the sequel. Runic Games originally estimated the PC version's release date to be sometime in 2011, but in November 2011 company president Travis Baldree announced the game release date would be pushed back to 2012 to allow time for further polishing and beta testing. In late 2010, Runic Games' increased involvement in the Xbox Live Arcade port of the first Torchlight game caused a delay in the development of the sequel, but memory and loading time optimizations developed for the port led to improvements in the PC version of Torchlight II. Unlike its predecessor, Torchlight II features cinematic sequences, which are produced by Klei Entertainment, the developer of Don't Starve, Eets and Shank. =Closed beta= In May 2012, Runic Games announced that they would run a closed beta stress test from May 18 until May 24. A limited number of beta keys were given out to users who had created their Runic Games account prior to the beta start date. =GUTS editor= In April 2013, a patch to Torchlight II was released to add in the GUTS editor that allows users to alter the game's content and create user modifications. Along with this included new support for Steam Workshop, adding a Steam client-based automated mod distribution system to the game. Release In April 2012, Torchlight II became available for pre-purchase through Steam, those who pre- purchased received the original Torchlight free. On August 30, 2012, company president Travis Baldree announced on the official forums for Runic Games that the game was to be released on September 20, 2012. Perfect World announced that Torchlight II would be coming to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One consoles in 2019, with Panic Button handling the ports. These console versions are planned for release on September 3, 2019. Sequel Following the release of Torchlight II, Travis Baldree and Erich Schaefer left Runic Games to start their own studio. As a result the company was forced to cancel the game they were working on and lay off several staff, and in the aftermath, they changed their focus to Hob. In 2016, Max Schaefer departed as well, to found Echtra Games. In 2017, shortly after the release of Hob, Runic Games was closed down by their parent company. In 2018, Max Schaefer announced Echtra Games, which included several former Runic and Blizzard North developers, was working on Torchlight Frontiers, the planned free-to-play Torchlight MMORPG. After a lengthy closed alpha during 2019, Echtra Games revealed in January 2020 that the game was to be completely rebranded as Torchlight III, a more traditional follow-up to the previous games. Torchlight III will be a premium game as its predecessors were and all microtransactions from the F2P iteration of the title will be removed. Reception =Critical reception= Torchlight II received favorable reviews; on aggregate review website Metacritic the game attains an overall score of 88 out of 100 based on reviews from 67 professional critics. Game Informer stated that \\"Torchlight II is an excellent game no matter how you slice it... the margin between [it and Diablo III] is razor-thin ‚Äì and I have to give the nod to Torchlight II.\\" IGN praised the game saying, \\"Torchlight II doesn't do anything radically new, but does everything incredibly well. It fits all the pieces of varied monster behavior, interesting items, excellent skill design and random surprises together into a near-perfect formula, where the action never stops and rewards are never far away.\\" GameTrailers praised the low price point saying, \\"it's a polished adventure that easily justifies its reasonable $20 price tag.\\" One of the criticisms of the game is the lack of innovation. GameSpot stated, \\"Torchlight II doesn't innovate and it doesn't surprise, and the genre may need an infusion of new ideas if it's going to stay vital.\\" =Sales= The game sold over 1 million copies in 2012. As of 2015, the game has sold almost 3 million copies.

The Big Pasture Plateau is a tourist destination both in winter as a ski resort and in summer as a place for relaxation. History There is evidence that man has been present on Big Pasture Plateau since prehistoric times. In Medieval times the plateau was used for pasturing. The oldest huts, which date from the 16th century, are nearly identical to the present Preskar Hut (). The hut is oval, covered from roof to ground with shingles, without windows, doors, or a chimney. In the winter of 1931‚Äì1932 a new form of tourism began, known as bajtarstvo, which involved renting the huts in the winter when there was no pasturing.

Tricks are performed by swinging, wrapping and throwing the meteor about the body.  Origins  The meteor is based on the Chinese meteor hammer, a bolo-like weapon made from stones and rope. Approximately 1500 years ago, this hunting weapon began its transition into a performing art. The Chinese circus tradition has featured meteors with brightly colored balls, glass bowls filled with colored water, or pans of flaming oil in place of the stone weights.Thomas, Rhys (1999). The Meteor Book. Flaming Sparrow. . In Shaolin schools, the water meteor made a useful training aid once a student had gained a certain level of skill. These water meteors consisted of a length of chain with two inward facing bowls for heads. These bowls were then filled with water (or occasionally, sand), in order to train a smooth technique and gain control over the weapon. When the meteor was spinning fast enough, the water would be held in the bowls, with the intention being not to spill any. In China where this technique was originally developed, once a student had practiced for several years and gained mastery of the meteor, then they could progress to fire meteors. Cirque du Soleil's Varekai features water meteors as an act.  Fire meteor  The traditional fire meteors were essentially the same as the water meteors, except that instead of containing water, the bowls were instead filled with fuel. This fuel was then lit, and the meteor spun exactly as before, looking like a pair of real harnessed meteors. It is also a dangerous weapon to behold, because one slight mistake could send flaming fuel around in a radius in excess of 20 feet. Modern fire meteors are commonly made similar to the monkey fist meteors, which is made of kevlar, cotton or other natural fiber rope, then connected by chains or rope; also made of kevlar, cotton or natural fiber. The natural fiber, Technora or kevlar rope is necessary as synthetic ropes will melt rapidly, and the natural fiber ropes will also need to be replaced often as well. The Technora or kevlar rope works much better as it is designed to take stress and resist high temperatures.  Freestyle meteor  Freestyle Meteor refers to the use of the meteor weapon (used in martial arts) in a more visually stunning manner, rather than a combative way. This makes freestyle meteor one of the flow arts.

It was fought between an English privateer squadron under George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland, who had set out his fortunes by large-scale privateering, and a squadron of 5 Spanish galleys commanded by Francisco Coloma tasked with patrolling the Portuguese coast against privateers. While anchored off the Berlengas, the English ships were surprised by the Spanish galleys, which succeeded in taking one English ship and rescuing two prizes. Expedition Having undertaken naval expeditions to the coasts of Spain in 1587, 1588, and 1589,Barrow, pp. 440‚Äì448 in the spring of 1591, the Earl of Cumberland sailed to Cape St. Vincent in a new privateering campaign with one royal ship, the 600-ton galleon Garland, and four of his own, the 260-ton Sampson, the Golden Noble, Allegarta, and the small pinnace Discovery.Bourne p. 267Campbell, p. 208 Sir William Monson of Stuart, later Admiral of the Royal Navy, was his second in command. Off the Spanish coast they took a pair of Dutch ships sailing from Lisbon with spices. Though the Dutch Republic was allied with England against the Spanish Crown, the ships taken by the English squadron had the goods of Portuguese merchants on board.Southey, p. 9 The English squadron took further prizes: one ship loaded with wine and two with sugar, which were sent back to England. One of these ships had a leak in the hull and was forced to cast off. Its boarding crew was saved on the shore. The two other vessels met contrary winds and, lacking of provisions, were obliged to enter the port of A Coru√±a, where they were immediately taken.Campbell, p. 209 The English squadron, meanwhile, sailed to the Berlengas islands, a group of small islands off the Portuguese coast near the city of Peniche. There, the Earl of Cumberland ordered Monson to escort the Dutch prizes to England with Captain Peter Baily's Golden Noble. During the night, however, Cumberland's Garland and the other warships fell separated from Monson and the prizes. Battle The Golden Noble was discovered by a squadron of five Spanish galleys under Francisco Coloma, General of the Armada de Guarda Costa (Coast-guard armada). Archduke Albert, Spanish Viceroy of Portugal, noticed the presence on those waters of English privateers and had sent Coloma's squadron to sail the coast of Algarve till Cape St. Vincent and join forces with Alonso de Baz√°n's galleons.Fonseca, Lu√≠s Jos√© Torres Falc√£o da.

Taking advantage of the calm, the Spanish galleys rowed up, engaged and took the English ships after a bloody fight. Captain Peter Baily and the principal men were killed in the fight. Coloma captured the 14-gun, 150-man man-of-war Golden Noble and recovered the Dutch prizes, a caravel and a zabre, at the slight cost of two men killed. Cumberland heard the artillery of Monson's ship in distance, but he was unable to come in relief because of contrary winds. Aftermath After the action, Cumberland wrote to Archduke Albert requesting him that the English prisoners should be humanely treated or he would retaliate the injuries which they might suffer with \\"double severity\\" upon the Spaniards. Monson, who was among the prisoners, was carried to Portugal and imprisoned two years at Cascais and Lisbon,Goldsmith p. 141 together with 6 other officers, being the sailors and soldiers provided with new clothing and freed. Monson spent several months as a galley slave in the Leiva galley together with 100 other English captives. Two weeks after the encounter, a much larger English fleet under Lord Thomas Howard, dispatched to the Azores to capture the annual Spanish treasure convoy sailing from the Americas, was put to the flight at the Battle of Flores. The English galleon Revenge was captured by the Spanish and Portuguese ships, but later foundered in a storm.S√°iz Cidoncha, Carlos. Historia de la Pirater√≠a en Am√©rica Espa√±ola.

Herz's family was part of the small German-speaking minority of assimilated Jews in Prague, although Herz stated that she also spoke Czech. Her father was a merchant and her mother was highly educated and moved in circles of well-known writers. She had two sisters, including a twin sister, Mariana, and two brothers. Her parents ran a cultural salon where Herz, as a child, met writers including Franz Kafka and Franz Werfel, composers including Gustav Mahler, philosophers, and intellectuals such as Sigmund Freud. Herz once noted that \\"Kafka was a slightly strange man. He used to come to our house, sit and talk with my mother, mainly about his writing. He did not talk a lot, but rather loved quiet and nature. We frequently went on trips together. I remember that Kafka took us to a very nice place outside Prague.

Herz's sister Irma was married to Felix Weltsch, who was a prominent German-language Jewish philosopher, journalist, librarian, and Zionist who later worked as a librarian in Jerusalem after his emigration from Austria. Herz's older sister Irma taught her how to play the piano, which she studied diligently, and the Austrian-Jewish pianist Artur Schnabel, a friend of the family, encouraged her to pursue a career as a classical musician, a choice she decided to make. She went on to study under the Czech pianist V√°clav ≈†tƒõp√°n (1889-1944) and at the Prague German Conservatory of Music, where she was the youngest pupil. Herz married the businessman and amateur musician Leopold Sommer in 1931; the couple had a son, Stephan (later known as Raphael, 1937‚Äì2001).Greenberg, Louise. She began giving concerts and making a name for herself across Europe until the Nazis took over Prague, as they did not allow Jews to perform in public, join music competitions or teach non- Jewish pupils. Second World War After the invasion of Czechoslovakia, most of Herz-Sommer's family and friends emigrated to Palestine via Romania, including Max Brod and brother-in-law Felix Weltsch, but Herz-Sommer stayed in Prague to care for her ill mother, Sofie, aged 72; both women were arrested and Sofie Herz was murdered in a concentration camp. In July 1943 Herz was sent to Theresienstadt, where she played in more than 100 concerts along with other musicians, for prisoners and guards. She commented of her performances in the camp: > We had to play because the Red Cross came three times a year. The Germans > wanted to show its representatives that the situation of the Jews in > Theresienstadt was good. Whenever I knew that I had a concert, I was happy. > Music is magic. We performed in the council hall before an audience of 150 > old, hopeless, sick and hungry people. They lived for the music. It was like > food to them. If they hadn't come [to hear us], they would have died long > before. As we would have. Herz-Sommer was billeted with her son during their time at the camp; he was one of only a few children to survive Theresienstadt. Her husband died of typhus in Dachau, six weeks before the camp was liberated. Later life Pianists Alice Herz-Sommer (left) and Luiza Borac 2010 in London After the Soviet liberation of Theresienstadt in 1945, she and Raphael returned to Prague, and in March 1949 emigrated to Israel, to be reunited with some of her surviving family, including her twin sister, Mariana. Herz lived in Israel for almost 40 years, working as a music teacher at the Jerusalem Academy of Music, until emigrating to London in 1986. In London Herz-Sommer lived close to her family in a one-room flat in Belsize Park, visited almost daily by her closest friends, her grandson Ariel Sommer, and daughter-in-law Genevieve Sommer. She practised playing the piano three hours a day until the end of her life. She stated that optimism was the key to her life: > I look at the good. When you are relaxed, your body is always relaxed. When > you are pessimistic, your body behaves in an unnatural way. It is up to us > whether we look at the good or the bad. When you are nice to others, they > are nice to you.

Family Background Mykolay Charnetsky was born in the village of Semakivtsia, a hamlet in the Horodenka Raion in western Ukraine, on 14 December 1884. He came from a large family and was the eldest of nine children. Alexander and Parasceva Charnetsky and their children were devout members of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church which is in communion with the Bishop of Rome and is distinct from the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. Ukrainian seminary and priesthood From a young age, Mykolay had expressed a desire to become a priest and when he was 18 years of age, the Ukrainian Catholic Bishop Hryhory Khomyshyn (who was himself to be martyred) sent him to study at the Ukrainian College in Rome. After his ordination to the Catholic priesthood in 1909, Father Mykolay returned from Ukraine to Rome so that he might complete a Doctorate in Theology, which he did the following year. Upon completion of his doctorate, Father Mykolay returned to his homeland in order to teach Dogmatic theology and philosophy at the Ukrainian Catholic seminary in Ivano-Frankivsk (then called Stanislaviv) where he remained for the next nine years, also serving as spiritual director to any student who wished. Ministry as a Redemptorist For some time, Father Mykolay had desired to live a more austere life than that of a seminary professor. In 1913 the Belgian province of the Redemptorists had established a mission in Ukraine and this included a novitiate near Lviv for those interested in joining the congregation. Like Father Ivan Ziatyk who was to follow him some years later, Father Mykolay entered the novitiate in 1919. As he was already an ordained priest, after his first profession in 1920, Father Mykolay immediately began working in a nearby parish before being sent to teach at the minor seminary (for students in their teens) run by the Redemptorists. However, in 1926 the congregation opened a mission in the Volhynia region of northern Ukraine (then part of Poland), the main purpose of which was to promote a better relationship between Catholic and Orthodox Ukrainians. As Father Mykolay had been ordained in the Ukrainian Catholic Rite, he was well acquainted with the Liturgy and Christian spirituality as lived by those of the Orthodox churches and this gained him much respect amongst their people and clergy. His devotion to the people together with his tireless efforts at fostering Orthodox-Catholic relations caused Pope Pius XII to name him as titular bishop of Lebed and Apostolic Visitor to Ukrainian Catholics in the Volhynia region as well as those in Podlaskie (Ukr: Pidlashia) in southern Poland. From 1931-39, he ministered to the people of Volyn, Polisia, Pidliasia, and Belorussia. Bishop Charnetsky was invited by Irish Redemptorists to the 1932 Eucharistic Congress. He lodged for a fortnight in the guest-house of the Redemptoristine monastery on Saint Alphonsus Road and offered the Divine Liturgy in the monastery church each morning. On the second day of the Eucharistic Congress, Bishop Nicholas celebrated a Pontifical Divine Liturgy for all the Congress participants in the Jesuit Church on Gardiner Street; an icon-screen with hand-painted icons was especially made and installed for this purpose; it is not known what became of the screen. A choir directed by Paul Mailleux, S.J. (later Rector of the Pontifical Russian College in Rome) sang the Pontifical Liturgy in Church- Slavonic. Father (later Archbishop) Fulton J. Sheen of the United States was among the participating clergy. After the Eucharistic Congress, Bishop Nicholas remained in Ireland for several weeks, visiting various Redemptorist churches and schools. He then went back to Poland. Unfortunately, Bishop Nicholas never had an opportunity to return to Ireland; World War II and the Soviet persecution of the Church severely restricted his activity. Soviet invasion and imprisonment In 1939 Soviet armed forces invaded western Ukraine, causing the Redemptorists to flee to Lviv. Two years later, Bishop Mykolay took up a professorship at Lviv Theological Academy (now the Ukrainian Catholic University) which was revived in 1941. In 1944 the Soviets invaded for a second time and the following year all the Ukrainian Greek Catholic bishops were placed under arrest as part of the Soviet plan to suppress the Church and transfer its property to the state-sanctioned Russian Orthodox Church. During his time in prison Bishop Mykolay endured frequent violent interrogations. He was charged with collaborating with being an agent of a foreign power i.e. the Vatican; as a result he was sentenced to hard labour. Initially, one of his prison compatriots was the noted Cardinal Josyf Slipyj when both were imprisoned in Mariinsk, southern Siberia. Between his arrest in 1945 and his release eleven years later, Bishop Mykolay was moved around to about thirty a prisons. It was reported that, during all this time, he maintained a dignified, gentle and calming presence in spite of enduring over 600 hours of interrogation, which included torture. Release and death By 1956, the bishop‚Äôs health was in such a dismal state that a shroud had already been prepared; the prison authorities then decided to release him in order that he die elsewhere. However, he made enough of a surprising partial recovery that he was able to pastor the Ukrainian Catholic community, which was then operating clandestinely. Although he lived under constant surveillance, one of his most important acts was to secretly prepare and ordain young men called to the Priesthood. On 2 April 1959 Bishop Mykolay died and was buried in Lviv two days later. Due to many regarding him as a saint, people began visit his grave and to ask for his heavenly intercession immediately. Today people continue to claim that miracles happen through his intercession. On 23 April 2001 Bishop Charnetsky's martyrdom was verified by the assembly of Cardinals. He was beatified by Pope John Paul II during his pastoral visit to Ukraine on 27 June 2001. This date was significant as it is the feast of Our Lady of Perpetual Help, the patroness of the Redemptorists.

Andrew Leamy (1816, Killoskehane, near Drom, County Tipperary, Ireland - April 21, 1868 in Hull, Quebec) was a pioneer industrialist and community leader in Wright's Town, Lower Canada, which became Hull, Quebec and is now incorporated into the City of Gatineau in the National Capital Region of Canada. Andrew Leamy was the son of Michael Leamy and Margaret Marshall, who emigrated to Bytown with Andrew, his two brothers James and Michael and his two sisters Catherine and Anne in the 1820-1830 time frame. His Life The name Andrew Leamy is as commonly associated with the commercial and industrial development of the City of Hull as is the name of Philemon Wright. Like most of the other illustrious names of that pioneer era - names like Nicholas Sparks and J.R. Booth - Andrew Leamy began his business life as an employee of the Old Squire Wright, in 1830, living and working on Wright's Columbia Farm and learning his future trade as a lumber baron. Andrew also worked for Peter Aylen, taking his rafts to Quebec City. In 1833, his close ties with the Wright family - and Nicholas Sparks no doubt - led to his eventual marriage to Philemon Wright Jr.'s daughter, Erexina, who had become Nicholas Spark's adopted daughter after Wright Jr.'s death. In 1835, after a few years of frugality and good economy in Wright's employ, Leamy had saved enough to purchase 200 hectares of land from Philemon Wright - land that included Wright's original 'Gatteno Farm' (sic). In 1853, Leamy began his own enterprise as a lumberman by building a mill on the south shore of Columbia Pond, as it was first named, and the lake became known as Leamy Lake thereafter. Leamy dug a canal to connect the lake to the Gatineau River to facilitate the transportation of logs to his sawmill. The mill, which was the second steam-powered mill in the region - one of only two - was entirely destroyed when a boiler exploded, killing one of Leamy's sons. It was never rebuilt. Andrew Leamy was a devout Catholic and, in the tradition of the Wright family, gave much of his time to the social and cultural development of the small developing village of Wright's Town. According to the Drouin records of Notre-Dame Parish, he was a popular best man at weddings of his workers and godfather for many families. He worked hand-in-hand with P√®re Reboul to achieve the emancipation of school governance for the county. The result was the creation of the county's first independent School Commission in 1866, of which he was elected the first President. Leamy Lake, Leamy Road and the Leamy Farm Leamy's farm was the original 'Gatteno' Farm, the first farm Philemon Wright created when he arrived in the area in 1800. Leamy's farm contained several buildings of which one, right in front of his large home, was a stable for his prized race horses. The farm, located on the north side of Leamy's lake between the lake and the Gatineau River had a long road that led from the river all the way to the intersection of Columbia Road (now St. Joseph Blvd.) and Brigham's Road (now St. Raymond Blvd.). The road exists to this day even though a good part is blocked to traffic, but it now ends at Carri√®re Blvd. At some unknown time, when people no longer were living on it, the Leamy Road's name became listed by the city as Chemin du Lac-Leamy and then was changed, once again in 2010 to rue Atawe, despite many objections from citizens. The Leamy road was identified in all city directories up until the middle 1950s when the Leamy home itself was moved from its foundation to parts unknown in Hull. Today the lake, the park and the very popular Casino du Lac-Leamy still carry his name. The foundations of his home became buried over time and were the subject of an archaeological dig in 2006, commissioned by the National Capital Commission. What was found was a significant structure, quite remarkable in its construction because of the substantial width of the stone walls. A log building that was still standing in 1884 on Leamy's farm was probably the first home Philemon Wright built on the banks of the Gatineau River when he first arrived in the area in 1800. The Wright family called that home \\"The Wigwam\\".Wright Carr-Harris, Bertha: The White Chief of the Ottawa, page 28. William Briggs, Toronto 1903. It was the conclusion of another archeological dig at that site that the foundations of that house dated from the early 19th century. Leamy family oral history describes the Leamy home as occupying the spot where Philemon's home was situated, presumably Wright's 2nd home on the \\"Gatteno\\" Farm.The location was reburied for preservation and protection and the NCC has plans for future commemoration of the site.Archaeological Excavations and Collections on NCC Lands: . His Character From Andrew Leamy's obituary in the Citizen, April 1868: :\\"There were few men better known in Ottawa and the surrounding country in the sixties than Andrew Leamy of Gatineau Point, sawmill owner and lumberman. Mr. Leamy came of the pioneer family after whom Leamy's Lake, back of Hull, was named. Andrew Leamy was a large and powerful man and was noted for his strength and aggressiveness. He was essentially a man of the great outdoors. As a lumberman, his name was known far and wide. He had thousands of friends.\\" Anson A. Gard, author and historian, wrote this about Andrew Leamy: :\\"It is told of him, as showing his strength and endurance, that when repairs were needed for the mill, that he would mount a horse and carry the part ‚Äì often of heavy iron ‚Äì to Montreal, get it mended and without stopping to rest, would ride back to Hull, making a journey of 240 miles through a wild country, under the most tiring conditions.\\" :\\"I recently met an old resident of the Township, who remembered many of the pioneers. He was one of those rare beings who seemed to remember only the good qualities of the men he had known. \\"Another kind hearted man\\" said he \\"was Andy Leamy. I've known him to be driving along the road with a load of supplies for his lumber camp, and passing the hovel of a family in need, throw off a barrel of flour and pass on as though he thought nothing of it. Andy didn't make much pretense of being a saint, but he did a whole lot of good all the same.\\"Gard, Anson A.: Pioneers of the Upper Ottawa Valley and Humors of the Valley, section \\"Genealogy of the Valley\\" page 34. The Emerson Press, Ottawa 1906. John Lowrey Gourlay wrote: :\\"A man of fervor, (Reverend) Burwell, declared to his people from the pulpit, and in the parlor, shop and store, his newly-found views that struck most people with the force of all new ideas. His success in Hull seemed considerable, several influential people becoming obedient to the new faith. ‚Ä¶ Nevertheless the mob in Hull undertook to dictate to those who took up the new opinions, or at least to greatly disturb their meetings. ‚Ä¶ The late Andrew Leamy, a famous old warrior, took sometimes an active hand in these troubles. Often from sharp and angry words they went to blows, marking each others face's very picturesquely. ... Rev. Adam Hood Burwell eloquently and ably propagated these notions, and one or two Presbyterian families or heads of families were pleased with the views he advanced and for a time joined the party. Mr. Ruggles Wright opposed these views and refused his hall for their propagation. Mr. Alonzo Wright did not join them, but fiercely opposed the mobs, sometimes led by his uncle, Mr. Andrew Leamy who handled them roughly.\\"Gourlay, J.L.: History of the Ottawa Valley, pages 215 and 217. Publisher unknown 1896. In 1874, William Pittman Lett, Ottawa's first City Clerk, in his epic poem \\"Recollections of Bytown and Its Old Inhabitants\\" writes: :\\"And Andrew Leamy in his time. :Was head of many a stirring \\"shine;\\" :A man of mark he might be singled, :In whom the good and bad commingled, :In equal balance in such a way, :That each in turn had its sway. :He's gone! The grass grows o'er his head, :The Muse deals gently with the dead.\\"Lett, William Pittman: Recollections of Bytown and its Old Inhabitants, pages 55 and 56. Ottawa \\"Citizen\\" Printing and Publishing Company; Sparks Street, 1874. William Lett's poem makes reference to Leamy's participation in one event where Leamy participated in a brawl instigated by Peter Aylen in Bytown in 1837.Proceedings of Police Magistrates, Bytown, January 12 and 13, 1837, AO MacKenxie-Lindsey Papers, MU2366, cited in The Upper Ottawa Valley to 1855 by Richard M. Reid, pg. 59 In 1845, in an incident reported in both the Kingston Chronicle & Gazette (March 3) and then in the Bytown Gazette (May 16), it is reported that as a result of fight with Andrew Leamy over a paddle, a \\"fine, young Highlander\\" by the name of McCrae loses his life on February 23. More details are not given but there is no further report of charges laid over the matter. There is little doubt that Andrew Leamy learned to use his fists in his early days in the timber camps and like so many other fights involving lumbermen, the result could lead to tragedy.The Upper Ottawa Valley to 1855, Richard M. Reid, McGill-Queen's University Press, 1990, His Death On the dark & stormy night of April 21, 1868, one year after Canada was born, Andrew Leamy was last seen heading home on the old Leamy Road. But he never made it home alive. He was mortally injured in what appeared to be a nasty carriage accident. He was found the next morning, bleeding heavily from his head and with severely bruised ribs. To his family, and everyone else, it appeared that Leamy had suffered the same tragic fate that his late father-in-law, Philemon Wright Jr. had, when he also was thrown from his carriage when it overturned, and died some 47 years earlier. Leamy had a whole stable full of spirited racehorses and days after, it was said by a friend that Leamy had hitched up one of the most spirited among them, that very afternoon. Leamy did not linger long. He died that day. The family mourned & then, the community moved on. Only, it appears that long after anyone still wondered what happened that night, a \\"falling out\\" between a husband & his wife made the mystery about Leamy's death finally solved, 10 years later. In an article that first appeared in the Toronto Globe on August 15, 1878 and reprinted in the New York Times four days later, it was learned that a Henry Maxwell, a labourer who had been in Leamy's employ, and his unnamed brother-in-law were arrested for the murder and robbery of Andrew Leamy.The New York Times, August 15, 1878: . Leamy's murder occurred exactly two weeks to the day after the assassination of his good friend and fellow Irishman, Thomas D'Arcy McGee. Andrew Leamy's grandson, Andrew D'Arcy McReady, was named after his godfather, Thomas D'Arcy McGee. Andrew Leamy is buried in a piece of land that he had donated to the Church for the purpose of creating Notre Dame Cemetery in Gatineau, Quebec. His resting place can be found in a rear portion that overlooks the lake that today still bears his name. At his feet lie the remains of a young man named George Smyth. The stone that marks his grave is inscribed with the words: :Here :Lies the :Boddy of George Smyth :son to Thomas Smyth esq. of Eli :zabeth Town, DE of :Jonstown, Upr. Provence :dround at the three roks :upon the River Reado :6 May 1809 :Aged 20 years & 6 months(sic) Philemon Wright's lumbermen happened to be on the banks of the Ottawa River opposite the Rideau Falls, when the young man's body was found. He had the young man's remains buried in a beautiful, quiet corner of his property. Wright must have either known who he was or found out later. In any event, a stone was engraved with the above inscription. Today, we know that George Smyth was the youngest son of Lieutenant Thomas Smyth, esq, the man who gave his name to Smiths Falls on the Rideau River.Martin, Jean Carol Craig: \\"IN MEMORY OF CHELSEA'S HISTORIC CEMETERIES: COMMUNITY INSTITUTIONS FROM PIONEER TIMES TO THE PRESENT\\" Thesis submitted to the School of Graduate Studies and Research in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the M.

It is located approximately 6 miles from Athlone on the shores of Lough Ree. It comprises a square late medieval 4-storey stone tower with an attached 2-storey Georgian wing and Victorian tower. History Sir Henry de Leon, accompanied Prince John (later King John) of England to Ireland, after the initial invasion by the Earl of Pembroke (Strongbow) back in 1169, and was granted large areas of land in the Westmeath area. The Dillon family blazon has a red lion in the centre surrounded by three red shields. The surname eventually evolved from De-lee-on to Di-lee-on to Dillon. The Gaelic version of this surname is \\"Diolun\\". A branch of the Dillons were granted the lands of Portlick and probably constructed the medieval motte located nearby. This would have been their primary fortification and probable residence until the castle was constructed in the late medieval period. From then on they resided at the castle until 1696 when Garrett Dillon, former Recorder of Dublin, was attainted under the Articles of Limerick and forced to flee to France, where he died a few years later. It was then granted to Thomas Keightly, a member of King William's privy council, who in turn sold it to William Palmer of Dublin. Subsequently, the grant was repudiated and the property repossessed by the crown to be sold to the Reverend Robert Smyth (Smith) in 1703. A member of the Smyth family lived in Portlick Castle until 1955. The Smyths built the Georgian residential wing and in 1860 Robert Ralph Smyth then built a castellated 3-storey tower block at the front of the Georgian addition to give the building its current twin tower appearance. According to articles in The Westmeath Independent, Portlick Castle \\"was burned down on Wednesday, July 17, 1861\\", with loss of thousands of pounds worth of plates, furniture and books, and was uninhabitable when bought in 1988 by the Australian poet Luke Whitington, an art patron and an experienced restorer of derelict buildings in Italy.See ‚ÄúAussies Abroad, Luke Whitington‚Äù, by Alex McGregor, Sydney Morning Herald, 28 January 1989; plus ‚ÄúPortlick Castle to give a big boost to tourism‚Äù, article in The Westmeath Independent (date and author to be supplied).

College career Small attended University of South Carolina, where he hit 48 career home runs from 1972 through 1975 to set a USC record that stood for more than three decades until Justin Smoak hit 62 in 2008. In the nine-year period leading to his first season, USC hit 42 home runs. Small hit six more than that the next four years himself. In 1972 Small hit for a .379 batting average with four home runs as a freshman, then slumped to .282 with eight homers as a sophomore in 1973. After aluminium bats were allowed in 1974, he raised his average to .360 and belted a USC record 17 home runs in his junior season, garnering a second-team All-American selection. In April 1974, USC hosted an exhibition game at Sarge Frye Field between the New York Yankees and New York Mets. Prior to the game, a home run hitting contest included Thurman Munson of the Yankees, Duffy Dyer of the Mets and Small, who won with a decisive home run over the left field fence. Then, as a senior in 1975, Small batted .390 and broke his record with 19 home runs. Besides Small, the USC team featured future major league players as Garry Hancock, Greg Keatley, Ed Lynch and Jim Pankovits. USC finished second at the College World Series that year, and he earned first-team All-America honors. USC lost the championship game to University of Texas, 5‚Äì1, with Small‚Äôs homer accounting for the only run.

He is best known for the Myazedi inscription of 1113, which he donated in his father's honor. The stone inscription has scholarly significance because it allowed the deciphering of the Pyu language. Biography =Early life= Yazakumar was born to Thanbula and Kyansittha circa 1078 at Kyaungbyu. Kyansittha was a former general of the Pagan army who had been sent to exile by his father King Anawrahta for his affair with Anawrahta's young queen Manisanda. In 1077, Anawrahta died, and Kyansittha was recalled to the capital by Saw Lu to run the kingdom. Thanbula was pregnant with Yazakumar remained at Kyaungbyu. At Pagan, Kyansittha was sent into exile again‚Äîthis time to Dala (modern Yangon) for renewing his affair with Manisanda. In 1084, Kyansittha ascended to the Pagan throne but had forgotten about his wife and child at Kyaungbyu. When Thanbula found out that Kyansittha was king, she brought their son to Pagan, along with the ring that Kyansittha had given her as proof. The king was surprised to see them. Kyansittha had already word that his grandson Alaungsithu would be king because he thought he had no son. A remorseful Kyansittha made Yazakumar the titular head of north Arakan and seven hill districts.Harvey, pp. 39-40 =Myazedi inscription= Though passed over for the throne, Yazakumar never showed any disappointment. He spent his life with donating his inheritance for his mother's merit. He donated many temples in honor of his parents. He commissioned the Myazedi inscription as his father lay dying in bed. The inscription dated 1113 was written in four languages: Pyu, Burmese, Mon, and Pali, which all tell the story of Yazakumar and his father Kyansittha. The primary importance of the Myazedi inscription is that it allowed for the deciphering of the written Pyu.

It is endemic to Mexico and only known from its type locality near Candelaria Loxicha on the Sierra de Miahuatl√°n (part of Sierra Madre del Sur) in Oaxaca. Taxonomy It is similar to Sarcohyla cembra and Sarcohyla sabrina. Description The holotype, and the only known specimen, is a female that measured in snout‚Äìvent length. The coloration is distinctive: the dorsum is dark green, hidden surfaces are dark brown, flanks are yellow flanks, and canthal mask and lateral reticulations are dark brown. There is a yellow stripe that separates the dorsal from the ventral coloration on the limbs and above the cloaca. The fingers and toes are long and have large ovoid discs; webbing between the fingers is vestigial and slightly more developed between the toes. Habitat and conservation The species' habitat is mesic pine-oak forest; a single female frog was found in late afternoon, inactive between the leaves of an arboreal bromeliad at above sea level. Other amphibians found at the locality were salamanders Craugastor mexicanus and Bolitoglossa oaxacensis and frogs of the Exerodonta sumichrasti group. The area of type locality was covered with relatively intact forest at the time the holotype was collected in 2001. However, many slopes of the Sierra de Miahuatlan have been at least partially cleared for agriculture.

History Bara-Hack was settled in 1778 by Johnathan Randall Esq. and Obediah Higinbotham, two colonists of English ancestry. They and their families fled the Randall homestead and farm, situated on the coast of Cranston, Rhode Island, after the British advances of the Battle of Rhode Island of 1778 deemed it too dangerous for them to stay. They settled on land in Pomfret, Connecticut previously purchased by Randall in 1776, and there they built their homes, farms and livelihoods, including a water wheel powered mill, a business which produced spinning wheels for the production of textiles, and a small burial ground that would be shared by individual members of both families. Myths and legends have long been attached to not only the settlement itself, but its original inhabitants as well. Even the place names that it's generally referred to are questionable, as it never attained the size or scope of what could be defined of as a village (even hamlet might be a stretch), and Bara Hack, a Welsh term that is loosely translated as ‚Äúthe breaking of bread‚Äù, is likely to be that of 20th century manufacture, and has been primarily attributed to the writings of Odell Shepherd. The community was abandoned by 1890, possibly some time after the Civil War. Obediah Higinbotham was born in 1750 in Lancashire County, England. Today Bara-Hack is currently on private property. Alledgedly closed to the public after large numbers of Ghost hunters were tresspassing on the property. The forest has now overgrown the fields of Bara-Hack.

Given the disastrous form of the team, Claudio Bellucci's ten goals were impressive, while thought top scorer Igor Protti was one of the largest disappointments of the entire series. The lack of defensive skills cost Napoli many points, and more than two goals were conceded on average. This was despite Roberto Ayala's brilliance, which earned him a transfer to A.C. Milan.

Many of his earliest shots were characterised by a gritty, photojournalistic feel, such as Baader-Meinhoff 1969, featuring an elegantly dressed model carrying a submachine gun in place of a handbag, and Ossie Clark/Vietnam 1969, \\"in which a uniformed and helmeted GI has grabbed hold of a girl modelling a brilliantly dappled Ossie Clark outfit and looking like a Baroque saint in ecstasy.\\"Barry Schwabsky, \\"Jim Lee: Hamiltons Gallery\\", Artforum International, 1 May 2007 By the mid-seventies, much of Lee's work displayed a more romantic, soft-focus approach, similar to that of Sarah Moon and Deborah Turbeville, such as the hazy Selfridges/Bathers 1976 and the poignant Reflections 1975.George Hughes, \\"Jim Lee: Man with the light idea\\", Amateur Photographer, 23 March 1977, p.82. Often displaying a surreal aspect, his Austin Reed/Rome 1976 appears to show men diving out of a swimming pool, whilst Ossie Clark/Aeroplane 1969 has the model wearing a floaty Ossie Clark dress, flying towards her mirror image flanked by a pair of fighter aircraft. More interested in stories and girls than the clothes themselves, Lee's highly cinematic images suggested further intrigue. One fashion shoot, with models cajoling fighters in a boxing ring surrounded by seedy onlookers, was a result of Lee paying some regulars to stay there all night \\"to get the ring smoky and be there in the morning drunk\\".Wendy Toth, \\"Jim Lee\\", Photo District News, 1 September 2007.

Previously, he served as senior pastor of the First Baptist Church in Dallas, Texas, and in 2018 took the pastorate at Valleydale Church in Birmingham, Alabama. Career Brunson was born in the small town of Greenwood, South Carolina, the youngest of three children. He helped out in his father's retail furniture store and played football in high school. He became convinced of the truth of his religion at the age of 12 while at a summer camp run by the church. Brunson decided to become a minister during his freshman year at North Greenville College, where he completed his associate degree. He then obtained a B.A. at Furman University in Greenville. He studied at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary where he earned his Master of Divinity degree in 1985 and his Doctor of Ministry degree in 1991. Thereafter, he became pastor of South Norfolk Baptist Church in Chesapeake, Virginia, and then Green Street Baptist Church in High Point, North Carolina. In 1999 Brunson was appointed senior pastor of the historic First Baptist Church in Dallas, Texas. He was president of the Southern Baptist Convention Pastor's Conference in 2003. He moved to Jacksonville, Florida in February 2006 to replace retiring pastor Jerry Vines as senior pastor of First Baptist Church in Jacksonville. At that time the Jacksonville church had 28,000 members and occupied eleven blocks of downtown. On May 6, 2018, Brunson preached his last sermon as senior pastor of First Baptist Church Jacksonville.https://www.news4jax.com/community/mac-brunson- resigns-as-senior-pastor-of-first-baptist-church On July 22, 2018 Brunson started preaching at another Southern Baptist church, Valleydale Church in Birmingham, Alabama. Activities In 2006 Brunson joined Jacksonville Mayor John Peyton, Congressman Ander Crenshaw and Senator Bill Nelson in a Memorial Day ceremony. On Jacksonville's 2007 Day of Faith in September 2007 he called on anyone who wanted to pray for solidarity against crime. The previous year the event had been sponsored by the city, but this time it was purely arranged by the churches. In April 2009 a police detective who is also a member of Brunson's security detail investigated the website of a blogger critical of Brunson's $300,000 salary and other perks. Discussing the accusations, Brunson said he was one of the lowest-paid mega-church pastors in the Southern Baptist Convention. The anonymous blogger's name was revealed to the church, and a trespass warning was issued that banned the longtime member and his wife from First Baptist. The blogger later filed a lawsuit against First Baptist and Brunson, claiming they committed fraud and misrepresented events, and that the pastor made malicious and false statements. In April 2012 the defamation lawsuit was settled under confidential terms. Brunson made a public apology for his statements, in which he had called the blogger \\"obsessive compulsive\\" and a \\"sociopath\\". Brunson is a supporter of the Institute for Creation Research (ICR). At the 2009 annual Pastors Conference held at First Baptist Church, Jacksonville, the ICR gave away some 6,000 books and magazines promoting creationism and criticizing belief in evolution. In May 2010 Brunson called on Southern Baptist pastors to follow the Great Commission in proclaiming the gospel everywhere they go in order to stem the considerable decline in church membership. Brunson is the founder of Inlight Ministries, which broadcasts his message around the country. Inlight also provides podcasts via iTunes. =Ordinance 2012-296= In 2012, Brunson was a vocal opponent of Ordinance 2012-296, a bill that if passed would have added sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression to the City of Jacksonville's Human Rights Commission. Adding this wording would have established protections for those stated groups in the areas of employment, housing, and public accommodations. In an August 7, 2012 opinion piece in the Florida Times-Union, Brunson wrote, \\"With the left hand, City Council wants us to believe it is concerned with the rights of the church. Yet with the right hand, council reveals its true intention ‚Äî requiring Christians to subordinate their faith to the dictates of government steered by a rabid minority\\". On an August 15 vote, the original and altered form of the bill failed to pass the city council. City council members that voted down the bill were later honored at a First Baptist Church service, Brunson as the presiding pastor.

This phenomenon has resulted in the accumulation of unprecedented amounts of public data. This large and frequently updated data source has been described as a new type of scientific instrument for the social sciences. Several independent researchers have used social data to \\"nowcast\\" and forecast trends such as unemployment, flu outbreaks, mood of whole populations, travel spending and political opinions in a way that is faster, more accurate and cheaper than standard government reports or Gallup polls. Social data refers to data individuals create that is knowingly and voluntarily shared by them. Cost and overhead previously rendered this semi-public form of communication unfeasible, but advances in social networking technology from 2004‚Äì2010 has made broader concepts of sharing possible. The types of data users are sharing include geolocation, medical data, dating preferences, open thoughts, interesting news articles, etc. The social data revolution enables not only new business models like the ones on Amazon.com but also provides large opportunities to improve decision-making for public policy and international development. The analysis of large amounts of social data leads to the field of computational social science. Classic examples include the study of media contentDetecting macropatterns in global media content or social media content.Twitter Mood: The Effects of the Recession on Public Mood in the UK Evolution of social data Every internet activity leaves behind traces of data (a digital footprint) which can be used to learn more about the user. As use of the internet is becoming more widespread, the datafication of the world is progressing rapidly: Currently, around 16 zettabytes of data are produced per year and for the year 2025 163 zettabytes of data are expected. This has led to data becoming a critical commodity. This ties together all societal actors: Public institutions, private firms, as well as individuals, each relying on data in a unique way. Governments have been collecting data for centuries to ensure the continuance of institutional systems, through limiting the risk of defaulting credits, collecting tax based on income and providing the necessary infrastructure under consideration of their citizens' demographic distribution. In its beginnings, this data entailed written information for record keeping and control, including a census system. This analogue process was very time- and cost-intensive, leaving little room for interpreting larger data sets. Meanwhile, corporate technological developments have moved this offline data into the digital age, allowing visualization and data analytics. In the public sphere, connecting the survey and poll methodologies with database computing, resulted in the ability to gather and store large data sets on individuals.  Web 2.0 and social network sites  Over the last few decades, the internet has shifted from being used mostly as a source of information about the world to being primarily used for communication, user-generated content, data sharing, and community building.Fuchs, Christian. 2011. \\"Web 2.0, Prosumption, and Surveillance.\\" Surveillance & Society 8(3): 288-309. This is what many consider to be the development of \\"Web 2.0\\" social network sites such as Facebook and YouTube are the foundation of the development of Web 2.0 and the shift to social data sharing. Early examples of social data websites are Craigslist and the wishlists of Amazon.com. Both enable users to communicate information to anybody who is looking for it. They differ in their approach to identity. Craigslist leverages the power of anonymity, while Amazon.com leverages the power of persistent identity, based on the history of the customer with the firm. The job market is even being shaped by the information people share about themselves on sites like LinkedIn and Facebook. Examples of more sophisticated social data sites are Twitter and Facebook. On Twitter, sending a message or tweet is as simple as sending an SMS text message. Twitter made this C2W, customer to the world: Any tweet a user sends can potentially be read by the entire world. Facebook focuses on interactions between friends, C2C in traditional language. It provides many ways for collecting data from its users: \\"tag\\" a friend in a photo, \\"comment\\" on what they posted, or just \\"like\\" it. These data are the basis for sophisticated models of the relationships between users. They can be used to significantly increase the relevance of what is shown to the user, and for advertising purposes. By 2009, the popularity of social networking sites had increased to four times of what it had been in 2005.Donde, Deepa S., Chopade, Neha, and Ranjith, P.V. 2012. \\"Social networking sites: a new era of 21st century.\\" SIES Journal of Management 8(1): 66-73. As of 2013, Twitter has over 250 million users sharing almost 500 million tweets per day, and Facebook has well over one billion users around the world.Osatuyi, Babajide. 2013. \\"Information sharing on social media sites.\\" Computers in Human Behavior 29(6): 2622-2631.  Business sector and social data  Companies often use the data that is shared via social networking sites and other forms of data sharing avenues, advertisers, etc.Jai, Tun-Min, and King, Nancy J. 2016. \\"Privacy versus reward: Do loyalty programs increase consumers' willingness to share personal information with third-party advertisers and data brokers?\\" Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services 28: 296-303. Social networking sites, for example, can sell user data to advertisers and other entities which they can then influence consumer decisions. Data mining is also used to gather this information. While websites and other applications were the origins of this data collection, with improvements in technology, many devices that are used in daily life have the ability to collect data on individuals and therefore are increasing the amount of personal data that is available (ex. smartphones, tech watches, music devices, etc.).Morey, Timothy, Forbath, Theodore, and Schoop, Allison. 2015. \\"Customer data: designing for transparency and trust.\\" Harvard Business Review 93(5): 96-105 This growth of people's digital identity ‚Äì the information available via these electronic sources- is being used by companies and organizations to improve products and services and to reduce costs by targeting what consumers want/expect. The data that can be gathered can include shopping experiences, social media preferences, demographic information and more. Using this data can allow for better personalization of products and has become an expected and vital aspect of product use and production. The data that is accessible about consumers can be used to infer behavioral patterns of consumers.Smith, Natasha. 2015. \\"The datafication of marketing.\\" DM News: 16+. Retrieved from http://go.galegroup.com/ For example, location information is used to assess when and where consumers are going to target ads and promotions based on what stores consumers are going to. Online retailers also have gained insight as to how better personalize the online shopping experience through data gathered during the online transaction. Businesses can even use consumer data to determine whether different shelf spacing of products has an effect on consumer purchasing decisions as well as assess potential cross-item marketing potentials based on items often purchased together. = Social commerce = While businesses and advertisers often take advantage of the consumer data available, consumers also use other users' information for their purchase decisions. Social commerce sites are where consumers share product/service experiences and opinions and other information.Liu, Libo, Cheung, Christy M.K., and Lee, Matthew K.O. 2016. \\"An empirical investigation of information sharing behavior on social commerce sites.\\" International Journal of Information Management 36(5): 686-699. A famous example of such a site is Pinterest which has over 100 million users. These sites and other online sources of product/brand information are influential on consumer's purchasing decisions.Chen, Jie, Teng, Lefa, Yu, Ying, and Yu, Xeer. 2016. \\"The effect of online information sources on purchase intentions between consumers with high and low susceptibility to informational influence.\\" Journal of Business Research 69(2): 467-475. It is estimated that about 67% of online customers use this information in making their purchase decisions. These sites create an environment that is considered trusted by consumers since the information is coming from other consumers.  Other uses of social data  With the vast amount of data available about individuals that are accessible, the potential uses of this information are growing. The healthcare sector has many potential uses for this data. Information gathered from social media, and other social data sharing sources can be used to predict the flu, disease outbreaks, how emergency responses are handled, and more.Nguyen, Duc T., and Jung, Jai E. 2016. \\"Real-time event detection for online behavioral analysis of big social data.\\" Future Generation Computer Systems 66: 137-145. With the use of Twitter and geotags, medical researchers can evaluate the health of a particular neighborhood and use that information to provide better outreach and services. Medtronic has developed a digital blood glucose meter that allows health care providers and patients know about low levels. Social data can also be used to assess reactions to crises.Spence, Patric R., Lachlan, Kenneth A., and Rainear, Adam M. 2016. \\"Social media and crisis research: Data collection and directions.\\" Computers in Human Behavior 54: 667-672. After Hurricane Sandy, researchers used Twitter to evaluate the emotions and issues that those affected were facing. This information can potentially be used to help better prepare and respond to future crises. This data can be used to assist with urban planning. The city of Boston has used rider information from Uber to improve transportation planning and road maintenance. = Computational social science = Using social data for research purposes has led to the development of computational social science. Computational social science combines social science, computer science, and network science.Chang, R. M., Kauffman, R.J., and Kwon, Y. 2014. Understanding the paradigm shift to computational social science in the presence of big data. Decision, 63, 67-80. This field emerged in 2009.Mann, A. 2016. Core concept: computational social science. PNAS, 113(3). 468-470. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1524881113 Before the rise of social data and the technological advances that supported it, researchers were limited to a narrow view of information based on individuals since their primary form of research relied on interviews. With the vast amount of social data available today, researchers can now analyze a wider group and can obtain a broader view of information. They can use social networks, cell phone data, and perform online experiments that allow them to gather more information than before.  Privacy concerns  With the amount of data available about individuals accessible by many sources, privacy has become a major concern. Security breaches of customer and other social information such as the compromise of more than 56 million Home Depot customers' credit card information have impacted the concern of privacy with social data. How companies are using, and the potential misuse of the personal information gathered is a concern for the majority of consumers. Despite this, many people do not know how social networking sites and other sources are using and selling their data.Lilley, Stephen, Frances S. Grodzinsky and Andra Gumbus. 2012. \\"Revealing the Commercialized and Compliant Facebook User.\\" Journal of Information, Communication & Ethics in Society 10(2):82-92 In 2014 study, only 25% of online users knew that their location could be accessed and only 14% knew that their web-surfing history could be accessed and shared. Even though privacy concern is a critical factor in people's sharing of personal information on the internet and overall internet involvement, most people are willing to share this information if the benefits of doing so outweigh the potential privacy and security costs. Consumers enjoy the personalization of products and services that are possible because of this information gathering and despite the concerns, continue to use them. International development In his study of the data revolution in international development, Martin Hilbert argued that the natural next step from information societies, fueled by ICT, since the late 1990s are knowledge societies informed by Big Data analysis. Decision-making informed by big data analysis has improved both efficiency and productivity in the developed world. Hilbert examines the challenges and potential of the data revolution on \\"the unruly world of international development.\\" Types of data Hilbert identified four types of data available in large quantities by 2013: words, locations, nature, and behavior. =Words= Individual interactions with the internet, such as words in comments, social media postings, and Google search term volumes, offer an increasingly large source of big data. Typically statistics are generated through a census or a probability survey, for example, the Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC), Current Population Survey (CPS), American Community Survey (ACS), National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) in the United States or administrative records, such as payroll, unemployment, Social Security income taxes, scanner data and credit card data and other commercial transaction records. Weatherhead University Professor Gary King described how the revolution is not just regarding the quantity of data available but in the ability to do something with the data to benefit society. =Location= Global Positioning System (GPS)-enabled mobile tablets, phones, Radio- frequency identification (RFID) chips (part of Automatic identification and data capture (AIDC) technologies), telematics, Location-based games, etc. provide data on absolute location and relative movement. =Nature= Hilbert categorizes data on natural processes under 'Nature' which includes sensors that provide data on moisture in the air and temperature. =Behavior= Data can be generated from user-behavior in multiplayer online games, such as League of Legends, World of Warcraft, Minecraft, Call of Duty, and Dota 2.

History The centre was established in 2007. In 2010, OPHI developed the Multidimensional Poverty Index for the United Nations Development Programme's Human Development Report. Since then OPHI has published a Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) annually. OPHI also serves as the Secretariat of the Multidimensional Poverty Peer Network (MPPN), a South-South initiative that supports policymakers to develop multidimensional poverty measures. It promotes the use of such measures for more effective poverty eradication efforts at the global, national and local levels. About OPHI aims to build and advance a more systematic methodological and economic framework for reducing multidimensional poverty, grounded in people‚Äôs experiences and values. OPHI works towards this by: * Broadening poverty measurement. OPHI develops and implements multi-dimensional measures of poverty, wellbeing and inequality. These measures go beyond traditional one- dimensional approaches to incorporate dimensions such as health, education, living standards, quality of work and more innovative dimensions. * Improving data on poverty. OPHI has developed tools to measure five missing dimensions of poverty data that poor people value but which have been largely overlooked in international studies of poverty to date: Quality of Work, Empowerment, Physical Safety, The Ability to go About Without Shame and Psychological Wellbeing. * Building capacity. OPHI runs academic courses and technical training programmes on multidimensional poverty and human development, and collaborates with universities, development agencies, governments and other research institutions and policy makers using our work. * Impacting policy. OPHI‚Äôs methodologies have been adopted by policy makers, including national governments and the United Nations Development Programme Human Development Report. OPHI‚Äôs work is grounded in Amartya Sen‚Äôs capability approach. OPHI works to implement this approach by creating real tools that inform policies to reduce poverty. OPHI‚Äôs team members are involved in a wide range of activities and collaborations around the world, including survey design and testing, quantitative and qualitative data collection, training and mentoring, and advising policy makers. Missing Dimensions of Poverty Money alone is an incomplete measure of ‚Äòpoverty‚Äô. Human development is more about giving people the opportunities to live lives they value, and enable them to achieve their own destiny. This goes beyond material resources ‚Äì as people value many other aspects of life ‚Äì and also focuses on what people are able to be and to do. OPHI has identified five ‚ÄòMissing Dimensions‚Äô of poverty that deprived people cite as important in their experiences of poverty. To call attention to these ‚Äòmissing dimensions‚Äô, and to use them as a guide to policy, better data are needed. Objective OPHI promotes collection and analysis of data on five ‚Äòmissing dimensions‚Äô of poverty: * Quality of work * Empowerment * Physical safety * Social connectedness * Psychological wellbeing To date, these dimensions have been largely overlooked in large-scale quantitative work on poverty and human development. OPHI has designed five short, 8-10 minute questionnaire modules that can be integrated into national household surveys to obtain these data. Criteria The following criteria were used to identify suitable indicators for inclusion in individual or household surveys. * The indicators need to be internationally comparable. * They should assess both the instrumental and the intrinsic aspects of each dimension. * They must enable identification of changes in the missing dimensions over time. * They should draw on previous experience of particular indicators; notably we tried to use indicators that had been previously fielded and found to be ‚Äòadequate‚Äô measures for research purposes. Progress to date OPHI has ongoing collaboration with teams around the world to test and improve the modules and to produce new data and qualitative and quantitative analyses on the missing dimensions. Currently, OPHI and partners are fielding a nationally representative survey in Chad, and the first nationally representative dataset and analyses were conducted in Chile. Projects have also be conducted in Philippines, Nigeria and Sri Lanka, plus a first smaller project in Chad. You can read about OPHI's projects on the Missing Dimensions here. Multidimensional Poverty Most countries of the world define poverty by income. Yet poor people themselves define their poverty much more broadly, to include lack of education, health, housing, empowerment, humiliation, employment, personal security and more. No one indicator, such as income, is uniquely able to capture the multiple aspects that contribute to poverty. Multidimensional poverty encompasses a range of deprivations that a household may suffer. The number of indicators and specific indicators used depend on the purpose of the measure. Common purposes include national poverty measures that reflect changes over time, targeting of services or conditional cash transfers and monitoring and evaluation. At a glance, multidimensional measures present an integrated view of the situation. We can also examine poverty by population group, or study the composition of deprivation for different groups. Multidimensional metrics are rigorous, easy to use, flexible, and adaptable to different contexts. OPHI has developed a methodology for measuring multidimensional poverty known as the Alkire Foster (AF) method. OPHI researchers apply the AF method and related multidimensional measures to a range of different countries and contexts. Their analyses span a number of different topics, such as changes in multidimensional poverty over time, comparisons in rural and urban poverty, and inequality among the poor. For more information on OPHI‚Äôs research, see their working paper series and research briefs. Alkire Foster Method Sabina Alkire and James Foster created a new method for measuring multidimensional poverty. It includes identifying ‚Äòwho is poor‚Äô by considering the range of deprivations they suffer, and aggregating that information to reflect societal poverty in a way that is robust and decomposable. Contemporary methods of measuring poverty and wellbeing commonly generate a statistic for the percentage of the population who are poor, a head count (H). The Alkire Foster Method generates a headcount and also a unique class of poverty measures (MŒ±): M0: An ‚Äòadjusted head count‚Äô. This reflects both the incidence (the percentage of the population who are poor) and intensity of poverty (the number of deprivations suffered by each household, A). It is calculated by multiplying the proportion of people who are poor by the percentage of dimensions in which they are deprived (M0 = H x A). M1: This measure reflects the incidence, intensity and depth of poverty. The depth of poverty is the ‚Äògap‚Äô (G) between poverty and the poverty line (M1 = H x A x G). M2: This measures reflects the incidence, intensity, depth of poverty and inequality among the poor (the squared gap, S) (M2 = H x A x S). M0 can be calculated with ordinal and cardinal data. Cardinal data are required to calculate M1 and M2. The Alkire Foster Method is unique in that it can distinguish between, for example, a group of poor people who suffer only one deprivation on average and a group of poor people who suffer three deprivations on average at the same time. This flexible approach can be employed in a variety of situations by choosing different dimensions (e.g. education), indicators (e.g. how many years of education a person has) and cutoffs (e.g. a person with fewer than five years of education is considered deprived). Common Uses of the Alkire Foster Method * Poverty measures. The Alkire Foster method can be used to create national, regional or international measures of poverty or wellbeing by incorporating dimensions and indicators that are tailored to the specific context. * Targeting of services or conditional cash transfers. The Alkire Foster method can be used to target people who meet multiple criteria. * Monitoring and evaluation. The Alkire Foster method can be used to monitor the effectiveness of programmes over time. Why the Alkire Foster Method is Useful The Alkire Foster method is a single societal poverty measure, but it can be broken down and analysed in a powerful way to inform policy. It can be used to: * Break down by population group. the measure can be broken down (decomposed) by geographic area, ethnicity, or other groups, to show the composition of poverty within and among the groups. * Break down by dimension/indicator. the measure can be broken down (decomposed) after identification to show which deprivations are driving poverty among and within groups. * Compare across time. the measure can be used to monitor changes in poverty and the composition of poverty over time using time series or panel data. The Alkire Foster method reflects other dimensions directly and changes immediately as these change. This makes it an effective monitoring tool because improvements in the dimensions measured, such as health and education, are reflected quickly. * Target the poorest groups and beneficiaries of conditional cash transfers, district interventions or public programmes. The targeting tool can be broken down to show the indicators in which they are most deprived. * Complement other metrics. The Alkire Foster Method can complement other measures, such as income poverty.

She spent 24 years on the Upper Clyde crossings. During her final years with Calmac, she relieved in the west highlands. History MV Bute was the last of a trio of vehicle vessels ordered in 1951 to modernise the Clyde fleet. Three \\"general purpose\\" vessels were planned for the Clyde routes of their names, , MV Bute and . Built by Ailsa Shipbuilding Company, she was launched from their Troon yard on 28 September 1954. After 24 years' service, she was laid up in Greenock's James Watt Dock in late 1978 and was still there the following spring. In November 1979, she was sold to Gerasinos Phetouris of Greece. As Med Sun, registered in Piraeus, she left the Clyde, on 17 June 1980, under tow, for the Adriatic. Phetouris died in 1983 and his vision for her and was never progressed. The former Clyde ferry was broken up in 1984-85. Layout MV Butes passenger accommodation consisted of a large lounge and a tearoom above, and a bar below, the car deck. The bridge was above the upper deck, allowing passengers unobstructed views forward. Officer and crew accommodation was below the bridge and at the stern. She was fitted with electric hoists and side-ramps to allow the loading of vehicles from conventional piers and at any state of tide. The 14-ton cargo lift had space for five average cars, which were turned on two 14-foot turntables on the lift and a further one at the front of the \\"garage\\". An aft cargo hold had two 7-ton derricks for cargo handling. These were removed in 1958 and the hold plated over, to provide additional car deck area. In 1975 Butes lift-supports were extended to allow her hoist to be raised an additional four feet for service at Mallaig. For her final service, a door was cut in her side ramp, allowing access to flit boats on the Small Isles run. Service MV Bute entered service on the Rothesay service in 1954. She remained in the upper Clyde for much of her career, initially on the service for which she was named. From 1957 the three \\"A, B, C\\" sisters were working interchangeably. By 1972, linkspans at Gourock and Dunoon, and the use former Skye ferries on the Cumbrae crossing, restricted Bute and Cowal to the Wemyss Bay to Rothesay crossing. From December 1972 Bute was chartered to MacBrayne's for two months on the Oban - Craignure - Lochaline run, while was rebuilt as a drive-through ferry. By the time she returned to the Clyde, the two fleets had combined under one management on 1 January 1973. Butes funnel carried the new red CalMac colour, while that of Cowal remained the vivid CSP yellow until 1974. Bute returned to Mull in 1973. In early 1975, Bute operated the Ardyne contract, transporting workers to the oil rig construction site. For four summers from 1975 she maintained the Armadale crossing. Winters saw her back on the Clyde, but the arrival of the new made Bute (and ) redundant. , and were all available for relief. Bute gave her last passenger sailing to the Small Isles, on 21 October 1978.

The inscription contains information about hydraulic projects; the irrigation and water drainage project of the Chandrabhaga river by the order of Rajadirajaguru, and also the water project of the Gomati river by the order of King Purnawarman in the 22nd year of his reign. The digging project to straighten and widen the river was conducted in order to avoid flooding in the wet season, and as an irrigation project during the dry season. In 1911 by the initiative of P. de Roo de la Faille, the Tugu inscription was moved to Museum Bataviaasch genootschap van Kunsten en Wetenschappen (now National Museum of Indonesia) with inventory number D.124. The inscription was carved on a round egg-like stone measuring about 1 metre.  Content  The Tugu inscription was written in Pallava script, which is the pre-Tamil script, arranged in the form of Sanskrit Sloka with Anustubh metrum, consisting of five lines that run around the surface of the stone. Just like other inscriptions from the Tarumanagara kingdom, the Tugu inscriptions do not mention the date of the edict. The date of the inscriptions was estimated and analyzed according to paleographic study which concluded that the inscriptions originated from the mid 5th century. The script of the Tugu inscription and the Cidanghyang inscription bear striking similarity, such as the script \\"citralaikha\\" written as \\"citralekha\\", leading to the assumption that the writer of these inscriptions was the same person. The Tugu inscription is the longest Tarumanagara inscription pronounced by edict of Sri Maharaja Purnawarman. The inscription was made during the 22nd year of his reign, to commemorate the completion of the canals of the Gomati and Candrabhaga rivers. On the inscription there is an image of a staff crowned with Trisula straight to mark the separation between the beginning and the end of each sentence. = Original script = pura rajadhirajena guruna pinabahuna khata khyatam purim prapya candrabhagarnnavam yayau// pravarddhamane dvavingsad vatsare sri gunau jasa narendradhvajabhutena srimata purnavarmmana// prarabhya phalguna mase khata krsnastami tithau caitra sukla trayodasyam dinais siddhaikavingsakaih ayata satsahasrena dhanusamsasatena ca dvavingsena nadi ramya gomati nirmalodaka// pitamahasya rajarser vvidaryya sibiravanim brahmanair ggo sahasrena prayati krtadaksina// = English translation = \\"Long ago, the river named Candrabhaga had been dug by a noble Maharaja that have strong and tight arms, Purnawarman, to channel (water) flow to the sea, after the canal flow by his famous royal palace.

UPnP AV clients :See also Digital Living Network Alliance#DLNA- certified software. A UPnP client, also called a control point, functions as a digital audio/video remote control. Control points automatically detect UPnP servers on the network to browse content directories and request the transfer or streaming of media. A UPnP media renderer performs the actual audio or video rendering. Control points and media renderers most commonly run on separate devices, the control point being for example a tablet, and the renderer a television or a networked audio computer connected to an audio receiver. Some control points integrate a media renderer and may function as a complete music playing application. =UPnP control points and player software= Cross-platform * Audionet RCP is an UPnP control point available for Windows and macOS * Banshee, an open source (MIT) media player with UPnP-client support since version 2.4 * Kinsky is an open source UPnP control point for iPod/iPhone, iPad, Windows, macOS, Linux, Android and PocketPC. * Kodi (XBMC#XBMCbuntuXBMC), a cross platform open source software media-player/media center for Apple TV, Linux, macOS, Windows, Android and the custom XBMC#XBMCbuntu. * Neutron Music Player, a cross platform UPnP/DLNA client which is able to read music files from UPnP/DLNA Media Server or send processed audio to UPnP/DLNA Media Renderer as an endless stream.

The movie follows a group of 10 schoolchildren and their two inspirational teachers as they struggle with poverty and develop hopes for the future in Gantong Village on the farming and tin mining island of Belitung off the east coast of Sumatra. The film is one of the highest grossing in Indonesian box office history Local Movie to Open Jakarta Film Festival The Jakarta Globe, Lisa Siregar, June 22, 2009 and won a number of local and international awards. Synopsis The movie, set in the 1970s, opens on the first day of the year at a Muhammadiyah elementary school on Belitung. The school needs 10 students but is one short until near the end of the day, when a straggler fills out the ranks for their teachers, Muslimah and Harfan. Muslimah dubs the children \\"The Rainbow Troops\\" (sometimes translated as \\"The Rainbow Warriors\\") and the movie traces their development and relationships with the teachers. Background and impact The film reportedly cost 8 billion rupiah (US$890,000; ~ US$1,000,000 in 2017 accounting for inflation) to make and was a year in production. Most of the child actors in the film are from Belitung, and Producer Mira Lesmana explained that choice by saying: \\"In my opinion, there won't be any actors with a deeper connection to the roles than those who were born and lived in Belitong their entire life.\\" Laskar Pelangi: The Audacity of Hope The Jakarta Post, Iwan Seti, September 7, 2008 The Bangka Belitung Provincial government declared some of the locations used in the film as areas of importance to culture and tourism in 2010, and provincial tourism chief Yan Megawandi said the decision was \\"primarily\\" made to help raise funds for the Muhammadiyah elementary school on which the film and novel's story are centered. Lokasi Pengambilan Gambar Laskar Pelangi Dilestarikan Republika newspaper, June 25, 2010 The film's local and international success fueled a tourism boom on Belitung, with Indonesian airline Garuda reopening direct service from Jakarta to Tanjung Pandan, Belitung's capital.

It was an IWW meeting hall, where Tom Mooney once attempted to organize railway workers.Curt Gentry, Frame-up; the incredible case of Tom Mooney and Warren Billings. Norton 1967Crocker Langley City Directory 1920 Later, it was home to artists and musicians from at least the early sixties through 2002. Notable residents included Terry Riley, The Cockettes, Lise Swenson of Artists' Television Access, and two of the artists - Rigo 23 and Aaron Noble, who were founding members of the Clarion Alley Mural Project. 47 Clarion was demolished in 2001, and a parking lot for the condominium project on 17th Street replaced it. It became a symbol of the neighborhood's gentrification.  Murals  Since 1992, the alley has been covered in murals painted by the Clarion Alley Mural Project. Alley residents Noble and Rigo together painted the mural \\"Superhero Warehouse\\" showing a series of depressed superheroes on the warehouse's side, as a contribution to the mural project. Another of the early murals, painted by Scott Williams after research done by Fred Rinne, depicted native animals of the Mission District. \\"Dog Days\\" Clarion Alley was featured in the opening chapter of the fiction novel \\"Dog Days\\" by John Levitt. The main character is ambushed by evil forces that animate one of the murals into a monstrous force.

Later the band included a live guitarist Stephen Leacock, who went on to play drums in General Fiasco with Owen Strathern. The group disbanded in 2007 due to work commitments and General Fiasco becoming more serious. History The Tides formed in 2002. The 4 members went to the same school (Rainey) in Magherafelt in Northern Ireland. In 2004, The Tides ep was recorded at Manor Park studios with Neal Caulderwood. In 2005, this was followed up with the 'On Our Way' ep. In 2006, they entered BBC's ATL Rock School and won. The band featured on the TV show alongside Emma Willis as one of the judges. Following this, the band recorded new songs at the famous Windmill Lane studio in Dublin and a studio in Belfast. In late 2006, these songs along with some tracks from the previous 2 ep's was released as the album 'One For The Man Over There'. The album received critical acclaim by the music press including Hotpress, Daily Mirror and BBC ATL saying 'if Oasis could write the likes of All Good for Me, there would be a day of national celebration'. The band would play regularly in Magherafelt's rock bar Bryson's as well as other venues throughout Northern Ireland. IMRO showcases in Dublin and the Y Not Festival were played at in the UK & Ireland as the band were featured on BBC's ATL tv shows, BBC Radio 1, RTE 2FM and other regional radio stations. They also supported the likes of Kaiser Chiefs,The Raconteurs, Starsailor, The View, ASIWYFA, Duke Special.

Officially MD 808A and known as Main Street, the state highway runs from Ridgeville Boulevard north to MD 27 within Mount Airy. MD 808 follows the Carroll-Frederick county line for a portion of its length near its southern terminus. The county line portion is considered to be in Carroll County for maintenance purposes. MD 808 is the old alignment of MD 27 through Mount Airy. A portion of Main Street was paved by 1910; the sections south and north of the town center were constructed in the early 1910s and late 1910s, respectively. MD 808 was assigned to Main Street after MD 27's bypass of Mount Airy was completed in the mid-1970s. Route description View north along MD 808 in Mount Airy MD 808 begins at an intersection with Ridgeville Boulevard, the original route of U.S. Route 40 (US 40), in the Ridgeville section of Mount Airy. Main Street continues south as a municipal street to an intersection with MD 27 just north of that highway's interchange with Interstate 70 and US 40 (Baltimore National Pike). MD 808 heads north through residential subdivisions as a two-lane undivided road following the Carroll- Frederick county line on top of a ridge. South of Sunset Avenue, the state highway fully enters Carroll County. MD 808 continues north through the Mount Airy Historic District, where the highway crosses paths with the former right- of-way of the Mount Airy Loop of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. The state highway passes Buffalo Road, which forms the Carroll-Frederick county line for several miles, and Waterville Road before leaving the town limits. MD 808 passes through the hamlet of Dorceytown before reaching its northern terminus at an intersection with MD 27 (Ridge Road). History The unincorporated community of Ridgeville and the town of Mount Airy developed on top of Parr's Ridge, a north-south ridge that separates the Monocacy River watershed and Frederick County to the west from the Patapsco River watershed and Carroll County to the east. The ridge was originally crossed by the Baltimore and Fredericktown Turnpike at Ridgeville and the B&O; Railroad at Mount Airy. By 1910, a paved road connected the turnpike and the Mount Airy Loop of the railroad. The ridge-top road north from Mount Airy and south toward Montgomery County was designated for improvement as one of the original state roads by the Maryland State Roads Commission in 1909. The state road was paved as a wide macadam road from the turnpike in Ridgeville south to the Howard County line in 1913. The highway from the center of Mount Airy north through Dorceytown was completed as a wide concrete road in 1920. MD 27 from its southern terminus in Germantown north to Westminster was originally designated MD 29 when the first state-numbered routes were established in Maryland in 1927. In 1934, US 29 was extended into Maryland over what had previously been MD 27 between Silver Spring and Ellicott City; the Germantown-Westminster and Silver Spring - Ellicott City highways swapped numbers. MD 27's interchange with I-70 was constructed when US 40 was relocated as a four-lane divided highway through Ridgeville in 1953 and 1954. MD 27's bypass of Mount Airy was constructed from Dorceytown south to Ridgeville Boulevard in 1972. The I-70 interchange was reconstructed as part of I-70's upgrade to Interstate standards in 1975. The bypass was completed from Ridgeville Boulevard south to the I-70 interchange in 1977; MD 808 was marked on Main Street by 1978. Junction list The entire route of MD 808A is in Mount Airy. The state highway follows the Carroll-Frederick county line between its southern terminus and a point south of Sunset Avenue. The county line portion is considered to be in Carroll County for maintenance purposes. The remainder of the highway is in Carroll County. Auxiliary route MD 808B is the unsigned designation for Spring Mills Road, a spur from MD 27 that preserves a section of old alignment of MD 27 south of Westminster.

The building is located in Stuart, Iowa, United States. The parish used the building as its church until a devastating fire severely damaged the structure. The church was rebuilt and it now serves as a cultural center called the Historic All Saints/Saints Center for Culture and the Arts. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and is a rare example of Neo-Byzantine architecture in the state of Iowa. History =Development= The Catholic Church in Stuart traces its beginnings to August 1871 when a Father Moniahan from Des Moines came to town for the first time to celebrate Mass. He would come at irregular intervals and Mass was celebrated in school rooms, Shield's Hall, and in private homes. At this time the whole state of Iowa was part of the Diocese of Dubuque. The first church was built in 1874 under the direction of the Rev. Edward Gaul. It was dedicated by the Very Rev. J.F. Brazil from St. Ambrose in Des Moines on the Feast of All Saints, November 1, 1877. The Rev. James Foley was pastor at the time and he built two additions onto the church as well as the rectory during his 24 years at All Saints. During that time he was also responsible for parishes in Casey, Adair, Guthrie Center and Greenfield. The parish became a part of the Diocese of Davenport when it was established in 1881. =Historic Church= The church before the 1995 fire. On October 12, 1902, the Rev. M.S. McNamara became pastor. It was during his pastorate that plans for a new church were developed and executed. Maginnis and Walsh were responsible for designing the church. The cornerstone was laid in September 1908 and it was completed in 1910. It was built of blue Bedford limestone in a combination of Byzantine Revival and Romanesque Revival styles. The building measures wide, long and high. It has a seating capacity of 600. The interior is under an high dome that contains 16 windows. The dome was covered in copper. The church was decorated with Italian marble, rare woods, hand painted frescos, gold gilding, and statuary. The windows were from the Franz Mayer & Co. of Munich, Germany. The church was built for $65,000. Bishop James Davis of Davenport dedicated the church at a Pontifical High Mass. Bishop James J. Keane of Cheyenne, Wyoming, preached the sermon. The following year the parish became part of the Diocese of Des Moines when it was established in 1911 on the same day that Bishop Keane was named Archbishop of Dubuque. =Destructive Fire and the Aftermath= On August 22, 1995 Charles Willard of Des Moines drove to Stuart and poured gasoline in various places in the church and set it on fire. Fire departments from 20 area communities in a radius of Stuart fought the fire. While the exterior walls remained standing the rest of the building lay in ruins. A small chapel in the back suffered minor damage. Willard had mailed letters to two bishops and a Des Moines television station before he set the fire taking responsibility based on his hatred of the Catholic Church. He even held a news conference before his arrest. He was convicted of arson and a hate crime. The parish, under the leadership of the Rev. Dan Clarke, and the diocese decided that to rebuild the church would be too expensive. Instead they decided to build a new facility on of land purchased from the Bill and Marlene Wilson family for $475,000. The new church, designed by the Renaissance Design Group of Omaha, has seating for 400 people and a parking lot for 175 cars. The cost for the new church was $2.5 million. Bishop Joseph Charron, C.Pp.S. laid the cornerstone for the new church on August 31, 1997. In September 1997 the damaged historic church building and property were sold to a group named the Project Restore Foundation for $7,200. They had hoped to rehabilitate the building in three years for a community cultural center at an estimated cost of around $3.5 million. The architects for the restoration project were Kirk Blunck and Jeff Wagner of HLKB in Des Moines and construction was done by Koester in Grimes. Plans called for the exterior of the old church to look similar to the way it looked before the fire, The interior would have a modern appearance with exposed stone and brick on the walls. The dome would be rebuilt with the original stone, which had been numbered and saved. The original copper on the dome melted so it was replaced with new copper sheeting. Several grants helped with the restoration effort. In 2000 the State Historical Society of Iowa Board of Trustees approved a grant for $60,000 towards the project. In 2007 Project Restore received a $545,000 grant from Vision Iowa, a state program that provides money for major tourism attractions. That same year 63% of the citizens of Stuart voted to accept a $1.7 million bond referendum to rebuild the church. Another $232,000 (as of 2007) in private donations was also raised, A small chapel on the west side of the church and the former sacristy was the first part of the project that was finished in 2002-2003. A group of Serbian Orthodox Christians started using the chapel for a monthly liturgy in 2005. The new dome was lifted into place in October 2008. Work on the interior continued after that and was completed in 2010.

It has been described as ranging in color from dark grizzly-gray to almost white,Glover, A. (1942), Extinct and vanishing mammals of the western hemisphere, with the marine species of all the oceans, American Committee for International Wild Life Protection, p. 209. and of being closely related to the Newfoundland wolf (C. l. beothucus). This wolf is recognized as a subspecies of Canis lupus in the taxonomic authority Mammal Species of the World (2005). History Due to over-hunting in the early 1900s, Labrador wolf sightings were infrequent through the 1950s. Around that time period, the caribou population began to increase at a steady rate, which then correlated with an increase in the wolf population. However, the increase in number of the Labrador wolf was not enough to offset the continuing rise in caribou in the region, causing a reconsideration of the predation limitation hypothesis. In the late 2000s and early 2010s, there were several confirmed and unconfirmed sightings of the Labrador wolf on the island of Newfoundland. In March 2012, a hunter shot and killed a large canine on the Bonavista Peninsula, thinking it to be a coyote; genetic testing found it to be a Labrador wolf. In July 2012, a video posted on YouTube showed a canine which exhibited nearly all of the characteristics of a wolf. The video was taken in Clode Sound, Terra Nova National Park and was captured using a motion-sensitive trail camera set up as part of a joint research project on coastal river otters. On 23 August 2012, the Newfoundland and Labrador Department of Environment and Conservation published the results of genetic testing of a large canine trapped on the Baie Verte Peninsula in 2009, confirming that this animal was also a Labrador wolf.

At the age of 17, Lenz took up cycling, joining the Allegheny Cycle Club, and started exploring the roads of Pennsylvania. He soon went on longer trips, riding his bike as far as New York, St. Louis, New Orleans and Chicago. He was also an avid photographer, who would bring his camera on his biking trips. Journey around the world The Englishman Thomas Stevens had completed the first circumnavigation of the globe by bicycle in 1884 - 1886, and Lenz wanted to make an attempt of his own. He was hired by the magazine Outing (for which Stevens had worked) to publish reports and take photographs from his journey, and set out from the Smithfield Street Bridge in Pittsburgh on a Victory safety bicycle on May 15, 1892 with 800 onlookers wishing him well. Going first to Washington, D.C. and New York he then traveled west across the United States and parts of Canada, reaching San Francisco on October 20. From San Francisco he sailed to Japan, where he rode from Yokohama to Nagasaki before crossing to China. While he seems to have had a pleasant trip through Japan, which he praised in his reports, China proved a tougher stage of his journey. Japan had good roads for the time but the roads in China were in poor condition, especially in winter, and the locals were often hostile or fearful. He had expected to cross China in three months, but it took him six, and he was very happy when he reached Burma, part of the British Empire. The jungles of Burma proved another difficult obstacle, with heavy rain and almost impassable roads, and he also contracted malaria there. Reaching Rangoon he found it impossible to ride his bike the next stage of his journey, and instead crossed by ship to Calcutta. In early October 1893 he left Calcutta, and spent the next month crossing to Lahore. From Lahore he decided to travel south to Karachi, and then traveled by steamer to Bushire in Persia, riding north to Teheran from there. He found Teheran a delightful place, and was loath to leave, but set out for Tabriz in April 1894, hoping to reach Istanbul before the worst of the summer heat. In early May, 1894, almost two years after his departure from Pittsburgh, he set off from Tabriz on the next stage of his journey, with Erzurum as his next objective. He was never heard from again. Search When nothing was heard from Lenz throughout the summer, his family started to worry that something might have happened. The Ottoman Empire was at this time going through a period of turmoil, the ongoing Hamidian Massacres were killing tens of thousands of Armenians. It was difficult to ascertain what might have happened, but Alexander Terrell, the U.S. minister to Turkey, felt sure that Lenz had been killed by Kurdish bandits. Outing Magazine eventually sent another famous bicyclist, William Sachtleben, to Turkey to investigate the circumstances of Lenz' disappearance. Sachtleben had completed his own bike journey around the world in 1892, along with his friend Thomas Allen. He sailed to Europe in March 1895, and traveled to Erzurum, having to forge papers to gain entrance to Kurdistan. In Erzurum, Sachtleben learned that Lenz had somehow insulted a notorious Kurdish chief when passing through a small village. The Kurds then apparently ambushed and killed him, burying his body on the bank of a river. The Kurdish bandit was charged and convicted by the Turkish authorities, but had already fled. Some of the Armenian locals who had helped Sachtleben uncover Lenz' fate were also imprisoned, a couple of them dying in prison. Eventually, some eight years after his death, following pressure from the U.S., the Turkish government agreed to pay a compensation of $7,500 to Lenz' mother.

They were used on the expedition to measure the effects of altitude on respiratory function. The spirometers have been used to measure control of ventilation related to high-altitude pulmonary edema, to determine the efficacy of pharmaceutical treatments for acute mountain sickness, and to determine the efficacy of mechanical treatments for mountain sickness. Boehringer spirometers have also been used in hospital studies, typically related to anesthesia and patient monitoring.

MoMA Artists book bibliography History Founded by Martha Wilson in 1976 as an archive for artist books and variable media, Franklin Furnace gathered the largest collection of artist books in the United States before 1993 when most of the collection, or 13,500 books, was acquired by the Museum of Modern Art. It was first created at a storefront in Tribeca in Manhattan. A FRANKLIN FURNACE ‚ÄòNEST‚Äô, NY Times, November 7, 2014.

Franklin Furnace was one of the first organizations to support and advocate for artist books, which today are still under-recognized and under-valued, especially by larger art and culture institutions. Franklin Furnace was on the front lines during the ‚Äúculture wars‚Äù of the 1980s and 1990s. In 1984, the Morality Action Committee claimed that 500 children per day were exposed to pornography in the Carnival Knowledge show; Franklin Furnace‚Äôs 1992-93 National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) program grant was rescinded by the National Council on the Arts; and in 1996, the Christian Action Network carried a coffin up the steps of the Capitol to call for the death of Franklin Furnace and the NEA. Although today it is a ‚Äúvirtual institution,‚Äù using its website franklinfurnace.org as its public face, in the 1970s and 1980s Franklin Furnace held performances, installations, and exhibits in its performance space at 112 Franklin Street in Lower Manhattan.Organized by Jacki Apple, the Curator of Exhibitions and Performances from 1976-1980, the exhibitions included sculptural books, conceptual books, handmade paper books, photo/text books, painters‚Äô books, fiber and textile books, object books, stretching the definition of book as far as possible. Apple also initiated the bi-weekly performance series focused on text-based works. Rachieff, Melissa.

Current projects =Franklin Furnace Fund= Every year, Franklin Furnace awards grants of $2000‚Äì10,000 to local, national, and international contemporary artists selected by a rotating panel of artists. In 1985, Franklin Furnace started the Fund for Performance Art with the support of the Jerome Foundation. In the spring of 2008, the fund was expanded to include the internet as an art medium and venue. Today the grants most often support performance art as well as ‚Äúvariable media,‚Äù artist books, installation pieces, and electronic media. In June 2009 the peer review panel awarded $64,000 to eleven artists selected from among 424 proposals. =Sequential Art for Kids= Since 1985, Franklin Furnace places contemporary working artists to teach art in public schools. After a ten-year partnership with P.S. 52 in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, Franklin Furnace currently collaborates with P.S. 20, the Clinton Hill Elementary School in Brooklyn. =The Unwritten History Project= After Franklin Furnace‚Äôs collection of artist books was acquired by the Museum of Modern Art, the organization reinvented itself as a ‚Äúvirtual institution‚Äù focused on its online resources. With a National Endowment for the Humanities grant awarded in 2006, Franklin Furnace digitized and published online its event records from its first decade. With the help of this grant, Franklin Furnace began collaboration with ARTstor in order to make its event records available to the colleges and universities who use ARTstor‚Äôs database as an educational resource. In August 2010, Franklin Furnace received a second grant from the NEH, matched by the Booth Ferris Foundation, to digitize and publish its second decade of event records on its website.

It also had long, slender legs and a doglike nose. Pakasuchus lived approximately 105 million years ago, in the mid-Cretaceous. Fossils have been found in the Galula Formation of Rukwa Rift Basin of southwestern Tanzania, and were described in 2010 in the journal Nature. The type species is P. kapilimai. Pakasuchus means \\"cat crocodile\\" (paka meaning \\"cat\\" in Kiswahili) in reference to its cat-like appearance and probable behavior. Description Dentition of Pakasuchus. Gray areas are restored parts of the skull missing in the holotype. Pakasuchus was around long. Like all notosuchians, it was an active terrestrial animal. It probably hunted small prey such as insects. It had a short, broad skull somewhat similar in shape to a cat. Unlike living crocodilians, Pakasuchus had distinctive heterodont teeth that varied in shape throughout its jaws. There are large, sharp teeth near the front of the jaws, and broad molar-like teeth at the back of the mouth. While multicuspid teeth are seen in many other notosuchians such as Simosuchus and Yacarerani, they are most complex in Pakasuchus. The molar-like teeth show a level of complexity that matches that of mammals, being able to occlude, or fit with one another, and provide sharp shearing edges for slicing food. Pakasuchus also differed from modern crocodilians, and many other crocodyliforms, in the reduction of osteoderms covering the body. Small, reduced osteoderms overlie the dorsal vertebrae, but fewer in number and are not as large as those of other notosuchians. However, caudal osteoderms still covered the tail. The loss of osteoderms on the body and retention of them on the tail is unique among crocodyliforms. Discovery A complete skeleton of Pakasuchus was found in 2008 in southwestern Tanzania by an international research team funded by the National Science Foundation and the National Geographic Society as part of the Rukwa Rift Basin Project. Remains from six other individuals were later uncovered. The specific name honors Saidi Kapilima, one of the leaders of the Rukwa Rift Basin Project and who helped in the excavation of the specimens. The most complete specimen includes a nearly complete skull. Because the jaws were closed in this specimen, some of the teeth were obscured. The describers of the specimens used X-ray computed tomography scanning, or CT scanning, to image the teeth. This provided a detailed view of the animal's dentition that could not normally be observed in the specimen. Phylogeny Below is a cladogram modified from O‚ÄôConnor et al., 2010: Paleobiology Pakasuchus was probably very mammal-like in behavior as well as appearance. The molariform teeth are well suited to shearing food like modern mammalian carnivores. In fact, the teeth are so similar to those of mammals that it has led paleontologist Greg Buckley to state \\"If only isolated teeth had been discovered, without the skull, it is very likely that some of the molariform teeth would have been mistaken for a mammal's.\\" The relative lack of osteoderms on the body may have been an adaptation for an active terrestrial lifestyle, as it would have lightened the animal. However, the retention of osteoderms on the tail is hard to explain, as they would have been quite heavy. The long legs and slender build would also have made Pakasuchus more agile. Pakasuchus was probably an herbivore; its dentition was at least as complex as those of modern herbivorous lizards. Notosuchians were widespread across Gondwana throughout the Cretaceous. Pakasuchus, as well as many other notosuchians, would have filled ecological niches in these areas that were otherwise occupied by mammals in the northern continents. Mammals were relatively uncommon in Gondwana at the time, making it possible for notosuchians to occupy a similar niche. The Rukwa Rift Basin is known for a rich vertebrate fauna that existed during the Cretaceous. During the Early Cretaceous, the basin was part of a large river system with braided channels and low-lying vegetated floodplains. Several dinosaurs are known from the basin that would have lived alongside Pakasuchus, including large sauropods and theropods. Aquatic crocodyliforms inhabited the rivers along with turtles and fishes.

The character was created by Lee Falk for the adventure comic strip The Phantom, which debuted in newspapers on February 17, 1936. The Phantom was later depicted in many forms of media, including television shows, movies, and video games. Publication history =Comic strip= Lee Falk's syndicated newspaper comic strip The Phantom premiered on February 17, 1936, with the story \\"The Singh Brotherhood\\", written by Falk and illustrated first by himself, for two weeks, followed by Ray Moore, who was an assistant to artist Phil Davis on Falk's Mandrake the Magician strip. A Sunday Phantom strip was added to newspapers on May 28, 1939. During Moore's World War II military service, he left the strip to his assistant, Wilson McCoy. Upon Moore's return, he worked on the strip on and off until 1949, when McCoy succeeded him.Ray Moore at the Lambiek Comiclopedia Following McCoy's death in 1961, Carmine Infantino and Bill Lignante (who would later draw several Phantom stories directly for comic books) filled in before Sy Barry was chosen as a successor. Barry would continue working on the strip for over 30 years before retiring in 1994. Barry's longtime assistant, George Olesen, remained on the strip as penciller, with Keith Williams joining as the inker for the daily strip. The Sunday strip was inked by Eric Doescher until Fred Fredericks became the regular inker in 1995. Falk continued to script Phantom until his death on March 13, 1999. His last daily and Sunday strip stories, \\"Terror at the Opera\\" and \\"The Kidnappers\\", respectively, were finished by his wife, Elizabeth Falk, after the hospitalized Falk had torn off his oxygen mask to dictate the adventures. After Falk's passing, King Features Syndicate collaborated with the European comics publisher Egmont on the strip. They went from initially publishing Phantom stories in licensed comic books to providing the stories for the newspaper strip by adapting their own comic-book stories. Tony DePaul and Claes Reimerthi alternated as writers of the daily and Sunday newspaper strips, respectively. DePaul would later become the sole writer of the strip. In 2000, Olesen and Fredericks retired from the Sunday strip, which was then taken over by artist Graham Nolan. Olesen and Williams left the daily strip after Olesen retired, and artist Paul Ryan took over the daily in early 2005. Ryan succeeded Nolan as artist on the Sunday strip in 2007. On July 31, 2011, Eduardo Barreto became the Sunday artist. Barreto died after only a few months of working on the strip, and Ryan did the January 15, 2012, Sunday page and the following week's comics before Terry Beatty became Barreto's permanent replacement. =Comic books= Through the 1940s, The Phantom strips were reprinted in David McKay Publications' Ace Comics. The following decade, Harvey Comics published The Phantom comic book. In 1962, Gold Key Comics took over, followed by King Comics in 1966 and Charlton Comics in 1969. This lasted until 1977, with a total of 73 issues being published. Some of the main Phantom artists during these years were Bill Lignante, Don Newton, Jim Aparo, and Pat Boyette. DC Comics published a Phantom comic book from 1988 to 1990. The initial miniseries (dated May‚ÄìAugust 1988) were written by Peter David and drawn by Joe Orlando and Dennis Janke. The subsequent series, written by Mark Verheiden and drawn by Luke McDonnell, ran for 13 issues (March 1989 ‚Äì March 1990). In 1987, Marvel Comics published a four-issue miniseries based on the Defenders of the Earth TV series, written by Stan Lee. A subsequent three- issue Marvel miniseries, The Phantom: The Ghost Who Walks (Feb.-April 1995), was written and drawn by David de Vries and Glenn Lumsden. Marvel released another four-issue miniseries (May‚ÄìAugust 1995) pencilled by Spider-Man co- creator Steve Ditko, based on the Phantom 2040 TV series. One issue featured a pin-up by the original two Spider-Man signature artists, Ditko and John Romita Sr. Beginning in 2002, Moonstone Books published five Phantom graphic novels, written by Tom DeFalco, Ben Raab, and Ron Goulart. In 2003, Moonstone debuted a Phantom comic-book series written by Raab, Rafael Nieves, and Chuck Dixon, and drawn by artists including Pat Quinn, Jerry DeCaire, Nick Derington, Rich Burchett, and EricJ. After 11 issues, Mike Bullock took over scripting, with Gabriel Rearte and Carlos Magno creating the artwork before Silvestre Szilagyi became the regular artist in 2007. In 2006, Moonstone published a retcon of the Phantom's origin, called Legacy, by Raab and Quinn. That same year, the company published a hybrid comic book and prose book it called \\"wide-vision\\", premiering the format with the Phantom story \\"Law of the Jungle\\".

In 2014, Hermes Press announced the publication of a Phantom comic-book miniseries written by Peter David and illustrated by Sal Velluto. It debuted October 31, 2014. For Free Comic Book Day 2015, Hermes published a Phantom comic book with art by Bill Lignante and samples of the new miniseries. Fictional character biography In the jungles of the fictional African country of Bangalla, there is a myth featuring The Ghost Who Walks, a powerful and indestructible guardian of the innocent and fighter of all types of injustice. Because he seems to have existed for generations, many believe him to be immortal. In reality, the Phantom is a legacy hero, descended from 20 previous generations of crimefighters who all adopt the same persona. When a new Phantom takes the task from his dying father, he swears the Oath of the Skull: \\"I swear to devote my life to the destruction of piracy, greed, cruelty, and injustice, in all their forms, and my sons and their sons shall follow me\\". The first Phantom married Christina, the daughter of a Scandinavian sea captain, Eric the Rover. The second Phantom married Marabella, the granddaughter of Christopher Columbus.The name, by Lee Falk Issue 1,000 1979 The comic sometimes runs flashback adventures of previous Phantoms written by various authors who sometimes confuse Phantom history. Current stories have Marabella as the daughter of Columbus and marrying the first Phantom.Captain Walkers Log Book, by Claes Reimerthi No. 1141Marabella, by Claes Reimerthi No. 1192 As Columbus died in 1506 while, according to the new history, Marabella first meets the Phantom in 1544, this results in another inconsistency, requiring her to be at least 38 years old despite being depicted as in her early 20s. Inconsistencies in storylines and histories are not corrected as a mark of respect to authors, but Falk's original history takes precedence.The Marabella Mystery, by Jim Shepherd No. 1192 Although most of the Phantoms have been male, there has been one woman who took up the role: Julie Walker, twin sister of the 17th Phantom. While her brother was injured, Julie donned the Phantom costume and defeated a band of pirates.\\"The Female Phantom\\", by Lee Falk and Wilson McCoy, July 20 ‚Äì October 12, 1952.\\"The Adventures of the Girl Phantom\\", by Dick Wood and Bill Lignante. The Phantom #20, King Comics, January 1967. The present Phantom is the 21st in the line. Unlike most costumed heroes, he has no superhuman powers, relying only on his wits, physical strength, skill with his weapons, and fearsome reputation to fight crime. His real name is Kit Walker. References to \\"Mr. Walker\\" are in the strip often accompanied by a footnote saying \\"For 'The Ghost Who Walks'\\", although some versions of the Phantom's history suggest that Walker was actually the original surname of the man who became the first Phantom. =Origin= The story of the Phantom started with a young sailor named Christopher Walker (sometimes called Christopher Standish in certain versions of the storyThe Singh Brotherhood (1936), by Lee Falk and Ray Moore). Christopher was born in 1516 in Portsmouth.The First Phanton (Fantomet #10/1985), by Claes Reimerthi and Kari Lepp√§nen His father, also named Christopher Walker, had been a seaman since he was a young boy, and was the cabin boy on Christopher Columbus' ship, the Santa Mar√≠a, when he sailed to the Americas. Christopher Jr. became a shipboy on his father's ship in 1526. In 1536, when Christopher was 20 years old, he was a part of what was supposed to be his father's last voyage. The ship was attacked by pirates and Christopher's father was murdered. He was the sole survivor and was washed ashore on a Bengalla beach, where he was found by pygmies of the Bandar tribe, who nursed him back to health and took care of him. He vows revenge on \\"the destruction of piracy, greed, cruelty, and injustice, in all their forms!\\" The Bandars showed Christopher to a cave, which resembled a human skull in appearance. Christopher later carved the features out to enhance this. This Skull Cave became his home. Wearing a costume based on the demon god, Christopher became the first of what would later be known as the Phantom. When he died, his son took over for him, when the second Phantom died, his son took over, and so on. So it would go on through the centuries, causing people to believe that the Phantom was immortal. These people gave him nicknames including \\"The Ghost Who Walks\\" and \\"The Man Who Cannot Die\\".The First Phantom (1975), by Lee Falk and Sy Barry His base is in the Deep Woods of Bengali (originally \\"Bengalla\\", or \\"Bangalla\\" and renamed Denkali in the Indian edition), a fictional country initially said to be set in Asia, near India, but depicted as in Africa during and after the 1960s. The Phantom's base is the fabled Skull Cave, where all of the previous Phantoms are buried. The Phantom is the commander of Bangalla's Jungle Patrol. Because of a betrayal leading to the death of the 14th Phantom, the identity of the commander has been kept hidden from members of the patrol ever since. The Phantom uses several ways to stay in contact. These include radio and a safe with a false bottom. Map of countries printing The Phantom. Green countries have regular Phantom publications, while blue countries print the dailies/Sundays in newspapers. =Kit Walker, the 21st Phantom= The 21st Phantom's birth name is Kit Walker, as was the name of many of the Phantoms before him. Kit was born in the Skull Cave and spent his first years in the jungle of Bangalla. His mother, Maud Thorne McPatrick, who had previously worked as Rita Hayworth's stunt double, was born in Mississippi, where Kit was sent to study when he was 12 years old, living with his aunt Lucy and uncle Jasper in the town of Clarksville, Missouri. Here he met his wife-to-be, Diana Palmer. Kit was an extremely talented sportsman and was predicted to become the world champion in many different events (even knocking out the world heavyweight boxing champion in a sparring match when the champion visited Clarksville). Despite the opportunity to choose practically any career he wanted, Kit faithfully returned to Bengalla to take over the role of the Phantom when he received word from Guran that his father was dying from a knife- wound.\\"Childhood of the Phantom\\" (1959) by Lee Falk and Wilson McCoy One of Kit's first missions as the Phantom was to find his father's killer, Rama Singh, who had betrayed and murdered the 20th Phantom by first helping him to blow up a fleet of ships owned by the Singh Brotherhood, only to then stab him in the back, stealing his special gunbelt in the process. The 21st Phantom eventually found him and reclaimed the belt at the island of Gullique, but before he could avenge his father and bring the killer to jail, the desperate Rama blew up his lair, killing himself and his henchmen in the process.\\"The Belt\\" (1954) by Lee Falk and Wilson McCoy The Phantom has two animal helpers, a mountain wolf named Devil and a horse named Hero. He also has a trained falcon named Fraka. From 1962 on, The Phantom raised an orphan named \\"Rex King\\", who was later revealed to be the prince of the kingdom of Baronkhan. He also has two dolphins named Solomon and Nefertiti, and numerous other animals kept on the island of Eden. In 1978, he married his sweetheart, Diana Palmer, who works at the United Nations. The Phantom and Diana have two children, Kit and Heloise.\\"The Name\\" by Lee Falk and Sy Barry. September 9 ‚Äì December 9, 1979. His chief aide and ally is Guran, chief of the local pygmy Bandar tribe, who are the only tribe to know the Phantom's true nature. Guran is the Phantom's best friend since childhood and a supporter of his cause. Other allies of the 21st Phantom include Doctor Axel, a Scandinavian doctor working in Bangalla,\\"Dr. Axel and the Witchmen\\", Lee Falk and Wilson McCoy, August 1 ‚Äì October 8, 1955. and Miss Tagama, the African teacher of Rex, Kit and Heloise.\\"Yes\\", Lee Falk and Sy Barry, December 7, 1970 ‚Äì February 13, 1971. =Costume and weapons= As part of the official uniform, the Phantom wears a black domino mask and a purple skintight bodysuit. He also carries period- appropriate sidearms, currently two M1911 pistols in a special belt with a skull-like buckle. Falk has insisted that the Phantom only uses his guns to shoot out the guns of his opponents, a fact that writer Peter David was unaware of when he wrote DC Comics' 1988 four-issue Phantom miniseries, in which he had the Phantom shoot to wound his enemies.Peter David. \\"But I Digress...\\" Comics Buyer's Guide #1325; April 9, 1999; Page 58 However, there are some early instances (in the Lee Falk strips) of the Phantom using his guns to shoot and kill people (sometimes in self-defense). While there had been masked crime fighters like the costumed Zorro, The Shadow, or the business-suited The Clock, the Phantom was the first fictional character to wear the skintight costume and eyes with no visible pupils that has become a trademark of superheroes. Creator Lee Falk had originally envisioned a gray costume and even considered naming his creation \\"The Gray Ghost\\". It was not until the Phantom Sunday strip debuted in 1939 that the costume was shown to be purple. Falk, however, continued to refer to the costume as gray in the text of the strip on several occasions afterward, but finally accepted the purple color. In a Sunday strip story published in the 1960s it was shown that the first Phantom chose the costume based on the appearance of a jungle idol, and colored the cloth with purple jungle berries. As part of a modernization of the character in the Moonstone Books' series, The Phantom: Ghost Who Walks, the Phantom began wearing a costume made of kevlar.Tate, Ray. Review: Phantom: The Ghost Who Walks #2, ComicsBulletin.com, May 16, 2009 = The Phantom Rings = A signature of the character is his two rings. One has a pattern formed like four crossing sabres, \\"The Good Mark\\", that he leaves on visitors whom he befriends, placing the person under his protection. The other, \\"The Evil Mark\\" or \\"Skull Mark\\" has a skull shape, which leaves a scar of the corresponding shape on the enemies he punches with it. He wears the Good Mark on his left hand because it is closer to the heart, and the Evil Mark on his right hand. According to the Team Fantomen stories, the Skull Ring was given to the first Phantom by Paracelsus.\\"The Ring\\" by Ulf Granberg and Jaime Vallv√©, The Phantom, Frew Publications, December 20, 2002. The original owner of the Skull Ring was Emperor Nero of the Roman empire and it would later be revealed that the ring had been made from the nails that hung Jesus to the cross. The Good Mark ring was made after the sixth Phantom founded the Jungle Patrol.The ring of Death, by Claes Reimerthi and Kari Lepp√§nnen =Enemies= The most dangerous and lasting enemy of the Phantom is the Singh Brotherhood, active for centuries and responsible for the death of the 21st Phantom's father.Hubert H. Crawford, Crawford's Encyclopedia of Comic Books. Middle Village, N.Y. : Jonathan David Publishers, 1978. (pp. p. 89-91, 404) In the 1970s, Falk's comics changed the group's name to the \\"Sengh Brotherhood\\", or \\"Sanngh Brotherhood\\". This is because \\"Singh\\" is a common name in India, and Falk wished to avoid offending Indian readers by implying that the organization originated in that country.Franco Fossati, \\"The Phantom\\", in I Grandi Eroi del Fumetto, by Fossati Rome : Gremese Editore, 1990 (pp. 240‚Äì243). The group's name was changed to \\"the Singa Pirates\\" in the Indian comics for the same reason. In Egmont's Phantom comics, the brotherhood has evolved into a modern company called Singh Corporations. Another criminal organization that the Phantom repeatedly clashes with is the Sky Band, a group of all-female air pirates. Frequent antagonists of successive Phantoms are the depraved inhabitants of the \\"Eastern Dark\\" region (also known as \\"Dakk\\") who carry out human sacrifice and drug trafficking. The Phantom's repeated role in thwarting the activities of the Dakk people is the source of his \\"Guardian of the Eastern Dark\\" title.\\"Guardian of the Eastern Dark\\", Lee Falk and Sy Barry.

Recurring villainous characters in the newspaper strips are pirate leader Baron Grover, terrorist commander Skul, warmonger General Bababu, and international terrorist The Python. Antagonists in the Team Fantomen stories include larcenous art collector Jason Parnassos, thief Vasti Riba,\\"The Phantom's Unknown Sister\\" by Idi Kharelli and Georges Bess,The Phantom #1454, Frew Publications, August 25, 2006. dictator Prince Grigor, murderous treasure hunter Bail, and Goldhand, named for his prosthetic hand made of solid gold.\\"The Return of Goldhand\\" by Tony DePaul and Heiner Bade, The Phantom #1217.

In other media =Novels and short stories= Whitman The first novel about the Phantom was published in 1944 by Whitman Publishing Company, and was called \\"The Son of the Phantom\\". Written by Dale Robertson, the book was based on Lee Falk's comic strip story \\"Childhood of the Phantom\\", although Falk had no involvement with the novel. It featured a cover drawn by Wilson McCoy. Avon Avon Publications in the United States put out 15 books based on Lee Falk's stories. The series ran from 1972 to 1975, and was written by several authors, including Falk; the covers were done by George Wilson. Many of the books were translated into foreign languages. # The Story of the Phantom: The Ghost Who Walks 1972, Lee Falk # The Slave Market of Mucar 1972, Basil Copper # The Scorpia Menace 1972, Basil Copper # The Veiled Lady 1973, Frank S.

To coincide with the 1996 Phantom movie, Avon published The Phantom, based on the Paramount Pictures film. It was written by Rob MacGregor. Hermes Press also published a reprint of the Avon novels. Moonstone Books In 2007, Moonstone Books released The Phantom Chronicles, a collection of short stories written by authors Mike Bullock, Ron Fortier, Jim Alexander, David Michelinie, Craig Shaw Gardner, CJ Henderson, Clay and Susan Griffith, Will Murray, Mike Oliveri, Nancy Kilpatrick, Ed Rhoades, David Bishop, Grant Suave, Trina Robbins, Richard Dean Starr, Dan Wickline, and Martin Powell. The book was released in both a softcover and limited hardcover edition, and featured an introduction written by Lee Falk's daughter, Valerie Falk. The Phantom Chronicles 2 was released in 2010. It features a story where the Phantom teams up with Green Hornet, written by Harlan Ellison, and has a foreword written by Diane Falk. Other appearances In Umberto Eco's novel, The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana, the main character describes his childhood experiences of reading The Phantom, as well as other comic strip characters like Flash Gordon and Mandrake the Magician. The book also features illustrations of the Phantom, drawn by Ray Moore. In Papua New Guinea, the Wahgi people have used images of the Phantom on their ceremonial war shields, or \\"kumbe reipe\\". Art historian N.F. Karlins believes that comic books featuring the Phantom may have been brought to Papua New Guinea by American troops as early as the 1940s.Pop Tribal, by N.F. Karlins; at Artnet; published June 28, 2007; retrieved December 31, 2013 The Phantom's popularity amongst the Wahgi has been attributed to his being a \\"man who cannot die\\", and who vanquishes his enemies by using his \\"strength, intelligence, and fearsome reputation\\";Kumba reipe (fighting shield) (early 1980s) (by Wahgi people), at the Art Gallery of New South Wales; 2013; retrieved December 31, 2013 Karlins has suggested that, as Wahgi warriors wear masks, the Phantom's own mask may have also been a contributing factor. Similarly, anthropologist Susan Cochrane has described the Wahgi interpretation of the Phantom as being a \\"modern spirit\\".Art and Life in Melanesia, by Susan Cochrane; 2007, by Cambridge Scholars Press =Live-action adaptations= The Phantom serials A 15-episode, 240-minute movie serial, starring Tom Tyler in the title role, was made in 1943 by Columbia Pictures and directed by action specialist B. Reeves Eason, featuring Jeanne Bates as Diana Palmer, Frank Shannon as her uncle Professor Davidson, and Ace the Wonder Dog as Devil. Creator Lee Falk was billed on screen as \\"Leon Falk.\\" The story shows the 21st Phantom's first mission after taking over the mantle of the Ghost Who Walks from his murdered father: to find the Lost City of Zoloz and prevent the evil Dr. Bremmer, played by Kenneth MacDonald, from building a secret airbase in the jungle. The serial has been released on DVD through VCI. The Phantom's real name in the serial was Geoffrey Prescott, as the alias of Kit Walker had not been mentioned in the strip at that point. However, he goes by the alias of Mr. Walker after having become the Phantom. Two episodes loosely adapted Lee Falk's story \\"The Fire Princess\\" for the screen, and fit it into the plot of the Phantom's fight against Dr. Bremmer. Tom Tyler in costume bore a striking resemblance to the comic-strip character, and the serial was a success. In 1955, when Columbia's serial producer Sam Katzman was making low-budget remakes of older cliffhangers, he cast John Hart in a sequel, filmed as Return of the Phantom. Hart's new scenes as the Phantom were combined with older scenes of Tom Tyler in the identical costume. Unfortunately Katzman failed to check with the studio's legal department, and found that its rights to the Phantom character had lapsed. Katzman, unwilling to meet the rights holder's high price, reshot much of the action with Hart in a vaguely similar costume (helmet, mask, sweater, and riding breeches) to match the old footage with Tom Tyler. Katzman, having been forced to delete many of the action scenes from The Phantom, filled the gaps with scenes from two more old serials, The Desert Hawk and Jungle Menace. The new mashup was finally released as The Adventures of Captain Africa. The Phantom (1996) The Phantom was also adapted into a live-action movie in 1996. Produced and released by Paramount Pictures, the movie was set in the 1930s, and incorporated elements from several of the Phantom's earliest comic-strip adventures. It starred Billy Zane in the title role, Kristy Swanson as Diana Palmer, and Catherine Zeta-Jones as Sala, an aviatrix. It was directed by Simon Wincer, after director Joe Dante and producer Michael Douglas dropped out of the project, and was written by Jeffrey Boam, who also wrote Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Cult-icon Bruce Campbell was another choice for the role, but Zane, already a huge fan of the comic strip since being introduced to Australian Frew comics on the set of Dead Calm, ended up getting the part after actively lobbying for it for years. After his casting, he pumped iron for a year and a half to fill the Phantom's costume, refusing to wear a costume with moulded muscles. He also closely studied panels of the comic to capture the character's body language. Though the film was not a theatrical success, it was the reason why Zane was cast as Caledon Hockley in Titanic, the world's third most commercially successful film, and has sold well on VHS and DVD. The movie was filmed on location in Australia, Thailand, and Los Angeles, and featured the Phantom in his attempt to stop madman Xander Drax (Treat Williams) from obtaining a weapon of doom, the legendary \\"Skulls of Touganda\\". The story also features the Singh Brotherhood, the all-female clan of air pirates known as the Sky Band, of whom Sala is the leader and a subplot wherein the 21st Phantom recovers his father's gunbelt and avenges his father's murder, inspired by the Lee Falk/Wilson McCoy story \\"The Belt\\". The film also has elements taken from the 1936 story \\"The Singh Brotherhood\\", the first Phantom story, and its 1937 continuation \\"The Sky Band\\". In 2008, syndicated gossip columnist Liz Smith claimed that Paramount was putting a sequel into development, with Zane returning to play the title role, because of the good VHS and DVD sales of the first film.Smith, Liz, \\"'Phantom' of Cinema Returns\\" , New York Post, September 4, 2008 The Phantom was released on Blu-ray February 2010 by Lionsgate. The Phantom: Legacy On December 15, 2008, it was announced that Sherlock Symington Productions had secured the rights to the Phantom, and were set to make a film called The Phantom: Legacy (unrelated to the Moonstone Books 2006 graphic novel of the same name and any other screen incarnation of the character). The film was set to have a budget of $130 million, and be written by Tim Boyle. Bruce Sherlock, executive producer and head of Sherlock Symington Productions, said that The Phantom: Legacy would follow the lead of films like The Dark Knight and Iron Man, and present a serious treatment of the character. The film will be set in the present day, and revolve around the relationship between the Phantom and his son, and what it means to be the Phantom. Work on the film was expected to begin in 2009. Filming was scheduled to take place in Australia, and producers were in talks with both Australian and international actors to work on the film. In an interview with Dark Horizons, Boyle said the film would feature two main antagonists, one taken from the comic and one created for the movie. The Phantom's costume was expected to be updated for the screen, with Boyle seeking to make it more reality-based. Characters such as Diana Palmer, Kit, Heloise Walker, Colonel Worubu, President Lamanda Luaga, and Guran would appear. The film was said to be heavily focused on the mythology of the comics, with a lot of screen time expected to be devoted to the origin of the 1st Phantom. The Phantom's eyes behind his mask would be white, unlike in previous film-versions. Actor Sam Worthington was considered to play the Phantom, after having worked with Boyle on the film Fink. Boyle was originally considered to direct the movie, but in 2011 confirmed he was only attached as the writer. 2014 announcement It was announced in 2014 that Mark Gordon and his production company were developing a new film with Management 360, Drew Simon was executive producing, and they were currently looking for a new writer on the script. Cameos The Phantom made an appearance alongside other King Features characters in the 1972 animated movie Popeye Meets the Man Who Hated Laughter. He also appeared in the animated Beatles movie Yellow Submarine. Unauthorized versions At least three unauthorized Phantom movies were made in Turkey. Two were made in 1968 and both were titled Kƒ±zƒ±l Maske (the Turkish name for the Phantom, translated as \\"Red Mask\\"). The Phantom was played by Ismet Erten and Irfan Atasoy. The costume worn by Irfan Atasoy bears little resemblance to the one seen in the comic strip, but the uniforms worn by Ismet Erten and in Kƒ±zƒ±l Maske'nin Intikamƒ± (Revenge of the Red Mask), released in 1971, stayed close to the original outfit. =Television= 1961 pilot An unaired color Phantom TV-pilot was made in 1961 starring Roger Creed as the Phantom, with Lon Chaney Jr. and Paulette Goddard as the antagonists, and Richard Kiel as the assassin \\"Big Mike\\". Called \\"No Escape\\", the pilot saw the Phantom breaking up a slave camp in the jungle. Made on a limited budget, the pilot features fight scenes and the Phantom terrorizing villains in the jungle. Writer John Carr originally wrote four episodes, but because the pilot was not picked up by a network, the remaining three were never filmed. Actress Marilyn Manning had originally been cast as Diana Palmer, but never appeared in the pilot.Friends of the Phantom No. 22 page #? date? article title? author? Devil, Hero, and the Jungle Patrol all appear throughout the course of the story. The pilot was shown at the Mid-Atlantic Nostalgia Convention in 2008 and has also been shown at Comic Con in San Diego. Defenders of the Earth In Defenders of the Earth, which ran from 1986 to 1987, the 27th Phantom, voiced by actor Peter Mark Richman, teams up with fellow King Features adventurers Flash Gordon, Mandrake the Magician, and Mandrake's bodyguard and assistant Lothar. The cartoon also featured a daughter, Jedda Walker, who briefly took on the Phantom mantle in an episode where she believed her father to have perished. Other episodes of the series featured classic Phantom villains like the Sky Band, the Phantom's evil older brother Kurt Walker (created specifically for the show), and a flashback to the days of the first Phantom. The episode \\"Return of the Sky Band\\" also featured lengthy flashbacks to the Phantom of Lee Falk's comic strip, the 21st Phantom, showing him and his wife, Diana Palmer, and their encounter with the original Sky Band. In the original presentation pilot for the series, the Phantom had a son, Kit Walker, and Flash Gordon had a daughter, but this was changed for the final series. In Defenders of the Earth, the Phantom was able to use supernatural means to give himself increased strength and speed, by saying the incantation: \\"By jungle law, the ghost who walks calls forth the power of ten tigers!\\" It is only in this cartoon series that the Phantom has such an ability. In the series, the Phantom also used a special helicopter nicknamed the Skull Copter, and had an updated Skull Ring that would shoot a laser on to the faces of antagonists, marking them for life. The complete series has been released on DVD in several editions, the latest in 2010. Phantom 2040 Premiering in 1994 to widespread critical acclaim, Phantom 2040 depicts the adventures of the 24th Phantom on a future Earth rife with pollution and heavy industrialization. Young Kit Walker, was living happily with his aunt Heloise (daughter of the 21st Phantom) in the city of Metropia (previously known as New York) in the year 2040, knowing nothing about his family's legacy, when one day, The Phantom's friend Guran turned up to reveal the secret of the Phantom legacy. Kit takes up the mantle of the Phantom, and starts a battle against the evil company Maximum Inc., and their plans for the \\"Maximum Era\\" (a horrific plan for world domination through mass extinction by the complete collapse of Earth's ecosystem). He also tries to solve the mystery of the death of his father, the 23rd Phantom. This animated series, created by David J. Corbett and Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens, lasted two seasons (35 episodes) and spawned a number of merchandise tie-ins, a comic book series, and a video game. The show's ahead-of-its time voice casting and vocal direction by Stuart M. Rosen had a lasting impact on animated adventure television, introducing (alongside Andrea Romano's acclaimed work on Batman: The Animated Series) a new level of maturity and complexity to animated vocal performance that set the standard for all TV animation that followed. The Phantom was voiced by actor Scott Valentine and J.D.Hall played The Phantom's mentor Guran. Margot Kidder voiced main antagonist Rebecca Madison while Jeff Bennett played her sociopathic son Max Madison Jr. Ron Perlman (and, later, Richard Lynch) played tortured cyborg Graft, Debbie Harry played Vaingloria, and Mark Hamill lent his voice to the character of Dr. Jak. The first four episodes of the series were edited into a feature-length film and released on VHS in 1994 and 1996 (and later on DVD in 2004), called Phantom 2040: The Ghost Who Walks. Other episodes of the series were released on VHS in 1995. Season One (containing the first 20 episodes of the show) was released on DVD in Australia in 2013. Betaal Pachisi A series aired on Doordarshan in 1997 named Betaal Pachisi depicting the 25th Phantom played by Shahbaz Khan. He is shown fighting poachers and supernatural entities. Krutika Desai Khan plays Naina Jogan, the jungle spirit in love with Betaal (the Phantom). Sonu Walia plays a TV reporter who becomes his love interest. The Phantom (Syfy) On July 29, 2008, screenwriter Daniel Knauf announced he and his son and collaborator Charles Knauf had completed a four-hour TV-movie script for Sci Fi Channel, later renamed Syfy, starring the 22nd Phantom.Rogers, Vaneta. \\"SDCC '08 ‚Äì The Knaufs Bring the Phantom to Sci Fi\\", Newsarama, July 29, 2008 On March 23, 2009, the Sci Fi Channel announced that they formally ordered a 4-hour mini-series in two parts, which also served as a backdoor pilot. The mini-series, simply called The Phantom, was produced by Muse Entertainment and RHI Entertainment. It premiered in Canada on The Movie Network in December 2009, as a two-part mini-series, a total of three hours. Ryan Carnes stars as the Phantom, with Paolo Barzman directing. The series was shot in New York City, Costa Rica and Montreal. The story sees law student Kit learning that he was adopted, and that he is actually the son of the 21st Phantom and Diana Palmer Walker. He joins the Phantom team in the jungles of Bengalla (in this version, Bengalla is a small island in Indonesia), and is trained in martial arts and combat, emerging as the next Phantom to battle the Singh Brotherhood and save the only man who can bring peace to the Middle East. The 22nd Phantom wears a modified costume that is highly resistant to bullets, blades and falls, doubles his strength and can make him move faster. The mini-series aired on Syfy in June 2010, and was released on Blu-ray and DVD by Vivendi Entertainment. Parodies Paul Hogan, of Crocodile Dundee fame, continually parodied the Phantom on his Australian TV-show, The Paul Hogan Show. He would dress up in the purple Phantom costume, and act out different humorous situations. The Phantom had also been frequently parodied on Scandinavian television, in different humor programs. In 1984, Australian stand-up comedian Austen Tayshus released a single Phantom Shuffle in the video of which he appeared in Phantom costume, wearing sunglasses instead of a mask. Many elements of the Phantom myth were parodied, such as him being \\"Mr Walker, the man who cannot drive\\". In 2017, Australian comedian Sammy J began touring with a new show, Hero Complex, in which he pays tribute to what he says is the role the Phantom has played in his life: \\"a chance encounter set off a chain of events that led to me meeting my wife and ended with police searching my attic\\".https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/mar/28/sammy-j- the-phantom-may-be-a-dud-superhero-but-he-changed-my-life Hero Complex has won a \\"Best Comedy\\" award or nomination in every festival in which it has featured. In the Adult Swim show The Venture Bros., the character The Phantom Limb bears a strong visual resemblance to the Phantom, right down to the same purple suit and mask, except that the Phantom Limb's limbs are invisible, making him look like a floating torso. However, The Phantom Limb is a villainous character. The myth surrounding the Phantom also provided Turkish humorists with a lot of material. The humor magazine Leman has published many comic strips some of which were inspired by the (imaginary) saying \\"in the jungle, it is rumored that the Phantom has the strength of ten tigers\\" where Phantom runs into trouble with 11 or more tigers. The Phantom was parodied in a 2007 episode of Robot Chicken titled \\"Werewolf vs. Unicorn\\", where he appeared alongside Flash Gordon and Mandrake the Magician. He was voiced by Frank Welker. The Phantom was a frequently appearing character in the Finnish comic strip Fingerpori by Pertti Jarla. He was often involved in humorous situations such as using his throne as a toilet seat. Documentaries In 1996, the A&E; Network created a documentary about the history of the Phantom for television, called The Phantom: Comic Strip Crusader. Narrated by Peter Graves, it featured interviews with creator Lee Falk, actors Billy Zane and Kristy Swanson, director Simon Wincer, Frew-editor Jim Shepherd, George Olesen, Keith Williams, and president of the US Phantom fan club Friends of the Phantom, Ed Rhoades. The documentary was released on DVD in 2006. To promote the 1996 Paramount Phantom movie, an HBO special called \\"Making of The Phantom\\" was made. It featured behind-the-scenes information on the movie and the comic. An original documentary presentation called History of the Phantom was shown at the Mid-Atlantic Nostalgia Convention in September 2008. MythBusters \\"Superhero Hour\\" On MythBusters season 5, episode 17 \\"Superhero Hour\\", it was tested whether the Phantom's skull ring would make an imprint on someone when you punch them while wearing it, as it did in the comic. The result was that the myth was \\"busted\\", in that hitting a person in the face hard enough to leave a ring imprint on the skin required more than enough force to crush a human skull. In the comic, it had been revealed that the Phantom's ring actually had sharp edges and was covered with a permanent ink synthesized from plants found in the depths of the Bengallan jungle, leaving a permanent scar-like mark. It was, in effect, an instant tattoo. =Video games= The Phantom has appeared as a playable character in two video games, Phantom 2040 and Defenders of the Earth. Both were based on the animated series with the same titles. However, in Defenders of the Earth, the Phantom was not the only playable character, as players were given the choice to control Mandrake the Magician and Flash Gordon as well. In Phantom 2040, released on Sega Genesis, Game Gear, and Super NES, the Phantom was the only playable character. He had use of a number of his special skills and high-tech gadgets from the Phantom 2040 TV-series. The game had a complex storyline and featured several different endings, which were dependent on the choices the player made during the game. In 2003, a video game made for Game Boy Advance was announced, called \\"The Phantom: The Ghost Who Walks\\". It was developed by 7th Sense and produced by Microids, and it was described as a free-roaming jungle adventure. During the development process, Microids went bankrupt, and the game was never released. In 2006, The Phantom Mobile Game became available for cellphones, where the Phantom fought zombies, floating skulls, and other magical creatures to find his kidnapped wife, Diana Palmer. It was described as a free-roaming jungle adventure, with a film-like plot. =Theme park= \\"Fantomenland\\" (\\"Phantom Land\\") was a part of the Swedish zoo Parken Zoo, Eskilstuna, where audiences could visit the Skull Cave, and several other places from the comic, like the Whispering Grove and the headquarters of the Jungle Patrol. Visitors could also meet actors dressed up as the Phantom and witness short plays featuring the characters of the comic. Fantomenland was inaugurated by Lee Falk in 1986. Fantomenland closed in April 2010. =Fine art= A gallery in Brisbane, Australia, ran an exhibit of Phantom-inspired artwork in 1973. Australian Galleries ran an exhibit, \\"The Phantom Show\\", consisting of traditional art inspired by the Phantom, from December 9‚Äì21, 2014.

The player must collect the eggs to prevent the scientist from using them to build a doomsday device, while avoiding the ducks and other obstacles.  Gameplay  240px The player uses the joystick to control a robot that explores the scientist's lair, picking up eggs, weapons, and other useful objects. When two eggs are found and brought to the appropriate exit, the player advances to the next level. The player starts with three lives (robots) and loses a life when eaten by a duck or hit by the ducks' fire or another deadly object. Additional lives and various power-ups can be earned by picking up colored balloons. The player can choose to play with all objects either in a predetermined location, or randomly distributed throughout the rooms in the game.

Built circa 1822, this three-story brick Federal structure lies along the original National Road and near the old road that connects Springfield with Dayton, Ohio.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 133. In the early years of the nineteenth century, the National and Dayton-Springfield Roads were major transportation arteries for those bound for the West and for Cincinnati respectively. Inns such as the Pennsylvania House were instrumental in facilitating travel for the many would-be settlers and merchants headed for the western frontier and for all sorts of travellers proceeding southwest. Before the coming of the railroads, the Pennsylvania House provided beds and food for commoners and famous individuals alike. According to local lore, among the inn's guests were such individuals as Henry Clay, Charles Dickens, Andrew Jackson, and James K. Polk. The inn's owners typically lived on the premises; among the various owners were the family of Isaac Kaufmann Funk, founder of Funk and Wagnalls. Appearance in or shortly before 1908 After more than twenty years of prosperity, the inn's traffic shrank after railroads reached Springfield in 1846. By the end of the Civil War, travellers on the National Road were so rare that the Pennsylvania House saw very little traffic indeed, and it closed in 1869. Despite its closure, the building has remained in fine condition for well over one hundred years; architectural elements such as the double-hung windows and the ornate six-panel doors have survived with little damage. In recognition of the inn's place in American history and of its well-preserved historic architecture, the Pennsylvania House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Today, the Pennsylvania House is operated as a history museum with a concentration on the National Road.Pennsylvania House Museum Info , Pennsylvania House Museum, n.d. Accessed 2010-08-04.

The port is a remnant of an abandoned design feature for addition of internal RAM and a clock for time keeping.

Although a real-time clock can be connected to the port, the clock was typically added by other means (usually integrated on CPU or RAM expansions) which leave the clock port free.

However, as the address and data signals used by the interface are available through the internal expansion connectors of other Amiga models, clock port adaptors were later created by third-party developers for these systems. This enables owners of other popular models, such as the Amiga 500 or Amiga 600, to use the hardware created for this interface.

U.S. Army intelligence had located a large number of Taliban and al Qaeda personnel operating in the Shah-e-Kot Valley, near the Pakistani border. Within the valley were the three villages of Sherkhankhel, Babukhel, and Marzak. Operation Anaconda would block Taliban and al Qaeda forces inside the valley where they could be destroyed before escaping into Pakistan.Billingsley, D. (2002).

The air mission consisted of eight 7-101 CH-47 aircraft divided into two flights of four, carrying infantry from the 101st Airborne and 10th Mountain Divisions. As resupply was not guaranteed at the time, the onboard infantry were heavily laden with ample food, water, cold-weather clothing, night-vision and communications equipment in addition to weapons and ammunition. Some individuals carried a hundred pounds or more.Billingsley, D. (2002). Chopper in the Coils: Operation Anaconda was a back to basics campaign for US combat helicopters.

The date for the attack had initially been planned for 25 February, but bad weather forced a delay until 2 March. The helicopters would land just after the start of morning nautical twilight, as mission planners weighed the options of attacking under the cover of darkness or during daylight hours. It was finally decided to insert at sunrise to catch the enemy asleep yet provide optimal vision for the forces entering the valley. The Apaches entered the valley first to provide overwatch of the helicopter landing zones. The attack aircraft radioed back the call of \\"ice\\", a military term for an uncontested landing. Though the aircraft were able to disembark infantry without incident, the ground force began taking small arms fire immediately after their departure.Billingsley, D. (2002). Chopper in the Coils: Operation Anaconda was a back to basics campaign for US combat helicopters. The Journal of Electronic Defense (JED). After this initial period, the infantry and supporting Chinooks would require repeated air to ground fire support from the accompanying Apaches and USAF assets. The Taliban began to target the aircraft, and on the first day of the operation, five out of seven AH-64s were put out of action by ground fire.Billingsley, D. (2002). Chopper in the Coils: Operation Anaconda was a back to basics campaign for US combat helicopters. The Journal of Electronic Defense (JED). After the initial engagements on his forces, Colonel Frank Wiercinski (ground forces commander), decided to move his mobile command team off of the airborne command post and directly control fighting from the ground. The 159th Blackhawks would insert this element as wave two of the operation, and proceeded directly to the pre-designated HLZ. As there was only room for one Blackhawk at this landing site, the aircraft would take turns making use of the location to land, disembark the passengers, and quickly take off again. On ingress to this HLZ, the lead helicopter began to take small arms fire. Just before touch down, a RPG exploded below the lead Black Hawk and sent shrapnel into the airframe directly under the pilot's seat. The pilot continued the approach and safely deposited half the Brigade TAC before departing. The second aircraft immediately followed with the rest of the TAC.Billingsley, D. (2002).

White trails of smoke showed the path the RPGs had taken. An RPG strike to the tail rotor of one of the few remaining Apaches rendered further attack air support no longer effective. Reinforcements hovering outside the objective area could no longer be safely inserted due to intense ground fire, and supply drops for friendly positions were likely to be shot down. Given the unarmored nature of the CH-47s and UH-60s, the ground force commander ordered the supporting aircraft to return to Bagram Air Base.Billingsley, D. (2002).

Headquartered out of Bagram Airbase, the brigade task force provided a wide range of aviation support to CJTF-101, CJTF-82, CJSOTF, USFOR-A and International Security and Assistance Forces (ISAF). The 159th Combat Aviation Brigade reorganized as Task Force Thunder, and as the only U.S. Aviation Brigade operating in Afghanistan at the time assumed responsibility for an area the size of Texas. Due to the decentralized nature of the fight, the limited aviation assets in theater, and the vast geographic expanse requiring helicopter support, the Brigade established four distinct multi-functional task forces based out of Bagram, Jalalabad, Salerno, and Kandahar Airfield, with follow on establishment at FOB Shank. The joint, coalition based task force included 138 helicopters, 7 un-manned aerial systems (UAVs), and 28 various fixed wing aircraft with an oversight relationship for Polish, French and Czech Aviation units. In 2009, the Brigade Task Force provided both direct and general support, full spectrum aviation operations, to all regional commands operating in Afghanistan. Since assuming the mission, Task Force Thunder flew over 136,000 flight hours, conducted over 509 deliberate air assaults and executed over 3,700 air movement operations. These operations resulted in moving over 132,000 Soldiers and 6,574 Tons of cargo. In addition, the unit executed more than 2,400 MEDEVAC missions, moving over 2,800 patients from point of injury to appropriate care facilitieshttps://web.archive.org/web/20110824002803/http://www.campbell.army.mil/units/101st/159th/Pages/Welcome.aspx FOB Blessing A CH-47 hovering over the HLZ at FOB Blessing FOB Blessing and COP Vegas were located within the Korengal Valley, in Eastern Afghanistan. In September 2009, a flight of two CH-47s transferring troops and equipment from FOB Blessing to COP Vegas was ambushed by insurgents. During the second approach into COP Vegas, a CH-47 was struck in tail ramp by a rocket-propelled grenade. The aircraft hydraulics were significantly damaged, and the CH-47 pitched violently while the crew fought to regain control. The pilot made the decision to attempt to fly the severely damaged airframe back to FOB Blessing, where there would be sufficient landing space for a MEDEVAC aircraft to land and evacuate the numerous wounded on board.http://www.fortcampbellcourier.com/news/article_077eceb4-c1d6-11df-9431-001cc4c03286.html Upon arrival to FOB Blessing, the pilot judged the risk of landing on the established HLZ to be too high, instead landing the aircraft in an open field to conserve the HLZ for an inbound MEDEVAC. This likely saved the lives of several of the wounded Soldiers on board, as otherwise medical crews would have been forced to spend time improvising an HLZ or even remove casualties individually from the air. After conducting an emergency shut-down, the crew found damage to the CH-47's hydraulic control lines which could have been catastrophic. The aircrew and ground forces at FOP Blessing became nervous that insurgents would launch a mortar attack on the vulnerable airframe at first light, in an attempt to set the aviation fuel inside ablaze. Fortunately, the crew was able to self-repair the damage to the hydraulics, then limped back to Bagram Airbase, an hour and a half long harrowing flight.http://www.fortcampbellcourier.com/news/article_077eceb4-c1d6-11df-9431-001cc4c03286.html As a result of his heroism, 7-101 CH-47 pilot CW3 Ryan Dechent was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.http://www.fortcampbellcourier.com/news/article_077eceb4-c1d6-11df-9431-001cc4c03286.html COP Keating 159th CAB Aviators from Task Force Pale Horse (7-17 Cavalry) provided direct air support to the ground troops during the attack on COP Keating on 3 October 2009. COP Keating was located in a depression, surrounded by mountains. Because of the extremely small size of the one- hundred meter outpost, the landing zone was located 'outside the wire' - a common expression for being outside the defensive perimeter in an unsecure area. The landing zone had only enough room for one Chinook or two Blackhawks to land at one time.https://www.facebook.com/notes/159th-combat-aviation- brigade/servicemembers-receive-air-medals-with-valor/154356551259751 This would greatly complicate support and reinforcement efforts before, during, and after the Battle of Kamdesh. Observation Post Fritsche was located on top of a nearby mountain, overlooking COP Keating and a significant liability were it overrun. The Blackhawks quickly left accompanied by two Apaches, with a load of approximately thirty infantry to fortify OP Fritsche. Upon arriving at the site, the Blackhawks began receiving heavy ground fire from what would later be assessed as a 300-strong element of enemy fighters. More troublingly, OP Fritsche could offer no support to neighboring COP Keating as the force was cut off by heavy enemy machine gun and RPG fire from within the valley. This constituted a problem for the helicopter teams since the regular avenue of approach to COP Keating was through the low-lying terrain of said valley.http://www.fortcampbellcourier.com/news/article_b924a39e-95d7-11df-8ec7-001cc4c002e0.html Image of COP Keating showing small size of the Helicopter Landing Zone (HLZ) and proximity to occupied buildings. In an attempt to conceal their approach, the aircraft took a non-traditional approach by flying directly over the mountain ridge. After multiple turns in the area while under fire, the two Blackhawks were able to insert more than 100 Soldiers to reinforce the outpost.https://www.facebook.com/notes/159th-combat-aviation- brigade/servicemembers-receive-air-medals-with-valor/154356551259751 Meanwhile, the Apaches remained overhead providing support to the battered U.S. force at COP Keating. The Apache crews had been verbally told that the COP was taking heavy fire from small arms and RPGs prior to departure, however the situation was unstable and the Apache crews were worried of accidentally firing upon friendly troops. Via radio contact with the ground force within COP Keating, the crews were told to consider anyone outside the wire perimeter to be hostile. As a result, the attack aircraft engaged some thirty armed individuals just outside a large visible breach in the defensive works of COP Keating.http://www.fortcampbellcourier.com/news/article_b924a39e-95d7-11df-8ec7-001cc4c002e0.html Just after this time MEDEVAC aircraft attempted to extract wounded, but were forced to turn back due to heavy ground fire. The Apaches remained on-station for approximately 90 minutes taking repeated damage from small arms fire and eventually running out of ammunition.http://www.fortcampbellcourier.com/news/article_b924a39e-95d7-11df-8ec7-001cc4c002e0.html As a result of small arms damage, the Apache crews were forced to switch aircraft upon returning to FOB Bostick rather than simply rearming and refueling. This had the fortunate side-effect of allowing the crews several minutes to return to the nearby unit TOC, exchange maps and information of the situation, and learn of the most recent real-time intelligence regarding events on the ground. The Apaches returned to COP Keating and began engaging a mixed group of 25 enemy fighters in and around the nearby police station and mosque. Overcast weather from an incoming thunder storm allowed the pilots to clearly see muzzle flashes from small arms and DShK heavy machine guns directed at them and friendly ground forces. The impending thunderstorm was both a blessing and a curse, as the Apaches were forced again to return to FOB Bostick due to severe weather. After approximately a one-hour weather hold, 159th CAB aircraft returned to the area one final time that day to further support ground forces with Apache fire and conduct one further reinforcement of OP Fritsche.http://www.fortcampbellcourier.com/news/article_b924a39e-95d7-11df-8ec7-001cc4c002e0.html As a result of heroism in the face of enemy fire, 3-101 Apache pilots Captain Matthew J.

The entire brigade, minus its MEDEVAC company that had just returned from an off-cycle deployment to Iraq and Afghanistan, assumed responsibility for the rotary wing aviation mission throughout Regional Command South in Afghanistan. Throughout its year-long deployment, the brigade provided full-spectrum aviation support to ground units, to include air assaults, air movements, reconnaissance, security, close combat attack and Pathfinder missions. During the deployment, Task Force Thunder made history when it became the first CAB to receive, integrate, and execute fixed-wing movements with Alenia C-27J Spartans and electronic attack missions with Beechcraft C-12 Caesar aircraft. The 159th CAB also took on a new role during this deployment, serving as mentors to Afghan National Security Forces. Partnerships with the Afghan Air Force, Afghan National Police, Afghan National Civil Order of Police, and the Afghan National Army helped to further improve security in the region and increase the capability of the ANSF and the government of Afghanistan. The majority of the 101st Airborne Division redeployed from Afghanistan by late 2011. On 22 March 2012 the 159th Combat Aviation Brigade redeployed to Fort Campbell, Kentucky and, for the first time in five years, the entire 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) was \\"back home\\" together. Medevac support As Task Force Thunder, the 159th CAB was responsible for medical evacuation flights for all of RC-S and RC-SW in partnership with the U.S. Air Force. TF Thunder Medevac flights were based out of Kandahar Airfield, Camp Bastion, and several small combat outposts in Helmand, Uruzgun, and Zabul provinces. Grape Rows common in Arghandab and Helmand River Valleys During the summer of 2011, TF Thunder partnered with Task Force Strike (2nd Brigade, 101st Airborne Division) and later Task Force Mountain (10th Mountain Division), and TF Thunder Medevac aircraft were repeatedly engaged at ranges of 100 meters or less by small arms and rocket propelled grenade fire in the claustrophobic Arghandab River and Helmand River valleys. The unique terrain in this region consisted of open wheat or poppy fields which could be used as a landing zone, and built-up grape rows which could not. The geographic situation limited Medevac pilots to a relative few landing sites, allowing for repeated ambush.http://www.stripes.com/news/special- reports/heroes/heroes-2012/you-ve-got-to-do-everything-you-can-to-get-the- wounded-off-the-battlefield-1.179220 TF Thunder Medevac crews learned to cooperate closely with infantry ground forces to establish a tight security perimeter around a given HLZ.

The church is located in Sioux City, Iowa, United States. The church building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. History The first Episcopalian Church service in Sioux City was conducted by a missionary from Council Bluffs, Iowa in 1857. St. Thomas Church was established two years later. A small frame church was built for the congregation on the corner of Nebraska and 7th Streets in 1860 for $1,550. By 1881 it became necessary to add onto the church, and a rectory was built at the same time. A pipe organ was purchased for the same price that the original church was built. The cornerstone for the present church was laid in 1891. The church was designed in the Romanesque Revival style by local architect James W. Martin. John M. Poorbaugh was the contractor. It is considered an excellent example of the Richardsonian Romanesque mode. with The building was completed in 1892 and cost about $80,000 to build. The stained glass windows from the old church were removed before the building was torn down. They were donated in 1893 to Trinity Memorial Episcopal Church in Mapleton, Iowa and were placed in their new church built in 1896. A new pipe organ was purchased in 1909 and the Weare Chapel was added at the same time. In 1922 a fire from an overheated furnace caused extensive damage to the church. The building had to be rebuilt and a new organ was purchased. The church was redecorated again in 1951. In the early 1960s, the Parish House was built and the parish acquired a new rectory. Weare Chapel was restored in 1980 under the direction of Howard Tervillian, who was Architect in Residence for the Washington National Cathedral, in Washington, D.C. Another renovation of the church occurred in 1982. Architecture The structure is generally rectangular in plan. It is influenced by a later phase of Henry Hobson Richardson's design evolution in its more simplified cubic form. Its exterior is clad in rose-colored Sioux Quartzite was laid using in a broken ashlar technique. The broad slate cruciform roof-plan gives the building a monumental feel.

Though altered and transformed since its original construction, the most part of its foundations and of the first floor walls date back to the vicinity of 1650, making it one of the oldest houses, if not the oldest house in Quebec City. In 1759, the Articles of Capitulation of Quebec were signed within the house. The present edifice has remained largely unchanged since 1819. It served as the French Consulate from 1980 to 2015. Occupants during the French Regime (1650‚Äì1763) The first owners of the land on which Kent House stands were Louis d'Ailleboust de Coulonge, 4th Governor of New France from 1648 to 1651, and his wife, Marie-Barbe de Boulogne. Shortly after 1650, they had a house built on this site. Following the death of the late governor's wife in 1665, her property and house on Saint-Louis Street was gifted to the H√¥tel-Dieu de Qu√©bec. On May 27, 1671, the Ladies of the H√¥tel-Dieu sold the property to Louis-Th√©andre Chartier de Lotbini√®re, Lieutenant-General of the Civil and Criminal Courts at Quebec, who at once took up residence there. In 1679, he left for his mother country, never to return to New France, but his widow continued to live there, dying there in 1690. Their son, Ren√©-Louis Chartier de Lotbini√®re, Chief Councillor of the Sovereign Council of New France, lived there from 1679 until his death on June 4, 1709. All of his children were born there (the first cousins of the last Governor General of New France, Pierre de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil), and after his death they became the joint owners of the property, with the exception of a portion on the east side, which was sold by their father to Madame Vitre in 1674. Ren√©-Louis's fourth child, Eustache Chartier de Lotbini√®re, the first Canadian Dean of Notre-Dame de Qu√©bec Cathedral, lived there from 1709 until 1713, until it was agreed to be sold by his brothers and sisters. The Lotbini√®re house (as it had come to be known) and its dependencies were sold by voluntary decree for 10,000 livres on March 14, 1713, to Jean-Baptiste Maillou, architect and contractor to the King of France at Quebec. The minutes of this sale contain an exact description of the property situated between St. Louis and Mount Carmel streets, and the house, which was said to be: of masonry erected thereon, measuring about fifty feet in length by thirty in width, consisting oftwo stories, one being the mansard, in which there are four rooms with fire places, a kitchen, two large rooms and two smaller ones, with storerooms underneath and in the attic above, covered with shingles; in front of which house there is vacant ground in which there is a well, also in masonry, and in the rear of the said house are gardens, in which there are a number of fruit trees and an ice house On Maillou's death in 1753, the house was left to his son, Vital Maillou, who did not live in it but leased it for three years to Michel Chartier de Lotbini√®re, Marquis de Lotbini√®re, the son of the previous resident, Eustache Chartier de Lotbini√®re. The future Marquis de Lotbini√®re lived there with his wife, the fourth generation of his family to live there. On June 1, 1758, the house was bought from Maillou by Jean-Baptiste Nicolas Roch de Ramezay, son of Governor Claude de Ramezay and a nephew of Eustache Chartier de Lotbini√®re's sister, Marie- Louise Denys de la Ronde. De Ramezay had grown up in Montreal at Ch√¢teau Ramezay, built by his father, and had just been promoted King's Lieutenant at Quebec. Following the Battle of the Plains of Abraham, it was de Ramezay who signed the Articles of Capitulation of Quebec before Governor-General James Murray at the house, September 18, 1759. It was the only convenient place at hand which had not suffered from the bombardment of General James Wolfe's artillery. Ownership following the Capitulation of New France (1763-1791) Following the British Conquest of New France, de Ramezay maintained ownership of the property until with his permission his wife sold it on August 23, 1763, to John Bondfield, the Quebec merchant who only the following year was forced to flee Canada with his brother, Achlam, because of \\"an open avowal of the American measures\\". On August 4, 1764, Bondfield sold the house to London merchant James Strachan, acting for himself and for the London House of Greenwood & Higginson. Strachan sold the property on October 24, 1777, to Hon. Adam Mabane, one of the members of the Executive Council of Quebec under Governor Murray, and Judge of the Quebec Court of Common Pleas. The deed of sale describes the house as of two stories, including the ground story from the St. Louis street side, the entry to which was by a flight of stairs, as exists to-day. It was also stipulated in the deed to leave a free passage of eight feet along the gable of the next house. Residence to the Duke of Kent and Madame de St. Laurent (1791-1802) Madame de Saint-Laurent- Mistress of Prince Edward Montmorency House next to the Montmorency Falls around 1900. On the formation of Lower Canada, in August, 1791, Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn arrived in Quebec City and shortly afterwards leased Judge Mabane's house for ¬£90 per annum. He lived there for three happy years with his beautiful mistress, Madame de Saint Laurent, before he was posted to Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1794. Though he did not return to house, he continued to lease it until his departure from Canada in 1802 to take up his new position as Governor of Gibraltar. In his memoirs, Pierre-Ignace Aubert de Gasp√© (father of the author of Les Anciens Canadiens), speaks several times of dinners given by the Duke and his mistress at \\"his fine residence\\" on Saint- Louis Street, but the Duke preferred his summer home, Montmorency House, seven miles away, next to the Montmorency Falls. The Duke's mistress with whom he shared the house in Quebec was Madame Alphonsine-Therese-Bernardine-Julie de Montgenet de St. Laurent, the wife of Baron de Fortisson, a colonel in the French service. While in Geneva, the Duke had been introduced to the de Fortissons and soon after Julie and Edward became lovers. The Dukes's father, King George III, enrolled Edward in the army and had him posted to Gibraltar, where Edward made arrangements for her to be smuggled so they could be together. George III later found out about the affair and so sent the Duke to Quebec City as colonel of the 7th Fusiliers. Humiliated, at first he refused to go, but in August 1791 he arrived accompanied by his chatelaine, introduced as Julie de St. Laurent and reputed to be a widow. It has been claimed by several writers that the Baroness was morganatically allied to the Duke of Kent at a Roman Catholic church in Quebec. For twenty-eight years Madame de St. Laurent presided over the Duke's household, as a local chronicler records, \\"with dignity and propriety.\\" She is described as having been beautiful, clever, witty and accomplished. Many of her letters will be found in Anderson's \\" Life of the Duke of Kent \\" (Quebec: 1870). After the Duke's marriage in 1818 to the widow of the Prince of Leiningen, Madame de St. Laurent retired to a convent in Paris. She later married a Russian-Italian nobleman and eventually settled back in the Quebec City area at the summer home (built by Governor-General Sir Frederick Haldimand) she had shared with the Duke, which also still stands today. Occupants from 1802 to the present day Judge Mabane died in 1792, his death being attributed to a cold he contracted while walking into town in a snowstorm, having lost his way on the Plains of Abraham. The property was sold by the Sheriff and adjudged to Miss Isabella Mabane, a sister of the judge, for the sum of ¬£700. Following the departure of Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn from Canada in 1802, Miss Mabane leased the house to the Rt. Rev. Jacob Mountain, the first Anglican Bishop of Quebec. In 1809, for the sum of ¬£1,300, Miss Mabane sold the property to her relative, Hon. John Craigie, a member of His Majesty's Executive Council of Quebec. In 1816, Craigie sold it on for ¬£3,000 to Pierre Brehaut, but he was not able to enjoy the property, dying the following year. His widow, Theresa Bellamy, sold it on to The Hon. Judge Olivier Perrault in 1819, who enlarged and extended the property into two houses. According to the deed of sale, the building still retained its ancient appearance and the space from the west gable of about eighteen feet, to Haldimand Street, was vacant ground. The house has retained its present exterior appearance since at least 1819. After Judge Perrault's death in 1827, the property passed to his son-in- law, Hon. Elz√©ar-Henri Juchereau Duchesnay. Over the next hundred years, the property changed hands on many occasions, being owned in turn by John Jones; Dame Amelie Duchesnay, wife of Alexander Lindsay; an hotel keeper named O'Neil; Hon. Thomas McGreevy, Hon. Jean Thomas Taschereau and finally Joseph A. Gale. In 1907, Gale gave the house a complete renovation, though keeping the walls and divisions intact. In 1927, he sold it to the brothers William Evan Price and David Edward Price of Quebec, who planned to level the property and replace it with a modern office structure for the firm of Price Brothers & Co. The plan was averted, and Price Brothers Building was forced further out of the city centre, but still within Old Quebec, which met with further remonstrations from the residents of Quebec. The history of the house from 1927 to the present day is neglected. Today it serves as the French Consulate at Quebec.

Anderson commissioned multiple works of art to adorn a variety of public spaces in the City of St. Augustine, including the two Medici lion statues placed at the approach to the famed Bridge of Lions. Anderson was the son of New York physician Dr. Andrew Anderson I, an 1813 graduate of the New York College of Physicians and Surgeons. His father arrived in St. Augustine in 1829 aboard the schooner General Jackson, along with his mother Mary and two sisters Hannah and Emily. Within a few years the elder Anderson had become a pillar of the community. In 1830 he was elected head of the local temperance society, St. Augustine alderman in 1833 and 1834, a justice of the peace and an elder of the Presbyterian Church in 1839. The elder Anderson's first wife Mary Anderson died on September 8, 1837. In 1838 he married Clarissa Cochrane Fairbanks a widow from New Hampshire. Their son Andrew Anderson II was born in 1839. In the same year his father laid the cornerstone for what would eventually become the Markland Mansion on the plantation he owned on land between the San Sebastian River and Maria Sanchez Creek. Soon after beginning construction on Markland his father perished in a yellow fever outbreak which had struck St. Augustine. Education - post-Civil War Marble lion, one of a pair commissioned by Dr. Andrew Anderson for Bridge of Lions Anderson and his family moved into a scaled back version of Markland in 1841. After attending receiving his preliminary schooling in St. Augustine, Anderson attended the Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts between 1853 - 1854 then switched to a private school in Paris, France. Upon returning to the United States he entered Princeton University, then during the Civil War he escaped from Florida and went to New York City, where he entered medical school at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City. He didn't serve in the military in the American Civil War, but did pay for a substitute in the St. Augustine Blues (Third Florida Inf., Co. B) as was accepted custom at the time. He also volunteered his services to the Union as a physician treating the wounded at the Second Battle of Fredericksburg. In 1865, after the South's capitulation he interned at St. Luke's Hospital in New York City. After returning to St. Augustine, Anderson immersed himself in the civic affairs of the city including sitting on the board that created the Peabody Free School, the local Republican Party Secretary, alderman on the St. Augustine City Council and St. Johns County Commissioner as well as serving in the board of the Buckingham Smith Benevolent Association. In 1886, he was elected mayor of St. Augustine. Anderson would be a principal partner along with Frank H. Palmer and Edward E. Vaill in the construction of the St. Augustine Hotel, the most opulent hotel in the city before the construction of the San Marco Hotel. In 1880 he entertained President Ulysses S. Grant, whose sister Julia was married to the post commander of St. Francis Barracks, upon Grant's visit to St. Augustine.St. Augustine and St. Johns County: A Historical Guide By William R. Adams p. 60 Henry Flagler In 1885, Anderson sold his land east of Markland to Henry Flagler as was the land of Anderson's two half-sisters for the construction of two hotels, the Ponce de Le√≥n Hotel and the Alcazar Hotel. For a period of time Anderson (who had rented out Markland after his mother's death in 1881) lived in a third Flagler hotel, the Cordova, which Flagler purchased from Franklin W. Smith. During this time he maintained a small medical practice at the Alcazar. Alica Hospital In May 1888, the St. Augustine Hospital Association to oversee Alicia Hospital located on Marine Street in a building deeded to the association by Henry Flagler. Anderson worked at the hospital as a physician, and served as chairman of the board of trustees. He remained a trustee until his death. Personal Anderson married Mary Elizabeth Smethurst, a woman 24 years his junior, at Trinity Episcopal Church, St. Augustine on January 29, 1895. The best man was his cousin William Harriman of New York, and Henry Flagler attended the wedding with his wife. Anderson also invited a large number of African-Americans, which went against the social customs of the time. The Andersons had two children, Clarissa and Andrew. They hired New Jersey architect Charles Alling Gifford to vastly enlarge and remodel Markland, 1899-1901. Mrs. Anderson died in Nova Scotia on September 12, 1912, in Chester, Nova Scotia where they owned a vacation home.

The film was produced by Edward Black, with cinematography from Arthur Crabtree and screenplay by Rodney Ackland and Terence Rattigan from a novel by Oscar Millard. Uncensored is set in occupied Belgium and shares the propagandistic tone of many British films of its era. While its reception was mainly positive, it was criticised in some quarters for its unrealistic portrayal of the occupying German forces as bungling, incompetent and easily outwitted buffoons. On its original UK release Uncensored ran for 108 minutes; for overseas distribution however it was trimmed to 83 minutes and the cut version subsequently became more widely circulated. Plot Before the Nazi occupation of Belgium, Brussels nightclub owner Andr√© Delange (Portman) used to publish an anti-Nazi newspaper called La Libre Belgique (Free Belgium) which was distributed secretly. In the aftermath of the German occupation, his underground colleagues in the Belgian resistance suggest reviving the newspaper, to which Delange agrees. With the help of his chief assistant Julie Lanvin (Calvert) and a small band of helpers, La Libre Belgique once more begins to circulate. When the Germans find out of its existence, they offer a reward to anyone who is prepared to identify those responsible for its publication. Delange's business partner Charles Neels (Peter Glenville), disgruntled with their business relationship and jealous of Delange's relationship with the attractive Julie, betrays the whereabouts of the newspaper's makeshift office. The premises are raided and those present in the building arrested, but Delange and Julie manage to avoid capture. The Germans announce to the populace that La Libre Belgique is no more and its perpetrators are in custody; however Delange and Julie succeed in printing and distributing another edition, making the Germans look foolish and leading them to assume that the information given to them by their informant was false. They release those arrested, who they now believe not to be the people they were looking for, and vow to continue searching for the real culprits. Meanwhile the group led by Delange comes together again, and their work continues.

It is a story about the problems of growing up, puberty, envy and jealousy, friendship and love. The novel was nominated for the Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis. The book has been translated into English by Alisa Jaffa and was edited by Jonas Sachwitz. It was published in the UK under the title Centre of My World.  Contents  Phil is seventeen years old, has a twin sister (Dianne), a best friend (Kat), a slightly crazy mother (Glass) with constantly changing male relationships and is in love ‚Äì with Nicholas. The story does not primarily treat Phil's homosexuality, but rather stresses the difficulties he has to cope with in everyday life. With his mother and his sister, Phil lives in a huge mansion called 'Visible' which is located slightly remote from their city. The city's inhabitants barely have contact with this weird family. The main exception to this is Phil's best friend Kat, the daughter of their school's principal, who repeatedly violates her parents' interdiction of visiting Phil. Another important person is the lawyer Tereza, who is friends with the family and acts as a kind of mentor to Phil. The story depicts the past of the family through emotional anecdotes, particularly through stories about the no longer existent father, an uncle as a compensating father figure and childhood memories of Phil and Dianne. Episodes in the presence deal with Phil's love for Nicholas, conversations with his mentor and disputes between his sister and his mother. The story is written in the first-person perspective.  Reception  In the nationwide German newspaper Die Zeit, Konrad Heidkamp praised Steinh√∂fel for excelling himself: \\"The flashbacks from the children's point of view that allow room for Steinh√∂fel's deadpan humor, and the romantic fairytales - from the pond via the black wooden doll to the castle with royal children -, combined with the young literate author's smart way of introducing these two layers into the storyline, make this a book on the tenderness of reading and the risk inherent to strong feelings.\\"Konrad Heidkamp: Luchs 136: Andreas Steinh√∂fels Jugendroman ‚ÄûDie Mitte der Welt‚Äú.

He was subsequently a member of the Brighton Improvement Commissioners. Kemp had established his own non-conformist sect, and Faithfull was a regular preacher in the chapel in Ship Street, Brighton. When Kemp returned to the Church of England in 1823, Faithfull became minister of the Ship Street Chapel (later called Holy Trinity Church, in 1827 replacing it with a new building in Church Street. Following the Reform Act 1832, Brighton was enfranchised as a parliamentary borough, returning two members of parliament to the House of Commons. At the 1832 general election Faithfull was elected as one of the town's first MPs alongside Isaac Wigney. His extreme Radical views were not popular with his constituents, however. The diarist Charles Greville, a resident of Brighton, described him as a \\"bad character\\". He was defeated at the next general election in 1835. Faithfull put his defeat down to lack of support from the press, and accordingly began publication of the weekly Brighton Patriot and Lewes Free Press in February 1835 to propagate his views. He was once again defeated in an ill-tempered general election in 1837. The middle class readership abandoned Faithfull's newspaper and he found himself aligned with the local Chartists. When a series of Chartist riots and strikes took place in 1839, Faithfull closed the Patriot. He continued his legal practice until his death, acting as solicitors to a number of railway companies.Railway Times, Volume 2 (1839), p.88. He died at his Brighton residence in March 1863.

SL 139 was one of the SL convoys from the South Atlantic to Britain, and MKS 30 one of the MKS convoys between Britain and the Mediterranean. They were sailing together on the Gibraltar homeward route, having made a rendezvous off Gibraltar in November 1943. They were the subject of a major U-boat attack, as part of the Kriegsmarines renewed Autumn offensive. Background Following the renewal of the U-boat offensive in the Atlantic, convoys on the UK/Gibraltar routes, had again come under attack. German U-boat Control (BdU) had established a patrol line off the coast of Portugal, which had already attacked Allied convoys in October, leading to an inconclusive clash over Convoy SL 138/MKS 28. In order to maximize the protection for convoys on this route the Admiralty and begun to run these in tandem, bringing together the South Atlantic and the Mediterranean routes at Gibraltar. Protagonists SL 139 left Freetown on 2 November 1943, arriving off Gibraltar on 16 November. It comprised 42 ships and was escorted by an Escort Group, of nine warships. MKS 30 sailed from Port Said on 2 November, similarly arriving off Gibraltar on 16 November to meet SL 139. The combined body of 66 ships then sailed for Britain. It was escorted by 40 Escort Group, of seven warships, led by (Cdr. JS Dalison). The Schill patrol group, which had been active in this area since October, was now organized into three patrol lines west of Portugal, while aircraft of the Luftwaffe from searched the ocean for any sign of the approaching convoys. The first, Schill 1, of seven U-boats, was the southernmost rake, running in a line to the west of Lisbon. The second, Schill 2, of ten U-boats, was aligned west of Cape Finisterre in Spain, while the third, Schill 3, of twelve U-boats, was north of this, roughly along the 45 parallel. Action The two convoys made their rendezvous on noon on 16 November 1943, a total of 66 ships initially escorted by 40 EG, seven warships led by Exe. The combined convoys were sighted by German aircraft on late afternoon of 16 November, southwest of Cape St Vincent, but were able to evade the shadow during the night. On 18 November the convoys encountered Schill 1's patrol line. They were sighted by , which was joined by two other boats (, ) for the first assault. Also on the 18th the escort force was joined by 7 EG, a Support Group of five warships led by , (Cdr LF Durnford-Slater). Meanwhile, further north, of Schill 2 was caught by an RAF Wellington. She was depth-charged and sunk.,Kemp p158 During the night of 18/19 November, in a series of forays the U-boats tried to penetrate the escort screen, but without success. U-333 was attacked by Exe; she was damaged when she was rammed by Exe and was forced to return to base. Meanwhile, U-515 had attacked and damaged the sloop ; she was forced to drop out, to be towed to the Allied Base in the Azores. Chanticleer survived the .. day journey, and was beached, but was declared unrecoverable. was counter-attacked, and also forced to retire with damage, leaving U-262 to shadow until Schill 2 could engage. On 19 November the convoys joined by 5 EG, a Canadian group of six warships led by British frigate (Cdr JD Birch) operating in a Support Group role. Later on the 19th the convoys were also joined by destroyers Winchelsea and Wrestler, bringing the total escort strength up to nineteen warships. At dusk on 19 November the convoys encountered Schill 2, which commenced an assault throughout the night of 19/20 November. Again, they were unable to penetrate the escort screen and during the night was destroyed by Nene and Snowberry,Kemp p158 Canada's first Support group success. On 20 November the boats of Schill 2 remained in contact. They were reduced to a shadowing role and came under air attack by patrolling aircraft, but in a series of gun duels two aircraft were shot down, a Liberator of 53 Sqdn by and an RCAF Sunderland of 422 Sqdn by . None of the U-boats were lost or damaged by air attack, but was caught by Foley and Crane and destroyed.,Kemp p159 That night 20/21 November the convoy and pursuing U-boats reached the boats of Schill 3 which joined the fray. Again all attacks were unsuccessful, though no U-boats were destroyed. On 21 November the convoy was joined by another Support group, 4 EG, comprising six warships led by Bentinck (Cdr EH Chavasse), and by Prince Robert an RCN Armed Merchant Cruiser, fitted out as an AA gunship. During 21 November BdU called off the U-boat assault, but the convoy was now in range of strike aircraft based in Occupied France. On the afternoon of 21 November the Luftwaffe launched an attack using its new weapon, the Hs 293 guided missile. Twenty-five He 177's each carrying two Hs 293s took off to attack SL 139/MKS 30. At a distance of several miles the drones were released, to be guided by radio control to their target. Despite AA fire from the escorts, particularly Prince Robert, two ships were hit: Marsa was sunk, Delius, damaged. During this assault two aircraft were forced to return with mechanical trouble, and three others failed to return. This was the only attempt on the convoy by the Luftwaffe; the convoy continued its voyage without further incident, docking at Liverpool on 26 November 1943. Aftermath Despite the concentration of U-boats for this attack, the U-boat Arm failed to make any impact on the convoy. No merchant ships were sunk by the U-boats, though one escort was damaged and subsequently written off, while three U-boats were destroyed. The Luftwaffe similarly had a disappointing result. Despite their new weapon, of which great things were expected, they saw only one ship sunk and one damaged, for the loss of three aircraft. For the Allies, their confidence in their ability to protect convoys and destroy attacking U-boats continued, and this was further vindication of the Support Group policy, with no less than three Support Groups able to throw their weight into the conflict.

It is native to Eurasia and North Africa, but it can be found throughout much of the temperate world as a common roadside weed. Description Silene gallica is an erect or semi-erect annual herb growing up to tall, its branching stem clad in long, curling hairs and shorter, glandular hairs. The opposite, entire, lance-shaped leaves have acute apexes, are up to long on the lower parts of the plant, and smaller on the upper parts. The flowers grow in a terminal inflorescence at the top of the stem, and some appear in the leaf axils. Each flower has a tubular calyx of fused sepals lined with ten green or purple-red veins. The calyx is coated in long, sometimes glandular, hairs and becomes inflated in fruit. There are five white, pink or bicolored, spatulate petals, each with a small appendage at the base. There are ten stamens and three styles. The fruit is a brown, ovoid capsule with six apical teeth. Distribution and habitat Native to Europe, this species has a submediterranean / subatlantic distribution. In the British Isles it mostly occurs near the coast of England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland, but also sporadically inland. It is found in sandy or gravelly, often acidic, soils in arable fields, on wasteland and on walls, as well as poor dry pastures on the coast, and on sand dunes in the Channel Islands. Status This plant has been in long-term decline, especially in the more northern parts of Europe, and is no longer present in many inland sites in Britain and Ireland, with a population reduction of 80% in the last ten years reported in 2006. This may be due to changes in agriculture practices, or it may perhaps be affected by climate change.

It was written by Bryan Elsley and directed by Paul Gay., Tony's episode at e4.com/skins It is told from the point of view of main character Tony Stonem. It aired on E4 on 25 January 2007., www.imdb.com  Plot  The episode begins with Tony waking up in his room on an average morning. He distracts his angry, overly vocal father in order for his younger sister Effy to get inside unnoticed. He also stares at a naked woman changing in front of her bedroom window across the street. Tony continues to irritate his father by locking him out of the bathroom and exiting through the window, leaving the door locked. Tony's father swears a great deal, seemingly constantly much to their mother Anthea's annoyance. Tony then leaves for college and on the way rings his friends and tries to organise a night out so they can help his best friend Sid lose his virginity. Tony and Sid meet for breakfast in a caf√© where Tony tells Sid that they will get a girl \\"spliffed up\\" so she will have sex with Sid. Sid assumes he will get to have sex with Tony's girlfriend, the beautiful Michelle and it is revealed that Sid is very attracted to her. Michelle and Tony tell Sid he is being set up with Cassie who was recently in hospital and is good in bed provided she isn't hungry, according to \\"everyone\\". Tony asks Sid to pick up some drugs off his dealer, Mad Twatter. Tony auditions for the city chamber choir and succeeds in getting a part. He then flirts with a private school girl Abigail Stock and agrees to attend her house party with his friends. Most of his friends, however, have other plans. Tony's gay friend Maxxie is taking Chris and Anwar on a big, gay night out. Tony, now aware via Chris that Bristol (the show's setting) is awash with cannabis, tries to call Sid to 'abort the mission' by telling him not to buy the drugs, but Sid has his mobile phone switched off. Sid asks Mad about buying drugs on credit terms, but is bullied into purchasing three ounces instead of the intended ounce by the deranged, moustached drug dealer. He warns Sid that if he has not paid him the three hundred pounds within the time given, he will take Sid's testicles as \\"collateral\\". The gang arrive at Abigail's party and Sid meets Cassie, who tells him he is cute, and is delighted that he won't make her eat anything. In Abigail's house, they are told to remove their shoes in order to prevent staining the brand new carpet imported from Iran. They also cannot smoke anything in the house on account of the expensive wallpaper. Tony and Michelle scoff at the dull lifeless party the wealthy \\"posh\\" kids are enjoying and decide to show them up with seductive dancing. Sid goes to find Cassie, and they discuss her anorexia. While they talk, Chris, Anwar and Maxxie arrive, having found Bristol's gay scene dull. While Chris dirties the floor with his shoes, the posh kids gang up on the newcomers, and a fight begins after Tony punches a posh kid in the face. The fight is broken up as Sid runs in with an unconscious Cassie, who told him she had taken pills before passing out. The group, along with a posh Polish girl from the party, steal a Mercedes car and drive Cassie to the city hospital, where Cassie wakes, seemingly fine. The gang then drive to the harbour. While parked, Sid accidentally hits the car's handbrake while searching for skins in Tony's back pocket. The car rolls into the harbour, destroying the three ounces of spliff. The group, minus Chris and the Pole, climb out of the submerged car and walk home. Tony and Sid later retire to Tony's bed, with both of them depressed that Sid is still a virgin despite being sixteen, which Tony feels is embarrassing. Sid asks Tony if Chris and the Pole got out of the car at the hospital; Tony says that they did.

He reigned from 1680 to 1736. From 1712 to 1736, he also reigned the County of Hanau-M√ºnzenberg.  Childhood and Youth  Johann Reinhard III was the son of Johann Reinhard II of Hanau-Lichtenberg and Anna Magdalena, Countess Palatine of Zweibr√ºcken-Birkenfeld. He was baptized on 1 August 1665. He was educated together with his older brother Philipp Reinhard, initially in Strasbourg. In 1678, they moved to Babenhausen, where their mother lived at the time. In 1678, they started a Grand Tour to the Alsace, Switzerland and Geneva. In 1690, the travelled for a year in Savoy and Turin, in 1681 to Paris, in 1683 to the Netherlands, England and some French provinces. In early 1684, they were in Milan, from there they went to see the carnival in Venice, followed by a trip to Rome (with audiences with Pope Innocent XII and queen Christina of Sweden), then to Naples, Florence, Modena, Parma, and Mantua. In 1686, they visited the imperial court in Vienna and on the way back, they traveled to Bohemia and visited the Electoral Saxon court in Dresden.  Reigning Hanau  = Regency = Johann Reinhard III came to the throne of the county of Hanau- Lichtenberg on 24 May 1680 (Julian, i.e. 3 June 1680 Gregorian) at the age of 15, after his family had deposed his uncle Friedrich Casimir, because his financial escapades had ruined the county. As Johann Reinhard III was a minor, the county was ruled by his guardians: his mother and his uncle Christian II of Zweibr√ºcken-Birkenfeld. At the same time, Johann Reinhard III's older brother Philipp Reinhard came to the throne of Hanau-M√ºnzenberg. When this division was implemented, the district of Babenhausen was awarded to Hanau- M√ºnzenberg; this decision was confirmed in a treaty in 1691. In 1685, Johann Reinhard III was legally adopted by his deposed uncle Friedrich Casimir. In 1688, he came of age and took over the government. In 1691, duke Christian II filed his final report on the guardianship.  Policy  The economic situation in the county of Hanau-Lichtenberg was very bad, because the Upper Rhine valley, in which the county was situated, had been devastated during the War of the Palatinian Succession (1688‚Äì1697) and the War of Spanish Succession (1702‚Äì1713) and related military occupations. Johann Reinhard III tried to improve the situation. The political situation was also problematic: his predecessor had been forced to acknowledge French supremacy over the parts of the county located in Alsace. He could only rule those areas because he received \\"Letters Patent\\" to that effect from the French king Louis XIV in 1701 and 1707. Johann Reinhard III tried in vain to be raised to the rank of Imperial Prince. After it was clear that he would have no male heirs, he discontinued these efforts. When Philipp Reinhard died in 1712, Johann Reinhard III inherited Hanau-M√ºnzenberg. Under his rule, the two sub-counties were united in one hand for the last time. He alternated his residence between the two part of the county. He also succeeded his brother as director of the Wetterau Association of Imperial Counts. = Culture = Schloss Philippsruhe, Hanau Frankfurt Gate, west side During the reign of Johann Reinhard II, the County of Hanau prospered culturally: he began building a grand castle in Bischofsheim am hohen Steg (now called Rheinbischofsheim), which was never completed, and in the Hanau-Lichtenberg of Buchsweiler (now called Bouxwiller), he created a park and expanded the castle. Between 1730 and 1736 he rebuilt the Hanauer Hof (or H√¥tel de Hanau) in Strasbourg, which had been the city residence of the counts of Hanau-Lichtenberg since 1573. This building now serves as Strasbourg's city hall. After he took office in Hanau- M√ºnzenberg 1712, he completed the construction of the Schloss Philippsruhe, just outside the Hanau city gate, and the Philippsruhe Avenue, including the Heller bridge. He also created Chestnut Avenue and the Pheasant Park (at the later Wilhelmsbad) and completed construction of the stables of the city palace in Hanau (later Hanau's city hall; today the \\"Congress Park Hanau\\"), which Philipp Reinhard had started. Behind the city palace, the city wall was breached in order to obtain a direct access to the Turkish style gardens behind it. In 1727, he extended the St. John's Church in Hanau, in which the counts of Hanau were buried. He built Lutheran churches in Windecken, Steinau an der Stra√üe, Nauheim (now called: Bad Nauheim), Kesselstadt and Rodheim (the \\"Reinhard Church\\") and Lutheran schools in many towns in the county of Hanau- M√ºnzenberg. The reason for this was that Hanau-M√ºnzenberg has adopted Calvinism during the Reformation, but had been ruled since 1643 by the Lutheran counts of Hanau-Lichtenberg. By the early 18th century, the contrast between the two main Protestant variants had mitigated to the extent that this building policy was now acceptable for the Calvinist majority of the population. In his capital city of Hanau, street lighting was introduced. The Frankfurt Gate was torn down and rebuilt in a Baroque style, and the same was done to the Hanau's city hall. Personally, Count Johann Reinhard III lived rather modestly, which enabled him to finance his construction projects. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe reported, in his Dichtung und Wahrheit (Chapter 10) on a visit to Buchsweiler at the end of the 18th century: \\"Above all else, the name of the last Count, Reinhard of Hanau, was held in high esteem here and in the rest of this little country. His great intellect and ability in all his actions came to the fore, and many beautiful monument remain of his existence. Such men have the advantage of being double benefactors, for the present, which they delight, and also for the future, whose sense and courage they nurture and sustain.\\"  Inheritance  Once it became clear that there would be no male heir in Hanau, a dispute about the inheritance erupted. Basically there were two candidates: * Landgrave Ludwig IX of Hesse-Darmstadt, the son of Johann Reinhard III's daughter Charlotte (who had already died) and landgrave Ludwig VIII of Hesse-Darmstadt; * Landgrave Wilhelm VIII of Hesse- Kassel, who claimed the M√ºnzenberg part of the county, based on an inheritance treaty of 1643 between Hanau and the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel. In this situation, Count Johann Reinhard III tried to make his daughter and his grandson in Hesse-Darmstadt inherit as much of Hanau as possible. That was relatively easy for the Lichtenberg part of the country, to which the 1643 treaty did not apply. It took considerable financial effort in 1717, however, to include the passive fiefs of the Bishopric of Strasbourg and Archbishopric of Mainz into Ludwig's inheritance, because fiefs were usually only hereditary in the male line. For this payment, count Johann Reinhard III borrowed 100,000 florins from the Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel and pledged the Hanau district of Brandenstein as security for this loan. Anticipating the inheritance, Hesse- Kassel paid 600,000 taler to buy off claims by the Electorate of Saxony on the imperial fief held by Hanau-M√ºnzenberg. Saxony had acquired these claims from the emperor during the Thirty Years' War. Hesse-Kassel pledged the districts Frauensee, Landeck and Treffurt; Frauensee and Landeck were redeemed in 1743. Most problematic, however, was whether the district of Babenhausen belonged to the Lichtenberg or the M√ºnzenberg part of the inheritance. Here, too, Count Johann Reinhard III tried to strengthen the position of his daughter and grandson in Hesse-Darmstadt. In a will written in 1729, he bequeathed Babenhausen to Ludwig IX of Hesse-Darmstadt. On this issue, Hesse-Kassel initially appeared to be cooperative. Agreements were signed in 1714, 1718 and 1720. In 1730, however, Landgrave Friedrich I of Hesse-Kassel came to the throne and Hesse-Kassel's stance changed. On 17 April 1730, he sent the Hessian army to Hanau, to ensure his future inheritance. Count Johann Reinhard swore allegiance to Friedrich; this suspended the problem during his lifetime.  Death  Combined coats of arms of Johann Reinhard III of and Frederike Dorothea of Brandenburg-Ansbach, faience from Ansbach, probably made in 1724 on the occasion of their silver wedding Johann Reinhard III. died on 28 March 1736 in Schloss Philippsruhe in Hanau. On his deathbed, he was surrounded by the diplomatic and notarized representatives of his heirs.The student's song Alter Hanauer is said to be based on the circumstances of death of the Count, who was dying surrounded by the watchful representatives of his heirs He was buried in the family crypt in the St. Johann's Church in Hanau. The crypt was destroyed when Hanau was bombed during the Second World War. The question whether Babenhausen belonged to Hanau-Lichtenberg or Hanau-M√ºnzenberg was disputed for decades after his death. It was settled at the end of the 18th century by dividing the district.  Marriage and issue  Johann Reinhard III married on 20 or 30 August 1699 Countess Dorothea Friederike of Brandenburg- Ansbach (1676‚Äì1731). Her sister Caroline would later marry the British prince who became King George II. Johann Reinhard III and Frederike Dorothea had one daughter: Charlotte Christine Magdalene Johanna (1700‚Äì1726), who married Landgrave Louis VIII of Hesse-Darmstadt (1691‚Äì1768).

Presumably that was a temporary structure as in 1672 it was replaced by a nine-story tall building made out wood and rock of the late Renaissance style. The building as it planned was used for meeting of the city administration and court as a town hall. The rathaus was also used as an observation post. However, already in 1677, after the city withstood the Turkish siege it was simply disassembled. Some twenty years by the request of J√≥zef Potocki a building of new Ratusz was initiated. For that purpose the architect Karol Benoe was invited, who finished the project in 1695. According to Kowalczyk,Kowalczyk, J. Sebastiano Serlio a sztuka polska. Wroc≈Çaw, 1973. p.214 the architecture of that building was reminiscent with the style of Sebastiano Serlio. The new building was built after a similar Ratusz design in Husiatyn, only higher. In total the new building had nine floors. The Ratusz was topped with a small dome-type roof, on top of which was placed a sculptural ensemble of Archangel Michael who was defeating a serpent. In 1825 Archangel Michael was replaced with an eagle. On the level of a fifth floor on each of its tower four sides were placed clocks that every 15 minutes would engage a system of bells installed underneath the dome. The floor was encircled by an observation balcony. The second and third floors of the Ratusz were designated for the city administration while its first floor was leased for various trade shops (stores) which at some point accounted for up to 24. In the basement of the Ratusz was created a jail. There also was a single entrance from the western side through a gate upon which was placed a family coat of arms of Potocki. At the southern side was installed an iron statue of Jewish bread salesman with a sign \\"jeden grosz\\" to show how cheap bread is in the city. In 1801 the city's magistrate was evacuated from the building which was passed to the Austrian authorities. Since then the rathaus was used as a jail and a military clothing store. In 1825 a big storm torn away the sculpture of the archangel. On September 28, 1868 a great fire took place in the city. Originating on the southern side it spread throughout the rest of the city burning down the Ratusz as well. Out of the city hall was left only its steel framework. After 200 years the building was destroyed for the first time. =Late 19th century= The rebuilding of the rathaus, however, started rather quickly, and in 1870 in the city the construction of a new Ratusz by a Lviv construction company was initiated. The architects of the new building were Anasthasius Przybilowski and Filip Pokutynski. On June 6, 1870, a foundation of the new rathaus was installed. Inside of the foundation was placed a capsule with a parchment about the history of the rathaus and old Polish and Austrian coins and medals. The construction was finished the next year, in 1871. The new rathaus was in the form of a massive two-story building with a tall tower (preserved from the previous design). Up to the fifth floor it was covered with a white marble. Over it were placed observation galleries, over which a clock hung on the four sides of the tower. A nearly spherical elongated dome topped the building. The main feature of the rathaus was the session hall of the city's council. In the basement of the building once again were located rooms of preliminary detention (arrest home). During World War I in February 1915 several military engagements took place in the vicinity of Stanislawow, from which the rathaus received numerous cracks. The building itself did not fall; however, it was announced to be in emergency conditions. =20th century= After World War I, the war in Eastern Europe continued on until the 1920s as old empires were falling apart, particularly due to change of power in the former Russian Empire. In the first years after the war Poland went through some difficult financial times and it took some time before the government decided to restore the old city hall. In 1929, the Polish government engaged Krash and Company, engineers, to work on the rathaus. That December, the local government accepted a bid on the building and in 1930 accepted a design from architect Stanislaw Trela. During the installation of the foundation of the building's south-eastern wing, workers installed a time capsule containing plans of the new design, photos of the old rathaus, and other documents. Initial plans had the construction finished in 1932, but, due to lack of financing, the construction continued until 1935, while decorative work continued until World War II. The rathaus survived World War II. The building design represents a cross (the Order of Virtuti Militari). At the intersection of the cross rises a tower topped with a dome which is reminiscent of a military helmet. On the fourth floor at each corner were placed bronze eagles that represent the Polish state symbol (Orze≈Ç Bia≈Çy). During renovations in 1957 those \\"ideologically alien\\" creations were replaced with inexpressive sculptural decorations. The complete height of the rathaus is , a height that at the time of construction made it the tallest structure in the city. Unlike the previous versions of the building, it was not used as a town hall, but rather as a symbolic representation of the past. The space in the building was leased to numerous stores which, after the \\"Golden September\\" (the Soviet term for the invasion of Poland in 1939), were closed. During the Nazi occupation Hitler's followers tried to destroy the building. However, they were unable to blow it up as the rathaus was built out of reinforced concrete. The Germans managed, however, to blow up its northwestern wing; they ran out of time to destroy the rest of the building. After the Soviet liberation the building was used as a warehouse. In 1957 the oblast Regional Administration financed a renovation project that continued until 1958. On April 26, 1959 the building opened as was a regional museum.

It is a microaerotolerant anaerobe and considered to be one of the earliest colonizers of the gastrointestinal tract of infants. When grown on general anaerobic medium, B. longum forms white, glossy colonies with a convex shape. While B. longum is not significantly present in the adult gastrointestinal tract, it is considered part of the gut microbiota and its production of lactic acid is believed to prevent growth of pathogenic organisms. B. longum is non- pathogenic and is often added to food products.  Classification  In 2002, three previously distinct species of Bifidobacterium, B. infantis, B. longum, and B. suis, were unified into a single species named B. longum with the biotypes infantis, longum, and suis, respectively. This occurred as the three species had extensive DNA similarity including a 16s rRNA gene sequence similarity greater than 97%. In addition, the three original species were phenotypically difficult to distinguish due to different carbohydrate fermentation patterns among strains of the same species. As probiotic activity varies among strains of B. longum, interest exists in the exact classification of new strains, although this is made difficult by the high gene similarity between the three biotypes. Currently, strain identification is done through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on the subtly different 16s rRNA gene sequences.  Environment  B. longum colonizes the human gastrointestinal tract, where it, along with other Bifidobacterium species, represents up to 90% of the bacteria of an infant's gastrointestinal tract. This number gradually drops to 3% in an adult's gastrointestinal tract as other enteric bacteria such as Bacteroides and Eubacterium begin to dominate. Some strains of B. longum were found to have high tolerance for gastric acid and bile, suggesting that these strains would be able to survive the gastrointestinal tract to colonize the lower small and large intestines. The persistence of B. longum in the gut is attributed to the glycoprotein-binding fimbriae structures and bacterial polysaccharides, the latter of which possess strong electrostatic charges that aid in the adhesion of B. longum to intestinal endothelial cells. This adhesion is also enhanced by the fatty acids in the lipoteichoic acid of the B. longum cell wall.  Metabolism  B. longum is considered to be a scavenger, possessing multiple catabolic pathways to use a large variety of nutrients to increase its competitiveness among the gut microbiota. Up to 19 types of permease exist to transport various carbohydrates with 13 being ATP-binding cassette transporters. B. longum has several glycosyl hydrolases to metabolise complex oligosaccharides for carbon and energy. This is necessary as mono- and disaccharides have usually been consumed by the time they reach the lower gastrointestinal tract where B. longum resides. In addition, B. longum can uniquely ferment galactomannan-rich natural gum using glucosaminidases and alpha-mannosidases that participate in the fermentation of glucosamine and mannose, respectively. The high number of genes associated with oligosaccharide metabolism is a result of gene duplication and horizontal gene transfer, indicating that B. longum is under selective pressure to increase its capability to compete for various substrates in the gastrointestinal tract. Furthermore, B. longum possesses hydrolases, deaminases, and dehydratases to ferment amino acids. B. longum also has bile salt hydrolases to hydrolyze bile salts into amino acids and bile acids. The function of this is not clear, although B. longum could use the amino acids products to better tolerate bile salts.  Pathogenesis  A number of cases of B. longum infection have been reported in the scientific literature. These are primarily cases in preterm infants that are undergoing probiotic treatment, although there are also reports of infection in adults. Infection in preterm infants manifests as bacteremia or necrotizing enterocolitis, while in adults there have been reports of sepsis and peritonitis.  Research  B. longum is a constituent in VSL#3. This proprietary, standardized, formulation of live bacteria may be used in combination with conventional therapies to treat ulcerative colitis, and requires a prescription. = Immune system regulation = The use of B. longum was shown to shorten the duration and minimize the severity of symptoms associated with the common cold with a similar effect to that of neuraminidase inhibitors for influenza. = Bifidobacterium longum 35624 = Bifidobacterium longum ssp. longum 35624, previously classified as Bifidobacterium longum ssp. infantis 35624, classified as Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 before that and still marketed as such. It is sold under the brand name Align in the US and Canada and Alflorex in Ireland, the UK and other European countries. It is patented. This strain was isolated directly from the epithelium of the terminal ileum of a healthy human subject, and is one of the most researched probiotic strains.

Given names Pashtun given names are derived up from the Pashto language itself. When Islam was introduced officially in Afghanistan, other names adopted by Pashtuns came from Arabic though at times, take the phonology of Pashto, e.g. the Arabic \\"Zulaikha\\", a woman's name, can become \\"Zlaikha\\" due to the consonant cluster nature of Pashto. Other names come directly from Pashto itself and will display pronunciation differences germane to the two main accents of Pashto. For example \\"Zarlakht\\" a Pashtun girl's name as pronounced in Peshawar and Kabul (and other northern Pashtuns) will be pronounced as \\"Zarlasht\\" by the Pashtuns of Kandahar and Quetta (as well as other Pashtun populations who inhabit regions further to the southern regions of Afghanistan and northern Pakistan). Surnames Surnames can either come from being borrowed from other languages or from the Pashto language or used from given names. There are many different types of surnames used among Pashtuns. Many Pashtuns that come from developing regions are known by their mononym due to a lack of a legal identification system. They may also have multiple mononyms (i.e. may be called by multiple personal names). However, they will know the name of their tribe even prior to registering a legal identity. Understanding Pashtun tribal systems makes it easier to understand Pashtun surnames based on tribal lineage. Many Pashto last names come from the name of the tribe or the subdivisions of a specific tribe: in this case their name would end in -zai (son) or khel (group), (e.g. a Ghilzai Pashtun would likely have Ghilzai as their last name and a Pashtun from specifically the Adamkhel subtribe may use Adamkhel as their last name). Some tribal names have no suffix (e.g. Afridi, Sarbanri, Abdali). One must understand that many Pashtun tribes are composed of super tribes and subtribes, in other words, there are several tribes within tribes branching off and ranked in different tiers. For example, an Omarkhel Yusufzai Pashtun would have the option to use the name of their super tribe name \\"Sarbanri\\", their tribe Yusufzai, or Omarkhel, a subdivision of Yusufzai. Tribal names are usually patrilineal. The ancestral line of females generally is not included as part of the identity. Some Pashtun families that modernize pick a random name typically derived from Persian or Arabic and continue it as a family name down the line. That name may have little to no relation to their tribal standings. Other-times, the first name of the father may become the last name of the child, and so on and so forth. Surnames based on location are not common due to the rural transhumance semi-nomadic nature of Pashtuns in most their history, there are not surnames tied to a cities or locations. But rarely some tribes identify them with location like khostwal, Bannuchis, Bunerwal etc. This is why Pashtuns are identified with groups of people moving around. However, locations are given a name based on the people that occupy them. Few Pashtun communities use the name \\"Pashtun\\" as their last name, as Gujjars will use Gujjar or Baloch people will use Baloch. These are names of the undivided ethnic groups. Pathan is used as a surname among Pashtun communities living in the Indian subcontinent because they are known as Pathans or Pashtuns to their neighbouring communities, so they simplify it as a surname rather than their tribal name (it is important to mention one's tribal surname among Pashtuns, but in lands where they are a minority Afghans or Pathans will often be used instead). Afghan is an archaic name, and has been used among Pashtuns in Iran to signify other Iranians their Pashtun ancestry because they are known as Afghans to Iranians and the Arab world. Khan is also a name used commonly among Pashtuns, though it is not native to the Pashtun language and was adopted by Pashtuns via cross cultural exchanges between Turko-Mongol peoples and the Pashtuns when the Pashtun lands were ruled by Mongol peoples and the Turk people. Khan also means king or leader or strong or royal etc., which could be another reason for its adoption. Mostly Khan is used by those pashtuns who have served Turko-Mongol rulers over central Asia and south Asia Distribution Pashtun names are found among the Pashtun population, and some Tajiks and South Asians will carry Pashtun names, a sign of Pashtun ancestry among them, at-least patrilineal ancestry. The dardic Pashayis and Indo-Aryan Hindkowans do not speak Pashto but have 30-60% of their people familiar with and living in a Pashtun culture. The assimilated communities may have traces of people with given names derived exclusively from Pashto.

Even if ESN stands for Erasmus Student Network, referring to the European Erasmus programme, the section doesn't limit its program to only European students but focuses on all international minded students in √Öbo (in Finnish Turku), Finland. ESN √Öbo Akademi was founded 1994 and is the second oldest ESN Section in Finland. Historically ESN √Öbo Akademi has been a very active section being the first one in Finland to officially register at the national association office, and having had several former actives working on the ESN International level. The section aims at fostering the integration between international students and local students in √Öbo, Finland. This is done by organizing trips, both within Finland and abroad, cultural events, parties, sport events, etc.All ESN √Öbo Akademi events can be found at the webpage www.esnabo.fi __TOC__ Background √Öbo Akademi University has every year over 200 exchange students and hundreds of international students and researchers. The international students reach over 10% of the total number of students in the university which makes √Öbo Akademi University the most international university in Finland.http://www.abo.fi The association aims at fostering the integration between the exchange students and the local students at √Öbo Akademi University and to improve the well-being of the exchange students in √Öbo. The section organizes trips, parties, sport and cultural events, etc. In √Öbo there is, except ESN √ÖA, also two other ESN sections: ESN IAC and ESN Uni Turku. Together with ESN √ÖA the three sections form the unofficial ESN Turku - √Öbo, which organizes most of the biggest ESN events in the city. History ESN √ÖA joined the ESN network in 1994, and is the second oldest ESN section in Finland. The section has been, since it was founded, very active on all levels - Local, National and International, having had several National Representatives representing Finland on the international level, and also having had board members in the ESN International board, the most prestige duties within the ESN organization. During recent years ESN √Öbo Akademi has cooperated a lot with the two other ESN sections in Turku and so improved its activities notably. ESN √Öbo Akademi has also taken a very active role in the work of the new, in 2010 registered, ESN Finland ry., being responsible for several projects within this organization. ESN √Öbo Akademi traditions Being from the only Swedish-speaking multidisciplinary university in Finland, ESN √Öbo Akademi has during the years established some traditions different from other ESN Sections in Finland. The most important is the Sitz Parties, a tradition involving informal dinner parties including a lot of singing. This tradition comes originally from Sweden, but has a long history within the Swedish-speaking minority in Finland. In Finland an important tradition is the student boilersuits used by the students especially during informal parties. ESN gots since 2009 also its own ones. ESN in √Öbo/Turku was the first city in Finland to get own boilersuits, after which it also spread to other cities and ESN sections in Finland. Each year over 250 international student acquire student boilersuits from ESN or from their own subject associations. ESN Turku-√Öbo organizes also twice a year a City Race for the new international students. This race takes the students around √Öbo and gets them to know important and touristic places in the city. International tutors and members of ESN √Öbo Akademi cooperate in this event. Since 2010 ESN √ÖA organises the weekly sports events, mostly Futsal. ESN √Öbo Akademi, since several years ago, also organizes monthly theme movie evenings.

The technology is based on a round basin with a central drain. Above the drain the water forms a stable line vortex which drives a water turbine. It was first patented by Greek-Australian Lawyer & Inventor Paul Kouris in 1996, who was searching for a way to harness the power inherent in a vortex. Later, Austrian Inventor Franz Zotl√∂terer created a similar turbine while attempting to find a way to aerate water without an external power source.  Design  A gravitation water vortex plant with a Zotl√∂terer turbine near Ober-Grafendorf, Austria The water passes through a straight inlet and then passes tangentially into a round basin. The water forms a big vortex over the center bottom drain of the basin. A turbine withdraws rotational energy from the vortex, which is converted into electric energy by a generator. The turbine's theoretical energy conversion efficiency is up to 85%; a test installation reported 73% efficiency, and after a year of use its installation cost was just under one US dollar per Watt of output capacity. The turbine's aeration of the water helps improve water conditions, while the reduced speeds of the turbine and the lack of cavitation ensure that most types of fish can pass through the turbine without danger, something which is much more difficult to achieve at normal hydro plants that require additional structures for the fish migration.

Known as the Los Angeles Invitational (1959), its name later (1969) developed into the primary sponsors name, the Sunkist Invitational. Smith coached many world-class athletes including record high-jumpers Cornelius Johnson and Charles Dumas. From 1940 to 1942, Smith served as president of the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA). Early sprint life USC sprinter Herschel Curry Smith Herschel started his track and field career as a sprinter at San Fernando High School. In 1922 he won the California High School 100-yard championship and the California State 100 meters at 10.4 seconds. In 1923 he won both Southern California, CIF sprint titles including the 100 meters at 10.2 seconds and the National Interscholastic 220-yard title. After high school, he continued his sprint career for four more years at the University of Southern California as a member of Dean Cromwell‚Äôs track team. While at USC, Smith's freshman year provided him with a first-place win at the Western Olympic trials in the 100 meter at 10.8 seconds and a 2nd-place finish in the 200 meter. Initially expected to make the 1924 Olympic team, illness prevented Smith from participating at the 1924 Paris Olympic Games. The following year 1925, he won the Junior National AAU Championship 100-yard dash in 9.8 seconds. Continuing in 1926 with the Trojans' track team, he enjoyed a winning season, helping the team win the ICAAAA National Championship. The following year was the peak of Smith‚Äôs on-field running accomplishments. As part of a relay foursome (Smith, House, Lewis, Borah), Smith participated in breaking the world record in the 800 meter and 880-yard relay (4√ó220) at 1:25.8 seconds, in Los Angeles on May 14, 1927. Track coach In 1928 Smith became a coach at Compton Jr. College and High School (both included as one organization at the time) and began nourishing and producing track and field athletes. As a junior college, Compton provided a stepping stone for athletes to train and develop before progressing onto a major four-year college. Smith recruited the best athletes he could find from across the country and coached his prot√©g√©s to top performance levels, helping win many championships for the college. In 1936, Herschel was the coach of high jump-Olympic record holder and gold medalist Cornelius Johnson. Later (1956) Herschel was the coach of world record holder and Olympic gold medalist Charles Dumas, the first person to high-jump over 7 feet (7 feet 1/2 inch). Compton's coaching program fostered and produced many other champions including later Olympic gold medalist Simeon Iness, Earlene Brown, Herman Ray Stokes, Jerome Walters, George Henry Brown, Jr., and George Jefferson.

Goddard served as an apprentice printer under James Parker and in 1762 became an early American publisher who eventually founded several newspapers during his lifetime. His mother, father and sister were also involved with printing and publishing in the middle 18th century. For a short term Goddard was also a postmaster of Providence, Rhode Island. Later his newspaper partnership with Benjamin Franklin in Philadelphia would play an important role in the development of Franklin's ideas for a postal system in the soon to be united colonies. Franklin was postmaster of Philadelphia from 1759 to 1775 when he was dismissed by the British Crown for exposing the letters of Massachusetts Governor Thomas Hutchinson. Goddard's association with Franklin while he was serving as the Postmaster in Philadelphia played an important role when Franklin was introducing many of the reforms and improvements needed in the colonial postal system currently in use.American Heritage Magazine, The U.S. Post Office, 1775-1974New York Times/ABOUT.COM During the few years leading up to the Revolution Goddard became well noted for the innovations he introduced to the postal system as it came to be employed in mail delivery between the various colonies. Goddard's postal system came about as the result of a series of conflicts involving his newspaper, The Pennsylvania Chronicle, and the Crown Post, a postal administration and mail delivery system that was in use in the British colonies prior to the advent of American independence, under the authority of the British crown. As the idea of revolution began to surface throughout the colonies the British began manipulating the Crown Post (the colonial mail system) by blocking the mail and communications between the various colonies in an effort to prevent them from organizing with each other. The Crown also resorted to the delaying or destroying of newspapers and opening and reading private mail, a form of postal censorship that the British crown considered legal. Goddard's Pennsylvania Chronicle was sympathetic to the revolutionary ideas being put forth by Benjamin Franklin, and others, and so his publication was routinely criticized and under the constant scrutiny of the Crown Post authorities. Franklin had just fallen from grace with the British monarchy by exposing Massachusetts governor Thomas Hutchinson with his own letters, showing him to be in collusion with British efforts to impose more laws and taxes on the colonies in America, and so his involvement with the Chronicle further prompted the Crown in their dealings with Goddard's newspaper. In their effort to see the Pennsylvania Chronicle delivered, Franklin and Goddard persevered and in the midst of British scrutiny would create a separate postal system that ultimately became the postal system in use in the United States today. With the colonies then in dire need of a postal system the committee of correspondence in Boston wrote to the committee in Salem in March 1774 suggesting that an independent postal system be set up, and introduced William Goddard as a more than qualified man for such an undertaking.Smithsonian National Postal MuseumJournalism Department University of Rhode IslandThe Library of Congress Early years William Goddard's parents, both prominent figures in Connecticut society, were Dr. Giles Goddard, a wealthy doctor and postmaster of New London under Benjamin Franklin, and Sarah Updike Goddard, who was also well educated and later ran a family printing business.Baltimore Heritage Soon after Giles Goddard died, Goddard‚Äôs mother Sarah Updike moved the family to Providence, Rhode Island, where William opened his first printing business. Here in 1762 he founded the Providence Gazette and was the newspaper's publisher and editor. His friend John Carter, was the newspaper's printer.Eighteenth-Century American Newspapers in the Library of CongressLater, on September 27, 1787, the Providence Gazette under Carter printed the U.S. Constitution on the front page. Carter was also taught the printing trade while serving as an apprentice under Benjamin Franklin and who later was appointed Postmaster of Providence by Franklin.Rhode Island Historical Society In 1767 Goddard founded the Pennsylvania Chronicle. In 1772 he founded Baltimore's first newspaper, The Maryland Journal and later The Baltimore Advertiser. William's older sister was Mary Katherine Goddard who, inspired by her father, was an accomplished printer and the publisher of the Maryland Journal and the Baltimore Advertiser and who later managed her brother William's newspaper, The Pennsylvania Chronicle. In 1775 she was appointed Baltimore‚Äôs first postmaster . At the time, her post office was the busiest in the nation. She held this position until 1789.Maryland State Archives Mary became famous for accepting the task of publishing the first certified copy of the Declaration of Independence in January 1777 that included the signatures of all the state delegates.Distinguished Women of Past and PresentMiner, William Goddard: Newspaperman, 1962 p.166 Mary helped him with the Maryland Journal where she remained until 1792. In 1755 William Goddard started an apprenticeship in the New Haven shop of James Parker, one of the most successful printers in the colonies at the time.'Encyclopedia.com' In 1762, after the death of her husband, Mary Goddard helped William, then at the age of 22, set up a printing press in Providence, Rhode Island. With the help of his mother and sister the Goddards published Providence's first newspaper, The Providence Gazette. William, growing more restless with revolutionary sentiments, quit the Goddards' printing company in Rhode Island to start a newspaper in Philadelphia under the see of Benjamin Franklin, leaving his sister and mother to run the printing company and Gazette in Rhode Island. As revolutionary sentiments grew and the revolution with Britain drew closer William‚Äôs mother and sister took over operations at the Gazette for William when he began to spend his time and finances undertaking other business matters with Benjamin Franklin and others.Mary Goddard; Smithsonian National Postal Museum Women in the U.S. Postal System American Revolution In 1774, in response to the Boston Tea Party, the British Parliament passed what was referred to by the colonists as the Intolerable Acts. Prime Minister Lord North introduced the first measure, the Boston Port Bill, on March 18, 1774. The intrusive bill passed both houses of Parliament with little opposition and was signed by the King at the end of the month. American Public University Among other measures the Intolerable Acts closed the port of Boston and radically altered the government of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Many colonists viewed the acts as an arbitrary violation of their rights, and in response they organized the First Continental Congress on September 5 of 1774 at Carpenters' Hall in Philadelphia to establish a representative political body to oppose such laws. When the Boston riots erupted in September 1774, the colonies began to lose trust of the British crown entirely. Since most of the Colonists were born in the colonies at that time and had never seen the actual 'mother land' they had very little sentiment left for King George III or for the British authorities in the colonies. As a result, the Continental Congress was convened at Philadelphia in May 1775 to establish an independent government that would represent the colonists and oppose the arbitrary rules thrust upon them by the Crown. One of the first questions before the delegates was how to collect and deliver the mail between the various colonies. Franklin who had just returned from England was appointed chairman of a Committee of Investigation to establish a postal system for the colonies. The issue was a pressing one as the existing Crown Post was now routinely manipulating the mail of the colonists prior to the revolution. William Goddard experienced the abuse of authority of the Crown Post in Philadelphia after forming a partnership with Benjamin Franklin to publish the Pennsylvania Chronicle, a paper sympathetic to the revolutionary cause. Goddard was one among several publishers who used private carriers rather than those of the British crown to deliver his Chronicle so as to get the newspapers past the scrutiny of the Crown post who was opposed to Goddard and his Chronicle for their revolutionary sympathies.Dalphy I. Fagerstrom, Bethel College, Saint Paul So adamant was the Crown towards Goddard and the Chronicle that the local Crown postmaster intercepted and refused to deliver mail and other newspapers from other cities and towns to Goddard, depriving him of a critical source of information. The Crown Post also imposed a heavy tax on newspaper delivery. In 1773 the Pennsylvania Chronicle was finally forced to go out of business when the Crown post refused to deliver the newspaper in the mail. Goddard in revolutionary defiance circumvented these efforts by designing an alternative, and distinctly American, postal system and challenged the Crown post, and the principles of free speech that it was supposedly founded on, by creating the Constitutional Post which among other things involved establishing a postal route in and between Philadelphia and New York. Goddard's Constitutional Post came into use right after the commencement of American Revolution at Cambridge, Massachusetts. He chose for his main Post Office to be housed in the London Coffee House in Philadelphia, a meeting place for merchants which became the center of much of the political life of the city prior to and during the American Revolution.Independence Hall Association, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, founded 1942 The Constitutional Post Credit is roundly given to Benjamin Franklin for being the architect of a postal system that is still in use today in the United States. Franklin had made significant contributions to the postal system in the colonies while serving as the postmaster of Philadelphia from 1737 to 1753, and as joint postmaster general of the colonies from 1753 to 1774. Franklin's partnership with William Goddard in 1775 however played an integral role in the development of his ideas for a national postal system that was serve the soon to be United colonies. Goddard's ideas for a postal system were spurred by the Crown Post authorities who were manipulating the mail of the colonies as the revolution became more eminent. Goddard and his associates were forced to create an alternative system that came to be known as The Constitutional Post that would provide mail service to the colonies between New York and Philadelphia. Goddard had presented his plan for a postal system to Congress beforehand on October 5, 1774, nearly two years before the Declaration of Independence was given to England. Congress had to deal with other urgent matters and had to delay Goddard's plan until after the Battles of Lexington and Concord in the Spring of 1775.HISTORY.COM On July 26, 1775 the plan, now known as the \\"Constitutional Post\\", was adopted and implemented, thus assuring communication between the colonies and keeping them informed of various events during the conflict with Britain. Distrustful of the Crown the colonial populous was turning to and using the postal system now provided by Goddard. Ultimately Goddard and his revolutionary post were so successful they finally forced the Crown post out of business in the American colonies on Christmas Day, 1775. Goddard's Constitutional Post proved to be a success and by 1775, when the Continental Congress met at Philadelphia, Goddard's colonial post was flourishing, and 30 post offices operated between Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and Williamsburg, Pennsylvania. Goddard's plan for a colonial post office would be one that was established and maintained by popular subscription and would be managed and controlled by a private committee that would be elected annually by the subscribers. The committee would appoint postmasters, determine postal routes, hire post-riders and fix the rates of postage. In what was to Goddard an unexpected turn of events, when the Continental Congress on July 26, 1775 authorized a post office run by the government it passed over Goddard and instead named Benjamin Franklin as the first American Postmaster General. Franklin pass for Goddard September 4th 1776 Goddard, a one time apprentice of Franklin and who was naturally influenced by his years of experience with the colonial postal system, still felt that he was the general creator of the postal system then in use in the colonies. Naturally he was disappointed when Benjamin Franklin was given the position of Postmaster by the Continental Congress. However he naturally conceded to Franklin, who was 36 years his senior, and to his many years of experience as postmasters and reluctantly but graciously agreed to serve instead as Riding Surveyor for the new U.S. Post Office. Franklin drew up a pass that allowed Goddard to travel at his discretion in his new position. Franklin authored and signed the pass and presented it to Goddard. When the newly created American government under the U.S. Constitution began, the American postal system had about seventy-five post offices and 1,875 miles of post roads to serve a total colonial population of three million people. Franklin served as postmaster for one year at which time the Postmaster's position was given to Richard Bache, the son-in-law of Franklin. Deeply disappointment for being passed over again Goddard resigned. Franklin would later leave the Bonds he had on the Goddards to Bache in his last will and testament of 1788. Franklin died in 1790. It was not until after the adoption of the Constitution in 1789 that a law passed on September 22, 1789, (1 Stat. 70) which created the federal Post Office under the new government of the United States and authorized the appointment of a Postmaster General who was subject to the direction of the President U.S. National Archives and Records Administration Four days later President Washington appointed the post of Postmaster General to Samuel Osgood who became the first Postmaster General under the new United States Constitution. Along with the efforts of Benjamin Franklin who pioneered the colonial mail system, Goddard and the Constitutional Post influenced Franklin greatly and helped him in the endeavor of producing a system of mail delivery for the united colonies that is still in use today in the United States and elsewhere. Later years While working for the post-office, his sister Mary, in his absence, managed and edited the Maryland Journal single handedly. Because resources were scarce due to the Revolutionary War the paper for the Journal became scarce, so in 1778, Goddard started up a paper-mill in Baltimore, and made his own paper. In its issue of May 5, 1778, appears the following notice: \\"Rags for the paper-mill near this town are much wanted, and the highest price will be given for them by the printer,\\" and again \\"Cash will be given in exchange for rags at this office.\\" The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography ¬© 1950 The Historical Society of Pennsylvania - JSTOR Sometime after mid-1778, Goddard was joined at the Maryland Journal by Eleazer Oswald a former American artillery officer. Oswald printed criticisms of George Washington by the disgraced general Charles Lee and this led to public demonstrations against him. Oswald left the Journal and moved to Philadelphia in 1782., 820 Goddard's relationship with his sister Mary Katherine became strained in the following years, possibly because of financial issues. In January 1784, William's name was added to the colophon of the newspaper and Mary Katherine's name was dropped. William continued to be the head of the newspaper and his sister remained in town as a publisher and postmistress. Late in 1784, William and Mary had published rival almanacs for 1785, which led to William levying attacks at both her almanac and her character. In 1785, she sold her interest in the Maryland Journal which effectively ended her business dealings with William and the newspaper she had helped found. In 1785, Goddard married Abigail Angell of Johnston, Rhode Island (daughter of Brigadier-General James Angell and Mary Mawney Angell). William and Abigail had 5 children: 4 daughters and 1 son. In 1803 he left Johnston for Providence, so that his children might have more educational advantages. Son, William Giles Goddard, graduated from Brown University in 1812. Goddard was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1813.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory Goddard lived in Providence until his death, December 22, 1817, aged seventy-seven years. He is buried in the North Burial Ground at Providence, Rhode Island.

At home, she lies to her sexually-stimulated parents about having had breakfast, and informs them that it is her last clinic day. She is then picked up by the clinic taxi driver, Allan, with whom she seems to have a close relationship. He promises not to tell that she has put weights in her underwear so she can fool the clinic into thinking she is eating. At the clinic, Cassie is discharged by Abigail's psychiatrist mother, Dr. Stock, and sent to her final group therapy. At group therapy, fellow patient Madison Twatter tells the group about a student named Sid Jenkins who got drugs on credit terms from him and never paid him back (the events of the previous episode). He is furious, and tells the group that he has Sid's student card. In college, Cassie runs into Sid at the canteen, and they talk. She reveals to him how she is able to get away with hiding the fact that she is not eating, but he is not impressed with it, and protests. When she states that \\"no-one cares,\\" he responds \\"I care.\\" Tony turns up and immediately starts berating Sid for his laziness and dirtiness. Cassie, wanting to defend Sid, deliberately nudges a tray in order to spill Sid's Coca-Cola on Tony's trousers, making it look as though he's wet himself, which angers him enough to attack fellow student Posh Kenneth. Before he leaves, Cassie warns Sid about Mad and mentions he has his student card. Tony goes to the staff changing room to dry his trousers, and inadvertently runs into a completely naked Angie, who has just been showering. Angie chastises Tony about being in the female staff room, but makes no effort to cover her breasts until Sid turns up to mention that Mad Twatter knows where he is. Sid is quickly followed into the changing room by Chris, laughing at Tony's fight with Kenneth, only to panic and drag them out when he sees Angie is there. Later, Sid tells his friends and Angie about Mad having his student ID card, but no one seems able to help him. As Sid continues to worry about Mad, who gets a teaching position at the college, Cassie continues to get text messages saying \\"eat!\\". When these texts seem to coincide with Sid using his phone, she assumes he is sending the texts. When she confronts him over it, he denies it, and tells her that she has no messages on her phone. Scared and confused, Cassie calls Allan. She tells him someone keeps telling her to eat, and he implies she is imagining the texts because she is mentally sending them to herself, because she wants to eat. Cassie gives in and eats a burger.

She finds post-its and receives texts saying \\"eat!\\". This is the first time on Skins that the audience see something other than the \\"reality\\" of the show. This effect is possible as the episode is told from that character's point of view.

They rapped predominantly in the Cape Flats dialect of Afrikaans. The original line-up included Deon Daniels (Boeta-D), Roger Heunis (Hamma), Ashley Titus (Mr Fat) and Enver Pietersen (DJ E20). Bboys Cheeze, Baby-L and Levi joined the group soon after they started to perform live. Their debut album was a self-titled project named BVK and was released through Ghetto Ruff Records in 1997. This album became successful on the Afrikaans music circuit with tracks like \\"Fords Nissans Toys en Beetles (FNTB)\\", \\"Jy smaak my\\", \\"Kaap van storms\\", and many others getting high rotation on radio stations all over the country. It also received a South African Music Awards (SAMA) nomination for best hip hop album in 1998. Their second album titled Yskoud was released in 2000. They became one of the most booked hip hop acts in the country and toured consistently for close to 6 years. Yskoud was also nominated for a SAMA award in 2001. DJ E20 left the band soon after the release of BVK and was first replaced with DJ Big Dre. DJ Big Dre's appearance in the band was short-lived and he was replaced by DJ Azuhl. BVK was the first band to part take in the international exchange initiative between Belgium music festival Pukkelpop and South African music festival Oppikoppi in 2000. Hamma left the band in 2001. His replacement was Garlic Brown a.k.a. Judah. Even with their hectic tour schedules, the band still found time to engage in community out-reach projects, charities and workshops.'Mr. Fat was larger than life', News24. Mr. Fat (Ashley Titus) died on November 27, 2007 from heart complications. Garlic Brown continues to perform as a solo artist and as a member of the hip-hop collective the League Of Shadows, and appeared on Die Antwoord's 2009 debut, $O$.

The PlayStation version was released in North America on October 31, 1996, in Europe in February 1997, and Japan on August 7, 1997. The PC version was released on November 13, 1997. On February 4, 2007 Jet Moto was made available for the PlayStation Portable and PlayStation 3 via the PlayStation Network. Developers chose fictional hovering bikes instead of wheeled motorcycles initially to resolve performance concerns. Other performance concerns led the team to develop two different physics systems-- one for the player, and one for the 19 computer racers. Gameplay in Jet Moto revolves around the use of hoverbikes to traverse a race course, similar to modern day motorcross, but with the added ability to traverse water. Reviews for the game were mixed, with the PC version holding 75% and the PlayStation version 78.9% at gaming aggregator GameRankings. Reviewers felt the game had solid gameplay, but criticized its high difficulty. Jet Motos popularity would earn it a spot in the PlayStation Greatest Hits in August 1998, and it went on to gain two additional sequels, Jet Moto 2 and Jet Moto 3. Gameplay In Jet Moto players control hoverbikes known as jet motos. These bikes have the ability to hover over both land and water. Jet Moto differs from that of a traditional racing game with cars or motorcycles. Players are introduced to the fictional sport of Jet Moto. The bikes, known as jet motos, are hovercraft which can traverse both land and water. The bikes race in groups of twenty in the game's equivalent of motorcross. Characters are split into teams, and bikes are adorned with logos of products such as Mountain Dew, Butterfinger and K2 Sports similar to real-life sponsored racing. In Jet Moto players control hoverbikes in a fictional motor sport. Players race three laps on a given course and earn series points based on their placement at the end of the race. Players can choose to race a single race, a season of races, or a custom season. Players can also unlock additional tracks and a stunt mode by doing well in season competitions. Courses range from beaches with debris-littered water to swamps and ice-covered mountains. The game has its variant of the traditional race track, but also introduces a new course type known as a Suicide course. Instead of being a continuous loop, these tracks have checkpoints at either end of the course, and the starting grid in the center. Riders race to one end, then turn around to head for the other checkpoint, repeating the process until all laps are complete. This provides a new gameplay dynamic as often the player must navigate oncoming traffic. The PlayStation version of the game allows for two player splitscreen multiplayer; however, no AI racers are present, which limits the competitors to two. A cheat code would allow two human players to race with the entire field. The PC version allows for fourteen players over an IPX network, Internet TCP/IP and modem-to-modem connections. Development Jet Moto features a comic style user interface created by Axiom Design. Jet Moto was conceived as a \\"science fiction motorcross.\\" The developers chose to create jet motos instead of wheeled motorcycles due to concerns over polygon limitations. Travis Hilton, one of the programmers for the game designed Jet Motos physics engine. Due to hardware limitations of the PlayStation, only the player used this physics system. Programmer Jay Barnson was tasked with developing a simpler physics system to handle the nineteen AI riders. During development a set of courses set in a stadium were dropped as the developers felt it did not fit the theme of the game. Developers originally intended for players to be permanently out of a race when falling far off a track, however they came to realize that it was not fun for players \\"to be forced to go slow or suffer an instant defeat.\\" An attempt was made to give three \\"strikes\\" to a rider. Once the rider fell for the third time they were out of the race. However once implemented developers noticed that the number of racers remaining at the end of the race was too random to be deemed any fun. In the end the decision was made to simply respawn the character on the track. The PC version was ported in large part by John Olsen, who worked on the port as his first task at SingleTrac. The PC version also features 3Dfx hardware acceleration, which allows for higher resolution gameplay and visual enhancements such as reflective water. Axiom Design created the user interface shell for the game, which has a comic book-inspired feel. The music for Jet Moto was produced by Big Idea Music Productions. Another SingleTrac game released for the PlayStation at roughly the same time, Twisted Metal 2, allows players to race on a track from Jet Moto by entering a code which appeared in advertisements for the game. Reception Jet Moto received varied reviews among critics, with the PC version averaging 75% and the PlayStation version averaging 78.9% at gaming aggregator GameRankings. Due to the game's popularity it was re-released on Sony's budget line, PlayStation Greatest Hits, in August 1998. The game was most often criticized for its controls and unusual physics, which some reviewers said never feel quite right no matter how long the game is played. Both a Next Generation critic and Air Hendrix of GamePro likened the overall sensation to riding through an atmosphere made of molasses. The controls, along with the opponent AI, contributed to some reviewers concluding the game had an excessively high degree of difficulty. However, the grappling feature was praised for its innovation and for adding greater depth to the challenge. Several reviewers commented that the graphics are highly uneven, looking impressive in some points and embarrassingly poor in others. GameSpot's review of the PC port praised the 3Dfx support. Several reviewers praised the soundtrack to the game. Mark Cooke of Game Revolution said the spy film-like title screen music in particular both sounded cool and was appropriate for the game. The surf guitar was a strong point for Electric Playground's Victor Lucas, who cited it as one of the best video game soundtracks of 1996. GameSpot reviewer Shane Mooney also praised the energy of the soundtrack. However, Air Hendrix said that though the menu music is decent, the in-game music is weak. While Lucas and GameSpots Glenn Rubenstein compared Jet Moto unfavorably to Wave Race 64, Next Generations reviewer argued that \\"in all fairness, the comparison isn't truly appropriate: where Wave Race is based around an existing vehicle that provides a basis of reference, there is no actual criterion for criticism on whether a jet moto game accurately emulates the 'jet motoing' experience.\\" He concluded that \\"despite [its] odd control and graphic characteristics, Jet Moto remains a lot of fun. With intense, challenging races featuring twenty competitors on ten unique tracks, it never fails to be compelling.\\" Chris Roper of IGN called it one of the best racing games available for the PlayStation. In contrast, Air Hendrix assessed that it \\"wipes out all over the pavement with finicky, mushy controls and painful gameplay.\\" Lucas praised the design of the jet moto bikes, stating the design was imaginative and vibrant. Todd Mowatt and Joe Rybicki of Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the game laudatory reviews, saying the track design is its best aspect. Rubenstein concluded that while devout racing game enthusiasts would be pleased at how long it takes to complete the game, the general gamer would have more fun with a game that's easier to learn. In its PlayStation 3 Retro Roundup, IGN opined the game held up well to its direct competitors at the time, Wave Race 64 and the Wipeout series, then stated Jet Moto was \\"still a pretty fun experience more than 10 years after its original release.\\" Legacy Jet Motos popularity would spawn two additional sequels, Jet Moto 2, also developed by SingleTrac, and Jet Moto 3, developed by Pacific Coast Power & Light. Two other titles were cancelled during their development. Pacific Coast Power & Light was also developing Jet Moto 2124 for the PlayStation, set over a century after the first three games, however the game was cancelled when Jet Moto 3 showed poor sales. Jet Moto: SOLAR, developed by RedZone Interactive, was also cancelled. SOLAR would have been the first title in the series to appear on the PlayStation 2. Present-day wishlists for video game sequels have often included Jet Moto. 1UP.com listed a fourth Jet Moto in their \\"Sequels We Want, and the Formulas They Need\\" feature, stating that Jet Moto \\"symbolized everything that made the original PlayStation cooler than anything else at the time\\". IGN felt similarly, listing Jet Moto in their \\"Dirty Dozen: Revival of the Fittest\\" feature, calling the game \\"a novel racer with enough staying power to make it an instant hit\\".

At one point, Agnosphitys was recovered as a possible saturnaliine until it was reclassified into the Silesauridae in 2017.Baron, M.G., Norman, D.B., and Barrett, P.M. (2017).

In 1878, he was martyred and his remains cannibalized. His remains along with other Fijian martyrs lay buried atop the Vunela Fijian martyrs cemetery Kabakada, East New Britain. Life The mission to New Britain was launched in 1875. Wesleyan pastor George Brown, the organizer, met with colonial opposition, as a result of British policy after the tragic epidemic which killed 40,000 in Fiji. He finally appealed to the students of Navuloa, the Methodist Theological School at the time, describing the dangers and pointing out that they might well be going to their deaths. Eighty three students were present and heard the appeal and after consulting their wives and families they all volunteered. The colonial government because of its strict native out-migration policy after the measles epidemic in early 1875 finally relented. By 1876 the new mission field at New Britain had been divided into two areas, one under Aminio Baledrokadroka and the other under Sailasa, and there were 14 teachers‚Äô stations. Thus began Fiji‚Äôs own missionary enterprise. In the year 1878, Sailasa the Fijian minister was journeying inland with a small party south of Kabakada on the Gazelle peninsula, and preaching the Gospel as he went; when they were suddenly attacked, slain and their bodies dismembered and cannibalized. As Thomas Baker was martyred in Fiji; so was Sailasa Naucukidi in New Britain as a result of the Wesleyan Church's proselytization missions in the latter part of the nineteenth century in the South Pacific. Lelean Memorial School, at Davuilevu, Nausori, Fiji, honours his memory by naming one of its four houses after him. Fijian Methodist missionaries have since helped spread the gospel in New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Northern Australia, Vanuatu and recently to the Caribbean.

She married her uncle Prince Maurice of Savoy but had no children. She was the owner of the future Villa della Regina. She was a first cousin of Louis XIV of France and Charles II of England. Biography Luisa Cristina was born at the Castello del Valentino in Turin. She was the eldest daughter of the future Victor Amadeus I, Duke of Savoy and his wife Christine Marie of France. Her birth was greeted with excitement as prior to her birth, her parents had lost a son and heir and were expecting another son.Osborne, Toby. Dynasty and Diplomacy in the Court of Savoy: Political Culture and the Thirty Years' War. Cambridge University Press. 2007. 236. However, being a female and due to the salic law, she was barred from succeeding to the Duchy of Savoy which at the time of her birth was ruled by her grandfather Charles Emmanuel I. Luisa Cristina was said to have been illegitimate and the fruit of her mother's supposed affair with a French courtier named \\"Pommeuse\\". As a child, two of her brothers succeeded their father who became ruler of Savoy in 1630. Her father died in 1637 and was succeeded quickly by her brother Francis Hyacinth who died in 1638 and was followed by another brother Charles Emmanuel II. Her mother took over a regency which was disputed by her uncles Thomas Francis, Prince of Carignano and Cardinal Maurice. The two brothers conspired against Christine Marie claiming the regency between the two of them causing a war in Savoy. The war resulted in Thomas Francis and Maurice fleeing to Spain for support which came to nothing. Her mother was soon victorious in the ensuing wars thanks to French support in the form of her brother, Louis XIII. Returning to Savoy, Luisa Cristina was soon engaged to Maurice as part of a reconciliation between Christine Marie.Osborne, Toby. Dynasty and Diplomacy in the Court of Savoy: Political Culture and the Thirty Years' War. Cambridge University Press. 2007. 41. Luisa Cristina married Maurice in Turin on 18 August 1642. Maurice had previously been a cardinal and had to receive permission from Pope Urban VIII who consented to the match. The thirteen-year- old bride and forty-nine-year-old Maurice moved to Nice where Maurice was the governor of the city - another part of the reconciliation. Her husband died in 1657 of a stroke leaving Luisa Cristina a widow aged twenty seven. Her husband willed her his large art collection as well as his huge debts.Vitelleschi, Marchese: The romance of Savoy, Victor Amadeus II. and his Stuart bride Volume II. New York: Harvard College Library. 1905. 345. In Turin she lived at her husband's villa outside Turin. She also did much to improve the structure under the direction of Amedeo di Castellamonte. She also commissioned Guarino Guarini to carry out works on churches in Savoy.Klaiber, Susan Elizabeth. Guarino Guarini's Theatine architecture. Columbia University. 1993. 294.

Peebles also did research that led to the development of fluoridated vitamins and did research that showed that tetanus vaccine could be given once every 10 years, rather than annually as had been the widespread practice. Peebles was born on June 5, 1921, in Newton, Massachusetts, and graduated from Harvard University in 1942 with a major in French language. He enlisted in the United States Navy and served as a bomber pilot in the Pacific Theater of Operations, earning the Distinguished Flying Cross. He had been recruited by KLM as a pilot after completing his military service but chose to apply to Harvard Medical School, which rejected him because he had received a D in college biology. He attended Boston University for a year, taking the pre-med courses he had not taken as an undergraduate. He was finally accepted by Harvard Medical School, but spent an intervening year teaching at an elementary school in South Carolina. He worked at a laundry to help pay for those medical school costs not covered by the G.I. Bill.Martin, Douglas. \\"Dr. Thomas C. Peebles, Who Identified Measles Virus, Dies at 89\\", The New York Times, August 4, 2010. Accessed August 4, 2010. After completing medical school he did an internship and residency in pediatrics at Massachusetts General Hospital, where he later became a Chief Resident of Pediatrics. He was also a Fellow at Children's Hospital Boston, where he worked with Dr. John Franklin Enders, known as \\"The Father of Modern Vaccines\\", who earned the Nobel Prize in 1954 for his research on cultivating the polio virus that led to the development of a vaccination for the disease. Switching to study measles, Peebles was sent to a Fay School where an outbreak of the disease was underway and was able to isolate the virus from some of the blood samples and throat swabs he took from students. Even after Enders had taken him off the study team, Peebles was able to cultivate the virus and show that the disease could be passed on to monkeys inoculated with the material he had collected. Enders was able to use the cultivated virus to develop a measles vaccine in 1963 based on the material isolated by Peebles.Staff. \\"Work by Enders Brings Measles Vaccine License\\", The Hartford Courant, March 22, 1963. Accessed August 4, 2010. \\"A strain of measles virus isolated in 1954 by Dr. Thomas C. Peebles, instructor in pediatrics at Harvard, and Enders, formed the basis for the development of the present vaccine\\". In the late 1950s and early 1960s, nearly twice as many children died from measles as from polio.Staff. \\"The Measles Vaccine\\", The New York Times, March 28, 1963. Accessed August 4, 2010. The vaccine for measles has led to the near-complete elimination of the disease in the United States and other developed countries. In a study he performed on the tetanus vaccine, he found that people were getting as much as 2,500 times the amount needed to provide protection, showing that the booster doses could be given once every ten years, rather than yearly, while substantially reducing the risk of allergic reactions caused by the higher dosages in common use. In his private practice, he noticed that patients from towns where the water was fluoridated had fewer cavities. He conducted research and determined a dosage that was included as part of a regular vitamin. Peebles died at age 89 on July 8, 2010, in his home in Port Charlotte, Florida. He was survived by his wife, the former Annie Diffley, as well as by a daughter, two sons and five grandchildren.

The Woodway church boasts the largest all-pipe Rodgers organ ever built, with 192 stops and 10,412 total pipes, qualifying the instrument as one of the largest pipe organs in the world. Although it was silenced for approximately one year due to severe water damage inflicted by Hurricane Ike in 2008, the organ is now played weekly in the church's traditional worship services, as well as for concerts and special events throughout the year. In addition to repairing the organ, the extensive damage from the hurricane required the church's Worship Center to be repaired and remodeled. It now contains seating for 5,500. In 1979 the church launched a weekly broadcast of worship services on local television. In 1982 a local radio program began, as well as national TV broadcasting known as The Winning Walk . Since then this has expanded into international television, radio and internet distribution of the church's message. In 2010, Second Baptist Church brought on the best selling Christian book author, Gary Thomas, as a writer in residence. Thomas also serves on Second's teaching team.

Under the leadership of Ed Young the church grew from an average weekend attendance of 500 in 1978 to over 32,000 today. The church has been described by its pastor as \\"a town within a city\\". In addition to worship facilities it has fitness centers, bookstores, information desks, a caf√©, a K-12 school and free automotive repair service for single mothers. Second Baptist Church now has 6 physical campuses in the Houston area and an online campus. In 2016, Second Baptist Church, in cooperation with other local churches, developed and launched Loving Kids, a ministry initiative that focuses on children in specific lower income areas with the goal of seeing literacy rates increase, school ratings improve, crime rates decrease and families becoming involved in the community's churches. Second Baptist also has a counseling center, offering biblical guidance and professional counseling.

It opened with Jazzland on May 20, 2000, and closed after August 21, 2005. It is currently SBNO (standing but not operating). History Zydeco Scream first started at the former Parc de Montjuic in Barcelona, Spain as Boomerang from 1990 to 1998, with white tracks and green supports. The roller coaster was relocated to Jazzland as Zydeco Scream in 2000. A couple years after Six Flags took over the park, Hurricane Katrina hit the park on August 29, 2005, and the park was severely flooded from the Hurricane. In 2007, Six Flags began to remove rides out of the park. Batman: The Ride was removed in 2007 and taken to Six Flags Fiesta Texas where it was refurbished and reopened as Goliath in 2008. Bayou Blaster and Sonic Slam were removed in 2008 and relocated to Great Escape in Queensbury, New York, where it was refurbished and reopened as Sasquatch in 2009. The Road Runner Express was removed in 2009 and relocated to Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia, California, where it was refurbished and reopened in 2011 under the same name. However, Zydeco Scream remains inactive at the park along with other roller coasters and attractions. The park is still closed since 2005 and it's no longer a Six Flags park, it is now owned by the city of New Orleans. In 2014, the Paidla Group/ Jazzland Redevelopment Group announced a proposal to reopen Jazzland and its rides, but however, the Zydeco Scream would be removed from the park even though it could be renovated and reopened. Officials said they would use the space for a new attraction. These plans have not gone into effect just yet, and as of May 2016, the coaster remains Standing But Not Operating . Ride experience Seeing Zydeco Scream while going toward the park. When the coaster started, the train was pulled backwards up the lift hill, then dropped through the loading gate through a cobra roll and then one loop. At the end of this cycle the train was pulled up the lift hill at the end of the track, then dropped once again allowing the train to go back through the loops backwards. This was the standard Vekoma Boomerang roller coaster design found at forty-three different amusement parks worldwide.

The first courthouse was built of lumber in 1847; it was and cost a total of $87.50. That courthouse was later moved to a farm near Newton. A second courthouse was a brick structure that was faced with limestone and built in 1857 at a total cost of $26,600. Its basement was sandstone. The building featured porticos that extended from the building that were held up by Ionic columns. A cupola that rose above the ground. Current courthouse The third and current courthouse was dedicated in 1911. The simplified version of the Beaux Arts style was designed by the prominent Des Moines architectural firm of Proudfoot & Bird. with It is built of Indiana limestone except for the doors and window casings which are wooden. American general and Iowa politician James B. Weaver wrote of the current courthouse in the 1912 county history, \\"long after the pages of this county history are worn and turned yellow with age, in all human probability this building will stand in all its massive beauty\\". The Jasper County Medical Society held their annual meetings at the courthouse. The courthouse measures with a clock tower that rises . The clock was created with the help of private donations, and its faces are set into the parapets around the tower. The interior has ceramic tile and marble, and freestanding column screens divide the hallways from the rotunda. The outside of the building is decorated during the Christmas season. There was a renovation of the courthouse in 1986 that fixed the interior and involved the dome and paintings. Then-governor of Iowa Terry Branstad visited the courthouse for its 100th anniversary on July 4, 2011. The significance of the courthouse is derived from its association with county government, and the political power and prestige of Newton as the county seat.

It was written by Bryan Elsley and directed by Adam Smith. It premiered on E4 on 8 February 2007. It is told from the point of view of main character Jal Fazer. Plot Jal is preparing for the final of the Young Musician of the Year Competition in London. She is called into the college director's office and told she is to tell the BBC how the college helped her due to her disadvantaged background. Jal feels this is racist to assume she has a disadvantaged background because she is black. At home, Jal attempts to practice the clarinet for the finals, but is unable on account of her brother's loud grime music. She complains to her dad that she needs to practise, but Ronny Fazer, a successful grime singer himself, is uninterested. He tells her that her brothers and their wigger friend, Donny, need to practise also. As she had plans to go shopping for a dress to wear to the competition with Michelle, Jal goes to Tony's and sits in the living room with Sid and Tony's little sister, Effy while Tony and Michelle have sex. Fed up of waiting for Michelle, Jal takes Sid with her instead. She tells Sid that she knows he loves Michelle, that it is obvious. Jal buys a brown dress for her competition, but seems convinced it is green. Later that night, she argues with her dad after she hears him rapping alone in his studio. During this, it is revealed that another major reason that Ronny resents Jal is her uncanny likeliness to her mother, who divorced him and left him heartbroken. That night, Jal and Michelle watch Jal's interview and joke over Jal's angsty lack of co-operation. As the group have plans to go to Jal's dad's club that night, Michelle helps Jal dress up as Michelle has a keen fashion sense. At the club, all of the boys, including Maxxie are stunned by Jal's dress which shows off her impressive bust. Sid and Michelle talk at the bar, while Tony flirts with Abigail. Michelle tells Sid she loves him like a brother, but not like a Welsh brother. Depressed by the news, Sid goes to the couch to sulk. While Michelle is distracted dancing to one of Fazer's songs, Tony snogs Abigail. Jal witnesses Tony's act of betrayal to Michelle, and distraught, sits and broods with Sid. The two agree to go out drinking with a man who had been chatting to Jal. However, he turns out to be an associate of Mad's, and leads them to a narrow alleyway where Mad steals Sid's credit cards and wallet and smashes Jal's expensive clarinet. Jal's brothers, Ace and Lynton chase after Mad, along with Donny, but Mad gets the better of them and they end up hospitalised. Enraged with what Mad did to his daughter, Ronny and his guys place a hit on Mad. He also buys Jal a new clarinet identical to the one she lost, symbolizing his support for her type of music and a promise to stop resenting her for her resemblance to his ex-wife. The final scene shows Jal at her competition in London.
