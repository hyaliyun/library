The combs were originally made for use by royalty and have been in production for over 2000 years.  Introduction  Comb is two kinds of utensils, namely wooden comb. Changzhou comb production technology was formed during the Eastern Jin Dynasty and has a history of more than 1,500 years. During the Ming and Qing Dynasties, the production process of Changzhou comb has reached a very high level, and the production scale has also exceeded the previous generations. The \\"Changzhou Fu\\" during the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty stated: \\"Cut bamboo into, and all households in Chaojingmen.\\" At that time, tens of thousands of people in Ximen and Nanmen of Changzhou were engaged in combing making, so Ximen had \\"Guiji Lane\\" , South Gate has \\"Mushu Street\\" as a place name. In the beginning of Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty, officials from the Suzhou Weaving House went to Changzhou every year to order a batch of fine combs, which were sent to the palace of the capital as imperial items. Double edged Comb in the museum  Development  In the past, the main unit of shop was household-side households scattered on the outskirts of the city. It seems to have been using the relatively primitive family life community as the basic unit of social production. With hereditary craftsmanship, the system characteristics of Changzhou comb grate industry with scattered and numerous grassroots are formed. These decentralized production methods are actually not conducive to process improvement and production efficiency. The lack of technical communication and cooperation leads to uneven product quality. It is not conducive to the development of the grate industry in Changzhou. Because of the reform and opening up, Changzhou comb industry has gradually formed a centralized comb manufacturer with Changzhou comb manufacturing factory as the center. The skillful folk craftsmen also gained the opportunity to show their talents. History Halfmoon Wooden Comb. Southern Song Dynasty.Production of hand- painted combs in Changzhou dates from the Eastern Zhou (770-221 BCE) (, also called The Transitional Period, ), the first master was Chen Qizi (). The hand-painted combs of Changzhou have been popular since the time of the Southern and Northern Dynasties. During the Qing Dynasty, local officials would send the finest combs to the palace. An ivory comb made in Changzhou is still displayed in the Forbidden City. Manufacturing processes Production of Changzhou combs requires special skills and use of dedicated materials. The materials for combs can be bamboo, wood or animal bones. The bamboo is mainly from the south from Jiangsu and the west of Zhejiang. The wood mainly stems from valuable types, such as mahogany wood, jujube wood, heather and boxwood. The production process of a wooden comb () contains 28 steps and a Bi (, a different type of comb, which has more teeth) requires 72 processes. The production of combs is very specific about the carving, painting, heating, engraving, grinding and other processes that are used, and which require traditional crafts. Since Changzhou comb is made with natural materials, they are often used for decorative purposes, while the use is also said to be good for the hair. Honors Changzhou combs have also won many awards. They were first exhibited outside China at the Panama–Pacific International Exposition in 1915, where a Silver Award was received. In the following decades, several prizes were won inside and outside China. Changzhou combs were also presented as gifts of Shanghai World Expo to visitors. In 1926, commemorating the 150th anniversary of the independence of the United States of America, an international exposition was held in Philadelphia, and Changzhou Comb was awarded the gold medal. *The Southern Seas Industries Association () (1910): Gold Medal *Panama–Pacific International Exposition (1915): Silver Medal *The Philadelphia Exposition (1926): Gold Medal *The national light industrial export exhibition (1988): Silver Medal *Beijing International Exposition (1991): Gold Medal References Category:Culture in Jiangsu Category:Chinese culture Category:Hairdressing Category:Changzhou ","title":"Changzhou comb"},{"id":"33174572","text":"Shin Yung-kyoo (born 30 March 1942) is a North Korean football defender who played for North Korea in the 1966 FIFA World Cup.Copa do Mundo da FIFA Inglaterra 1966 He also played for Moranbong Sports Team.

Howard's sword and sorcery hero Conan the Barbarian. It was first published in trade paperback by Tor Books in October 1987, with a regular paperback edition issued simultaneously by the same publisher, and was reprinted in August 1988. A British edition was published in paperback by Orbit Books in January 1990. Plot Conan falls in with Cengh, a priest of the Suddah Oblates, who is conveying a jewel known as the Source of Light back to his temple. Unfortunately, his talisman is coveted by a necromancer, Neg the Malefic, who plans on raising an army of undead warriors with the jewel's magic. When an agent of Neg murders Cengh and steals the jewel, Conan seeks vengeance for his friend. Joining forces with a warrior woman, Elashi, and a beautiful zombie, Tuanne, Conan tracks the murderer back to his master. They overcome numerous menaces on the journey towards Neg's stronghold, including the Men With No Eyes, henchmen of the One With No Name, and a swarm of spiders. Finally, Conan faces and kills Neg himself in a great battle. Chronology Internal evidence indicates that Perry's later Conan work Conan the Indomitable directly follows this novel, though in the comprehensive Conan chronology of William Galen Gray, Sean A. Moore's Conan the Hunter is placed between the two books. Reception Writing on one of Perry's other novels, reviewer Ryan Harvey assessed the author's Conan corpus as \\"goofy,\\" noting that he \\"has a reputation among Conan fandom for overkill and general silliness.\\" Ryan does rate this book above Perry's later novel Conan the Free Lance.Harvey, Ryan. \\"Pastiches 'R' Us: Conan the Free Lance\\" (Review), Jul. 28, 2009.

It is the first in Mexico to focus nearly exclusively on gay community and the issues it faces. The groups as a repertoire of over ten major works including Danza del mal amor o mejor me voy, which has been performed over 100 times. La Cebra has appeared in various locations in Mexico and has had appearances in the United States and France. José Rivera Moya The dance troupe was founded by José Rivera Moya from San Luis Potosí. When Rivera arrived to Mexico City in 1987, there were no gay bars and police action against homosexuals was common. In the capital, Rivera became a dancer with the Ballet Independiente under director Raúl Flores Canelo, who would remain an influence on Rivera's work since. While a dancer with this Ballet, Rivera produced his first work with a homoerotic theme called Danza del mal amor o mejor me voy, first presented in 1990, winning the Concurso Interno de Coreografías of that year. In 1996, Rivera founded La Cebra in Mexico City to focus nearly exclusively on gay themes, becoming his life's work. Rivera readily admits he is not the first choreographer in Mexico to create gay- themed pieces, giving credit to his mentor Flores Canelo as well as to Marco Antonio Silva and Miguel Mancillas. However, he founded La Cebra as the first to focus on gay themes, with much of the works presented by the group based on Rivera's own life as a gay male growing up in Mexican society. The director considers himself a “narrative choreographer” and says that his works say what many young gays “want to scream.” Today, Rivera remains artistic director of the Ballet Independiente and has become a member of the Mexican Society of Choreographers (Sociedad Mexicana de Coreógrafos). History and make up of La Cebra La Cebra Danza Gay was established in 1996 specifically to focus on gay issues, including erotic themes. Rivera's 1990s work, Danza del mal amor o mejor me voy, moved from the Ballet Independiente to become one of the main elements of the new organization's repertoire. In 1998, the group had it first major performance at the XXIII Festival Internacional de Danza “Lilia López” in San Luis Potosí. Since then it has remained active, performing in various parts of Mexico and the United States. As of 2005, Danza del mal amor o mejor me voy had been performed 100 times. In 2010, it collaborated with humorist Alejandro García Villalón of the Nueva Trova Cubana. Today, there are six main dancers José Rivera Moya, Bruno Ramri, Hugo Cruz, Jonathan Villeda, Juan Madero and Jesús Salinas. It is one of very few dance troupes consisting entirely of men, as most are dominated by women. The members of the group are not necessarily homosexual, but the themes it works with almost exclusively are. La Cebra has had guest choreographers such as Rafael Rosales, also from the Ballet Independiente, and Bruno Ramri. The group receives support from the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes, with permanent practice space at the CONACULTA building in Colonia Guerrero in Mexico City. For its 15th anniversary, the troupe performed “Con humo en los ojos y en el corazón” by Uruguayan dancer Dery Fazio. The event also included a “retro” fashion show to support AIDS research. Repertoire and message La Cebra's message and focus remains on the gay community and the issues it faces with some branching out to more general cultural and human rights issues. These include elements such as homoeroticism, violence, minority rights, AIDS, cross-dressing, hate crimes, discrimination, male prostitution and the Catholic's church stance on homosexuality. Ave María Purísima, de prostitución y lentejuelas was created with the dance company in 1996. Yo no soy Pancho Villa ni me gusta el futbol was created in 1998 about the gay nightclub scene in Mexico City. Quinceañera del Bajío mata a sus chambelanes is a criticism of the drug-related violence which plagues Mexico. Oraciones was choreographed by Graciela Henriquez, which traces the roots of Latin American peoples and the religious syncretism that emerged after Spanish and Portuguese conquests. Arcoiris Mambo is a homage to the music of the 1950s, and the movies of Mexico's Golden Age of Cinema. Bailemos a Mozart. Por los ángeles que se han ido was created in 2001 in memory of those who had died of AIDS. El tiempo lo arrasa todo. Queda la muerte was created in 2004 which discusses death and AIDS. Cartas de amor is about people who live with HIV. El soldado y el marinero is a love story. Appearances La Cebra has performed in various parts of Mexico, such as Baja California, Colima and Oaxaca and has made appearances in the United States and Europe. The group performed Bailemos a Mozart, por los angeles at the Palacio de Bellas Artes, the country's most prestigious venue. The group represented Mexico at the X Biennal de la Danse in Lyon, France in 2002. It participated in the X Muestra Internacional de Danza Tijuana in 2008. In 2010, performed at the Feria del Libro y la Rosa in Taxco, sponsored by UNAM, and the Festival Artístico Coahuila . In 2011, they were invited to perform at the Festival Internacional Cervantino, which is significant as Guanajuato is considered one of the most conservative cities in Mexico. For this event, the group opted to perform a work called Ganímedes,” which is based on the Greek myth. It has homoerotic themes and dances who are nude except for body paint.

It was first published in trade paperback by Tor Books in February 1986; a regular paperback edition followed from the same publisher in January 1987, and was reprinted at least once. The first British edition was published in paperback by Sphere Books in January 1988. The book also includes \\"Conan the Indestructible\\", L. Sprague de Camp's chronological essay on Conan's career.Lagomorph Rex. \\"Hyborean Apocrphya: Conan the Fearless\\" (Review), March 12, 2011. Plot Conan finds himself in the Corinthian city of Mornstadinos, after he enlists as a bodyguard defending a magician and Eldia, a girl who has control over fire elementals, against an evil mage named Sovartus. Sovartus is collecting such elemental whisperers and already has the other three. He wants Eldia to complete his set. This brings Conan into conflict with a host of other threats as well, including a demon employed by Sovartus and the witch Djuvula, who happens to be the demon's half-sister, the rich senator Lemparius, who's actually a were-panther, an avaricious thief named Loganaro, and various monsters. Plots and counter-plots build up to a climax at Sovartus' stronghold. Reception Ryan Harvey rates Conan the Fearless above Conan the Free Lance, one of Perry's later Conan novels, in a review of that book. Harvey assesses the author's Conan corpus in general as \\"goofy,\\" noting that he \\"has a reputation among Conan fandom for overkill and general silliness.\\"Harvey, Ryan. \\"Pastiches 'R' Us: Conan the Free Lance\\" (Review), Jul. 28, 2009. \\"This one is pretty good,\\" opines critic Don D'AmmassaD'Ammassa, Don. \\"Conan the Fearless\\" (review on Critical Mass).

Where the analysis is designed to decipher the existence of simple causal motives that are expected to be embedded in the observed complex activity of the networks are noticeable. Many studies have applied the FH analysis to modeled and real networks or complex data (such as recorded brain activity, gene microarray data, antigen microarray data and even financial data) the characteristic geometrical and topological features are deciphered in the complex activity. History The Functional Holography analysis method was first introduced in 2004 by Itai Baruchi and Eshel Ben-Jacob, for analysis of recorded human brain activity. The term hologram stands for “whole”—holo in Greek, plus “information” or “message”—gram in Greek. In a holographic photography, the information describing a 3D object is encoded on a two-dimensional photographic film, ready to be regenerated into a holographic image or hologram. A characteristic feature is the “whole in every part” nature of the process—a small part of the photographic film can generate the whole picture, but with fewer details. Another property is high tolerance to noise and high robustness to lesion: even with many imperfections or with several pixels removed, the image of the object as a whole is still retained in the hologram. To magnify a part of the original 3D object, one needs to produce a new photographic film for the part to be magnified. Another related feature is the holographic superposition—when illuminated together (placed side by side), two holograms can generate a superposition of the corresponding two 3D objects. Superposition of objects can also be made by imprinting the images of the two (or more) 3D objects on the same holographic film. These and other special features of hologram are due to the way the information is encoded on the films—not a direct projection of the picture in real space but in the correlations between the pixels. These are converted back to a picture in three dimensions by proper illumination. The above properties of holograms guided the development and are the rationale behind the functional holography method presented here. The term “functional” is to indicate that the analysis is in the space of functional correlations that serve the analogue role to the long-range correlations imprinted on the photographic film (by the use of the interference of coherent lights). The Functional Holography methodology shares the special features of holograms—tolerance to noise, robustness to lesion, holographic superposition and holographic zooming. Algorithm #Evaluation of the matrix of similarities (correlations) between the activities of the network’s components. #Collective normalization of the similarities – the affinity transformation - to construct a matrix of functional correlations. #The Projection of affinity matrix using dimension reduction algorithms (the Principal Component Analysis, PCA) onto a principal three-dimensional space of the leading eigenvectors computed by the algorithm. #Retrieval of information that is lost in the dimension reduction - the nodes are connected by color- coded lines that represent the level of similarities, which is then used to construct a holographic network in the principal space.

The following parishes and hamlets were within the Chase: Hanley Castle, Upton-upon-Severn, Welland, Longdon, Birtsmorton, Castlemorton, Bromsberrow, Berrow, Malvern, Colwall and Mathon. History In his book The Forest and Chase of Malvern, Edwin Lees describes the origins of the chase. \\"Nothing is stated with certainty as to the ownership of the Forest or Wilderness of Malvern before the reign of Edward I, who granted it as Royal property to Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, and it was henceforth called a Chace. The second Gilbert de Clare married Maude, daughter of John de Burgh, when the Chaces of Malvern and Cors, with the Castle and Manor of Hanley, were assigned her as a dower; but the Earl being killed in the Scottish war, and having no children by Maude, these possessions went after his death to his sisters, as his heirs, and the eldest, who married Hugh le Despencer the younger, brought them with other possessions into the Despencer family, where they remained till in the third generation, then passing by marriage to Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, a renowned general in the reign of Henry V who was killed in the French wars.\\" His son, Henry Beauchamp, created Duke of Warwick by Henry VI., died aged only 22, at Hanley Castle, and was buried in Tewkesbury Abbey. His estates and Malvern Chace among them, as he died without issue, passed to his only sister and heiress, Ann, married to the celebrated Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, the \\"king-maker\\" who leaving two daughters, his were, as heiresses, divided between them. One was matched to the unfortunate Edward, Prince of Wales, son of Henry VI. and Queen Margaret, killed in the rout after at Tewkesbury. She was married afterwards to Richard Duke of Gloucester later King Richard III., and had one son Edward who died aged around ten. The other became the wife of George, Duke of Clarence, who left one son. This son and heir was beheaded in the Tower on pretence of conspiracy by order of Henry VII., who then seized upon all young Warwick's possessions, including the Castle and Manor of Hanley, the parks of Blackmore, Hanley, and Cliffey, all lying in the bosom of the Chace, together with the market town of Upton-upon-Severn; and so these possessions thus unjustly obtained by Henry remained Crown lands till about the year 1630. =Attempted disafforestation and riots= King Charles I engaged in sale of Royal forests and chases during the 1620s and 30s in an attempt to provide himself with income without recourse to Parliament. In 1630 he granted one-third part of the Forest or Chace of Malvern to Sir Robert Heath, then Attorney-General, and Sir Cornelius Vermuyden. In the meantime many rights or claims of right had arisen by grant or long usages in the lapse of several centuries. When the grantees began to enclose, the Chace the commoners and other persons interested disputed their right to do so. Several riots and disturbances took place in consequence. Such riots were common in these processes, elsewhere being known as the Western Rising. Nevertheless a decree was issued in 1632 for the \\"disafforestation of the Chace of Malvern, and for freeing the lands within the bounds, limits, and jurisdictions thereof, of and from the game of deer there and the forest laws.\\" By this decree (to obviate all disputes) one-third part only was to be severed and divided by commissioners, but the other two parts \\"shall remain and continue unto and amongst the commoners, and be held by them according to their several rights and interests, discharged and freed from his Majesty's game of deer there, and of and from the forest laws, and the liberties and franchises of Forest and Chace, in such sort as by the said decree it doth and may appear.\\" Further disputes with landowners resulted in clarifications that any land that was disafforested had to be in proportion to the quality of the land as a whole, so that the common was not the most meagre land. Legal status after 1660 King Charles II confirmed the settlement. Commissioners were to judge any further requests for encroachments. The Chace was gradually eroded until the 1800s, when campaigners and renewed interest in the Malvern Hills resulted in the Malvern Hills Act 1884 which appointed Malvern Hills Conservators to preserve the area and govern its land use.

Maria Maksakova, the three times laureate of the Stalin's Prize (1946, 1949, 1951), was designated as a People's Artist of the USSR in 1971. The actress Lyudmila Maksakova is her daughter; singer and TV presenter Maria Maksakova Jr. her granddaughter. Biography Maria Sidorova was born in Astrakhan, one of six children of Pyotr Sidorov, the executive director of the Volga Shipping company. After her father's death, ten-year-old Maria joined a local church choir to help her 27-year-old mother sustain a family. It was there that her vocal abilities were first noticed. Sidorova engaged herself in intensive self-education and a year later became a lead in the alto section of the choir, with which she stayed until 1917. In late 1917, Sidorova joined the Astrakhan musical college to study the piano. She had no instrument at home, and had to stay at school to practise literally day and night. In the early 1918, she started studying vocal, originally as contralto. Regarded as one of the best in the class, she was often sent on obligatory 'tours' to sing for the Red Army soldiers and sailors. \\"I enjoyed success and was extremely proud of it\\", she later wrote. One of her tutors, Smolenskaya, started to train Sidorova as soprano, which Sidorova greatly enjoyed. \\"With her I studied for a year. Then the Astrakhan theatre was moved to Tsaritsyn and I decided to join its troupe, so as to go on studying with my pedagogue,\\" she later recalled. \\"[Maksakova] mastered a professional vocal range, demonstrating flawless precision in intonations and perfect sense of rhythm. What was most attractive in the young singer's performances was her musical and verbal expressiveness, her total involvement with the lyrics\\", wrote Mikhail Lvov in his 1947 biography. =Success= In summer 1919 Sidorovamade her theatre debut as Olga in Evgeny Onegin. In the autumn the famous baritone Maximilian Maksakov joined the theatre as a new director (and soloist) and gave her several new roles, including those in Faust and Rigoletto. Admiring the girl's gift, but seeing flaws in her technique, the maestro sent her to Petrograd for further studying. There she met Alexander Glazunov, was consulted by another professor who recognized a lyrical soprano in her, and then returned, to ask Maksakov for private lessons. The two became close, he proposed, and in 1920 they married, forming a sparkling duet on stage. In 1923 Maksakova came to Moscow, debuted (as Amneris, in Aida, as a last moment substitute for Nadezhda Obukhova, who fell ill) at the Bolshoi Theatre, and was invited to join the star-studded troupe. Sergey Lemeshev in his memoirs revived the moment when a petite girl entered the stage, making young actors occupying the gallery wonder: could this be Amneris, or perhaps her young servant? Snegurochka \\"Even then Maksakova fascinated us with her special way with words. Not only clear and crisp was her diction, but she got this dramatic expressiveness of phrase charged with inner strife of passion and jealousy. Besides, Amneris was enchantingly feminine\\", Lemeshev added. Maximilian and Maria Maksakovs moved to Moscow and settled at Dmitrovka Street, in a communal flat. \\"[Max] turned his young wife's life into hard labour. Each day a home practice, with tears; then a performance in the evening, late at night – lots of scolding with more tears ... He was 33 years older but not for a moment did she come to regret those 15 years she spent with him\\", daughter Lyudmila Maksakova remembered. Two of the theatre's stars provided inspiration for the young singer. \\"Watching the art of Nezhdanova and Sobinov ... I was beginning to realize for the first time that even great masters, in order to elevate their character to peaks of expressiveness have to expose their inner exaltation in the most stark, transparent ways; that hidden riches of an artist's inner world should come hand in hand with economy in outward movement\\", she wrote in autobiography. In 1925 Maksakova moved to Leningrad's Mariinsky Theatre where she sang parts in Orpheus, Khovanschina (Marfa) and Red Petrograd by Gladkovsky and Prussak (Comrade Dasha), among many others. In 1927 she returned to the Bolshoi, where she remained a leading soloist until her retirement 1953. She sang most of the leading female parts in the theater's classic repertoire, including Carmen, Marina Mnishek, Aksinya in The Quiet Don and Charlotte in Werther. In Gluck's Orfeo Maksakova featured as both a soloist and a co-director. She regularly embarked upon extensive concert tours, travelling all over the country with a repertoire which included famous arias, songs by the Soviet composers and her own interpretations of classic songs and romances by Tchaikovsky, Schubert and others. Maksakova, who was one of the first Soviet artists who in the mid-1930s received permission to perform abroad, and gave successful concerts in Turkey and Poland, later Sweden and (after the war) East Germany. In 1936 Maximilian Maksakov died. Half a year later Maria married Yakov Davtyan, but this marriage did not last long. One night her husband, then a Soviet ambassador in Poland, was taken away by the secret police never to be seen or heard of again. Despite insinuations concerning Joseph Stalin's 'special attention' towards the famous singer (the Soviet dictator, who treated Bolshoi as a 'court troupe', allegedly referred to Maksakova as \\"my Carmen\\") she spent the late 1930s waiting for her arrest. In 1940 Maksakova gave birth to daughter Lyudmila. She never revealed the identity of her father, not even to her daughter. Lyudmila Maksakova remembered: \\"Many years later a Moscow Art Theatre actor whom I met at the Morocco Film festival revealed to me the name of my father: Aleksander Volkov, the singer with the Bolshoi. 'Your father did not want to live in the USSR, he crossed the frontline and soon in the USA opened an opera and drama school,' this man told me. It was only then that I saw the reasons behind my mother's fear – not for herself, but for me, her only daughter.\\"According to Lyudmila's daughter, Maria Maksakova Jr., there are two versions as to her father's identity. \\"One is that it was Aleksander Volkov, the Bolshoi Theater baritone, a descendant from Volkov the Yaroslavl theater founder. Another, that it was Vasily Novikov, Viktor Abakumov's first deputy in SMERSH, a bright, handsome and talented man. Mother prefers the first one, me – the second,\\" she told Komsomolskaya Pravda in 2009. - http://kp.ru/daily/24399/576193/. According to Lyudmila Maksakova, Volkov once came to their house to see the newborn, doubted his \\"authorship\\", and Maria, outraged, never wanted to see him again. - ... Когда я родилась, он пришел на меня взглянуть. Мама была оскорблена тем, что, увидев меня, он усомнился в своем \\"авторстве\\". Этим он подписал приговор их отношениям... As the war was coming to an end, things for Maria Maksakova started to look brighter. In 1944 she won the 1st Prize at the Russian Folk song competition held by the Arts Committee of the USSR. In 1946 she received her first Stalin Prize \\"for the outstanding achievements in opera and the performing arts.\\" Two more were to come, in 1949 and 1951. =Retirement and death= Maria Maksakova's grave at the Vvedenskoye Cemetery In 1953 Maksakova received the notification of her 'retirement'. This came as an unpleasant surprise for the singer felt she was in superb shape, both physically and artistically. Rumours had it, some people at the Bolshoi decided to settle some old scores this way, now that Stalin, her much-feared patron, was now dead, and the name of Vera Davydova, another famous Soviet soprano, has been mentioned in this context. Lyudmila Maksakova refused to believe this, remembering the times when Davydova, who lived in a neighbouring dacha, helped her mother in difficult times. Davydova herself remembered her great rival with warmth. \\"Maria Petrovna paid great attention to the way she looked. She was beautiful and had excellent figure. Yet she kept herself perfectly fit, with strict diet and regular gymnastics ... Our relations were pure and friendly, each respected and valued what the other was doing on stage,\\" Davydova maintained. After her retirement from the Bolshoi, Maksakova joined Nikolay Osipov's Russian Folk orchestra as a soloist. In 1956 the Bolshoi invited Maksakova back, but her return was a one-off: she performed as Carmen, just to say farewell to her fans. In her later years Maksakova taught vocals at the Russian Academy of Theatre Arts (where she for many years held the position of a docent), was the head of the Folk vocal school in Moscow, published articles and essays. She was the driving force behind the opening of the Conservatory in her native Astrakhan. Among her protégés was Tamara Milashkina, later an acclaimed singer on her own right. In 1971 she was designated as a People's Artist of the USSR. When daughter Lyudmila called her mother to bring the news, the reply was: \\"So what? Now all this doesn't matter.\\" Maria Petrovna Maksakova died in Moscow on August 11, 1974. She was buried at the Vvedenskoye Cemetery.

Grimditch went on to place fourth in ABC's World Superstars competition. \\"Winning the Superstars was one my greatest emotional highs,\\" Grimditch said. The Superstars multi-sport training regimen may have altered Grimditch's water skiing career, however, and injuries associated with participation in Superstars would limit his contributions to the sport on the water in subsequent years. Grimditch moved to television color commentary to give analysis of water skiing events after his skiing career was concluded. Trademarked water skis and helmets bore his name, he provided consulting advice to ski and boat manufacturing companies to provide guidance in the sports' development, and it was said that half of the skiers competing in national competitions in the late 1970s used skis based on his designs. Since leaving the water skiing field, Grimditch began his own fitness company in Florida.

The IRP provides independent scientific assessments and expert advice on a variety of areas, including: • the volume of selected raw material reserves and how efficiently these resources are being used • the lifecycle- long environmental impacts of products and services created and consumed around the globe • options to meet human and economic needs with fewer or cleaner resources.  About the report  The report considered the amount of resources currently being consumed by humanity and analysed how that would likely increase with population growth and future economic development. Its scenarios showed that by 2050 humans could use triple the amount of minerals, ores, fossil fuels and biomass annually – 140 billion tonnes per year – unless the rate of resource consumption could be decoupled from that of economic growth. Developed country citizens currently consume as much as 25 tonnes of those four key resources each year, while the average person in India consumes four tonnes annually. Another billion middle-class are set to emerge as developing countries rapidly became industrialised.Rising resource use threatens future growth, warns UN, Mark Kinver, BBC News, 12 May 2011 The report explains that decoupling is not about stopping growth. Rather, it is about doing more with less. There is evidence that decoupling is already under way; world gross domestic product grew by a factor of 23 in the 20th century, while resource use rose by a factor of eight. However, this will not be enough to avoid meeting resource scarcity and severe environmental limits. Resource use may ultimately need to fall to between five and six tonnes per person annually.World must curb resource use; China a test case: U.N., Alister Doyle, Reuters 12 May 2011 Recycling, re-use and greater efficiency can all help achieve decoupling. It showed that decoupling might be a good strategy for economic growth in developing countries to avoid becoming resource intensive economies in the future.

She is currently music director of the Chicago Sinfonietta and conductor laureate of the Memphis Symphony Orchestra. Early life and education A native of Taiwan, Chen wanted to be a conductor since she was ten years old. At a young age she began playing violin and piano with the support of her parents, and later taught herself to play the trumpet. However, Chen's parents also discouraged her from pursuing conducting as they felt it would be a difficult career path for a woman. She was intrigued with the concept of making elaborate noise, particularly without the use of an instrument. Chen would observe her conductor closely and began to learn how to conduct on her own. She collected batons, believing that \\"different pieces needed different kinds of batons\\". Chen left Kaohsiung to study music in Taipei, where she lived with her aunt and served as assistant conductor of her school's chorus. In 1989, Chen attended a concert in Taipei by the American Youth Orchestra, a touring ensemble of Boston's New England Conservatory. Following the performance, Chen's accompanist escorted her backstage, introduced her to the conductor, and asked if she could play for him. Chen's opportunity came the next morning when she played for conductor Benjamin Zander in a closed basement hotel bar and was offered a scholarship immediately. She performed with the American Youth Orchestra before being invited to attend the Walnut Hill School, a preparatory school linked to the New England Conservatory, two months later at age sixteen. She left her parents, who thought she would study to become a concert violinist, and for more than three years lived with a couple in Boston she referred to as her \\"American parents\\" (Mark Churchill and Marylou Speaker Churchill, who was once a member of the Portland Junior Symphony). Chen continued her undergraduate and graduate work at the Conservatory. Speaker taught Chen, who also received violin instruction from James Buswell and Eric Rosenblith as well as conducting supervision from Frank Battisti and Richard Hoenich. Chen became the first person to graduate from the New England Conservatory with a double master's degree in conducting and violin performance and received two honors from the institution: the Chadwick Medal for outstanding undergraduate work, and the Schuller Medal for \\"extraordinary contribution to musical life in the community\\". Later in her career, in October 2010, Chen returned to the New England Conservatory to guest conduct the Philharmonia. Chen dedicated the concert to the late Marylou Speaker Churchill, and thanked Benjamin Zander and dean emeritus Mark Churchill for \\"making her career possible\\". Chen remained in Boston for nine years until she attended the University of Michigan to obtain a Doctor of Musical Arts degree in conducting. There she studied with Kenneth Kiesler and Martin Katz, served as music director of the campus orchestras, and also became conductor for the Arbor Opera Theater. Chen said she pursued the doctorate degree because she did not receive any job offers and she questioned whether that was due to her being \\"young, a woman, Asian, or the combination of all three.\\" Career In 2001, Chen was the youngest finalist in the Maazel-Vilar Conductor's Competition in Tokyo. In 2002, Leonard Slatkin invited Chen to conduct the National Symphony at the Kennedy Center in the National Conducting Institute. Chen received a fellowship to study at the Aspen Music Festival and School with David Zinman. The following year the American Symphony Orchestra League (now known as the League of American Orchestras) invited Chen to be showcased at the National Conductor Preview. =Portland Youth Philharmonic= Chen became the Portland Youth Philharmonic's (PYP) fourth conductor in 2002 after being selected by a committee of \\"musically inclined\\" parents, a member of the orchestra, and representatives of the Oregon Symphony and Portland Opera. She conducted both the Philharmonic ensemble as well as the Conservatory Orchestra. One of the organization's board member's recalled that during her audition Chen very quickly captured the rapport of the orchestra and displayed \\"wonderful communication skills and genuineness\\". During her five-year tenure with the organization, PYP debuted at Carnegie Hall, received its third ASCAP award in 2004 for innovating programming, and began collaborating with the Oregon Symphony (Chen was the ensemble's assistant conductor from 2003 to 2005) and Chamber Music Northwest. In April 2005, Chen became the first woman to win the Malko Competition, the \\"world's most prestigious prize\\" for young conductors. She also won the Taki Concordia Fellowship in 2007, an award established by Baltimore Symphony Orchestra music director Marin Alsop to support \\"promising\\" female conductors. Chen was presented the Sunburst Award from Young Audiences for her contribution to music education and was named \\"Educator of the Week\\" by KKCW. While conductor of the Philharmonic, Chen set up a box in her office so that students could leave notes for her about themselves. One musician in the orchestra felt that Chen was \\"kind of formal\\" during rehearsal but felt \\"like a big sister\\" once practice ended. Chen has been described as a \\"firecracker: small, bright and full of ka-boom\\", and her enthusiasm at times caused her to lose her breath. One of the organization's board members praised Chen's attitude and felt that her lack of ego was a \\"rare quality in top symphony performers\\". Chen turned down a position with the Oregon Symphony to continue work at PYP, later recalling: In 2007, she accompanied the orchestra on an international tour to Asia, where her parents saw her conduct for the first time. The Philharmonic offered a total of six performances between June 29 and July 17 in Kaohsiung, Tainan and Taipei, Taiwan as well as in Seoul and Ulsan, South Korea. Though Chen initially thought she would remain with the Philharmonic for ten years, she left in 2007 to become assistant conductor of the Atlanta Symphony. She said of her departure: \\"The musicians at PYP have become my kids. When I look back, these five years will always be the most memorable time of my musical career.\\" Guest conductors during the 2007–2008 season included Ken Selden, director of orchestral studies at Portland State University, former Seattle Symphony conductor Alastair Willis, along with former PYP conductors Huw Edwards and Chen herself. =Baltimore, Memphis, Chicago= Chen served as the Los Angeles Philharmonic's cover conductor during her tenure with PYP. Following her departure, she became assistant conductor of the Atlanta Symphony for two seasons (2007–2009). In April 2009 Chen withdrew her candidacy for music director of the Lexington Philharmonic Orchestra. Her next role was assistant conductor of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra for the 2009–2010 season, though she never led a subscription program and mostly conducted programs for children. Both positions were sponsored by the League of American Orchestras. In February 2010, the Memphis Symphony Orchestra named Chen its music director, effective with the 2010-2011 season, the first woman to hold the post. Chen's three-year tenure began in September 2010. Chen's contract was renewed for an additional three years in 2012, extending her leadership through the 2015–2016 season. During her Memphis tenure, she took up residence in Mud Island, Memphis. Chen concluded her tenure with the orchestra in 2016, and now has the title of conductor laureate of the orchestra. Chen became music director of the Chicago Sinfonietta on 1 July 2011, with an initial contract of 4 years. Chen has recorded a commercial album with the Sinfonietta released on May 28, 2013, entitled Delights & Dances, on the Çedille label. In May 2014, the Chicago Sinfonietta extended her initial contract through the 2016-2017 season. In May 2016, the orchestra further extended Chen's contract through the 2018-2019 season. In December 2015, Musical America named Chen one of its 2015 \\"Top 30 Influencers\\". Chen served as Artistic Director and Conductor for the 2016 National Taiwan Symphony Orchestra Summer Festival. Interests Musically, Chen finds satisfaction in \\"loud\\" and \\"elaborate\\" noises, particularly ones generated without musical instruments. Her favorite composer is Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky; other favorites include Ludwig van Beethoven, Leonard Bernstein, and Aaron Copland. Her favorite composition is Beethoven's Symphony No. 5, which she conducted during Chicago Sinfonietta's 2011–2012 season. She likes Romantic music the most \\"because the music in this era was an expression of your life\\". In addition to working with minority or unconventional artists, Chen prefers to incorporate classic compositions as well as new works into her repertoire. As a child Chen was interested in earth science. She enjoys reading detective stories, fiction or non-fiction, and has shared that she would want to be a detective or a professor if she were not a conductor.

Others purchase overstocks and closeout merchandise from retailers or distributors. Their clients are the resellers that purchase those stocks and sell it to the final consumers. Often, this process is financed through merchant factoring or vendor finance. In other cases, the merchant is assessed \\"counter rent\\" for a \\"store-within-a- store\\" concept, common in the cosmetics industry, but also not unheard of in clothing. In other cases, the vendor agrees to buy back unsold merchandise from the retailer -- this is a common arrangement for higher-value seasonal clothing, like designer coats.  Wholesale businesses  Many intermediaries exist to assure product quality or to hold stocks until needed by retailers who often have limited storage and retail space; they also help smaller retailers avoid issues like customs bonding and the need to secure an import license. The distributor sells large quantities of clothing stocks to a reseller, who tries to charge sufficient mark-ups to cover his costs and still make a profit. Often the supply chain will include more than one intermediary, although retailers usually strive for the fewest middlemen and lowest prices. Since the emergence of the Internet, many retailers have begun using it for just this purpose, and many new online-only wholesalers have emerged as a result.  Risks  Business always involves risk, especially in a market strongly controlled by powerful fashion houses and manufacturers at one end and fickle consumers at the other, where global supply chains and the seasonality of clothing often mean that clothing must be bought months or a year in advance and credit, transportation and warehousing arranged on tight deadlines. Producers are the ones that set up the apparel stocks starting prices and consumers are the ones that choose to buy or not a product sold at a certain price. Despite increasingly sophisticated tools like computer modelling for measuring and predicting consumer behavior and tweaking price and promotional activity, retailers can never be entirely certain of their sell through rate or the average price realized. Retailers hedge risk by seeking vendor financing or vendor buy-back arrangements as mentioned above, which distributes some of the risk of unsold merchandise back up the supply chain to the producer or wholesaler; they also open alternate channels such as outlet stores to liquidate unsold merchandise while freeing up floor space for new arrivals. Some \\"fast fashion\\" retailers, like Zara attempt to control their whole supply chain from design to production to the retail store, in order to practice just in time production, or something close to it; in cases of complete integration, there is no \\"wholesale fashion distribution,\\" as the retailer is its own manufacturer and wholesaler.  Related concepts  A related concept is drop shipping, a commercial process used in direct-to- consumer marketing. A drop-shipper relies on a third party, like an online fashion blog to generate consumer interest and initiate an electronic order that is sent to the drop shipper's warehouse for fulfillment. The profits are split between the drop shipper and the nominal seller at a pre-arranged rate, usually involving a commission structure. Because only the drop shipper has physical facilities, the notional online \\"retailer\\" faces much lower costs. This allows consumers to realize prices closer to the wholesale level, but it disadvantages retailers who lose control over many aspects of customer service, discounting, packaging etc. See also *Wholesale marketing References External links * The New York Times Category:Freight transport Fashion ","title":"Wholesale fashion distribution"},{"id":"33175021","text":"Adamant is a 2011 short film directed by Giacomo Mantovani.

Pluristem Therapeutics is an Israeli company engaged in the development of human placental adherent stromal cells for commercial use in disease treatment. According to the company's website, it extracts adult stem cells exclusively from postnatal placentas. Corporate history Pluristem was founded in 2001 by Shai Meretzki of the Technion, who made use of a stem cell patent which was developed during his Ph.D studies at The Rappaport Faculty Of Medicine, Technion, under the supervision of Dr. Shosh Merchav, together with Professors Dov Zipori and Avinoam Kadouri from the Weizmann Institute of Science. In 2003, the NASDAQ-listed shell company A1 Software acquired all shares and patents belonging to Pluristem and changed its name to Pluristem Life Systems. In 2007 the name was changed again, this time to Pluristem Therapeutics Inc. Pluristem's shares are traded on the NASDAQ exchange and the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, as well as on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. In 2007 Pluristem entered into a collaborative research agreement with the Charité medical school in Berlin for a period of five years. In 2012 Pluristem announced that the agreement had been renewed until 2017. Pluristem was awarded an NIS9 million (US$2.4 million) grant from the Office of the Chief Scientist of Israel in January 2012. In April of the same year the company announced the receipt of an additional grant from the Chief Scientist, this time of NIS11.8 million (US$3.2 million). In August 2016, Europe's Horizon 2020 Program awarded Pluristem an $8 million grant to cover a portion of its expenses in Europe for Pluristem's Phase III study of PLX-PAD cells in the treatment of critical limb ischemia. In 2016, The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gavePluristem Therapeutics, the go-ahead to move forward with its innovative treatment approach for hematopoietic disorders. Products Pluristem is in the process of clinically testing the use of its PLX (PLacental eXpanded) cells in Phase I, Phase II and Phase III trials. A Phase III trial of PLX-(PAD)-peripheral arterial disease cells in the treatment of critical limb ischemia has been cleared to start enrolling patients by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The Phase III trial has also been cleared by regulators in Germany and the United Kingdom. Pluristem has completed enrollment of 172 patients in January 2017 for a multinational Phase II clinical trial of its PLX-PAD treatment pertaining to intermittent claudication. Top line results are expected early in 2018. On October 27, 2014, it was reported that Case Western Reserve University will conduct a preclinical study of PLX-R18 cells in umbilical cord blood transplants for the treatment of blood cancers and genetic diseases. Results from the study suggest that PLX-R18 is safe and may significantly improve outcomes after bone marrow failure or hematopoietic cell transplantation. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has also cleared Pluristem to commence patient enrollment in a Phase I trial of its PLX-R18 cells to treat insufficient hematopoietic recovery following bone marrow transplant. PLX-R18 were initially developed with Professor Raphael Gorodetsky at Hadassah Hospital for the treatment of acute radiation syndrome and enhancement of bone marrow regeneration. The U.S. National Institutes of Health is currently evaluating Pluristem's PLX-R18 cells as a treatment for acute radiation syndrome. The dose finding portion of the study was successfully concluded and data showed that PLX-R18 treated subjects had an 85% survival rate compared to the placebo group which had a 50% survival rate. PLX-R18 can serve as a tool for governments to protect their citizens against potential exposure to nuclear radiation. The USFDA has conferred orphan drug status on Pluristem's PLX cells for the treatment of Buerger's disease (2011) and aplastic anemia (2013). Human applications In May 2012, Pluristem reported that its experimental PLacental eXpanded cells were injected into the muscles of a 7-year-old Romanian girl undergoing treatment for bone marrow aplasia disease at the Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem. The girl had undergone two allogenic stem cell transplants since being admitted in August 2011, both of which failed to improve her condition. Two months thereafter, with the patient's condition deteriorating rapidly, the Director of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Cell Therapy and Transplantation Research Center at Hadassah felt that all available options had been exhausted and turned to Pluristem's PLX cells. The Helsinki committee at Israel's Ministry of Health approved the procedure under compassionate use. According to Pluristem CEO Zami Aberman, it was the first time ever that stem cells were injected into the muscle rather than into the body's blood system. Pluristem announced that the treatment led to a significant increase in the girl's red cells, white cells and platelets, effecting a reverse in her condition. She was released from the hospital soon after Pluristem's announcement. In September 2012 Pluristem reported saving the life of a third bone marrow disease patient using its PLacental eXpanded cell treatment, again at Jerusalem's Hadassah Medical Center and again under the terms of compassionate use. The 45-year-old patient suffered from acute myeloid leukemia and pancytopenia, and his condition was determined to be life-threatening. After two intramuscular injections of Pluristem's PLX cells, the patient's condition improved significantly and he was released from the hospital. This event has been used as a supporting reference to the medical potential of the PLX cells. In January 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave Pluristem Therapeutics, the go-ahead to move forward with its innovative treatment approach for hematopoietic disorders. Pluristem was given permission to begin its Phase I trial of PLX-R18 cells to treat incomplete hematopoietic recovery following Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation. The clinical trial is expected to begin in the coming months. Later in 2016, Pluristem announced it had partnered with Japan's Fukushima Medical University to test its placental- derived cellular therapy for radiation treatment and has been asked to join the United States National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases program. In 2020 Pluristem began treating COVID-19 patients with placenta cells known as PLX.https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-company-hopes-to- treat-coronavirus-patients-with-placenta-cells/ On May 8, 2020 the United States Food and Drug Administration aporoved Pluristem's application to conduct a Phase II study of its PLX cells (as described by HospiMedica.com \\"PLX cells are allogeneic mesenchymal-like cells that have immunomodulatory properties that induce the immune system’s natural regulatory T cells and M2 macrophages, and thus may prevent or reverse the dangerous overactivation of the immune system.

A three-period division of time appears in the Babylonian Talmud: the period before the giving of the law (Torah); the period subject to the law; and the period of the Messiah. This scheme was later adapted to Christian use, with three periods corresponding to the persons of the Trinity. In that form it was taken up by Joachim of Fiore;Lloyd S. Kramer, Lloyd Kramer, Sarah C. Maza, Sarah Maza, A Companion to Western Historical Thought (2006), p. 83; Google Books. it had been held in a similar form a little earlier by the Amalricians. After the Protestant Reformation the scheme of the \\"prophecy of Elias\\" was popularised by Philip Melanchthon and his Lutheran collaborators, using Carion's Chronicle as a vehicle, heavily edited into due form. The three periods were 'without the law', 'under law', and 'under grace'.G. J. R. Parry, A Protestant Vision: William Harrison and the Reformation of Elizabethan England (2002), p. 97; Google Books With each period attributed a length of two millennia, the scheme was applied to predict the end of time (or at least the commencement of a final seventh millennium). This was done by Johann Heinrich Alsted in the 17th century.Howard Hotson, Paradise Postponed: Johann Heinrich Alsted and the birth of Calvinist millenarianism (2000), p. 52; Google Books The scheme was widely influential in its tripartite structure, seen also in the chronology of Achilles Pirmin Gasser.Robert S.

Portuguese tram routes are typically, but not necessarily, tourist attractions. Tramways are usually embedded in the older parts of Portuguese cities. They are intended primarily for carrying passengers, and as a means of rapid transportation, since the trams usually have priority over the remaining traffic. Trams came to Portugal in the following sequence: Porto (1895), Lisbon (1901), Sintra (1904), Coimbra (1911) and Braga (1914). The first three of these networks are still in operation; the remaining two have been closed.  Lisbon  Lisbon tram. The \\"amarelos da Carris\\" (English:Yellows of the Rails) are a symbol of Lisbon, plying the narrow streets, steep and winding. The Lisbon tramway network is operated by Carris. It presently comprises 5 lines, and has a total length of in gauge, of which is on reserved tracks. Carris employs 165 brakemen (conductors of trams), funiculars and an elevator (the Santa Justa lift) and a runs a fleet of 57 tram vehicles (39 historical, 10 articulated trams and 8 light rail cars), based at a single depot - Santo Amaro.  Porto  The tramway network in the city of Porto is operated by Sociedade de Transportes Colectivos do Porto (STCP). There are three different Porto tram routes: *Line 1: Passeio Alegre//Infante *Line 18: Massarelos// Carmo *Line 22: Circular Carmo//Batalha The STCP tram fleet is housed at the Massarelos depot next to the STCP Tram Museum.  Sintra  Sintra open tram 7 The Sintra tramway is a seasonal narrow gauge interurban tram line. It links the town of Sintra, some north-west of Lisbon, with the Atlantic coast at Praia das Maçãs, a distance of some . As of 2014, the line runs Friday to Sunday in summer months. The line opened in 1904 and originally linked Sintra railway station and Praia das Maçãs. Winter service ended in 1953, and the line continued to run as a summer only service until 1974, when it closed. Service resumed over a short stretch near the coast in 1980, and service has been extended back to Sintra in several sections over the intervening years.  Coimbra  Coimbra saw its first tram circulating in the streets on 10 November 1911. For decades, with more or fewer lines, the tram was an efficient way to move citizens around Coimbra. Although in this period there was not environmental awareness in its present form, trams were a means of non-polluting transport that allowed Coimbra have an air quality unmatched today. Nevertheless, in the late 1970s the trams were considered to be old fashioned, noisy and uncomfortable. Politicians and others were then promoting their rapid decline with the closing of the different lines. The last tram circulated in Coimbra on 9 January 1980.  Braga  The Braga tramway network opened on 5 October 1914, replacing the old Braga horsecar network. It consisted of two routes: *Line 1: Estação caminho de ferro (English: Railway station) to Elevador do Bom Jesus; *Line 2: Largo do Monte de Arcos to Parque da Ponte. The network was finally closed in 1963, and replaced by the Braga trolleybus system. The tracks remained in place until the 1980s.

His images of postwar London went unrecognised until 2011 when knowledge of his work reached the British Library’s curator of visual arts, John Falconer. Though Joseph had always been doubtful of his ability, his stepdaughter had been eager to bring his work into the public eye for some time, and through a friend Falconer found out that she was still in possession of a collection of Joseph's negatives. Of the eighty surviving images, thirty were displayed for the first time in an exhibition at London's British Library between July and September 2011 as part of the London Street Photography Festival.  Personal life  Walter Felix Abraham Joseph was born in Darmstadt, Germany in 1922 to an Orthodox Jewish couple. In 1939, he was forced to flee Germany, followed closely by his twin brothers, and was interned in Mooragh Internment Camp in Ramsey on the Isle of Man for the interim of the Second World War. He ended up settling in London, where he worked in the photographic laboratories of a newspaper while also avidly pursuing his own photography at a semi-professional level. Despite Joseph’s lack of confidence in his photographic skills, his family members were always keen proponents of his work and played a crucial role in gaining him belated recognition.  Photography  Joseph took the majority of his photographs in the streets of London’s East End, providing a unique and poignant vision of the postwar city through the eyes of a German refugee. An article in The Independent characterises the appeal of Joseph’s work as such: :The period – and the people – remain a fascination to us. How often do we invoke the Blitz spirit that saw them through the years that extended beyond the war – more often than not, comically bathetically so? It is to this preoccupation that these photographs speak, offering an everyman's view of subjects from street traders to entertainers. Joseph’s work was publicly displayed for the first time as part of the London Street Photography Festival in an exhibit entitled \\"Walter Joseph: Street Markets of London in the 1940s\\", which ran in the British Library from 1 July 2011 until 12 September 2011. The thirty images in the exhibit were taken between 1947 and 1948 and featured an assortment of London markets, street traders, and entertainers. Since the festival, Joseph's family has made a limited number of his prints available for purchase by the general public. = Exhibition of Joseph's work = * 2011: British Library, London  References  Category:Photographers from Hesse Category:Photographers from London Category:Jewish emigrants from Nazi Germany to the United Kingdom Category:People from Darmstadt Category:1922 births Category:2003 deaths Category:People interned in the Isle of Man during World War II ","title":"Walter Joseph"},{"id":"33175194","text":"Kırmızıdam is a village in the District of Yumurtalık, Adana Province, Turkey.

The song has become a standard of the genres. It has been recorded many times, by artists such as The Carter Family, Bill Monroe, Elvis Presley, the Oak Ridge Boys, B. B. King, and John Fogerty.  History  One version of the song is credited to Lillian Bowles and Winifred O. Hoyle, though it existed as a traditional folk song for longer than that, likely a negro spiritual of indeterminate origin. An early version of the song was collected in a 1929 book, Old Songs Hymnal by Dorothy G. Bolton; the song is described as having a calypso feel to it, leading to speculation that it may have originated in Florida or the Caribbean. The song became popularly associated with Southern gospel music when The Carter Family recorded in 1934 for Bluebird Records; this version is copyrighted to A. P. Carter. Bill Monroe, the father of bluegrass music, added it to his regular set-list due to numerous requests from fans, and because he appreciated the construction metaphor in the song's lyrics. It is believed that the Carter version was itself based on a much older version which the folklorist John Wesley Work III later included in his 1940 collection American Negro Songs and Spirituals. Blues legend B. B. King first learned the song as a young street musician, and it became a regular part of his repertoire during his early career. John Fogerty included the song in his first solo project, The Blue Ridge Rangers.

The movie was written and directed by Kōji Shiraishi.3:AM Magazine, \\"If You Want Blood (You’ve Got It): An Interview with Koji Shiraishi,\\" by David F. Hoenigman (November 29th, 2009 - retrieved on September 23rd, 2011). Plot In 2005, a man named Ken Matsuki kills two people and injures a third at a Japanese resort called Myogasaki. Following the act, Matsuki jumps off a nearby cliff and his body is never found. Three years later, a documentary film crew led by Koji Shiraishi begin a project chronicling the aftermath of the incident and interview several survivors. One of them is the injured victim, Shohei Eno, an unemployed man who had a strange petroglyph-like symbol carved into his back by Matsuki. Eno claims to have experienced frequent paranormal occurrences, including UFO sightings and disembodied voices, since the incident. He also states that he doesn't blame Matsuki for the stabbing; in fact, he is thankful that Matsuki said to him that \\"it is your turn\\", which he interprets as a command that Eno fulfill a \\"ceremony\\" mandated by God, as had been done by Matsuki. Seeing that Eno is financially troubled, the crew agree to pay him on the condition that they are allowed to film the occurrences, which Eno calls \\"miracles\\". Shiraishi's crew come to be repulsed by Eno, especially since they think that he will follow Matsuki's path of mass murder. From Matsuki's father, the crew learns that Eno's symbol resembles the birthmark possessed by Matsuki since childhood. Their search brings them to Kutoro Rock (九頭呂岩, literally \\"Nine-Headed Spine Rock\\"), a formation at the peak of Mount Ohiruyama, where Shiraishi had a bizarre experience five years previously in which he found nine leeches biting his left leg. There, the crew find a stone with Matsuki and Eno's petrogylph symbols inscribed on it. According to a horror film director, Kiyoshi Kurosawa, Kutoro Rock was dedicated to Hiruko, a Japanese god with the form of leech. Meanwhile, the film Eno shoots following his daily routine reveals a number of leech-like apparitions in the skies above Tokyo. Shiraishi takes Eno to a Korean barbecue restaurant to get him to talk openly about what the voices tell him to do. Drunk and relaxed, Eno reveals that he has been saving ¥700,000 to build a bomb so he can commit a suicide bombing in a busy street in Shibuya, which he claims would send him and his victims to God's realm. Shiraishi resolves to stop Eno, but on the way home, he sees Eno's head surrounded by the leach-like apparitions and find his leg bleeding as it did when the leaches bit it. He reluctantly agrees to cooperate, intending to record Eno's plot for other people to identify. After spending a day with Eno prior to the bombing, Eno offers him a ¥100 coin to repay one he borrowed long before. Shiraishi asks him to later return it and the camera from the realm he expects to go to with the bombing. The blast ends up claiming 108 lives, including Shinobu Kuribayashi, a member of Shiraishi's film crew. Eno's body, like Matsuki, is never found. Shiraishi, meanwhile, is sentenced to prison for complicity. 21 years later, Shiraishi is released from prison and reunites with his producer. They return to the Korean barbecue, where Eno's camera and the ¥100 coin he borrowed years previously fall from the ceiling. The footage inside the camera shows Eno being sent immediately after the bombing to a Lovecraftian-like universe which he screams is Hell. Leech and jellyfish-like creatures surround him in the almost cartoonish realm. Eno screams for help among other people's torments before a leech consumes him.

He helped to found the Committees of Civil Society in Syria, drafted the Statement of 1000 and helped to draft the Damascus Declaration. Because of his opposition writings and political actions, he was arrested many times in Syria, banned from working and traveling, kidnapped by the Syrian intelligence forces, and was threatened with being assassinated. He fled Syria in 2008 for exile in Europe where he was elected president of the National Council of Damascus Declaration in exile. Childhood and education Eid was born on September 10, 1950, in the small city of Ariha, Syria, where he spent the first five years of his childhood before moving with his family to Aleppo. He finished his undergraduate studies in Arabic Literature at Aleppo University in 1974. In 1978, he traveled to France to continue his studies, where he received a diploma in Modern Literary Criticism from the Sorbonne (Paris III) on June 29, 1981. In 1983 he obtained a PhD in the same field in the Islamic studies department at the Sorbonne. Work After obtaining his PhD, Eid returned to Syria to teach at Aleppo University, where he taught Modern Literature in the Faculty of Arts and Human Sciences in 1983. He was expelled by the Syrian Intelligence Security Forces Mukhabarat after 2 months for political reasons. He was banned from any professional work for most of his life because of his opposing political opinions. He worked as a full-time researcher in the Palestinian Institute of \\"Ibal 1989–1992\\", where he helped to publish its Journal Kadaya wa Shahadat and published one of his books in the same institute. He taught in the Faculty of Education, Arts and Sciences in Aden University, Yemen, in the academic years 1991–1994. Eid spent most of his time reading and writing books. He has published more than 30 books and written and published many research articles. Eid's main studies were in critiquing novels, so he wrote books about critiquing Arab and Syrian novels. Yet his major work is in sociology, philosophy, and Islamic philosophy. His book The crisis of Enlightenment is considered by many Arabic writers as one of the important books in Arabic enlightenment library. From 1999 to 2010 he worked on critiquing the Islamic mentality and wrote two books under the title The Custodians of the Delusion Temples / Critic of the doctrinal mentality, in which he discussed and critiqued the work of two of the most influential Islamic clerics, Muhammad Sa'id Ramadan al-Buti and Yusuf al-Qaradawi. Political Life Eid has been an opponent of the Syrian government all of his life. He was banned from working, arrested many times, tried by the Military Court for his articles, kidnapped and threatened with assassination because of his opposing positions and writings. His main political activity started in 2000, after the death of Hafez Assad, when he joined with 98 other Syrian intellectuals in issuing a statement called the Statement of 99, calling for democratic reform in Syria. In 2001, he and a number of Syrian writers, thinkers and intellectuals founded the Committees of Civil Society in Syria by issuing the Statement of 1000, which he had drafted, calling for reform and democracy in Syria. It was so named because 1000 Syrian intellectuals signed it. During this period, known as the Damascus Spring, Eid helped to establish many cultural forums around Syria. One of the most recognized was the Jamal al-Atassi Forum in Damascus, where Eid delivered its first lecture, entitled \\"The Culture of Fear\\". This democratic movement was brought to an end by closing all the forums and arresting 12 opponents, who were sentenced to prison for 5–12 years. For four years, Eid wrote from time to time in the An-Nahar newspaper, which became the main publisher of his critical and opposition articles. These articles were published later in his book Questions about the Civil Society. He was brought in front of the Military Court in Aleppo in June 2004 because of them. = Speeches Abroad = In the period between November 15, 2002, and January 15, 2003, Eid was invited by the French Ministry of Higher Education to conduct scientific research at the Sorbonne. This invitation came after huge media attacks against him because of one of his articles in the An-Nahar newspaper of August 23, 2002. A member of the Syrian parliament called for Eid to be prosecuted for treason, claiming that Eid has called for international intervention in Syria similar to the one in Iraq. In 2005, The Goethe Institute was forced to cancel a lecture by Eid on aspects of Germany's Iraq Policy. According to a German diplomat, Eid's presentation made heavy use of veiled language about the Iraqi Ba'ath Party to criticize the Syrian Ba'ath Party. The same year and after the assassination of Rafic Hariri, Eid and other Syrian intellectuals and human rights activists urged withdrawal of the Syrian army from Lebanon = Kidnapping = Eid was kidnapped by the Mukhbarat in the street at midnight on February 8, 2007, because of an article in As-Safir newspaper in which he criticized Hezbollah and its alliance with Syria and Iran. He was freed the next day after they threatened to cut out his tongue if he spoke against Hezbollah again. Later the same year he was banned from traveling to France for medication after being diagnosed with prostate cancer. He was finally allowed to travel after a major two-month support campaign. After his prostate surgery, he insisted on going back to Syria, where he was threatened with assassination by the security forces. The threat said that it would be made to look as if the Salafists had killed him to avenge the assassination of their leader Abul-Kaka, who was mentioned in an article by Neil MacFarquhar in The New York Times, for which Eid had been interviewed. In February 2008, the security forces put his house under siege to arrest him, but he escaped to Lebanon after being hidden for a month in Syria. He spent two months in Beirut, then went with his family into exile in France. He has been living there as a political refugee since then, supported by human rights organizations such as Amnesty International and Revivre. He was elected president of the National Council of Damascus Declaration in Exile in October 2010. He is one of the main figures in the Syrian opposition and plays a major role in the 2011–2012 Syrian uprising. In May 2011, Eid invited Syrian opposition members and figures to the Antalya Conference for Change in Syria, second of its kind since the beginning of the uprising, which he organized together with Ammar al-Qurabi. When Burhan Ghalioun, first chairman of the later Syrian National Council, criticized the Antalya Conference as \\"serving foreign agendas,\\" Eid accused Ghalioun of attempting to appease the regime. On the March 26–27, 2012, he led the initiative of uniting the Syrian opposition groups and figures in Istanbul Conference for the Syrian opposition.

The new aircraft was to be a low wing aircraft so that Yugoslavian pilots could get accustomed to piloting the fighters that the Yugoslav Royal Air Force was using, the Hawker Hurricane, Messerschmitt Bf 109 and the Rogožarski IK-3. The Rogožarski Factory decided to participate in the competition and engaged two well-known aerospace engineers, Miroslav Nenadović and Mitrović Milenko-Spirta, who began working on the design. Building of the prototype started the same year, and it flew for the first time in May 1940. It was handed over to the YRAF for examination, and aircraft functionality.Janić, Čedomir. \\"Rogožarski \\"Brucoš\\"\\" (in (Serbian)). Aeromagazin (-{YU}--Београд: BB Soft). ISSN 1450-6068. Operational history During the testing done in the aircraft repair plant all deficiencies observed were remedied and the plane was able to fly again before October 1940. Simultaneously with the repairs the wings underwent reconstruction so they could enter into reverse - this was the first Yugoslav aircraft with folding wings. Unfortunately, the Commission had already given an unfavorable opinion on the Brucoš. Factory Rogožarski objected to this view, and formed a new commission to re-examine all the additional aircraft that participated in the contest. The second Commission declared the Ikarus Aero 2 aircraft as the best. Desiring, however, to sell his plane, and in cooperation with Royal Yugoslav Navy aviation, the factory re-designed the Rogožarski \\"Brucoš\\" as a floatplane with a 140 kW Walter Six engine and floats from the Canadian Edo Aircraft Corporation. This aircraft was offered to the Navy command as a floatplane for basic training. At the beginning of April, the single Brucoš was in the hangar of the Experiment Aero Group at Zemun airport, only to be flown on 10 April 1941 to the war airfield in Veliki Radinci where the first fighter brigade had been relocated. The Brucoš is believed to have been burnt with other aircraft to keep them from falling into enemy hands.Петровић, Огњан М.

The IRP provides independent scientific assessments and expert advice on a variety of areas, including: • the volume of selected raw material reserves and how efficiently these resources are being used • the lifecycle- long environmental impacts of products and services created and consumed around the globe • options to meet human and economic needs with fewer or cleaner resources. About the report Biofuels emerged as an alternative to fossil fuels as it became apparent that humans were overloading the Earth's atmosphere with carbon dioxide and other gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect. However, as the number of publications devoted to this renewable form of energy mushroomed, policy-makers found it increasingly difficult to identify the pertinent facts on which to make decisions regarding biofuel development and use. This report sought to solve this problem by reviewing the existing literature and considering biofuel production in relation to population growth, future food requirements and climate change. The report concluded that a far more sophisticated approach needs to be taken when developing biofuels as an environmentally friendly energy option.Biofuels: Insights into a Burning Issue, Eric McLamb, Ecology Global Network, November 2009. The report authors found that while burning some biofuels can reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, not all biofuel use leads to cuts in greenhouse gases. The processes of growing and converting the biomass to fuel determined each biofuel's environmental performance. For example, the researchers found that palm oil biodiesel could reduce emissions when compared to fossil fuels by 80 per cent. However, if the plant from which the palm oil was extracted was grown on cropland from cleared tropical forests, greenhouse gas emissions could be as much as 800 per cent higher. And if the land used to grow the palms was cleared from ancient peatlands, the emissions increase over using fossil fuels could rise to 2000 per cent. The report authors found that use of residues and waste was usually more beneficial for the environment than growing crops especially for fuel, as using waste products required no additional land and provided economic benefits.Biofuels Can Be Climate Friends or Climate Enemies, UNEP Reports, Environment News Service, 20 October 2009.

R Youngs published a survey and description of this site.G. R. Youngs, “Three Cilician Castles,” Anatolian Studies, 15, 1965, pp.118-125. In 1987 Robert W.

This castle has two large baileys that are defined by imposing walls, towers, and undercrofts at the northeast and southwest and sheer cliffs elsewhere. In the north or upper bailey is a huge cistern covered by barrel and groined vaults. Edwards discovered that the Byzantines are responsible for the first building period (perhaps with some Arab additions) and that the second building period, which defines most of the complex, is from the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia during the 12th or 13th century. There is no evidence to associate Gökvelioğlu with the castle of Vaner, which appears in the coronation list of Leo I, King of Armenia.Robert W.

Founded in London in 1912, where it was originally titled the Permanent International Eugenics Committee, it was an outgrowth of the first International Eugenics Congress. In 1925, it was retitled. Factionalism within the organization led to its division in 1933, as splinter group the Latin International Federation of Eugenics Organizations was created to give a home to eugenicists who disliked the concepts of negative eugenics, in which unfit groups and individuals are discouraged or prevented from reproducing. As the views of the Nazi party in Germany caused increasing tension within the group and leadership activity declined, it dissolved in the latter half of the 1930s. History In 1912, Leonard Darwin presided over an International Eugenics Congress at the University of London which was sponsored by the Eugenics Education Society (now the Galton Institute) in Britain. Over 800 attendees and an equal number of visitors gathered each day of the Congress to discuss the political, social and cultural context of eugenics and its practical applications. By its end, the Congress had established a Permanent International Eugenics Committee, of which Darwin was named president. In 1921, the Committee arranged for the second meeting of the International Eugenics Congress to take place, at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. Led by Henry Fairfield Osborn, Madison Grant, and Clarence Little, it focused on issues including human heredity, racial differences, regulation of human reproduction, and eugenics. In 1925, the Committee was renamed the International Federation of Eugenic Organizations (IFEO). American eugenicist Charles Davenport was a dominant force in the early history of the body. As its president, in 1929, he wrote a letter to Benito Mussolini, then Prime Minister of Italy, warning him that \\"maximum speed [was] necessary\\" in implementing a eugenics program in Italy, because of the \\"enormous\\" danger of failing to control undesirable reproduction. The IFEO held its 9th Conference in England in 1930. Davenport led the IFEO meeting two years later in New York in 1932 at which Ernst Rüdin was selected as his successor to presidency. In the 1930s, the organization was meeting every two years, with a simultaneous Conference. By 1934, when the group met in Zurich, the original IFEO had representative organizations and individuals from Argentina, Belgium, Cuba, the Dutch East Indies, England, Estonia, France, Italy, Germany, South Africa, Switzerland, and the United States. The IFEO's emphasis on negative eugenics, in which the unfit are eliminated from society through such measures as forced sterilization and laws against reproduction, led to the formation of a splinter group in 1933, when Italian sociologist Corrado Gini established the Latin International Federation of Eugenics Organizations specifically to give a place to organizations fundamentally opposed to the approach. The Latin International Federation of Eugenics Organizations had its first meeting in 1935 and soon represented groups from Argentina, Brazil, Catalonia, France, Mexico, Portugal, Romania, and Switzerland (French and Italian). Focused on encouraging reproduction of the \\"fit\\", the Latin International Federation of Eugenics Organizations was disrupted by the advent of World War II, its second congress cancelled, but Gini continued to promote positive eugenics until his death in 1965. The IFEO began to struggle in the 1930s with the increasingly controversial views on Eugenics in Nazi Germany. Germany had not been permitted to join the IFEO until 1927 due to World War I and subsequent resistance to their membership by the French and Belgian, but the German stance dominated discussion in IFEO meetings in the 1930s. Reporting on the 1934 meeting in Zurich for the journal Eugenics Review, IFEO secretary Mrs. C.B.S. Hodson wrote: > A number of searching questions were exchanged with the different speakers. > The Dutch in particular showed hesitancy in accepting the findings of > transmissibility in regard to certain diseases as an adequate criterion for > sterilization, while those coming from countries such as Switzerland, where > the operation is a practical possibility and increasingly practised, found > less difficulty in accepting the German point of view. In fact, between > those critics who alleged that Germany was going too far and those (notably > the French) who suggested that the categories should include more types, the > protagonists of the new eugenic era in Germany appear to hold a middle > course. Of the 1936 meeting in the Netherlands, where Hodson indicates the views of Germany was a major focus, she wrote: > it emerged that castration of sex offenders is being widely demanded in > Holland, while sterilization is still regarded with distaste and suspicion. > Denmark, originally most cautious to avoid compulsion in sterilization, has > now made this as well as other regulations for the feeble-minded, compulsory > for that category.

Marriage laws are easily promulgated in Scandinavia; in > Germany (supposed land of drastic legislation) advisory marriage bureaux are > paving the way with careful and paternal help towards legislation, which may > be withheld for some time. The 1936 meeting, hosted in Scheveningen, was attended by 50 delegates from 20 countries. At that meeting, the term of the presidency was limited to four years, whereupon Rüdin was made honorary vice president along with Alfred Ploetz, Darwin and Jon Alfred Mjøen, newly elected. Torsten Sjögren was chosen as his successor after five nominees had refused the office. Under Sjögren's presidency, activity in the IFEO lapsed to the point that the British Eugenics Society, instrumental in founding the group, considered withdrawing. According to Stefan Kühl in For the Betterment of the Race (originally Die Internationale der Rassiten 1997), Sjögren was submissive to the Nazi party with their increasingly controversial views on eugenics, which contributed to the disintegration of the organization in the latter half of the 1930s.

The office was established by an act of 21 June 1866 as part of the Bureau of Navigation, Department of the Navy. It was transferred to the Department of Defense on 10 August 1949. The office was abolished on 10 July 1962, replaced by the Naval Oceanographic Office. Objectives Before the hydrographic office was established in 1866, U.S. navigators were almost entirely dependent on British charts. A few private enterprises had prepared and published charts, but had not been able to do so profitably. The Hydrographic Office was established \\"for the improvement of the means for navigating safely the vessels of the Navy and of the mercantile marine, by providing, under the authority of the Secretary of the Navy, accurate and cheap nautical charts, sailing directions, navigators and manuals of instructions for the use of all vessels of the United States, and for the benefit and use of navigators generally\\". History The impetus for establishing the Hydrographical Office came from a petition submitted to Congress in 1863 by the American Shipmasters Association. A Senate committee prepared a report, and a Senate bill was passed on 24 June 1864. The purpose was to empower the Navy Department to give navy and merchant ships the results of surveys and explorations by naval officers in foreign waters. The office was not envisioned as being a rival to the British Admiralty hydrographic office or the French depot of charts, but as an office that could publish charts and directions where there was sufficient information available, priced to cover the cost of paper and printing but not the cost of preparation. In 1873 the office prepared the instruments needed to determine by using the electric telegraph the longitude of West Indian islands and of points on the northern coast of South America where telegraph cables had been laid. A survey of the Gulf of Mexico had found many errors. Some surveying had been carried out in the Pacific Ocean. In July 1875 the Commodore responsible for the office, describing the work that had been accomplished in the previous year, called for a permanent building with proper fireproofing instead of the temporary rented premises, and asked for funding to conduct a proper survey of the Pacific Ocean, for which the charts were in many areas inadequate. That year a great deal had been achieved in charting the Caribbean. By 1880 the office was divided into the Division of Archives, Chart Division, Meteorological Division, Division of Drafting and Engraving and Division of Longitudes. The office had published about 700 charts of foreign coasts. In 1881 the office employed 22 naval officers and 28 civilians. An 1889 report described the function of the office as mainly being reconnaissance of foreign coasts, office duties and publication of compiled maps. The Coast and Geodetic Survey of the Treasury Department was responsible for the systematic hydrographic survey of the coasts of the United States. That year the office employed 39 officers and 40 civilians. The office gave out instruments for meteorological observations to the masters of vessels willing to record and report their findings, requiring only that they take reasonable care of the instruments. In 1894 the hydrographic office paid the sum of $20,000 for patents taken out by a former employee for engraving machines, which would greatly reduce the time and cost of engraving soundings, compasses and border shadings. A number of these machines were in use by 1907. In 1946 the U.S. Navy Hydrographic Office published an ice atlas covering the North American Arctic on a scale of about 1:20,000,000. In 1954 aerial observation of sea ice moved from development into operations, with navy weathermen trained by the Hydrographic Office. Information was transmitted to the Hydrographic office, which prepared forecasts used in planning movement of shipping.

Greville Pooley dispute was the first known prosecution for breach of promise in colonial America and the first in which the defendant was a woman. This case was tried in the chambers of the Virginia Company, and never went to a civil court, for the plaintiff withdrew his complaint. The first successful case was Stretch v. Parker in 1639.  Background  Reverend Greville Pooley proposed marriage to Cecily Jordan, a widow whose husband had died 3 or 4 days previously. He subsequently discovered that his bride-to-be had become engaged to another man. The resulting lawsuit for breach of promise was significant because, until then, such suits had only been filed by women against men.\\" = Historical context = Women - spinster or widow - could own property, and could transfer it in a will. However, they could not patent, purchase or sell land in their own name and own right: for that, a woman needed a male family member. A woman's marriage options, however, were limited to her social class, which produced limited choices if she was “of quality”. There was such a shortage of suitable women for the upper class in colonial Virginia that upper class men would try to bring their unmarried sisters over. The Virginia Company set about procuring wives for the tenants of its plantation by offering to each woman who migrated to Virginia a dowry of clothing, linens, furnishings and a plot of land. The younger women who were chosen were of a lower social order but selected for their good character. About 189 maids and one widow were selected and shipped to Virginia, at a cost of £12, each (about $5,000 in 2018 US dollars), the value of 150 pounds of Virginia tobacco. The prospective husband also had to pay the woman's transportation expense. Involved parties = Greville Pooley = Greville Pooley was an Anglican pastor who arrived in Jamestown, Virginia in August 1622 aboard the James, and took up residence at Fleur Dieu, a plantation belonging to Sir George Yeardley. = Cecily Jordan = Cecily Jordan (known in some accounts as Cecilia, Cecily or Sisselye) was born in 1600 and came to the Jamestown colony as a child aboard the ship Swan in 1610.Dorman, John Frederick, Adventurers of Purse and Person, 4th ed., v1 pp926-929 Living in the household of William Farrar and Cecily Jordan at the time of Jamestown Muster was a female age 7, name of Temperance Baley. Her second marriage was to Samuel Jordan and she had two daughters with him, Margaret and Mary. Jordan died about April 1623, leaving Cecily a widow with three children.Nugent, Cavaliers and Pioneers, 226 = William Farrar = William Farrar arrived in Jamestown aboard the Neptune in August 1618. He had a 100-acre patent upon the Appomattox River. He survived the Indian massacre of 1622, and is noted in the Jamestown muster as head of house in the fort of Samuel Jordan, a relatively safe fortified rallying place for the massacre survivors. quoted as follows: After surviving the Indian massacre of 1622, he is found living with Mrs Jordan in 1624 at Jordans Journey.  Controversy  Within a span of four months after Greville Pooley's arrival, his neighbor Samuel Jordan died, leaving Ciceley a widow with two daughters. According to one account, three or four days after the funeral, Pooley took hold of the hand of Mrs Jordan and pledged himself to her in marriage. She protested that it would not look right because it was too soon after the funeral. Pooley’s version of the affair was that he approached Captain Isaac Madison to act as an intermediary for his marriage proposal. Madison asserted that, while she would \\"as soon marry Mr Pooley as marry anyone else\\", she would not marry any man until she was delivered of her child. Pooley, encouraged by this and fearful that some other man would beat him to the \\"trough\\", rushed to visit her. During the visit he asked for a drink. She sent a servant to get it; Pooley asked that she get it herself, and afterwards, they drank a toast. He claimed that he then grabbed Mrs Jordan's hand and said: \\"I Grivell Pooley, take thee Sysley, to my wedded wife, to have, and to hold, till death us depart, and thereto I plight thee my troth.\\" Then (holding her by the hand) she replied \\"I Sysley, take thee Grivell, to my wedded husband, to have, and to hold, till death us depart\\". Captain Madison stated that he did not hear Mrs Jordan say any of those words, nor did he remember Pooley asking her if she consented to those words. Mrs. Jordan, fearful of gossip, asked Pooley to keep the affair a secret, but Pooley began to brag of the proposal and upcoming marriage. This angered Mrs Jordan, and she said, as sworn to by Mrs Mary Madison, “that if he had not revealed it, he might have fared better\\". Captain Isaac Madison, as recorded in C. O. 1, Vol. II, No. 30 Document in Public Record Office, London List of Records No. 521, testified that he had not heard the words of a proposal, nor acceptance by Mrs. Jordan. Instead, Mrs Jordan accepted the proposal of William Farrar. Rev Pooley, upon learning that Mrs Jordan had contracted herself to Farrar, filed suit with the Virginia Company. The company could not decide if Rev Pooley's relationship to Mrs Jordan was a formal or legal contract, and deferred it to civil lawyers. Before the matter could be taken further, Rev Pooley met another widow and dropped the suit. Subsequently, Pooley was the defendant in another suit, brought by a Mr Pawlett, who accused Pooley of insulting him. He was summoned to court in March 1629 because of a dispute with Edward Auborne. Subsequently, Pooley and his family were all killed in 1629 in an Indian massacre. Aftermath of the controversy The governor and council perceived the Jordan-Pooley-Farrar affair to be a dangerous precedent and issued a proclamation against a recurrence. But that didn’t dissuade others: within a year, Eleanor Spragg had to stand before her congregation and confess to contracting to two men at the same time. The court, in an attempt to halt the spread of the practice decreed that each minister give warning in his church that offenders, male or female, will be whipped or fined according to their social status Like all prohibitions, this too was ineffective,. It was not until Stretch v. Parker in 1639 that a breach of promise suit in which the woman was the defendant was successfully pursued.

It transfers the control of police forces from police authorities to elected Police and Crime Commissioners. The first police commissioner elections were held in November 2012. The next elections took place in May 2016 and will subsequently take place every four years. The Act repeals the provisions in the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 which prohibit protests near Parliament Square, and instead restricts certain \\"prohibited activities\\" in Parliament Square garden and the adjoining footways. The police have used these powers to confiscate pizza boxes, tarpaulin and umbrellas from protesters in Parliament Square. The Act removed the statutory requirement for the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs to include scientists. The move follows the sacking of David Nutt from the council in 2009. Section 153 of the Act amends section 1 of Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 so that an arrest warrant for an offence of universal jurisdiction cannot be issued without the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions, unless applied for by a Crown Prosecutor.

Among the suggestions for the site prior to the completion of the 1984 redevelopment was the construction of a Grenfell Street underpass, although these plans never eventuated. Another, smaller, redevelopment occurred in 1996 when the centre was under the management of Hawaiian Investments. In April, 2003 a $100m redevelopment of the site was announced, to be completed in three stages. The first stage of the redevelopment, completed at a cost of $25m, was opened by Premier Mike Rann on 22 November 2005, and effectively doubled the retail area of the centre. Shortly before the completion of the first stage, Amart All Sports announced that they would be moving into the new premises, joining Harvey Norman who had previously announced their tenancy in the expanded site.

Josep Pascó i Mensa () (1855–1910), was a painter, illustrator and designer from Catalonia, an autonomous community of Spain, mostly noted for book illustrations and theater set design. He was born in Sant Feliu de Llobregat in 1855 and died in Barcelona in 1910. He trained as a painter at the Escola de la Llotja with Simó Gómez and at the workshop of designer Josep Planella. He began his career as a mural painter but then switched to canvas, mostly landscapes. One of his most original paintings is that of the flag of the Cau Ferrat in Sitges. His most distinguished work is in the illustration of books and the design of decorative objects, as well as the design of theater sets, starting early with those for small amateur theater companies. In 1887, he went to Madrid, where he worked at the Royal Theater and was then commissioned to decorate the Principe Alfonso Theater stage. In 1896 he went to Mexico to paint the scenery of the National Theater (since replaced by the Palacio de Bellas Artes). When he returned to Spain, he decided to focus on theater lighting. He also worked on the decoration of the home of Ramon Casas i Carbó in Barcelona. Pascó's illustration work was mostly devoted to magazines such as Arte y Letras (Arts and Letters) and La Ilustració catalana (Catalan Illustration), done under the pseudonym of Brisa. He also produced a number of very notable illustration for scrolls. Pascó later became a professor at the College of Arts and Industries in Barcelona, and the artistic director of the journal Hispania.

The text, written on vellum, is a version of the Latin Vulgate Bible, which contains the entire Bible,Bruce M. Metzger, The Early Versions of the New Testament, Oxford University Press, 1977, p. 339. including the trinity reference Comma Johanneum.  Description  The text is written in three columns, 63-65 lines in a single column, in Visigothic characters, on 375 parchment leaves (43,8 by 33 cm). The Latin text of the four Gospels is a representative of the Spanish type of the Vulgate. It is the second important manuscript of the Spanish type (after Codex Cavensis). It contains the controverted text of the Comma Johanneum (1 John 5:7) in the same location as the Codex Cavensis (after v. 8). And it also contains the Prologue to the Canonical Epistles affirming the verse.  History  According to the note, Servandus of Seville gave the manuscript to his friend John, Bishop of Cordova, who in turn offered it in 988 CE to the see of Servandus. The note was examined by A. Lowe, L. F. Smith, and A. C. Millares. The year 988 is usually regarded by scholars as a date of the completion of the codex. The manuscript was collated by Chr. Palomares for the Sixtine Vulgate, whose work written in 1569 is now presented in the Vatican Library (Lat. 9508). It was not used in the Vulgata Clementina, as the manuscript was reached by Cardinal Carafa too late. The text was published by Giuseppe Bianchini in 1740. It was collated by John Wordsworth for his edition of the New Testament of Vulgate. Wordsworth designated the manuscript by siglum T.

Early life  Yager was born and raised in Page County, Virginia, a son of Nicholas Wesley Yager and Christina Williams Overall Yager. In 1848, he matriculated at the Virginia Military Institute, graduating four years later, fifth in his class, with fellow Page countians Simeon Beauford Gibbons and Hiram Jackson Strickler, as well as later Confederate notables, Thomas T.

Kansas, Texas, and marriage  Following graduation, Yager worked briefly as a banker in Virginia, and soon after traveled to Kansas with fellow Page countian and VMI classmate Hiram Jackson Strickler, taking with him several slaves, including a valet. While in Kansas, Strickler and Strickler had real estate transactions together, most apparently being in Shawnee County. As part of the many transactions, Yager conveyed one- half interest in Lucknow to Strickler, and Strickler conveyed one-half interest in Bellmont to Yager. Relocating to Texas, Yager settled in Seguin, Guadalupe County, where he met Mary Elizabeth Rhodes, whom he married in 1863.

The Civil War years  Yager joined the Confederate service as a 1st lieutenant, in April, 1861, and served initially as adjutant for the First Regiment, Texas Mounted Rifles, also known as McCulloch's Regiment. He spent the autumn and winter of 1861 with this unit in Central Texas and engaged in sporadic negotiations and skirmishes with local Indian groups.

Augustus Carl Buchel as commanding officer. Following Buchel's mortal in action at the Battle of Pleasant Hill, Louisiana, on April 9, 1864, Yager was elevated to colonel and command of the regiment. Yager held this post until the end of the war.  Postwar  Following the Civil War, Yager remained in Texas, into the 1870s, before returning with his family to his native Page County. In subsequent years, he served as representative for the county in the Virginia House of Delegates (1874–1875) and the Virginia Senate (1879–80). At the end of his term in the senate, Yager became active in county affairs, first serving as Superintendent of Schools (1880), and later as Treasurer of Page Co. (1884–1896).

Biography =Studies= He studied at Delaware College until 1851, when he entered the chemical laboratory of Frederick A. Genth, and there made analyses of minerals, the results of which were published in the American Journal of Science, and were afterward incorporated in Dana's Mineralogy. In 1856 he went to Germany and pursued professional studies for two years. =Civil War service= Soon after the beginning of the Civil War he became captain in the 91st Pennsylvania Regiment, and served with the Army of the Potomac until after the Battle of Fair Oaks. Failing health then led to his resignation. He returned to Germany, where he studied at the University of Munich, and then at that of Jena, receiving there the degree of M.D. in 1864. On his return to the United States, he was appointed acting assistant surgeon in the U.S. Army, and was detailed to Cuyler Hospital in Germantown, Pennsylvania. In 1865 he resigned from the service to enter on his private practice. On April 15, 1865, Keyser was one of three co-Founders of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States, or MOLLUS. It was the first post-Civil War veterans' organization, and was open to men who had served in the suppression of the Rebellion and who had held a commission in the armed forces of the United States. He was assigned MOLLUS insignia number 00003. The organization exists today, composed largely of the descendants of those officers. =Medical practice= He became director of the Philadelphia Eye and Ear Infirmary. In 1868 he delivered a course of lectures to physicians upon the accommodation and refraction of the eye, and in 1870 he delivered the first regular course of clinical lectures on ophthalmology that ever was given in Philadelphia, repeating the course in 1871-72.

The massive altar is precisely rectangular and stood in front of the temple. The temple was to the west (right) of the altar. The altar was 2.7 m. wide and 25 m. long. Only 8 m. of its northern section survive. The rest of the altar was built over, to create the foundations of the Saint Theodore monastery. The Temple of Artemis is an Archaic Greek temple in Corfu, Greece, built in around 580 BC in the ancient city of Korkyra (or Corcyra). It is found on the property of the Saint Theodore monastery, which is located in the suburb of Garitsa. The temple was dedicated to Artemis. It is known as the first Doric temple exclusively built with stone. It is also considered the first building to have incorporated all of the elements of the Doric architectural style. Very few Greek temple reliefs from the Archaic period have survived, and the large fragments of the group from the pediment are the earliest significant survivals. The temple was a peripteral–styled building with a pseudodipteral configuration. Its perimeter was rectangular, with width of and length with an eastward orientation so that light could enter the interior of the temple at sunrise. It was one of the largest temples of its time. The metope of the temple was probably decorated, since remnants of reliefs featuring Achilles and Memnon were found in the ancient ruins. The temple has been described as a milestone of Ancient Greek architecture and one of 150 masterpieces of Western architecture. The architecture of the Corfu temple may have influenced the design of an archaic sanctuary found at Sant'Omobono in Rome which dates to the archaic period and incorporates similar design elements. Kaiser Wilhelm II, while vacationing at his summer palace of Achilleion in Corfu and while Europe was preparing for war, was involved in excavations at the site of the ancient temple. The Temple of Artemis is approximately 700 m. to the northwest of the Temple of Hera in the Palaiopolis of Corfu. The massive altar of the sanctuary is precisely rectangular and stood in front of the temple. It was 2.7 m. wide and 25 m. long. Only 8 m. of its northern section survive. The rest of the altar was built over, under the foundations of the Saint Theodore monastery. Excavations The Gorgon as depicted on the western pediment from the Artemis Temple of Corfu, on display at the Archaeological Museum of Corfu. The ruins were found during the Napoleonic Wars by soldiers of the French general François-Xavier Donzelot as they were digging, preparing for trench warfare. Kaiser Wilhelm II had a \\"lifelong obsession\\" with the Gorgon sculpture, which is attributed to his attendance at seminars on Greek Archaeology while at the University of Bonn. The seminars were given by archaeologist Reinhard Kekulé von Stradonitz, who later became the Kaiser's advisor. Kaiser himself, while residing at his summer palace of Achilleion in Corfu and while Europe was preparing for war, was involved in excavations at the site of the ancient temple. In 1911 the Kaiser, along with Greek archaeologist Federiko Versakis on behalf of the Greek Archaeological Society and the famous German archaeologist Wilhelm Dörpfeld on behalf of the German Archaeological Institute, started excavations at the Artemis Temple of Corfu. The Kaiser's activities in Corfu at the time involved both political and archaeological matters. The excavations involved political manoeuvering due to the antagonism that had developed between the two principal archaeologists at the Corfu Temple site.. Little remains today on the site, with only the foundation of the temple and other fragments still existing there. However, the existing ruins have provided sufficient information for a complete reconstruction of the architectural details of the temple. Temple architecture Remains of the altar. Only 8 m. of its northern section survive. The rest of the 25 m-long altar was built over, to create the foundations of the Saint Theodore monastery which was built on the site of the temple. The wall of the monastery can be seen on the right of the picture, south of the altar remnant. The temple was located to the west (right) of the altar. The temple had a massive altar which was built precisely rectangular and stood in front of the temple. It was 2.7 m. wide and 25 m. long. Only 8 m. of its northern section survive. The rest of the altar disappeared under the foundations of the Saint Theodore monastery which was built on the site of the temple. The temple was located to the west (right) of the altar. The building was supported around its perimeter by colonnades consisting of two rows of eight columns each for the front and back of the building, while the sides were supported by two rows of seventeen columns each. Remnants of the Artemis Sanctuary in Corfu At the centre of the temple, there was a rectangular inner chamber or cella wide and long, which was subdivided in three spaces by two colonnades consisting of ten columns each. The temple of Artemis in Corfu and the Parthenon are the only Greek temples with eight columns between antae. The outer colonnade of eight by seventeen columns, also called the peristyle, had enough separation from the inner chamber that a second colonnade could be added in the interior. The Corfu Temple, however, does not have this inner colonnade, for economy reasons. This configuration of a single colonnade, in a space allowing for a second, is called pseudodipteral. The Artemis Temple in Corfu is the earliest known example of this architectural style. The front and back of the temple featured two pediments, of which only the western one survives in good condition, while the eastern pediment lies in fragments. The pediments were decorated with mythical figures, sculpted in high relief. This is the first known example of a decorated pediment in Greece. Both pediments appear to be decorated in an identical manner and they feature a large relief of the Gorgon Medusa, more than 9 ft. high. The pediment measures 9 ft. 4 inches high at the centre. The sculptures incorporated in these pediments are considered the first substantial specimens of Greek sculpture from a Doric building. The western pediment along with other architectural fragments are exhibited at the Archaeological Museum of Corfu. The pediment has been described by The New York Times as the \\"finest example of Archaic temple sculpture extant\\". Pediment details The Gorgon wearing the belt of intertwined snakes, a fertility symbol. To the right of the picture is the small relief of her son Khrysaor The pediment depicts Medusa in a formulaic, stylised fashion; her feet are arranged in a configuration suggesting rotation, which in turn indicates motion or flight when applied to the attributes of Medusa, especially Medusa's wings. The Medusa is wearing a short skirt which allows her legs freedom of movement while she is fleeing from Perseus. Her motion is further indicated by the formulaic positioning of her legs in the so–called Knielauf position which stylistically resembles a swastika. The Gorgon is shown with a girdle of intertwined serpents; the girdle is a fertility symbol traditionally associated with female reproduction and sexuality. The presence of the snakes, however, adds a demonic quality as well as an element of danger. Two more snakes radiate outward from her neck. The Medusa figure closely resembles \\"Mistress of Animals\\" deities found in the Near East and also resembles Mesopotamian demoness Lamashtu who was the equivalent of the Greek deity Lamia. The left panther. Her children, Pegasus and Khrysaor, are at each side of her, despite the fact that they were born after her death. The face of Medusa is repulsive and shows an evil \\"archaic smile\\". The panthers, flanking Medusa on each side, serve as temple guardians and they gaze outward as if to visually inspect their domain. The smaller size of the guardian leopards relative to the pediment enclosure and their high relief indicates that the archaic sculptor desired to disengage the animals from their environment. The head of the Medusa figure clashes with the pediment outline and evokes a frightening effect. It has also been suggested that since it is unusual for Artemis not to be depicted on the pediment of her own Temple, Medusa may represent the chthonic or demonic side of Artemis, since both entities were patrons of animals. The function of the Medusa and panther figures is believed to be apotropaic, that is, their function was to ward-off evil and prevent it from entering the temple. A dead warrior and seated figure on the left side of the pediment. Behind the leopard on the left lies a seated figure. The figure was shown to be attacked by a spear-wielding figure, which has disappeared from the pediment. Behind the seated figure, on its left, lies a bearded figure of a dead warrior, facing outward from the pediment. Behind the leopard to the right, two figures are shown. The standing figure closest to the leopard is believed to be Zeus who is depicted in partial profile wielding a thunderbolt against another figure, which faces outward from the pediment. The figure is presented with a beard and is kneeling. To the right of these figures, another relief of a dead warrior is believed to have existed. A beardless Zeus is depicted launching a thunderbolt against a kneeling figure. There are reasons to suppose that the seated figure is Rhea, or Cronus, in which case the scenes depicted to the right and left of the leopards might depict a single subject, the Titanomachy, the battle between the gods and the Titans, which would better fit with a beardless (i.e. younger) Zeus, who is rarely depicted without a beard. There are also arguments that the seated figure illustrates King Priam of Troy being slain by the Greek hero Neoptolemos and that the scene on the left is inspired from the Trojan War. If this is the case, then there are two themes present in the pediment: the Sack of Troy and the Gigantomachy, the battle between the gods and Giants. Since these figures are not connected to the legend of Medusa, it is thought that the apotropaic function of temple symbols such as the Medusa and the panthers, as guardian symbols of the Temple, is starting to be replaced by the idea of using figures and themes from mythical stories as temple decoration. The decorative function, in time, prevailed over the apotropaic one. Film The Gaze of the Gorgon is a film-poem created by Tony Harrison, which examines the politics of conflict in the 20th century using the Gorgon as a metaphor. The narration of the film is done through the mouth of a statue of the Jewish poet Heinrich Heine, which Kaiser Wilhelm II had removed from the Achilleion after he took over ownership of the palace from Empress Elizabeth of Austria. The film describes the connection between Heine, the Corfu Gorgon, and the Kaiser, who had an obsession with the Gorgon.

The text, written on vellum, is a version of the Latin Vulgate Bible. It contains the whole Bible,Bruce M. Metzger, The Early Versions of the New Testament, Oxford University Press, 1977, p. 344-345. with some parts written on purple vellum.  Description  The Book of Psalms and the four Gospels are written on purple parchment in letters of silver (initial letters are in gold). The text is written in a minute minuscule hand. The Latin text of the Gospel is a representative of the Theodulphianus recension of the Vulgate, and is considered the most important witness of this recension (other manuscripts are Codex Annicensis and Codex Hubertatus). It bears a strong textual resemblance to the Codex Hubertanus, although it is written in a smaller hand. The text of the Gospel of Matthew is very close to the Codex Cavensis. The Books of Kings, Book of Chronicles, Book of Ezra, and Pauline epistles (partially) are close textually to the Spanish type of the Vulgate. In Book of Genesis, Book of Joshua, and Book of Judges, the text is close to the Codex Amiatinus. The Codex contains the Comma Johanneum (1 John 5:7), a spurious text referring to the trinity, in its usual location (unlike the Codex Cavensis and Codex Toletanus).  History  E. A. Lowe dated the manuscript to the eight or ninth century. Formerly it belonged to the Cathedral of Orleans, the family of the Mesmes, then to the National Library of France. The manuscript was examined and described by Samuel Berger. It was collated by John Wordsworth and H. J. White for their edition of the text of the Vulgate.

Cyber Promotions, Inc. was a ruling by the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio in 1997 that set an early precedent for granting online service providers the right to prevent commercial enterprises from sending unsolicited email advertising - also known as spam - to its subscribers. It was one of the first cases to apply United States tort law (Restatement (Second) of Torts §217 and §218) to restrict spamming on computer networks. The court held that Cyber Promotions' intentional use of CompuServe's proprietary servers to send unsolicited email was an actionable trespass to chattels and granted a preliminary injunction preventing the spammer from sending unsolicited advertisements to any email address maintained by CompuServe. Background In 1997 the Plaintiff, CompuServe Inc., was one of the largest commercial online service providers in the United States. Similar to America Online, CompuServe provided its subscribers with access to content both within its own proprietary network as well providing a gateway, like a simple ISP, to the Internet at large. One of the primary roles taken on by CompuServe was that of an email service provider. The Defendant, Cyber Promotions, Inc., was an online direct email marketing company, headed by founder and CEO Sanford Wallace. Cyber Promotions was \\"in the business of sending unsolicited e-mail advertisements [spam] on behalf of themselves and their clients to hundreds of thousands of Internet users, many of whom [were] CompuServe subscribers\\". As a result of these efforts (as well as others), Sanford Wallace came to be known as \\"Spamford\\" Wallace. In the months leading up to the case, CompuServe subscribers complained to the company about the large amount of spam they were receiving (from Cyber Promotions and other mass emailers). Many threatened to discontinue their subscriptions unless CompuServe took preventative measures to block the spam. As a result, CompuServe introduced a set of email filters on its servers to block incoming spam and prevent the spam's delivery to subscribers. In response, Cyber Promotions took measures to circumvent CompuServe's filters, such as disguising the origin of their messages, allowing its unsolicited email messages to reach their destination. On October 24, 1996, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio issued a temporary restraining order against Cyber Promotions, preventing them from: > # Using CompuServe accounts or CompuServe's equipment or support services to > send or receive electronic mail or messages or in connection with the > sending or receiving of electronic mail or messages. # Inserting any false > reference to a CompuServe account or CompuServe equipment in any electronic > message sent by Cyber Promotions. # Falsely representing or causing their > electronic mail or messages to bear the representation that any electronic > mail or message sent by Cyber Promotions was sent by or originated from > CompuServe or a CompuServe account. Following the issuance of this restraining order, CompuServe filed an application for a preliminary injunction to both extend the duration of this temporary restraining and prevent Cyber Promotions from sending unsolicited advertisements to CompuServe subscribers. This case arises from that application. Case CompuServe's primary argument was that Cyber Promotions was \\"trespassing\\" on CompuServe's personal property whenever it sent spam that passed through CompuServe's email servers on its way to CompuServe subscribers. To prove its case, CompuServe had to show that the act of sending spam through its email servers constituted a trespass on personal property and that they had sustained monetary damages as a result of this trespass. In its defense, Cyber Promotions argued that CompuServe's email service was a \\"public utility\\" that implicitly granted Cyber Promotions permission to send email through its servers. Cyber Promotions also claimed that the free speech clause of the First Amendment gave it the right to send spam to whomever it pleased. Traditionally, one who commits a trespass to a chattel is subject to liability to the possessor of the chattel if, but only if, # he dispossesses the other of the chattel, or # the chattel is impaired as to its condition, quality, or value, or # the possessor is deprived of the use of the chattel for a substantial time, or # bodily harm is caused to the possessor, or harm is caused to some person or thing in which the possessor has a legally protected interest. Relying on the Restatement of Torts, Judge Graham found that Cyber Promotions did indeed trespass on Compuserve's personal property by sending email through its servers. While Cyber Promotions did not actually take possession of CompuServe's computers, the unsolicited emails they sent \\"intentionally intermeddled\\" with CompuServe's computer systems. Because this intermeddling caused CompuServe's computing resources to slow down, the value of those resources available to CompuServe's paying subscribers was reduced, and monetary damages were incurred. Additionally, the complaints filed by CompuServe subscribers and the fact that some of these complaints resulted in canceled subscriptions, suggested that CompuServe's reputation as a business was also jeopardized. Further, the court opinion stated that \\"if defendants were to prevail on their First Amendment arguments, the viability of electronic mail as an effective means of communication for the rest of society would be put at risk\\", as consumers would have to wade through so much junk mail that email would no longer be efficient. In response to Cyber Promotions' first argument, Judge Graham conceded that there was, in fact, an \\"implied privilege\\" to utilize CompuServe's system to send email messages from the Internet. However, that privilege was not relevant because CompuServe's policy statement explicitly prohibited spamming. Additionally, Graham asserted that CompuServe made it clear that it did not wish to receive spam from Cyber Promotions and was installing software to filter it out. The fact that Cyber Promotions actively tried to circumvent these filters only exacerbated the issue. In response to Cyber Promotions' second argument, Judge Graham noted that \\"allowing the First Amendment to trump private property rights is unwarranted where there are adequate alternative avenues of communication\\". Given that Cyber Promotions could have easily sent its advertisements to CompuServe's subscribers through a number of different mediums, and that CompuServe's customers had other available means of accessing Cyber Promotion's messages if they were unhappy with the injunction, Judge Graham concluded that a First Amendment argument held no merit. Decision The court ruled that CompuServe had a viable claim for trespass to chattels and was entitled to injunctive relief to protect its personal property. The temporary restraining order filed on October 24, 1996, was extended until final judgment was entered in the case. Additionally, Cyber Promotions and Sanford Wallace were enjoined from sending unsolicited advertisements to email addresses controlled by CompuServe while the action was still pending. The final consent order was served by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on May 9, 1997, permanently enjoining Cyber Promotions from \\"causing, authorizing, participating in, or assisting others\\" to send unsolicited email to CompuServe e-mail addresses, or to employ any \\"false or misleading reference\\" to CompuServe \\"in the header of or in connection with any electronic message\\". Cyber Promotions was also required to pay approximately $65,000 in CompuServe legal fees. In exchange, CompuServe agreed that Cyber Promotions be allowed put up ads within the CompuServe internal network as well as send emails to subscribers who have explicitly requested Cyber Promotions' emails. Implications CompuServe Inc. v. Cyber Promotions, Inc. is the first of a series of cases where the trespass to chattels doctrine was reconfigured and applied to the internet. It set the basis for the prosecution of spam for trespass. Although some believe that applying an old common law of torts to the Internet is a step in the wrong direction, other scholars believe that at the least, it can guide consideration of prospective laws.

Written for Philip Gardiner's The Stone - No Soul Unturned movie and Paranormal Haunting - The Curse Of The Blue Moon Inn, both of these songs featured in his debut album Reason To Exist, which reached number 3 in the Amazon blues download charts. Dolan also appeared as a guest musician on Mindscape a Sky TV series for two seasons, Performing live with artists such as No Redemption, Arthur Brown, China Soul and Steve Hackett. His lyrics are themed on political, social and philosophical issues. Inspired by artists such as Bob Dylan, Woody Guthrie, Shane MacGowan, Bob Marley as well as his father, Liam, and uncle Joe Dolan. His music spans a variety of genres, including blues, folk, rock and Irish folk music. Dolan performs vocals with guitar and harmonica. Backed by a variety of musicians, he has performed for TV and films since April 2010, and at festivals and concerts since 2006. The Stone - No Soul Unturned, which Dolan also starred in, won an award for 'Best Foreign Film' at the Mountain Film Festival in 2011. His debut album was released by Reality Entertainment. Life and career Dolan was born at King's Mill Hospital in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, England, and was raised in this area. His father and uncle emigrated from Ireland when they were two years old and both became singer-songwriters. Dolan began writing, singing songs and playing guitar in the late 1990s. He was a busker as well as a performer at various festivals and pubs learning his trade with his father, Liam and (late) uncle Joe Dolan. At this time, Dolan was also studying at the University of Derby, where he gained a degree majoring in Creative Writing and minoring in Theatre, Film and Television Studies. Dolan was known by most locals as a busker on the streets of Mansfield. This was where he got his first chance to become involved in acting, as well as writing and performing music for film and television, when he was invited to work on The Plague, a futuristic British horror film, created and produced by Nik Spencer. Spencer spotted Dolan busking and also asked him to write a number of songs for the soundtrack of the film. Whilst working on The Plague, Dolan met Phil Gardiner who was impressed with his work and asked him to play a leading role in the award- winning film, The Stone - No Soul Unturned. Dolan also wrote and produced a song called 'Land of Fear', which featured in the film. In 2011, Dolan also performed on several occasions as a resident musician on Mindscape for Sky TV. He wrote and recorded \\"Blue Moon Inn\\", for Paranormal Haunting - The Curse Of The Blue Moon Inn and signed a deal with Reality Entertainment, an independent record label who released his debut album on 8 September 2011. \\"Reason To Exist\\" reached number 3 in the Amazon blues chart. Dolan has stated that the closing of coal mines in Nottinghamshire was a significant influence on the album. Dolan has also released music videos for his songs \\"Blue Moon Inn\\" and \\"Land Of Fear\\". \\"Blue Moon Inn\\" also featured his ex-partner, Laura Wilcockson playing violin. In January 2019, Dolan was invited to play music on Mansfield 103.2 FM in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of The Beatles' rooftop concert.

He was the son of the English painter Charles Coleman and brother of the less well-known Italian painter Francesco Coleman. He painted, in oils and in watercolours, the landscapes of the Campagna Romana and the Agro Pontino; he was a collector, grower and painter of orchids. Because of his supposedly Oriental air, he was known to his friends as \\"Il Birmano\\", the Burmese.  Life  Enrico Coleman was born in Rome on 21 June 1846. He was the fourth child of the English painter Charles Coleman, who had come to Rome in 1831 and settled there permanently in 1835, and of a famous artist's model from Subiaco, Fortunata Segadori (or Segatori), whom he had married in 1836. Coleman was initially taught by his father, and either did or did not study at the Accademia di San Luca in Rome. Following the mocking reception of Una mandria di bufali nelle paludi pontine, a naturalistic painting of a herd of buffaloes in the Pontine marshes, at the International Artist's Club in 1872, he reportedly began to paint genre subjects in the manner of the thenfashionable Mariano Fortuny, although no works showing the influence of the Spanish painter are known. At the instigation of Nino Costa, he soon returned to the depiction of the people, animals and landscapes of the Campagna Romana and the Agro Pontino. An album of watercolours from this youthful period (1871–1875) was recently rediscovered and was shown in Rome in 2004. Coleman was lover of orchids, which he painted, collected and cultivated. A famous album of 88 orchid paintings, either in watercolour or in gouache, painted in the 1890s and entitled Orchidea Birmana was sold to an Englishman; it was \\"rediscovered\\" in the 1980s and published in facsimile. An 1894 watercolour of orchids is in the Galleria Comunale d'Arte Moderna e Contemporanea in Rome. Coleman had a remarkable collection of indigenous orchids, which he cultivated himself in special boxes at his house at 6 via Valenziana. He successfully hybridised Orchis provincialis var. pauciflora and Orchis mascula var. rosea; the botanist Fabrizio Cortesi named the hybrid Orchis x colemanii Cortesi in his honour. In 1875, Coleman was among the founding members of the Società degli Acquarellisti, the Roman society of watercolourists; he participated in the society's first exhibition in 1876, and continued to exhibit with them until 1907. In 1878 he was elected an honorary member of the Société Royale Belge des Aquarellistes, the Belgian royal society of watercolourists, with which he participated in the Salon de Paris in 1879. From then on he began to exhibit regularly. He sent paintings to the 4th Esposizione Nazionale di Belle Arti, or national fine art show, of Turin in 1880, and to that of Milan in the following year; he showed works in London in 1882 and in Rome in 1883. In 1885, Coleman was among the founding members of the group In Arte Libertas, of which Nino Costa was the leading force and the other founding members were Vincenzo Cabianca, Onorato Carlandi, , , , Giuseppe Raggio, Alfredo Ricci, Mario de Maria and . Coleman had six paintings in the first exhibition of the group, which took place from 10–28 February 1886, in the studio of an amateur painter named Giorgi, at 72 via S. Nicola da Tolentino. He participated in some measure in all of the subsequent annual exhibitions. From 1895 to 1899 the group exhibited collectively at the Esposizione Internazionale d'Arte della Città di Venezia, which would later become the Biennale di Venezia; Coleman continued to exhibit in every edition until the ninth in 1910. Shortly after the death of Costa in 1903, In Arte Libertas was transformed into a new society, the \\"XXV della Campagna Romana\\". The XXV was born in the trattoria \\"Il Pozzo di San Patrizio\\" on the via Nomentana, on the evening of 24 May 1904. Coleman was elected \\"capocetta\\", \\"little head\\" or president, for life. The other members included Giuseppe and Ettore Ferrari, Onorato Carlandi, Giulio Aristide Sartorio, members of the earlier group, who were joined by Cesare Pascarella, Arturo Noci, Lorenzo Cecconi, , , Amedeo and , and others. Enrico Coleman never married. Although he kept his British nationality throughout his life, he never visited Britain. The only large city he ever saw was Turin. According to Diego Angeli, apart from that one journey, he never went further north than Monte Soratte, nor further south than Terracina. As well as painting and orchids, he loved shooting and mountain-climbing. He was among the early members of the Club Alpino Italiano, which he joined in 1881, and of which he was made an honorary member for life in 1906. The club published his panorama of the Gran Sasso d'Italia in 1884, and awarded him a gold medal at the Esposizione Alpina, or mountaineering exhibition, in Bologna in 1888. He died in Rome of pleurisy in the night of either 14 February 1911 or 4 February 1911, and is buried in the non-Catholic cemetery of Testaccio; the date on his gravestone is calculated from the foundation of Rome. Later the same year, he was the only artist to have a whole room dedicated to him at the Esposizione internazionale d'arte in Rome, in which forty-nine of his works, both oils and watercolours, were hung by a group of his friends. In the exhibitions of Castel Sant'Angelo for the 50th anniversary of the unification of Italy, his watercolours of mountain landscapes formed part of the exhibit of the Club Alpino Italiano. On the anniversary of Coleman's death, thirty of his works from the collection of his sister Giorgina were shown at the Studio Jandolo at 52a, via Margutta, on the initiative of Onorato Carlandi, Diego Angeli, Arturo Lancellotti and Jandolo himself.

The College originated from the collapse of Charles, Prince of Wales' controversial Foundation for Integrated Health, which closed after allegations of money-laundering and fraud. Officers and directors Its officers and associates include current and former senior NHS staff. Its current Vice Presidents are Sir Muir Gray, currently Chief Knowledge Officer of the NHS, Duncan Selbie, who is also Chief Executive of Public Health England and Harry Brünjes, founder of the Premier Medical Group. Its first President was Graeme Catto, former President of the General Medical Council. Its current Chairman is Michael Dixon. History One director of the College, Michael Dixon, is a former director of the Foundation for Integrated Health. A former director of the College, George Lewith, was a council member of the foundation and his research unit at the University of Southampton played an important role in the development of the foundation. The Foundation for Integrated Health promoted alternative medicine (using the term \\"integrative medicine\\") and closed down in 2010 after an accounting fraud. When the College of Medicine was launched, several commentators writing in the Guardian and the BMJ, expressed the opinion that the new organisation was simply a re-branding of the Prince's Foundation, some describing it as \\"Hamlet without the Prince\\". Alternative medicine critic and pharmacologist David Colquhoun has argued that the College is extremely well- funded and seemed from the beginning to be very confident of the Prince's support, explicitly describing its mission as \\"to take forward the vision of HRH the Prince of Wales\\" in an early presentation. The College responded to this initial criticism by stating that it aims were to \\"promote a more politically and professionally transparent, patient centred, and sustainable approach to healthcare, using whatever social or therapeutic approaches are safe, effective, and empowering for patients\\".

As of January 2018, Apartment List had over 4 million units on its platform. Over 40 U.S. cities are represented on the site, with 5 million visitors per month. Apartment List uses a business model that only charges properties for listings that have been rented. Co-founders, CEO John Kobs and COO Chris Erickson, launched Apartment List in September 2011 at TechCrunch Disrupt. After having negative experiences as both renters and landlords, Kobs and Erickson wanted to create a platform that would improve the rental experience. Initially, Apartment List partnered with other online rental companies to provide a service where a user could search a number of sites simultaneously. In 2014, Apartment List decided to change to the current ‘pay-per-move-in’ model to focus the experience on the renter. Apartment List has had three series of fundraising efforts. In November 2013, Series A funding raised $23 million, with lead investor Matrix Partners. Series B funding in November 2016 raised $30 million, with lead investor Canaan Partners, and Series C funding raised $50 million with Passport Capital in November 2017. The last round of funding is being used to increase the property listings in smaller buildings and single-family homes. The funding has been used to make new hires, with the company appointing a new VP of Engineering - Paw Anderson, who previously worked for Uber. Apartment List's 4 million properties can be accessed either directly through the Apartment List site or on a mobile app. In late 2017, Apartment List partnered with Facebook Marketplace, Homes.com, and Realtor.com. The service is free for renters. Larger, professionally-managed properties are charged a variable fee. By using a mixture of questions, manual filters,photos and maps, the potential renter is provided customized search recommendations and is guided through the renting process. The listings are based on these preferences and any changes in price are updated in real time. Each listing that appears on Apartment List has been verified to ensure transparency and accuracy. Landlords and building managers are connected to serious potential renters and they only pay a fee once a renter has moved into their new home. The Apartment List Rentonomics blog publishes rent data studies for the entire United States, as well as specific local markets.

Dola Purnima is celebrated in the belief that Lord Lingaraja arrives to this Matha to take pankti bhogo (community lunch) on Dola Purnima.  Location  The matha faces east and is located in the Rathagada Chowk, Old Town, Bhubaneswar. One can approach this monastery on the right side of the Ratha road leading from Lingaraj temple to Mausima temple at a distance of 30 meters from the northern gateway of Lingaraja. The Endowment Commission took over the matha in 1970. The Matha belonged to Sankaracharya Sampradaya. The wooden logs used for preparing the chariot of Lord Lingaraj are consecrated here in the monastery before used by the carpenters. Burial temples of Sivatirtha matha The temples are located within the Matha precinct in the eastern end. The matha is situated in front of the northern entrance of Lingaraj temple across the Ratha road. There are thirteen burial temples arranged in one and half rows. In the rear row there are nine temples, of which four temples from the northern side have been encroached upon by a private compound wall. The temples on the south are partially buried. Of the four temples in the front row three are buried up to the gandi while the fourth one is buried up to the bada. The burial temples are square on plan. On elevation these temples are of pidha order having bada, gandi and mastaka. The gandi of these temples have three receding tiers.

The National Museum of the American People is a proposed museum to be built in Washington, D.C. Its plan is to tell the story about the making of the American People including the migration and immigration stories of all Americans. The National Museum of the American People will use the museum story-telling approach used by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and the National Museum of African American History and Culture. Overview Proposed by the Coalition for the National Museum of the American People, composed of more than 250 ethnic, nationality and genealogical private non-profit organizations as of 2019, the museum \\"will tell the story of every American ethnic and cultural group coming to this land and nation from every corner of the world, from the first people through today.\\" The museum also has the support of 19 organizations that focus on refugees and immigration including the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops Secretariat of Cultural Diversity in the Church, National Association of Evangelicals and Church World Service. History The Coalition for the National Museum of the American People was created by Sam Eskenazi, former Director of Public Information for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. The concept for the museum originated in the late 90s when Eskenazi was passing the USDA Headquarters Building, the only office building on the National Mall. Eskenazi asked and answered a question to himself: > \\"If this were a museum, what kind of museum could it be?\\" The answer: a > museum that would tell the stories of all of the peoples coming to this > land. I came up with a name for the museum on the spot - the National Museum > of the American People. It is a testament to the need for the museum that > many people, when told about the proposal, were surprised that such a museum > doesn't already exist. On September 11, 2008, Congressman Maurice Hinchey introduced a bill, H.R. 6883, into the 110th United States Congress to \\"establish a commission to study the establishment of the National Museum of the American People...\\". Eskenazi then started a coalition of private not-for-profit ethnic and nationality groups to support the creation of the museum in 2009. The organization announced this project at a press event in February, 2011 and began gathering support in Congress. Beginning that year, Rep. Jim Moran, Sen. Brian Schatz and various cosponsors have introduced into the United States Congress legislation that would support a bipartisan study on the creation of such a museum without using any federal taxpayer funds.(1) (2) (3) Shortly thereafter the Washington City Paper named it the \\"Best Museum That Doesn't Exist Yet\\" in the newspaper's \\"Best Of D.C. 2011\\" issue. In May 2011, Congressman Jim Moran agreed to be the originating sponsor of a resolution calling for a study group, expressing concerns about balkanization of the National Mall. In partnership with Eskenazi's Coalition for the National Museum of the American People, Moran introduced into the 112th United States Congress on July 7, 2011, a concurrent resolution, H. Con. Res. 63, \\"supporting the formation of a bipartisan Presidential Commission to study the establishment of a National Museum of the American People\\".(1) (2) On March 19, 2013, Moran reintroduced the resolution H. Con. Res. 27 into the 113th Congress. It had 48 bipartisan sponsors. In 2015, Senator Brian Schatz introduced a similar resolution into the Senate. Location planning is limited by the lack of available locations in the central Washington, DC area, whether for the NMAP or another museum. One site proposed for the museum is an overlook at the south end of L'Enfant Promenade that now contains the National Park Service's Benjamin Banneker Park, a half mile (800 m) south of the Smithsonian Institution's \\"Castle\\" Building on the National Mall.(1) (2) (3) Museum contents and exhibitions Logo of the Coalition for the National Museum of the American People The museum project creators have proposed a number of components to be considered for a final institution. Among these are a permanent exhibition (tentatively called The Story of the American People), a Center for the Advanced Study of the American People drawing upon a group of over 145 scholars who have offered their support to the project, a National Genealogical Center, an Education and Resource Center and an archival library of American Migration and Immigration. In addition, the permanent collection is intended to be presented in a narrative manner, told in four chapters:(1) (2) Chapter I, The First Peoples Come, 20,000 before present (est.)-1607 Chapter II, The Nation Takes Form, 1607-1820 Chapter III, The Great In-Gathering, 1820-1924 Chapter IV, And Still They Come, 1924–present References External links  * National Museum of the American People home page Category:Proposed museums in the United States Category:Proposed buildings and structures in the United States Category:History of immigration to the United States Category:Immigrants to the United States ","title":"National Museum of the American People"},{"id":"33177019","text":"Paint It Golden is the third album by Lydia.

It includes 17 nif genes, and is situated between the his and the Shi-A operon of the bacterium. The Nif Regulon The nif regulon comprises 7 operons: nifRLA, nifJ, nifHDK, nifEN, nifUSVM, nifWF, nifBQ. nifRLA operon: The tight expression regulation of the nitrogen fixation (nif) genes is mediated by the products of the nifRLA operon. NifA activates transcription of nif genes by the alternative form of RNA polymerase, s54-holoenzyme. NifL is a negative regulatory gene which inhibits the activation of other nif genes by nifA protein. NifR is a repressor binding site, between the promoter of the nifRLA operon and the nifL gene. No protein coded by nifR gene has been found. nifHDK operon: comprises three structural genes: nifK nifD and nifH. nifK encodes for B-subunit of Component 1 of nitrogenase. nifD encodes for alpha subunit of component 1 of nitrogenase. nifH encodes for component 2 of nitrogenase. nifEN and nifBQ operons: This comprises nifE, nifN, nifB and nifQ genes which are responsible for formation of a functional Mo-Fe protein. (Mo-Fe-co catalytic site for nitrogenase.) nifQ is not absolutely essential. nifJ operon:The nifJ gene encodes for the pyruvate-flavodoxin-oxidoreductase protein. This enzyme is involved in electron transfer to nitrogenase. nifUSVM operon: The nifS, nifV and nifM genes encode for a protein that is required to process component II. Function of the nifU gene is undetermined. nifWF operon: The function of nifW is undetermined. The nifF gene mediates electron transfer from nifJ protein to Fe protein of nitrogenase. Regulation  The Nif regulon is regulated in response to a variety of environmental signals to ensure nitrogen-fixation only occurs when necessary: =Oxygen= The action site of O2 is the nifL protein which is basically a flavoprotein with FAD as the redox sensing cofactor. Fnr (fumarate nitrate reduction regulator) is the signal transduction molecule which transduces the oxygen status to the nifL protein. In the absence of oxygen, the nifL protein is in its reduced form (FADH2 as the cofactor ) and is unable to inhibit the action of nifA protein. In oxygen's presence, oxidized nifL (FAD as the cofactor) inhibits nifA protein and there by turns off all the other operons. =NH4+= The presence of ammonium ions in large amounts in the environment inhibits the transcription of nitrogenase and all the other nif genes. NH4+ acts as a co-repressor to the glutamine synthetase by modifying it covalently(adenylylation). This modifies enzyme binds to the nifR region of the nifRLA operon and prevents the transcription of the genes, nifL and nifA. So, there is no initiation of transcription of the other genes by the σ-RNA polymerase. =Glnk protein= In the nitrogen limiting growth conditions, the inhibition of nifA protein by the nifL protein is prevented by the antagonizing action of Glnk protein on the nifL proteins. A homologue of the NifL-NifA regulatory gene system has not been found among the eukaryotes. However Entamoeba histolytica was found to possess a simplified and non-redundant NIF (nitrogen fixation)-like system for the Fe-S cluster formation, composed of only a catalytic component, NifS, and a scaffold component, NifU. EhNifS and EhNifU were found to be necessary and sufficient for Fe-S clusters of non-nitrogenase Fe-S proteins to form under anaerobic conditions. This is the first demonstration of the presence and biological significance of the NIF-like system in eukaryotes.

The text, written on vellum, is in a fragmentary condition. In some parts it represents the Old Latin version, while follows Jerome's Vulgate in others. The codex is a palimpsest. From its location in León, this palimpsest is sometimes referred to as the Codex Legionensis; but this name is more commonly applied to the 10th-century Vulgate Bible at the Basílica de San Isidoro, León (133 in the Beuron system). Nor should the León palimpsest be confused with another 10th-century pandect in León, of which the second volume is conserved in the cathedral archive and is number 193 in the Beuron system.  Description  The text of the New Testament has survived on 40 leaves of the codex. The leaves have measures 37 by 24 cm. The text is written in 2 columns of 38-55 lines per page. The text is written in a semi- uncial hand, in Visigothic characters. The fragments contain texts of James 4:4 - 1 Peter 3:14; 1 John 1:5 - 3 John 10; Acts 7:27-11:13; 14:21-17:25. It contains also a fragment of the Books of Maccabees.Bruce M. Metzger, The Early Versions of the New Testament, Oxford University Press, 1977, p. 316. The text of the codex represent a Vulgate with Old Latin elements, especially in the First Epistle of John. The text is close to the Liber Comicus.

After the Six-Day War in 1967, it has been placed under Israeli control, and the site and facilities are administered by the Israeli Civil Administration and the Israeli Ministry of Tourism as part of a national park. It is the western part of the traditional site of the baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist (), in Arabic Al-Maghtas, a name which was historically used for the pilgrimage site on both sides of the river. It is also traditionally considered to be the place where the Israelites crossed the Jordan River, and the prophet Elijah ascended to heaven. Etymology The Arabic name of the baptism site is Al- Maghtas meaning \\"immersion\\" and, by extension, \\"baptism\\", used for an area stretching over both banks of the river. The Jordanian side uses the names Al- Maghtas, Bethany beyond the Jordan and Baptism(al) Site, while the western part is known as Qasr al-Yahud. The nearby Greek Orthodox Monastery of St John the Baptist has a castle-like appearance (thus qasr, \\"castle\\"), and tradition holds that the Israelites crossed the river at this spot (thus al-Yahud, \\"of the Jews\\"). Location Qasr al-Yahud is located in the West Bank, a little southeast from Jericho and is part of the Jericho Governorate of Palestine. History =Antiquity= Qasr al-Yahud is close to the ancient road and river ford connecting Jerusalem, via Jericho, to several Transjordanian biblical sites such as Madaba, Mount Nebo and the King's Highway. According to Procopius (writing c. 560 CE), Emperor Justinian I had a cistern constructed here.Procopius, 1888, p. 149: \\"in the monastery of St. John beside the Jordan, a cistern\\" In 1883 it was described as \\"still visible, in almost perfect condition\\".Conder and Kitchener, 1883, SWPIII, p. 177 =19th and 20th century= Russian Orthodox women visiting the site (1913) The west side of the traditional baptism site became again a target for mass pilgrimage toward the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century. Later in the century, a large number of churches and monasteries were built between the old Greek Orthodox Monastery of St John the Baptist and the river, an area that became known as the \\"Land of the Monasteries\\". It comprised Catholic (Franciscan), Greek, Ethiopian Orthodox, Syriac, Russian, Romanian, and Coptic churches. =After 1967= The modern site reopened in 2011 after being closed since the 1967 Six-Day War. The restoration project was approved before the 2000 millennium celebrations but was delayed due to the Second Intifada and flooding in the region in 2003. In 2000, Pope John Paul II held a private worship at the site. Qasr al-Yahud is administered by the Israeli Civil Administration and the Israeli Ministry of Tourism. Before the site became accessible, baptisms took place at Yardenit.

She arrives just in time to save Rana from Windy, but despite her and Ouka's enhancements, Lucy looks down on them, stating their fake \\"Legendary Stigmata\\" are not enough to defeat her sisters. ; :A Valkyrie with shoulder-length brown hair, hailing from Italy. She has a shy personality and a large chest. Her Plasma Weapon is of the Stigma Satellite System type. =Other Pandoras= ; :The first Pandora, known as the Mother of all Pandoras, as all stigmata used by other Pandoras and Limiters were fragments of her body. Her \\"holy remains\\" reside deep within West Genetics' underground chamber, the , and was the main target of the Nova in the tenth Nova Clash. She was the one who warned mankind about the Nova's invasion. Her origins are a mystery as she first materialized on Earth before Gengo Aoi. She is the mother of Ryuuichi Aoi, thus being Kazuya and Kazuha's grandmother as well, which could explain the high concentration of stigmata tissue into their bodies, and her DNA was used for the creation of the Legendary Pandoras as well. She was reintroduced to Scarlett Ohara by Gengo while he told her why he couldn't return Scarlett's feelings, he reveals the Top Secret: Maria is alive and is cognizant of what is going on. She revealed her knowledge to Scarlett, and gave her the incentive to finish the Plasma Stigmata project. Legendary Pandoras The first Pandoras who were created from the DNA of Gengo Aoi and Maria Lancelot. They are known as the . Their bodies are composed mostly of stigmata tissue. In addition to Chiffon Fairchild and Lucy Renault, there are three Legendary Pandoras who were placed in suspended animation until the twelfth Nova Clash when they were released to defeat the Novas. ; :Cassandra has long blonde hair that she uses a large jagged hair clip to hold back. As Kazuya's aunt, she took care of him until he was two years old, and still treats him that way, offering him to feast on her breasts. In battles, she wields an even larger version of Satellizer's Nova Blood, and can fire particle beams that devastate enemy Nova. She saves Kazuya from the Busters and manages to heal everyone, but once Jessica Edwin uses her Anti-Freezing to stop her and Isabella Lucas tries to kill her, she remains unscathed, but the Anti-Freezing field causes her to hear an alien message to kill everyone that is not one of them, at which she then is classified as a N3 Nova. She effortlessly stands the attacks of the Busters and after permanently blowing the arm of Isabella, she acts as a beacon to summon five N3 Nova. ; :Windy has pink hair styled in twin tails; she has a bright and energetic personality, and is rarely seen without a smile on her face, even during the midst of battle. In the twelfth Nova Clash, she takes an energy blast from the Nova commander at point-blank range, but does not sustain injury, and then lops off the commander's head with a simple swing of her large mallet. She heals the fallen Pandoras, restoring Charles's limbs, and even reviving Roxanne who self-destructed the upper half of her body. When the Busters attack, she has the upper hand against Petty Layner, but when Sawatari uses her Anti-Freezing technique, she and Teslad become N3 Novas. As the Busters flee, Nova Windy beheads a Chevalier Pandora with her hands in front of Rana, and faces the Valkyries, with Rana personally facing her. ; :She has medium length dark purple hair. Her weapon is a pair of bladed tonfas that can unleash sonic waves to cut down her enemies. She stays quiet, preferring to just stare intently when she wants something. In the attack from the Busters, she, too, transforms into an N3 Nova as a result of the Anti-Freezing from Sawatari, ending up fighting her sister Lucy. Busters A group of highly skilled Pandoras that were relieved from duty because of their criminal acts; they are gathered by the Chevalier leader in an attempt to assassinate Gengo Aoi after the latter's betrayal. Equipped with the unstable and experimental Plasma Stigmata, their abilities are considered to be comparable with Chiffon Fairchild's, and they are enabled with a powerful \\"Anti-Freezing\\" ability comparable to Kazuha Aoi's. The Busters are recruited by an ex- Chevalier leader, Raddox Phantomime. However, their mission turns to the worse when they face the Legendary Pandoras, who transform themselves into Novas thanks to an unexpected reaction to their Anti-Freezing, becoming a threat to friends and foes alike. ; :Petty is introduced as a prisoner in Arizona with a 210-year sentence for attacking a Pandora until she was unable to move, and killing her Limiter. She has shoulder-length dark blue hair. Prideful, foul- mouthed and sadistic with a habit of taunting her opponents. Her Volt weapon is a pair of reinforced gauntlets. In the invasion of West Genetics, she challenges and easily beats Sawatari to assume leadership of the Busters. She then beats the Genetics Pandoras, but when she faces the Legendary Pandoras, she is humiliated by Windy May, and flees when the Legendary Pandoras go berserk. After seeing that Sawatari ditched her, she tries to fight her again, but is easily defeated and then killed. ; :Incarcerated for killing her parents and attempting to murder her brother, Jessica was serving a 350-year sentence in New Alcatraz when she is recruited into Busters. Her weapon is a pair of knives. She rarely speaks, and her cold expression hardly changes. In the invasion of West Genetics, she and Isabella fight the Genetics Pandoras, easily slicing off Ticy's arms. But when she uses Anti-Freezing on Cassandra, the latter turns into an N3 Nova. She is unable to beat Nova Cassandra, who then converts Jessica into a Nova. ; :Formerly a nurse before being recruited to be a Pandora, Isabel was sentenced for a 500-year term after being convicted of killing thirteen newborns. She has long blonde hair and a tanned complexion. Her Volt weapon is a cannon that she holds under her arm; she wields a second cannon, and can combine it to form a directed beam cutting attack. After Jessica defeats Ticy, Isabella then attempts to rape Abel, Ticy's Limiter. She finds Satellizer and the other Pandoras to be weak, slicing their limbs, but is surprised by Cassandra's ability. When Cassandra becomes an N3 Nova, she realizes that she is outmatched, and flees when Cassandra summons five more N3 Novas and transforms her fellow Buster Jessica into one. Isabella later returns as part of the army sent by the European and Asian branches of Chevalier to bring down West Genetics once and for all. ; :The only member of Busters that was not incarcerated, Sawatari was discharged from the Chevalier after some incidents in which she killed two Pandoras, but in self-defense when the Pandoras attacked her for seducing their Limiters, and then end up killing themselves with their own weapons or stigmata going out of control. She also \\"killed\\" two civilian women in the same manner. She has long pink hair. When she was in the 25th generation of West Genetics, she had eight stigmata, and was at the top of her class except for Suna Lee. She seduces and sleeps with Lee's Limiter, but Lee does not fall for her trap. When Lee responds with a smile indicating that she has the upper hand, Sawatari is traumatized to the point where she can no longer enjoy sex with men, so she makes it her life's mission to seek revenge on her. : When the Busters invade West Genetics, she initially lets herself be defeated by Petty, who becomes the leader of the group. However, during the subsequent battles, she proves to be the strongest of the four Busters, breaking Satellizer and Arnett's Volt Weapons with her bare hands, easily slaughtering any Chevalier Pandora that got in her way, all with a smile on her face. When the Legendary Pandoras turn into Novas, she flees, but when Petty confronts her about it, they have another fight where she easily defeats and then slices her head in two. She reaches Gengo, who is guarded by Lee, and agrees to duel Lee first before attacking Gengo. Although she gets the upper hand in beating Lee down, she was stalled by Amelia Evans then was defeated by Lee and is captured. Other characters ; : The Nova are the primary antagonists in the series, introduced as giant aliens from another dimension that resemble armored humans. They come in different types such as Type-R and Type-S. Early in the series, it is mentioned that only one of them has appeared at a time; each encounter has been logged as a Nova Clash. They are able to cast Freezing fields, which are only able to be countered by the Pandoras and their Limiters. In the eighth Nova Clash, Kazuha Aoi sacrifices herself to fight off the Nova. In the tenth Nova Clash, multiple Type-S Novas appear and attack East Genetics, where they are able to capture Pandoras, and turn them into Nova Forms under their control. Their goal in the Clash is to reach the body of Maria Lancelot, the first Pandora. In the E-Pandora story, Amelia Evans loses control and transforms into an “unknown-type” Nova. In the Valkyrie story, it is revealed that the Nova attempted to communicate with Gengo Aoi. During the twelfth Nova Clash, it is revealed that the Chevalier uses classifications for the humanoid-sized Nova such as N1 for the original ones, and afterwards, classify the saurian Novas as N2, and the human commanders as Pandora Class, or N3. ; : :Satellizer's late biological mother and Howard's mistress. She and Satellizer were taken in by the El Bridgets when Satellizer was nine years old and Noel still had a terminal medical condition. ; : :The matriarch of the El Bridget family, Satellizer's stepmother, and Louis and Violet's biological mother. Initially, she despised Satellizer and her mother when she discovered the truth of her husband's affair. But Olivia later on regretted her actions towards them. After the incident at Bali she calls Satellizer and tells her that she has come to consider Satellizer as her daughter and genuinely wants to make amends with her. ; : :Satellizer's older half-sister and the eldest sibling of the el Bridget family. Unlike the rest of her family, Violet treated Satellizer and her mother with respect and cared about her younger half-sister. She was unaware of Satellizer's abuse from Louis until later on, and moved her away once she found out the truth. She manages some of the El Bridget hotel resorts, including one in Bali. ; : :The patriarch of the el Bridget family and President and CEO of the . He became the head of the el Bridget family when he was only 18, and he was already dating his future wife Olivia at that time. He has worked with Gengo since the time both the Pandora and Valkyrie Projects where first suggested. ; :Executive Director of Seiga Heavy Industries, a private company that is known for creating artificial training Nova, as well as the Injection Stigmata for the newly developed Valkyries. After the twelfth Nova Clash, she is forced to work under Gengo Aoi to help him accomplish his plan to create an organization independent from Chevalier, as she knows she lacks the power to oppose him. She then recruits Ohara to help her on the Legendary Stigmata plan. ; :Kazuya and Kazuha's father, the husband of Orie Aoi and the only son of Gengo and Maria Lancelot, who died years before the story began. A kind, caring and cheerful man, who valued his family's future before that of mankind's, in stark contrast to his father, who had always made sacrifices in the name of protecting mankind. As the first human born with a stigmatic body, he was chosen by his father to lead mankind against the \\"Transient Will\\" that intents to wipe out all humanity, but after the death of his wife he refused to accept the mission given to him by Gengo and committed suicide instead. ; :Kazuha and Kazuya's mother, the wife of Ryuuichi Aoi and the aunt of Ouka Tenjouin, who died years before the story began. An insecure and unstable woman who greatly resented Cassandra and her closeness with her children, specially Kazuya, which led her to have a fight with her husband, in which she refused to acknowledge Kazuya as her son, to the point of attempting to killing him, forcing Kazuha to kill her own mother in order to protect her baby brother. ; :A Pandora and the only member of the Arcadia Project. She's the daughter of Ryuuichi and Cassandra, making her Kazuya's younger half-sister. Kept cryogenically frozen since her birth, she was awakened by the battle between Kazuya and her aunts. She faced her aunts Teslad and Windy May and defeated them by draining their powers, ending the 13th Nova Clash. Arcadia wields a pair of massive gauntlets that have a resemblance to Chiffon Fairchild's machined looking version of Anti-Nova. After absorbing their power, her body develop into that of a buxom woman, very similar to her mother Cassandra.

He was a prominent and sometimes controversial advocate of complementary medicine in the UK. Education and career Lewith graduated from Trinity College, Cambridge in medicine and biochemistry. He then went on to Westminster Medical School to complete his clinical studies and began working clinically in 1974. In 1977 Lewith became a member of the Royal College of Physicians. Then, in 1980, he became a member of the Royal College of General Practitioners and, later in 1999, was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians. At the time of his death, he was a Professor of Health Research in the Department of Primary Care at the University of Southampton and a director of the International Society for Complementary Medicine Research. Lewith obtained a significant number of institutional peer reviewed fellowships at doctoral and post-doctoral level and was principal investigator or collaborator in research grants totally over £5 million during the last decade. Between 1980 and 2010, Lewith was a partner at the Centre for Complementary and Integrated Medicine, a private practice providing complementary treatments with clinics in London and Southampton. Research Lewith's research has ranged across several areas of complementary medicine. This has involved examining how complementary techniques might be investigated and the development of new research methodology to evaluate complementary techniques, as well as the collection of primary research data concerning a variety of complementary techniques. His primary research has included examinations of the clinical effects of acupuncture and possible acupuncture mechanisms, the effects of distant and present healing, the clinical effects of homoeopathy, the effects and activity of herbal medicine, the clinical effects of the Alexander technique and the use and effectiveness of a variety of nutritional supplements and herbs. Lewith has also co-authored several studies indicating a lack of specific efficacy in some complementary therapies and techniques. He has also investigated how and why people use complementary medicine and is currently involved in two major EU projects. One looking at the use, delivery and possible future research strategies of complementary medicine in Europe and another relating to the use and investigation of Chinese herbal medicines within a European context. In his career, Lewith has published over 330 peer-reviewed publications, authored several books and contributed to several others. Broadcasting, advocacy and controversy Lewith was a council member of the Foundation for Integrated Medicine and later a foundation fellow of the Prince of Wales' Foundation for Integrated Health, a controversial charity that promoted complementary medicine and has since closed. The Foundation for Integrated Medicine became the Prince of Wales' Foundation for Integrated Health in 2000. In an article, Lewith described his research unit at the University of Southampton as having played an important role in the development of the foundation, with especial regard to its research and development agenda. In 1997, Lewith presented a documentary series examining complementary medicine for Channel 4 called Natural Born Healers. The series won a Royal Television Society award for its programme on herbalism. However, the series also drew criticism from Dr. Peter May and colleagues at the Grove Medical Practice in Southampton, who had cooperated with the programme, in a complaint to HealthWatch. A book of the same title as the documentary series and co-authored by Lewith accompanied the series. In 2004 he participated in a radio series presented by Anna Ford about complementary medicine co-produced by BBC Radio 4 and the Open University, titled The Other Medicine. A 2006 BBC documentary series, Alternative Medicine, was criticised by several people, including Lewith, in the Guardian over a controversial sequence in which acupuncture appeared to be used as a replacement for general anaesthesia during open heart surgery. Lewith had participated in the series as an advisor, but criticised the programme for inappropriate sensationalism and poor interpretation of science. In criticisms published in the British Medical Journal, both Jane Cassidy and David Colquhoun criticise Lewith, claiming that he prescribes homoeopathy despite having written papers that conclude it doesn't work. Lewith has conducted research suggesting that the homeopathic remedy has no effect, and other research suggesting that, while the homeopathic medicine itself does not appear to have an effect, the homeopathic consultation has a clinically relevant non-specific effect.

Personal  Misri Khan Orakzai was born in Pakistan in the year 1962. Orakzai was married with a total of six sons and five daughters.  Career  Misri Khan Orakzai had been an Urdu-language journalist almost 30 years at the time of his murder. Early in his career, he worked for several different daily newspapers, such as Jinnah and Daily Ausaf in Islamabad and Daily Mashriq in Peshawar.

It was created by Mike \\"Jormungard\\" Scandizzo of Clan Loki's Minions. The mod was released the day after the Quake II source code was released and soon became very popular. Its defining feature was the use of an off-hand grappling hook, which allowed the player to fly through the air while still being able to fire their weapon.  Gameplay  LMCTF is a Capture the Flag game. There are two teams, Red and Blue. The goal is to enter the other teams base, steal their flag and return it safely to your teams flag inside of your base. The team with the most flag captures at the end of the match wins the game.  Features  LMCTF added many new features to the original Quake 2 game. The off-hand grappling hook, power-up runes (Haste, Strength, Resist and Regeneration), plasma rifle, team radio and voice sounds, custom models, custom skins, custom maps, tournament mode and observer cam options are just a few of the additions.  History  The mod was originally released by Jormungard of Clan LM. After its release, other programmers, modelers and mappers joined the team. At release 3.0 on April 1, 1998, the team included Jormungrad and Surt as lead programmers, and John \\"Mr. White\\" Keffer, John \\"Der Kommissar\\" Staats and Keith \\"Vampire\\" Mercer as lead mappers. Hati joined the team as a programmer for release 4.0 (July 15, 1998), with Dan \\"Batstone\\" Markham taking over the role for the 5.0 release when the previous programmers left for work at Blizzard. Der Kommissar later joined them. The mod included many maps from the wider Quake II community in its releases, totaling 30 after the 5.0 release. There were many tournaments for LMCTF clans, including Ragnarok, Ascension, Narf!, Wargrounds, Online Gaming League (OGL) and the Free Agent Fest, but the biggest was the Ragnarok and Ragnarok 2 tournaments. The Ragnarok was the first community-wide tournament which featured a round-robin regular season followed by a single- elimination playoffs. This tourney started in 1998 with a second season following in 1999. The first-season winner was Harbingers of Despair [HD]. The second season Ragnarok winner was Pathetic Totally Harmless. In August 2011, a revival started in the U.S. and European LMCTF communities with organized matches and play. This revival resulted in 6 mini tournaments with as many as 6 teams competing for the 'Beatdown' championship. In May 2020, another revival started resulting in the continuation of the 'Beatdown' tournament to season 7.  Maps  The mod featured 30 original maps in its final iteration. There were also several community made map pack additions released, including XMaps2, Lockheed's Tombs, Nachos Map Pack and the Kiukku Pack. These map packs added an additional 50 maps to the available selection.

She was one of thousands of women from Japanese occupied Taiwan who were forced into sexual slavery as comfort women by the Japanese military during World War II. Liu Huang became the first Taiwanese woman to sue the Japanese government for compensation and a public apology in 1999, a move which united her with eight other comfort women survivors. Her public campaign and push for compensation earned her the nickname, Grandma A-tao. Biography =World War II captivity= Liu Huang, who was 19 years old at the time, entered into the Japanese nursing corps in 1942 during World War II. She was promised work as a nurse in the medical field for the Japanese forces, but instead was pressed into sexual slavery as a comfort woman for Japanese troops. Liu Huang was sent to Indonesia where she was immediately forced to work at a battlefield brothel as a comfort woman as soon as she disembarked from the transport ship. She was seriously wounded during heavy fighting just three days after her arrival in Indonesia. Liu Huang had to have a hysterectomy owing to the extent of her injuries. She survived, but was forced to work as a comfort woman for the Japanese for the next three years, despite her extensive wounds. =Post- War= Liu Huang returned to Taiwan in 1945 after the Surrender of Japan and the end of World War II. However, she kept experiences as a comfort woman a secret following the war. Liu Huang married a retired Taiwanese soldier and adopted a child with her husband. However, her experience as a comfort woman left a deep emotional scar. =Activism= The experiences of survivors of the comfort women program were largely ignored for decades in post-war Asia. The issue finally emerged into the public sphere during the 1980s, when a group of survivors in neighboring South Korea filed several lawsuits against the Japanese government. Documents were uncovered in 1991 which forced the Japanese government to issue an apology and \\"remorse to all those, irrespective of place of origin, who suffered immeasurable pain and incurable psychological wounds\\" to Korean comfort women. Liu Huang, who had remained largely silent about her own experiences for decades, was encouraged by the actions of the former South Korean comfort women. In 1995, Japan tried to quietly pay former comfort women compensation for war crimes committed against them through a program called the \\"Asian Women's Fund\\". Most survivors refused the private offer. That same year, Liu Huang, who was inspired by the South Korean legal movement, began meeting other Taiwanese survivors through the Taipei Women's Foundation, an organization aimed at advocating the rights of former comfort women. In 1999, Liu Huang became the first former Taiwanese comfort woman to file an international lawsuit against the Japanese government and publicly demand an apology for her forced imprisonment and sexual slavery during the war. Her lawsuit united her with eight fellow Taiwanese comfort women survivors. When asked about her experience, she replied, \\"It is not us, but the Japanese government that should feel ashamed,\\" echoing the slogans of the South Korean women who had sued during the 1980s. Each of Liu Huang's lawsuits were dismissed in the Japanese courts, beginning in 2002 with the loss of her first case. In an interview about the dismissals, Liu Huang told a journalist, \\"We are all cherished daughters in the eyes of our parents. Since the Japanese army robbed us of our virginity, it is not too much to demand an apology from such a government.\\" The Taipei Women's Rescue Foundation, which supported Liu Huang, changed tactics and collaborated with legal groups in Japan and South Korea to advocate for legislation in the Diet to address the comfort women's grievances. The proposal for compensation was introduced to parliament by the Democratic Party of Japan, which was the main opposition party at the time, but the legislation was defeated. Liu Huang's most recent lawsuit was filed in 2010 in Tokyo and the case is still pending, as of September 2011. Liu Huang died from a heart attack on 1 September 2011, at the age of 90. Her death left just ten surviving Taiwanese comfort women, awaiting an apology. Her funeral was held on 10 September 2011, in the southern city of Kaohsiung, Taiwan. The city of Taipei has announced plans to build a memorial to the women in Datong District, Taipei.

In the attack, two IDF soldiers and two Palestinian militantsQ&A;: Israeli soldier held in Gaza, BBC News, Monday, 25 June 2007. were killed, four IDF soldiers were wounded one of whom was Gilad Shalit who was captured and taken to the Gaza Strip. Hamas' military wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, claimed responsibility, together with the Popular Resistance Committees (which includes members of Fatah, Islamic Jihad, and Hamas), and a previously unknown group calling itself the Army of Islam. They stated the raid was in retaliation to an Israeli shelling and a series of air raids that had killed 22 Palestinians earlier that month. The abduction of Shalit caused Israel to launch Operation \\"Summer Rains\\" which consisted of a series of incursions into Gaza. The operation failed to retrieve Shalit who was eventually released on 18 October 2011 as part of a prisoner swap. It was the first time since the capture of Nachshon Wachsman in 1994 that Palestinian militants had captured an Israeli soldier. – Cpl Gilad Shalit, 19: First Israeli soldier captured by Palestinians since 1994 – Amnesty International, the human rights group, called for all hostages to be released [...].  Background  In February 2005, the Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon announced a ceasefire which effectively ended the Second Intifada. Hamas unilaterally agreed to abide by the ceasefire. Under the direction of Sharon, Israel withdrew from Gaza in September 2005. To international surprise, Hamas won the Palestinian elections in January 2006, which were declared democratic by observers. The 'Quartet' demanded that Hamas renounce violence, recognize Israel, and accept previous Israeli-Palestinian agreements, which Hamas refused to do, resulting in aid being withheld. Israel imposed a blockade and sanctions on Gaza, and withheld customs revenue. Hamas had announced a ceasefire in 2005 and until 10 June 2006. On 8 February 2006 Hamas' leader Khaled Meshaal offered a \\"long-term ceasefire\\" with Israel if the latter would withdraw to 1967 boundaries. Hours previously, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, had promised never to give up control of key components of the occupied West Bank. However, according to the IDF, Hamas was still implicated in rocket attacks against Israeli civilians. On 8 June 2006, while the cease- fire was still in effect, Jamal Abu Samhadana, Hamas' Inspector General in the Ministry of the Interior and founder of the Popular Resistance Committees, was assassinated by an Israeli air-strike on the Salah al-Dein Brigades training camp in Gaza which killed three other Palestinians. It was the fourth time Israel had tried to kill him. His supporters threatened to avenge his death. The IDF said Samhadana was planning an attack on Israel. The next day rockets Palestinian militants in Gaza fired rockets into southern Israel and a few hours later an explosion, which the IDF attributed ot its shelling of a reported launch site, killed a Palestinian family of eight and injured at least 30 others. Hamas formally withdrew from its 16-month ceasefire in response to the explosion.  The attack and the capture  On Sunday morning, 25 June 2006, at about 5:30 am (GMT+2) a squad of Palestinian militants from the Gaza Strip crossed the border into Israel via a 300-meter-long tunnel they had dug near the Kerem Shalom border crossing.Two soldiers killed, one missing in Kerem Shalom terror attack. Mfa.gov.il. Retrieved on 29 August 2011. The militants surfaced in Israeli territory shielded by a row of trees, and came up behind IDF border positions facing Gaza. As militants from within the Gaza Strip bombarded Israeli positions with mortar and anti-tank fire, the militant squad split into three cells. One cell aligned itself behind a Merkava Mark III tank, another behind a concrete watchtower, and another behind an armored personnel carrier. The militants simultaneously opened fire on their targets. The militants that attacked the tank blew open its rear door with an RPG. The tank's gunner, Corporal Gilad Shalit, was wounded by the RPG blast, suffering a broken left hand and a light shoulder wound. Two of the militants then approached the tank. The RPG hit caused the tank to go up in flames, and its fire extinguisher system was activated. However, the engine stopped working and the ventilation system failed to work as a result, creating suffocating conditions inside. The tank's commander and driver climbed out to escape, and were gunned down by the militants. A militant then climbed onto the tank's turret and threw grenades into the tank, wounding another crew member. Shalit climbed out of the tank to escape the suffocating conditions, and as he emerged onto the turret, he saw one of the militants climbing onto the tank, with his AK-47 strapped to his back. Shalit at this point could have easily killed the militant using the .50 caliber machine gun mounted on the turret, but instead surrendered to him. He later told IDF investigators that he was confused and in a state of shock, and thus never thought of shooting him. Shalit was then taken to Gaza with the militants. An Israeli tank soon arrived on the scene and an IDF observation post witnessed their escape, although it was not known at the time that the militants had a captive Israeli soldier with them, and the tank did not open fire in time, as the commander was awaiting permission. When permission was finally granted, the tank opened fire with its machine guns. The squad's third member was positioned near a road, and fired an RPG at an IDF jeep driven by a captain. After the captain returned fire, the militant fled towards a tunnel dug along the fence, throwing grenades. An IDF armored vehicle fired at him, but missed, and he escaped. Two militants attacked the watchtower, raking it with RPG and small- arms fire, wounding two soldiers manning the tower. One militant crept towards the tower and placed an explosive charge next to the bottom doors. The ensuing explosion damaged the tower's communication cables. The militant then attempted to climb the stairs, while the second militant remained on the ground as backup. IDF soldiers in the tower spotted the militant climbing the stairs and opened fire, killing him in the upper part of the stairway. The second militant was spotted by an IDF lookout, and soldiers then opened fire and killed him. The third cell attacked an empty armored personnel carrier placed as a decoy before retreating, firing an RPG which damaged it and caused it to burst into flames.Shay, Shaul: Islamic terror abductions in the Middle East Immediately afterwards the militants made their way back into the Gaza Strip, with Shalit, through the ground after they blew an opening in the security fence and disappeared. As they retreated, the militants left behind explosive charges. Meanwhile, large Israeli military forces arrived at the site and began helping the wounded. The charges left behind by the militants exploded as IDF troops were combing the area, lightly injuring three soldiers. When they reached the tank the soldiers discovered the two bodies and a wounded crewman. When it became clear that the fourth crew member was missing, an abduction alert was declared, and various Israeli forces entered Gaza. = Casualties = Two Israeli soldiers were killed in the operation; Staff Sergeant Pavel Slutzker, 20, of Dimona and Lieutenant Hanan Barak, 20, of Arad and two Palestinian militants; Muhammed Farawneh, 22, of Khan Yunis, Army of Islam member and Hamed Rantisi, 22, of Rafah, Popular Resistance Committees member.  Israeli retaliation  The day after, on 26 June 2006, three Palestinian militant organization took responsibility for the raid; the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades (the armed wing of Hamas), the Popular Resistance Committees organization (which includes members of Fatah, Islamic Jihad, and Hamas) and the Army of Islam and issued a joint statement on 26 June 2006, in which they claimed responsibility for the raid and offered information on Shalit only if Israel agreed to release all female Palestinian prisoners and all Palestinian prisoners under the age of 18, who were held without charges and tried without the right of defense. The New York Times reported at the time that there were 95 Palestinian women and 313 Palestinian children in Israeli Jails. Israel rejected the offer. Two days later, on 28 June 2006, Israel launched Operation Summer Rains. In addition various international bodies conducted diplomatic activity, among them Egypt, in an attempt to release Shalit. Due to the fact that Shalit was a French citizen, France attempted to get him released through diplomatic means. However, the captors, who operated under the orders of Khaled Mashal and the Hamas military leadership, refused to release him. According to David Siegel, a spokesman at the Israeli embassy in Washington, D.C., \\"Israel did everything it could in exhausting all diplomatic options and gave Mahmoud Abbas the opportunity to return the abducted Israeli… This operation can be terminated immediately, conditioned on the release of Gilad Shalit.\\" On the night of 28–29 June 2006, the IDF arrested dozens of Hamas leaders in the West bank, including 20 Palestinian parliament members and eight Palestinian ministers. This retaliation operation was reportedly planned several weeks in advance. On the same day, four Israeli Air Force aircraft flew over Syrian President Bashar Assad's palace in Latakia, as an IDF spokesperson said that Israel views the Syrian leadership as a sponsor of Hamas. On 1 July 2006, Shalit's captors issued another demand to the Israelis, demanding that Israel release an additional 1,000 Palestinian prisoners (in addition to all female and young prisoners, as previously demanded) and end Israel's incursions into Gaza. Two days later, the captors issued a 24-hour ultimatum for meeting their demands, threatening unspecified consequences if Israel refused. Hours after the ultimatum was issued, Israel officially rejected the demands, stating that: \\"there will be no negotiations to release prisoners\\". On 3 July 2006 Shalit's captors made an ultimatum according to which they demanded that Israel must fulfill all of its demands by 4 July 2006 at 6:00 am. However, the captors did not specify exactly what would happen if the demands were not met. The Israeli Prime Minister's office formally rejected the ultimatum. After the ultimatum period expired the Army of Islam group announced that no more information would be released about Shalit's fate. Operation Summer Rains, which failed to achieve its main objective (the release of Shalit), ended on 26 November 2006 when the Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas agreed on a cease-fire, after the Palestinian militancy organizations agreed to stop firing rockets on Sderot and after Israel agreed to cease IDF operations in the Gaza Strip.  Aftermath  Gilad Shalit was released and returned to Israel, while nearly a thousand Palestinian and Arab-Israeli prisoners are being released in exchange, 18 October 2011 Hamas high-ranking commander Abu Jibril Shimali, whom Israel considers responsible for coordinating the abduction of Shalit, was killed during the violent clashes between Hamas and the al-Qaida-affiliated Jund Ansar Allah organization in Gaza in August 2009.Hamas: Head of Al-Qaida affiliate killed in Gaza , Haaretz, 18 August 2009 On 2 October 2009, Israel received a video clip of 2:42 minutes length in which Gilad Shalit was filmed. In exchange, Israel released 20 Palestinian prisoners. During the same day the video clip was broadcast on television channels worldwide. The video, which was published publicly after the Shalit family approval to do so, showed Gilad Shalit in uniform reading a pre-written message, in which he urged the Israeli government to finalize the deal for his release. In addition, during the video clip Shalit stood up for a few seconds and moved towards the camera so that his health condition would be evident in the video, as much as possible. In addition, during the video clip Shalit was holding an Arab newspaper from 14 September 2009 in order to prove that the video was recorded just before its release. Shalit was released in a prisoner exchange on 18 October 2011. The Hamas commander who directed the raid, Raed al Atar, was killed in an Israeli airstrike during the 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict.https://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/08/israeli-strikes- hit-3-top-hamas-leaders.html  Official reactions  ;Involved parties : * Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert stated that Israel held the Palestinian Authority, the Hamas government and President Mahmoud Abbas \\"responsible for this event – with all this implies.\\" * Chief of Staff of the Israel Defense Forces Lt.

In one of the first cases of its kind, Casali gave birth to a child sixteen months after the death of her husband, having been artificially inseminated using his stored frozen sperm. The case, which predated the Warnock Report, gave rise to legal discussions regarding the baby's rights of inheritance, and made front-page news across the world. The birth split public opinion and although Casali received \\"hundreds of letters applauding her bravery\\", there were many who disagreed with her actions, including the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano which wrote that it was \\"against evangelical morality.\\"The Warnock Report , published in 1984, recommended \\"that legislation be introduced to provide that any child born by AIH who was not in utero at the date of the death of its father shall be disregarded for the purposes of succession to and inheritance from the latter.\\" Early career Born Marilyn Judith Grove in Auckland, New Zealand, Casali left home aged nineteen to travel around Australia, Europe and the United States. In 1967 she moved to Los Angeles where she met and began a relationship with Roberto Alfredo Vincenzo Casali, an Italian computer engineer, at a ski-club where they were both taking lessons. Casali had been drawing cartoons of humorous incidents on the ski slopes, which Roberto encouraged, and she soon began adding cartoon illustrations to messages which she left for him. The very first drawing was created as a \\"signature\\" to a note, and represented Casali herself with freckles, large eyes and long fair hair. She said later of these cartoons: \\"I began making little drawings to express how I felt... It was a little bit like keeping a diary that described how my feelings had grown.\\" In the September 1981 Cartoonist Profiles magazine she said: \\"I drew a round blob of a girl who was supposed to be me, the one who was feeling all these fantastic things. Then I added a blob of a boy who was the reason I was feeling these things.\\" Syndication and success uprightthumb Fourth edition print of one of the many LOVE IS.... books written and drawn by Kim Grove, published by Signette. The frontispiece carries the message “FOR MY MOTHER”. Casali's obituary published in The Times related that after she and Roberto became engaged, Casali took a job as a receptionist for a design company, \\"and made up little booklets of her winsome cartoons, which she sold for a dollar apiece. Word soon spread and the demand for Love is... escalated. Roberto recognised their commercial potential and showed them to an American journalist.\\" Although other sources differ regarding whether it was Roberto or Casali herself who first showed the cartoons to an acquaintance working for the Los Angeles Times, the newspaper picked them up for publication and published the first of the series on 5 January 1970, under the pen name \\"Kim\\". The cartoon's release coincided with the wave of success of the novel Love Story (1970) by Erich Segal, and the subsequent movie of the same name starring Ali MacGraw as a girl dying of an incurable disease and Ryan O'Neal as the student who worshiped her. The film's slogan was \\"Love means never having to say you're sorry.\\" Casali altered it into one of her most famous cartoons: \\"Love is... being able to say you're sorry.\\" While the cartoons proved to be very popular and were soon syndicated in the United States and overseas, being published in newspapers in fifty countries world-wide, Roberto's company had closed down and the couple \\"found themselves living in the US illegally, 'trying to find jobs that would keep us one step ahead of the Immigration Department'\\". By 1971 they had travelled to New Zealand, where they were married on 24 July 1971 at St. Andrew's Church, Epsom, Auckland – the same church in which her parents were married in 1936. Casali wore a crown of daisies and a shoulder-length veil that she had previously drawn on 'her' character in the cartoon. Casali said of the marriage: \\"My father had died when I was young, so when Roberto asked me to get married I agreed, but said, 'Whatever you do, don't die on me.' He laughed and promised to stick around.\\" In January 1972, with Love is... by now a successful and lucrative product licensed for reproduction on mugs, T-shirts, calendars, posters and greetings cards, they moved to Weybridge, England, and bought a second home in Los Angeles. At the height of their popularity in the 1970s, the cartoons were earning Casali £4–5 million annually. Bereavement and 'miracle' baby By 1974 the couple had two sons, Stefano and Dario, and planned to have two more children. In 1975 Roberto was diagnosed with testicular cancer and doctors described his condition as \\"extremely grave.\\" Casali said: \\"I spent the next year fighting for a cure and trying to keep the bad news from him.\\" Casali commissioned London-based English cartoonist Bill Asprey to take over the writing and drawing of the daily cartoons for her, under her signature. Asprey has produced the cartoon continuously since 1975. Roberto opted for surgery at the end of 1975 in order to prolong his life. Casali said: \\"We were talking about Christmas presents and I told Roberto I didn't want another diamond ring, I wanted another baby.\\" They decided \\"...that we would store some sperm just in case I didn't get pregnant before Roberto died. I knew he had only a few months to live, so we stored some sperm immediately.\\" Roberto died in March 1976, aged 31. Despite initial opposition from the medical profession she underwent several treatments of artificial insemination at a Cambridge clinic, and gave birth to son Milo Roberto Andrea sixteen months later, on 10 July 1977. She said at the time: \\"Roberto and I were very anxious to provide a brother or sister to our two sons. Now, thanks to the care and patience of the doctors, it has been made possible for me to have another reminder of my wonderful husband.\\" British newspapers called Milo the \\"miracle baby\\". The birth announcement consisted of a simple card drawn by Casali with the Love is... girl pushing a pram on the front, with the inscription inside: \\"Proudly presenting Milo Roberto. Parents: Kim and the late Roberto (posthumously by artificial insemination)\\". Responding to criticism of her choice to go through with the procedure, Casali said: \\"Milo is here because of the love of his mother and father. If that is judged wrong, the world has lost its sense of proportion. We tried to have a baby by artificial insemination before Roberto died. If we had been successful, Milo would have been conceived during matrimony. What difference does it make that the conception occurred after Roberto's death?\\" The press focused on Milo for much of his early life, reporting on 'milestones' such as his first birthday and first day at school. After his mother's death, Milo revealed: \\"Mum collected all the newspaper articles I appeared in.\\" Later life In the mid-1980s Casali moved the family to New South Wales, Australia, and bought a farm north of Sydney where she bred Arabian horses for several years. In 1990 she returned to England and settled in Leatherhead, Surrey. In 1996 Diane Blood, a widow, sought impregnation with her husband's sperm, and Casali gave a rare interview in which she \\"deplored the courts' involvement in Mrs Blood's case: such matters, she said, should be dealt with privately.\\" Casali died due to cancer of the bone and liver in 1997.

Schematic representation a single carbon nanohorn. Carbon nanohorn aggregate Single-walled carbon nanohorn (SWNH or SWCNH) is the name given by Sumio Iijima and colleagues in 1999 to horn-shaped sheath aggregate of graphene sheets. Very similar structures had been observed in 1994 by Peter J.F. Harris, Edman Tsang, John Claridge and Malcolm Green. Ever since the discovery of the fullerene, the family of carbon nanostructures has been steadily expanded. Included in this family are single-walled and multi- walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs and MWNTs), carbon onions and cones and, most recently, SWNHs. These SWNHs with about 40–50 nm in tubule length and about 2–3 nm in diameter are derived from SWNTs and ended by a five-pentagon conical cap with a cone opening angle of ~20o. Moreover, thousands of SWNHs associate with each other to form the ‘dahlia-like' and ‘bud-like’ structured aggregates which have an average diameter of about 80–100 nm. The former consists of tubules and graphene sheets protruding from its surface like petals of a dahlia, while the latter is composed of tubules developing inside the particle itself. Their unique structures with high surface area and microporosity make SWNHs become a promising material for gas adsorption, biosensing, drug delivery, gas storage and catalyst support for fuel cell. Single-walled carbon nanohorns are an example of the family of carbon nanocones. Synthesis SWNHs can be synthesized with high purity by CO2 laser ablation and arc discharge without a metal catalyst. The following two subsections respectively show the representative procedures for the two synthesis methods. The size and purity of the SWNHs can be changed by varying the parameters such as temperature, pressure, voltage and current. =CO2 laser ablation= CO2 laser ablation technique is utilized to produce the first SWNHs at room temperature in absence of a metal catalyst. The CO2 laser ablation generator is composed of a high-power CO2 laser source (with a wavelength of 10.6 μm, 5 kW of power, 10 nm of beam diameter, and the pulse width varies from 10 ms to continuous illumination) and a plastic-resin reaction chamber attached with a vacuum pumping system, inlet and outlet gas valves and a ZnSe lens system to adjust beam intensity. Ar gas is introduced and flowed through the inside chamber to remove the products to the collection filter under the pressure of 760 Torr at room temperature. Meanwhile, a graphite rod in the middle of the chamber continuously rotates and advances along its axis so that a new surface could be exposed to the laser beam that is vertical to the rod and thus SWNHs are produced. =Arc discharge= SWNHs can also be prepared by a simple pulsed arc discharge between pure carbon rods in the atmospheric pressure of air and He and Ar with arcing period of 30s. The arc current is set at 120 A and voltage between the electrodes is 15 V. Pre-heating of the carbon rod up to 1000 ℃, is conducted just before ignition of arc to improve the quality of SWNHs. The arc soot deposited on the surface of the chamber is collected and characterized. By this method, the purity of obtained SWNHs is higher than 90%. The mean size of SWNH particles is about 50 nm, which is smaller than those prepared by the CO2 laser method. Properties =Porosity= Soon after the discovery of the SWNHs, the scientists made efforts to study the structure of this new material. In 2000, a detailed X-ray diffraction examination showed that the interhorn-wall distance was 0.4 nm, greater than the interlayer spacing of graphite (0.335 nm). Thus SWNH aggregates should have both microporosity and mesoporosity originating from the above specific structure. An exact surface characterization of SWNHs can extend the application possibilities to secondary energy storage. The pore structure of SWNHs has been extensively studied using simulation and adsorption experiments. The SWNH aggregates have a considerable capacity of micropores and a little mesoporosity due to the hexagonal stacking structure of the SWNHs. In 2001, N2 adsorption was observed in the internal nanospace and on the external surface of the single SWNH particle, studied by grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation and was compared with the experimental results. The detailed comparison of the simulated adsorption isotherm with the experimental isotherm in the internal nanospaces provided 2.9 nm of the average pore width of the internal nanospaces. The high-resolution N2 adsorption analysis could clearly elucidate the presence of internal nanopores, external micropores of the triangular arrangement of three particles, and interparticle mesopores in the assembly structure for partially oxidized SWNHs. In 2002, it was found that nanoscale windows were produced on the wall when the SWNHs were oxidized in oxygen at high temperature,. The size and concentration of these nanoscale windows could be controlled by the oxidation temperature. Besides, the oxidation and compression of SWNHs could induce a pronounced increase in the microporosity and the production of mesopores. Although the intraparticle pore of the original SWNHs is completely closed, 11 and 36% of the intraparticle pore spaces become open by oxidation at 573 and 623 K, respectively. As the number and size of the windows in the wall of SWNH can be varied by the heating temperature, the possibility for a molecular selective adsorbent is shown. In addition, adsorption analysis can provide a reliable means for evaluation of the pore structure parameters of the interstitial and internal microporosity. The adsorption study showed that the budlike SWNH aggregates possess micropores despite the closed individual nanohorns. A distinctive feature of these micropores is the small average pore width of 1.0 nm. Heat treatment in oxygen opens the closed nanohorns and thus increases the micropore space available for adsorption. The oxidation affects mostly the closed pores by creating windows on the walls and does not change the bundle structure as well as the interstitial microporosity. Opening mechanism of internal nanoporosity of single-wall carbon nanohorn was revealed through careful oxidation, which allowed controlling the internal nanoporosity. The opening rate was also controllable by oxidation temperature. At the same year (2002) as the discovery of nanoscale windows, adsorption isotherms of hydrogen in internal and interstitialspaces of SWNH assemblies were also determined experimentally, which provided the adsorbed density of hydrogen in internal and interstitial spaces. The fact that the adsorbed density of hydrogen in interstitial spaces is lower than that in internal spaces against the prediction from the interaction potential calculation was explained by the self-stabilization effect of the self-locking mechanism. In 2005, Kaneko et al. declared that the porosity of SWNH assemblies changed after treatment with HNO3. In this case,SWNH assemblies probably possess unavailable interstitial pores at the core of the bundle for adsorption. The intercalation of HNO3 into such narrow interstitial spaces resulted in an increase of the pore volume, which developed the microporosity, thus highly ultramicroporous SWNH assemblies were successfully prepared. Moreover, the ultramicroporous SWNH assemblies showed much higher storage capacity of supercritical CH4, showing potential application as a gas storage media. The detailed structure of SWNHs was further extensively analyzed with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy. The considerably strong peak due to single bonding carbons was observed in C1s XPS spectrum of SWNH. This peak intensity increased with oxidation treatment, coinciding with the decrease in Raman G/D intensity ratio. It was concluded that the presence of a considerable amount of single bonding carbons was the reason for the unique assembly structure accompanying with a strong D-band in Raman spectrum of SWNHs. The inside structure of SWNHs was examined by electron microscopy observations after focused ion beam (FIB) cutting. It was revealed that the interior consists of disordered single-layered graphene sheets with a lateral size of up to 10 nm and an interlayer distance of approximately 4–5 Å. =Electronic properties= The electronic properties are greatly influenced by the unique conical structure of SWNHs. Most of the studies on the electronic properties investigated the conical endcaps that contain five pentagons in the hexagonal network. Berber et al. utilized theoretical calculations to determine the stability, optimum geometry, and electronic properties of SWNHs and found a net electron transfer to the pentagonal sites of the SWNH tips by simulated scanning tunneling microscopy(STM). The local density of electronic states at the tip varies corresponding to the shapes of the SWNHs that differ in the relative locations of the five pentagons. Pursuing this further, Kolesnikov et al. proposed a hyperboloid geometry that has a cone asymptotic at large distance and a smoothing at the tip for SWNHs. They investigated the influence of the pentagonal defects on the electronic properties of the SWNHs within the continuum gauge field-theory model. They found that only for five pentagons at the tip does a normalized electron state appear at the Fermi level(a hypothetical level of potential energy for an electron inside a crystalline solid) for an unbounded hyperboloid. The electronic properties of dahlia-SWNHs and oxidized SWNHs were also studied by adsorption of gas such as CO2(an electron donor) and O2 (an electron acceptor). The increased electronic conductivity with adsorption of CO2 indicates that dahlia-SWNHs are n-type semiconductors. On the other hand, the electronic conductivity increases after an initial drop for the oxidized SWNHs, implying that SWNHs can be transformed into p-type semiconductors after oxidation treatment. The initial drop is due to transfer of electrons from CO2 to ox-SWNH annihilates holes, reducing the conductivity, while the later increase is because of the further electron transfer from CO2 after compensation of the hole carriers. As expected, the addition of CO2 results in a decreasing electronic conductivity of the SWNHs. =Magnetic properties= The magnetic properties are closely interrelated to the electronic properties in SWNHs. In one electronic spin resonance (ESR) work, two electronic systems were discovered for dahlia-like SWNHs. The first one has a unique temperature-activated paramagnetic susceptibility due to the two-dimensional (2D) graphene-like structure at the surface of the dahlia particles. The second type is due to the disordered graphiticlike interior of the dahlia particles that consist of crushed nanohorns and touching graphene sheets. In this type, the susceptibility is increasing with decreasing temperature until 17 K. This susceptibility is composed of Curie (localized spins) and significant Pauli (conduction electrons, temperature independent) components. Here, the number of localized spins (1.2×10−4 per C atom) is larger than that of multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) by one magnitude, while the Pauli susceptibility is comparable to that of MWNTs. On the other hand, a large suppression of the paramagnetic susceptibility is observed below 17 K. This phenomenon implies an antiferromagnetic correlation between the localized electrons, in which the localized spins pair into antiferromagnetic singlet pairs. However, the concentration of the localized electrons is too low. To explain this, Garaj et al. suggested that the singlet coupling was mediated by conducting electrons. Additionally, a typical SWNH consisting of ~10000 carbon atoms with about 40 nm of length and 2 nm of diameter has at least one unpaired electron spin that may derivate from the electronic structure of the nanohorn tips. The spin susceptibility for SWNHs is one order of magnitude smaller than that of randomly oriented graphite, but is close to that of C60 and C70. Normally, a large diamagnetism is expected for the sp2 bonded carbon materials due to the existence of π-electron orbital magnetism. It is suggested that the unusual small diamagnetic susceptibility observed for SWNHs is due to the cancellation of expected large diamagnetism by Van Vleck paramagnetism.  Functionalization  Various methods have been developed to functionalize carbon nanohorns including covalent bonding, π-π stacking, supramolecular assembly and decoration of metal nanoparticles. Tetracationic water-soluble porphyrin (H2P4+) could be immobilized by π-π stacking interactions onto the skeleton of SWNHs. The efficient fluorescence quenching of the H2P4+ moiety in the SWNH-H2P4+ nanoensemble was probed by steady-state as well as time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy, suggesting charge separation from the photoexcited H2P4+ to SWNH. Similarly, organic π-electron donor, tetrathiafulvalene (TTF-) could be assembled onto SWNHs through coulombic attraction to form a water-soluble nanohybrid with positively charged pyrene (pyr+) as a medium. Electronic interactions within the nanoensemble were probed by optical spectroscopy, indicating electron transfer between the TTF units and CNHs after light illumination. SWNHs can also be oxidized to generate functional groups for further bio-modification. Light- assisted oxidation with hydrogen peroxide effectively and rapidly creates abundant oxygenated groups such as carboxylic groups at the hole edges. These oxygenated groups could react with the protein bovine serum albumin to form bio-conjugates which were highly dispersed in phosphate-buffered saline and could be taken up by cultured mammalian cells via an endocytosis pathway. In another report, functionalization of carbon nanohorns was achieved using two different synthetic protocols: (1) direct attack of a free amino group on the nanohorn sidewalls (nucleophilic addition) and (2) amidation reaction of the carboxylic functions in oxidized nanohorns. The electronic properties of the porphyrin/nanohorn assemblies (SWNH/H2P) have been investigated by a combination of several techniques to show the electron-transfer process between the porphyrins and the carbon nanostructures. Furthermore, zinc phthalocyanine could be non-covalently attached to oxidized SWNHs through by π-π interactions to form ZnPc-SWNHox, which was then functionalized with BSA covalently to form by ZnPc-SWNHox-BSA nanoensembles. Upon photoexcitation, charge separation takes place from the excited singlet state of ZnPc to SWNHox. This findings may broaden the range of utilization of SWNHox in photochemistry, as well as photobiology. Zinc porphyrin could also bind to oxidized SWNHs through covalent bonding with a spacer and a crown ether. This nanohybrid showed similar photoinduced electron-transfer processes. In addition, SWNHs can be functionalized using noble metal nanoparticles. Pd- tailored SWNHs were prepared by reducing H2PdCl4 to SWNHs to catalyze a water formation reaction. SWNHs could also be decorated by gold nanoparticles via a block polyelectrolyte to form water-soluble nanohybrid colloids. This new material is bio-compatible and has potential applications in bio-medical researches. Recently, liposomes were assembled onto SWNHs through electrostatic attraction to form a soluble and bio-compatible nanohybrid. Assembling lipids around carbon nanohorns would confer this nanomaterial much broader applications such as vaccine development and targeted drug delivery by embedding a target protein or immunogenic protein into the lipid bilayer structure.  Applications  Carbon nanohorn is a promising material for chemical and bio-sensors because it facilitates electron transfer. Functionalized carbon nanohorns show better dispersity and when bio- conjugated, they can serve biomedical applications such as probing, imaging and drug delivering. Also, carbon nanohorns possess strong catalytic property, which can be applied to fuel cell fabrication. Due to their tremendous porosity, they are great materials for gas storage. Besides, as they have high current capacity and stability, they have applications in field emission. = Sensor materials = A gas sensor composed of SWNHs could be fabricated with an electrokinetic method using dielectrophoresis (DEP). Conductance of the DEP-fabricated SWNH sensor increased or decreased upon exposure to ppm-levels of NO2 or NH3, respectively, similar to the previously obtained CNT gas sensors which suggests that the SWNH aggregate behaves as a p-type semiconductor. The comparison reveals that intrinsic NO2 sensitivity of the SWNHs is lower than that of single-wall CNTs but comparable with the intrinsic sensitivity of multiple-wall CNTs (MWCNTs). Another gas sensor using coating film of SWHNs aimed to detect ozone in water. This sensor is based on the phenomena that the electric resistance of the SWNHs-film decreased with the adsorption of ozone molecules due to charge transfer from the surface of SWNHs to O3 molecules. The shift of the electric resistance of the SWNH-film was correlated with the ozone concentration and temperature based on monolayer adsorption model with consideration of activation energies of the relevant adsorption, desorption, and sensitivity of charge transfer. SWNHs could also be used to prepare a hydrogen peroxide amperometric sensor using a carbon paste electrode. SWNHs paste electrode is an interesting alternative to high surface area platinum electrode for determination of hydrogen peroxide, demonstrating a metal-free and user-friendly electrochemical sensing method. Another hydrogen peroxide biosensor was fabricated using soybean peroxidase decorated SWNHs modified electrode based on the realization of direct electrochemistry of enzyme. In the absence of a mediator, this H2O2 biosensor exhibited a high sensitivity and a wide linear range. Applying similar principles, the SWNHs-modified glass carbon electrode displayed excellent electrochemical catalytic activities and could be used to simultaneously determine uric acid, dopamine, and ascorbic acid in urine samples. Special designed SWNHs nanocomposites have versatile biosensing applications. One example is the sandwich nanohybrid of SWNHs–TiO2–porphyrin, prepared via the dentate binding of TiO2 nanoparticles to carboxylate groups. The nanohybrid showed an excellent electrocatalytic activity towards the reduction of chloramphenicol in neutral media, leading to a highly sensitive and stable amperometric biosensor for chloramphenicol. Another example is the specific peptide functionalized SWNHs nanocomposite, which was used to fabricate an immunosensor towards microcystin-LR. Compared to other nanomaterials, SWNHs increased the sensitivity of immunoassay. = Nanocomposites = Reinforcing a nanocomposite with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) improves its mechanical properties including modulus, tensile strength, and failure strength. It has also been reported that adding CNT to polyacrylonitrile (PAN)/CNT fiber composites decreases the fibrillation tendency of these fibers. Considering the superior properties of CNHs over CNTs, such as larger surface area, it is expected that CNH-reinforced nanocomposites show even higher performance compared to CNT- reinforced nanocomposites. However, higher surface of CNHs compared to the CNTs results in the higher tendency of these structures for agglomeration which impedes the wide application of CNHs as a reinforcement for nanocomposites. Agglomerates act as stress concentration sites which reduce the overall strength of nanocomposites. Furthermore, there are some reports on the adverse effect of presence of agglomerates on the physicochemical properties of nanocomposites. Mechanical properties of CNH-reinforced nanocomposites are studied both experimentally and using theoretical calculations. During the experimental studies, ranges of experimental processing variables (PAN- based solution concentration, amount of nanohorns in suspension, ultrasounds frequency and power, sonication time) have been studied. It is shown that increasing sonication time is in favor of reducing the agglomerate size, while increasing the polymer has an adverse effect. Furthermore, adding surfactant enhances the dispersion of the agglomerates. The processing method used for making the nanocomposite affects distribution of CNH agglomerates which consequently affects the mechanical properties of the manufactured nanocomposite. For example, the tensile strength of a poorly made nanocomposite falls 30% to 35% compared to the pure polymer matrix. Effect of concentration of CNHs has also studied which shows that while increase in the concentration of CNHs does not affect the elastic modulus of the material, it changes the failure strain of the nanocomposite. Theoretical studies show that the variation of stress along the CNHs is a function of their geometrical properties such as cone angle. For example, location of maximum axial normal stress becomes closer to the tip of CNH as the cone angle increases (Figure on the right). Furthermore, it has been shown that the variation of shear stress in the CNH/matrix surface is non-symmetric which is in contrast to symmetric distribution of shear stress in the CNT/matrix interface. Schematic representation axial normal stress in a carbon nanohorn embedded in a nanocomposite under axial loading. = Biomedical engineering = Attributed to its distinctive dahlia-flowerlike structure and already desirable size (usually <100 nm), SWNHs are a potential vehicle for intracellular delivery. They could be successfully isolated by a copolymer (Gum Arabic) through steric stabilization. and in vitro study showed that the modified SWNHs are nontoxic and might be used as a promising vehicle for intracellular delivery. The toxicity of SWNHs is a critical issue relating to their biomedical application, which has been investigated in vitro and in vivo extensively. The SWNHs were found to be a nonirritant and a nondermal sensitizer through skin primary and conjunctival irritation tests and skin sensitization test. Negative mutagenic and clastogenic potentials suggest that SWNHs are not carcinogenic. The acute peroral toxicity of SWNHs was found to be quite low—the lethal dosage for rats was more than 2000 mg/kg of body weight. Intratracheal instillation tests revealed that SWNHs rarely damaged rat lung tissue for a 90-day test period, although black pigmentation due to accumulated nanohorns was observed. While further toxicological assessments, including chronic (repeated dose), reproductive, and developmental toxicity studies, are still needed, yet the present results strongly suggest that as- grown SWNHs have low acute toxicities. SWNHs find applications in anti-tumor drug delivery and therapy. Oxidized SWNHs could entrap cisplatin, an anticancer agent, which was slowly released from the SWNHs in aqueous environments. The released cisplatin was effective in terminating the growth of human lung-cancer cells, while the SWNHs themselves had no such effect, showing that cisplatin-incorporated oxidized SWNHs are a potential drug delivery system. Later, a new nanoprecipitation method to incorporate cisplatin inside SWHNox was reported involving dispersion of cisplatin and SWNHox in a solvent followed by the solvent evaporation. The incorporated cisplatin quantity increased from the previously reported value of 15 to 46%, and the total released quantity of cisplatin also increased from 60 to 100% by changing the solvent from dimethylformamide to water. Concurrently, in vitro anticancer efficiency of cisplatin@SWNHox increased to 4–6 times greater than that of the intact cisplatin. In vivo, cisplatin@SWNHox intratumorally injected to transplanted tumors of mice suppressed the tumor growth more than the intact cisplatin. Cisplatin@SWNHox adhered to the cell surfaces in vitro and stayed within the tumor tissues in vivo. Therefore, the cisplatin released from SWNHox realized high concentrations locally at the cells in vitro and in the tissues in vivo and could efficiently attack the tumor cells. Similarly, vancomycin hydrochloride (VCM) could be incorporated into SWNHox for controlled release by taking advantage of the interactions between VCM and SWNHox. Phospholipid–poly(ethylene glycol) was used to modify the hydrophobic surface of SWNHox to improve its dispersion in aqueous systems. In the release study using this complex, a stable release of VCM was achieved for an extended period. Polyethylene glycolcould bind to the hydrophobic surface of SWNHs to enhance their dispersibility in water for further application in drug delivery. Adsorption of polyethylene glycol-doxorubicin (PEG-DXR) conjugate onto SWNHox could form a water-soluble nanocomposite. SWNHs served as drug carriers to realize local cancel chemotherapy. When injected intratumorally, PEG-DXR SWNHs caused significant retardation of tumor growth associated with prolonged DXR retention in the tumor, showing that water-dispersed SWNHs were useful drug carriers for local chemotherapy. In drug delivery, it is essential to quantitatively determine biodistribution and ultrastructural localization. To achieve this, Gd2O3 nanoparticles were embedded within SWNH aggregates (Gd2O3@SWNHag) to facilitate detection and quantification. Gd2O3@SWNHag was intravenously injected into mice, and the quantities of Gd in the internal organs were measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy: 70–80% of the total injected material accumulated in liver. The high electron scattering ability of Gd allows detection with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and facilitates the ultrastructural localization of individual Gd2O3@SWNHag with transmission electron microscopy. In the liver, the Gd2O3@SWNHag was localized in Kupffer cells but were not observed in hepatocytes. In the Kupffer cells, most of the Gd2O3@SWNHag was detected inside phagosomes, but some were in another cytoplasmic compartment that was most likely the phagolysosome. = Fuel cell = As mentioned above, SWNHs can be decorated with Pt nanoparticles to have great catalytic activity. Pt nanoparticles with diameters less than 5 nm could be well dispersed on SWNHs and this catalytic nanohybrid was useful for the power generation by polymer electrolyte fuel cell. Another fuel cell was built by electropolymerization of methylene blue (MB) onto SWNHs modified electrode. Glucose dehydrogenase was then immobilized on the poly MB–SWNHs modified electrode for the oxidation of glucose. Employing Pt nanoparticles supported on functionalized TiO2 colloidal spheres with nanoporous surface as cathode catalyst, the as-assembled glucose/O2 biofuel cell operate at the physiological condition with good performance. = Gas storage = Hydrogen storage Hydrogen storage is a key enabling technology for the advancement of fuel cell power systems in transportation applications. Solid adsorbents which can store fuel gases such as hydrogen and methane at high density have been requested for environments protection, because hydrogen and methane vehicles have low emissions of CO2. However, it is difficult to store these gases in a highly dense state, because supercritical gases do not condense to liquid at room temperature even under high pressure. Carbon materials such as Graphite nanofibers (GNF), single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNT),and modified carbon nanotubes are hopeful hydrogen storage candidates. The gas storage mechanism includes four different concepts, that is physical adsorption, chemisorption, absorption, and occlusion. Physical adsorption is the most suitable mechanism to the application of fuel cells because it is reversible and both adsorption and desorption rates are very large, although the ordinary storage capacity by physical adsorption is limited because of weak hydrogen-hydrogen and hydrogen- carbon interactions. Although chemisorption is realized to have the high adsorption capacity, it is not reversible. On the other hand, absorption and occlusion are usually difficult in carbon materials because the carbon structure is rigid. SWNH is a new material that is similar to SWNT. Due to its high purity (>95%) without any metal catalyst, SWNH has been thought to be an ideal candidate for hydrogen storage study, without any possible effect by metallic particles as catalyst on hydrogen storage capacity. Murata et al.'s study determined the exact physical adsorption amounts of supercritical hydrogen on the single-wall carbon nanohorn (SWNH) assemblies were at 77, 196, and 303 K. There are two physical adsorption sites of SWNH, that are interstitial and internal sites. Although the interaction potential depths of interstitial and internal spaces different, hydrogen densities in both spaces were similar. Hydrogen molecules adsorbed in the interstitial spaces cannot form the stable cluster owing to the space limitation, however, hydrongen can be stabilized by the strong fluid-fluid interaction due to the cluster formation in the internal spaces. Methane storage Noriaki Sano et al. synthesized single-walled carbon nanohorns (SWNHs) via a gas-injected arc-in- water method. The electrode configuration and duration of arc discharge were modified in order to enhance the yield and methane-adsorption properties of SWNHs. Using these modified experimental parameters, the horn units in the SWNH aggregates increased in size, and the thermal stability of SWNHs in an oxidative environment increased accordingly. SWNHs obtained using the above modified conditions adsorbed a larger amount of methane than did SWNHs obtained from the conventional synthetic conditions. The effect of a mild oxidation treatment on SWNHs on their methane adsorption suggested that SWNHs with micropores would be more flexible than pristine SWNHs. By comparing the methane adsorption on the oxidized SWNHs to that on the pristine SWNHs, one can see that the oxidation of the SWNHs significantly increased the amount of methane adsorbed per apparent volume of SWNH bulk. The amount of methane adsorbed per apparent volume of oxidized SWNHs was about 2 times larger than that of pristine SWNHs, and the amount of methane adsorbed per mass of oxidized SWNHs was about 1.8 times larger than that of pristine SWNHs. The difference between “2 times” and 1.8 times” suggests that oxidized SWNHs can be packed more densely by compression than the pristine SWNHs, which is due to the change in the structural flexibility of SWNHs caused by mild oxidation. = Field emission = Field emission is emission of electrons induced by an electrostatic field. Among the tasks for optimization of the field emission, the development of large scale/low price production methods is one of the key problem. Carbon nanohorns can be synthesized in large quantities, and the product, unlike nanotubes, does not need any further purification. The carbon nanohorn thin films show good field emission characteristics due to the sharp horn-like structures, in particular a low turn-on field and good long-term stability. The only marked difference with respect to nanotube films is that when current densities higher than 1 mA/cm2, permanent damage will apply to the sample, whereas nanotubes can withstand densities that are higher by at least two orders of magnitude. This again may be due to the very peculiar structure and high resistivity of nanohorns. Since their long-term stability is comparable to that of nanotubes, nanohorns could represent an enticing alternative for field emission applications that do not require high current densities.

They exhibit pore size ranging from 2 nm - 50 nm, depending on the organic substituents. In contrast, zeolites exhibit pore sizes less than a nanometer. PMOs have potential applications as catalysts, adsorbents, trapping agents, drug delivery agents, stationary phases in chromatography and chemical sensors. History  The breakthrough report int this area described the use of surfactants to produce periodic mesoporous silicas (PMS) were developed in 1992 with pores larger that of zeolites. Early mesoporous organosilicas developed had organic groups attached terminally to the silica surface. They were prepared either by grafting of organic group onto the channel walls or by template-directed co-condensation. For example, by modifying the channels of PMSs with alkanethiol groups that could sequester heavy metals. However, there were some major limitations like, inhomogeneity of the pores compared to PMSs, and limited organic content (around 25% with respect to the silicon wall sites). In 1999, reports described mesoporous organosilicas with organic groups located within the pore channel walls as \\"bridges\\" between Si centers. Since these materials had both organic and inorganic groups as integral part of the porous framework, they were considered as composites of organic and inorganic material and designated as periodic mesoporous organosilicas (PMOs). This family of porous materials had high degree of order and uniformity of pores compared to those with terminal organic groups. Some organic bridging groups used in early mesoporous organosilica Structure of PMOs The framework of PMOs consists of inorganic components (polysilsesquioxanes) uniformly bridged by organic linkers. Most of the bridged polysilsesquioxane can be generically represented by the formula O1.5Si-R-SiO1.5. where R represents the organic bridging group. Each individual organic group is covalently bonded to two or more silicon atoms in the framework.The pores in the material are periodically ordered with diameter in the range 2 -30 nm. Depending on the synthetic conditions used to make mesoporous organosilicas, the mesoscale structure can either be amorphous or crystalline. Most of the mesoporous organosilicas that have been synthesized are amorphous. Although, x-ray diffraction of these materials indicate periodicity in the structure, sharp peaks in the medium scattering angle representative of crystalline materials are usually absent, except for (00l) reflections. However, few crystalline mesoporous organosilica have been reported,. Synthesis routes of periodic mesoporous organosilicas Synthesis The primary methods used to make mesoporous organosilicas are evaporation-induced self-assembly, surfactant-mediated synthesis, post-synthetic grafting, and co-condensation. Organosilicas with amorphous structures are typically made by functionalizing organic groups rather than directly integrating the functional groups in the framework, which produces a periodic structure. Furthermore, basic hydrolytic conditions typically produce a periodic structure because of hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions between hydrolyzed precursors that then self- assemble. Evaporation-induced self-assembly usually causes random alignment of the material pores. This method of synthesis uses the difference in vapor pressure of solvents to vary the rate of evaporation and therefore the assembly of the organosilica framework. Surfactant-mediated synthesis has been widely used for the production of mesoporous materials in general, and PMOs specifically,. It involves the addition of a surfactant or copolymer to a specific molecular precursor. The surfactant directs the structure of the material by interacting with the precursor in such a way that is dependent on the properties of the precursor. After the bulk structure is assembled, the surfactant is removed, leaving pores, or channels, embedded in the material framework. The surfactant template can be removed by solvent extraction or ion-exchange mechanisms. An aging process is usually performed at high temperature before removal of the surfactant. During surfactant-mediated synthesis, hydrolysis and polycondensation, or co-condensation, are used to fuse precursor molecules in a framework. Acidic or basic conditions are used for the hydrolysis depending on the precursor being introduced. The other two synthesis methods used for these materials are post-synthetic grafting and co- condensation. In the case of post-synthetic grafting, organic functional groups, typically organosilanes or alkoxyorganosilanes, are reacted with the assembled silicon mesostructure with or without the surfactant template present.Laghaei, Milad, et al. \\"The effect of various types of post-synthetic modifications on the structure and properties of MCM-41 mesoporous silica.\\" Progress in Organic Coatings 90 (2016): 163-170. If the template is still present, the grafting process will involve simultaneously removing the template and attaching the functional group. However, the pores of the material can be blocked during this process so a one-pot synthesis using the necessary components is more advantageous. This one-pot synthesis is known as co-condensation, in which the desired organosilyl functional groups are combined with the surfactant or other structure-directing agent. In this method, the material becomes structured and functionalized. Co-condensation gives rise to periodicity with the mesostructure, and it accommodates larger organic groups as well as larger pore sizes because of the one-step assembly process. Most PMOs have been made using the co-condensation method. The most recent method developed builds on co-condensation by combining multiple reactive organic precursors to form a new functional group, which is still combined with the framework molecule and copolymer. Mesoporous organosilicate materials have been made using bridged organic precursors, in which an organic fragment is positioned between silicon-containing fragments. Single precursor syntheses are typically done with bridged organosilane groups. When only one bridged organic precursor is used, there is a homogeneous distribution of the molecule in the framework. This phenomenon is referred to as molecular-scale periodicity. Chiral precursors can also be introduced into the material framework, and using acidic conditions in the hydrolysis and condensation process proves better for chiral precursors because no racemization occurs. Co-condensation of multiple organosilane precursors can create multi- functional organosilica materials. Tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) is a common silicon precursor used in co-condensation reactions. Applications Highly porous compounds are potential catalysts, adsorption, and separation. These have been the roles of zeolites, but their small pore size limits them to work with small molecules. The larger pore size (2-50 nm) of mesoporous materials gives them wider application – larger molecules can be admitted, and guest molecules can migrate faster. =Catalysis= To effect catalytic transformations using mesoporous organosilicas, it is necessary to functionalize them. The two major methods are to add a group or heteroatom, such as a metal center, to the organic framework, and to anchor an organic or organometallic group to the pore surface. The two methods for anchoring functional groups to organosilica frameworks Anchoring a homogeneous catalyst onto a mesoporous organosilicas framework has two primary disadvantages: the bulky group in the pore can block travel of guest molecules through it, and preparation of candidate molecules for anchoring to the framework is difficult. However, anchoring can create heterogeneous catalysts for a wide variety of chemical transformations: acid catalysis, base catalysis, coupling and condensation reaction catalysis, and even asymmetric catalysis. Anchored functional groups often have higher catalytic activity than does the bulk material, as one study showed for Nafion, or even than groups incorporated into the organosilica framework, as with sulfonic acid. =Other potential uses= Use of PMOs for adsorption of pollutant species Mesoporous organosilicas can be functionalized give sorbants, for removal specific contaminants from air and water. Candidate adsorbants include toxic heavy metals, radioactive material, and various organic pollutants have been synthesized. Mesoporous organosilicas have been functionalized with fluorescent probes. The advantage of this material as a sensor is its high surface area combined with the high specificity achievable by careful functionalization. Mesoporous organosilicas have been used to sense a wide variety of analytes: metals, industrial pollutants, small organic molecules, and large biological molecules. Mesoporous organosilicas have been tested as potential materials for separation using HPLC. Froba et al. have shown that by using benzene PMO microspheres as stationary phases better separation can be achieved in the HPLC system. The theory was that the π-π interaction between the aromatic analytes and the phenylene bridge of the PMO framework leads to stronger retention and hence better separation. Controlled drug release is another aspect in which PMOs have been shown promise. The hydrophobic nature of the PMO walls allow for better control in drug release. In this respect, it is not just the mesoporosity of the PMOs make them advantageous, the tunability of the organic groups also play an important role. Future directions It has been proposed that the periodicity of PMOs may produce anisotropic mechanical, electrical and optical responses, in the same manner that periodicity magnifies anisotropy in the unit cell of conventional crystals. Also, studies that have shown that dendrimers, polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes, and carbon nanomaterials like C60 can be incorporated into the pore walls of PMOs offers new directions in the possible applications of these materials. It has been shown that PMOs are more suitable for the construction of organic donor–acceptor systems for photocatalysis than periodic mesoporous silica because organic donor or acceptor groups within the framework provide larger empty spaces for mass transfer in photocatalysis than in mesoporous silicas. Recent investigations on charge transfer systems based on PMOs are suggestive of possible applications of PMOs in areas as such as heterojunction solar cells, photodetectors and light emitting diodes. More exciting applications can emerge by combining these materials with biological molecules such as lipids and proteins.

History Catholic priests had visited the area that is now San Angelo as early as the 17th century. Catholicism did not organize here until after Fort Concho was established in 1867. The Rev. Mathurin J. Pairier started visiting the area in 1874. He served the religious needs of Catholics at Fort Concho, Ben Ficklin, and Santa Angela. Bart J. DeWitt donated the land on which the cathedral now stands, known as \\"The Catholic Block,\\" on September 22, 1874. Plans for a church were begun after the county seat was moved to San Angelo in 1882. The church, named Immaculate Conception, was completed two years later and Pairier was named the parish's first resident pastor. The stone church housed a diverse parish community of Mexican, English, Irish, and German Catholics. The parish's second pastor, the Rev. John Sheehan, invited the Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word from San Antonio to start a parochial school. They did so in 1888. Part of the parish block was sold in 1906 during the pastorate of the Rev. Joseph Hoban when a new church building was under construction. It was this church that was named Sacred Heart. The Diocese of San Angelo was established by Pope John XXIII in 1961. Sacred Heart was named the Cathedral Church at that time. It is the mother church for many Catholic parishes in West Texas.

Core–shell semiconducting nanocrystals (CSSNCs) are a class of materials which have properties intermediate between those of small, individual molecules and those of bulk, crystalline semiconductors. They are unique because of their easily modular properties, which are a result of their size. These nanocrystals are composed of a quantum dot semiconducting core material and a shell of a distinct semiconducting material. The core and the shell are typically composed of type II–VI, IV–VI, and III–V semiconductors, with configurations such as CdS/ZnS, CdSe/ZnS, CdSe/CdS, and InAs/CdSe (typical notation is: core/shell) Organically passivated quantum dots have low fluorescence quantum yield due to surface related trap states. CSSNCs address this problem because the shell increases quantum yield by passivating the surface trap states. In addition, the shell provides protection against environmental changes, photo-oxidative degradation, and provides another route for modularity. Precise control of the size, shape, and composition of both the core and the shell enable the emission wavelength to be tuned over a wider range of wavelengths than with either individual semiconductor. These materials have found applications in biological systems and optics. Background Colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals, which are also called quantum dots (QDs), consist of ~1–10 nm diameter semiconductor nanoparticles that have organic ligands bound to their surface. These nanomaterials have found applications in nanoscale photonic, photovoltaic, and light-emitting diode (LED) devices due to their size-dependent optical and electronic properties. Quantum dots are popular alternatives to organic dyes as fluorescent labels for biological imaging and sensing due to their small size, tuneable emission, and photostability. The luminescent properties of quantum dots arise from exciton decay (recombination of electron hole pairs) which can proceed through a radiative or nonradiative pathway. The radiative pathway involves electrons relaxing from the conduction band to the valence band by emitting photons with wavelengths corresponding to the semiconductor's bandgap. Nonradiative recombination can occur through energy release via phonon emission or Auger recombination. In this size regime, quantum confinement effects lead to a size dependent increasing bandgap with observable, quantized energy levels. The quantized energy levels observed in quantum dots lead to electronic structures that are intermediate between single molecules which have a single HOMO-LUMO gap and bulk semiconductors which have continuous energy levels within bandsMurphy, C.J. Coffer, J.L. Quantum Dots: A Primer. Appl. Spectrosc. 2002, 56, 16A-27A. The electronic structure of quantum dots is intermediate between single molecules and bulk semiconductors. Semiconductor nanocrystals generally adopt the same crystal structure as their extended solids. At the surface of the crystal, the periodicity abruptly stops, resulting in surface atoms having a lower coordination number than the interior atoms. This incomplete bonding (relative to the interior crystal structure) results in atomic orbitals that point away from the surface called \\"dangling orbitals\\" or unpassivated orbitals. Surface dangling orbitals are localized and carry a slight negative or positive charge. Weak interaction among the inhomogeneous charged energy states on the surface has been hypothesized to form a band structure. If the energy of the dangling orbital band is within the semiconductor bandgap, electrons and holes can be trapped at the crystal surface. For example, in CdSe quantum dots, Cd dangling orbitals act as electron traps while Se dangling orbitals act as hole traps. Also, surface defects in the crystal structure can act as charge carrier traps. Charge carrier trapping on QDs increases the probability of non-radiative recombination, which reduces the fluorescence quantum yield. Surface-bound organic ligands are typically used to coordinate to surface atoms having reduced coordination number in order to passivate the surface traps. For example, tri-n-octylphosphine oxide (TOPO) and trioctylphospine (TOP) have been used to control the growth conditions and passivate the surface traps of high quality CdSe quantum dots. Although this method provides narrow size distributions and good crystallinity, the quantum yields are ~5–15%. Alkylamines have been incorporated into the TOP/TOPO synthetic method to increase the quantum yields to ~50%. The main challenge in using organic ligands for quantum dot surface trap passivation is the difficulty in simultaneously passivating both anionic and cationic surface traps. Steric hindrance between bulky organic ligands results in incomplete surface coverage and unpassivated dangling orbitals. Growing epitaxial inorganic semiconductor shells over quantum dots inhibits photo-oxidation and enables passivation of both anionic and cationic surface trap states. As photogenerated charge carriers are less likely to be trapped, the probability for excitons to decay through the radiative pathway increases. CdSe/CdS and ZnSe/CdSe nanocrystals have been synthesized that exhibit 85% and 80–90% quantum yield, respectively. Core–shell semiconductor nanocrystal architecture was initially investigated in the 1980s, followed by a surge of publications on synthetic methods the 1990s. Classification of core–shell semiconductor nanocrystals Core–shell semiconductor nanocrystal properties are based on the relative conduction and valence band edge alignment of the core and the shell. In type I semiconductor heterostructures, the electron and holes tend to localize within the core. In type II heterostructures, one carrier is localized in the shell while the other is localized in the core.The three types of core–shell nanocrystals. The upper and lower edges represent the upper and lower energy edges of the core (blue) and the shell (red). Type I core shell semiconductor nanocrystal (CdSe–CdS) band-edge alignment. VB=valence band, CB=conduction band =Type I= * Description In a Type I CSSNC, the bandgap of the core is smaller than that of the shell. Both the conduction and valence band edges of the core lie within the bandgap of the shell, which confines both electrons and holes in the core. This can be seen in figure X, where the electron and hole of an exciton at the CdSe (bandgap:1.74 eV) /CdS (bandgap:2.42 eV) interface occupy energy states within the CdSe core, which corresponds to the lowest available energy separation. The emission wavelength due to radiative electron-hole recombination within the core is slightly redshifted compared to uncoated CdSe. * Examples CdSe/CdS, CdSe/ZnS, InAs/CdSe and ZnO/MgO =Reverse Type I= * Description In the reverse type I configuration, the core has a wider bandgap than the shell, and the conduction and valence band edges of the shell lie within those of the core. The lowest available exciton energy separation occurs when the charge carriers are localized in the shell. Changing the shell thickness tunes the emission wavelength. * Examples CdS/HgS, CdS/CdSe, ZnSe/CdSe and MgO/ZnO =Type II= * Description In the type II configuration, the valence and conduction band edge of the core are both lower or higher than the band edges of the shell. An example of a type II is shown in figure X, ZnTe (bandgap:2.26) /CdSe (bandgap:1.74). The lowest energy separation of the electron and the hole will occur when the hole is confined in the ZnTe core valence band and the electron is confined in the CdSe shell conduction band. The emission wavelength will be determined by the energy difference between these occupied states, as shown by the red arrow, which will be at a lower energy than either of the individual bandgaps. The emission wavelength can be significantly red shifted compared to the unpassivated core. Type II core shell semiconductor nanocrystal (ZnTe/CdSe) band-edge alignment. Red arrow shows emission energy. VB=valence band, CB=conduction band * Examples ZnTe/CdSe, CdTe/CdSe, CdS/ZnSe =Doped core-shell semiconductor nanocrystals= Doping has been shown to strongly affect the optical properties of semiconductor nanocrystals. Impurity concentrations in semiconductor nanocrystals grown using colloidal synthesis, however, are typically lower than in their bulk counterparts. There has been interest in magnetic doping of CSSNCs for applications in magnetic memory and spin-based electronics. Dual-mode optical and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has been explored by doping the shell of CdSe/ZnS with Mn, which caused the CSSNC to be paramagnetic. Synthesis In synthesizing core shell nanoparticles, scientists have studied and found several wet chemical methods, such as chemical precipitation, sol-gel, microemulsion and inverse micelle formation. Those methods have been used to grow core shell chalcogenide nanoparticles with an emphasis on better control of size, shape, and size distribution. To control the growth of nanoparticles with tunable optical properties, supporting matrices such as glasses, zeolites, polymers or fatty acids have been used. In addition, to prepare nanoparticles of sulfides, selenides and tellurides, the Langmuir–Blodgett film technique has been used successfully. In comparison to wet chemical methods, electrochemical synthesis is more desirable, such as the use of aqueous solvents rather than toxic organic solvents, formation of conformal deposits, room-temperature deposition, low cost, and precise control of composition and thickness of semiconductor coating on metal nanoparticles. However, owing to the difficulty of preparing electrically addressable arrays of nanoparticles, the use of electrochemical techniques to produce core-shell nanoparticles was difficult. Recently, Cadmium Sulfide (CdS) and Copper iodide (CuI) was electrochemically grown on a 3-D nanoelectrode array via layer-by-layer depositing of alternating layers of nanoparticles and Polyoxometalate (POM). Core–shell semiconductor nanocrystals can be grown by using colloidal chemistry methods with an appropriate control of the reaction kinetics. Using this method which results in a relatively high control of size and shape, semiconductor nanostructures could be synthesized in the form of dots, tubes, wires and other forms which show interesting optic and electronic size-dependent properties. Since the synergistic properties resulting from the intimate contact and interaction between the core and shell, CSSNCs can provide novel functions and enhanced properties which are not observed in single nanoparticles. The size of core materials and the thickness of shell can be controlled during synthesis. For example, in the synthesis of CdSe core nanocrystals, the volume of H2S gas can determine the size of core nanocrystals. As the volume of H2S increases, the size of the core decreases. Alternatively, when the reaction solution reaches the desired reaction temperature, rapid cooling can result in smaller core sizes. In addition, the thickness of shell is typically determined by the added amount of shell material during the coating process. =Characterization= An increase in either the core size or shell length results in longer emission wavelengths. The interface between the core and shell can be tailored to passivate relaxation pathways and form radiative states. The size dependence of the band gap in these nanoparticles due to the quantum confinement effect has been utilized to control the photoluminescence color from blue to red by preparing nanoparticles of varying sizes. By manipulating the size or shape of the nanoparticles, the luminescence colors and purity can be controlled. However, the quantum yield and the brightness of luminescence of the CSSNCs is ultimately limited and it cannot be controlled because of the presence of surface traps. UV-vis absorption spectra, X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) are the techniques typically used to identify and characterize CSSNCs. Applications One of the most important properties of core–shell semiconducting nanocrystals (CSSNCs) is that their cores, which are quantum dots, fluoresce, which is important in their biomedical and optical applications. The shells are highly modular, and thus the bulk properties, such as solubility and activity of the CSSNCs can be changed. =Biomedical applications = The properties desired of CSSNCs when using them for biological applications include high quantum yield, narrow fluorescence emission, broad absorption profile, stability against photobleaching, 20 second fluorescent lifetime, and high brightness. High quantum yields mean that minimal energy will need to be put into the quantum dot to induce fluorescence. A narrow fluorescence emission allows for multiple colors to be imaged at once without color overlap between different types of CSSNCs. Having a broad absorption profile allows multiple CSSNCs to be excited at the same wavelength and thus, multiple CSSNCs could be imaged simultaneously. Having a 20-second fluorescent lifetime allows for time-resolved bioimaging. The utility of CSSNCs is that they can be a complement to organic fluorophores. CSSNCs are less susceptible to photobleaching, but less is known about them compared to organic fluorophores. CSSNCs have 100–1000 times the two-photon fluorescence efficiency as organic dyes, exemplifying their value. In the cases where CSSNCs are used in biological medium, the core is a quantum dot and the shell can be an organic molecule or biological ligands, such as a DNA, that are used for biocompatibility and targeting. The shell can also be an organic molecule to which a biological molecule is later conjugated, furthering the modularity of core–shell structure. The most popular core/shell pair used is CdSe core with ZnS or CdS shell, which improves the quantum yield and protects against photobleaching compared to that of the core material alone. The size of the CSSNC is directly correlated to the color of fluorescence, so being able to control particle size is desirable. However, it is generally unknown how the shell molecules, and salt concentration, pH, and temperature of the media affect the CSSNCs’ properties and remains empirical.  In vitro cell labeling  The pathway of the cells movement can be seen by the absence of CSSNCs Because multiple colors can be imaged, CSSNCs’ ability to be used in cell labeling is of growing importance. However, it can be difficult to get CSSNCs across the cell membrane. This has been achieved via endocytosis (the most common method), direct microinjection, and electroporation, and once in the cell, they become concentrated in the nucleus and can stay there for extended periods of time. Once CSSNCs are inside cells, they remain even after cellular division and can be imaged in both mother and daughter cells. This particular technique was shown using Xenopus embryos. Another example of CSSNCs is seen in their tracking ability; when cells are gown on a 2D matrix embedded with CSSNCs, cells uptake the CSSNCs as they move, leaving a trail seen as the absence of CSSNCs. This means that the mobility of cells can be imaged, which is important since the metastatic potential of breast tissue cells has been shown to increase with mobility. Also, it has been shown that five different toxins can be detected using five different CSSNCs simultaneously. In a move toward environmentally friendlier and less toxic CSSNCs, Si quantum dots with various shells have been developed. Si is 10 times safer than Cd and current work is focused on making Si more water-soluble and biocompatible. In particular, Si quantum dots with poly (acrylic acid) and allylamine shells have been used in cell labeling. Other in vitro uses include flow cyclometry, pathogen detection, and genomic and proteomic detection.  In vivo and deep tissue imaging  Because CSSNCs emit in the near-infrared region (700–900 nm) of the electromagnetic spectrum, imaging them is not complicated by autofluorescence of tissue, which occurs at higher frequencies (400–600 nm), and scattering effects. This has been used in the mapping of sentinel lymph-nodes in cancer surgery in animals. Lymph nodes 1 cm deep were imaged and the excised nodes with CSSNC accumulation were found to have the highest probability for containing metastatic cells. In addition, CSSNCs have been shown to remain fluorescent in cells in vivo for 4 months. To track and diagnose cancer cells, labeled squamous carminoma cell-line U14 cells were used and fluorescent images could be seen after 6h. CSSNCs conjugated to doxorubicin were also used to target, image, and sense prostate cancer cells that express the prostate-specific membrane antigen protein. Using a cancer-specific antibody conjugated to QDs with polymer shells is the most popular in tumor targeted imaging. The main disadvantage of using CSSNCs for in vivo imaging is the lack of information about their excretion and toxicity. The typical cores used show DNA damage and toxicity toward liver cells, but using shells seems to diminish this effect. The use of other substances in the core, such as rare-earth elements and Si, are being explored to reduce toxicity. Other disadvantages include limited commercial availability, variability in surface chemistry, nonspecific binding, and instrument limitation. =Optics= The size, shape, and composition of the core–shell structure are related to the bandgap, which in turn is related to its optical properties. Thus, by modulating the size, shape, and material of the core, the optics can be tuned and optimized for use in optical devices and applications such as LEDs, detectors, lasers, phosphors, and photovoltaics. LEDs Currently, CSSNC LED efficiency is less than that of organic LEDs. However, studies show that they have potential to accomplish what organic LEDs cannot. CSSNC LEDs constructed using multiple layers of CSSNCs resulted in poor conduction, charge imbalance, low luminescence efficiency, and a large number of pinhole defects. LEDs constructed of one monolayer avoid these problems. An advantage of CSSNC LEDs over organic LEDs is that CSSNC LEDs have narrower emissions, as narrow as 32 nm, than organic LEDs, which range from 50–100 nm. Specifically, the core–shell motif is desirable for use in LEDs because of their electroluminescence and photoluminescence quantum efficiencies and their ability to be processed into devices easily. Current aims for LED displays include developing materials with wavelength emissions of 610–620 nm for red displays, 525–530 nm for green displays, and 460–470 nm for blue displays. This is because these wavelengths maximize the perceived power and they lie outside of the National Television System Committee standard color triangle. CSSNCs have been synthesized that meet these wavelength emissions: (CdSe)ZnS for red emission, (CdS)ZnS for blue emission, and (CdxZn1−xSe)CdyZn1−yS for the green emission. Using CdSe core and ZnS or CdS/ZnS shells, the maximum luminance values of red, orange, yellow and green LEDs were improved to 9,064, 3,200, 4,470 and 3,700 cd m−2, respectively; electroluminescent efficiency (1.1–2.8 cd A−1), and turn-on voltages (3–4 V) were also increased. Lasers In CSSNCs with only one exciton, absorption and stimulated emission occur equally and in CSSNCs with more than one exciton, non-radiative Auger recombination occurs, which decays optical gain, an important quality in lasers. However, type II CSSNCs, CdS/ZnSe, were used in optical amplification from stimulated emission of single-exciton states, eliminating Auger recombination. This has the advantage that lasing threshold could be lowered under continuous wave excitation, enhancing the potential of CSSNCs as optical gain media. Type II CSSNCs separate the electrons and holes of the exciton pair, which leads to a strong electric field and thus, reducing absorption losses. Phosphors By combining the modularity of CSSNCs and stability of organic polymer, a broad range of colors of phosphors were developed. CdSe core/ZnS shell CSSNCs are used to generate bluish green to red colors, and (CdS)ZnS QDs are used to generate violet to blue colors. By mixing the appropriate amounts of the different sizes of CSSNCs, the entire visible range with narrow emission profiles and high photoluminescence quantum yields can be achieved. Dye-sensitized solar cells ZnO-TiO2 core-shell nano- structures were synthesized with fast electron transport and high surface area combining the properties of ZnO nanorods and TiO2 nano particles. As ZnO nanorods have fast electron transport and TiO2 nano-particles have high surface area. ZnO-MgO core-shell nanowires were synthesized improving the efficiency of the dye sensitized solar cells by 400% when compared to the ZnO nanowires. MgO shell acts as efficient insulating tunnel preventing recombination.

New Orleans would attempt to chase the Vancouver Grizzlies before finally landing another team in 1987. =George Shinn: Hornets move to New Orleans= In 1987, the NBA awarded an expansion team to Charlotte named the Charlotte Hornets owned by George Shinn and a few other businessmen. While the Hornets continued to put a competitive team on the court, the team's attendance fell dramatically. Many attributed this lapse in popularity to the owner George Shinn, who was slowly becoming despised by the people of the city. In 1997, a Charlotte woman claimed that Shinn had raped her, and the resulting trial severely tarnished his reputation in the city. The consensus was that while Charlotte was a basketball city, fans took out their anger at Shinn on the team. Shinn had also become discontented with the Coliseum, which had been considered state-of-the-art when it opened but had since been considered obsolete due to a limited number of luxury boxes. On March 26, 2001, both the Hornets and the Vancouver Grizzlies applied for relocation to Memphis, Tennessee, which was eventually won by the Grizzlies. Shinn then issued an ultimatum that unless the city built a new arena at no cost to him, the Hornets would leave town. The city initially refused, leading Shinn to consider moving the team to either Norfolk, Louisville, or St. Louis. Of the cities in the running, only St. Louis had an NBA-ready arena, the Savvis Center, already in place and was a larger media market than Charlotte at the time; also, it was the only one of the four to have previously had an NBA franchise -- the St. Louis Hawks, who moved to Atlanta in 1968. Finally, a new arena in Uptown, what would eventually become the Spectrum Center, was included in a non-binding referendum for a larger arts-related package, and Shinn withdrew his application to move the team. Polls showed the referendum on its way to passage. However, just days before the referendum, Mayor Pat McCrory vetoed a living wage ordinance. The veto prompted many of the city's black ministers to oppose the referendum; they felt it was immoral for the city to build a new arena when city employees were not paid enough to make a living.World Class City, Third World Paycheck . Creative Loafing, 2001-12-29 After the failed referendum, city leaders devised a plan to build a new arena in a way that did not require voter support, but made it known that they would not even consider building it unless Shinn sold the team. While even the NBA acknowledged that Shinn had alienated fans, league officials felt such a demand would anger other owners. The city council refused to remove the statement, leading the Hornets to request a move to New Orleans, returning the NBA to that city after the Jazz relocated to Salt Lake City in 1979. Although New Orleans was a smaller television market, a deal was quickly made to play at the New Orleans Arena, next door to the Louisiana Superdome. Before the Hornets were eliminated from the playoffs, the NBA approved the deal. As part of a deal, the NBA promised that Charlotte would get a new team, which became the Charlotte Bobcats two years later. In a 2008 interview with the Charlotte Observer, Shinn, who has not returned to Charlotte since the Hornets moved, admitted that the \\"bad judgment I made in my life\\" played a role in the Hornets' departure. He also said that if he had it to do all over again, he would not have withdrawn from the public after the sexual assault trial. Shinn emphasized how he was making amends by committing to New Orleans saying, \\"I've made enough mistakes in my life. I'm not going to make one here. This city needs us here. We're going to make this (New Orleans) thing work.\\"Green, Ron Jr. Shinn: I messed up in Charlotte . Charlotte Observer, 2008-11-01. New Orleans Hornets =2002–2005: Inaugural seasons= The Hornets opened their inaugural season in New Orleans on October 30, 2002, against New Orleans' original NBA franchise, the Utah Jazz. In the first regular season NBA game played in New Orleans in over 17 years,ESPN.com: Eye for victory the Hornets defeated the Jazz 100–75, and posthumously retired #7 of \\"Pistol\\" Pete Maravich during halftime. Despite nagging injuries to the teams's starting point guard, Baron Davis, the Hornets finished the season with a 47–35 record and qualified for the 2003 playoffs. They were defeated by Philadelphia four games to two in the first round. Following the season, the team fired head coach Paul Silas and replaced him with Tim Floyd. In the 2003 NBA draft, the Hornets selected David West, who would become a future All-Star with the franchise. The Hornets began the 2003–04 season strong with a 17–7 start, but sputtered at the end and finished 41–41, narrowly missing home court advantage in the first round of the 2004 playoffs. They met the Miami Heat in the first round three years after having swept them in the 2001 NBA Playoffs, but the Heat defeated the Hornets in seven games. After the season, Floyd was fired and the team hired Byron Scott as their new head coach. Due to the NBA realigning divisions for the season, the Hornets began playing in the tougher Southwest Division of the Western Conference, which had four playoff teams the previous season, and the team was not expected to compete for a playoff spot. In a season marred by injury to the team's three all-stars (Baron Davis, Jamaal Magloire, and Jamal Mashburn) an 0–8 start became a 2–29 record. As a result of the lack of success, the team's roster was reshaped, with older veterans like Baron Davis and Jamal Mashburn traded to start the rebuilding process. The team finished the year with a franchise-worst record of 18–64 and their first losing season in franchise history =2005–2007: Hurricane Katrina and temporary relocation to Oklahoma City= Chris Paul was selected by the Hornets with the 4th pick of the 2005 NBA draft. Due to the devastation brought by Hurricane Katrina upon the communities of southeastern Louisiana, the Hornets franchise temporarily relocated their operations to Oklahoma City in 2005–06 and 2006–07. During this time, the franchise was known as the New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets. In these two seasons, the vast majority of home games were played at the Ford Center in Oklahoma City, while a few remained at New Orleans Arena. Their practice facility in Oklahoma City was the Sawyer Center on the campus of Southern Nazarene University (SNU)http://snu.edu/?p={E4161849-E79C-4F0C-AD27-33DC07C3ED45}≻=-1∋=761&fr;=news 1 and the team held its 2006 training camp at their New Orleans practice facility, the Alario Center in Westwego, Louisiana. With the fourth pick in the 2005 NBA draft, the Hornets picked future all-star point guard Chris Paul. For the 2005–06 season, the team played 36 games in Oklahoma City, with one game taking place at the Lloyd Noble Center on the campus of the University of Oklahoma, three in New Orleans, and one at the Pete Maravich Assembly Center on the campus of Louisiana State University (LSU). The intent had been to play five games in all at Baton Rouge, but the restoration progress made on New Orleans Arena made the return to New Orleans a better option. They started off the 2005–06 NBA season better than expected, and the team briefly held the sixth seed in the Western playoff race. The team then lost 12 out of 13 games to drop out of playoff contention, while also setting an NBA record when they only scored 16 points in the second half of a game against the Los Angeles Clippers. The Hornets finished 38–44 and tenth place in the Western Conference. Despite the losing record, Chris Paul won the NBA Rookie of the Year Award in a landslide. The Hornets made major roster changes after the 2005–06 season in hopes of advancing to the Western Conference postseason for the first time. They traded J.R. Smith and P.J. Brown to the Chicago Bulls for Tyson Chandler, let Speedy Claxton sign with the Atlanta Hawks, but filled their backup point guard position with free agents Bobby Jackson and Jannero Pargo. They also inked Peja Stojaković from the Indiana Pacers. The Hornets opted to stay in Oklahoma City for the 2006–07 season, but promised to return to New Orleans full-time. Although the New Orleans Arena was capable of hosting the team, it was felt that the recovery efforts in New Orleans were not far along enough for the area to support a full NBA schedule. During the 2006–07 season, the Hornets played 35 home games in Oklahoma City and six in New Orleans. The team finished the regular season with a 39–43 record, one more win than the previous season, and missed the playoffs again. The team's successful operation in Oklahoma City arguably contributed to the city being named as the new home for the Seattle SuperSonics franchise starting in the 2008–09 NBA season as the Oklahoma City Thunder. =2007–2010: Return to New Orleans= The Hornets franchise returned to New Orleans full-time for the 2007–08 season with all 41 home games played in the New Orleans Arena. League officials had stressed from the beginning the desire for the franchise to return to New Orleans once it proved feasible and that they would make a good- faith effort to assist with the recovery. To that end, the 2008 NBA All-Star Game and its accompanying festivities were awarded to New Orleans and a serious marketing campaign was commenced in February 2007. Subsequently, various corporate sponsorship agreements were signed (under the umbrella of the Crescent City Champions), with Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Capital One, and Cox Communications among them. The Hornets made few organizational changes heading into the 2007–08 season, signing free agents Morris Peterson and Melvin Ely, while letting go of former first round draft pick Cedric Simmons. The club also extended the contract of reserve guard Jannero Pargo and selected Kansas forward Julian Wright with the 13th pick in the 2007 NBA draft. Attendance at the New Orleans Arena, while tepid at first, picked up considerably in the months of March and April 2008 with the team registering sell-outs in 12 of its last 17 regular season home games, and the final 13 total games including playoffs. Healthier than previous seasons, the Hornets held a 29–12 record at the halfway mark. Having the best record in the Western Conference on February 3 meant that Byron Scott would coach the 2008 Western Conference All-Stars at home in the New Orleans Arena. Scott was joined by two of his players, as both Chris Paul and David West were selected as All-Star reserves. Chris Paul was nominated for NBA MVP 2008 and placed second in voting. On February 21, the Hornets made an in-season trade with the Houston Rockets acquiring swingman Bonzi Wells and backup point guard Mike James for veteran guard Bobby Jackson. The Hornets completed the regular season with a record of 56–26, making the season their most successful ever. The Hornets also won their first division title, winning the Southwest Division ahead of the San Antonio Spurs. Having clinched the second overall seed for the Western Conference, the Hornets beat the Dallas Mavericks in the first round. The Hornets won the first two games against the third seed San Antonio Spurs in the Western Conference semi-finals, but eventually lost to the defending champion Spurs three games to four. In August 2008, the Hornets unveiled a modified logo and new uniforms with the colors of Creole blue, purple, and Mardi Gras gold, and after six seasons, the pinstripes were reinstated on the uniforms. The script was changed as an allusion to the wrought iron architecture of New Orleans. An additional third logo was introduced, with the \\"NOLA\\" abbreviation and a trumpet.Hornets new uniforms and logos The team also publicly announced the sale of over 10,000 season tickets for the 2008–09 season. Having experienced the most successful season in franchise history, both in the regular season and the playoffs, the 2009 NBA season was viewed with great expectations for the Hornets franchise. Several pundits picked the Hornets to repeat as winners of the Southwest Division and as a potential Western Conference champion. The core players from the previous season were all back for 2008–09. Swingman James Posey was signed as a free agent from the Boston Celtics in July, while reserve guard Jannero Pargo opted for the Russian Basketball Super League. In December, the Hornets solidified the point guard position by acquiring Antonio Daniels in a three-team deal, giving up seldom-used guard Mike James and a future second-round draft pick. On February 18, the team announced that starting center Tyson Chandler had been traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder for forwards Joe Smith and Chris Wilcox in what was generally perceived as a payroll-shedding move. However, within a day, the trade was rescinded due to concerns regarding Chandler's turf toe. For the second year in a row the Hornets were represented with two players at the NBA All Star Game as Chris Paul was voted in by the fans as a starter, and David West was selected as a reserve by the NBA coaches. The Hornets' 2008–09 season was uneven, with injuries to Tyson Chandler and Peja Stojaković hampering the team's efforts. The Hornets finished the season with a 49–33 record, fourth in the Southwest Division, and seventh in the Western Conference. Facing the Denver Nuggets in the first round of the 2009 NBA Playoffs, the Hornets lost both of the first two games decisively in Denver. They won the third game of the series at home, but then tied the record for worst loss in playoff history with a score of 121–63, which was also the worst defeat in any regular or postseason game for a home team.http://www.nba.com/games/20090427/DENNOH/boxscore.html The Hornets were subsequently eliminated from the 2009 NBA playoffs in game five.http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/playoffs/2009/columns/story?columnist=stein_marc&page;=Hornets-090430 In the aftermath of the 2008–09 NBA season and the in-season attempt to trade starting center Tyson Chandler for expiring contracts, the New Orleans Hornets were widely perceived to be looking to trim the payroll. Indeed, at the start of the NBA free agency period on July 1, the Hornets had the highest payroll of all teams in the league, topping $77 million. When the luxury tax level was set on July 7, it left the Hornets in excess of $7 million in the tax zone. On July 28, the Hornets traded for center Emeka Okafor from the Charlotte Bobcats for Tyson Chandler. While the move allowed the Hornets to shed $1.3 million of the 2009–10 payroll, they also took on the remainder of Okafor's contract valued at just under $63 million for five years. On June 25, 2009, the Hornets drafted Darren Collison with the 21st pick of the 2009 NBA draft. The Hornets also traded two future second round picks to the Miami Heat for the 43rd pick Marcus Thornton. On August 12, 2009, the Hornets traded starter Rasual Butler to the Clippers for a 2016 second round draft pick, in another attempt to lower the payroll. Butler was slated to earn $3.9 million for the season, but due to the Hornets being in the tax zone, those savings were effectively doubled. Further, on September 9, the Hornets traded guard Antonio Daniels to the Minnesota Timberwolves for guard Bobby Brown and forward Darius Songaila. The conscious effort to get below the luxury tax threshold continued during the season. First, backup center Hilton Armstrong was traded along with cash considerations to the Sacramento Kings for a conditional 2016 second round draft pick. Shortly thereafter, starting shooting guard Devin Brown was traded to the Chicago Bulls for reserve center Aaron Gray and backup guard Bobby Brown was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers for a conditional 2nd round draft pick. In total, these trades got the Hornets just below the luxury tax threshold. On the court, head coach Byron Scott was fired on November 12, 2009, after a 3–6 start to the season. General manager Jeff Bower took over the head coaching duties for the remainder of the season. The Hornets overcame the bad start to the season and were as high as sixth in the Western Conference standings in late January. In the second to last game of January, Chris Paul was injured trying to save an errant pass going out of bounds and was out for most of the rest of the season. The few highlights came from rookies Darren Collison and Marcus Thornton; Collison achieved the longest stretch of games with at least 18 points and 9 assists (7 in a row in February) for a rookie since Oscar Robertson and both rookies made the all- rookie teams after the season, a first in franchise history. The Hornets finished the season with a 37–45 record, finishing last in the Southwest Division. Jeff Bower resigned as head coach to concentrate on his front office duties, but was fired by the Hornets on July 13, 2010, ending a tenure of nearly 15 years within the organization. In between Bower's stepping down as head coach and his dismissal from the organization, Monty Williams was brought in as new head coach. The former assistant coach of the Portland Trail Blazers was, at 38 years old, the youngest head coach in the league.Hornets name Williams coach To replace Bower as general manager, the Hornets hired Dell Demps of the San Antonio Spurs in late July. =2010–2012: Roster overhaul and ownership issues= With a new head coach and a new general manager, entered the offseason with uncertainty. Minority owner Gary Chouest was attempting to buy out long-term owner George Shinn and become sole owner of the organization. All-star point guard Chris Paul had also expressed his desire to be on a winning team. The roster was then overhauled for the new coach and manager, while also trying to appease Paul. At the 2010 NBA draft, former lottery pick Cole Aldrich and guard Morris Peterson were traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder for the 21st and 26th picks in the draft, which were subsequently used on forwards Craig Brackins and Quincy Pondexter. On August 11, the Hornets traded rookie Darren Collison and James Posey to the Indiana Pacers for small forward Trevor Ariza from the Houston Rockets in a four-team trade. In a separate trade on the same day, another former lottery pick Julian Wright was traded to the Toronto Raptors for shooting guard Marco Belinelli. On September 23, 2010, the Hornets sent rookie Craig Brackins and power forward Darius Songaila to the Philadelphia 76ers for guard Willie Green and center Jason Smith. Finally, just before the start of the regular season on October 23, the Hornets acquired point guard Jerryd Bayless from the Portland Trail Blazers for a conditional first round draft pick. The overhaul of the roster lead to the team getting younger and more athletic and potentially while simultaneously cutting the relatively underperforming Peterson, Posey and Wright. The cost primarily was the loss of Collison and potentially the future first round draft pick. When the 2010–11 NBA season started, only three players (Paul, West and Stojakovic) were left from the team that won the Southwest Division two years prior. The team started the season with five straight wins, a team record for opening a season. The team then extended the streak to eight straight wins. The team also held their first ten opponents to below 100 points. Later in the season, the team tied a club record with ten straight wins on January 26, 2011. The team qualified for the 2011 NBA Playoffs, where they lost to the Lakers four games to two. Off-court in the 2010–11 season, the buyout by Chouest fell through in early December 2010 and because Shinn was not in a financial position to continue to run the team, the NBA purchased the team for an estimated $300 million while it looked for a local owner. Larry Ellison, CEO of Oracle Corporation who previously tried to buy the Golden State Warriors, said he offered to purchase the team but was \\"slightly outbid\\" by the league. On January 24, 2011, the state, city, and local businesses of New Orleans came together and raised enough money to buy enough tickets to block an escape clause that would have allowed the team to walk away from its lease at New Orleans Arena because of low attendance.Gov. Bobby Jindal praises city for meeting New Orleans Hornets attendance benchmarks but says season tickets are key, Nola.com Before the 2011–12 NBA season, the Hornets were considering trade offers for Chris Paul and he requested a trade to the New York Knicks. The Hornets looked at many teams, including the Boston Celtics and the Golden State Warriors as trade partners, but Paul had made it clear he wanted to be traded to New York or Los Angeles. A three-team trade involving the Los Angeles Lakers and the Houston Rockets was agreed upon, but commissioner David Stern vetoed the trade. On December 14, 2011, the Hornets agreed to a deal with the Los Angeles Clippers that would send Paul to L.A. in exchange for Eric Gordon, Chris Kaman, Al-Farouq Aminu, and a first-round draft pick acquired by the Clippers from a trade with the Minnesota Timberwolves in 2004. At the end of the 66-game lockout- shortened 2011–12 NBA season, the Hornets had the worst record in the West, 21–45. New Orleans Pelicans =2012–2019: Anthony Davis era= On April 13, 2012, it was announced that Tom Benson, owner of the New Orleans Saints, had purchased the franchise from the NBA for $338 million. In addition, Benson announced that he would change the team name to something that would better suit the region, fueling rumors that the Hornets name could one day return to Charlotte, where the Bobcats play.We Beelive: Charlotte...take back your Hornets! Facebook Page In June 2012, Benson appointed two senior Saints executives to supervise the Hornets as well: Saints general manager Mickey Loomis became head of basketball operations, overseeing general manager Dell Demps, and Saints business operations head Dennis Lauscha took on the same role with the Hornets. The Hornets traded Emeka Okafor and Trevor Ariza to the Wizards for Rashard Lewis, whom they bought out, and a draft pick. On May 30, 2012, the Hornets were awarded the first overall pick in the 2012 NBA draft and subsequently drafted Anthony Davis. They also drafted Austin Rivers with the 10th pick (acquired from the Clippers as part of the Chris Paul trade). On July 11, 2012, Ryan Anderson, 2012's Most Improved Player and three-point field goals leader, was acquired in a sign-and-trade by the New Orleans Hornets, with the Orlando Magic, for Gustavo Ayón. New owner Tom Benson had indicated early in his ownership that he wished to change the team's name to something more local, even preferring that the Utah Jazz – founded in New Orleans in 1974 and played there until 1979, give up the \\"Jazz\\" name. But the Jazz indicated they had no interest in returning the name due to over 30 years of history associated with it. Benson had also heavily favored the names \\"Brass\\" and \\"Krewe\\". On December 4, 2012, Yahoo! Sports reported that the Hornets would change their name to the New Orleans Pelicans beginning with the 2013–14 season. The team name is inspired by Louisiana's state bird, the brown pelican. The name \\"Pelicans\\" can be traced back in New Orleans to the 1865 founding of the New Orleans Pelicans, an amateur baseball team. In 1887, the team became a professional franchise when it joined the minor league Southern League which operated off and on until 1899. In 1901, the Pelicans became a founding member of the minor league Southern Association which lasted until 1957. In 1977, the Pelicans name briefly resurfaced for one season when the Triple-A minor league Tulsa Oilers moved to New Orleans before moving to Springfield, Illinois, upon completion of the 1977 season. The Hornets organization unveiled the team's new logos and navy blue-gold-red color scheme in a press conference on January 24, 2013. On April 18, 2013, after the end of the team's 2012–13 season, the team's name was officially changed to the Pelicans. On June 27, 2013, during the 2013 NBA draft, the Pelicans selected Nerlens Noel 6th overall, and traded him along with a 2014 protected first- round pick for All-Star point guard Jrue Holiday of the Philadelphia 76ers and the 42nd pick, Pierre Jackson. Following the New Orleans franchise's 2013 disestablishment of the \\"Hornets\\" name, on May 21, 2013, Charlotte Bobcats owner Michael Jordan announced the organization had submitted an application to change the name of his franchise to the Charlotte Hornets for the 2014–15 NBA season pending a majority vote for approval by the NBA Board of Governors at a meeting in Las Vegas, on July 18, 2013. Then-NBA Deputy Commissioner and COO Adam Silver had previously pointed out the fact that the league owns the rights to the name Hornets and that could speed up the process. The NBA unanimously approved the name change starting with 2014–15. The Bobcats became the Charlotte Hornets on May 20, 2014. In addition, the newly renamed Hornets acquired the records and history of the original Hornets from 1988 to 2002, while the Pelicans kept the remaining records from the 2002–03 season onward. Just before the start of the 2013–2014 season, the Pelicans announced they had broken the 2008–2009 team record for season tickets sold. Sales hit 12,000 season tickets for the first time in franchise history. =2015: Return to the playoffs= Alvin Gentry is the New Orleans Pelicans current head coach. For the second season under the name Pelicans, the team qualified for the playoffs with a 45–37 record as the number 8 seed in the Western Conference. They owned the tie-breaker over the Oklahoma City Thunder by winning the regular season head-to-head series 3–1, and they faced the Golden State Warriors in the first round; the Warriors swept the Pelicans in four games. After the season, the Pelicans fired coach Monty Williams despite qualifying for the playoffs. On May 31, 2015, the Pelicans hired Alvin Gentry as the franchise's 6th head coach. =2019–present: Rebuilding and Brandon Ingram/Zion Williamson era= On April 17, 2019, the Pelicans named David Griffin as the new executive vice president of basketball operations. On May 19, 2019, the Pelicans named former Brooklyn Nets assistant general manager Trajan Langdon their newest general manager, replacing interim general manager Danny Ferry. On June 15, 2019, the Pelicans agreed to trade Davis to the Los Angeles Lakers. In return, the Lakers agreed to send Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart and three first- round picks, including the fourth overall pick in the 2019 NBA draft, to the Pelicans. The Pelicans later agreed to trade draft rights of the fourth overall pick of the 2019 NBA draft to the Atlanta Hawks, receiving the draft rights to the eighth, 17th and 35th picks in the 2019 NBA draft. On June 20, 2019, the Pelicans selected Zion Williamson with the first overall pick. The team also drafted Alen Smailagić and Jordan Bone, both of whom were immediately traded to the Golden State Warriors and Atlanta Hawks, respectively. The Pelicans then received Jaxson Hayes, Nickeil Alexander- Walker and Marcos Louzada Silva from Hawks. On July 1, the Pelicans announced that they signed Williamson to his rookie-scale contract. However, the Pelicans began the 2019–20 season without Williamson as he had a knee surgery following an injury in the preseason. He made his debut on January 22, 2020, scoring 22 points in 18 minutes of play. On March 3, 2020, Williamson was named the NBA Rookie of the Month for the month of February. During the month, Williamson averaged 25.7 points, 6.2 rebounds, 2.6 assists, and 1.0 steal a game. Brandon Ingram had a breakout season. On December 30, 2019, Ingram was named the Western Conference Player of the Week for games played between December 23 to December 29. During the week, Ingram averaged 25.3 points, 7.3 rebounds, 4.5 assists, and 2.0 steals per game while shooting 49.3 percent from the field and 54.2 percent from three-point range. Ingram helped the Pelicans to a 4–0 week as a result. On January 16, 2020, Ingram recorded a career-high by scoring 49 points in a 138–132 overtime win against the Utah Jazz. Ingram gave the Pelicans a one-point lead with a fadeaway jumper with 0.2 seconds remaining in regulation. This was before Rudy Gobert was fouled and subsequently sent the game to overtime with a free throw. Because of his breakout season, Ingram became an NBA All-Star for the first time in his career.

It first flew in 1923 and the type was used for tests until 1926 when the project was cancelled. Development Following World War I, the U.S. Navy Bureau of Aeronautics conducted studies concerning the possibility of submarine-borne observation and scouting aircraft. After surfacing, this plane should be rolled out and quickly assembled. It was planned to launch the seaplane by ballasting the submarine until the deck was awash. The Navy ordered two types of aircraft, the Martin MS-1, constructed of wood and fabric, and the all- metal Cox-Klemin XS. The MS-1 first flew from Lake Erie in early 1923. Operational history The submarine S-1 became the experimental platform for the operation of scout seaplanes late in 1923. The MS-1 and the Cox-Klemin XS were used for the trials, mounted in a cylindrical pod behind the conning tower. The first successful attempt was made on 5 November 1923. The first full cycle of surfacing, assembly, launching, retrieving, disassembly, and submergence took place on 28 July 1926, on the Thames River at New London, Connecticut using the XS-2.http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/s1/s-1.htm A total of six Martin MS-1s were built, with all six still being listed with the U.S. Navy as late as 1926.

Ali not only steals the suitcase with the money, but also attempts to steal the car, but is stopped by one of the gangsters. The policeman arrives just in time and goes after the attacker. Ali takes advantage of the confusion and gets away in the car. He escapes with the suitcase, and takes it back to the tailor shop. There his accomplice from the drug deal shows up, but the three tailors hide Ali. He needs to go underground for a few days. After packing he opens the suitcase and a dye packet explodes in his face and all over his white tee shirt. At that moment the doorbell rings—his family is there. Background Schaible has his roots with the Hamburg Hip Hop label Eimsbush. After working as a lighting technician for various cinema and television productions and later gaining initial directing experience with music videos, he made the 33-minute short feature film 3 Engel für Ali in 2003. The colour film was produced in German and Turkish with German subtitles. In 2003 it was shown as part of the programme at the Hof International Film Festival. The leading role is played by Bülent Çelebi, the hip-hop musician also known as B-Low. His partner in the hip-hop duo Tobias \\"Tobby Digg\\" Iliev-Granow also plays a leading role.

It is constructed from pieces of gold sheet in a gammadion shape, embedded within layers of silica. When irradiated with light from a laser, the gold pieces rotate. The functioning is explained by the quantum concept of the plasmon. This type of nanomotor is much smaller than other types, and its operation can be controlled by varying the frequency of the incident light. A working demonstration model has been produced by researchers with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of California, Berkeley.

Introduction  The increased demands in microtechnology and nanotechnology has been triggering the vast interests and opportunities for the developments of various micro- (MEMS) and nano-(NEMS) mechanical system based products. One of the features of this technology is its unique ability to imitate various natural phenomena. For example, biomedical engineering has succeeded to replace and increase the function of damaged or diseased organs,Ashutosh A.; Henry H. Journal of Nanotechnology in Engineering and Medicine, Vol 1, February, 2010 by designing the artificial ones using the nanoscale approach. The science behind the nanotechnology help them to design devices used for transplantation in medicine, suggesting that one should understand how nanoscale devices work by exploring living cells and its working principles. It could certainly inspire the ideas behind the design of powerful devices. Mechanism of auto- regeneration of energy by microorganisms has drawn attention to understand how energy can be generated from nanomaterials. As demonstrated in the works of various researchers, nanotechnology has a great ability to power and improve several natural biological devices by replacing those entities and mimicking natural processes within the living being. The primary concern behind such an approach is to provide an alternative source with higher ability under a controlled environment. One of the breakthrough discoveries among them is the nanomotor, a tiny device which has the ability to convert various forms of energy into motion using approaches observed in nature. The discovery in this field explains the use of wave and particle properties together to make the nanomotor work. This leads to observation of the so-called plasmonic nanomotor using the properties of plasmon to make the nanomotor work.Brongersma M.L., Zia R., Schuller J.A., Applied Physics A: Materials Science & Processing,89,221-223(2007) Researchers with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)'s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of California (UC) Berkeley have created the first nano-sized light mill motor whose rotational speed and direction can be controlled by tuning the frequency of the incident light waves.  Background  Nanomotors are broadly classified into biological, hybrid and non-biological ones. Biological nanomotors are typically the microscopic engines created by the nature like the bacterial flagella which can come into motion by using ATP synthase, produced within the cell. This motor allows the bacterial to move independently. The man made counterpart is called a non-biological nanomotor and mimics the function of natural or biological nanomotor to allow the devices to work. However, these man-made nanodevices are less efficient compared to the biological counterpart. They require certain functionalization to accelerate movement or to improve the functions of the artificial nanomotor. For instance incorporation of carbon nanotube into platinum component of asymmetric metal nanowire leads to its dramatically accelerated movement in hydrogen peroxide solution. The hybrid nanomotor uses the chemical principle which are regularly observed in the biological nanomotor and other principles like magnetic interactions to perform their functions.Wei G., Kalayil M. Manesh, Joe H., Sirilak S., and Joseph W; small 2011, 7, No. 14, 2047–2051 The motion of a nanomotor could result from optical, electrical, magnetic or chemical interactions. These principles are applied according to the scale of the materials we are dealing with. One of the breakthrough reports on nanomotor is the possibility to use energy from the quantum behavior of photons to induce motion in the devices, where the authors were able to induce and control rotation, velocity and directions of nanosized gold (motor) within silica microdisk. This relevant report pointed out that velocity, direction and rotation were strongly dependent on the nature of light (wavelength) impinging upon the motor.  Working principle  Mostly photons exhibit linear momentum as well as angular momentum. These properties attribute towards different phenomena like induction of mechanical torque, optical trapping and cooling both in macro scale and nanoscale observations. Plasmon is the resonant mode that involves the interaction between free charges and light. In a metallic nanostructure, when the applied electric field is resonant with its plasmons, the interaction between light and matter can be greatly enhanced. Free electrons in metals can be driven by the interaction of these plasmon waves of metals and the electric field, generated by the incident light. This phenomenon also modifies the light by influencing its electric and magnetic field. The whole process induces the optical torque which can give a motion to the metallic nanostructures.  Experimental configuration  Based on the plasmonic concept, Liu and coworker demonstrated the plasmonic motor at nanoscale. The gammadion-shaped nanostructures were made up of Gold (size ~ 190x 190 nm) which were symmetrically sandwiched between two Silicon dioxide layers. The whole system was fabricated by using standard electron beam lithography. When the system is illuminated with linearly polarized light, it produces a torque which drives these tiny nanostructures, called \\"plasmonic nanomotors\\". The imposed torque results solely from the gammadion structure’s symmetry and interaction with the incident light. These nanomotors seems to change their directions of motions (clockwise and anticlockwise) according to the wavelength (longer and shorter) of the incident laser beam.  Applications  Because of its size and driven energy, the nanoscale plasmonic motor could provide rotational force at nanoscale, which would be widely used in energy conversion and biology. =In biology= The structural dynamics of cellular processes such as replication and transcription could determine the mechanical properties of DNA. However, the effect of torque should be considered when measuring DNA mechanics. Under low tension, DNA behaves like an isotropic flexible rod; whereas at higher tensions, the behaviour of over- and underwound molecules differs. When the nanoscale plasmonic motor is used, torsional stress will build up in the molecule by holding the rotor bead stationary using fluid flow. Through observing the twist angle of DNA, the elastic properties of DNA could be obtained. The newly developed light-driven nanoscale motor could address the limitations of the earlier light mills. It generates comparable torque, which was made of gold and had much smaller size. At 100 nanometers (one-tenth the size of other motors) it would make possible applications like unwinding DNA in living cells. While the system is under controlled winding and unwinding of DNA, the small motor could be illuminated at different wavelengths for in vivo manipulation. = In energy conversion = The microelectromechanical system is different from the traditional electromechanical system. For the nanoscale plasmonic motor, it could harvest light energy through rotating microscopic-scale objects. In addition, a nanoscale plasmonic motor could link transduction mechanisms in series (e.g., convert a thermal signal first into a mechanical signal, then into an optical signal, and finally into an electrical signal). So these motors could apply to solar light harvesting in nanoscopic systems through designing multiple motors to work at different resonance frequencies and single directions. And such multiple motor structures could be used to acquire torque from a broad wavelength range instead of a single frequency.  Limitations  In the past, nanoparticles were rotated by exploiting the incident intrinsic movement of the light, but it is the first time to induce the rotation of a nanoparticle without exploiting the intrinsic angular momentum of light. Because the nanoscale plasmonic motor is a new technology, several problems are faced, such as the price of higher development costs, greater complexity and a longer development time and the workhorse methods and materials of nanometre-scale electromechanical system (NEMS) technology are not universally well suited to the nanoscale. The nanoscale plasmonic motor also has limitations in strength and flexibility.  Future plans  In the future, scientists will pay more attention to synthesis, the efficiency of the light mills. Alternative materials for motors also will be developed as substitutes for the expensive materials - such as gold, silicon, carbon nanotube - used in the experimental stage. The strength and flexibility of nanoscale plasmonic motors will also be improved.

Chakussanga had a close relationship with those in his community, particularly the Southern Mbundu, known as the Ovimbundu, one of Angola's largest ethnic groups, made up largely of rebels. Radio Despertar, the station Chakussanga reported for, was being accused of continuously encouraging the community to cause civil disobedience in retaliation to the government, which the station adamantly refused doing. The station was created after \\"peace accords\\" between the MPLA, which is the ruling group, and UNITA when it ended its armed rebellion. According to the CPJ, the station was affiliated with the latter, or the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola. Chakussanga spoke out against the government during this turbulent time. In January 2010, he began segments that contained discussions about political education for the people of Angola. According to friends and acquaintances, Chakussanga received threatening phone calls and text message in the months before his death.  Impact  Chakussanga's death was a violent act that affected his audience, as well as other media outlets in southern Africa. His show criticized the MPLA in Angola. According to Media Institute for Southern Africa, his death was an indication of all those against media freedom and who wish to silence objecting opinions.  Reactions  Irina Bokova, the director-general of UNESCO, condemned the deaths of four journalists from the previous week on 11 September 2010, which included Alberto Chakussanga.

Government-Lawyer-in-Residence Program. Retired government experts volunteer at the GLC to mentor students, write on specialized topics, assist with municipal government projects, and oversee law-related events. History The Government Law Center was founded in 1978, the product of a grant initiated at the federal level and administered by New York State through the New York State Department of State, under the leadership of Mario M. Cuomo as then-Secretary of State. Cuomo worked with Albany Law School Professors Sandra Stevenson and Bernard Harvith to secure a grant through the United States Office of Personnel Management and the United States Civil Service Commission. Professor Sandra Stevenson served as the GLC's Director for a few months before J. Langdon Marsh became the first full-time director of the GLC on March 1, 1979 The Center contracted with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation to prepare its first state legal report in 1980, titled \\"Selected Legal Problems in the Control of Hazardous Wastes.\\" The Center proceeded to enter into contracts with several New York State agencies, including the New York State Department of Social Services, Adirondack Park Agency, New York State Department of State, New York State Department of Health, and with the New York State Legislature, to produce reports and offer training. Under Marsh's direction, the Center also focused on issues related to hazardous waste, zoning and planning, environmental quality review, economic development, and local government. Marsh left the Center in July 1983, and for a brief time following, Joseph W. Bellacosa served as the Center's director. He subsequently was appointed by then-New York State Governor Mario M. Cuomo to serve as a Judge on the Court of Claims and Chief Administrative Judge of all State Courts, followed by a fourteen-year term on the New York Court of Appeals. In 1983, Professor Sandra M. Stevenson was re- appointed Associate Dean and Director of the Government Law Center, assuming the position she had held in the first months of the Center's existence. During her tenure, the GLC conducted training programs in alternative dispute resolution (ADR) and tying ADR to intellectual property. Under Stevenson's leadership in 1989, Albany Law School and the Government Law Center became the official repository for tapes of oral arguments heard before the New York Court of Appeals. In 1990, Professor George F. Carpinello was appointed Director. Under Carpinello, the Center introduced the Warren M. Anderson Legislative Breakfast Seminar Series, a series focused on topics of interest to legislators and policy makers, named for the former President Pro Tem and Majority Leader of the New York State Senate. The GLC also began producing a newsletter for the County Attorneys Association of New York State (CAASNY), prepared the first edition of Legal Careers in New York State Government (with later editions published by the New York State Bar Association), and placed student interns in the counsel's office of various state agencies. Patricia E. Salkin, Raymond and Ella Smith Distinguished Professor of Law and Associate Dean of Albany Law School, was appointed Director of the GLC in 1992, and served as the Center's Director until her appointment as dean of the Touro College Jacob D. Fuchsberg Law Center in 2012. In the first years under Salkin's leadership, the GLC began the Edgar and Margaret Sandman Fellowship in Aging and Health Law, and created the Senior Citizen's Law Day, a day-long program providing local seniors with free seminars on important issues related to aging. The Aging Law and Policy Program was established in 1994 to focus on issues related to aging. In 1994, the GLC also received funding through the United States Department of Education to create the Mediation Assistance Program to train and state-certify law and non-law students as volunteer mediators for New York's Community Dispute Settlement Program, leading to the establishment of the Program on Public Policy Dispute Resolution to focus on issues emerging in this field. In the years that followed, a number of additional programs were initiated. The Lawrence F. Klepper Legal Assistance Program for Non-Profit Organizations, helping to place law students with attorneys who provide pro bono or very low-cost services to nonprofits, was established at the GLC in 1994 by friends of the former Executive Director of the Legal Aid Society and with the support of Congregation Beth Emeth. The Edwin L. Crawford Memorial Lecture in Municipal Law was launched in 1996 to address issues of state and national importance to municipal officials. In 1998, the GLC's Government Law Network began as a way for people working in or with government to meet key law and policy makers at exclusive \\"Networking Breakfast\\" forums. The Center's Alumni Leaders in Government Networking Series provided students with an opportunity to interact with notable Albany Law School graduates. In 1999, the GLC together with the Albany Law Clinic and Justice Center established the Semester in Government Program, offering students full-time internships in government counsel offices in Albany and Washington, D.C. The Center also began producing The Government Law & Policy Journal for the New York State Bar Association's Committee on Attorneys in Public Service. In 2000, the GLC started providing services for the City of Albany's newly created Citizen's Police Review Board, established by a law calling upon an academic institution to support the oversight of law enforcement. The GLC moved to its new location on the Albany Law School campus in 2001. The same year, the Center hosted the annual \\"Saratoga Institute on Racing and Gaming Law\\" as part of its Program on Racing and Gaming Law. The Center also received funding from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development to expand mediation services for area housing communities. In 2002, the GLC and Squire, Sanders and Dempsey began sponsoring the William B. Sanders Law and Public Policy Forum. New York State officials such as former Governor David A. Paterson, then Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver have participated. The Government Lawyer in Residence program at the GLC was established in 2002 to give the Center and law students the resources of a former government attorney. The GLC also produced a new edition of the Manual for Administrative Law Judges and Hearing Officers published by the New York State Department of Civil Service; a conference on the 30th anniversary of the Adirondack Park; New York's first conference on \\"smart growth\\"; a program to mark the 25th anniversary of the State Environmental Quality Review Act; and a symposium on siting new power plants in New York. The GLC hosted the inaugural Nancy M. Sills '76 Memorial Lecture, featuring then-Lieutenant Governor Mary O. Donohue, at the 10th Annual Senior Citizen's Law Day in 2003. The Summer in Government was also introduced as a way to provide students with internship placements with government lawyers in Albany. In 2004 the GLC, in partnership with public television station WMHT, produced \\"Inside the Inner Circle,\\" focused on the process of state policymaking, featuring former counsels to five New York governors. In 2005 the Center introduced Graduate and Post-Graduate Fellowships for law and policy research and a Faculty Affiliate program to augment its research capability. Historian and scholar Paul Finkelman was named Senior Faculty Fellow at the GLC and Albany Law School's President William McKinley Distinguished Professor of Law and Public Policy. The Clarence D. \\"Rapp\\" Rappleyea Government Lawyer in Residence Program was established to recognize the former State Assembly Minority Leader. In 2005 - 2007, the GLC took on a number of new projects: a series of procurement law initiatives to help improve New York State's procurement process and identify potential areas of reform in the 1995 Procurement Stewardship Act; providing technical assistance related to consolidations, mergers, dissolutions, cooperative agreements and shared services as part of the Shared Municipal Services Incentive (SMSI) Grant Program, under a contract with the New York State Department of State; establishing a Non-Profit Legal Assistance Program with the assistance of then-U.S. Congressman Michael R. McNulty; and the establishment of the Public Authorities Project, to provide research on legal aspects of public policy issues facing public authorities. The GLC also hosted a number of conferences and programs during 2005 - 2007, including: a Cornell University co-sponsored invitational series on New York State water resources; a national teleconference on the legal aspects of commercializing hydrogen technology; a forum on the siting of wind facilities in New York, in partnership with the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA); a national teleconference series on renewable energy, sponsored by the American Council on Renewable Energy; and a symposium on municipal broadband and WiFi policies, in cooperation with the New York State Office for Technology, the New York State Public Service Commission, the New York State Department of State, and the Empire State Development Corporation. To celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Ethics in Government Act, the GLC convened a symposium in 2007 keynoted by former Fordham Law School Dean John Feerick. The Government Law Center proceeded to sponsor and co-sponsor numerous conferences in 2008 - 2009, including a 2009 conference on building in the 21st century, co-sponsored with the American Institute of Architects, New York State and the New York City Bar Association; a symposium on E-FOIL and the impact of technology on accessing records featuring Miriam Nisbet, Director of the Office of Government Information Services, United States National Archives and Records Administration; and a symposium on preserving executive records in 2010, with former Governor of Pennsylvania and United States Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and presidential historian Richard Norton Smith. In 2010 - 2011, in conjunction with the Albany Law School's Albany Law Review, the GLC held symposia on education reform with Charles Rose, General Counsel for the United States Department of Education; baseball and the law, featuring John Thorn, Major League Baseball's official Baseball Historian; and on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights, keynoted by Jeh Johnson, General Counsel for the United States Department of Defense. When Salkin left to become Dean of Touro College Jacob D. Fuchsberg Law Center in 2012, Assistant Professor Robert Heverly, who had served as the assistant director of the GLC from 1992 to 2001, became the GLC interim director. He was succeeded in 2013 by Assistant Professor Ray Brescia. Brescia served as the GLC director until May 2016. Under Brescia's leadership, the GLC began an initiative to bolster economic development, entrepreneurship, emerging technologies, and economic justice. The GLC established a regional innovation lab through the Community Loan Fund of the Capital Region to provide technical support on critical housing and economic initiatives and to combat urban blight. Former U.S. Senator George Mitchell spoke about his experiences negotiating the Good Friday peace agreement at an event presented by the GLC and the Rockefeller Institute of Government. Judge Sterling Johnson, U.S. District Judge for the Eastern District of New York, delivered the Crawford Lecture on police-community relations. The GLC hosted a panel of newly elected women mayors of upstate New York, including Hon. Kathy Sheehan ’94 of Albany, the Hon. Lovely Warren ’03 of Rochester. The Center co- sponsored a conversation with former State Comptroller H. Carl McCall and other experts examining whether a constitutional convention can be the vehicle for state ethics reforms in New York. Former New York Lieutenant Governor Richard Ravitch related his experiences as special advisor to the U.S. Bankruptcy Judge in Detroit at a program on the Detroit process and what lessons New York can learn from it. The GLC held a panel discussion, in conjunction with the New York State Committee on Open Government, on the Freedom of Information Law, its evolution of the past forty years, and what may lie ahead in an age of ubiquitous data. Former New York Governor David Paterson addressed a forum on executive authority and the budget process, co- presented with the Rockefeller Institute of Government. The GLC's conference on combatting slavery in the 21st century, held at the United Nations, was simulcast worldwide. The GLC commemorated the 25th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act by hosting a conference highlighting the civil rights law's history and implementation and examining the challenges ahead. It presented a series on end-of-life care exploring legal and regulatory questions, as well as medical, ethical, financial, societal, and religious matters. In 2016, the GLC established the Rural Law Initiative to bring legal assistance to small and start-up businesses in rural Upstate New York, where there is a shortage of attorneys. The new program was made possible by funding from the USDA. During Brescia's tenure, Albany Law was ranked first in the country by preLaw magazine's 2016 winter issue for preparing students for career in government, partly due to the work of the GLC and the opportunities it provides students. This included a new student initiative through which entering students could become Government Law Center Fellows. Bennett Liebman, former executive director of the Government Law Center, served as acting director of the GLC from June 2016 until Andrew B. Ayers took over as GLC director in November 2016. During the spring 2017 semester, the Government Law Center Fellows met as a group with Honorable Sonia Sotomayor, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, during her visit to Albany Law School. The transcript of Justice Sotomayor's appearance at Albany Law School was published in the Albany Law Review in 2018, with an introduction by GLC Director Andy Ayers. In 2017, the GLC partnered with Albany Law School's Institute for Financial Market Regulation to host a program on the problem of vacant and abandoned properties, or blight. The Honorable Thomas J. Vilsack ’75, former U.S. Secretary of Agriculture, received the Honorable James P. King '59 Lifetime Achievement in Public Service Award at the Albany Law School and Government Law Center Alumni in Government Awards event held on April 27, 2017. In November 2017, the Rockefeller Institute of Government, in partnership with the Government Law Center, the Rockefeller College of Public Affairs at the University at Albany, and the University at Buffalo School of Law, announced the formation of the new Center for Law and Policy Solutions, or CLPS, to examine pressing issues at the intersection of law and policy in light of their effects on local communities. During 2017–2018, the GLC and the Rockefeller Institute of Government partnered to publish One Hundred and Six Ideas for Constitutional Change and Protections in the New York State Constitution Beyond the Federal Bill of Rights. The Center released research reports on the history of Union College's involvement in New York State's largest lottery and on ambiguities in Section 107 of New York's general ethics law addressing politics in the workplace. From 2017–2018, the Rural Law Initiative hosted two programs for craft business attorneys and a program on succession planning for farmers, rural lawyers and other community stakeholders. In partnership with the University at Albany's Center for Human Services Research, the RLI surveyed attorneys registered in New York's rural counties to better understand that demographic. It launched a new website of legal resources for rural-based entrepreneurs and businesses. In 2018, the GLC launched its explainer series of short policy papers designed to help policymakers and others understand the complex laws that apply to state and local governments' choices about immigration policy. The GLC, in partnership with the Community Loan Fund of the Capital Region, awarded six fellowships to Albany Law School students to support their summer 2018 internships in the fields of community development and economic justice. On July 19, 2018, the Government Law Center and the Rockefeller Institute of Government presented a program on the increasing relevance of state constitutions in debates about protections for immigrants, reproductive rights, affirmative action, environmental protections, and LGBTQ rights. In September 2018, they released a policy brief, What Happens to Abortion in New York if Brett Kavanaugh is Confirmed? Funding The Government Law Center is funded by Albany Law School, corporate and foundation support, contracts and grants, and through individual donations. Government Law Center Advisory Board An Advisory Board, composed of the Albany Law School faculty and leaders from the public, private and non-profit sectors, assists the GLC's Director in charting future initiatives.

A golden yellow solid with high electrical conductivity, it belongs to a group of compounds called transition metal dichalcogenides, which consist of the stoichiometry ME2. TiS2 has been employed as a cathode material in rechargeable batteries. Structure TiS2 adopts a hexagonal close packed (hcp) structure, analogous to cadmium iodide (CdI2). In this motif, half of the octahedral holes are filled with a \\"cation\\", in this case Ti4+. Each Ti centre is surrounded by six sulfide ligands in an octahedral structure. Each sulfide is connected to three Ti centres, the geometry at S being pyramidal. Several metal dichalcogenides adopt similar structures, but some, notably MoS2, do not. The layers of TiS2 consist of covalent Ti-S bonds. The individual layers of TiS2 are bound together by van der Waals forces, which are relatively weak intermolecular forces. It crystallises in the space group Pm1. The Ti-S bond lengths are 2.423 Å. Cartoon for intercalation of Li into TiS2 cathode. The process involves swelling of one crystal axis and charge transfer from Li to Ti. =Intercalation= The single most useful and most studied property of TiS2 is its ability to undergo intercalation upon treatment with electropositive elements. The process is a redox reaction, illustrated in the case of lithium: :TiS2 \\\\+ Li → LiTiS2 LiTiS2 is generally described as Li+[TiS2−]. During the intercalation and deintercalation, a range of stoichimetries are produced with the general formul LixTiS2 (x < 1). During intercalation, the interlayer spacing expands (the lattice \\"swells\\") and the electrical conductivity of the material increases. Intercalation is facilitated because of the weakness of the interlayer forces as well as the susceptibility of the Ti(IV) centers toward reduction. Intercalation can be conducted by combining a suspension of the disulfide material and a solution of the alkali metal in anhydrous ammonia. Alternatively solid TiS2 reacts with the alkali metal upon heating. The Rigid-Band Model (RBM), which assumes that electronic band structure does not change with intercalation, describes changes in the electronic properties upon intercalation. Deintercalation is the opposite of intercalation; the cations diffuse out from between the layers. This process is associated with recharging a Li/TiS2 battery. Intercalation and deintercalation can be monitored by cyclic voltammetry. The microstructure of the titanium disulfide greatly affects the intercalation and deintercalation kinetics. Titanium disulfide nanotubes have a higher uptake and discharge capacity than the polycrystalline structure. The higher surface area of the nanotubes is postulated to provide more binding sites for the anode ions than the polycrystalline structure. Material properties Formally containing the d0 ion Ti4+ and closed shell dianion S2−, TiS2 is essentially diamagnetic. Its magnetic susceptibility is 9 x 10−6 emu/mol, the value being sensitive to stoichiometry. Titanium disulfide is a semimetal, meaning there is small overlap of the conduction band and valence band. =High pressure properties= The properties of titanium disulfide powder have been studied by high pressure synchrotron x-ray diffraction (XRD) at room temperature. At ambient pressure, TiS2 behaves as semiconductor while at high pressures of 8 GPa the material behaves as a semimetal. At 15 GPa, the transport properties change. There is no significant change in the density of states at the Fermi level up to 20 GPa and phase change does not occur until 20.7 GPa. A change in the structure of TiS2 was observed at a pressure of 26.3 GPa, although the new structure of the high pressure phase has not been determined. The unit cell of titanium disulfide is 3.407 by 5.695 angstroms. The size of the unit cell decreased at 17.8 GPa. The decrease in unit cell size was greater than was observed for MoS2 and WS2, indicating that titanium disulfide is softer and more compressible. The compression behavior of titanium disulfide is anisotropic. The axis parallel to S-Ti-S layers (c-axis) is more compressible than the axis perpendicular to S-Ti-S layers (a-axis) because of weak van der waals forces keeping S and Ti atoms together. At 17.8 GPa, the c-axis is compressed by 9.5% and the a-axis is compressed by 4%. The longitudinal sound velocity is 5284 m/s in the plane parallel to S-Ti-S layers. The longitudinal sound velocity perpendicular to the layers is 4383 m/s. Synthesis Titanium disulfide is prepared by the reaction of the elements around 500 °C. :Ti + 2 S → TiS2 It can be more easily synthesized from titanium tetrachloride, but this product is typically less pure than that obtained from the elements. :TiCl4 \\\\+ 2 H2S → TiS2 \\\\+ 4 HCl This route has been applied to the formation of TiS2 films by chemical vapor deposition. Thiols and organic disulfides can be employed in place of hydrogen sulfide. A variety of other titanium sulfides are known. =Chemical properties of TiS2= Samples of TiS2 are unstable in air. Upon heating, the solid undergoes oxidation to titanium dioxide: :TiS2 \\\\+ O2 → TiO2 \\\\+ 2 S TiS2 is also sensitive to water: :TiS2 \\\\+ 2H2O → TiO2 \\\\+ 2 H2S Upon heating, TiS2 releases sulfur, forming the titanium(III) derivative: :2 TiS2 → Ti2S3 \\\\+ S =Sol-gel synthesis= Thin films of TiS2 have been prepared by the sol-gel process from titanium isopropoxide (Ti(OPri)4) followed by spin coating. This method affords amorphous material that crystallised at high temperatures to hexagonal TiS2, which crystallization orientations in the [001], [100], and [001] directions. Because of their high surface area, such films are attractive for battery applications. =Unusual morphologoes of TiS2= More specialized morphologies - nanotubes, nanoclusters, whiskers, nanodisks, thin films, fullerenes - are prepared by combining the standard reagents, often TiCl4 in unusual ways. For example, flower-like morphologies were obtain by treating a solution of sulfur in 1-octadecene with titanium tetrachloride. Fullerene- like materials A form of TiS2 with a fullerene-like structure has been prepared using the TiCl4/H2S method. The resulting spherical structures have diameters between 30 and 80 nm. Owing to their spherical shape, these fullerenes exhibit reduced friction coefficient and wear, which may prove useful in various applications. Nanotubes Nanotubes of TiS2 can be synthesized using a variation of the TiCl4/H2S route. According to transmission electron microscopy (TEM), these tubes have an outer diameter of 20 nm and an inner diameter of 10 nm. The average length of the nanotubes was 2-5 µm and the nanotubes were proven to be hollow. TiS2 nanotubes with open ended tips are reported to store up to 2.5 weight percent hydrogen at 25 ⁰C and 4 MPa hydrogen gas pressure. Absorption and desorption rates are fast, which is an attractive for hydrogen storage. The hydrogen atoms are postulated to bind to sulfur. Nanoclusters and nanodisks Nanoclusters, or quantum dots of TiS2 have distinctive electronic and chemical properties due to quantum confinement and very large surface to volume ratios. Nanoclusters can be synthesized using micelle. The nanoclusters are prepared from a solution of TiCl4 in tridodecylmethyl ammonium iodide (TDAI), which served as the inverse micelle structure and seeded the growth of nanoclusters in the same general reaction as nanotubes. Nucleation only occurs inside the micelle cage due to the insolubility of the charged species in the continuous medium, which is generally a low dielectric constant inert oil. Like the bulk material, nanocluster-form of TiS2 is a hexagonal layered structure. . Quantum confinement creates well separated electronic states and increases the band gap more than 1 eV in comparison to the bulk material. A spectroscopic comparison shows a large blueshift for the quantum dots of 0.85 eV. Nanodisks of TiS2 arise by treating TiCl4 with sulfur in oleylamine. Applications :A battery is shown using titanium disulfide as a cathode. Lithium ions intercalate and deintercalate the layered titanium disulfide cathode as the battery is charged and discharged. The promise of titanium disulfide as a cathode material in rechargeable batteries was described in 1973 by M. Stanley Whittingham. The Group IV and V dichalcogenides attracted attention for their high electrical conductivities. The originally described battery used a lithium anode and a titanium disulfide cathode. This battery had high energy density and the diffusion of lithium ions into the titanium disulfide cathode was reversible, making the battery rechargeable. Titanium disulfide was chosen because it is the lightest and cheapest chalcogenide. Titanium disulfide also has the fastest rate of lithium ion diffusion into the crystal lattice. The main problem was degradation of the cathode after multiple recycles. This reversible intercalation process allows the battery to be rechargeable. Additionally, titanium disulfide is the lightest and the cheapest of all group IV and V layered dichalcogenides. In the 1990s, titanium disulfide was replaced by other cathode materials (manganese and cobalt oxides) in most rechargeable batteries. The use of TiS2 cathodes remains of interest for use in solid-state lithium batteries, e.g., for hybrid electric vehicles and plug- in electric vehicles. In contrast to the all-solid state batteries, most lithium batteries employ liquid electrolytes, which pose safety issues due to their flammability. Many different solid electrolytes have been proposed to replace these hazardous liquid electrolytes. For most solid-state batteries, high interfacial resistance lowers the reversibility of the intercalation process, shortening the life cycle. These undesirable interfacial effects are less problematic for TiS2. One all-solid-state lithium battery exhibited a power density of 1000 W/kg over 50 cycles with a maximum power density of 1500 W/kg. Additionally, the average capacity of the battery decreased by less than 10% over 50 cycles. Although titanium disulfide has high electrical conductivity, high energy density, and high power, its discharge voltage is relatively low compared to other lithium batteries where the cathodes have higher reduction potentials.

Carbon nanotube supported catalyst is a novel supported catalyst, using carbon nanotubes as the support instead of the conventional alumina or silicon support. The exceptional physical properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) such as large specific surface areas, excellent electron conductivity incorporated with the good chemical inertness, and relatively high oxidation stability makes it a promising support material for heterogeneous catalysis.Dresselhaus, M.

(the \\"Gold Book\\") (1997). Online corrected version: (2006–) \\"catalyst\\" One or more kinds of catalysts can be loaded on another material with a high surface area, which serves as the support, to form a supported catalyst as a whole system. In a supported catalyst system, the significance of using the support are to increase the dispersion of the active phases, to have a better control of the porous structure, to improve mechanical strength, to prevent sintering and to assist catalysis. There is a wide spectrum of supports ranging from conventional and most commonly alumina to novel various kinds of activated carbon. Synthesis methods and functions vary greatly due to different kinds of support and catalytic materials. The challenge in making a supported nanoparticulate catalyst is to avoid agglomeration. This can be achieved by using a poly-functional anchoring agent, and drying under a relatively low temperature. Relative research are deposition of palladium and platinum particles on activated carbon, using a poly-acrylate anchor.Hwang, Gan-Lin (2003) \\"Carbon nanocapsule supported catalysts\\" To unveil more molecular details of the extensive interactions between precursors and supports in an aqueous environment, studies of adsorption and precipitation chemistry must be taken into account. Progress is being made in the use of chemical vapor deposition for the synthesis of supported catalysts. Combinatorial techniques have seen their contributions to solid catalyst synthesis. Background =Catalyst supports and supported catalysts= Catalysts are widely used in various chemical reactions. The activity, stability, selectivity, and regeneration ability are the most important properties to be considered in catalyst design. The catalyst supports can improve specific properties such as mechanical strength, distribution, stability, catalytical reactivity and selectivity of catalysts. The definition of the support is broad: the shape of support varies, including granular, powdered, colloidal, coprecipitated, extruded, pelleted, spherical, wires, honeycombs, and skeletal supports. Catalyst supports can be either inert or active in reactions. The ensemble of the catalyst and its support can be regarded as an entirety: supported catalyst. In pre-1940 publications, the supports were only considered as physical carriers on which the catalytic metal or oxide was disposed as broadly and uniformly as possible. But over the years, a better understanding of the cofunctioning of catalysts and their supports has been achieved. It was recognized that the support was actually a promoter in many cases. In Catalysis (Berkman et al. 1940), the difference between a promoter and a support is described as the difference in quantity: when the support exceeds the quantity of the catalyst, it is a support; otherwise it is a promoter. This view was more or less simplistic, but implied the recognition that even at this early year the support was a catalytic component in the broadly construed catalytic composition. An early purpose of the support was to obtain a solid granular material coated with catalytic component, providing a hard and stable structure to withstand disintegration under gas or liquid flows. Another purpose to load catalytical noble metal on supports is to dilute noble metals in a larger volume. Some supports act as a stabilizer to prevent lower- melting-point materials from agglomeration. Another use of the support was to serve as a reservoir for semimolten salts. Many experiments about alumina were conducted at the early period, which helped people to realize that catalysts supported on different species of alumina have different catalytic properties. (4-5-66) \\"Method of Preparing a Catalyst Composition Consisting of Eta-Alumina and the Product Thereof\\" (6-1-65) \\"Method of Preparing a Nickel Oxide Alumina Composition and the Product Thereof\\" During the same time frame, it was noticed that the catalyst and the support were cooperating in some cases to produce two simultaneous and mutually beneficial reactions. This was called the dual-functioning catalyst and was observed in those hydrodenitrogenation, hydrodesulfurization, and reforming catalysts reactions. =Traditional carbon materials as supports= Carbon is a ubiquitous element that forms millions of compounds, ranging from simple carbon monoxide to highly complex enzymes. Regarding to its elemental form, although there is no catalytic properties ascribed to diamond, graphite is known to be an active catalyst in some oxidation reactions. Graphitic carbon is also used as a support material where other catalytic components may be dispersed, resulting in an increase of the surface area they expose to the chemical reactants. The applications of graphite, carbon black and activated charcoal manufactured annually as catalyst support are relatively few. The major catalytical use of charcoals and carbon blacks is to support metals. In addition, charcoals are sometimes used to support compounds such as sulfides and halides. Some graphite is used to support metals, but the most important feature of graphite is its ability to form intercalates, which are the catalysts for some hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, isomerization, alkylation, hydrodealkylation, polymerization and ammonia formation reactions. For charcoal and carbon black-supported metals with various industrial uses, the methods of manufacture can be divided into three broad groups based on the catalytic metal loaded: wet impregnation, hydrolysis impregnation and chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Carbon nanotubes as supports =Properties= Schematic of CNT-supported catalyst Many textbooks describe carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in easily understood terms: carbon nanotubes are tubular structures made entirely of rolled-up layers of graphene. The diameters of CNTs ranges from about one nanometer to tens of nanometers, while their lengths can be up to centimeters, much greater than the diameters. In general, the hollow geometry of CNTs leads to large specific surface areas, which makes CNTs extremely attractive supports for heterogeneous catalysts. Another advantage of CNTs is their relatively high oxidation stability which is induced by their structural integrity and chemical inertness. Additionally, CNTs have exceptional physical properties including electrical conductivity, mechanical strength and thermal conductivity, which are important factors for catalyst supports. CNTs can be either metallic or semiconductive, depending on their helicity and diameter, and this property can greatly affect charge transfer processes. CNTs possess a very large Young's modulus, as well as a great tensile strength, and their flexibility property makes them an ideal component for applications in composite materials. CNTs also have good thermal conductivity, which helps to prevent the agglomeration and growth of small nanoparticles during postannealing treatments, and stabilize newly formed phases. In summary, CNTs are tough and tensile, owning good electron conductivity and chemical inertness, as well as thermal conductivity. Therefore, they become ideal and unique templates for nanoparticle immobilization, which allows the construction of designed nanoarchitectures. This makes CNTs extremely attractive supports for heterogeneous catalysts and related technologies. =Preparation of carbon nanotubes= CNTs are generally produced by four main techniques: arc discharge, laser ablation, molten salt intercalation, and chemical vapor deposition. Since as-produced CNTs usually contain a variety of impurities such as graphene fragments, amorphous carbon, fullerenes and metal catalyst particles. Since the impurities interfere with most of our desired properties and influence biocompatibility of CNTs, impairing the catalytical performance and limiting the application, they need to be purified and separated. CNTs need to be functionalized with different groups before being used in hybrid materials based on their purpose as well. Furthermore, in many applications we require uniform and stable dispersions of CNTs, but pristine single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs) are insoluble in most solvents, leading to aggregation between individual tubes. We also want to separate CNTs based on whether they are semiconducting or metallic. The production of CNTs has become easier and cheaper by the years, and the quality of as-prepared CNTs has improved since the contaminated impurities are considered. As a result, the major challenge is to develop cheap and facile methods to improve the uniformity in lengths, diameters and chirality of CNTs. CNTs has great potential as an important bridge connecting the molecular realm and the macroscopic world. =Characterization= The characterization techniques of CNTs supported catalysts are varied. The most common methods include X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), near-infrared spectroscopy, UV absorption spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy and fluorescence microscopy. These techniques and methodologies have been employed to not only comprehensively characterize CNT–nanocrystal heterostructures, but also thoroughly investigate the properties of these hybrid materials. Preparation To obtain a CNTs supported catalyst, the first step is to load the catalytic materials onto CNTs. A variety of synthesis strategies for the CNT/metal nanoparticle hybrids can be classified as ex situ and in situ techniques. =Ex situ approaches= Ex situ approaches utilize different interactions including covalent interactions, noncovalent interactions, π-π stacking and electrostatic interactions. Covalent interactions are used to attach inorganic nanoparticles with various function group terminals to CNTs treated by acids. One typical example is amide bond. Because of the excellent biological compatibility of Au, they are so frequently used in biosensing, medical and other related fields. Au nanoparticles have been linked to acid treated CNTs by aminothiols, bifunctional thiols or thioether bonds. Hydrophilic metal oxides such as MnO2, MgO, TiO2 and Zr(SO4)2 can be directly attached to the carboxyl groups, averting the use and separation of linking agent. On the other hand, however, the interactions are relatively weak, and the distribution of the nanoparticles are not as uniform. Besides covalent bonds, the linkage between catalytic particles and pure CNTs can also be achieved by noncovalent interactions such as van der Waals interactions, hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, and electrostatic interactions. The surfactant sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) is widely used to attach diverse nanoparticles including Pt, EuF3, TbF3 and SiO2 to multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). In another approach which utilizes hydrophobic capping agents, for instance, octanethiols and dodecanethiols, both coverage and morphology of the hybrid materials can be well controlled by modifying the length and functional groups of the chains. A similar route is to make use of the delocalized π electrons of CNTs as well as those in aromatic organic compounds containing polar group terminated alkyl chains. The most distinguished advantage of this method is that pyrene compounds are absorpted on CNTs, which improves the solubility of CNTs, together with dispersibility and charge transfer ability of loaded nanoparticles. In another simple and facile approach where electrostatic interactions are utilized, ionic polyelectrolytes are deposited on CNTs so as to attract charged nanoparticles. =In situ approaches= In situ approaches are alternatives for ex situ approaches with a better control of particle dispersion. Inorganic compounds are directly formed on the surface of CNTs via a variety of techniques including electrochemical techniques, sol-gel process, hydrothermal and aerosol techniques and gas-phase deposition. Electrochemistry is a method that controls the nucleation and growth process of noble metals and alloys efficaciously. Metal complexes in solutions can be reduced by electrons provided on electrodes to form metal nanoparticles, and the size of the metal nanoparticles and their coverage on the sidewalls of CNTs can be controlled by changing electrochemical deposition parameters such as deposition time and nucleation potential. Sol-gel process is a commonly used solution-based process which can produce glass and ceramic materials of different shapes. In this process, the reactants (usually metal salts or metal organic compounds) go through a series of hydrolysis and condensation reactions and form colloidal or polymeric sols, followed by an aging process to convert the sols into gels. Then gels are then desiccated drying under supercritical conditions and converted into aerogel. This is a cheap technique avoiding the requirement of high temperature, enabling fine controls in chemical composition as well as lowest concentration of dopants. But it also shows the weakness that the product will typically contain an amorphous phase, thus crystallization and postannealing steps are required and increase the complexity of preparation. Hydrothermal techniques are developed in recent years. The advantage of this method is to get crystalline particles or films without postannealing and calcinations. Formation of inorganic nanowires and nanorods can also be achieved by the forced crystallization in hydrothermal process. In addition, various gas-phase deposition methods are used to load inorganic catalytical particles onto CNTs surface. Among the most commonly used gas-phase deposition methods, chemical and physical vapor depositions enjoy an advantage in excellent control over the size, shape and uniformity. Thin and continuous films can be deposited on carbon substrates, retaining the 3D integrity. Other physical techniques such as sputtering and pulsed laser deposition (PLD), together with chemical methods (for instance, atomic layer deposition (ALD)), are good alternatives to deposit desired particles on CNTs. =Limitations= One general difficulty to deposit catalytic metal or metal oxides on CNTs is to control the size and distribution of the particles. Many of these preparations suffer from deposition scarcity, unwanted large size or aggregates of catalyst particles even at a relatively low loading content. On the other hand, in order to decorate CNTs with catalytic particles, a functionalization process is generally required beforehand: this makes the preparation more complex and increases the cost. In addition, after attaching functional groups on CNTs, the properties of CNTs are usually affected, and the performance of as-prepared hybrid material will be impaired as a result. For these reasons, more facile preparation methods with less impact on the properties of CNTs need to be developed. Applications Although at an early stage of research, CNTs supported metal-nanoparticle catalysts as transition metals Ru, Co, Ag, Pt, Pd, and Au shed new light to catalysis reactions in many fields such as batteries, flat panel displays, and chemical sensors. In organic synthesis like Heck reaction or Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, CNTs supported Pd or Co catalysts are applied to improve catalytic activity or to optimize experimental conditions. For the selective catalytic reduction of NOx with hydrocarbons, CNTs supported Pt–Rh catalyst displays higher NOx reduction activity. Particularly, with hydrogen carbon-based fuel reserves rapidly running out, fuel cell and battery with application of CNTs-supported metal nanoparticles catalysts have been an active area of research. For example, catalytic hydrogenation of to produce methanol has been considered as one of the most economical and effective ways to chemically fix huge amount of emitted CO2 and also to improve climate conditions. CNTs supported Pd catalyst has considerable activity and selectivity, which is favored in hydrogenation of CO2. However, to realize these applications from laboratory devices to industrial prototypes, further optimization is needed. Many challenges remain such as the control of the interface and the morphology, phase composition of the catalysts, and the type and quality of CNTs. Reproducibility problem can not be ignored, and a better understanding of the relationship between structures and properties is also in need. =Carbon nanotube-supported Pd catalyst= In the catalysts of Heck reaction, precious metal Pd was the most used active component. Supported Pd catalysts displayed many advantages. Compared with the traditional homogeneous Pd(OAc)2, PdCl2 catalysts in Heck reaction, CNTs-supported Pd catalyst has higher catalytic activity, better stability, easier separation and more satisfactory reusability. In experimental process, carbon nanotube supported Pd catalysts were prepared using chemical reduction. Additional chemical reductant is used to solve the agglomeration of Pd nanoparticles. Figure 2. Heck arylation catalyzed by the CNT supported palladium catalyst =Carbon nanotube-supported Pd-metal catalyst= Formic acid is a non-toxic and non-explosive liquid at room temperature. It has low toxicity, facility of storage, handling and primarily high energy density. such advantages are favored for potential applications in small portable fuel cell. Carbon supported Pd catalysts have played a very important role in DFAFC (direct formic acid fuel cell) catalyst research in recent years due to their good activity as well as more efficient Pd metal utilization and lower metal loadings. The mechanism of formic acid electrooxidation on Pt and Pt-group metal surfaces selection in acid solution follows the dual pathways: dehydrogenation and dehydration. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) have higher nanoparticle dispersion as the support of the cathode electrocatalyst. Therefore, it showed a better performance than that electrocatalysts supported on carbon black in DEFCs (direct ethanol fuel cells). =Carbon nanotube-supported Pd-metal-oxide catalyst= Hydrogenation of CO2 has been considered as one of the most economical and effective ways in fixing huge amount of emitted CO2. Supported Pd-metal-oxide catalysts have been found to show considerable activity and selectivity for hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol, and the supporter has significant effect on the performance of the catalyst. MWCNT-supported Pd–ZnO catalysts for hydrogenation of carbon dioxideto methanol played dual roles as a catalyst supporter and a promoter. Greater amount of hydrogen can be absorbed to generate a micro-environment with higher the concentration of active H-adspecies at the surface of the functioning catalyst, thus increasing the rate of surface hydrogenation reactions. =Carbon nanotubes supported Pt catalyst= Direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFC) and direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC) are highly efficient, pollution-free and noiseless energy conversion systems that can produce electricity through electrochemical reactions. They are expected to be useful as a power source for portable electronic devices including laptop computers, cell-phones, and so on. The activity of electrocatalysts play a key role in the commercialization of DMFC or DEFC. Among the many electrocatalysts, Pt enjoys high electrocatalytic efficiency and has been proved to be the most effective catalysts for alcohol oxidation reactions. Bimetallic catalysts including Pt and a second precious or non-precious metal (like Ru, Rh, Sn, Pb, Sb, Ni, etc.) are often applied to enhance the electrochemical activity of Pr and at the same time avoiding its deactivation when exposed to poisoning intermediates by the byfunctional or ligand mechanisms. As a kind of electrocatalyst support, CNTs have shown better corrosion-resistance than other catalyst supports such as carbon black under operational conditions. Besides, CNTs not only enjoy a highly electrochemically accessible surface area but can also offer a remarkable electronic conductivity due to its multi- wall structure, which properties render it a competitive electrocatalyst support for Pt-catalyst. It has been found that the electrochemical activity of different Pt-catalysts follows the order of Pt-WO3/CNT > Pt-Ru/E-TEK-Vulcan > Pt/CNT > Pt/E-TEK-Vulcan > bulk platinum. The reason why CNT based materials have higher electrochemical response is most probably due to its higher surface area that are electroactive. =Carbon nanotubes supported Co nanoparticles catalyst= The Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (FTS) process needs to be catalyzed by certain transition metals as Co, Fe, and Ru which present the highest activity. Among them, Co catalysts are preferred because of their high activity and selectivity to linear hydrocarbons for FTS, more stable, and low cost compared to Ru. Activated carbon has many advantages, such as resistance to acidic or basic media, stable at high temperatures, etc., serving as FTS catalyst support. Using carbon nanotubes as Co catalyst support was found to decrease the temperature of cobalt oxide species. The strong metal-support interactions are reduced greatly and the reducibility of the catalysts improved significantly. CNTs help to increase the dispersion of metal clusters and thus decreasing the average cobalt clusters size. Research showed that the hydrocarbon yield obtained by inventive CNTs supported Co catalyst is considerably larger than that obtained from Co on alumina supports.

It is the seat of the Diocese of Gaylord. History The original cathedral The parish began as a mission in the Diocese of Grand Rapids. The first church was constructed in 1884, and with a predominately Polish congregation, the parish began to grow. During the pastorate of the Rev. Casmir Skory, St. Mary's School was founded in 1893 with Dominican Sisters as teachers. Also during his pastorate a new church was built from 1900 to 1901 for about $15,000. For many years it was the largest building in the area. When Pope Paul VI established the Diocese of Gaylord on December 19, 1970, St. Mary’s became the cathedral for the new diocese. The first bishop of Gaylord, Edmund Szoka, had the present cathedral built. The cornerstone was laid on July 25, 1975. The new cathedral was dedicated to Our Lady of Mount Carmel on June 25, 1976. The bell tower and bells were consecrated in July 1977. A local group bought the old church in 1985 and converted it into a performing arts center named the Mount Carmel Centre. Architecture St. Mary’s Cathedral is an octagon-shaped structure built in the Modern architectural style. A statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary outside the south entrance was created by Jim Hopfensperger of Midland, Michigan. It is cast in bronze and was added to the grounds in 1991. A gathering space provides the entryway into the building. The baptismal font is an octagon shaped pool near the entrance. The altar is created from Vermont granite. Inside the altar are the relics of the evangelists St. Matthew, St. Mark and St. Luke, a piece of St. John's house, and pieces of bone from other saints. The pipe organ was built by the Gabriel Kney Company of London, Ontario, Canada. The 2,000 plus pipes were manufactured in Göttingen, Germany. The Blessed Sacrament Chapel contains a sculpture of The Burning Bush by Vera Bartnik of Traverse City, Michigan. The tabernacle is in the shape of a monstrance and has a luna suspended in a sunburst where the Eucharist is reserved. There are four shrine areas in the cathedral dedicated to the Sacred Heart, St. Joseph, Our Lady of Czestochowa and Bishop Frederic Baraga. The stained glass windows portray the Litany of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and the Stations of the Cross are bronze bas reliefs. Four crosses with candles mark the four primary directions where the cathedral walls were consecrated with Sacred Chrism. File:Our Lady of Mt. Carmel-Gaylord.jpg File:Our Lady of Mt.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places listings in McCulloch County, Texas in 1977, and became a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 1967. History This is the second courthouse to serve McCulloch County. The first county building was erected in 1879. The current courthouse was completed in 1900, and the datestone was laid by the Brady Lodge of the Freemasons on September 29, 1899. Martin & Moodie of Comanche are listed as the builders, with no separate name for an architect. When the decision was made in 1899 to erect a new courthouse, Martin & Moodie submitted their proposal and were awarded the contract. The new three-story sandstone courthouse was in the Richardson Romanesque style, and bears some semblance to the style of architect James Riely Gordon. While the clock tower has areas designed for a clock on each of the four sides, no clock is installed. The courthouse underwent a renovation in 2009, part of which gave the structure a red roof. In both 1936 and 1938, Brady Creek (San Saba River) overflowed its banks and caused flooding in and around the courthouse. Heart of Texas monument In 1963, the Texas Historical Commission designated the geographical center of Texas as being located northwest of Brady. On the courthouse grounds is a Heart of Texas granite marker designed by Earl V. Finlay. The actual carving and inscription were done in 1958 by Brady native son Gary Bryson. Funding for the monument was provided by the Brady Chamber of Commerce and the McCulloch County Commissioners' Court.

One of the first 5 faculties of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki was the Faculty of Law and Economics consisting of two departments, Law Department and Economics and Political Science Department. A special committee took place (composed of Professors A. Andreades, K. Varvaressos, S. Seferiades and C. Sfiris) in order to elect the first professors of the Law school; Periklis Vizoukides (who was the first Dean of the faculty and afterwards rector of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki), Professor of Civil Law, Xenophon Zolotas Politic Economy professor, Jean Spiropoulos Professor of International Law, Dimosthenis Stefanides Politic Economy professor and Thrasivoulos Haralambides Professor of Commercial law. Lately in '00s, Faculty of Law and Economics was expanded with Political Science department and hence was renamed into Faculty of Law, Economics and Political Science. In 1962 the graduate program (the first LLM in Greece) of the law school began its operation. Law school takes part in many international law competitions such as Ph. Jessup Moot Court International competition. In this competition, Law School of Thessaloniki in 2005 came 1st among 600 universities from all over the world (in the writing part of the competition), 5th in 2001, 4th in 2004 (in the writing part of the competition), 6th in 2007 and 5th in 2008, 3rd in 2009.
