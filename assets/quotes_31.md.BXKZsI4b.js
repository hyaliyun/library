It is now a part of the Murugappa Group.  History  Col. R. E. B. Crompton founded R.E.B. Crompton & Company in 1878. The company was merged with F.A. Parkinson in 1927 to form Crompton Parkinson Ltd. Greaves Cotton and Company, established by James Greaves in 1859, was appointed as their concessionaire in India. In 1937, Crompton Parkinson established Crompton Parkinson Works Ltd. in Bombay as a wholly owned Indian subsidiary. In collaboration with Greaves Cotton, it also established a sales organisation, Greaves Cotton & Crompton Parkinson Ltd. In 1947, just before India's independence, Lala Karam Chand Thapar, an Indian industrialist, bought Greaves Cotton when the company was put up for sale. With this acquisition, Karam Chand Thapar gained control of several associated companies such as Crompton Parkison Works, Greaves Cotton and Crompton Parkinson Company. The name Crompton Greaves Limited was adopted on 2 August 1966, following a court-directed amalgamation of Greaves Cotton and Crompton Parkinson Ltd. Over the years, the company has evolved into one of India's largest private sector enterprises. In 1974, Crompton Greaves signed a Western Hemisphere exclusive with CEO H.W. (Hub) Markwardt of Fort Worth, Texas based Encon Industries to begin exporting their highly efficient high-breeze electric ceiling fans to the American market. Over the next 10 years, Crompton Greaves would export over 6 million units of ceiling fans to Markwardt in North & South America primarily for residential use under the brand name \\"Encon\\", which stood for ENergy CONservation. After the acquisition of the Belgium-based Pauwels Trafo/Pauwels Group in May 2005, Crompton Greaves was ranked amongst the world's top ten electrical transformer manufacturers. The company subsequently acquired companies outside India. These include Ganz (Hungary), Microsol (Ireland), Sonomatra (France), MSE Power Systems (USA), and ZIV (Spain). Crompton Greaves is a part of the 4 billion Murugappa Group, and is headquartered in a building CG House at Worli, Mumbai. In 2009 Crompton Greaves adopted a new brand identity and is since known as CG. Crompton Greaves made series of acquisitions overseas which included\\\\- ZIV Group for Euro 150 Mn, QEI Inc, provider of SCADA and automation systems for $30.0 Mn and Emotron Group, a power electronics and engineering company, for $82.3 Mn (57.8 Mn Euros). In September 2012, HSBC Global Investment Funds raised its stake in Crompton Greaves from 1.29% to 2.68% through bulk deal on BSE for ‚Çπ927.3 million. In March 2009, Crompton Greaves acquired 41% stake in Avantha Power & Infrastructure Limited for ‚Çπ2.27 billion. CG has delivered transformer equipment to the Danish Anholt Offshore Wind Farm, and is scheduled to deliver 6 transformers for the Kriegers Flak offshore windfarm.http://energiwatch.dk/secure/Energinyt/Renewables/article8361901.ece Products & Services *MV Switchgear **VCB, PCVCB, GIS & RMUhttp://www.cgglobal.com/frontend/Crompton.aspx?cnl1=KV1SpKMjSGM= Nagpur office Address: CG Power & Industrial Solution Ltd., 2nd Floor, Sai Niwas, Narendra Nagar, Square Ring Road, Nagpur - 440015  Awards  * Received NABL Accreditation for 5 of its labs & 1 calibration lab.http://www.cgglobal.com/frontend/finalnonproduct.aspx?cnl2=3G3ss5YkJ3g= References External links *Crompton Greaves Global *Crompton Pump Category:Companies established in 1878 Category:Companies based in Mumbai Category:Electrical engineering companies of India Category:Companies listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange ","title":"CG Power and Industrial Solutions"},{"id":"4813666","text":"John P.

Guy Lambton Menzies (20 August 1909AustLit. retrieved 23 February 20141 November 1940) was an Australian aviator who flew the first solo trans-Tasman flight, from Sydney, Australia to the West Coast of New Zealand, on 7 January 1931. The first crossing of the Tasman by air had been achieved on 10‚Äì11 September 1928 by Charles Kingsford Smith and Charles Ulm in the Southern Cross. The plane Menzies used for his solo crossing was the Avro Sports Avian that Smith had flown from England to Australia, the Southern Cross Junior. Fearing he might be denied permission for the flight, Menzies informed the authorities and his family that he was flying to Perth. Instead, he left Sydney at 1 am on 7 January 1931, and headed for Blenheim, New Zealand. Poor weather forced Menzies off course, and after 11 hours and 45 minutes he crash-landed upside-down in the La Fontaine Swamp near Hari Hari on New Zealand's West Coast. Despite the unfortunate landing, Menzies had broken Smith and Ulm's time by 2¬Ω hours. An extensive outdoor historical marker with photographs and descriptions is located at GPS coordinates -43.076716, 170.531477 (south latitude, east longitude). The marker is approximately 1/2 km southwest of the actual landing spot (now on private land), which is marked by a pole with wind sock that are visible from the historical marker. News clippings and additional historical details are on display in the lobby of the Hotel Hari Hari, a few km away on the main highway 6. During the Second World War, Menzies was a Squadron Leader in the Royal Air Force. He and his crew were killed on 1 November 1940, when his flying boat was shot down over the Mediterranean Sea while en route from Malta to Sicily. No remains of the aircraft or crew were ever found. He is commemorated at the Alamein Memorial in Egypt.Alamein Memorial On 7 January 2006, celebrations were held in Hari Hari to commemorate the 75th anniversary of Menzies' trans-Tasman voyage, and were marked by a re-enactment of the flight by adventurer Dick Smith.

They use the Earth's near constant subterranean temperature to warm or cool air or other fluids for residential, agricultural or industrial uses. If building air is blown through the heat exchanger for heat recovery ventilation, they are called earth tubes (also termed earth cooling tubes, earth warming tubes, earth-air heat exchangers (EAHE or EAHX), air-to-soil heat exchanger, earth channels, earth canals, earth-air tunnel systems, ground tube heat exchanger, hypocausts, subsoil heat exchangers, thermal labyrinths, underground air pipes, and others). Earth tubes are often a viable and economical alternative or supplement to conventional central heating or air conditioning systems since there are no compressors, chemicals or burners and only blowers are required to move the air. These are used for either partial or full cooling and/or heating of facility ventilation air. Their use can help buildings meet Passive House standards or LEED certification. Earth-air heat exchangers have been used in agricultural facilities (animal buildings) and horticultural facilities (greenhouses) in the United States of America over the past several decades and have been used in conjunction with solar chimneys in hot arid areas for thousands of years, probably beginning in the Persian Empire. Implementation of these systems in India as well as in the cooler climates of Austria, Denmark and Germany to preheat the air for home ventilation systems has become fairly common since the mid-1990s, and is slowly being adopted in North America. Ground-coupled heat exchanger may also use water or antifreeze as a heat transfer fluid, often in conjunction with a geothermal heat pump. See, for example downhole heat exchangers. The rest of this article deals primarily with earth-air heat exchangers or earth tubes. Design Heat recovery ventilation, often including an earth-to-air heat exchanger, is essential to achieve the German passivhaus standard Earth pipe before being covered with soil Earth-air heat exchangers can be analyzed for performance with several software applications using weather gage data. These software applications include GAEA, AWADUKT Thermo, EnergyPlus, L-EWTSim, WKM, and others. However, numerous earth-air heat exchanger systems have been designed and constructed improperly, and failed to meet design expectations. Earth-air heat exchangers appear best suited for air pretreatment rather than for full heating or cooling. Pretreatment of air for an air source heat pump or ground- source heat pump often provides the best economic return on investment, with simple payback often achieved within one year after installation. Most systems are usually constructed from diameter, smooth-walled (so they do not easily trap condensation moisture and mold), rigid or semi-rigid plastic, plastic- coated metal pipes or plastic pipes coated with inner antimicrobial layers, buried underground where the ambient earth temperature is typically all year round in the temperate latitudes where most humans live. Ground temperature becomes more stable with depth. Smaller diameter tubes require more energy to move the air and have less earth contact surface area. Larger tubes permit a slower airflow, which also yields more efficient energy transfer and permits much higher volumes to be transferred, permitting more air exchanges in a shorter time period, when, for example, you want to clear the building of objectionable odors or smoke but suffer from poorer heat transfer from the pipe wall to the air due to increased distances. Some consider that it is more efficient to pull air through a long tube than to push it with a fan. A solar chimney can use natural convection (warm air rising) to create a vacuum to draw filtered passive cooling tube air through the largest diameter cooling tubes. Natural convection may be slower than using a solar-powered fan. Sharp 90-degree angles should be avoided in the construction of the tube ‚Äì two 45-degree bends produce less-turbulent, more efficient air flow. While smooth- wall tubes are more efficient in moving the air, they are less efficient in transferring energy. There are three configurations, a closed loop design, an open 'fresh air' system or a combination: *Closed loop system: Air from inside the home or structure is blown through a U-shaped loop of typically of tube(s) where it is moderated to near earth temperature before returning to be distributed via ductwork throughout the home or structure. The closed loop system can be more effective cooling the air (during air temperature extremes) than an open system, since it cools and recools the same air. *Open system: Outside air is drawn from a filtered air intake (Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value MERV 8+ air filter is recommended) to cool or preheat the air. The tubes are typically long straight tubes into the home. An open system combined with energy recovery ventilation can be nearly as efficient (80-95%) as a closed loop, and ensures that entering fresh air is filtered and tempered. *Combination system: This can be constructed with dampers that allow either closed or open operation, depending on fresh air ventilation requirements. Such a design, even in closed loop mode, could draw a quantity of fresh air when an air pressure drop is created by a solar chimney, clothes dryer, fireplace, kitchen or bathroom exhaust vents. It is better to draw in filtered passive cooling tube air than unconditioned outside air. Single-pass earth air heat exchangers offer the potential for indoor air quality improvement over conventional systems by providing an increased supply of outdoor air. In some configurations of single-pass systems, a continuous supply of outdoor air is provided. This type of system would usually include one or more ventilation heat recovery units. =Thermal Labyrinths= A thermal labyrinth performs the same function as an earth tube, but they are usually formed from a larger volume rectilinear space, sometimes incorporated into building basements or under ground floors, and which are in turn divided by numerous internal walls to form a labyrinthine air path. Maximising the length of the air path ensures a better heat transfer effect. The construction of the labyrinth walls, floors, and dividing walls is normally of high thermal mass cast concrete and concrete block, with the exterior walls and floors in direct contact with the surrounding earth. Safety If humidity and associated mold colonization is not addressed in system design, occupants may face health risks. At some sites, the humidity in the earth tubes may be controlled simply by passive drainage if the water table is sufficiently deep and the soil has relatively high permeability. In situations where passive drainage is not feasible or needs to be augmented for further moisture reduction, active (dehumidifier) or passive (desiccant) systems may treat the air stream. Formal research indicates that earth-air heat exchangers reduce building ventilation air pollution. Rabindra (2004) states, ‚ÄúThe tunnel [earth-Air heat exchanger] is found not to support the growth of bacteria and fungi; rather it is found to reduce the quantity of bacteria and fungi thus making the air safer for humans to inhale. It is therefore clear that the use of EAT [Earth Air Tunnel] not only helps save the energy but also helps reduce the air pollution by reducing bacteria and fungi.‚Äù Likewise, Flueckiger (1999) in a study of twelve earth- air heat exchangers varying in design, pipe material, size and age, stated, ‚ÄúThis study was performed because of concerns of potential microbial growth in the buried pipes of ground-coupled air systems. The results however demonstrate, that no harmful growth occurs and that the airborne concentrations of viable spores and bacteria, with few exceptions, even decreases after passage through the pipe-system‚Äù, and further stated, ‚ÄúBased on these investigations the operation of ground-coupled earth-to-air heat exchangers is acceptable as long as regular controls are undertaken and if appropriate cleaning facilities are available‚Äù. Measurement, Modeling and Simulation of an Earth-to-Air Heat Exchanger in Marburg (Germany) , Rainer Wagner, Stefan Beisel, Astrid Spieler, Klaus Vajen Philipps-Universit√§t Marburg, Department of Physics (2000) Whether using earth tubes with or without antimicrobial material, it is extremely important that the underground cooling tubes have an excellent condensation drain and be installed at a 2-3 degree grade to ensure the constant removal of condensed water from the tubes. When implementing in a house without a basement on a flat lot, an external condensation tower can be installed at a depth lower than where the tube enters into the house and at a point close to the wall entry. The condensation tower installation requires the added use of a condensate pump in which to remove the water from the tower. For installations in houses with basements, the pipes are graded so that the condensation drain located within the house is at the lowest point. In either installation, the tube must continually slope towards either the condensation tower or the condensation drain. The inner surface of the tube, including all joints must be smooth to aid in the flow and removal of condensate. Corrugated or ribbed tubes and rough interior joints must not be used. Joints connecting the tubes together must be tight enough to prevent water or gas infiltration. In certain geographic areas, it is important that the joints prevent Radon gas infiltration. Porous materials like uncoated concrete tubes cannot be used. Ideally, Earth Tubes with antimicrobial inner layers should be used in installations to inhibit the potential growth of molds and bacteria within the tubes. Effectiveness Implementations of earth-air heat exchangers for either partial or full cooling and/or heating of facility ventilation air have had mixed success. The literature is, unfortunately, well populated with over-generalizations about the applicability of these systems ‚Äì both in favor for, and against. A key aspect of earth-air heat exchangers is the passive nature of operation and consideration of the wide variability of conditions in natural systems. Earth- air heat exchangers can be very cost effective in both up-front/capital costs as well as long-term operation and maintenance costs. However, this varies widely depending on the location‚Äôs latitude, altitude, ambient Earth temperature, climatic temperature-and-relative-humidity extremes, solar radiation, water table, soil type (thermal conductivity), soil moisture content and the efficiency of the building's exterior envelope design / insulation. Generally, dry-and-low-density soil with little or no ground shade will yield the least benefit, while dense damp soil with considerable shade should perform well. A slow drip watering system may improve thermal performance. Damp soil in contact with the cooling tube conducts heat more efficiently than dry soil. Earth cooling tubes are much less effective in hot humid climates (like Florida) where the ambient temperature of the earth approaches human comfort temperature. The higher the ambient temperature of the earth, the less effective it is for cooling and dehumidification. However, the earth can be used to partially cool and dehumidify the replacement fresh air intake for passive-solar thermal buffer zone areas like the laundry room, or a solarium / greenhouse, especially those with a hot tub, swim spa, or indoor swimming pool, where warm humid air is exhausted in the summer, and a supply of cooler drier replacement air is desired. Not all regions and sites are suitable for earth-air heat exchangers. Conditions which may hinder or preclude proper implementation include shallow bedrock, high water table, and insufficient space, among others. In some areas, only cooling or heating may be afforded by earth-air heat exchangers. In these areas, provision for thermal recharge of the ground must especially be considered. In dual function systems (both heating and cooling), the warm season provides ground thermal recharge for the cool season and the cool season provides ground thermal recharge for the warm season, though overtaxing the thermal reservoir must be considered even with dual function systems. Renata Limited, a prominent pharmaceutical company in Bangladesh, tried out a pilot project trying to find out whether they could use the Earth Air Tunnel technology to complement the conventional air conditioning system. Concrete pipes with a total length 60 feet (~18¬ºm), inner diameter 9 inches (~23 cm), outer diameter 11 inches (~28 cm) were placed at a depth of 9 feet (~2¬æm) underground and a blower of 1.5 kW rated power was employed. The underground temperature at that depth was found to be around 28 ¬∞C. The mean velocity of air in the tunnel was about 5 m/s. The coefficient of performance (COP) of the underground heat exchanger thus designed was poor ranging from 1.5‚Äì3. The results convinced the authorities that in hot and humid climates, it is unwise to implement the concept of Earth-Air heat exchanger. The cooling medium (earth itself) being at a temperature approaching that of the ambient environment happens to be the root cause of the failure of such principles in hot, humid areas (parts of Southeast Asia, Florida in the U.S. etc.). However, investigators from places like Britain and Turkey have reported very encouraging COPs-well above 20. The underground temperature seems to be of prime importance when planning an Earth-Air heat exchanger. Environmental impact In the context of today's diminishing fossil fuel reserves, increasing electrical costs, air pollution and global warming, properly designed earth cooling tubes offer a sustainable alternative to reduce or eliminate the need for conventional compressor-based air conditioning systems, in non-tropical climates. They also provide the added benefit of controlled, filtered, temperate fresh air intake, which is especially valuable in tight, well-weatherized, efficient building envelopes. Water to earth An alternative to the earth-to-air heat exchanger is the \\"water\\" to earth heat exchanger. This is typically similar to a geothermal heat pump tubing embedded horizontally in the soil (or could be a vertical sonde) to a similar depth of the earth-air heat exchanger. It uses approximately double the length of pipe of 35 mm diameter, e.g., around 80 m compared to an EAHX of 40 m. A heat exchanger coil is placed before the air inlet of the heat recovery ventilator. Typically a brine liquid (heavily salted water) is used as the heat exchanger fluid. Many European installations are now using this setup due to the ease of installation. No fall or drainage point is required and it is safe because of the reduced risk from mold.

The game was released on May 9, 2006 on Microsoft Windows and the PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, and Game Boy Advance platforms, alongside a separate handheld version for the Nintendo DS. Sami Kirkpatrick, Madison Davenport and Shane Baumel reprise their roles from the film as baby porcupines Bucky, Quillo, and Spike. Story In the video game, which takes place a year after the movie, RJ, Hammy, Verne, and the gang feel that they need to have more things for the log (the area behind the hedge). This leads them on a wild romp through six different areas to snatch different things such as a popcorn machine and a TV for themselves. There are several mini games as bonuses in the game. All through the game, they try to take these things while avoiding the Sniffer, (Dwayne the Verminator), who tries to defeat them by using mind-controlled vermin he has captured as his \\"henchmen.\\" At one point, many animals, including weasels, badgers, and even Vincent the bear are controlled. Gameplay Over the Hedge features 3D platform gameplay as well as mini games. Players navigate a series of homes searching for luxury items, controlling RJ, Verne, Hammy or Stella. Character voices are provided by soundalikes rather than the original actors who recorded the voices for the film (except Bucky, Spike and Quillo). Two different kinds of attack can be employed, melee and ranged. Your arsenal includes golf clubs, sticks, baseball bats, plungers and other various items to use as improvised weapons. Ranged attacks consist of throwing boomerangs, frisbees and shooting golf balls, and these attacks can be charged up. There are also energy attacks, projectile weapons and objects to pick up and throw at enemies. The game has several pickup weapons, such as weapons that only opponents have (i.e., a trowel). There are also guns that can be picked up, such as a toy ball launcher, a freeze ray, a bubble shooter, or a lava blaster. Players can jump or double jump. The game allows a second player to press a button on the second controller and join the game at any time, as well as pause the game and drop out. There are also plenty of obstacles and hazards to overcome, as well as objectives to complete and extras to collect. The game also has an array of hats, which when collected make a humorous sound and act as armor. These include a chef hat, a crown, a witch hat and a hockey helmet amongst others. Several locations from the movie (and some that are not) appear to give a greater playing ground than the suburbs, the home base being the woods where all the loot is stored. Players can switch around between the four characters to give the storyline some slight twist, as each character says something different when a situation arises, to slightly alter the story. Reception Over the Hedge received \\"generally unfavorable\\" and \\"mixed or average\\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic.

In June 1710, the Bourbon- Spanish army of Phillip V crossed into Catalonia in an attempt to capture Balaguer; an Allied force of British, Portuguese, Dutch and Austrian troops supporting Archduke Charles countered these moves and the two armies met in battle just to the north of Lleida on the afternoon of 27 July. Philip's army was defeated and forced to withdraw behind the Ebro but remained intact.  Prelude  By the spring of 1709, France was financially exhausted, the severe winter of 1708/09 led to widespread famine and Louis XIV was forced to withdraw French troops from Spain to reinforce his northern frontier. However, although the Battle of Malplaquet in September 1709 was technically an Allied victory, the casualties shocked Europe and halted their advance into France. In Spain, forces loyal to the Bourbon candidate Philip V recaptured Alicante in April 1709 and won a resounding victory over an Anglo-Portuguese army at La Gudi√±a in May. The Portuguese now declared an informal truce, allowing trade and agriculture to recommence. All sides wanted peace but negotiations in The Hague over the winter and spring of 1709/10 failed when the Allies demanded Louis agree to remove his grandson Philip by force if necessary. This approach was summarised by the British Whig party slogan No Peace Without Spain but was a major miscalculation. There was growing opposition to the war in Britain, now the major financial backer of the Alliance while the campaign in Spain had largely been a failure. Phillip was far more popular with the Spanish than his rival Archduke Charles and so the war continued. In May 1710, Phillip and the Spanish-Bourbon army under Villadarias crossed the Segre river into Catalonia hoping to capture Balaguer. The first attempt failed due to torrential rain but French reinforcements increased the Spanish army to 20,000 infantry and 6,000 cavalry and in June they tried again. The illness of the Allied commander Starhemberg enabled Philip to capture a number of small towns but after several weeks of marching and counter-marching, on 27 July Stanhope's division crossed the Segres at Alfarr√†s and combined with Starhemberg's forces on the heights of Almenar.  The battle  Villadarias opened the battle with a cavalry attack on the Allied defences which initially gave way. The Spanish wasted the opening by pursuing groups of fleeing enemies and allowed the Allied lines to reform. British infantry and dragoons on the Allied left led by Stanhope and George Carpenter attacked the Bourbon army's right wing which fled, taking the second line with it; British casualties included the Earl of Rochford, Colonel of the 3rd Dragoon Regiment who was killed as they broke the Spanish lines. The Austrians simultaneously attacked and destroyed the Bourbon right wing, Philip himself only just avoiding capture. The battle took place late in the afternoon, preventing the Allies from following up their victory and allowing the Bourbon forces to gather their scattered cavalry and reassemble in the town of Zaragoza or Saragossa.  Aftermath  Shortly after this, Villadarias was replaced by the French general the Marquis de Bay, victor over an Anglo-Portuguese army at the Battle of La Gudina in May 1709. The Bourbon army was battered but largely intact. References Sources * Falkner, James The War of the Spanish Succession; (Pen and Sword, 2015); * Lynn, John A. The Wars of Louis XIV, 1667‚Äì1714.

The Ohuokhai dance. Halay is a regional category of folk dance styles in central and southeastern Anatolia. The music accompanying the dance is the zurna and davul. It begins slow and speeds up. The word Halay is derived from the words hilayi or halayi, which is in the Kurmanji dialect of Kurdish, meaning \\"standing up, playing\\". This Kurdish word is derived from the verb \\"hildan\\" or \\"haldan\\" in Kurdish. Halay is a traditional dance in Middle East it mostly played during wedding on the zurna, supported by a davul, but in the recent years, electronic instruments have started to replace them. Typically, Halay dancers form a circle or a line, while holding each other with the little finger or shoulder to shoulder or even hand to hand with the last and first player holding a piece of cloth. The Ohuokhai is a simultaneous round dance and song. Dancers form a circle and dance, arm in arm, hand in hand, with the left foot put forward, while making rhythmical, graceful movements with their bodies, legs, feet and arms. A lead singer improvises the lyrics and the other dancers repeat them. This Ohuokhai leader has a special talent not only for singing but also, what is more important, for poetic improvisation.

In the '80s, '90s and particularly in the early 2000s it was understood in a wider sense, as a synonym for the Basque Patriotic (Abertzale) Left, which pursues the same political goals to ETA, namely Basque independence and a socialist state. A narrower definition comprises ETA and those social and political organizations which are subservient or under the political influence of this organization. The narrower definition would exclude recently founded legal parties such as Amaiur, Bildu and Sortu which have renounced ETA's methods and publicly distanced themselves from this organization. These parties have filled the void left by political parties Herri Batasuna and Euskal Herritarrok among others, when they were included in the United States' list of terrorist organizations and formally dissolved by the Spanish Supreme Court in 2003. As a result, for much of the 2000s, the Abertzale left was left without political representation and it was during this period when the wider definition of MNLV was most applicable. The bulk of MLNV's constituency, political and social leaders have transitioned to the aforementioned legal parties, only those remaining organizations and individuals supporting, collaborating or subservient to ETA would be presently considered to belong to the MNLV. This is the case even though one of the Abertzale left's major causes is the rights of ETA prisoners, particularly their re-location to prisons to the Basque country. However, its political direction has been criticized by more hard-line members of this political space who demand a return to a more combative approach with the Spanish state. Some of the most relevant organizations that can be considered to have formed part of this political current are listed below.  Armed organizations  *ETA militarra *ETA politiko-militarra (disbanded in 1984), *Iparretarrak, active in France between 1973 and 2000, *Irrintzi, acting in the French Basque Country between 2006 and 2009, *Hordago, active in France in the 1980s, *Euskal Zuzentasuna, active in France between 1977 and 1979.

Founded in 1930, it was the first Basque nationalist political party to exist running on a socialist program. On 16 September 2008, the party was outlawed by the Spanish Supreme Court based on ties with ETA. The Spanish ruling was appealed to the European Court of Human Rights, which, after reviewing the question, upheld the Spanish courts on the matter. History It was formed in 1930, upon the reunification of the ultraconservative Aberri group and the moderate majority Comuni√≥n Nacionalista Vasca in the Basque Nationalist Party, by those who refused to support the traditional clerical ideology of the party. Its support was restricted to urban middle class and, as such, was a minority party. ANV played a minor role during the Republic, when it usually aligned with left and republican parties (being even part of the Popular Front in 1936) and in the Civil War. It was a part of the Basque Government in Exile from 1936 to 1979, and of the Spanish Republican government in Exile from 1938 until 1946, represented by a minister without portfolio, Tom√°s Bilbao. When democracy resumed in Spain, ANV run by itself for the first contemporary Spanish general election presenting candidates in Biscay and Gipuzkoa, achieving a meagre 0.64% of the total votes in the Basque country. During these years, ANV received compensation for the property seized after the war by the Francoist government. After the 1977 election, ANV chose not to run for elections by itself but run in subsequent elections as a minor part of the electoral platforms of the Basque National Liberation Movement. It was not a part of KAS though. Thus, when the Basque independentist party, Batasuna, was banned by the Spanish Supreme Court in 2002 after government allegations of its close relationship to ETA, EAE-ANV remained as a legal party. =Rise to prominence= nationalist bar in Bilbao showing banners urging people to vote for the EAE-ANV, 2007 Protests against the rejection of the EAE list for the municipal election at Leioa, 2007. The banning of Batasuna drew attention to the virtually unknown and inactive EAE-ANV as it was informally designated by Batasuna's ranks as the political heir of the illegalized Batasuna. Consequently, it was during the 2007 municipal and provincial Spanish elections when the new EAE-ANV received intensive media and political attention. Nearly half of its lists were declared illegal prior to the elections, because a significant portion of the candidates on them had previously run for either Batasuna, EH or HB (different reincarnations of the same base). This despite the fact those parties were legal when these candidates ran for them. The Supreme Court declared that those EAE-ANV lists were providing cover to an illegal party (Batasuna), and, therefore, those list including former Batasuna members were ineligible. Arguably in order to tamper the court assessment of its candidates, EAE-ANV only disclosed its intentions to run for those elections with the shortest possible legal notice. Thus, the legal assessment declaring some of the lists ineligible was made in a hurry, which also left little time (24 hours) for appeal on the part of the party. Some EAE-ANV members then claimed that a \\"presumption of guilt\\" was applied that remained to be properly proven in due time. Article in Spanish However, EAE-ANV could take part in the elections with its legal lists, and received a grand total of some 187,000 votes (those votes for lists declared ineligible prior to the elections were declared null). Among the illegal lists were those of Bilbao, San Sebasti√°n and Vitoria; but not those of Pamplona city council, where EAE-ANV has two representatives. =Current status= In February 2008, the Spanish government declared EAE-ANV illegal as a precautionary measure to prevent them from taking part in the Spanish general election, 2008 . This suspension was later on confirmed by the Spanish Supreme Court declaring EAE-ANV illegal. The case was taken by the defendants to the European Court of Human Rights, which upheld the Spanish court rulings stating that the EAE-ANV candidatures were, in effect, a \\"fraud\\" constructed to circumvent the previous outlawing of Batasuna.El Pais; Estrasburgo respalda la anulaci√≥n de las candidaturas de ANVJudgment of the European Court of Human Rights Despite the fact that the party was declared illegal, the court ruling was not retroactive, which meant that those elected members of EAE-ANV remained in their positions as city councilors until the next Spanish local election was held in 2011.

It generally includes areas east of Watling Street (which separates it from West Midlands English), north of an isogloss separating it from variants of Southern English (e.g. Oxfordshire) and the East Anglian English (e.g. Cambridgeshire) and south of the River Trent, which is often said to separate Midlands and Northern English dialects. (In this respect \\"northern English\\" includes the everyday speech of northern Derbyshire and north Nottinghamshire.) Thus East Midlands English includes southern Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, southern Nottinghamshire, Rutland and Northamptonshire. Relative to other English dialects, there have been relatively few studies of East Midlands English. Origins The Five Boroughs of the East Midlands distinct from the Kingdom of Mercia in the early 10th centuryFalkus & Gillingham and Hill. The Eastern English Midlands were incorporated in the Norse-controlled Danelaw in the late 9th century by Ivar the Boneless. With their conquest, the county towns of the East Midlands counties were converted into fortified, Viking city-states, known as the Five Boroughs of the Danelaw. The region's dialect owes much of its grammar and vocabulary to the Nordic influences of its conquerors. For example, the East Midlands verb to scraight ('to cry') is thought to be derived from the Norse, skrike in modern Scandinavian, also meaning to cry. The East Midlands dialect of Middle English which extended over a much larger area, as far south as Middlesex, is the precursor of modern English spoken today, which has descended from the early modern English of the early 16th century. East Midlands dialects in literature The romantic novelist and East Midlander D. H. Lawrence was from the Nottinghamshire town of Eastwood and wrote in the Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Coalfield dialects in several poems as well as in his more famous works such as Lady Chatterley's Lover and Sons and Lovers. Though spoken less commonly today, the dialect of the East Midlands has been investigated in texts such as the Ey Up Mi Duck series of books (and an LP) by Richard Scollins and John Titford. These books were originally intended as a study of Derbyshire Dialect, particularly the distinctive speech of Ilkeston and the Erewash valley, but later editions acknowledge similarities in vocabulary and grammar which unite the East Midlands dialects and broadened their appeal to the region as a whole. \\"Ey up\\" (often spelt ayup / eyup) is a greeting thought to be of Old Norse origin (se upp) used widely throughout the North Midlands, North Staffordshire and Yorkshire, and \\"m' duck\\" is thought to be derived from a respectful Anglo Saxon form of address, \\"Duka\\" (literally \\"duke\\"), and is unrelated to waterfowl. Non-natives of the East Midlands and North Staffordshire are often surprised to hear men greet each other as \\"m' duck\\". Grammar Those who speak traditional regional dialects are not trying unsuccessfully to speak Standard English. East Midlands English follows a series of distinct grammatical rules. Some examples follow below. =Formal address= Until the mid-20th century, it was not uncommon to hear the use of informal forms of address, thee and thou, as compared to the more formal you. Use of the informal form of address is now uncommon in modern speech. =Personal and possessive pronouns= Personal pronouns differ from standard English as follows: { cellspacing=\\"40\\"  ;yorn:yours ;mine:mine  ;theirn:theirs ;ourn:ours  ;hisn:his ;ern:hers } Example: It eent theirn; it's ourn! (It isn't theirs; it's ours!) =Reflexive pronouns= Reflexive pronouns are characterised by the replacement of \\"self\\" with sen (from Middle English seluen) * Y'usen ‚Äì Yourself * Mesen ‚Äì Myself * Thisens ‚Äì Themselves/Yourselves * Ussens ‚Äì Ourselves Example: We sh'll ay to do it ussens. (We shall have to do it ourselves.) Vocabulary Humorous texts, such as Nottingham As it is Spoke, have used their phonetically spelled words to deliberately confuse non- natives of the region. ;Alrate youth?:Are you alright young man? Here, is a spelling designed to convey the phonological specification in the traditional dialect of , which is , and a slight diphthonging of . ;Avya gorra wi'ya?:Is the wife with you? (lit. \\"Have you got her with you?) The pronunciation with weak form is alleged to be more common in Nottingham and the South East Midlands; pronunciations with th-fronting in are alleged to be more common elsewhere. TH-fronting became a potential feature of the accents of the region in around 1960. The humorous spellings are designed to indicate H-dropping, the ‚Äô‚ÄôNorthern T-to-R rule‚Äô‚Äô and , the non-Standard weakform of , which is common to many dialects in England. ;'as any onya any onya? : Here is an example of Belper, Derbyshire dialect when asking a group of people if any of them have any matches with which to light a pipe. Has any of you, got any (matches) on you? ;It's black ovver Bill's mother's:It looks like rain. (lit. \\"It's black over Bill's Mother's.\\") ‚Äì a common, if somewhat old-fashioned, Midlands expression implying impending bad weather. The spelling chosen to indicate the phonological specification in the traditional dialect of : . Derived from Kaiser Bill ;Awont gunta worra:I wasn't going to, was I? , and are blend words designed to convey the phonological specification in the traditional dialect of , and . ;A fund im in cut:I found him in the Canal, (lit. \\"I found him in the cut). Using the traditional and local word for Canal. Canals were originally referred to as \\"Cuts\\" because during the industrial revolution canals or highways for transportation of goods were literally \\"cut\\" into the landscape and allowed to fill with water. ;Thez summat up wiv im:I think he may be ill. (lit. \\"There's something up with him.\\"). The spellings here chosen to indicate the ‚Äò‚ÄòNorthern‚Äô‚Äô feature that is a monophthong, the non-Standard English word , which is historically found in many dialects across England (cf. its use by the London boatmen Gaffer and Riderhood in Our Mutual Friend and by the farmhands in Far from the Madding Crowd), the weakform of previously mentioned and H-dropping. ;Yer norrayin no tuffees!:You aren't having any toffees (sweets)! Humorous spellings here were chosen to indicate the Northern T-to-R rule and the phonological specification in the traditional dialect of , which is . However, there are many words in use in the traditional East Midlands Dialect which do not appear in standard English. The short list below is by no means exhaustive. More comprehensive glossaries exist within texts such as Ey Up Mi Duck by Richard Scollins and John Titford. ;naught : nothing (homographic with the digit cypher, 0, and the (now only literary) naught of General English; is a traditional dialect phonological specification and is the regular development in General English). ;aught : anything (homographic with the now literary General English ) ;nesh:a weak person, or one who feels the cold. Found in many parts of England, cf. its use in Hardy. ;belt-job:easy job (used in certain coal-mining communities based on watching a conveyor belt) ;causie:pavement (\\"causey\\" is an older word from which 'causeway' is derived.) ;cob:a bread roll (bap); (as verb) to throw ;cob loaf:baker's term used across the UK for a hemispherical loaf ;clouts:trousers (, usually pronounced ); (as verb:) hits something or someone. ;jitty/jetty:alleyway. ;twitchel:alleyway. Typically (but not exclusively) alleyways providing access to the rear of terraced housing. ;larup/larop:to cover with (usually a thick substance) ;mardy (or etymological marredy): grumpy, sulky (i.e. \\"She's a mardy one!\\") ;mash:to make a pot of tea (i.e. \\"I'll go mash the tea.\\") ;piggle:to pick at a scab, spot or a skin irritation (i.e. \\"Stop piggling that scab!\\") ;puddled/puddle-drunk: intoxicated or stupid ;puther:to pour out uncontrollably usually of smoke, steam or dust ;rammel:rubbish/waste ;scraight/scraitin':to cry/crying ;sile: rain heavily ;snapin or snap: lunch/food,tekken ta werk ;snidered/snided/snied:covered/infested, (DH Lawrence used the word 'Snied' in a description of an infestation of mice in Sons and Lovers.), ;wazzerk/wassock:fool (used across the East & West Midlands) There are also word forms that occur in Standard English but which have additional meanings in some of the varieties considered here. ;bonny: In many dialects, this has the sense of ‚Äòlooking well‚Äô often referring to a healthy plumpness.A New English Dictionary (1888) Bonny, adj., 2. b. (https://archive.org/stream/oed01arch#page/987/mode/1up)Oxford English Dictionary 2nd ed. (1989) Bonny, adj., 2. b. In Derby, Leicester and Nottingham, there still also exists a transferred sense of plump, robust, stout or overweight derived from this sense. Cf. Samuel Johnson‚Äôs comment that ‚Äò‚ÄòIt seems to be used in general conversation for plump‚Äô‚Äô as cited in NED Bonny 2 b as (J.). (There is a yet older sense now only commonly used in Scots, Northern & some Midland dialects meaning 'beautiful' generally rather than of individuals having a pleasing embonpoint specifically.)A New English Dictionary (1888) 2nd Bonny, adj., 1.

'Nen mate' can also be heard instead of \\"now then mate\\". People from Leicester are known in the popular holiday resort Skegness as \\"Chisits\\", due to their expression for \\"how much is it\\" when asking the price of goods in shops.Leicester Mercury, 16 July 2004 Phonology * East Midlands accents generally do not use a broad A, so that cast is pronounced rather than the pronunciation associated with the trap‚Äìbath split of most southern accents. * Most accents in the East Midlands lack the foot‚Äìstrut split, with words containing like strut or but being pronounced with , without any distinction between putt and put. * East Midlands accents are generally non-rhotic, instead drawing out their vowels, resulting in the Midlands Drawl, which can to non-natives be mistaken for dry sarcasm. * The PRICE vowel has a very far back starting-point, and can be realised as .Hughes, Trudgill & Watts ed., English accents and dialects: an introduction to social and regional varieties of English in the British Isles, chapter on Leicester's speech, Hodder Arnold, 2005 * Yod-dropping, as in East Anglia, can be found in some areas, for example new as , sounding like \\"noo\\". * H-dropping is common, in which is usually ommited from most words, while NG-coalescence is present in most of the East Midlands except in Derbyshire where is pronounced as .Wells (1982), pp. 189, 366. * In Lincolnshire, sounds like the u vowel of words like strut being realised as may be even shorter than in the North. * In Leicester, words with short vowels such as up and last have a northern pronunciation, whereas words with vowels such as down and road sound rather more like a south-eastern accent. The vowel sound at the end of words like border (and the name of the city) is also a distinctive feature. * Lincolnshire also has a marked north‚Äìsouth split in terms of accent. The north shares many features with Yorkshire, such as the open a sound in \\"car\\" and \\"park\\" or the replacement of take and make with tek and mek. The south of Lincolnshire is close to Received Pronunciation, although it still has a short Northern a in words such as bath. * Mixing of the words was and were when the other is used in Standard English. * In Northamptonshire, crossed by the North-South isogloss, residents of the north of the county have an accent similar to that of Leicestershire and those in the south an accent similar to rural Oxfordshire. * The town of Corby in northern Northamptonshire has an accent with some originally Scottish features, apparently due to immigration of Scottish steelworkers. It is common in Corby for the GOAT set of words to be pronounced with . This pronunciation is used across Scotland and most of Northern England, but Corby is alone in the Midlands in using it.Language in the British Isles, page 67, ed. David Britain, Cambridge University Press, 2007 Dialect variations within the political region =Southern Northamptonshire= Northamptonshire is in the East Midlands region defined in the late 20th century, and has historically harboured its own dialect comparable to other forms of East Midlands English, particularly among the older generation. However, more recently its linguistic distinctiveness has significantly eroded due to influences from the western parts of East Anglia, the West Midlands, and the South as well as the 'Watford Gap isogloss', the demarcation line between southern and northern English accents. The Danelaw split the present county into a Viking north and a Saxon south. This is quite plainly heard, with people in the south speaking more like people from Oxfordshire or Cambridgeshire and people in the north sounding more like people from Leicestershire. =Corbyite= Also of note is the anomalous dialect of Corbyite spoken around Corby in the north of Northamptonshire, which reflects the migration of large numbers of Scottish and Irish steelworkers to the town during the 20th century. The dialect is often compared to Glaswegian. =Derbyshire= The dialect of Coalville in Leicestershire is said to resemble that of Derbyshire because many of the Coalville miners came from there. Coalville's name is still almost exclusive pronounced as \\"Co-ville\\" by its inhabitants. Neighbouring pit villages such as Whitwick (\\"Whittick\\") share the Coalville inflection as a result of the same huge influx of Derbyshire miners. The city of Derby, as well as boroughs in the vicinity of the city such as Amber Valley and Erewash share a common Derby dialect, which sounds largely similar to other East Midlands dialects such as Nottingham and Leicester. However, many other dialects in the county are influenced by neighbouring areas and cities. For example, the dialect of Glossop in the High Peak borough is largely similar to the North West's Manchester dialect due to its close geographical position to Greater Manchester , while that of Chesterfield and Bolsover share commonalities with the South Yorkshire dialect owing to their proximity to Sheffield and Doncaster. In addition, the dialect of the Derbyshire Dales is near identical to that of the bordering North Staffordshire, mimicking dialects in and around Stoke-on-Trent, as well as that of Crewe in Cheshire, North West England. =Lincolnshire and East Lincolnshire= Lincolnshire has long been an economically relatively homogeneous, less industrial more heavily agricultural county and is in part naturally separated by the River Trent divorcing its largest market town, Gainsborough, Torksey & the City of Lincoln from Nottinghamshire. East of the Lincolnshire Wolds, in the southern part of the county, the Lincolnshire dialect is closely linked to The Fens and East Anglia where East Anglian English is spoken, and, in the northern areas of the county, the local speech has characteristics in common with the speech of the East Riding of Yorkshire. This is largely due to the fact that the majority of the land area of Lincolnshire was surrounded by sea, the Humber, marshland, and the Wolds; these geographical circumstances permitted little linguistic interference from the East Midlands dialects until the nineteenth century when canal and rail routes penetrated the eastern heartland of the country. =Nottinghamshire= Minor variations still endure between Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire. Though all native speakers sound similar, there are noticeable differences between the accents of residents of, for example, Nottingham and Derby, or Mansfield and Bolsover which is pronounced locally as . In North Nottinghamshire and North-East Derbyshire, the dialect is very similar to South Yorkshire, including the occasional use of the pronoun thou amongst older people. See Stephen Whyles's book A Scab is no Son of Mine for examples of speech of the Worksop area. Counties in which East Midlands English is spoken *Cambridgeshire (Limited usage around Peterborough) *Derbyshire (Limited usage in northern areas such as High Peak, Chesterfield and Bolsover) *Leicestershire *Lincolnshire (except areas within the Yorkshire and the Humber region) *Nottinghamshire (Usage less frequent in Bassetlaw) *Northamptonshire *Rutland *Staffordshire (Limited usage around Burton-upon- Trent and Uttoxeter) In popular culture The children's writer Helen Cresswell came from Nottingham, lived in Eakring and some of her characters featured on television during the 1970s and 1980s, such as Lizzie Dripping and Polly Flint, have distinct East Midlands accents, otherwise rarely heard in national broadcast media at the time.

West Midlands English is a group of dialects of the English language. County accents Certain areas of the West Midlands are stereotyped as having stronger accents than others, Dudley in the Black Country being an example. There are some local phrases in the Black Country that are renowned. People do tend to substitute a reply of \\"arr\\" for \\"yes\\". Generally, most words are shortened, most commonly being \\"I haven't\\" to \\"I ay\\" (which can be argued as an even shorter form of \\"I ain't\\"). In the south of the West Midlands (southern Warwickshire and Worcestershire), the accent is more similar to the general southern accent. Dave Bradley, a presenter on BBC Hereford and Worcester said in 2005 that: Phonology * West Midlands accents do not have the trap-bath split, so cast is pronounced rather than the pronunciation of most southern accents. The northern limit of the in many words crosses England from mid-Shropshire to The Wash, passing just south of Birmingham. * There is no foot‚Äìstrut split in the West Midlands, except for Herefordshire, with words containing like strut or but being pronounced with , without any distinction between putt and put. * H-dropping is common, in which the sound is usually ommited from most words. * There is no Ng-coalescence. Cases of the spelling -ing are pronounced as rather than . Wells noted that there were no exceptions to this rule in Stoke-on-Trent, whereas there were for other areas with the pronunciation, such as Liverpool.Wells in Trudgill ed., Language in the British Isles, page 58, Cambridge University Press, 1984 * Dialect verbs are used, for example am for are, ay for is not (related to ain't), bay for are not, bin for am or, emphatically, for are. Hence the following joke dialogue about bay windows: \\"What sort of windas am them?\\" \\"They'm bay windas.\\" \\"Well if they bay windas wot bin them?\\". There is also humour to be derived from the shop-owner's sign of Mr. \\"E. A. Wright\\" (that is, \\"He ay [isn't] right,\\" a phrase implying someone is saft [soft] in the jed [head]). Saft also may mean silly as in, \\"Stop bein' so saft\\". * The Birmingham and Coventry accents are distinct, even though the cities are only 19 miles/30 km apart. Coventry being closer to an East Midlands accent. * Around Stoke-on-Trent, the short i can sometimes sound rather like ee, as very obvious when hearing a local say it, however this is not always the case as most other words such as \\"miss\\" or \\"tip\\" are still pronounced as normal. The Potteries accent is perhaps the most distinctly 'northern' of the West Midlands accents, given that the urban area around Stoke-on-Trent is close to the Cheshire border. * Herefordshire and parts of Worcestershire and Shropshire have a rhotic accent somewhat like the West Country, and in some parts mixing with the Welsh accent, particularly when closer to the English/Welsh border.

In 1913 he founded the Manchester Press Agency but then joined the British Army in 1915 where he was awarded the Military Cross as a 2nd Lieutenant. After the war, he worked for many newspapers from 1921 until 1953, becoming chairman and editor of Truth for 12 years. His later career moved from journalism to broadcasting and participated in Any Questions and The Brains Trust for BBC Radio. Early life and background Born William Collin Brooks he was the son of William Edward Brooks (1864‚Äì1914) and Isabella (n√©e Thomas), herself the daughter of Griffith Thomas and Isabella (n√©e Harrison ‚Äì a descendant of Colonel Thomas Harrison of Cromwell's New Model Army). He was born and brought up in the north of England, spent only seven years in formal education, and after a short period as a trainee accountant became a commercial traveller for various companies, from the age of fifteen to twenty. In 1913 he founded the Manchester Press Agency. Brooks' father died only weeks before the outbreak of World War I, and his mother Isabella died eighteen months later, on Christmas Eve 1915. Two weeks later their son married Lillian Susanna Marsden, and the couple had five children: Barbara (who died in infancy); Rosemary Collin Brooks (1920‚Äì1971), whose career included a period working for MI5; Vivian Collin Brooks (1922‚Äì2003) ‚Äì a journalist who wrote a number of detective books under the pen-name \\"Osmington Mills\\"; William Austen Brooks (1924‚Äì1986), also a journalist: and Edward Clarke Brooks (1928‚Äì2010) who became an actor and wrote a number of short stories. In the war On 20 November 1915, Collin Brooks joined the British Army, and after a period driving tanks transferred to the machine gun corps. As a 2nd Lieutenant, he was awarded the Military Cross, his citation reading: ‚ÄúFor conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty during the attack across the Piave on 27 October 1918. This officer led his four guns forward under heavy shell and machine gun fire with the forward waves of the infantry. On arrival at the objective, by his skilful handling of his guns, he formed a defensive flank and in spite of heavy casualties he maintained his position. The coolness and energy of this officer was, throughout the action, a fine example to the men under him.‚Äù His own field notes ‚Äî taken from his pocket book ‚Äî of this event run as follows: :\\"Have reached C. Fighera with two gun teams and am held by hostile MG [machine gun] with which we are dealing. Teams were considerably weakened by rifle & MG fire. Fording the river and further (MG) support on left boundary line is requested. No counter attacks have developed & local resistance is being rapidly overcome. Our line was badly broken by initial resistance and by natural features and lateral communication is poor.\\" His next report states that nine men were wounded; this was followed by a report at 12:00 hrs: \\"At 11:00 I took over C. ARAGIOTTO and consolidated it into a double MG strongpoint firing W. and N. I am handing this over to No 2 Sec Select and am proceeding north.\\" Journalism His war service was followed by an increased awareness and involvement in politics and journalism. In 1921 he was employed by the Liverpool Courier; in 1923 he joined the Yorkshire Post, and moved in 1928 to their London office. This was followed by a move to the position of editor of the Financial News later that year. In 1933 he moved to the Sunday Dispatch, which began his long involvement with Harold Sidney Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere. He was shortly elevated to the position of Editor of the Sunday Dispatch.See Collin Brooks (ed. N.J. Crowson) Fleet Street, Press Barons and Politics: The Journals of Collin Brooks, 1932‚Äì1940, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998, This is the only volume to have appeared [January 2012]. With his work for Rothermere, the family spent time living both in London and also in Norfolk ‚Äì in a house called \\"The Mount\\" on Rothermere's Stody estate; the relationship between Brooks and Rothermere was sufficiently close that he was named as literary legatee in Rothermere's will. He later worked on a number of other papers, being from 1941 to 1953 chairman and Editor of Truth, an expos√© magazine of political and society issues, and wrote the magazine's \\"Letter to America\\" on a regular basis. He joined the Daily Express Group in 1953 and continued at the same time as chairman and leader writer of The Statist. He was also a ghost-writer for a number of people, and many political speeches and white papers were influenced to some extent by him. Other interests He was a member of a number of clubs, including the Savage Club, and the book \\"Brother Savages and Guests\\" by Percy V. Bradshaw includes some illustrations by Brooks. Other clubs of which he was a member were The Carlton, the Royal Thames Yacht Club, the City Livery, the Reform and the Press. Collin Brooks was a prolific writer, with over fifty books to his name, from authoritative works on finance and legal cases, through literary novels under his pen-name \\"Barnaby Brook\\" and two volumes of poetry, to what he called his \\"shockers\\" ‚Äì detective stories which introduced such memorable characters as eccentric amateur sleuth Lord Tweed, Raeburn Steel, Dan'l Forray and his twin daughters Jo and Jack, Inspector \\"Doleful\\" Debenham, and the unforgettable Oswald Swete McTavish. In addition to his published works he produced, throughout his life, his own Journals. The Journals cover a period of some three decades, and run to millions of words. For much of the time he had three or more literary works ‚Äì not including the Journals ‚Äì \\"on the go\\" at any one time, which one he worked on on any given day depending on his mood. His later career expanded from journalism into broadcasting, where he was a participant in Any Questions and of The Brains Trust, both for BBC Radio, and did a regular stint as \\"Northcountryman\\" on radio broadcasts. He was a man with a vast circle of friends, acquaintances and correspondents from many walks of life; his letters appear in a surprising number of collections.

It was released in 1981 by record label Ace of Hearts.  Content  The album's first track is \\"That's When I Reach for My Revolver,\\" which features a singable, anthemic chorus that helped make it one of the band's most popular songs. Though Mission of Burma's live performances were characterized by noise and chaos, Signals, Calls, and Marches has a notably \\"cleaner\\" sound in comparison to the band's live performances and subsequent recordings. Marc Masters of Pitchfork called this different sound \\"somewhat misrepresentative\\" of the band, as \\"[Producer Richard] Harte's production cleaned up the band's brutally loud live sound.\\" Guitarist Roger Miller noted that the sound probably helped the band become more accessible, recalling: > We played a show in Cleveland ('81 or '82) and we were on the street in > front of the club. A girl came up to us and said how much she was looking > forward to the show, and that she loved \\"That's When I Reach for My > Revolver\\". We thought we were golden. However, once we started playing, > people backed up against the wall and after the first song did not applaud > or respond to us one bit, even after we started heckling them. Even when we > played \\"Revolver\\". So, it is quite probably true that the \\"mild-mannered\\" > recording we made on Signals reached more people than if we recorded it in a > more furious or noisy fashion.  Release  Signals, Calls, and Marches was released on July 4, 1981 by record label Ace of Hearts. Upon its release in 1981, the record was immediately popular in the Boston area, charting at number six on local radio station WBCN's charts. The EP sold out its initial printing of ten thousand copies before the end of the year. For the CD reissue, Rykodisc remastered the six original songs and added the two tracks from the band's 1980 debut 7\\" single, \\"Academy Fight Song\\" and \\"Max Ernst\\". The EP was remastered by Matador Records in 2008 with video material and extra tracks.  Reception  Signals, Calls, and Marches has been well-received by critics. In his retrospective review, Mark Deming of AllMusic wrote, \\"if Mission of Burma were not yet at the peak of their form, most bands blazing as many trails as this one did lost their footing a lot more often that Burma did on these six songs; Signals, Calls and Marches was as accomplished and impressive a debut as any American band would release in the 1980s.\\" Marc Masters of Pitchfork called it \\"impeccable\\" and \\"probably the best Mission of Burma release ever.\\"  Legacy  Signals, Calls, and Marches is considered an immensely influential landmark in the field of indie rock and alternative rock. Mark Deming of AllMusic wrote, \\"One could argue that [Signals, Calls, and Marches] was the point where indie rock as a separate and distinct musical subgenre well and truly began. Mission of Burma's music had the brawn and the volume of hardcore punk, but with a lyrical intelligence and obvious musical sophistication that set them apart from the Southern California faster-and-louder brigade.\\" Marc Masters of Pitchfork opined that the EP \\"reverberated loudly through alternative rock for three decades, influencing everyone from R.E.M. to Fugazi to Nirvana.\\" Pitchfork ranked it the 53rd greatest album of the 1980s.

That he was related to the ruling dynasty of Capua seems likely, but is uncertain. He was installed at Capua by Pilgrim, Archbishop of Cologne, who besieged Capua and deposed the current prince, Pandulf IV was imprisoned in Germany. The Emperor Henry II officially granted the principality to Pandulf V in 1023 and associated his son John with him as co-prince. In 1024, at the behest of Guaimar III of Salerno, Emperor Conrad II released Pandulf IV. Guaimar and Pandulf promptly besieged Capua with the help of the Norman mercenary Rainulf Drengott. In 1025, the Byzantine catapan Basil Boiannes, who had been busy on a Sicilian expedition, joined them with a giant force. In 1026, after an 18-month siege, Boiannes negotiated Pandulf V's surrender and granted him and his son John safe conduct to Naples. In 1027, Pandulf IV, now reinstated, besieged Sergius IV of Naples, who had offered haven to Pandulf of Teano. The city fell and Sergius went into hiding. Pandulf and his son fled to either Rome or \\"Romania\\", where he died some years later. John was dead by 1052, when his younger brother Pandulf appears as the \\"firstborn\\" among his brothers.

It is situated on the north-western border of the city of Hamburg and approximately 5 km southeast of Pinneberg.  Geography  Halstenbek is located in a cultivated heath and bog area. Two small streams the Ballerbek and the D√ºpenau are crossing the area of Halstenbek, both are sourcing from the small lake Krupunder See.  History  Occasional archaeological finds of flint blades, stone axes and stone core evidences early human presence in the Stone Ages. The earliest secure evidence of settlements has been excavated in the 1920s and 1930s, where cremation cemeteries from the Stone Age, Bronze Age and Iron Ages and some bog iron refining places of the 12th century has been found. The earliest record of Halstenbek dates to 15 May 1296 where a Hamburg citizen was mentioned having borrowed some 30 marks from a man named Hartwicus located in Halstenbeke. At that time Halstenbek has already been a small village. The next written record comes from a 1309 will of Marquard Potekouwe. The form of the name Halstenbeke appears repeatedly in later records. The village of Halstenbek was under the administration of the County of Holstein-Pinneberg which was annexed to Holstein-Gl√ºckstadt in 1640, ruled in personal union with the Kingdom of Denmark. In the course of the Thirty Years' War 1625-1627 Danish soldiers devastated the village. Later Halstenbek suffered from Swedish-Polish Wars 1658-1660 and the War of the Spanish Succession 1701-1714. The Industrial Revolution in the early 19th century starts Halstenbeks revival. After the devastating fire of Hamburg in 1842 the agriculture specialized into plant nursery, as large quantities of trees were required for building houses and planting trees in parks and along the streets. After Prussias victory over Denmark in 1864 and the founding of the North German Confederation in 1867 Halstenbek and the district of Pinneberg were under Prussian administration. The direct administration (Drostei) was located in the city of Pinneberg. 1883 Halstenbek received a connection to the railway network with its own freight yard, which promoted the marketing of trees and plants from the Halstenbek plant nurseries substantially. The First World War brought the next big economical break. During the \\"Third Reich\\" the administration of Halstenbek was brought into line. The plant nurseries found new markets such as plantings for green strips of the new Autobahns. During World War II the supply situation in food deteriorated and the plant nurseries switched their production to food crops. But they also continued to deliver plants, but now for camouflage purposes. Soon after beginning of the war four heavy anti-aircraft batteries were stationed at a field near today's L√ºbzer Stra√üe. Towards the end of the war the railway station of Halstenbek were destroyed by allied bombs. When Hamburg was declared a fortress, the border of the \\"Fortress Ring\\" were directly following the border of the villages of Halstenbek and Krupunder. An anti tank ditch was built south of the railway line parallel to today's \\"L√ºbzer Stra√üe\\". North of the railway line the anti tank ditch followed the railway track. The southern anti-tank ditch has been built by male inmates of the concentration camp Neuengamme, the northern ditch were built by Jewish women from the concentration camp outpost of Lurup. After the war, the town fell under British occupation. New administrative structures were set up and houses were built for refugees from eastern German provinces. In connection with the general reconstruction after the war, the demand for forest plants was increasing steadily and thus one of the major economic factors of the village of Halstenbek was prospering. In the 1970s, the freight railway station was closed. Since the beginning of the 20th century and again since the end of World War II the population of the municipality grew rapidly. The majority of the new residents no longer worked in the village, but in the nearby City of Hamburg. In the 1970s the Autobahn 23 has been built and new industrial areas were set up along the Autobahn. Halstenbek is well known for its so called Wohnmeile ( German for mile of home decoration) a shopping street with lot of furniture shops which is also sometimes derogatory called M√∂belmeile (furniture mile). Points of interest Halstenbek is the site of the so-called Knick-Ei, a gymnastics arena, the roof of which collapsed twice during construction and which was never completed. The building is nevertheless used in exhibitions as an example of \\"New German architecture\\". Education Japanische Schule in Hamburg Hastenbek hosts six kindergartens, two primary schools Grundschule Bickbargen and Grund- und Gemeinschaftsschule an der Beek, as well as the secondary school Wolfgang-Borchert-Gymnasium.

The race covers over 4,000 miles with a stop in the Madeira or the Canary Islands. The yachts are very small considering the scope of the race, and are sanctioned by the Miniclasse 6.5 organization and material specifications, which make the mini Transat 650 boat an open design. The Miniclasse 6.50 closely monitors the craft but applies minimal design restrictions, such as length (6.5m), beam (3.0m), draft (approximately 2.0m) The race runs on odd-numbered years, and was most recently completed in 2019. Sailors had to qualify by covering one of two specified 1,000 mile courses along with having 1,500 miles of ocean racing experience, much of it solo. Two Mini 6.50 sailboats along the Spanish Mediterranean. Note the width of the sterns that allows minis to reach high speeds by planing. 6.50 Class Classe Mini Logo, Mini Transat 6.50, unofficial logo For its intended use, racing across the Atlantic Ocean, the Mini 6.50 is very short and beamy, being nearly half as wide as it is long. Its width carries to the stern, providing sufficient stability that the boats can plane as a fast motorboat does: Minis are capable of sailing as fast as 25 knots. They typically have two connected rudders and a narrow steel or iron fin keel with a lead bulb at the end, with a mast height typically twice the Mini's length. They also have a retractable bowsprit that extends a spinnaker- genoa \\"kite\\" two or more meters beyond the bow. Minis must be self-righting when capsized, and this is tested by pushing the end of the mast under water with the vessel's hatches open; this design avoids the possibility of turtling. There are two divisions: production and prototype. Production boats use approved designs and comparatively conservative materials. The prototype division is more liberal with respect to dimensions, such as keel depth and mast height, and it allows for advanced technology such as \\"canting\\" keels and carbon-fibre masts. The prototype class is approximately 7% faster. By far, the most successful mini design is the commercially produced Pogo 2 designed by Jean-Marie Finot of Groupe Finot (now Finot-Conq) in 1995. In 2010, California's Open Sailing USA began building the Pogo 2, under license, giving hope for substantial mini racing in the Western Hemisphere. Though considered \\"accessible\\" as an ocean racing class, a used Pogo 2 costs upwards of $97,000. European prices, as of 2018, for a used Pogo 2, starting at 20-25,000 Euro. Race culture There are no prizes and the Mini Transat is not necessarily considered a race for the win. Sailors are competitive yet mutually-supportive during training and preparations, they tend to be closely grouped during the race, and a race completion is seen as a personal or national victory that comes with intangible rewards. Non-completion means, at very least, loss of the mini. The race is considered dangerous and there was a drowning during the first leg of the 2009 race. Racers typically sleep only 20 minutes at a time and rely on computerized autopilot systems to keep the craft on course while they sleep. The class is considered an incubator for professional ocean racing as a proving ground for sailing skills, as well as a test platform for larger ocean classes such as the Open 60. Other than the single-handed transatlantic crossing, there are a good many other races held for the class. In-between years see double-handed events, such as the Mini Fastnet, Mini Barcelona, Select 650 and Open Demi-Cle. The Transat years incorporate more single-handed events. History Bob Salmon developed the idea of a mini-transatlantic race in the late 1970s in England with the intent of promoting affordable offshore solo racing. It was partially conceived as a response to the trend for bigger and more expensive boats such as sailed in the OSTAR race that seemed to exclude ocean racing for sailors with moderate budgets. The first Mini Transat started from the Penzance Sailing Club in 1977 and races have since run bi- annually on odd numbered years. There was a move to Brest, France in 1985, and since then, it has started at various locations in France, such as Brittany, La Rochelle or Charente-Maritime, with a stop in the Canary Islands or Madeira ending in the West Indies or Brazil. Criticism cockpit from stern In response to the perceived challenge of sailing small high-performance single handed boats, Classemini has created rigorous trials, equipment, and inspection requirements to add sanity to the race. Also, it might be said that the division within the class, production vs. prototype, unnecessarily divides the race. The mini Transat remains a largely French race with only about 30% non-French racers. The 650 class is admitted to be a \\"test bed\\" for mechanisms to be used on bigger and far more expensive open classes. On the other hand, David Raison's Mini introduces a whole new hull shape with its 2011 victory, which may, in fact, revolutionize open ocean racing if not sailing altogether; and the 2011 race suffered no casualties.

He also had the distinction of being the first Cornishman to play for the England national team, a decorated World War I soldier, and an actor. His younger brothers, Donald Cock and Herbert Cock, also played professional football. Playing career Born in Hayle, he started his football career with amateur clubs West Kensington United, Forest Gate and Old Kingstonians. He played three Southern League Division Two matches in March 1914 as an amateur for Brentford, scoring one goal, before signing professional forms with Yorkshire side Huddersfield Town later that year, though the First World War broke out shortly afterwards. He served in the British Army during the conflict, rising to the rank of Acting Sergeant-Major and earning the Military Medal for \\"Bravery in the Field\\" and a Mentioned in Despatches for \\"gallantry\\". He was reported as 'missing, presumed dead' at one point during the war. During his breaks from military service, he turned out for London sides Brentford and Croydon Common. While with Brentford, Cock scored six hattricks, a wartime record he shares with Len Townsend. Cock also played for England in the Victory International in 1919. With the resumption of league football in 1919, he moved back to Huddersfield who, at the time, were in severe financial trouble. Cock was sold to David Calderhead's Chelsea for a record ¬£2,500 in October that year. A skilful, nimble striker with a powerful shot, he had a fanatical dedication to fitness, often staying behind to train long after his teammates had gone home. He scored twice on his Chelsea debut against Bradford and hit 22 more that season in 30 league games, a key factor in the club finishing third in the League and reaching the FA Cup semi-finals. Cock's first season with the Stamford Bridge club proved to be his most successful, and thereafter his goalscoring record was never as prolific, though he was still top scorer at the club in 1920‚Äì21 and 1921‚Äì22. After scoring one goal in 11 appearances in 1922‚Äì23, he was transferred to Everton in February 1923. He ended his Chelsea career with a nonetheless impressive 53 goals from 110 games. Cock remained on Merseyside for two years, before signing for Plymouth Argyle in March 1925, where he scored 72 League goals in just 90 games, including a club record 32 goals in 39 League games in 1926‚Äì27. However, the club finished 2nd in the Third Division South in each of his three seasons there and thus missed out on promotion. His playing career ended on a high note, though, when he moved to Millwall and scored 92 goals in 135 appearances, helping the club win the Division Three South title in 1927‚Äì28. His 77 League goals there remained a club record until 1973. He is currently Millwall's fourth all-time leading scorer, with 83 goals in all competitions. Cock ended his first class playing career with 234 Football League goals from 391 matches. He wound down playing for non-league sides such as Folkestone and Walton & Hersham. He managed Millwall between 1944 and 1948, leading them to the War Cup South final at Wembley in 1945, where they lost to his old side Chelsea. The club's playing squad was hit hard by World War II and they were relegated at the end of the 1947‚Äì48 season; he left the job shortly afterwards. He made his England debut against Ireland in 1919, and opened the scoring after 30 seconds, which is currently the third-fastest timed England goal of all time. He won a second (and final) cap against Scotland in 1920, again scoring. Owing to his good looks and a tenor voice, Cock appeared on the music hall stage numerous times (during his playing days, he was known for singing before entering the pitch). He also starred in several films, including \\"The Winning Goal\\" (1920) and \\"The Great Game\\" (1930). He later ran a pub in New Cross. He died in Kensington on 19 April 1966, at the age of 72.

The National Youth Jazz Orchestra (NYJO) is a British jazz orchestra founded in 1965 by Bill Ashton. In 2010 Mark Armstrong took over as Music Director of the flagship performing band, and Artistic Director of the organisation; Bill Ashton became Life President, and Nigel Tully became Executive Chair. Based in Westminster, London, NYJO started life as the London Schools' Jazz Orchestra and evolved into becoming the national orchestra. Its aims are to provide an opportunity for gifted young musicians from around the UK to perform big band jazz in major concert halls, theatres, and on radio and television, and to make recordings, commission new works from British composers and arrangers, and to introduce a love of jazz to as wide an audience as possible, but especially to schoolchildren. The performing band, NYJO, is selected by audition and invitation, and has a maximum age of 25. It performs around 40 gigs a year across the UK, the vast majority involving additional inspirational educational workshops for local schoolchildren, in partnership with the local Music Hub. It rehearses every Saturday at the London Centre of Contemporary Music, near London Bridge, London. In 2011, a new band, NYJO London, was created to focus on developing school aged jazz musicians in greater London. In 2013 NYJO's London training and education activities were brought together under the banner of the NYJO Academy, which now includes the NYJO Academy Big Band, the NYJO Academy Jazz Ensemble, NYJO London, and the NYJO Academy Vocal Class. A small charge (¬£5 per session) is made for attendance. In April 2015 NYJO became an Arts Council England National Portfolio Organisation (NPO), in recognition of its unique role as an excellent youth arts institution and its ability to inspire young people to like and enjoy jazz. At the same time NYJO acquired jazz's first ever Royal patron, the Earl of Wessex, who had seen the band perform live at Buckingham Palace in December 2014. NYJO has an extensive discography of over 40 recordings. A new double CD album entitled NYJO FIFTY was released in late 2015 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of NYJO's formation, with guest appearances by alumnus Mark Nightingale and by Zoe Rahman and Julian Siegel, both of whom were commissioned to write new works for the album.\\"NYJO FIFTY by The National Youth Jazz Orchestra\\" at Whirlwind Records.

It was first identified in the 1920s among several small, discrete communities along the Danube River and its major tributaries, in the modern countries of Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Romania, and Bulgaria. It is caused by small long-term doses of aristolochic acid in the diet. The disease primarily affects people 30 to 60 years of age. Doses of the toxin are usually low and people moving to endemic areas typically develop the condition only when they have lived there for 10-20 years. People taking higher doses of aristolochic acid (as Chinese herbal supplements) have developed kidney failure after shorter durations of exposure.Stiborov√°, M., Arlt, V.M. & Schmeiser, H.H.

Arch Toxicol 90, 2595‚Äì2615 (2016). https://doi.org/10.1007/s00204-016-1819-3 Signs and symptoms  The patients are distinguished from those suffering from other causes of end-stage renal disease by showing an absence of high blood pressure, xanthochromia of palms and soles (Tanchev's sign), early hypochromic anemia, absence of proteinuria, and slow progression of kidney failure. There is no specific therapy; BEN causes end-stage renal disease, for which the only effective treatments are dialysis or a kidney transplant. In endemic areas BEN is responsible for up to 70% of end-stage renal disease. At least 25,000 individuals are known to have this form of the disease.The Epidemiology, Diagnosis, and Management of Aristolochic Acid Nephropathy: A Narrative Review Annals of Internal Medicine 19 March 2013, Vol 158, No. 6 Patients with BEN have a greatly increased rate of transitional cell carcinoma of the upper urothelial tract, (the renal pelvis and ureters).

U.S. Department of Health & Human Services. National Institutes of Health, National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences. https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/8576/balkan-endemic-nephropathy In the Balkan region, dietary aristolochic acid exposure may come from the consumption of the seeds of Aristolochia clematitis (European birthwort), a plant native to the endemic region, which grows among wheat plants and whose seeds mingle with the wheat used for bread. Aristolochic-acid-containing herbal remedies used in traditional Chinese medicine are associated with a related‚Äîpossibly identical‚Äîcondition known as \\"Chinese herbs nephropathy\\". Exposure to aristolochic acid is associated with a high incidence of uroepithelial tumorigenesis. History The first official published description of the disease was made by the Bulgarian nephrologist Dr.Yoto Tanchev (1917-2000) and his team in 1956 in the Bulgarian Journal Savremenna Medizina,Tanchev Y, Evstatiev Z, Dorossiev D, Pencheva J, Tzvetkova G. Studies on the nephritides in the District of Vratza. Savremena Medicina 1956; 7: 14‚Äì29 (Bulgarian). a priority generally acknowledged by the international nephrological community. Their study was based on a wide screening of inhabitants of the villages around the town of Vratsa, Bulgaria. Their contribution to the understanding of this unusual endemic disease of the kidneys was their description of symptoms which were not typical of common chronic nephritis, i.e., incidence only in adults (no children affected), absence of high blood pressure, xanthochromia of palms and soles (Tanchev's sign), early hypochromic anemia, absence of proteinuria, and slow progression of kidney failure. A striking feature of the disease is its very localized occurrence. There are approximately ten small areas where it occurs, all of them more or less rural, but nothing seems to connect those areas other than the occurrence of this illness. Tanchev and colleagues suggested that the condition was sui generis. Their initial tentative hypothesis for its cause was intoxication with heavy metals, because the affected villages were supplied with water coming from nearby Vratsa Mountain, a karst-type mountain. The disease was originally called \\"Vratsa nephritis,\\" and became known as \\"Balkan endemic nephropathy\\" later, after people living in Yugoslavia and Romania were found to be suffering from it as well. But in Bulgaria and in neighbouring countries, the condition is known as \\"Tanchev's Nephropathy\\", in homage to Dr. Tanchev's work.

His 1999 album The Man with a Suitcase was part of a trend in the late 1990s of \\"imaginary soundtracks\\", compositions created to accompany films that did not actually exist. In the soundtrack, he attempted to pay homage to works of the 1960s and 1970s such as The Avengers and Mission Impossible, with a mixture of jazz, pop, rock, and funk.

He joined the Haganah in 1944 and commanded a company in the Arab-Israeli War in 1948. He continued to serve in the Israeli Defense Forces in a variety of command, staff and training posts. He headed the Northern Command of the IDF during the Yom Kippur War in 1973. He was Acting Chief of Staff for a brief period in 1974, before retiring from the military and taking the post of director of Mossad. Before that he was a general in the Israeli Defense Forces in charge of the Northern Command. In July 1976, Hofi lobbied strongly for a rescue mission to be mounted to save the large number of Israeli passengers on a hijacked Air France airliner flown to Entebbe International Airport in Uganda. In order to facilitate the resulting Operation Entebbe, Hofi directed Mossad katsas to survey the airport, and used contacts in Kenyan intelligence to allow the refueling of Israeli planes in Nairobi on the return journey. During his tenure as Director of the Mossad, Israel carried out Operation Opera, a surprise Israeli attack on Iraq's nuclear reactor in Osirak. In addition, the Mossad under his command assassinated a number of Palestinian terrorists, including Ali Hassan Salameh, chief of operations for the Black September Organization.

As the radio station began to grow, the sister AM station's influence lessened. Some of the talent and programming staff that worked for WAZY in the 1970s moved on to become programmers in New York City, Philadelphia, and Chicago. The tide really turned for the station when it flipped its Top Forty by day and AOR by night format to all Top Forty. Jeffrey Jay Weber, who later became one of the first PD's to make the move directly to GM when he left the station to go to an AM-FM in Terre Haute, was instrumental in the station's growth in the late seventies, along with jocks like Bobby Day, Dan Michaels, Lou Patrick, Scott Dugan, Bob Leonard, Keith Harris and Steve West.

He was conferred the title of sardar for his fearless fight against the British Raj. He was the born leader of masses, freedom fighter and social reformer. Till Independence, he fought against British. After the end of British Raj, it was on political and social fronts for the sake of farmers, labourers, and the working class. He was also the member of Madras Trade Union Board.Post-independence India: Indian National Congress, Volumes 33‚Äì50 By Om Prakash Ralhan ‚Äì G.

As an undertrail, he was sent to Tekkali and Narasannapeta sub-jails in Srikakulam. After conviction, he was sent to Berhampur jail in Ganjam to undergo rigorous imprisonment for one month.At the age of 21, Sri. Latchanna was arrested in connection with the salt-cotaurs raid After the Gandhi‚ÄìIrwin Pact in 1931, he organised Satyagraha camp at Baruva and conducted picketing of toddy, liquor, and foreign cloth shops in Ichchapuram, Sompeta and Tekkali as permitted by the British Government as part of the Gandhi‚ÄìIrwin Pact.Consequent on the 1931 Gandhi-Irwin Pact, Sri Latchanna organized the Congress Satyagraha camp In 1932, he participated in the civil disobedience movement by hoisting the Congress flag at Baruva, was lathi-charged for violating prohibitory orders and was imprisoned in Rajahmundry central jail for six months.lathi-charged during the 1932 civil disobedience movement for hoisting the Congress flag at Baruva In 1932, after getting released from Rajahmundry jail, having been inspired by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi's \\"fast- unto-death\\" on the issue of untouchability, Latchanna organised \\"Harijan Seva Sangam\\" at Baruva. He started a night school in the harijan-cheri, agitated at the district level against untouchability, and took harijans to a drinking water well at Baruva. He and his colleagues were socially boycotted in response.Latchanna was inspired by Mahatma Gandhi‚Äôs fast-unto-death at Yeravada Central jail on the issue of untouchability Gandhi began a fast-unto- death while imprisoned in the Yeravada Central Jail of Pune in 1932 to eliminate discrimination and untouchability As a secretary of Andhra Rashtra Congree Committee, he organised a reception at Eluru for the soldiers of Azad Hind Fauz, revived by Subhas Chandra Bose.Latchanna organised reception at Eluru to the soldiers of the Azad Hind Fauz founded by Netaji Subash Chandra Bose Latchanna participated in the Quit India Movement in 1942, which ultimately led to violent raids on the Kalingapatnam post office, armoury train derailment in his native village Baruva, no-tax campaign, and raids on srikakulam sub-collector offices. Then Madras government announced the prize of 10,000 rupees for whereabout information of Latchanna, failing to trace him, government issued orders for shoot-at-sight.The Quit India Movement of 1942 Gandhi refused to condemn the violence of the people because he saw it as a reaction to the much bigger violence being perpetrated on the state. It is held that Gandhi's major objection to violence was that its use prevented mass participation in a movement. For in 1942, Gandhi had come round to the view that mass participation would not be restricted as a result of isolated violence. Gandhi had come to realise that the kind of non-violence he had wanted his country men to inculcate and practise could not be achieved and so towards the end of his career he had kept some amount of space for the participants to follow their own line of action. His patience had been dragged to such extremes that he felt that even at the cost of some risks, he should ask his people to resist slavery. Although Gandhi was now in an unusually militant mood, at no stage was he prepared to forsake his faith in non- violence. He would have liked the movement to be non-violent but was prepared to run the risk of unrestricted mass action even if that meant civil war. He thus said, 'Let them entrust India to God or, in modem parlance, to anarchy'. While underground he was invited for the South Indian Congress leaders meeting at Madras. Latchanna and Killi Appala Naidu started proceeding to Madras. A message about this was sent by Andhra Congress dictator Sampath Kumar through Jayanthi Dharma Teja, which led to the arrest of Latchanna at Rajahmundry in 1943 while he was on his way to Madras. Latchanna was sentenced for one year for possessing seditious literature and sent to Alipuram camp jail while Killi Appala Naidu was sent as a detenue to Tanjavur central jail.Latchanna and his colleague Killi Appala Naidu were arrested and imprisoned Immediately after the release from Alipuram camp jail, he was re-arrested at the gate and sent to Cannanore central jail, Tanjavur central jail and then to Rayavellore jail. He was finally released from Rayavellore jail in October 1945. Revolutionary influence With imprisonment in Rajahmundry central jail aftermath the civil disobedience in 1932, he came in contact with revolutionists like Vijay Kumar Sinha (Bijoy Kumar Sinha) and Siva Verma who were life imprisoned in Lahore Conspiracy Case in connection with Bhagat Singh who were also imprisoned in the same block in which Latchanna was imprisoned. Siva Verma and B.J. Sinha were transferred from Cellular Jail to Rajahmundry central prison aftermath the fast-unto-death in demand for separate treatment for political prisoners. Latchanna along with Andhra colleagues like Anne Anjayya and Alluri Satyanarayanaraju used to have long discussions in prison about \\"Indian Republic Revolutionary Party\\" organisation. They decided to start the similar revolutionary party in Andhra after their release. As Latchanna was released with 6 months conviction before his Andhra colleagues who were convicted for one year, he and his colleagues decided to meet again to start revolutionary party after release too.Latchanna was lodged in the same block where Sri. Vijaya Kumar Sinha and Sri. Siva Varma, life prisoners in the Bhagat Singh Case In the meantime, Latchanna went to Cuttack, Kharagpur, Tatanagar, and Calcutta to meet the \\"Indian Republic Revolutionary Party\\" leaders for joining their movement as promised to Siva Verma and B.K.

He organised estate wise \\"Zamindari Rythu\\" associations, organised indirect no-tax campaign, fought for the abolition of Zamindari system on the plea that Kisans were unable to pay the heavy land revenue levied.Latchanna started agitations for the abolition of the Zamindari system In 1940, he organised All India Kisan Sabha at Palasa which were attended by Pullela Syama Sundara Rao, N.

It was followed by public meeting of the All India Kisan Sabha violating the prohibitory orders of then Composite Madras government.All India Kissan Sabha at Palasa in 1940 Immediately, after the All India Kisan Sabha at Palasa, the \\"Mandasa Ryots\\" under the leadership of lady \\"Veeragunnamma\\" of Gudari Rajamanipuram, took out a procession with their bullock carts into the forest of the Mandasa Zamindari, cut trees and took them to their villages openly by driving away the estate forest guards. This led to the arrest of kisans by police under subcollector of Srikakulam.

Veeragunnamma, four kisans and one police constable in Mandasa Ryots Latchanna along with Syama Sundara Rao visited Mandasa village to talk with sub collector, but were denied interview. Latchanna visited the village and opened a defence camp at Haripuram to prevent police harassment of kisans. When police were finding it difficult in preparing charge sheet against kisans, Latchanna was interned at his native village, Baruva. In spite of intensive vigilance, Latchanna toured the villages during nights and exhorted public. This secret assistance forced district collector in ordering the detention of Latchanna, which he escaped by going underground. While underground, he fought the case and got the case struck down from sessions court.Yerran Naidu said, Sardar Latchanna was credited with leading the Mandasa peasants' struggle and maintaining a regular rapport with all the villagers of Srikakulam district =Leader for weaker sections= In 1941 when Rangoon was bombarded during Second World War, Latchanna in spite of being underground, arranged ‚ÄúBurma refugee‚Äôs conference‚Äù at Narasannapeta, presided by N.G. Ranga to assist the Indian labourers in Burma who fled to their native land, India.

Consequently, he took statewide tours and organised district backward classes associations, which made him designated as champion of backward classes and was considered one of the prominent leaders of his time. In 1957 after the formation of united Andhra Pradesh, chief justice of Andhra Pradesh high court struck down the list of Other Backward Classes approved by government of Andhra Pradesh acting on a private complaint. Latchanna started a statewide agitation for the restoration of list of Other Backward Classes, a statutory obligation under the Articles 15(4) and 16(4) of the Constitution of India. List of Other Backward Classes were restored when Damodaram Sanjivayya became chief minister of Andhra Pradesh.Sri Latchanna started a State Level agitation for the restoration of the list of other Backward Classes, a statutory obligation under the Articles 15(4) and 16(4) of the Indian Constitution High Court again struck down the list of Other Backward Classes for including Kapu community in the Other Backward Classes. Latchanna again, started statewide agitation and demanded the government of Andhra Pradesh to renew the publication of backward classes list by omitting Kapu. The case finally went to Supreme Court of India to be represented by advocate P. Shiv Shankar on behalf of government along with an advocate appointed by Latchanna on behalf of Andhra Pradesh backward classes association. Supreme Court of India gave a favourable judgement asking the government of Andhra Pradesh to publish the list of backward classes caste wise establishing their social and economical backwardness. In consequence, the Government of Andhra Pradesh appointed the \\"Ananta Raman Commission\\" which recommended the list of Backward Classes by dividing them into 4 groups as A, B,C & D.P.Siva Sankar, then a senior advocate of the High-court, argued the case successfully in the Supreme Court and got a favourable judgement stating that the government of Andhra Pradesh could publish the list of Backward classes caste wise establishing their social and educational backwardness. On behalf of the A.P.B.C. Association. Sri Latchanna also appointed an advocate to argue the case. In consequence, the Government of Andhra Pradesh appointed the Ananta Raman Commission which recommended the list of Backward Classes by dividing them into 4 groups as A, B,C & D. After N. T. Rama Rao came to power in Andhra Pradesh, when he cancelled Backward Classes scholarship grants against his election manifesto including cancellations of licenses of the toddy tappers co-operative societies for public auctions, Latchanna took serious objection and did satyagraha on behalf of the backward classes students and toddy tappers co-operative societies for cancelling public auctions. During N. T. Rama Rao regime with statewide agitations, Latchanna was arrested more than 14 times forcing him to take fast-unto-death to accomplish the demands.During his statewide agitation Sri Latchanna was arrested 14 times during Sri. N.T. Rama Rao's regime After Nadendla Bhaskara Rao overthrown N. T. Rama Rao regime through coupe, Nadendla Bhaskara Rao fulfilled the demands of Latchanna.N. Bhaskara Rao, who suddenly became the Chief Minister of the Telugu Desam Government by overthrowing Sri. N.T.Rama Rao, when the later had been abroad,accepted the demands of Sri. Latchanna From 1984, disgusted with opportunistic politics of different political parties, Latchanna mostly concentrated in raising awareness among oppressed classes using his monthly publication \\"Bahujana\\".Newspaper Bahujana Post- independence India:Indian National Congress, Volumes 33‚Äì50 By Om Prakash Ralhan ‚Äì G. Latchanna ‚Äì Bahujana, a monthly devoted to the upliftment of backward classes, published in English and Telugu He tried to join Bahujan Samaj Party under the leadership of Kanshiram for the upliftment to Schedule Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Backward Classes. He announced his joining in Bahujan Samaj Party in 1994 at Hyderabad, but couldn't join the Bahujan Samaj Party due to certain ideological differences which were against backward classes of Andhra Pradesh, as he felt, Kanshiram was trying to exploit backward classes for only votes.Sri Latchanna declared that the joined BSP at a public meeting at Hyderabad in 1994 Political life He was member of Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly for 35 years from Sompeta constituency between 1948‚Äì83 and once member of Andhra Pradesh Legislative Council.

Ranga.Yerran Naidu said, ‚ÄúSardar Latchanna, who hailed from Sompeta in Srikakulam had become undisputed leader of the backward classes. He had such a devotion towards his guru N.G. Ranga that he gave up his Srikakulam Lok Sabha seat without taking oath just to enable his guru to enter the Lower House after his failure to win from the Chittoor constituency. He was first elected to Assembly in 1948 from Visakhapatnam on labour ticket and served as Minister for Agriculture and Labour. He left Congress party in 1951 and was arrested during emergency in 1975 imposed by then prime minister Smt. Indira Gandhi.

It is one of the largest kestrels and is found in open country in southern and eastern Africa. Description At Etosha National Park, Namibia The plumage of the adult is mainly pale rufous, both above and below. The back, upperwing and flanks are barred with black. The breast has dark streaks and the head is streaked but has no malar stripe unlike the common and lesser kestrels. The rump and tail are grey with black bars; the tail has a white tip. In flight, the whitish underwing contrasts with the darker body. The iris of the eye is whitish, distinguishing the bird from any similar species. The bill is mainly blue-grey and the feet and cere are yellow. Juvenile birds have rufous instead of grey on the tail, streaked flanks and a dark eye. The bird is long with a wingspan of The southern subspecies F. r. rupicoloides weighs about 181‚Äì334gr (.400‚Äì.736 lb). The form F. r. arthuri is smaller, weighing about 165‚Äì252gr (.364‚Äì.556 lb). The northern subspecies F. r. fieldi is also small and is paler than the others. The species is usually silent but has a shrill, repeated call. Habitat and range It occurs in open, arid areas where it inhabits grassland, savannas and semi-desert. It is often associated with acacias. It prefers areas where the ground cover is lower than 50 cm. It is found from sea-level up to 2150 metres, particularly between 800 and 1800 metres. It is fairly common and widespread in the southern parts of its range but is scarce and patchily distributed further north. The form F. r. rupicoloides breeds in Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, parts of Angola and Zambia and in much of South Africa apart from the wetter regions of the south and east. F. r. arthuri is found in Kenya and northern Tanzania while F. r. fieldi occurs in Ethiopia, Eritrea, northern Somalia and probably northern Kenya. The total range covers about 3.5 million km2. The population is stable and is likely to be in the order of 100,000 to 200,000 pairs. Most birds are sedentary but some are nomadic or dispersive. Feeding The greater kestrel usually hunts from an exposed perch such as a tree or rock. It also hovers like several other kestrels. It feeds mainly on invertebrates such as grasshoppers, termites, beetles and solifugids. It also takes lizards and sometimes small birds, mammals and snakes. It mainly catches prey on the ground. It is attracted to fires where it catches insects and other prey as they flee from the flames. Excess food may be cached underneath vegetation or stones. Reproduction Juvenile, Serengeti National Park, Tanzania The breeding season varies between different regions. In the south it lasts from July to April with a peak between September and December. Breeding takes place in all months in Kenya and Tanzania but is concentrated between April and July. The season lasts from April to August in Somalia. Greater kestrels use the old nest of another bird for breeding, such as that of a Cape crow or pied crow. A typical site is between 2 and 20 metres above the ground in a tree or sometimes on a telegraph pole or pylon. Two to seven eggs are laid with three or four being most common. They are incubated for 22 to 23 days, mainly by the female. The young birds fledge after 30 to 34 days and remain dependent on their parents for at least 26 days longer.

It is encountered in patients with myelopathy, thoracic disease, cerebrovascular disease, nerve trauma or after surgeries. The exact mechanism of the phenomenon is poorly understood. It is attributed to the perception in the hypothalamus (brain) that the body temperature is too high. The sweating is induced to reduce body heat. Excessive sweating due to nervousness, anger, previous trauma or fear is called hyperhidrosis. Compensatory hyperhidrosis is the most common side effect of endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy, a surgery to treat severe focal hyperhidrosis, often affecting just one part of the body. It may also be called rebound or reflex hyperhidrosis. In a small number of individuals, compensatory hyperhidrosis following sympathectomy is disruptive, because afflicted individuals may have to change sweat-soaked clothing two or three times a day. According to Dr Hooshmand, sympathectomy permanently damages the temperature regulatory system. The permanent destruction of thermoregulatory function of the sympathetic nervous system causes latent complications, e.g., RSD in contralateral extremity.Sympathectomy failure Following surgery for axillary (armpit), palmar (palm) hyperhidrosis (see focal hyperhidrosis) and blushing, the body may sweat excessively at untreated areas, most commonly the lower back and trunk, but can be spread over the total body surface below the level of the cut. The upper part of the body, above the sympathetic chain transection, the body becomes anhidriotic, where the patient is unable to sweat or cool down, which further compromises the body's thermoregulation and can lead to elevated core temperature, overheating and hyperthermia. Below the level of the sympathetic chain interruption, body temperature is significantly lower, creating a stark contrast that can be observed on thermal images. The difference in temperatures between the sympathetically under- and overactive regions can be as high as 10 Celsius. Variations Gustatory sweating or Frey's syndrome is another presentation of autonomic neuropathy. Gustatory sweating is brought on while eating, thinking or talking about food that produces a strong salivary stimulus. It is thought that ANS fibres to salivary glands have become connected in error with the sweat glands after nerve regeneration. Apart from sweating in the anhidriotic area of the body, it can produce flushing, goosebumps, drop of body temperature - vasoconstriction and paresthesia. Aberrant gustatory sweating follows up to 73% of surgical sympathectomiesDisorders of Sweating: Hyperhidrosis and is particularly common after bilateral procedures. Facial sweating during salivation has also been described in diabetes mellitus, cluster headache, following chorda tympani injury, and following facial herpes zoster. Phantom sweating is another form of autonomic neuropathy. It can be observed in patients with nerve damage (following accidents), diabetes mellitus and as a result of sympathectomy. Phantom sweating is a sensation that one is sweating, while the skin remains dry. Sufferers can not distinguish whether it is real sweating or just a sensation. The phenomena is experienced in the anhidriotic, denervated area of the body, presenting an abnormal sympathetic nervous system function. Wednesday, 21 August 2019 Mechanism The term 'compensatory' is largely misleading, as it indicates that there is a compensatory mechanism that takes effect after sympathectomy, in which the body 'redirects' the sweating from the palms or face to other areas of the body. Sweating after sympathetic surgery is a reflex cycle between the sympathetic system and the anterior portion of the hypothalamus. Reflex sweating will not happen if hand sweating can be stopped without interrupting sympathetic tone to the human brain.Chien- Chih Lin and Timo Telaranta at the 4th Symposium on Sympathetic Surgery in Vienna. Compensatory hyperhidrosis is aberrant sympathetic nervous system functioning. The only study evaluating the total body sweat prior and shortly after sympathectomy concluded that patients produce more sweat after the surgery, just not so much in the areas treated by the surgery. Epidemiology Of people that have a sympathectomy, it is impossible to predict who will end up with a more severe version of this disorder, as there is no link to gender, age or weight. There is no test or screening process that would enable doctors to predict who is more susceptible.

Paradigm is perhaps best known for its vehicle simulation games. Founded as a 3D computer graphics company in 1990, Paradigm primarily worked on realistic flight simulation technology for major space and aviation clients. The company got its start in game development when it was contacted by Nintendo in 1994 to aid in the creation of one of the Nintendo 64's launch titles, Pilotwings 64. The game was a critical and commercial success for the developer, causing the simulation and entertainment divisions of Paradigm to separate and focus on their respective products. The newly independent Paradigm Entertainment continued to develop for Nintendo's 64-bit console. After a short partnership with Video System, Paradigm was acquired as a wholly owned subsidiary of Infogrames in 2000 and began developing games for sixth-generation video game consoles. Paradigm was sold to THQ in 2006 and was ultimately closed in 2008. History Paradigm Simulation was founded in 1990 as a company based in Addison, Texas. It initially focused on creating commercial products for graphics developers, including military training simulations for pilots and ship captains and a lengthy client list that included the United States Department of Defense, The Walt Disney Company, NASA, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and McDonnell Douglas. Paradigm acted as a proponent of 3D computer graphics and virtual reality in the mid-1990s with its applications including the IRIS GL-based VisionWorks and the Performer-based Vega, which were used on Silicon Graphics workstations. Project sales for the company were $7 million in 1995, up from $3.5 million in 1994. During that time, the company frequented the annual Consumer Electronics Show, SIGGRAPH, and Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) conferences with its 3D technological demonstrations. Nintendo reportedly contacted Paradigm in 1994 after it co-developed a realistic flight simulator called \\"Hornet\\" with the entertainment company Magic Edge Inc. Through connections to Silicon Graphics, designers of the Nintendo 64, Paradigm worked for nine months starting that same year on a technology base for its own Nintendo 64 software. At E3 in May 1995, engineers from Paradigm aided Nintendo in polishing a demo of the Nintendo 64 shown for developers and distributors in a whisper suite. Paradigm partnered with Nintendo the following month to begin development on Pilotwings 64, one of the first games available for the new console worldwide. The game was a success for the company, accounting for half of its revenues by the beginning of 1997 and had sold over one million copies worldwide by February 1998. In May 1996, one month prior to the console's Japanese launch, Paradigm released a turnkey development bundle titled \\"Fusion 64\\". In March 1997, the entertainment wing was spun off to concentrate solely on video game production. The simulation division completed a merger with Multigen Inc. in October 1998 and was acquired by Computer Associates International Inc. in 2000. Multigen-Paradigm is now part of Presagis. In the early years as an independent studio, Paradigm Entertainment had a short, three-game partnership with the Japanese publisher Video System. The partnership ended with a lawsuit by the Texas-based developer against Video System regarding the latter's supposed breach of contract in the development and publishing of the flight simulator Harrier 2001. At the start of 1999, Paradigm announced another 3D rendering and development tool called \\"VisKit\\", which was intended for use in creating next- generation console games being ported to multiple systems. On June 29, 2000, Paradigm Entertainment was acquired by Infogrames Entertainment, SA for $19.5 million or up to 700,000 Infogrames shares. Paradigm began developing games for sixth-generation consoles (PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox, and Dreamcast) after its final Nintendo 64 release Duck Dodgers Starring Daffy Duck. Works released during this time include an enhanced remake of the classic arcade game Spy Hunter, motocross racing games, and games based on the Terminator and Mission: Impossible multimedia franchises. Following the stock market downturn, and in the light of poor game sales, Atari began to divest of its internal development studios in an effort to financially restructure. In spite of not having produced a profitable game in over six years, and a steady exodus of talent, Paradigm was sold in May 2006 to THQ. Although Paradigm's release Stuntman: Ignition and THQ's Juiced 2: Hot Import Nights were the parent company's top sellers in their release quarter, THQ reported overall financial losses of $16.3 million during the first half of its 2007 fiscal year. \\"While we have shipped more than 1 million units worldwide on each of these titles, this is significantly below our internal forecast\\", stated THQ's CEO Brian Farrell. \\"In both cases we did not receive our required game play mechanic and overall product quality targets. Quality matters and we missed the mark.\\" On November 3, 2008, the company officially ceased operations. Paradigm's general manager Dave Gatchel went on to serve the same position at THQ's studio in Montreal. The remaining staff relocated to other companies, such as Gearbox Software.

It stands about above its base, and about above the Martian datum, making it the third tallest Martian mountain in terms of relief and the fourth highest in elevation. Its diameter is about , with a summit caldera about across. It is flanked by the smaller volcanoes Hecates Tholus to the northeast, and Albor Tholus to the southeast. Discovery Elysium Mons was discovered in 1972 in images returned by the Mariner 9 orbiter. Terrestrial analog The terrestrial volcano Emi Koussi (in Chad) has been studied as an analog of Elysium Mons. The two shield volcanoes have summit calderas of similar size, but Elysium Mons is 3.5 times larger in diameter and 6 times higher than its counterpart on Earth. Possible source of nakhlites A 6.5 km diameter crater at 29.674 N, 130.799 E, in the volcanic plains to the northwest of Elysium Mons has been identified as a possible source for the nakhlite meteorites, a family of similar basaltic Martian meteorites with cosmogenic ages of about 10.7 Ma, suggesting ejection from Mars by a single impact event. The dates of the igneous rocks of the nakhlites range from 1416 ¬± 7 Ma to 1322 ¬± 10 Ma. These dates plus the crater dimensions suggest a growth rate of the source volcano during that interval of 0.4‚Äì0.7 m per Ma, far slower than would be expected for a terrestrial volcano. This implies that Martian volcanism had slowed greatly by that point in history.

He played as either a left back or left winger and represented Brazil at under-17 and under-20 levels and at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Personal life Aur√©lio was born on 24 September 1979 in S√£o Carlos, Brazil to parents Mario and Neide. He holds dual citizenship of both Brazil and Italy. He has one sister, who is married to fellow Brazilian footballer Edu. F√°bio married his wife Elaine in January 2000 and they have two children, F√°bio (born December 2001) and Victoria (born 2006). Club career =S√£o Paulo= Aur√©lio is an academy graduate of S√£o Paulo and made his senior debut for the club 1997, at the age of 17. During his time at the club, he made over 50 first team appearances and represented his native Brazil at both under-17 and under-20 levels, as well as at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. He was also part of the squads which ended as runners-up in the Campeonato Paulista in 1996 and 1997, and as champions in 1998 and 2000. =Valencia= Aur√©lio joined Spanish club Valencia after the 2000 Olympics on a six-year contract. The 2001‚Äì02 season would see his first major trophy win, when he helped Rafael Ben√≠tez's team to their first La Liga championship in 31 years. The next year, Aur√©lio established himself as one of the league's best left-backs after scoring eight league goals (ten in all competitions). The 2003‚Äì04 season was another big year for Valencia, winning both the domestic La Liga championship as well as the 2003‚Äì04 UEFA Cup, defeating Marseille 2‚Äì0 in the latter competition's final. Aur√©lio, however, missed most of the season with a broken leg, managing only two games. =Liverpool= Aur√©lio with Liverpool in August 2011. With his six-year contract having expired, Aur√©lio left Valencia to join English Premier League side Liverpool on a Bosman free transfer in July 2006, becoming the first Brazilian to sign for the club. He cited the chance to rejoin former manager Rafael Ben√≠tez as a key factor in his decision, telling the Liverpool Echo: > \\"I am going to a new club in which the trainer knows me, to see if I can > conquer the objectives I have set myself. The most important moments I had > in my career were the titles [with Valencia] and that was with Ben√≠tez. He > trusted me and he continues to trust me and that is what I value more.\\" On 5 July, the transfer was confirmed by Liverpool. Aur√©lio made his debut for the club in the FA Community Shield victory over Chelsea on 13 August and played a key part in Liverpool's squad during his first season, notably providing two assists for Peter Crouch and Daniel Agger in a 4‚Äì1 win over fellow title contenders Arsenal on 31 March 2007. Aur√©lio, however, soon suffered a setback as he injured his achilles tendon on 3 April in a UEFA Champions League first leg tie against PSV. He missed the remainder of Liverpool's 2006‚Äì07 season, meaning that he played only 25 games in his first year on Merseyside. He returned to action the following season on 18 September, coming on as a late substitute in a 1‚Äì1 draw against Porto in the Champions League group phase. Aur√©lio scored his first goal for Liverpool on 2 March 2008 in a Premier League match win against Bolton Wanderers at Reebok Stadium. The final score was 3‚Äì1, with Aur√©lio scoring Liverpool's third with a volley from a Xabi Alonso corner. Aur√©lio scored again on 7 February 2009 against Portsmouth at Fratton Park with a free-kick into the bottom corner, getting his team back on level terms and helping Liverpool towards a 3‚Äì2 victory. His next goal was the third in a 4‚Äì1 victory over perennial rivals Manchester United in March 2009. Aur√©lio went on to establish himself as Liverpool's first choice left-back but was again beset by injury. In the team's 1‚Äì1 draw with Chelsea in a Champions League semi-final first leg clash, Aur√©lio tore his adductor muscle after a forceful impact with Joe Cole and as a result was ruled out for the rest of the season. In the summer of 2009, while returning from the injury, he was injured playing beach football with his children. He returned a month into the season. Rafael Ben√≠tez confirmed on 25 May 2010 that Aur√©lio would leave Liverpool after rejecting a pay-as-you- play offer. Following a change of manager, on 1 August 2010, Aurelio re-signed for Liverpool on a two-year deal. He made his first appearance in his second spell for the club in a pre-season game against Borussia M√∂nchengladbach the day after re-signing, coming on as a substitute and wearing the captain's armband for the closing stages of the match. New Liverpool manager Roy Hodgson declared his delight at being able to re-sign Aur√©lio and, during an interview with the club's T.V channel, said, \\"I was quite surprised when I found out he was fully fit and hadn't been offered a new contract, so I think it was a bit of an obvious thing to do. I said, 'Rather than move to another Barclays Premier League club, why don't you stay with us?'\\" Aur√©lio opted to give up the number 12 shirt he wore prior to re-signing for the club back in July and chose the number 6 shirt instead because that is the one that he had worn when playing in Brazil; The number 12 shirt was passed to Dani Pacheco. Of his first four games in the 2010‚Äì11 season, three came in the UEFA Europa League. He then picked up an achilles injury before making his comeback as a substitute against West Ham United on 20 November 2010, in a match which Liverpool won 3‚Äì0. Aur√©lio played in Liverpool's FA Cup third round match that resulted in a 1‚Äì0 loss against Manchester United at Old Trafford on 9 January 2011. This was Kenny Dalglish's first match back in charge of Liverpool. On 11 April 2011, Aur√©lio returned from the injury to play in Liverpool's 3‚Äì0 home win over Manchester City. On 17 April 2011, he started at left back against Arsenal at Emirates Stadium, where he picked up a hamstring injury and was replaced by youngster Jack Robinson. Aur√©lio started Liverpool's last game of the 2010‚Äì11 season and Liverpool's final game of the pre-season against former club Valencia at Anfield, which Liverpool won 2‚Äì0. He started his first game of the 2011‚Äì12 season with a 5‚Äì1 win against League One Oldham Athletic in an FA Cup tie. He played 70 minutes before being replaced by Jon Flanagan. He made a substitute appearance for Liverpool against Wolverhampton Wanderers. On 12 May 2012, Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish revealed that Aur√©lio's contract was coming to an end and he would be leaving Liverpool at the end of the 2011‚Äì12 season after six seasons at the club. =Gr√™mio= On 24 May 2012, having only appeared twice in the Premier League the previous season, Aur√©lio returned to Brazil at the request of Vanderlei Luxemburgo to sign for Gr√™mio on a free transfer. However, his time at the club was marred by a torn cruciate ligament injury which saw him miss eight months of football, and he made only five appearances before announcing his retirement on 4 April 2014. Following his retirement, he revealed that he had been forced out of the club by chairman Fabio Koff after Luxemborgo had been sacked. Both Koff and club director, Rui Costa denied the allegations, alleging instead that he simply could not play anymore. International career Having previously represented them at under-17 and under-20 level, Aur√©lio played for the Brazil Olympic team at the Sydney Olympics in 2000. In October 2009, Aur√©lio was called into the Brazil senior team for friendly matches against England and Oman, but was not able to make his full debut as he had to withdraw from the squad due to injury.

The final toll was 24 dead including 16 children and 168 injured. The train did not catch fire, and many of the people trapped in the wreckage were later rescued alive. The crash was later determined to be the result of criminal damage to some railway signals and power lines, which meant that the passenger train failed to change track on its approach to the station, and piled into the stationary goods train on the original track. This damage was caused by unknown persons who stole copper wiring from the signal and power lines causing the signal and switcher to fail to respond when an operator tried to change them.

The Pallars own small bits of dry lands and do cultivation but to supplement their income they work as tenant agriculturists. The Pallars traditionally inhabited the fertile wetland area referred to as Marutham in the literary devices of the Sangam landscape. Etymology The Pallar name may be derived from pallam, which means a pit or low-lying area. This aligns with their traditional occupation of cultivators of the low wetlands. There is literary evidence that suggests that Pallars were traditional farmers who produced large quantities of food grains, and that some were probably rulers in the Tamil region. The name of the caste has previously been spelled as Pallan; however, some caste members replaced the Tamil non-honorific terminal-\\"n\\" with an honorific \\"r\\", resulting in the name Pallar; a similar process was seen in other Tamil communities. The change of name from Mallar to Pallar is thought to have been imposed upon them after the decline of their rule, when the leaders (Nayaks) of competing tribes wanted to suggest a degradation in status. Some Pallars today prefer the Mallar name due to their belief that Pallar is a derogatory term.  History  The Pallars traditionally inhabited the fertile wetland area referred to as Marutham in the literary devices of the Sangam landscape. Vendan, also known as Devendra and identified with Indra, is the god of the Marutham landscape and also one of the chief deities of the Pallars. According to some historians, the Pallars are descendants of the Pallavas who ruled the Andhra and Tamil countries between the 6th and 9th centuries; Pallars themselves may have ruled in the 14th-15th centuries. The socio-economic position of the Pallar as bonded servants working on farms is a central theme of Pallu poetry.  Modern social standing  Nowadays, community members prefer to refer to themselves as Devendra Kula Velalar (DKV), a name connoting that they were created by the god Devendra. In support of a name change to DKV, Pallars have undertaken hunger strikes and rallies. The Puthiya Tamilagam (PT) claims to have campaigned for the appellation of DKV to be applied to the Pallar, Kudumbar, Kaladi, Mooppan, Devendra Kulathan and Pannadi communities since the 1990s and between 2006-2011 a one-man commission looked into it on behalf of the state government, then controlled by the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK). Nothing came of the commission because the DMK lost power in 2011. The PT then allied with the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam in the hope that this would lead to the renaming but by 2015 had become frustrated with the inaction and was organising protests. In 2016, the national government, run by the Bharatiya Janata Party, announced it would appoint anthropologists to investigate the DKV claim in relation to the Pallar, Kudumbar, Pannadi, Kaladi, Kadayan, Devendra Kulathan and Vadhiriyar communities. It said that the decision was not motivated by a desire for political support from the affected communities but rather a reaction to a petition organised by the Thevendrar Thannarva Arakattalai (TTA) that had attracted over 500,000 signatories. Whilst the TTA said at the time that the change of name would have no effect on the Scheduled Caste status enjoyed by the communities under India's system of positive discrimination, by 2018 the PT leader, K. Krishnasamy, was demanding that they be removed from that classification. This announcement met with criticism, in part because it was claimed that Krishnasamy had only in the previous year become an advocate for the putative DVK communities and that previously he had been concerned more generally with Dalit politics. Doubts were expressed by Dalit intellectuals regarding whether Krishnasamy actually had the support of the majority of people from the affected communities for an idea which had originated with the Sangh Parivar and which, it was claimed, Krishnasamy was \\"latching on to\\" because he was \\"losing his political relevance\\". It was argued that the Vellalar term implied that the communities were adopting the sanskritisation process and that this would further emphasis caste divisions in a society that should be lessening them.

He states that he massacred all the Israelites at Ataroth as satisfaction for the blood lust of Chemosh and Moab. He adds that he captured Nebo (Ataroth) and killed everybody, 7,000 men, boys, women, girls, and maidens, because he had dedicated it to the goddess Ashtar-Chemosh. In the Bible, the name Ataroth refers to one of two or perhaps three towns: *A town east of the Jordan in Gilead, mentioned in Numbers, & , in the territory of the Tribe of Gad. Ataroth lay within the tribal allotment of Reuben, but was built up by the Gadites during the period of Israelite conquest. This is very probably Khirbat Ataruz, north of the Wadi Heidan. The Mesha Stele (Moabite Stone) is likely referring to this town. * A town west of the Jordan, mentioned in Joshua, , which describes the southern border of the children of Joseph (the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh). This southern border of Joseph would also be the southern border of Ephraim within Joseph, and also be the northern border of Benjamin. This Ataroth may be the same as Ataroth- Addar, mentioned in Joshua, , in a description of the border of Benjamin. A possible location is 'Atara, south of al-Bireh in the West Bank. Another is Khirbet ed-Darieh. * A town west of the Jordan, possibly the same as above, mentioned in Joshua, , which gives the borders of Ephraim within Joseph.

A January 2007 story in The Herald on Sunday estimated the New Zealand online DVD rental market at 15000 subscribers, with the implication that Movieshack was the smallest of the three major online DVD rental companies (the others being Fatso and DVD Unlimited). In June 2008, the company announced a merger with former competitors Fatso and DVD Unlimited. Screen Enterprises Limited was formed by merging the businesses of DVD Unlimited, Fatso and Movie Shack. According to the 2008 SKY Network Television annual report, the three firms were all struggling with the business model that has \\"yet to be accepted in New Zealand\\". SKY Network Television owns 51% of Screen Enterprises Limited and as such all subscribers are consolidated into SKY's results.

Like a number of other Cretaceous and living snakes it retained hindlimbs, but Najash is unusual in having well-developed legs that extend outside the rib cage, and a pelvis connected to the spine. Fossils of Najash were found in the terrestrial Candeleros Formation, in Rio Negro Province, Argentina, and date to roughly 90 million years ago. The skull and spine of Najash show primitive features that resemble other Cretaceous snakes, such as Dinilysia and Madtsoiidae. Also, several characteristics of the neck and tail of Najash and Dinilysia show how the body plan of snakes evolved from a lizard-like ancestor. Najash had not lost its sacrum, the pelvic bone composed of several fused vertebrae, nor its pelvic girdle, which are absent in modern snakes, and in all other known fossil snakes as well.Other known fossil snakes with developed hindlimbs, Haasiophis, Pachyrhachis and Eupodophis‚Äîall found in marine environments‚Äîall lack a sacral region. Nearly all phylogenetic analyses place Najash as an early shoot of the snake tree, outside of all living snakes.

Distributed by HDNet Films and released by Magnolia Pictures, the film stars Ayad Akhtar, Firdous Bamji, Nandana Sen and Sarita Choudhury. The War Within premiered at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival. Plot The War Within is the story of Hassan, a Pakistani engineering student in Paris, who is apprehended by American intelligence services for suspected terrorist activities. After his interrogation, Hassan undergoes a radical transformation and embarks upon a terrorist mission, surreptitiously entering the United States to join a cell based in New York City. After they have meticulously planned an event of maximum devastation, the members of the cell are arrested, except for Hassan, Khalid, and their cell leader Izzy. With no alternative and nowhere else to turn, Hassan must rely on the hospitality of his former best friend Sayeed, who is living the American dream with his family in New Jersey. To go forward and carry out his own attack, Hassan takes advantage of Sayeed's generosity while plotting his strategy and amassing materials to create explosives. Eventually, Hassan's skewed religious fervor clashes with his feelings for Sayeed and his family, especially Sayeed's young son Ali, his eight-year-old daughter Rasheeda, and Sayeed's sister Duri, with whom Hassan begins to fall in love. When Izzy is arrested, Khalid and Hassan decide to use the explosives in a suicide attack on Grand Central Station. Duri discovers Hassan mixing the explosives in her brother's house. When Sayeed tries to stop him, Hassan knocks him out and runs away. Duri follows Hassan to stop the attack. At the last minute, Khalid loses his nerve and Hassan goes to the target alone. Duri arrives at Grand Central Station just before Hassan detonates his explosive belt. After the attack, Sayeed is held by the police, who believe that he helped Hassan.

Castelo came up with the idea for the film after reading an article about a Palestinian suicide bomber. They approached both Miramax Films and Fine Line Features to finance the film, but both companies refused, citing the subject matter as too controversial for American audiences. The film was shot on location in New York City and Jersey City. Sameer Bajar and Afia Nathaniel provided the Urdu dialogues for the film. Reception The War Within received mainly positive reviews from critics. It has an aggregate rating of 72% on Rotten Tomatoes and 61 out of 100 on Metacritic. DVD release The DVD for The War Within was released on January 17, 2006. It features commentary by Joseph Castelo and Ayad Akhtar, 8 deleted scenes and an alternate beginning.

The song is a nostalgic reflection sung from the viewpoint of a man who rejects reality in favour of the nostalgia he felt towards the fantasy world of the girls in Walt Disney movies and television shows, songs by Patti Page and the days he made wine in his garage, enjoying lemonade in the country shade. \\"Disney Girls (1957)\\" has proven to be one of Bruce Johnston's most enduring songs, still occasionally performed by The Beach Boys in concert. It has been covered by many artists, including Art Garfunkel, Cass Elliott, Alexander Rybak, Doris Day, Jack Jones and Captain & Tennille. Elliot's version (from the album Cass Elliot) features Johnston and Carl Wilson. It is rumoured that The Byrds' Gene Clark has recorded it but his version remains unreleased. The song has long been Johnston's solo spot during Beach Boys live shows.

She made her first appearance during the episode broadcast on 19 July 2002. Sindi was initially a recurring character, before she was promoted to the regular cast. Her storylines often focused on her romantic relationships, including her affair with Rocco Cammeniti (Robert Forza) and marriage to Stuart Parker (Blair McDonough). She also attempted to break up Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney) and Dee Bliss (Madeleine West), and briefly became a lapdancer to raise much needed money. The character was written out in May 2005 and she departed on 26 August 2005. In January 2017, it was announced that Warrington had reprised her role, and Sindi returned on 7 February. She was revealed to be involved in a scam with Andrea Somers (Madeleine West). The following year saw the character make a brief appearance on 12 February 2018, before returning for a longer guest stint from 26 June until 2 August 2018. Development =Characterisation= Warrington joined the cast in 2002 and she described her character as \\"one- part stalker, one-part lunatic.\\" Warrington told the BBC that she enjoyed playing the \\"evil\\" Sindi that tried to break up Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney) and Dee Bliss (Madeleine West). But she later admitted that she initially found her character annoying, stating \\"She rubbed people up the wrong way, and I didn't like her!\\" The writers changed Sindi's persona for her 2003 reintroduction. She became a lot nicer and more fun. Warrington said that Sindi was also more \\"dippy\\", adding \\"the current Sindi character is incredibly sweet and honest, she has a lot of good points.\\" =Relationships= Jack Scully (Jay Bunyan) becomes interested in Sindi and he goes to Toadie for advice on how to win her over. However, Toadie is resentful of Jack, as he likes Sindi too. Toadie struggles to admit to himself that he has feelings for Sindi because he is in mourning for his late wife, Dee. Warrington explained the situation, \\"This is the point at which Toadie starts to become interested in Sindi, but just because he's not ready to reveal his feelings, he doesn't want anyone else to go after her either. There's a nice little love triangle that develops.\\" Sindi and Toadie begin a brief relationship, but they break up because Toadie still loves Dee. Sindi leaves town for a while, but when she returns she tells Lyn Scully (Janet Andrewartha) that she is in a relationship with a married man. She explains that she has been trying to stop it, but she has trouble going through with it. Lyn disapproves, but she supports Sindi. When Sindi's feelings for Toadie resurface, she decides to end her relationship with the man she calls \\"Tiny.\\" It is then revealed that Sindi is having an affair with criminal Rocco Cammeniti (Robert Forza). Warrington admitted that Sindi's friends would be shocked to learn who she is dating. Toadie realises that he cares deeply for Sindi and she tries again to break off her relationship with Rocco. However, she is left stunned when Rocco tells her that he has left his wife and gives her an engagement ring. Warrington said, \\"Sindi can't admit to Rocco that she's in love with someone else, and she's also worried that something will happen to Toadie if she tells Rocco who she is in love with. So she uses the excuse that she doesn't want to be Rocco's secret 'other woman' anymore.\\" However, Rocco then chooses that moment to give Sindi an engagement ring, which she has to accept. She later tells Toadie that she loves him and they agree to start their relationship again. Sindi finally manages to end her relationship with Rocco to start a new life with Toadie, but she is unaware that Rocco has hired someone to spy on her. Rocco is not happy when he is given photos of Sindi and Toadie together, and Warrington commented that he \\"goes a bit crazy\\" as he believes Sindi is his girl. When she was asked what it was like to date someone like Rocco, who is nearly twice her age, Warrington replied \\"Robert, who plays Rocco is a lovely guy, so it was fine. However, I must confess, when I was about 24 I briefly dated a man who was in his 40s and I have to say that it did look a bit wrong! He looked like my uncle!\\" When her boyfriend, Stuart Parker (Blair McDonough), is left blind following a fire, Sindi turns to exotic dancing to raise money. Warrington explained that Sindi feel responsible for Stuart's condition because he went into the fire to rescue her. She also likes that he is now dependent on her, as she is a needy person and she loves him. Sindi has no choice but to return to her previous profession, as other career prospects are non-existent, but she keeps it a secret. Of this, Warrington told Inside Soap's Jason Herbison: \\"Sindi goes back to exotic dancing ‚Äì something she always swore she would never do again. She hates it and is so ashamed that she doesn't tell anyone. But that's the kind of character Sindi is. She's a doormat!\\" At the end of a shift, Sindi is offered the chance to make more money by prostituting herself. Warrington said that although Sindi says no, she is tempted by the money. The character's resolve is tested when Stuart starts seeing colours and a specialist informs him that surgery would cost $50,000. Sindi knows how they can get the money and seriously considers turning to prostitution. Warrington said that Sindi wants to be with Stuart forever, so she knows that she would be doing it for their future. Stuart and Sindi became engaged in 2005 and they begin planning for their wedding. However, Toadie becomes suspicious that something is wrong with Sindi and that she \\"may not be all she's cracked up to be.\\" He confronts her at the wedding ceremony, but Stuart punches him and he and Sindi marry. =Departure= In May 2005, it was announced that Warrington's character would be written out of the show in a \\"surprise shake-up\\" of the cast. Actors Kevin Harrington (David Bishop) and Marcella Russo (Liljana Bishop) were also told their contracts were not being renewed, as producers sought actors to form a new family for the show. Warrington had 18 months left on her contract and expressed her disappointment at leaving the show, after she worked on making her character \\"more appealing\\" to conservative viewers. =Returns= On 24 January 2017, Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy announced that Warrington had reprised her role and would be returning to Neighbours for a guest stint from 7 February. Sindi's return was part of a storyline surrounding the reappearance of Dee Bliss. After arriving in Erinsborough, Sindi tells Toadie that she heard the news about Dee being alive, so she had to come and see for herself. Toadie's wife Sonya Rebecchi (Eve Morey) is suspicious of Sindi, and Morey stated \\"Sonya finds it all a bit strange ‚Äì first there was Dee, now Sindi! Why have they both turned up now? Also Dee makes out that the two of them are friends, but from what Toadie has told Sonya, Dee and Sindi were definitely not mates!\\" The woman claiming to be Dee is revealed to be a con artist named Andrea Somers (West), and it soon emerges that Sindi is her accomplice. Scenes between the two characters explained that Sindi met Andrea when they worked at a catering kitchen together and she told her that she looked like Dee Bliss. They then came up with a plan to claim money from the Bliss family estate, with Sindi asking for $20,000 in exchange for her help. Sindi later poses as Dee's saviour Emily on the phone to the police, leading her to increase her share of the money to $40,000. Warrington reprised the role again, along with several other returning cast members, for a feature-length special episode, which first aired on 12 February 2018. The episode centres on a belated 21st birthday party for Toadie. As Toadie leaves his party, he is surprised to meet a \\"bitter\\" Sindi, who reveals that Andrea is back in Australia. She then gives Toadie a phone number for Andrea. Sindi returned for a guest stint from 26 June, until 2 August 2018. Storylines =2002‚Äì2005= Sindi meets Darcy Tyler (Mark Raffety) at Lassiter's and there is an attraction between them. Darcy later treats Sindi's hurt ankle, but does not pursue anything further as he is dating her sister Penny (Andrea McEwan). Sindi seizes the opportunity to blackmail Darcy by threatening to tell Penny about his flirting with her unless he gives into her demands which include paying for clothes and shoes. Penny sees the pair together one day and as revenge reports Darcy to the medical board for having an affair with a patient. Sindi soon leaves Erinsborough. The following year, Sindi crosses paths with Darcy again and is used as a pawn in his game to drive a wedge between Toadfish Rebecchi and Dee Bliss, in order for Darcy to win Dee back. Sindi goes through with the plan by flirting with Toadie, but ends up falling for him for real. Darcy is annoyed, but Sindi threatens to expose his dubious dealings. When Sindi leaves an earring behind and goes to retrieve it from Toadie's house, she meets Dee, who assumes Sindi has moved in. Sindi tries to explain, but Dee leaves before she can. Several months later, Sindi returns when Tim Collins (Ben Anderson), Toadie's colleague, hires her to work at their legal practice. Things are awkward at first, but Sindi settles in the job and she and Toadie remain amicable. As the amount of time they spend together increases, Sindi reveals she still loves Toadie, but he is not over Dee who drowned several months previously in a car crash on their wedding day. Sindi leaves once again. Sindi returns as the director, producer and host of Making Mansions, a home make over show. She chooses the Scully family's house as the venue to be redesigned. Things do not work out as Sindi manages to insult her crew, prompting them to walk out on her. Luckily, several friends and neighbours help her and the work is eventually completed. Sindi becomes a resident herself of Ramsay Street when she lodges with Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne). Toadie and Sindi begin a relationship, but not without obstacles including the revelation of Sindi's previous affair with Rocco Cammeniti and his refusal to let her go, which results in Toadie being kidnapped and ending up in a brief coma. Sindi is a strong support for Toadie when he briefly takes on guardianship of his cousin Stingray Timmins (Ben Nicholas), before Stingray moves in with Sindi and Susan. However, Toadie still struggles with the idea of commitment so soon after Dee's death, and during a low patch Sindi shares an unexpected kiss with Toadie's friend and housemate Stuart Parker (Blair McDonough). She confesses all to Toadie after he asks her to move into Number 30, and their relationship soon ends. Sindi and Stuart are caught up in a bank raid and held hostage by gunmen. Although the situation is resolved peacefully, the trauma brings Sindi and Stuart together and they begin seeing each other in secret. The Lassiters complex is set on fire by Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis), and Sindi becomes trapped inside Lou's Place. Stuart runs in to save her, but he too becomes trapped and passes out due to smoke inhalation. After the building collapses entirely, the firefighters are about to give up looking for them in the wreckage, until Sindi manages to call Toadie. She and Stuart are rescued, but Stuart is left blind. Toadie realises that Sindi is in love with Stuart, and reluctantly gives his blessing to the relationship. Sindi discovers that an operation to restore Stuart's sight will cost $50,000, and in desperation tries to raise the money by selling her body. Her only client, Gary Evans (Ian Scott) gives her the money after he loses a coin toss. Stuart refuses to accept the money after realising how it was obtained, and Sindi instead donates it to Harold Bishop (Ian Smith) for the Salvation Army. A guilty Paul later offers to pay for the operation from his charity, the Helen Daniels Trust fund, although neither Sindi or Stuart are aware of his involvement in the fire. Sindi and Stuart are happy in their relationship for a while, before a run of odd events start happening around them. Sindi loses her job at All Her Magazine and she is later snubbed at a school reunion by her old classmates. Several of their friends and neighbours suffer mysterious accidents, including Susan, Liljana Bishop (Marcella Russo), and Janae Timmins (Eliza Taylor) - coincidentally all after upsetting Sindi in some way. Trent Hoffa, a colleague competing with Stuart for a promotion, is also run over by a mystery driver. In the meantime Sindi proposes to Stuart, and the two have a whirlwind engagement. Toadie links the numerous accidents with Sindi's increasingly bizarre behaviour, and worried for Stuart's safety, tries to halt the wedding ceremony. Stuart punches Toadie, and the wedding goes ahead, but Stuart realises the truth when he later sees an unhinged Sindi push Toadie down a flight of stairs. Hospitalised, it emerges that Sindi has been suffering from paranoid delusions, and had received treatment in her teens after pushing schoolmate Kelly Weaver (Simone Ray) down some stairs, leaving her paralysed. A broken Sindi asks Stuart for an annulment, with her doctors advising that her obsession for a perfect married life was a trigger. Stuart refuses the annulment but agrees to a temporary break while she recovers, and she is transferred to a clinic in New South Wales. Almost a year later, Sindi agrees to join Stuart for a new start in Oakey as he leaves Ramsay Street. =2017‚Äì2018= Sindi and Stuart later divorce. While working in a kitchen, she meets Andrea Somers (also Madeleine West), and they concoct a plan where Andrea poses as her lookalike, the presumed dead Dee Bliss, to scam Toadie. She eventually returns to Erinsborough and tells Andrea she regrets her part in the scam, but demands her share of the money to be increased. Weeks later, Sindi returns to the news that Andrea has conned Toadie out of $100,000 and fled to London. Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne) reads Sindi's texts and discovers Andrea's true identity. A panicked Sindi then leaves town. Nearly a year later, Sindi returns to Erinsborough to give Toadie Andrea's phone number. Months later, Sindi brings Andrea's infant son Hugo Somers (John Turner) to Ramsay Street, and breaks the news that Toadie is Hugo's father. Gary Canning (Damien Richardson) gives Sindi a job at The Flametree Retreat. While returning to the retreat to make sure she locked up, Sindi is confronted by Jeremy Sluggett (Tamblyn Lord), who demands her keys so he can retrieve a bag of money from a drawer. Sindi manages to contact the police, and Jeremy knocks her unconscious as he escapes. While Amy is visiting Sindi, she tells her about a job offer as a sales manager in Sydney. Sindi is reluctant to accept as she wants to makes amends to Sonya and Toadie, but Sonya gives Sindi her blessing. Sindi comes to Ramsay Street to say her goodbyes and Toadie asks if she ever told Andrea about his first kiss with Dee, but Sindi tells him that she did not mention it. Reception When Sindi's cousin, Lana Crawford (Bridget Neval), came out to her, a Sydney Star Observer reporter called Sindi \\"sympathetic\\" and said her nice reaction to Lana's news was \\"good to see.\\" A writer for the BBC's Neighbours website said Sindi's most notable moments were \\"Dating Toadie for money. Acting like a bogan to put Rocco off. The Making Mansions fiasco.\\" Fergus Sheil of The Age said: \\"Sindi Watts knows that dishonesty, a meditation tape and a lavender wheat bag should be an integral part of any intimate relationship, and that's why we love her to bits.\\" Billy Sloan of the Sunday Mail branded the character \\"disaster-prone\\". A TV Soap reporter branded Sindi a \\"slightly unhinged material girl\\" and said she took \\"drastic steps\\" during her time on the show.

It was written by Brian Wilson and Mike Love and later issued as an A-sided single in March 1971. The song evolved from \\"Love to Say Dada\\", an unfinished composition from the band's cancelled Smile album. \\"Cool, Cool Water\\" was first attempted during sessions for the 1967 albums Smiley Smile and Wild Honey. At the insistence of A&R; man Lenny Waronker, the song was completed for Sunflower, with synthesizer contributions from Beaver & Krause. Composition Engineer Stephen Desper has said that \\"Cool, Cool Water\\" was stuck in Brian's head \\"for years\\", and that the song had branched from an earlier composition entitled \\"I Love to Say Dada\\". The chord progression and melodic hooks are almost identical to it, and tracks from both \\"Cool, Cool Water\\" and \\"Love To Say Dada\\" sessions are paired side-by-side in The Smile Sessions box set. Brian later stated: Recording \\"Cool, Cool Water\\" was first attempted in June 1967 and October 1967 during the sessions for the Smiley Smile and Wild Honey albums.The Smile Sessions, 2011 liner notes and session tracks. The 1967 recording did not make it to the final track listing of these albums and was discarded. Three years later, Lenny Waronker, then an A&R; executive at Warner Music, heard the unfinished tape, and convinced Wilson to finish the track for Sunflower. Waronker was impressed with the song's inspired simplicity and stated \\"If I ever get the opportunity to produce Brian, I'd encourage him to do something that combined the vividness of 'Good Vibrations' with the non-commercial gentleness of 'Cool, Cool Water'.\\" A revised version of \\"Cool, Cool Water\\" was released on their 1970 album Sunflower, featuring new lyrics by Mike Love and an altered arrangement. \\"Cool, Cool Water\\" was also released as an edited single, with the B-side of the single being \\"Forever\\". The single failed to chart in the US and in the UK. The truncated single edit was released in 2007, on the group's The Warmth of the Sun compilation. The \\"Water Chant\\" segment first attempted during the late-1967 Wild Honey sessions also features as the intro to the Brian Wilson Presents Smile version of \\"Love to Say Dada\\" (renamed \\"In Blue Hawaii\\").

In response to competition from high- volume retail stores, Sloan believed \\"that programmed distribution through a cooperative alliance would be the most effective means to remain competitive.\\" According to a 1994 Bangor Daily News article, \\"CARQUEST is made up of 14 distributing companies operating 64 CARQUEST Auto Parts Stores throughout the United States\\" at that time. General Parts was the largest member with General Parts owning 1,400 out of CarQuest‚Äôs 3,400 auto parts stores across North America by 2011. O. Temple Sloan Jr. started General Parts in 1961. Founding member Bobro was later sold to White Plains Automotive in 1984 and renamed B.W.P. Distributors. BWP was later acquired by Advance Auto in 2012. Dan Bock later served as president of Carquest. Founding member Indiana Parts Warehouse was acquired by the third founder General Parts in 1991. Indiana Parts had served 90 locations. Carquest acquired Worldpac in 2004, but kept its operations separate. General Parts received $258 million in 2011 for selling 33 of the company‚Äôs distribution centers and office buildings in a long-term sale-leaseback deal. In June 2012, Carquest Auto Parts relaunched its Carquest.com Web site, offering buy online, pick up in store commerce. In December 2012, Advance Auto Parts acquired warehouse distributor B.W.P.

Lysianskyi was born in Nizhyn (now Ukraine, then Russian Empire) in the family of the orthodox priest and was a descendant of old Cossack family. In 1786 he graduated from the Navy Cadet Corps and took part in the Russo-Swedish War (1788-1790). During 1790-1793 he served in the Baltic Fleet. During 1793-1799 he sailed British ships all over the globe. Between 1793 and 1795 he served as a volunteer aboard the 36-gun HMS Oiseau, under her captain, Robert Murray. Lysianskyi recalled in his memoirs his experiences on the North American Station operating against French convoys and privateers, and how while in the West Indies he was struck by yellow fever, recalling how Murray had helped his recovery, even giving up part of his own accommodation for the sick Lysianskyi. In 1803-1806 Lysianskyi as the commanding officer of the Russian- American Company's merchant sloop Neva took part in the first Russian circumnavigation of the Earth. The expedition was under the command of Count Nikolay Petrovich Rezanov, Plentipotentiary of Alexander I for the Far Eastern and Western colonies of the Russian Empire, and Captain Adam Johann von Krusenstern in Nadezhda. They started from Kronstadt, but the ships split after visiting Hawaii, and Count Nikolay Rezanov and Lysianskyi headed to Russian America (Alaska). In 1804 Neva visited Easter Island,Katherine Routledge refers to page 58 of his book \\"Voyage round the world in the Ship Neva Lysianskyi\\", London 1814. and later that year, was essential in defeating the Tlingit in the Battle of Sitka, Alaska. In 1805 he met Krusenstern again in Macau, but they soon separated. Also in 1805, he was the first to describe the Hawaiian monk seal on the island which now bears his name.Monachus Guardian Eventually, Neva was the first to return to Kronstadt on 22 July 1806. For his feats Lysianskyi received several rewards, including the Order of Saint Vladimir of 3rd degree. Lysianskyi's grave Lysianskyi was buried at Tikhvin Cemetery of the Alexander Nevsky Monastery, St. Petersburg. Memorials A number of places are named after him: Lisianski Island in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, a peninsula of Baranof Island, Alaska, a bay, a strait, a river, and a cape in North America, an undersea mountain in Okhotsk Sea, and a peninsula by the Okhotsk Sea.

He led his own engineering company in Chur from 1957‚Äì1971. From 1971 until his retirement in 1992, he was a professor of structural engineering at ETH Zurich, specializing in bridge design. In his retirement years, he continued to be a consulting engineer in private practice.  Education and practical training  Born in Meiringen, Canton of Bern, Menn graduated from high school (Kantonsschule Chur) in 1946, followed by structural engineering studies at ETH Zurich. He received a diploma as Bauingenieur (civil engineer) in 1950. From 1950 through 1953 he worked for construction engineering companies. Then, he returned to ETH Zurich to become assistant to Pierre Lardy, a well-known professor of structural engineering, and was awarded a PhD degree in 1956. He gained practical experience working for companies in Paris and Bern before starting his own consulting company in 1957.  Design philosophy  Menn‚Äôs bridges had to be designed for the times: \\"Structural Analysis found itself at the time in the transition from descriptive graphical analysis to abstract analytical statics\\". (Menn, 2002) Menn worked very closely with Pierre Lardy during the beginning of his career, emphasizing the design of structures based on aesthetics and economy. Menn believed that economy, serviceability and safety of the bridge would revolve around aesthetics. Menn has stated that an engineer achieves safety and serviceability by understanding the underlying scientific principles, but that economy and elegance are achieved through non- scientific ideas. An engineer must also have aesthetic creativity. Menn describes his bridges with abstract theoretical models which allow him to analyze bridges and find stresses and distribution of forces within the structure. Building on this framework, he is able to devise numerical calculations which can eventually be used in computer modeling of the structures.  Swiss tourism  The important role of tourism in the Swiss economy has a strong influence on the types of bridges that are constructed. When choosing a bridge design, Swiss leaders prioritize the aesthetic characteristics of a bridge more highly than a country that is less tourism- driven. The need for visually appealing bridges afforded bridge designer Menn with a great opportunity. His use of pre-stressed concrete and the implementation of cable-stayed bridge decks give his designs great aesthetic appeal.  Professional organizations  Christian Menn was a member of the Swiss Society of Civil Engineers (SIA), the Swiss Trade Group for Bridge and Building Engineering, International Association for Bridge and Structural Engineering (IABSE), and Swiss Code-Committee for Reinforced and Prestressed Concrete Structures. Before retirement, he was a member of the ETH research committee.  Awards  Christian Menn was awarded the 2009 IABSE International Award of Merit in Structural Engineering, and the Sunniberg Bridge won the 2001 IABSE Outstanding Structure Award.  Influence  In spring 1979, Menn supervised a thesis on a bridge over the Acleta gorge close to Disentis in the Grisons by a young Santiago Calatrava, as he completed his studies in Civil Engineering at ETH Zurich. That same year, Menn also asked Calatrava to provide sketches for a bridge on tall pylons to cross a deep valley, and these sketches by Calatrava in 1979 containing finback and extradosed solutions were finally published in 2004. Menn worked with a young Miguel Rosales on the Leonard P. Zakim Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge, completed in 2003, as part of the massive \\"Big Dig\\" project in Boston. This highly- visible structure has become an iconic landmark in the Boston skyline, and helped launch Rosales' career as a bridge designer, carrying the older designer's philosophy into the next generation of structural designers.

He made his first appearance during the episode broadcast on 13 December 2001. Stuart lived with Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney) and Connor O'Neill (Patrick Harvey) at number 30, during which time the house became known as \\"The House of Trouser\\". Stuart's storylines included becoming a policeman, temporarily losing his eyesight, joining a cult, which almost cost him his friendships, and marrying Sindi Watts (Marisa Warrington). Stuart departed on 5 April 2006 after McDonough quit to pursue other projects. The actor reprised the role for three episodes from 13 February until 15 February 2018. Casting In 2001, McDonough became a runner-up in the first series of Australian Big Brother. His \\"good looks and down-to-earth personality\\" attracted the attention of the Neighbours' producers. McDonough had to audition for the role of Stuart. He was offered the part, which was initially for three months. McDonough began filming with the show in August 2001. Shortly before his debut episode aired, he had his three-month contract extended to six months. This was then extended to one year. Development =Characterisation and introduction= McDonough found that he was very similar to Stuart. He told Jason Herbison of Inside Soap, \\"There's a lot of him in me. He's a fairly straightforward guy, who's just out to have a good time.\\" McDonough also said that he and his character were both from the country, but Stuart was more naive than he was. Stuart, or \\"Chooka\\" as he is nicknamed, comes from Oakey, the home town of fellow Neighbours character Drew Kirk (Dan Paris). He is introduced as the younger brother of one of Drew's friends. He first appears at the Oakey Rodeo, where Drew is competing. A week later, Stuart follows Drew to Erinsborough, and McDonough said Stuart plans on \\"making a name for himself in the big smoke.\\" Stuart immediately wins people over with his \\"country charm\\". =Departure and return= McDonough quit the show in October 2005 after four years to move to the UK. A spokeswoman said \\"It was an enormous opportunity... and he's a bit sad leaving Ramsay Street because he's had a great time. But it's time to move on.\\" In January 2018, it was announced that McDonough had reprised his role. Executive producer Jason Herbison stated that Stuart will return to Erinsborough for a celebration which allows him to \\"reconnect with an old friend\\". Further details about the character's return were revealed on 17 January. Along with several other returning cast members, McDonough appeared in a feature-length special episode, which aired on 12 February 2018. The episode centres on a belated 21st birthday party for Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney). Storylines Stuart turns up in Erinsborough and his friend, Drew Kirk allows him to stay with him and his wife Libby Kennedy (Kym Valentine). Stuart secures a job at Carpenter Mechanics. Stuart begins a relationship with Dee Bliss (Madeleine West) and she invites him to move into Number 30. Stuart's ex-fianc√©e, Tracey Slattery (Christine Wools) shows up in Ramsay Street and Stuart explains that she cheated on him on the eve of their wedding. Upon Tracey's departure, Stuart and Dee break up. Stuart then develops feelings for Felicity Scully (Holly Valance). Stuart joins the army, but he is not happy and decides to take a job as a hospital porter instead. Following Drew's death, Stuart promises Libby that he will be there for her and he quits his job at the hospital. Shortly after becoming a couple, Felicity tells Stuart that she is leaving for New York. Stuart proposes to her and she accepts. Once Felicity leaves, Stuart begins spending time with Libby and her son, Ben Kirk (Noah Sutherland). Stuart later admits that he made a mistake getting engaged and calls Felicity to tell her that their relationship is over. Stuart finds the garage hard to run by himself, and he employs Stephanie Scully (Carla Bonner). Stuart is accused of causing Dee's death when the car Toadie was driving on their wedding day is not deemed roadworthy. Stuart meets Jonathan Verne (Oscar Redding) at a festival and he tells him about his group, Life Mechanics. Stuart joins the group and ignores his friends who say he is joining a cult. He begins spending more time with Jonathan and he starts running his own meetings. His friends turn against him. It soon emerges that Jonathan has been conning people out of money nationwide. Stuart retreats away from everyone for a while, before making amends. Stuart applies to be a police officer. On his first day, Stuart is partnered with Olivia McPherson (Silvia de Crespigny), they get on well and Stuart develops a crush on her. However, when he discovers she is corrupt, he reports her. Stuart fails to get on well with Toadie's new girlfriend, Sindi Watts (Marisa Warrington), but during an argument, they kiss. Sindi tells Toadie, and they stay together. When Toadie breaks up with her, Stuart and Sindi begin a secret relationship. During a fire at the pub, Stuart tries to rescue Sindi, but the pub collapses and traps them. When they are rescued, Stuart is found to have severe injuries to his eyes. The Helen Daniels Trust donates money to Stuart so he can have an operation to fix his sight. Stuart grows suspicious about Sindi's behaviour when his friends begin to get injured. Liljana Bishop (Marcella Russo) slips off a ladder and Susan Kennedy (Jackie Kennedy) hits her head on a cupboard door, while Sindi is around. Sindi tells Stuart that she is jinxed and goes through hypnotherapy treatment. Sindi proposes to Stuart, who accepts. Stuart grow suspicious of Sindi again when he learns that his friend, Trent Hoffa (Todd Scoullar) was hit by a car. After confronting Sindi, Stuart is forced to apologise when Trent wakes up and says the driver had dark hair and glasses. Sindi shows up at Stuart's bucks' night, but when Toadie claims to have seen her, Stuart does not believe him. On the day of the wedding, Toadie finds evidence that proves Sindi was there. However, he knocks himself out and Sindi takes the evidence. Upon waking, Toadie goes to the church and tries to stop the ceremony. Stuart punches him and he and Sindi marry. Toadie turns up during the honeymoon with the evidence about Sindi. Stuart witnesses Sindi pushing Toadie down some stairs and realises that Toadie was right. Sindi is taken to a psychiatric ward and Stuart vows to stand by her. Sindi asks for an annulment and tells him that she is transferring to another clinic. When Stuart's father hurts his back and is unable to work, Stuart argues with his brother, Ned Parker (Dan O'Connor), about which one of them will return home to help out. Stuart puts his sergeant's exam on hold and calls Sindi to ask if she would join him in Oakey. She agrees and he departs Ramsay Street with Angie (Lesley Baker) and Kevin Rebecchi (Don Bridges). Stuart returns to Erinsborough for Toadie's belated 21st party. He tells Toadie that Angie, Kev and his brother Stonefish Rebecchi (Anthony Engelman) are now coming to the party. Along with Lance Wilkinson (Andrew Bibby), Stuart, Stonie and Toadie dress as the Teletubbies for the party. Sindi repeatedly calls Stuart, but he ignores her and decides not to tell Toadie. Stuart makes a speech mentioning Toadie's romantic troubles with Sindi and con artist Andrea Somers (Madeleine West), causing Toadie to leave the party. Stuart follows him outside, and finds Sindi has come to tell Toadie that Andrea is back. Stuart catches up with Steph and tells her that his marriage to Sindi ended as she had a lot of issues to work through. Toadie apologises to Stuart for being busy with work, and they spend the afternoon together. After buying burgers from Grease Monkeys, Stuart notices the garage across the road and remarks that it has not changed. He notices the mechanic and Toadie introduces him as Ben (now Felix Mallard), Drew and Libby's son. Toadie persuades Ben to shut up the garage for the day and join him and Stuart at Number 30. Steph joins them in a game of truth or dare. Stuart tells Ben that he became a mechanic because of Drew and they all reminisce about him. Reception For his portrayal of Stuart, McDonough received a nomination for the Logie Award for Most Popular New Male Talent in 2002. He also earned a nomination for Sexiest Male at the 2003 Inside Soap Awards. Michael Idato of The Sydney Morning Herald praised McDonough's performance during his debut, writing \\"He is, in fact, a surprise: a perfectly adequate performer, considering he comes with no formal qualification in drama.\\" Nick Levine of media and entertainment website Digital Spy included McDonough in a picture feature of the \\"sexiest male soap stars from the last ten years.\\" A writer for the BBC's Neighbours website said Stuart's most memorable moments were \\"helping Flick through her problems with Marc and Steph\\" and \\"being blamed by Toadie for Dee's death.\\" References External links *Stuart Parker at BBC Online Category:Neighbours characters Category:Fictional Australian police officers Category:Fictional chauffeurs Category:Fictional mechanics Category:Fictional privates Category:Television characters introduced in 2001 Category:Male characters in television ","title":"Stuart Parker (Neighbours)"},{"id":"4815181","text":"The Loibl Pass () or Ljubelj Pass () is a high mountain pass in the Karawanks chain of the Southern Limestone Alps, linking Austria with Slovenia. The Loibl Pass road is the shortest connection between the Carinthian town of Ferlach and Tr≈æiƒç in Upper Carniola and part of the European route E652 from Klagenfurt to Naklo. Geography Loibl Tunnel and historic pass road The mountain pass is located just on the Austrian-Slovenian border at 1,367 metres above the Adriatic (4,485 ft), east of the Stol massif. The mountain road (Loiblpass Stra√üe, B 91), one of the steepest in the Eastern Alps, winds up from the broad Drava valley in numerous hairpin curves to the top of the pass, parallel to the Loiblbach brook and the picturesque Tscheppa (ƒåepa) gorge with several waterfalls. From the Kleiner Loibl (Sapotnica) pass, a small road branches off to the remote Bodental valley. Since 1963-64 the traffic passes through a two-lane tunnel at underneath the mountain crest. South of the pass, the road (No. 101) runs down via Podljubelj to Tr≈æiƒç in the Sava valley and further to the A2 motorway. Nearby mountain passes are Wurzen Pass in the west and Seeberg Saddle in the east. Formerly one of the most important road connections between the Carinthian capital Klagenfurt and Kranj in Carniola, the significance of Loibl Pass has diminished since 1991, when the long Karawanken Motorway Tunnel, connecting the Austrian Karawanken Autobahn (A 11) from Villach with the Slovenian A2 motorway to Ljubljana, was opened. Today the pass road is closed for heavy traffic. Border controls were abolished when Slovenia joined the Schengen Area effective from 21 December 2007, but have been restored temporarily for entry to Austria in the wake of an increased number of illegal border crossings during the \\"European migrant crisis\\" of 2015-2016. History Different trails were used since ancient times, connecting Virunum in the Roman province of Noricum with Emona (at present-day Ljubljana). In medieval times, the strategic importance of Loibl Pass increased again, when in the 11th century Emperor Henry III separated the southeastern March of Carniola from the Carinthia. The Patriarchs of Aquileia, governing the margraviate from 1077, entrusted the maintenance of the pass road to the Cistercian monks of newly established Viktring Abbey, who had a hospitium and a chapel dedicated to Saint Leonard erected. Nevertheless, the monks had to rival with claims raised by the local Lords of Hollenburg (Humberk) Castle, who took over the possessions by 1488. Since 1335, both the Carinthian and Carniolan Imperial estates in the north and south were ruled by the Habsburg dukes of Austria. Road and tunnel \\"over and through Loibl Berg\\", engraving by Johann Weikhard von Valvasor, 1679 The pass became an important trade route after the City of Trieste went under the umbrella of the Habsburg archdukes in the late 14th century. From about 1560 the Carinthian estates had the former bridle path extended and a 150 m (500 ft) long tunnel built underneath the Karawanks ridge, an early example of modern engineering that later had to be removed due to lack of safety. Another attempt was planned in the 17th century; however, when in 1728 Emperor Charles VI toured the lands of the Habsburg Monarchy, he still had to travel over the Loibl summit, stopping by the Deutscher Peter tavern north of the pass. Thereafter he ordered the expansion of the mountain road as part of the long-distance route from the Austrian capital Vienna to the Port of Trieste. Two obelisks were erected at the top of the pass to commemorate his stay. Loibl Tunnel During World War II, a meter long tunnel was built at above sea level by command of the Nazi Gauleiter of Carinthia, Friedrich Rainer, to bypass the steep upper parts of the mountain road. Work was performed by the Viennese Universale Hoch- und Tiefbau construction company, employing 660 civilian workers, several posted by the Service du travail obligatoire of Vichy France, and 1,652 forced labourers supplied by contract with the SS. These prisoners were interned in two minor subcamps of the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp, one on each side of the pass. They were put under the command of Obersturmf√ºhrer Julius Ludolf, who served in Mauthausen since 1940 and was notorious for his excessive beatings. Loibl subcamp memorial Tunnel construction started on the south side in March 1943. The first forced labourers arrived at Tr≈æiƒç in June and were immediately transported to Loibl Pass by SS personnel. Most of the inmates were POWs and political prisoners. They were interned with German and Austrian criminals who assumed Kapo functions. Under inhumane conditions, about 40 forced labourers died either from starvation and exhaustion, or were killed by mistreatment, work-related accidents and rockfalls. By August, Ludolf was removed from his post after the construction company complained about the number of inmates that became incapable of working due to beatings and torture. To keep the work force efficient, hundreds of injured or sick prisoners were sent back to the main camp, or if unable to be transported were executed on-site by camp physician Sigbert Ramsauer (de) by petrol injection. The breakthrough of the tunnel happened in December 1943. Rainer and several high-ranking SS members came to inspect the project. The first Wehrmacht army vehicles passed through the very tight tunnel on 4 December 1944. Military traffic, German soldiers retreating from the Yugoslav Front and refugees used the tunnel until it was closed in 1947. At the end of the war, on 7 May 1945, the surviving 950 prisoners from the two camps were largely abandoned by the guards and began marching down to Feistritz im Rosental, where they met Yugoslav Partisans on the following day. As the survivors had in effect 'freed themselves', theirs were the only subcamps of Mauthausen-Gusen not to be either evacuated or liberated. An American military court sentenced commandant Julius Ludolf to death on 13 May 1946. British military courts sentenced two other SS commanders of the camps, Jakob Winkler and Walter Briezke, to death on 10 November 1947, and sentenced camp physician Sigbert Ramsauer to life imprisonment on 10 October 1947. Ramsauer was released in 1954, however, and soon obtained an employment at the Klagenfurt state hospital. Today plaques at the Austrian tunnel portal and a memorial on the Slovenian side, erected at the site of the southern Loibl camp, commemorate the injustices. A joint memorial service was held on 13 June 2015.

Although one can also find members in other re-enactment groups, it may very well be the largest household in that organization. It covers all the Kingdoms, though in some Kingdoms members do not always advertise themselves as Hordesmen. The Dark Horde first appeared (or, as they put it, \\"walked out of the trees\\"\\"Timeline of the Dorsai Irregulars\\") at a Crown Tourney of the Middle Kingdom, on May 8, 1971 (A.S.

According to Yang himself in a song he wrote describing the incident, he was hailed as the Khakhan of the Horde because while en route to that event he and his friends stopped at a bike shop that was having a sale on sheepskin biker's vests. The others all bought vests that had dyed fleece, while the only one he found that would fit him was natural. Because his was different from the rest, he had to be the \\"leader of the pack\\".Yang: The Rise and Fall of the Dark Horde, 3rd ed.; Urbana, IL: Folump Enterprises Although the Dark Horde is particularly interested in the historical aspects of pre-1650 Mongol culture, some members have personae of Slavic, Middle Eastern, Viking, Celtic, Cherokee, German, Japanese, and Chinese origins, among others. Thus, one cannot always identify Hordesmen by their garb. They may very well be dressed as a Cavalier, a Crusader, or wearing a royal Crown. This diversity is an homage to the historical Mongol Empire not only covered the greatest land-mass of any single country to date but also that the Mongols were generally tolerant of the cultural and religious differences of those they absorbed. They did not impose their belief systems, customs, or mores on subjugated peoples, nor even much care how they lived or whom they worshiped, as long as they were prompt with required tributary payments and did not try to rebel.Asia for Educators Program at Columbia University. \\"Asian Topics in World History: The Mongols in World History: The Mongols' Mark on Global History: A Tactic of Religious Tolerance\\" Members of the Great Dark Horde are held to ideals of self- discipline, honor, and the pursuit of perfection; equality and respect for each person, regardless of race, sex, age, or allegiance; and camaraderie and friendship. Although the role of the Horde is to serve as an anti- aristocratical alternative within the SCA, Horde members have served as King and/or Queen (and as Prince and/or Princess) in many SCA Kingdoms and Principalities; have served as officers at all levels of the SCA; have served as Baron/Baroness of SCA Baronies; and have earned almost every known award and rank of peerage the SCA has to offer. The emblem of the Great Dark Horde is a red and black yin-yang symbol traversed by a yellow lightning-bolt. Those Horde members who wish to be known as such are identifiable by cords of braided, woven, or twisted red and black yarn which hang from the belt, commonly called \\"Horde Cords\\". Those who choose not to be openly known as such are sometimes jocularly referred to as \\"ninjas\\".

In the Middle Ages, the region was a center of the Serbian Principality and of the Serbian Kingdom, whose capital was the city of Ras (a World Heritage Site) in the late 12th century. Name Ruins of the Ras fortress, the capital of the Grand Principality of Serbia The name is derived from the name of the region's most important fort of Ras, which first appears in the 6th century sources as Arsa, recorded under that name in the work De aedificiis of Byzantine historian Procopius. By the 10th century, the variant Ras became common name for the fort, as attested by the work De Administrando Imperio, written by Constantine Porphyrogenitus, and also by the Byzantine seal of John, governor of Ras (c. 971‚Äì976). In the same time, Ras became the seat of the Eastern Orthodox Eparchy of Ras, centered in the Church of the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul. The name of the eparchy eventually started to denote the entire area under its jurisdiction and later, thus becoming the common regional name. Under Stefan Nemanja (1166-1196), the fortress of Ras was re-generated as the state capital, and as such it became eponymous for the entire state. The first attested use of the term Ra≈°ka ( or Rassia) as a designation for the Serbian state was made in a charter issued in Kotor in 1186, mentioning Stefan Nemanja as the ruler of Rascia. From the end of the 12th century, the term Ra≈°ka (Rascia) became a common exonym for Serbia in western sources (Papacy, Italian, Hungarian, German, French etc.) often in conjunction: Serbia or Ra≈°ka (), and the term Ra≈°ani () became a common designation for Serbs. Between the 15th and 18th centuries, the term Ra≈°ka (, ) was also used to designate some southern regions of the Pannonian Plain, inhabited by migrating Serbs, who settled there during the late Middle Ages and the Ottoman period. During that time, Serbs were still referred to as Rasciani or Raci (), and those terms became common Hungarian designations for the Serbs. History Church of the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul, in the center pf the historical Ra≈°ka region =Middle Ages= The 10th century De Administrando Imperio mentions Rasa (Stari Ras) as a border area between Bulgaria and Serbia at the end of the 9th century. Newer research indicates that the principal settlement of Ras in the late 9th century was part of the First Bulgarian Empire. In 971, the Byzantine Catepanate of Ras was established, but in 976 Bulgarian control was restored. Basil II recaptured itin 1016-18. It remained a Byzantine frontier area until John II Komnenos lost the area as a result of the Byzantine‚ÄìHungarian War (1127‚Äì1129). The fortress of Ras was then burnt by the Serbian army. Its last commander was a Kritoplos who was then punished by the Emperor for the fall of the fortress.

In order to mark the occasion, prince Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá (1815-1839) founded a new town, that was also called Ra≈°ka, situated at the very confluence of Ra≈°ka river and Ibar, right at the border with Ottoman territory. In 1878, some southwestern parts of the historical Ra≈°ka region, around modern Andrijevica, were liberated from the Ottoman rule and incorporated into the Principality of Montenegro. In order to mark the occasion, prince Nikola of Montenegro (1860-1918) decided to name the newly formed Eastern Orthodox diocese as the Eparchy of Zahumlje and Ra≈°ka (). After the Ottoman rule ended in 1912, central parts of the historical Ra≈°ka region became parts of Kingdom of Serbia and the Kingdom of Montenegro. The fortress of Stari Ras became a part of Serbia. Between 1918 and 1922, Ra≈°ka District was one of the administrative units of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. Its seat was in Novi Pazar. In 1922, a new administrative unit known as the Ra≈°ka Oblast was formed with its seat in ƒåaƒçak. In 1929, this administrative unit was abolished and its territory was divided among three newly formed provinces (banovinas). The region is a part of the wider \\"Old Serbia\\" region, used in historical terms. Within the borders of modern Serbia, historical Ra≈°ka region covers (approximately) the territorial span of three districts: Ra≈°ka, Zlatibor and Moravica. Culture Some of the churches in western Serbia and eastern Bosnia were built by masters from Ra≈°ka, who belonged to the Ra≈°ka architectural school.

Ste Cork released Overkill under the Creative Commons NoDerivs license. Plot A pilot who has been handed a very difficult assignment to destroy the menacing alien forces that have captured six planets in a neighboring allied solar system. The aliens have enslaved all of the inhabitants of the planets and must be killed. Gameplay The objective in Overkill is to destroy all enemies on a planet, thus restoring order. The ship has some basic necessities such as fuel, shields, and a weapon but it can be upgraded by picking up various goodies. Being hit by projectiles or running into enemy ships and walls damages the ship. Once the shield meter is depleted, the ship is destroyed and costs a life. Development After the Commodore 64 market was declining, Martin Holland went on to do art for games that ran on systems of the time. Together with Ste Cork (who came up with the concept) they developed \\"OverKill\\". Sales for the game were successful due to the solid EGA graphics.

It is long and, unlike the Danube itself, it borders Vienna's city centre, Innere Stadt, where the Wien River (Wienfluss) flows into it.\\"Donaukanal\\", aeiou Encyclopedia (see below: External links). The Donaukanal bifurcates from the main river at the Nu√üdorf weir and lock complex, in D√∂bling, and joins it again just upstream of the \\"Praterspitz\\", at the Prater park in Simmering. The island thus formed between the Donaukanal and the Danube holds two of the 23 districts of Vienna: Brigittenau (20th District) and Leopoldstadt (2nd District). The canal is crossed by fifteen road bridges and five rail bridges. Because in German, the name Kanal, which has been used since about 1700, evokes associations of an open sewer, attempts at renaming the Donaukanal have been made (one suggestion was Kleine Donau-- Little Danube) but have not met with success.  History  The name \\"Donaukanal\\" (\\"Danube Canal\\"), has been used since 1686, for the southern branch of the River Danube in Vienna. Originally a natural branch, during 1598‚Äì1600, it was regulated for the first time by Baron von Hoyos. In the 19th century, the Schwimmtor, a movable floating barrier, was constructed near the upstream entrance to the canal. It was designed to protect the canal from floods and drift ice, and entered service in 1873. The Nu√üdorf weir and lock complex were constructed between 1894 and 1899, and provide a greater degree of flood control than the Schwimmtor. However the Schwimmtor remained in use until World War I, and was not scrapped until 1945.  Usage  In the early 1990s, work started in the southern section of the Donaukanal (between the 2nd and 3rd districts) to create a recreation area along its banks. The paths on both sides of the Donaukanal are regularly used by joggers, cyclists and skaters. Recently, there have been successful attempts during the summer months at turning the place into a more attractive recreational area (summer stages, flea markets, caf√©s, etc.). Boat rides circling Leopoldstadt and Brigittenau via the Donaukanal and Danube start at Schwedenplatz, close to the city centre. The same location provides the Vienna terminal of the Twin City Liner fast ferry service that links Vienna with Bratislava, transiting the Donaukanal to reach the Danube. The Donaukanaltreiben Festival is held every year in June in several locations along the Donaukanal. Mainly Austrian professional and amateur bands are invited but from year to year the organisers invite bands from the neighbouring countries.  Cultural influences  The banks of the Donaukanal were immortalized by Heinz Conrads in his song \\"A schr√§ge Wiesn\\" (\\"A Sloping Lawn\\"; later covered by Willi Resetarits and Rainhard Fendrich), where the hero, Franz, chooses not to go on holiday. Instead, he spends his spare time napping on the grassy slopes next to the Donaukanal.

For population details as taken at the 2011 census see under Colwich. It lies beside a main arterial highway, the A51 (linking the English Midlands with Liverpool) but traffic through the village is mainly light, owing to this bypass.http://www.sabre- roads.org.uk/roadlists/f99/51.shtml Nearby also is the West Coast Main Line railway, the Trent and Mersey Canal and beside it, the river Trent. Little Haywood is about northwest of London, about north of Birmingham, northwest of Rugeley and east of Stafford. Little Haywood is cited in the Domesday Book of 1086.http://www.staffshistory.org.uk/domesday.htm Although originally a small village, housing expansion during the 1980s has created a commuter village and most of its inhabitants have employment far outside the confines of the Haywood area. Location Little Haywood is situated on the side of a hill in the system of valleys drained by the rivers Trent and Sow. It lies near the northern edge of The Chase and is surrounded in the main by farmland. Geologically, the village lies on Triassic sandstone of the Sherwood Sandstone Group, with overlying glacial deposits from the last glaciation of Great Britain. The village lies within the Stafford borough of Staffordshire and its name is derived from the Old English \\"haeg wadu,\\" meaning an enclosure in woodland. Waterways There are three main waterways running near to Little Haywood: the River Sow, the River Trent and the Trent and Mersey Canal, which was opened in 1777. A wooden footbridge carrying Meadow Lane across the Trent was built in 1830. Previously the river was crossed by a ford, which was still used by cattle and horse-drawn vehicles after the footbridge was constructed. This wooden bridge was replaced by a brick- and stone-built Weetman's Bridge in 1887. Less than northwest of Little Haywood, the northeastern end of the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal joins the Trent and Mersey Canal. The Trent and Mersey Canal mile post at Little Haywood is number 37.tmc- mileposts.co.uk Features and facilities =Saint Mary's Abbey= The most prominent building in Little Haywood is Saint Mary's Abbey, Colwich. This Roman Catholic abbey is home to a community of enclosed Benedictine nuns and although part of the neighbouring Colwich parish, the abbey and its grounds lie alongside the road that runs through Little Haywood. The Abbey Church of Saint Mary used to cover a large amount of Little Haywood and it has been said that there are tunnels leading from the abbey to Lichfield Cathedral, away,http://www.enjoyengland.com/campaign/outdoor/aonbs/oe2_aonbs_cannock.aspx?bbcam=adwds_out&bbkid;=Cannock+Chase&x; and to Shugborough Hall, a little over away in the opposite direction.http://www.shugborough.org.uk/ Within the village, on land owned by Shugborough Hall, there is evidence of small-scale stone quarrying in the area known to locals as \\"the cliffs\\". =Pubs and shops= The village and its outlying neighbours have an active parish community; the parish council organises events such as village fetes and on a day-to-day basis the social life of the village revolves around its public houses: the 'Red Lion' and the 'Lamb and Flag'.http://www.pubsulike.co.uk/newps/Staffordshire/Stafford.asp?Locality=Little+Haywood There is no church in Little Haywood, no village green and no school. There are, however, the two pubs and a general store. The nearby village of Colwich is less than away and has a church and a primary school but no pub or general store, and so amenities are often shared. =Wall= At the side of the road that runs from Little Haywood towards the village of Great Haywood, away, is an example of a \\"make work wall\\", built by employees of Earl Talbot at Haywood Manor (no longer standing) during times when there was little else to do. In order to keep the workers from being idle, Talbot would make work for them in the form of features whose purpose might best be described as decorative. J. R. R. Tolkien The village was home to the newly married Edith Tolkien, wife of author J. R. R. Tolkien, from March 1916 to February 1917.(Great War 2003, pg 134 & 231) Tolkien stayed with his wife in Cottage 1, Gipsy Green, on the Teddesley Park Estate, near the village during the winter of 1916, whilst recuperating from trench fever.(Great War 2003, pg 207) The surrounding landscape was said to be an inspiration for his early literary works about Middle-earth.. At the cottage he began work on what would become The Silmarillion. The village of Norbury lies about away and may relate to the \\"Norbury of the Kings\\" that appears in The Lord of the Rings.

The book was written by Jason L Blair, featuring illustrations by Drew Baker, Dimitrios \\"Jim\\" Denaxas, Veronica V. Jones, hive, Nick Wilson, Kieran Yanner, Bradley K. McDevitt, and Julie Hoverson, and additional material by Seth A. Ben-Ezra, Greg Oliver, F. Scott Blair, and Shelby Mallow. Summary In the game, players take on the personae of children, aged 6 to 12, who are being hunted by the minions of a place called Closetland. Closetland is ruled by the Demagogue and his Seven Kings. Each King is the personification of one of the seven deadly sins. The most well-known of the Kings is the Bogeyman, King of Greed. Other creatures include the Closet Monster, the Monster Under The Bed, werewolves, vampires, and much more. The children are not entirely powerless: They have Belief, a special kind of magic that can turn the impossible into the real. Through Belief, pictures of deceased relatives can call forth their protective spirits while teddy bears can spring to life to defend children. Belief also has disadvantages: Stepping on a crack really can break your mother's back and mirrors really can capture souls. A tenth anniversary edition of the original game was released in summer 2011. Titled Happy Birthday, Little Fears, it collects the original text, revised rules, author commentary, and all the official supplements into a single volume. Awards Little Fears was nominated for an Origins Award as the Roleplaying Game of the Year in 2002. The book was nominated for and won the RPGnet Award for the Most Disturbing/Controversial Game of 2001. Foreign editions and expansions Also in 2002, Little Fears was licensed by prominent German game publisher Feder & Schwert for release in the German language market. The German version, titled Kleine √Ñngste, inspired the industrial duo Janus to release a soundtrack. Packaged with a limited edition of Janus' studio release Auferstehung, the Kleine √Ñngste CD featured seven eerily haunting songs. Janus frontman RIG also released a German-language storybook inspired by Little Fears/Kleine √Ñngste which was limited to 666 copies. In it, RIG tells a story from the Little Fears universe. Little Fears was also licensed by French publisher 7√®me Cercle who released the French language edition of Little Fears (which retained its English title) in 2003. The game was illustrated entirely by the Peru brothers and featured a cover by Samuel Araya. 7√®me Cercle also released a game screen for use in the game featuring an original mural by St√©phane et Olivier Peru. The English edition of Little Fears went out of publication in 2004, after selling through its initial print run. The copyright to the work is held by Jason L Blair. Key 20 Publishing no longer has any Little Fears-related content on its website. In 2006, an article announced the 2007 release of a new edition of Little Fears, called Little Fears: Nightmare Edition. In January 2008, Jason L Blair issued a statement regarding his regret that the game had not been ready for publishing in the promised time frame, and that he \\"decided to step away from it for a bit to reevaluate the game, what I wanted from it and I what it needed to be.\\" Novels In January 2008, Blair said that he had written a young adult novel set in Little Fears called The Wolf Pact and that he was working on its sequel. The completion of the first draft of Wolf Pact was announced in 2016, and the sequel's name was revealed to be Fairy Tale Ending. Little Fears Nightmare Edition Blair released Little Fears Nightmare Edition in print and PDF on October 19th, 2009. This version is a complete overhaul of the system and premise with some figures key to the original, such as the Demagogue and the Kings, being completely removed. Closetland remains as the source of the monsters and is better detailed than before. Tonally, the game is more focused on Goosebumps-style horror. The controversial elements were mostly removed. While the Kings were excised, some of them remained in name as regular monsters. The game uses a dice engine called the Top 3 System which was built especially for the game.

The plot is inspired by the life of Maria von Maltzan originally told in the non-fiction book The Last Jews in Berlin by Leonard Gross about a countess who hides her Jewish boyfriend in her apartment in World War II. It was a co-production between England and West Germany. It was broadcast on television in the USA, but released in cinemas in other countries. Plot German countess Nina von Halder (Bisset) is a student in veterinary medicine in Berlin, Germany on the eve of World War II. Ostracized by her family due to her liberal views and opposition to the Nazi government, she lives alone, independent and strong- willed. The film opens with Nina studying at the library the day Germany invades Poland. She is angered and tells a classmate she knows the reasons Hitler gave for the invasion (to allegedly rescue ethnic Germans from Polish attackers) are a pack of lies. One day while on errands Nina witnesses Brownshirts attacking a vendor. She also sees a man attempting to help the vendor. She confronts them and demands to know why he is being attacked. They say they beat him because he sells to Jews. She tells them to leave the man alone or she will report them to her brother-in-law, a high-ranking Nazi official. Later, while attending an informal party hosted by her friend, she recognizes the man who came to the assistance of the vendor. Her friend, Erica, tells her that his name is Fritz Friedlaender and he is a writer. She is immediately attracted to him, but Erica warns Nina that it would be illegal to date him under the Nuremberg Laws because he is Jewish. The headstrong Nina ignores this advice, however, and begins a relationship with him. When he returns home, he finds Nina desperately waiting for him. He tells her what happened. She has worse news for him; the Resistance has discovered that the Nazis are taking the Jews to Nazi death camps in occupied Poland and gassing them. She still believes his mother is still safe in Theresienstadt. She then tells him about a train going to Switzerland. She and her friends are smuggling several Jews on board. She professes her love for him, but wants him to go where he will be safe. That night, they go to the train depot, where he and other refugees are placed in boxes with a small supply of food and water. As she leaves, she sees Fritz running up to her; he loves her so much that he's unable to leave her. Together they return home. At the war's ending months, Germany is invaded by the Soviet Union in 1945. Nina knows that the Russians want revenge for the millions of their countrymen murdered by the Third Reich. Attempting to hide in the cellar, they are caught by the Russians and forced outside. Nina yells to the soldiers that Fritz is Jewish, but they ignore her. Once outside, Fritz is forced to kneel as the Russians prepare to shoot him. He starts singing \\"Shema Israel\\". The Russian soldier lowers his gun and says that he is Jewish too. During the voice-over while the camera pans over a bombed-out and devastated Berlin, Nina tells the audience that Ruth Friedlaender is eventually transferred from Theresienstadt to Auschwitz, where she is gassed. Eventually she and Fritz marry; Fritz dies in 1973.

Their first performance was at Nudestock 97. Gaia Consort has worked with a large number of musicians from the Pacific NorthWest, including Heather Alexander and Dan Ochipinti of the Celtic folk-rock band Uffington Horse. Gaia Consort released their first album, Gaia Circles in 1999, their second album Secret Voices in 2001, their third Evolve in 2004, and their fourth Vitus Dance in 2007. The group has focused on playing at house concerts, self-produced shows and events such as Faerieworlds and Heartland Pagan Festival, instead of more traditional musical venues. This, in addition to their songs which frequently involve themes such as neopaganism, positive sexuality and polyamory, has made Gaia Consort a favorite of the pagan and sexual subcultures of the Pacific Northwest. They enjoy a strong fan base, evidenced from the fact that all of their albums are financed by donations from the listening community. Seattle filmmaker and polyamory advocate Terisa Greenan has produced several music videos for Gaia Consort. Gaia Consort's philosophy is somewhat unusual in the music industry: the majority of the band's music is available freely on their website, and Gaia Consort actively encourages the non-commercial sharing of these MP3-format songs, saying that 'music should not be bottled up' for the few who can afford to pay for it. A major theme of much of Gaia Consort's work is the greater world and how it affects our lives; religion is one such target, while other songs have a decidedly 'anti-war' tone (one song asks 'What will it come to when we've finally had enough?').

It addresses the acute toxicity of agents such as soil fumigants, fungicides, herbicides, insecticides, miticides, molluscicides, nematicides, or rodenticides.  General considerations  Assignment to a toxicity class is based typically on results of acute toxicity studies such as the determination of values in animal experiments, notably rodents, via oral, inhaled, or external application. The experimental design measures the acute death rate of an agent. The toxicity class generally does not address issues of other potential harm of the agent, such as bioaccumulation, issues of carcinogenicity, teratogenicity, mutagenic effects, or the impact on reproduction. Regulating agencies may require that packaging of the agent be labeled with a signal word, a specific warning label to indicate the level of toxicity. By jurisdiction = World Health Organization = The World Health Organization (WHO) names four toxicity classes: *Class I ‚Äì a: extremely hazardous *Class I ‚Äì b: highly hazardous *Class II: moderately hazardous *Class III: slightly hazardous The system is based on LD50 determination in rats, thus an oral solid agent with an LD50 at 5 mg or less/kg bodyweight is Class Ia, at 5‚Äì50 mg/kg is Class Ib, LD50 at 50‚Äì2000 mg/kg is Class II, and at LD50 at the concentration more than 2000 mg/kg is classified as Class III. Values may differ for liquid oral agents and dermal agents.https://www.who.int/ipcs/publications/pesticides_hazard_2009.pdf?ua=1 = European Union = There are eight toxicity classes in the European Union's classification system, which is regulated by Directive 67/548/EEC: *Class I: very toxic *Class II: toxic *Class III: harmful *Class IV : corrosive *Class V : irritant *Class VI : sensitizing *Class VII : carcinogenic *Class VIII : mutagenic Very toxic and toxic substances are marked by the European toxicity symbol. = India = The Indian standardized system of toxicity labels for pesticides uses a 4-color system (red, yellow, blue, green) to plainly label containers with the toxicity class of the contents. =United States= The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) uses four toxicity classes in its toxicity category rating. Classes I to III are required to carry a signal word on the label. Pesticides are regulated in the United States primarily by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). Toxicity Class I *most toxic; *requires signal word: \\"Danger-Poison\\", with skull and crossbones symbol, possibly followed by: :\\"Fatal if swallowed\\", \\"Poisonous if inhaled\\", \\"Extremely hazardous by skin contact--rapidly absorbed through skin\\", or \\"Corrosive--causes eye damage and severe skin burns\\" Class I materials are estimated to be fatal to an adult human at a dose of less than 5 grams (less than a teaspoon). Toxicity Class II *moderately toxic *Signal word: \\"Warning\\", possibly followed by: :\\"Harmful or fatal if swallowed\\", \\"Harmful or fatal if absorbed through the skin\\", \\"Harmful or fatal if inhaled\\", or \\"Causes skin and eye irritation\\" Class II materials are estimated to be fatal to an adult human at a dose of 5 to 30 grams. Toxicity Class III *slightly toxic *Signal word: Caution, possibly followed by: :\\"Harmful if swallowed\\", \\"May be harmful if absorbed through the skin\\", \\"May be harmful if inhaled\\", or \\"May irritate eyes, nose, throat, and skin\\" Class III materials are estimated to be fatal to an adult human at some dose in excess of 30 grams. Toxicity Class IV *practically nontoxic *no Signal Word required since 2002 General versus restricted use Furthermore, the EPA classifies pesticides into those anybody can apply (General Use Pesticides), and those that must be applied by or under the supervision of a certified individual. Application of Restricted use pesticides requires that a record of the application be kept.

Its name corresponds to the three main qualities that are to be developed through the training in the Subud path. The name \\"Subud\\" is a contraction of these three Javanese words of Sanskrit derivation. Life forces The book refers to the series of experiences that practitioners of the Subud 'latihan' (exercise) may go through in the process of training their inner feeling in practical life. It describes how one can feel the various influences of the forces that accompany human beings in this world, i.e. material, vegetable, animal and \\"ordinary human\\" forces. The book discusses how, through awareness of their influences upon the inner feeling, it is possible to integrate and be in harmony with these forces, which were provided to humanity for living in this world, and to be no longer dominated by them, through the support of the Great Life Force. The book explains many examples of how the Subud latihan (the spiritual exercise of Subud) may play a role in daily life. Situations are described whereby a person may feel and 'receive' what occurs in the inner feeling when approaching this or that circumstance. This supposedly represents 'training' in how to understand the various indications so that human beings may be able to deal with the pressure of the life forces and consequently develop their truly human qualities and faculties. Subuh's writing illustrates how humans come to be in thrall to material things which they own or desire. It offers an explanation as to why inner conflicts arise and how people can so easily be swept up by impulses, moods and emotions inconsistent with humane action. In the book the various \\"life forces\\" which struggle for dominance within a person's consciousness are referred to as \\"Nafsu\\". The book is not intended to be a teaching but to indicate what one might experience as a result of the continued practice of the latihan. Name \\"Susila\\" is said to represent a quality of human beings which enables their behaviour to be 'noble' because they are conscious of what is right and what is wrong. \\"Budhi\\" is said to be part of God's authority which was placed inside every creature. When this Budhi is directed voluntarily by people in the direction of God's will, then their lives will supposedly be blessed. \\"Dharma\\" is said to be the projection in practical human life of God's blessing. Accordingly, various forms of human activity, including business, arts, education, health and so on, may become outer expressions of the grace that humanity has received within, thereby engendering welfare and happiness. Pak Subuh called this \\"True Human Culture\\". The word dharma is central to both Hindu and Buddhist thought, and the term Budhi shares a root with the word Buddha. Although the author described himself as a conventional Muslim, the book's name chimes with ancient Indian wisdom. This is consistent with the Wayang stories whose characters (such as The Pandava brothers) and parables Subuh occasionally refers to in his earlier talks. (These popular stories drawn from the MahƒÅbhƒÅrata have, for centuries, underpinned and enriched Javanese spirituality.) Writing style The book was written in High-Javanese language and Kawi, and it was reputedly received in the form of a poem, accompanied by traditional Javanese melodies. It was recommended by Pak Subuh as being for only Subud members to read, since people who have not experienced the latihan of Subud might try to understand the book in an analytical way, yet be unable to relate it to their own direct experiences. There is some discussion about this as the Subud association does not aim to be secretive, but also wants to avoid making unverifiable claims. The book was (and is) intended as an optional supplementary guide for people already undertaking their own spiritual journey. Notes References * Sumohadiwidjojo, M. S.

Two Raxwerke plants employed several thousand forced laborers from the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp (on 20 June 1943 Mauthausen delivered ~500 prisoners to the Rax-Werke). Operations Part of the Eastern Works (V-2 facilities in the Vienna-Freidrichshafen area), the 30 meter-high Serbs hall at the Raxwerke was selected for V-2 manufacturing. A few V-2 center sections had been assembled by the Raxwerke when, on 2 November 1943, the US Fifteenth Air Force targeted the nearby Wiener Neust√§dter Flugzeugwerke (WNF) plant in Operation Crossbow and hit the Raxwerke. Rax test equipment was subsequently moved to the site of the Redl-Zipf brewery in central Austria (code name Schlier) where V-2 test stands were built.

It is 2‚Äì3 km north of Ballyclare, on the road to Larne. It lies on the southern hill slopes overlooking Six Mile Water. In the 2001 Census it had a population of 90 people. It is within the Antrim & Newtownabbey Borough Council area. The village has a very distinctive character and is focused on the junction of three main routes that meet near a medieval parish church. Its buildings cluster between the churches, which are distinctive landmarks, with the strikingly modern facade of First Ballyeaston Presbyterian Church and the unusual bronze cupola of Second Ballyeaston Presbyterian Church. The Boy's Brigade Company belongs to 2nd Ballyeaston while the Girl's Brigade belongs to 1st Ballyeaston and boys and girls from both churches attend each. At the time of the great revival of 1859, the minister of 2nd Ballyeaston was Rev A. Pollock. Reference books state that the revival hit the parish with such power, he died as a result of his strenuous labours. He is buried in the small graveyard behind the church and the inscription on his headstone says that he died in the field with his armour on. The middle of the village is a tightly knit group of buildings on both sides of the Trenchill Road, a steep and winding road, which forms the village's main street. Most of its buildings are mostly unchanged and the village still retains much of its original character. At the top of the main street is the old Ballyeaston Flute Band Hall. The band won many competitions before their nearby rivals Ballyclare Victoria Flute Band became famous. In 2005, Ballyeaston took the Best Kept Village title in the prestigious SuperValu Best Kept Town and Village Awards. The village last won a Best Kept Award in 2000 and has won six titles since 1982, but this was the first time the village had been given the overall award.

Mock drafts for the NFL Draft or other league drafts are very popular in magazines and online. ESPN has run mock drafts on the front page of its website, allowing any visitor to vote towards a specific team's choice. Mock drafts are often found to be helpful to fans because they allow them to speculate on which members of the collegiate ranks will join the fan's favorite team. There are many Internet and television analysts that are considered experts in this field and can give the fans some understanding of where players are expected to go in drafts. Although mock drafts are created for nearly every sport that uses drafts, they are most commonplace for the National Football League. Mel Kiper Jr. and Todd McShay of ESPN and Mike Mayock of the NFL Network are considered television experts on the NFL Draft. Mock drafts, however, do not replicate the real methodology that teams' general managers use to choose players. Internet mock drafts typically rank many dozens of players per position, often with immense detail for each prospect, and some forecast drafts for several years into the future. NFL teams, by contrast, each year often view even likely first round picks as little more than faceless statistics during the Combine in February, do not evaluate so many players (only about one dozen quarterbacks are selected in each draft, for example), and do not complete their detailed evaluations until just before the draft in late April. Draft analysts often claim that a player has \\"climbed\\" or \\"fallen\\" into another draft round due to various factors, but such statements presuppose‚Äîoften inaccurately‚Äîthat teams have already made detailed evaluations of the player and that a consensus exists across the entire league. Fantasy sports mock drafts Mock drafts are practice fantasy sports drafts. Before a league's draft takes place, mock drafts are a way to practice before someone's pride and/or money are on the line. Participating in a mock draft alerts fantasy players to real players that are going higher or lower than one expected. Savvy fantasy sports players also monitor the results of these drafts for trends and to see where players are being taken to get a feel for each player's value (as shown in the Average Draft Position (or ADP) from multiple mock drafts). Herbie Teope of The Kansas City Star wrote in 2010, \\"Die-hard participants are set to engage in this activity throughout the summer as part of an evaluation process to gauge player values before drafting for real.\\" References Category:Drafts (sports) Category:Fantasy sports ","title":"Mock draft"},{"id":"4815678","text":"Roland John Groome (10 July 1897 in Kettering, Northamptonshire, United Kingdom - 20 September 1935) was a Canadian aviator from Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada.

Although the company was a failure Groome had registered Canada's first aircraft, C-GAAA, a Curtis JN4 biplane and in April 1920 he became the first licensed commercial pilot in Canada. Because the forerunner of Transport Canada made their first trip from Ottawa, Ontario in 1920 to Regina, Groome was able to claim several aviation firsts in Canada. He was to receive the first pilots licence, the first commercial pilots and the airfield he had helped set up was licensed as Canada's first \\"air harbour\\". At the same time his mechanic Robert McCombie was given Canada's first air engineer's license. In 1927 Groome set up his second company \\"Universal Air Industries\\" at a new airfield called \\"Lakeview Aerodrome\\".

Sullivan died on April 24, 2001, of leukemia at a Scottsdale, Arizona, hospital. He was 78. Early life Born to Charles and Helen Sullivan in Charleston, West Virginia. He was raised in a small house in a dirt alley called Washington Court in one of Charleston's poorest sections. His parents divorced when he was three years old and he grew up an only child. Sullivan has often re-told the event which set a course for the remainder of his life. At the age of twelve, he tried to purchase a Coca- Cola in a drugstore on Capitol Street. The proprietor refused to sell him the drink, saying: \\"Stand on your feet, boy. You can't sit here.\\" This incident inspired Sullivan's lifetime pursuit of fighting racial prejudice. Sullivan also attributed much of his early influence to his grandmother: As a teen- ager, Sullivan‚Äîwho as an adult stood 6 ft 5 in tall ‚Äîattended Charleston's Garnet High School for blacks and received a basketball and football scholarship to West Virginia State College in 1939 where he was a member of Tau chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity. A foot injury ended his athletic career and forced Sullivan to pay for college by working in a steel mill. Baptist Minister Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York Sullivan became a Baptist minister in West Virginia at the age of 18. In 1943, during a visit to West Virginia, noted black minister Adam Clayton Powell convinced Sullivan to move to New York City where he attended the Union Theological Seminary (1943‚Äì45) and later Columbia University (Master's in Religion 1947). He also served as Powell's assistant minister at the Abyssinian Baptist Church. During this period, Sullivan met his wife Grace, a woman whom he referred to as \\"Amazing Grace.\\" The couple would eventually have three children, Hope, Julie and Howard. One of Sullivan's greater achievements during his time in New York was the recruitment of \\"a hundred colored men for the police force\\" in Harlem with Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia's support and encouragement. In 1945 Leon and Grace Sullivan moved to South Orange, New Jersey, where Sullivan became pastor at First Baptist Church. Five years later, the two moved to Philadelphia, where Leon took on the role of pastor of Zion Baptist Church. Known there as \\"the Lion of Zion\\", he served from 1950 to 1988, eventually increasing the church's membership from 600 to 6,000, making it one of the largest congregations in America. Selective Patronage Movement Sullivan took his first active role in the civil rights movement by helping to organize a march on Washington, D.C., in the early 1940s. Sullivan believed jobs were the key to improving African-American lives and starting in 1958 he asked that Philadelphia's largest companies interview young blacks. Only two companies responded positively so Sullivan, through his affiliation with other ministers, organized a boycott of various businesses which he referred to as \\"Selective Patronage\\". The slogan was \\"Don't buy where you don't work\\" and the boycott was extremely effective since blacks constituted about 20% of Philadelphia's population. Sullivan estimated the boycott produced thousands of jobs for African Americans in a period of four years. The New York Times featured the program with a front-page story, and later, Fortune magazine brought the program to greater public attention on a national scale. By 1962, the effectiveness of Sullivan's boycotts came to the attention of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the SCLC who persuaded Sullivan to share information with them on his success. The exchange led to SCLC's economic arm, Operation Breadbasket, in 1967, headed by Jesse Jackson. Self-Help Movement Sullivan's work was built on the principle of \\"self-help\\", which provides people with the tools to help themselves overcome barriers of poverty and oppression. African Americans had been excluded from the types of training which led to better paying jobs. Sullivan realized that simply making jobs available was not enough. He said, In 1964, Sullivan founded Opportunities Industrialization Centers (OIC) of America in an abandoned jail house in North Philadelphia. The program took individuals with little hope and few prospects and offered them job training and instruction in life skills and then helped place them into jobs. The movement quickly spread around the nation. With sixty affiliated programs in thirty states and the District of Columbia, OIC has grown into a movement, which has served over two million disadvantaged and under-skilled people. This approach also led to the formation of the Opportunities Industrialization Centers International (OICI) in 1969. Around the same time, Sullivan established the Zion Investment Association (ZIA), a company which invested in and started new businesses. Sullivan also helped to establish more than 20 programs under the International Foundation for Education and Self-Help (IFESH) (now headed by his daughter Dr. Julie Helen Sullivan), including the Global Sullivan Principles initiative. Other IFESH programs include the African-African American Summit (now renamed the Leon H. Sullivan Summit), the Peoples Investment Fund for Africa, the Self-Help Investment Program, Teachers for Africa and Schools for Africa. IFESH has placed teachers in Africa, trained African bankers, built schools, developed small businesses, disseminated books and school supplies, created literacy programs, distributed medicines to prevent river-blindness and helped to combat the spread of HIV/AIDS. 10-36 Plan Inspired by a well-known parable from the Bible, Sullivan decided to use the church as a vehicle for organizing the black community to consolidate its resources and build a community-owned economic base. In 1962, during one of his Sunday sermons, he introduced his congregation to his vision of self-help through community investment. \\"One day I preached a sermon at Zion about Jesus feeding the five thousand with a few loaves and a few fish\\", he recalls. \\"Everybody put in their little bit and you had enough to feed everybody, and a whole lot left over. So I said, that is what I am going to do with the church and the community. I said, I am going to ask 50 people to put $10 down for 36 months of loaves and fishes and see if we could accumulate resources enough to build something that we would own ourselves.\\" Although Rev. Sullivan had expected about 50 families to sign up for the 10-36 Plan, the response was overwhelming. Over 200 joined the plan that Sunday morning. His idea of bringing people together to invest in a community-owned enterprise had caught fire. The concept of the 10-36 Plan was to create two separate legal entities. For the first 16 months of the subscription period, investors would contribute to the Zion Non-Profit Charitable Trust (ZNPCT), a Community Development Corporation (CDC) that would support education, scholarships for youth, health services and other programs aimed at social uplift. For the remaining 20 months of the subscription period, investors would make payments to a for-profit corporation, Progress Investment Associates (PIA), which would undertake income-generating projects. At the end of 36 months, subscribers would receive one share of common voting stock and would be entitled to participate in yearly shareholders meetings. As William Downes, the treasurer of the 10-36 Plan and the executive director of ZNPCT explains, the idea of the voting system was to encourage community involvement in the plan. According to Sullivan's philosophy, it was important for people to begin by contributing to the nonprofit side of the effort in order to develop a psychology of giving before receiving. It was also important for people to learn basic economic concepts and to see the 10-36 Plan as a long-term investment. Although stockholders were told that they would eventually receive a dividend, they were cautioned not to expect to obtain profits right away. Their most immediate monetary benefit would be a tax deduction for their contributions to the nonprofit. To participate in the 10-36 Plan, investors had to have faith in the idea of investing in a secure future for the next generation. Rev. Sullivan's vision was to use the tools of the free enterprise system to foster something that is vital to community progress - a sense of ownership and a stake in the common good. Funds accumulated rapidly under the 10-36 Plan, and were soon used to invest in numerous housing and economic development initiatives. In 1964, PIA made its first investment in an 8-unit apartment building in an all-white community. The rationale for buying this property was that it would help address a long- standing problem facing blacks - racial discrimination in housing. The leaders of the Progress Movement believed that money often has the power to speak louder than words in the struggle to improve race relations. One year after its first investment in housing, PIA built Zion Gardens, a middle-income garden apartment complex in North Philadelphia. The $1 million project was financed by using 10-36 funds to leverage a loan from the Federal Housing Administration and a grant from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). While pursuing these development projects, Zion continued to build an equity base through the 10-36 Plan. In 1965, the plan was opened to new subscribers from Zion's congregation, and another 450 joined. Over the years, the Progress Movement has had great success with its strategy of using equity accumulated under the 10-36 Plan to leverage funds from public and private sources, including commercial banks and insurance companies. Progress Plaza After establishing the OIC in the mid-1960s, Zion's next major undertaking was the fulfillment of Rev. Sullivan's dream of building the nation's first black-owned and developed shopping center, to be named Progress Plaza. In addition to addressing his concern about the lack of black ownership of major businesses in America, the project would deal with the problem of unemployment in North Philadelphia by generating a substantial number of jobs. After convincing the city's Redevelopment Authority to donate land for the project, Rev. Sullivan set out to raise the capital needed to build the shopping center. \\"So I went to the chairman of the bank and I said, I want a construction loan\\", he recounts. \\"He said, well Reverend, you need some equity for something like this. Think about it and come back later in two, three or four years, and let's see what we can do.\\" Rev. Sullivan was already prepared for that challenge, however. \\"Give me the sack\\", he told Zion's treasurer, William Downes. \\"I opened it up and $400,000 worth of equities came out\\", he describes. \\"The man's eye glasses fell off his eyes. He came around the table and took my hand and said, Reverend, we can work together.\\" Rev. Sullivan's theory about the power of money to deal with persistent racial inequalities was proving to be correct. As he concludes:'' Progress Plaza, which is located on Broad Street, one of Philadelphia's main thoroughfares, was dedicated in 1968 before a crowd of 10,000 well-wishers. In some sense, the shopping center was the culmination of the Progress Movement's multiple goals. Because it was a major construction project, it created a large number of construction jobs for participants in the OIC program. Through an agreement negotiated with Progress Plaza's chain store tenants, the shopping center also made numerous management job opportunities available to African Americans. To fulfill another one of the Progress Movement's primary goals - to encourage the development of black-owned businesses - ZNPCT created an Entrepreneurial Training Center at Progress Plaza. With major funding from the Ford Foundation, the center was able to offer managerial and entrepreneurial skills training to hundreds of area residents. Today, over half of the 16 stores in Progress Plaza are black-owned businesses. Another one of the Progress Movement's major goals was to address the social needs of North Philadelphia's community residents. To this end, ZNPCT built a comprehensive Human Services Center that centralizes essential services so that they are easily accessible to area residents. Zion's role was to develop the property and lease it at below-market rent to nonprofit and governmental entities whose programs fulfill ZNPCT's charitable mission. Located adjacent to Progress Plaza, the Center currently houses a Social Security Administration office, an unemployment compensation office, a police training academy, and a health service center run by Temple University. In the 1980s, Progress Plaza was taken over by Wendell Whitlock of Progress Investment Associates, who is now the chairman emeritus. In 2018, Progress Plaza celebrated its 50-year anniversary with commemorations from local politician Congressman Dwight Evans who was influenced by Leon Sullivan's thinking in his book \\"Build, Brother, Build.\\" Sullivan Principles as a response to apartheid In 1971, Sullivan joined the General Motors Board of Directors and became the first African-American on the board of a major corporation. He went on to serve on General Motors' board for over 20 years. In 1977, Sullivan developed a code of conduct for companies operating in South Africa called the Sullivan Principles, as an alternative to complete disinvestment. As part of the Board of Directors at General Motors Sullivan lobbied GM and other large corporations to voluntarily withdrawal from doing business in South Africa while the system of apartheid was still in effect. In 1988, Sullivan retired from Zion Baptist Church. Sullivan was determined to provide a model of self- help and empowerment to the people of Africa. He began using his talent for bringing world leaders together to find solutions to international issues through the establishment of the International Foundation for Education and Self-Help (IFESH) in order to establish and maintain programs and activities in the areas of agriculture, business and economic development, democracy and governance, education and health. These programs would in turn help governments in sub-Saharan Africa reduce poverty and unemployment and build civil societies. To further expand human rights and economic development to all communities, Sullivan created the Global Sullivan Principles of Social Responsibility in 1997. In 1999, the Global Sullivan Principles were issued at the United Nations. This expanded code calls for multinational companies to take an active role in the advancement of human rights and social justice. Then United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan had this to say about Sullivan's contributions: Leon H. Sullivan Summit Sullivan organized the first Summit in Abidjan, C√¥te d'Ivoire in 1991 as a result of a number of requests and conversations he had with African leaders seeking an honest dialog among and between leaders of African countries and government officials and leaders from developed countries. Since then, the biennial Leon H. Sullivan Summit has brought together the world's political and business leaders, delegates representing national and international civil and multinational organizations, and members of academic institutions in order to focus attention and resources on Africa's economic and social development. Their mission was inspired by Rev. Leon H. Sullivan's belief that the development of Africa is a matter of global partnerships. It was particularly important to Rev. Sullivan that Africa's Diaspora and Friends of Africa are active participants in Africa's development. The Leon H Sullivan Summit is now organized by the Leon H Sullivan Foundation, an organization dedicated to expanding Leon Sullivan's vision of empowering the underprivileged, which is headed by Leon Sullivan's daughter Hope Masters.

Total Wine & More was named Retailer of the Year by Market Watch in 2006, Beverage Dynamics in 2008, and Wine Enthusiast Magazine in 2004 and 2014. The company is headquartered in North Bethesda, Maryland. History A Total Wine & More outlet in Springfield, Virginia In 1985, Trone and family members opened stores in the Pittsburgh area known as Beer and Pop Warehouse and later Beer World, though legal experiences in Pennsylvania led them to leave the state. In 1991 brothers David and Robert Trone founded Liquor World as a small, independent store in Claymont, Delaware, which was followed with a second store in Milltown, Delaware. Liquor World grew steadily through the 1990s, expanding down the east coast. The Trones acquired D.C.-area chain Total Beverage in 1998, adopting and modifying that company's moniker for their business. Total Wine entered Florida in 2005, and then California and Arizona in 2007. In August 2016, the company agreed to stop selling alcohol in Connecticut below the state minimum prices, and paid a $37,500 fine. The same year, Total Wine was served with several-day license suspensions by the Massachusetts Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission for selling liquor below its costs ‚Äì a loss leader pricing strategy not allowed in some states. Total Wine sued the state's regulators to overturn the suspensions, and won based on the final cost of the liquor being less than that shown on the initial invoices. The company has only one store in the state of New York. In 2017, the New York State Liquor Authority rejected the company's application for a 21,000-square-foot store near White Plains, New York, and in September 2019, a New York Supreme Court justice blocked the company's plan for a megastore in Hartsdale, in Westchester County, deeming it \\"inappropriate for the region\\"; the company is appealing that decision. Also in 2019, 31-year-old Michelle Trone, who is David Trone's daughter, applied to open a 30,000 square foot store in Queens, New York, saying it would be an independent store, though using the trade name \\"Total Wine & More\\". In mid-March 2020, the company announced a $2-per-hour pay raise for its store employees amid the coronavirus pandemic in \\"recognition of the hard work [they] were doing\\"; in April, the company ended the pay increase because of \\"trends in the business and external environment\\". As of June 2020, Total Wine had 208 stores in 24 states. It conducts online sales in 14 states that allow online alcohol sales. Business operations An outlet in Orlando, Florida Owned and operated by Retail Services and Systems, Total Wine & More offers a large selection of products and advertises them as competitive in price. Each Total Wine store carries approximately 8,000 different wines from around the world, 3,000 types of spirits (where permitted by law), and 2,500 beers. Stores also carries accessories, gifts, and cigars. As of 2018, the company had about 7,000 employees, including 500 employees at their corporate headquarters in Bethesda, Maryland, and 800 wine specialists. Total Wine provides its customers with publications including its separate guides to wine, beer, and spirts, and offers location-specific loyalty programs. The company's 2014 revenue was estimated to be more than $1.5 billion. Co-owner David Trone said that year that the company planned to be at $2 billion in revenues in 2015, and to be at over $3 billion in 2019. In June 2020, Total Wine launched its 210th US outlet. Corporate philanthropy Over the past two decades, according to the company, Total Wine & More has supported local, regional, and national charities with more than $100 million in in-kind and monetary donations. The company said that in 2018 that it had donated over $9,000,000 to 13,000+ organizations in 23 states. Total Wine received the 2014 Market Watch Award for Community Service from Market Watch, a US alcohol beverage industry publication. Wine Spectator editor Marvin Shanken said, \\"The level of time, energy and financial resources that David and Robert Trone have devoted to community service is truly remarkable.\\" Customer education Total Wine & More offers a variety of opportunities for their customers to learn more about the wines, beer and spirits that are sold in their stores. Each store hosts weekly tastings, special events and classes where customers can learn from experts, winemakers, brew masters and industry professionals (as allowed by different state laws). Total Wine pioneered the live virtual tasting, where well-known winemakers host a tasting from their vinyard, which is streamed live in Total Wine's classrooms. Education Centers are also made available for use in every local community. Total Wine & More offers free meeting space for local businesses, clubs, and organizations. Located in over 60 Total Wine stores, each Center is a private room equipped for meeting hosting, and the stores also provide a complimentary 30-minute wine tasting for all attendees (as allowed by different state laws).

Hydrolyzed jojoba esters are commonly used in cosmetic formulations.  Chemical structure  Hydrolyzed jojoba esters are a mixture of the free fatty acids, free fatty alcohols and wax esters resulting from the saponification reaction (cleaving the ester bond) of jojoba oil. These free fatty acids and free fatty alcohols are unbranched aliphatic monounsaturates with a chain length of C16 to C26.  Physical properties  Hydrolyzed jojoba esters are a highly viscous, tacky gel at room temperature. They are a pale straw color and have no clearly defined melting point. They are soluble in most alcohols, glycols and water in certain pH ranges. The pH is typically above 10. When applied to skin, they form a water- resistant barrier which gives desirable substantivity to some cosmetic formulations.  Uses  The topical substantivity and water-resistance of hydrolyzed jojoba esters make them well suited to hold other substances on the surface of the skin or hair. Examples are: sunscreens and UV filters, pigments (for decorative cosmetics), insect repellents, quaternium hair conditioning agents, fragrance, and botanical extracts. Hydrolyzed jojoba esters can extend the moisturizing properties of traditional emulsions, and work as a refatting agent in astringents and toners. The high pH of Hydrolyzed jojoba esters make them suitable as a gel neutralizer to thicken carbomer gels. The most common applications are sunscreens, fragranced lotions, and hair conditioning agents. Hydrolyzed Jojoba Esters created via a saponification reaction contain more than 12 natural long chain fatty alcohols (C16-C26), including natural docosanol (C22:0) known to be an effective anti-viral agent. Hydrolyzed Jojoba Esters containing these natural Jojoba Alcohols has been shown to be 50 times stronger in in-vitro testing than synthetic docosanol (C22:0) in combating the Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV-1).

Inset images are close-up photos of the ball assembly of the top screw. Left inset: recirculating tube removed showing retainer bracket, loose balls and tube. Right inset: closer view of the nut cavity. A ball screw is a mechanical linear actuator that translates rotational motion to linear motion with little friction. A threaded shaft provides a helical raceway for ball bearings which act as a precision screw. As well as being able to apply or withstand high thrust loads, they can do so with minimum internal friction. They are made to close tolerances and are therefore suitable for use in situations in which high precision is necessary. The ball assembly acts as the nut while the threaded shaft is the screw. In contrast to conventional leadscrews, ballscrews tend to be rather bulky, due to the need to have a mechanism to re-circulate the balls. Another form of linear actuator based on a rotating rod is the threadless ballscrew, a.k.a. \\"rolling ring drive\\". In this design, three (or more) rolling-ring bearings are arranged symmetrically in a housing surrounding a smooth (thread-less) actuator rod or shaft. The bearings are set at an angle to the rod, and this angle determines the direction and rate of linear motion per revolution of the rod. An advantage of this design over the conventional ballscrew or leadscrew is the practical elimination of backlash and loading caused by preload nuts. Applications Ball screws are used in aircraft and missiles to move control surfaces, especially for electric fly by wire, and in automobile power steering to translate rotary motion from an electric motor to axial motion of the steering rack. They are also used in machine tools, robots and precision assembly equipment. High precision ball screws are used in steppers for semiconductor manufacturing. History The ball screw was invented independently by H.M. Stevenson and D. Glenn who were issued in 1898 patents 601,451 and 610,044 respectively. Early precise screwshafts were produced by starting with a low precision screwshaft, and then lapping the shaft with several spring-loaded nut laps. By rearranging and inverting the nut laps, the lengthwise errors of the nuts and shaft were averaged. Then, the very repeatable shaft's pitch is measured against a distance standard. A similar process is sometimes used today to produce reference standard screw shafts, or master manufacturing screw shafts. A ball screw is used to expand the Deployable Tower Assembly (DTA) structure on the James Webb Space Telescope Description and operation To maintain their inherent accuracy and ensure long life, great care is needed to avoid contamination with dirt and abrasive particles. This may be achieved by using rubber or leather bellows to completely or partially enclose the working surfaces. Another solution is to use a positive pressure of filtered air when they are used in a semi-sealed or open enclosure. While reducing friction, ball screws can operate with some preload, effectively eliminating backlash (slop) between input (rotation) and output (Linear motion). This feature is essential when they are used in computer-controlled motion-control systems, e.g., CNC machine tools and high precision motion applications (e.g., wire bonding). Disadvantages Depending upon their lead angle, ball screws can be back-driven due to their low internal friction (i.e., the screw shaft can be driven linearly to rotate the ball nut). They are usually undesirable for hand-fed machine tools, as the stiffness of a servo motor is required to keep the cutter from grabbing the work and self-feeding, that is, where the cutter and workpiece exceed the optimum feedrate and effectively jam or crash together, ruining the cutter and workpiece. Cost is also a major factor as Acme screws are cheaper to manufacture. Advantages Low friction in ball screws yields high mechanical efficiency compared to alternatives. A typical ball screw may be 90 percent efficient, versus 20 to 25 percent efficiency of an Acme lead screw of equal size. Lack of sliding friction between the nut and screw lends itself to extended lifespan of the screw assembly (especially in no-backlash systems), reducing downtime for maintenance and parts replacement, while also decreasing demand for lubrication. This, combined with their overall performance benefits and reduced power requirements, may offset the initial costs of using ball screws. Ball screws may also reduce or eliminate backlash common in lead screw and nut combinations. The balls may be preloaded so that there is no \\"wiggle\\" between the ball screw and ball nut. This is particularly desirable in applications where the load on the screw varies quickly, such as machining tools. Manufacture Ball screw shafts may be fabricated by rolling, yielding a less precise, but inexpensive and mechanically efficient product. Rolled ball screws have a positional precision of several thousandths of an inch per foot. =Accuracy= High-precision screw shafts are typically precise to one thousandth of an inch per foot (830 nanometers per centimeter) or better. They have historically been machined to gross shape, case hardened and then ground. The three step process is needed because high temperature machining distorts the work-piece.Schrillo Company's web site. Hard whirling is a recent (2008) precision machining technique that minimizes heating of the work, and can produce precision screws from case-hardened bar stock.Leistritz Company's sales literature. Instrument quality screw shafts are typically precise to 250 nanometers per centimeter. They are produced on precision milling machines with optical distance measuring equipment and special tooling. Similar machines are used to produce optical lenses and mirrors. Instrument screw shafts are generally made of Invar, to prevent temperature from changing tolerances too much. Ball screw are classified using \\"accuracy grades\\" from C0 (most precise) to C10. Ball return systems The circulating balls travel inside the thread form of the screw and nut, and balls are recirculated through various types of return mechanisms. If the ball nut did not have a return mechanism the balls would fall out of the end of the ball nut when they reached the end of the nut. For this reason several different recirculation methods have been developed. An external ballnut employs a stamped tube which picks up balls from the raceway by use of a small pick up finger. Balls travel inside of the tube and are then replaced back in the thread raceway. An internal button ballnut employs a machined or cast button style return which allows balls to exit the raceway track and move one thread then reenter the raceway. An endcap return ballnut employs a cap on the end of the ball nut. The cap is machined to pick up balls out of the end of the nut and direct them down holes which are bored transversely down the ballnut. The complement cap on the other side of the nut directs balls back into the raceway. The returning balls are not under significant mechanical load and the return path may incorporate injection moulded low-friction plastic parts. Thread profile To obtain proper rolling action of the balls, as in a standard ball bearing, it is necessary that, when loaded in one direction, the ball makes contact at one point with the nut, and one point with the screw. In practice, most ball screws are designed to be lightly preloaded, so that there is at least a slight load on the ball at four points, two in contact with the nut and two in contact with the screw. This is accomplished by using a thread profile that has a slightly larger radius than the ball, the difference in radii being kept small (e.g. a simple V thread with flat faces is unsuitable) so that elastic deformation around the point of contact allows a small, but non-zero contact area to be obtained, like any other rolling element bearing. To this end, the threads are usually machined as a \\"gothic arch\\" profile. If a simple semicircular thread profile were used, contact would only be at two points, on the outer and inner edges, which would not resist axial loading. Preloading To remove backlash and obtain the optimum stiffness and wear characteristics for a given application, a controlled amount of preload is usually applied. This is accomplished in some cases by machining the components such that the balls are a \\"tight\\" fit when assembled, however this gives poor control of the preload, and can not be adjusted to allow for wear. It is more common to design the ball nut as effectively two separate nuts which are tightly coupled mechanically, with adjustment by either rotating one nut with respect to the other, so creating a relative axial displacement, or by retaining both nuts tightly together axially and rotating one with respect to the other, so that its set of balls is displaced axially to create the preload. Equations T=\\\\frac{Fl}{2\\\\pi u} with the rotary input driving in the conventional way, or F=\\\\frac{2\\\\pi u T}{l} if the linear force is backdriving the system Where \\\\mathit{T} is torque applied to screw or nut, \\\\mathit{F} is linear force applied, \\\\mathit{l} is ball screw lead, and u is ball screw efficiency. Ball screw standards National and international standards are used to standardize the definitions, environmental requirements, and test methods used for ball screws. Selection of the standard to be used is an agreement between the supplier and the user and has some significance in the design of the screw.

Early life  Kim was born in Kaesong on 27 January 1962 but her family settled in the country's capital, Pyongyang.The Tears of My Soul, Kim Hyon Hui, William Morrow and Co., 1993, pages 13-14 Her father was a career diplomat and as a result, the family lived in Cuba for some time.115 Died in Nov. 29 Crash : N. Korea Agent Confesses, Says She Put Bomb on Jet, Associated Press, Los Angeles Times, January 15, 1988 Kim excelled as a student and in after-school activities. She was originally trained as an actress, and starred in North Korea's first Technicolor film. In 1972, Kim was selected to present flowers to the senior South Korean delegate at the North-South talks in Pyongyang.Korea News Review, Volume 18, Issue 12, page 10, 1989 After graduating from high school, she initially enrolled at Kim Il Sung University, before transferring to the Pyongyang Foreign Language College, where she studied Japanese.A Bomber Repents, People, December 13, 1993 However, she had barely begun her studies when she was recruited for work.Kim Hyon-hui: The North Korean Spy Who Came In From The Cold War, International Business Times, 23 April 2013 Espionage training Soon after joining the North Korean intelligence agency, Kim was given a new name, Ok Hwa and sent to live in a compound outside of Pyongyang. There, Kim spent seven years learning spycraft. Her training included martial arts, physical fitness, and three years of Japanese.North Korean Super Spy, 7:30 Report, ABC, 10 April 2013 Kim's Japanese instructor was Yaeko Taguchi, one of many Japanese kidnapped by North Korea. Later, Kim testified that Taguchi was known to her as Lee Un-hae (ÊùéÊÅ©ÊÉ†, Î¶¨ÏùÄÌòú).Japanese Abduction Victim Still Alive, Says KAL Bomber , Chosun Ilbo January 16, 2009 Additionally, students at this facility were shown propaganda films. At the end of her training, Kim was rigorously tested. Part of her final exam required her to infiltrate and memorize a document from a mock embassy.The Tears of My Soul, Kim Hyon Hui, William Morrow and Co., 1993, page 52 She was trained in Macau to learn Cantonese so that she would be able to pose as Chinese when sent on overseas missions.The Tears of My Soul, Kim Hyon Hui, William Morrow and Co., 1993, page 69 They were also trained to shop in supermarkets, use credit cards and visit discos: amenities that did not exist in their homeland. Kim was then allowed to travel through Europe with an older man, known to her as Kim Seung-il (ÈáëÂãù‰∏Ä). This was part of her extensive preparation to complete a mission that was of great importance to the ruling Kim family.North Korea: Coming in from the Cold, Bertil Lintner, Yoon Suh- kyung, Far Eastern Economic Review, October 25, 2001 They flew first from Pyongyang to Moscow, from where they travelled to Budapest, where they were given fake Japanese passports and began posing as a father and daughter touring Europe together. Then they flew to Baghdad to prepare for the airplane bombing.  Korean Air Flight 858  In 1987, Kim was given an assignment to plant bombs on KAL 858. She was told that the order came directly from Kim Il- sung, and was handwritten.The Tears of My Soul, Kim Hyon Hui, William Morrow and Co., 1993, page 84 She was told that if she were successful, she would be able to return and live with her family and would not have to work as an agent afterward. She was once again paired with Kim Seung-il who was recovering from a stomach operation. She was traveling with a fake Japanese passport under the name of along with Kim Seung-il, who posed as her father and used the name . The two travelled through Europe and eventually met other North Korean agents in Belgrade who provided them with the materials to complete their mission. Once they had left the bomb behind (hidden in a radio device) in a luggage rack of KAL 858, Kim Hyon Hui and Kim Seung-il disembarked in Abu Dhabi and travelled to Bahrain. The two terrorists were apprehended in Bahrain after investigators discovered that their passports were fake. Kim Seung-il bit a cyanide pill that was hidden in a cigarette and died. Kim Hyon Hui attempted to do the same, but a Bahraini police officer snatched the cigarette out of her mouth before she could fully ingest the poison. She was hospitalized and then later interrogated. After Bahrain was convinced she was actually a North Korean, she was flown to Seoul, South Korea under heavy guard, bound and gagged.Shoot the Women First, Eileen MacDonald, Random House, 1991, page 35 At first, she insisted that her name was Pai Chui Hui, an orphan from northern China who had met an elderly Japanese man with whom she was travelling. She denied any sexual involvement with her partner Kim Seung-il. However, the fact that the only form of Chinese that she spoke, Cantonese, is a southern Chinese dialect, was inconsistent with her claimed northern Chinese origin.The Tears of My Soul, Kim Hyon Hui, William Morrow and Co., 1993, page 151 According to testimony at a United Nations Security Council meeting, Kim was taken on several occasions outside of her prison cell to see the prosperity of Seoul . The prison authorities also showed her TV shows and news reports showing the affluent lifestyle of South Koreans and the freedom for South Koreans to speak dissent and criticize their government. In North Korea, she had been taught that the South was a corruption-riddled fiefdom of the United States and that poverty was widespread. After eight days, Kim broke down, admitted that she was in fact a North Korean and confessed the details of her role in the bombing of Flight 858, as well as Kim Il-sung's personal involvement in the scheme.  Aftermath  For her role in the bombing of KAL 858, Kim was sentenced to death in March 1989. However, South Korean president Roh Tae-woo pardoned her later that year, saying that Kim was merely a brainwashed victim of the real culprit, the North Korean government. She later wrote an autobiography entitled The Tears of My Soul and donated the proceeds to the families of the victims of Flight 858.The Tears of My Soul, Kim Hyon Hui, William Morrow and Co., 1993, page 3 Publishers Weekly, in its 1992 review of the book Shoot the Women First by Eileen MacDonald, described Kim as \\"robot- like\\" and \\"wholly submissive to male authority\\".Shoot the Women First, Publishers Weekly, August 31, 1992 In an interview with Washington Post correspondent Don Oberdorfer, Kim said that she'd been led to believe the bombing was necessary to aid the cause of reuniting the peninsula. However, the sight of Seoul's prosperity made her realize she'd \\"committed the crime of killing compatriots.\\"The Two Koreas: A Contemporary History, Don Oberdorfer, Robert Carlin, Basic Books, 2013, page 145 In December 1997, Kim married a former South Korean intelligence agent who also served as her bodyguard, with whom she has two children. In March 2009, when meeting family members of Yaeko Taguchi, she mentioned that Taguchi may still be alive, and in connection with this she visited Japan in July 2010. After the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan, she donated one million yen ($15,600) to the victims, out of gratitude for the preferential treatment she had received in Japan during her previous visit.Ex-N. Korean spy donates a million yen to Japan, The Korea Herald/Asia News Network, March 24, 2011 She was also featured by a Japanese television documentary that dramatized her life and revealed how Taguchi used to sing lullabies to her children, from whom she had been separated after being abducted. Kim currently lives in an undisclosed location and remains under constant protection for fear of reprisals from the North Korean government.Secret Agent No 1, Journeyman Pictures, 2013 Kim has also offered analysis to news organizations about current affairs in North Korea. During the 2013 Korean crisis, Kim suggested on Australian television that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was too young and inexperienced, was \\"struggling to gain complete control over the military and to win their loyalty.\\" She also commented that he was \\"using the nuclear program as a bargaining chip for aid, to keep the public behind him.\\"Kim Jong-un 'struggling': former North Korean spy, Sydney Morning-Herald, 10 April 2013 In an interview with BBC, Kim said that North Korea just pretended to be friendly on the issue of 2018 Winter Olympics, and its priority still is the nuclear program.  Personal life  Kim married a former South Korean agent handling her case in 1997 and has two children. She lives in an undisclosed location in South Korea. According to a BBC interview in 2013, her family left behind in North Korea was arrested and sent to a labor camp.  Works  * Kim, Hyun Hee. The Tears of My Soul.

History Skyline of the Denver Tech Center. The DTC was established in the early 1970s. Cable companies United Cablevision, United Artists Cable, and later AT&T; Broadband, all had their start in - and still have major infrastructure around - the Denver Tech Center. In the Colorado area, Bill Daniels and John C. Malone were early adopters who shepherded many standards in cable technology still used today. The Denver Tech Center was designed by architect/planner Carl A. Worthington.Carl A. Worthington and Associates, http://www.carlworthingtonassociates.com In the early 1970s, investors asked Worthington to complete a conceptual master plan along a new fiber optic line south of downtown Denver. The master plan started with forty acres, with potential for an additional 800 acres. The plan has since grown to 850 acres, and over 25 million square feet of buildings have been completed.

Born in Delaware, Indiana, Perrine's parents were George and Sarah Burton Perrine, and he was a descendant of Daniel Perrin, \\"The Huguenot.\\" Idaho Perrine moved to Idaho Territory in 1884 and established a farm and ranch operation in the Snake River Canyon near present-day Jerome. He was a successful farmer and rancher who among other things received a gold medal for his fruit display at the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis. The ranch remained in the Perrine family until 1964, when it was sold and became part of Blue Lakes Country Club.Blue Lakes Country Club ‚Äì History Although Perrine's operation in the canyon received plenty of water, the surrounding area could not be easily irrigated and was therefore largely unproductive. Beginning in 1893, Perrine worked to convince private financiers to build a dam on the Snake River, along with a corresponding canal system to irrigate the area. This work culminated in the 1900 founding of the Twin Falls Land and Water Company and the subsequent completion of Milner Dam in 1905. After Twin Falls was founded in 1904, Perrine served as a bank president and owned a hotel in the new city.

He was born and grew up in Nebraska, where he worked for most of his adult life as a reputable grain buyer and dealer. He became a contactee after telling of his experience on November 5, 1957 detailed in his book Edge of Tomorrow, when while driving through a rural area near Kearney, Nebraska, he noticed a large, cigar-shaped object resting in a field. He was soon escorted inside the space ship, which turned out to be crewed by completely human-looking space aliens, four male and two female, who apparently spoke perfect German and claimed to be from the planet Saturn. \\"The Saturnians\\" also claimed to be interested in the recently launched Russian sputniks, and the satellite-launching plans of the US. Later Schmidt brought local police to view the \\"landing site,\\" where they found deep imprints and some \\"mysterious green residue\\". Like George Adamski and others, Schmidt also claims subsequent visits to the extraterrestrial space ship and many friendly conversations with its learned crew. Schmidt noticed they drank MJB (coffee), and also carried in their cigar-shaped craft an ordinary terrestrial MG sports car, which they used for running errands and buying groceries. (A schematic drawing of the ship's interior in Schmidt's later booklet depicts a Volkswagen Beetle, not an MG sports car.) Unlike most space ships the Saturnian ship had large propellers at both ends. Eventually Schmidt got the ride up to earth orbit, and tour of the mother ship, that almost all 1950s contactees report. Schmidt had joined up with Wayne Sulo Aho and John Otto on their lecture circuit across the US, within two months of his reported \\"first contact.\\" Unlike the majority of contactees, Schmidt did not seem interested in forming a religious cult, although the Saturnians had the usual Space-Brotherly religious message and revealed that they had been around to help Jesus, a Venusian, in his mission to earth. Schmidt relocated to Bakersfield, California, where he continued to present lectures for the next few years, recounting his other-worldly experiences and later sought out elderly women who had been in his audiences and whose addresses he had obtained. He told them that in his rides in the space ship he had observed the location of valuable mineral deposits, including a unique form of quartz crystal which could cure cancer. Having exhausted his funds in purchasing the site, he now needed quick cash to begin mining the crystals and demonstrating their healing properties. Most of the women he approached quickly came up with several thousand dollars apiece to aid his \\"space-directed\\" mission. He collected sums approaching $30,000 before his arrest and conviction on charges of grand theft. Little is known about his later career, except that after his release from prison, he returned to Nebraska. In 1963, before his legal troubles began, he self-published a booklet, My Contact With the Spacepeople. He also promoted the making of a short, low-budget film which dramatizes his supposed visits to the Saturnian space ship. The film, Edge of Tomorrow, begins with Schmidt being interviewed by an actor resembling Long John Nebel. In flashback we see his visit to the space ship and his chats with the Saturnians, including the ship's captain, \\"Mr. X,\\" and two very fetching Space Girls dressed much like Carol and Tonga of Space Patrol. Schmidt's booklet was retitled Edge of Tomorrow to match the film, illustrated with stills from the film, and was clearly intended to be sold to audience members before or after showings of the film. The booklet is still in print. According to the booklet, while in the space cigar Schmidt had looked at some notebooks which contained prophecies for our earth covering the period 1958 to 1998, \\"the end of the present Earth Cycle.\\" No details are given and Schmidt did not launch a new career as prophet. Schmidt had clearly also just been reading George Hunt Williamson's Secret Places of the Lion (1958), because he recounts how \\"Mr. X\\" once took him to the Great Pyramid, and to a secret underground chamber where he got a look at the small flying saucer Jesus had used to come to Earth from his native Venus 2000 years ago and later used to return to Venus. \\"Mr. X\\" himself had brought the saucer back to store in the Pyramid.

This was the third episode of the eighth season. It was originally broadcast on the NBC network on October 3, 1996. The title and plot extensively reference the Bizarro (the polar opposite of Superman) and Bizarro-Earth concepts that originally appeared in various comic books published by DC Comics. This episode introduced the phrase \\"man-hands\\".  Plot  Elaine breaks up with her boyfriend Kevin, but they decide to remain friends. Kevin proves to be a much more reliable friend than Jerry. Jerry suggests to Elaine that Kevin is \\"Bizarro Jerry\\", and explains how the Superman character Bizarro does everything in an opposite manner. While using the restrooms at a company called Brandt/Leland, Kramer aids an employee with a scanner and is mistaken for a co-worker by the staff. He begins showing up at regular work hours with no contract and no pay, simply appreciating the structure that a steady job adds to his life. Kramer is \\"fired\\" by Leland because of his incomprehensible work. Jerry starts dating Gillian, an attractive woman whose only flaw is that she has \\"man-hands\\", i.e. her hands are large and coarse like a man's. George gets into a club of attractive female models by saying that a photo of Gillian is his late fiancee Susan. He accidentally burns the picture with a hair dryer. Jerry breaks up with Gillian due to her hands. While Jerry tries to get another picture of her from her purse for George, she grabs Jerry's hand, crushing it. Jerry becomes bored at home, now that Kramer is working, Elaine is hanging out with Kevin and his friends Gene and Feldman (Bizarro versions of George and Kramer, respectively), and George refuses to bring him along to the club. George tries to use a picture of a model from a magazine to get back into the club, but he accidentally approaches the same model from the magazine picture and is kicked out. Jerry, George, and Kramer head to the coffee shop and bump into Elaine as she is meeting up with Kevin, Gene, and Feldman. Elaine decides to stay with her \\"Bizarro friends.\\" But they reject her when they do not take to some of the things she usually does with Jerry, such as eating olives directly out of the jar from Kevin's refrigerator without asking first, and pushing Kevin so hard that he falls. George takes Jerry to the location of the club, but all they find is a meat packing plant, with the photo George took from a magazine lying amidst the sawdust. Production David Mandel wrote the episode after his then girlfriend Rebecca ended their long-distance relationship. Rebecca, now wife of Mandel, was self-conscious about what she calls her \\"farm-hands\\". Part of the new generation of Seinfeld writers who were fans of the show prior to working on it, Mandel saw the opportunity to include such self-referential \\"meta\\" humor as the Bizarro characters, as they could rely on audiences being familiar enough with the series to understand the jokes. Mandel has since described it as his favorite episode of the series. The episode's Kramer story was inspired by how Mandel often assisted customers at Tower Records who mistakenly thought he worked there. An acquaintance of Mandel's was so ashamed of how physically unattractive the woman who dumped him was, when talking about her he would show a photo of a different woman, inspiring the George story. The \\"man hands\\" are all close-ups of a male crew member's hands, while actress Kristin Bauer van Straten's real hands were kept off-camera.  Critical reception  In a review of two adjacent episodes, David Sims of The A.V. Club writes, \\"The Bizarro Jerry and The Little Kicks are probably two of the better-known season 8 episodes and for good reason ‚Äì they're a lot of fun.\\" Sims speculates that \\"The Bizarro Jerry just reeks of a concept that Seinfeld wanted to do forever, given his obsession with Superman, and finally got the chance to once he was fully in charge of the show... Elaine finds that Kevin...and his friends are like a weird mirror group to her friends. But it's very effectively staged that it works, even once the joke has become totally familiar ‚Äì the idea of characters having strange doubles is now one of the oldest sitcom tropes in the book... Elaine, of course, quickly realizes that the bizarro universe is not for her... the whole time she's more of an interested party than anything, examining the bizarro gang like a scientist.\\" Of the \\"man-hands\\" segments, Sims says, \\"Like many a good Seinfeld episode, there's a B-plot nestled in here that feels like the dominant A-plot of another episode, considering what a major meme it became.\\" John J. O'Connor of The New York Times also explained why he found the episode fun: \\"Bizarro Jerry has found Elaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) entering a world of virtual reality with a new boyfriend who eerily resembled Jerry except that he was reliable and considerate. Moreover, his friends were physical clones of George and Kramer (Michael Richards). 'It's like Superman's opposite,' observed Jerry, pinpointing the bizarro of the title. Meanwhile, Jerry was dating a beautiful young woman whose only flaw (flaws are inevitable on Seinfeld) was having man's hands: meaty paws, whined Jerry, 'like a creature out of Greek mythology.' Kramer drifted incomprehensibly into a corporate job in which he 'finally found structure' and was able to strut about with a briefcase full of Ritz crackers.\\"  References   External links  * * Category:Seinfeld (season 8) episodes Category:1996 American television episodes Category:Television episodes written by David Mandel ","title":"The Bizarro Jerry"},{"id":"4816049","text":"The Dete train crash was a railway accident which occurred on 1 February 2003 in the Zimbabwean town of Dete in the Western part of the country about from Victoria Falls. The accident involved the collision of a crowded passenger train and an industrial transport carrying tankers full of a highly flammable liquid to a coal mine on the Bulawayo to Victoria Falls line. The fast passenger train, which was carrying over 1,100 passengers reportedly collided with the slower freight train after a signalling failure. The train left the tracks, eleven carriages being thrown in the air or overturned. Flammable materials inside the carriages then caught fire spreading to the industrial goods train. Although the fire did quickly consume both of the trains, the Zimbabwean Civil Protection Unit arrived quickly, and were able to rescue many of those trapped before the flames reached them. Total casualties were reported to be 50 killed and 64 seriously injured in the crash, with well over one hundred minor injuries. All the casualties were transferred to a hospital in Hwange, which is situated in the area. Robert Mugabe's state censorship of the media meant that all news reports announced that the disaster was the result of a foreign boycott of Zimbabwean products, which had led to severely limited foreign currency reserves, so that trains were over crowded because motor transport cannot get fuel and that railway equipment is outdated because the repairs need cannot be paid for. Many news outlets also hinted that the crash may have been the result of sabotage by the rival party in Zimbabwe, Movement for Democratic Change, a stance treated with severe doubt in foreign press articles. The crash was most likely the result of out-of-date and poorly maintained equipment on the Zimbabwe railway breaking down, which meant that the signal instruction intended to warn the approaching passenger train of the presence of the slow train ahead was never received by the signal and thus never displayed, resulting in the accident.

He was the founder of the first Diocese of the lands surrounding Lake M√§laren, today the Diocese of Str√§ngn√§s. He is the patron saint of S√∂dermanland and the Diocese of Str√§ngn√§s. Saint Eskil was sent as a Missionary Bishop to the Lake M√§laren landscapes by Saint Sigfrid of V√§xj√∂ along with Saint Botvid and Saint David. Botvid lies buried in Botkyrka, today a suburb of Stockholm in the east of S√∂dermanland. All three saints are known to have perished trying to Christianize the people living around Lake M√§laren and both Eskil and Botvid have been made patron saints of S√∂dermanland County. David has been made patron saint of V√§ster√•s and the province of V√§stmanland. They all are sources of several medieval legends. Saint Eskil made the village of Tuna (present day Eskilstuna) his missionary diocese and later, around 1080, he made a 30 kilometre journey east of Tuna to Str√§ngn√§s, an Old Norse holy place. Saint Eskil was stoned to death, according to tradition, because he disrupted a holy ritual. Saint Eskil's followers decided to take his corpse back to Tuna. The local tradition says that during that journey, his body was placed on the ground and that a miraculous spring gushed from that spot, and started to flow out of the mountain side just outside Str√§ngn√§s. The spring is known as the Spring of Saint Eskil. Saint Eskil was buried in his monastery in Tuna. Str√§ngn√§s was later converted into Christianity and the diocese that Eskil had created in Tuna was moved or re-created in Str√§ngn√§s. Veneration Str√§ngn√§s Cathedral was later built on the same site of the pagan ritual Eskil had observed. This is confirmed, since the hill where the Cathedral now stands is known to have been the ritual site and that the first wooden church built there was dedicated to Saint Eskil. The old church and burial site of Saint Eskil in Tuna later became one of the first monasteries in the region. When Tuna got priviligies, \\"Eskil\\" was added into the name, creating Eskilstuna. Eskil probably lived during the reign of King Inge the Elder at the end of the 11th century. According to the source closest in time, a legend of the Danish king Saint Canute, authored about 1122 by √Ülnoth from Canterbury, an Anglo- Saxon priest who had settled in Denmark, an \\"Eskillinus\\", an English bishop of noble origins, was killed by the \\"wild barbarians\\" (specified as the Suethi et Gothi, i.e. Swedes and Geats) among whom he was preaching the gospel. In its more developed form, the legend of Eskil is attested from the 13th century and known from a few different sources: according to this, he was successful in his mission during the reign of King Inge, but killed by Blot-Sweyn when trying to stop a pagan sacrifice on the hill where the Str√§ngn√§s Cathedral now stands. He is said to have been killed by stoning and with axes, and the stones later became his attribute. The legend shows stylistic influence from various sources, including the legend of Saint Olaf of Norway. The veneration of Eskil spread in Sweden and to Denmark (Odense) and Norway (Trondheim). Eskil's feast (and purported day of death) was on 11 June, but it was later moved, except in the Diocese of Str√§ngn√§s, to June 12 in order not to collide with the Feast of Barnabas. Relics of Eskil existed in the church of Eskilstuna, which was traditionally seen as his burial place, as well as in other churches within the Diocese of Str√§ngn√§s, elsewhere in Sweden, and in Roskilde and Copenhagen in Denmark.

Among those transferred were Dr. Wernher von Braun and his team of German scientists and technicians who had come to the United States after World War II. The Von Braun team is most noted for its pioneering efforts in helping the Army at Redstone lay the foundation for U.S. space exploration. With the transfer of the Von Braun team to NASA in 1960, research and development activities by the Army at Redstone turned to integrating space-age technology into weapons for the Soldier in the field. = Name changes = * 1962 - The U.S. Army Missile Command (MICOM), including the Directorate of Research and Development, was activated. * 1965 - Redesignated the Research and Development Directorate. * 1968 - Redesignated the Research and Engineering (R&E;) Directorate. * 1971 - Redesignated the Directorate for Research, Development, Engineering, and Missile Systems Laboratory (RDE&MSL;). * 1972 - Redesignated the Army Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Laboratory (MRDEL). * 1977 - With the establishment of the U.S. Army Missile Research and Development Command (MIRADCOM), the Technology Laboratory and the Engineering Laboratory were born. * 1979 - Reorganized/redesignated as the Army Missile Laboratory (AML) as part of the shift from the dual to the merged command structure of the reinstituted MICOM.

The lighthouse was the first to be built within the state of New York, and was the first public works project of the new United States. It is the fourth oldest active lighthouse in the United States. Long listed on the National Register of Historic Places, in 2012, it was designated as a National Historic Landmark for its significance to New York and international shipping in the early Federal period. The lighthouse, which is located on Turtle Hill at the easternmost tip of Long Island, at 2000 Montauk Highway, is a privately run museum, and is not part of Montauk Point State Park. Entry to the lighthouse costs $10.00 for an adult, $8.00 for seniors and $5.00 per child. History Montauk Point, New York Public Library shields of each of Long Island's state parkways. Montauk Light was the first lighthouse in New York State, and is the fourth-oldest active lighthouse in the United States. The tower is 110'6\\" high. The current light, installed in July 2001, equivalent to approximately 290,000 candle power, flashes every 5 seconds and can be seen a distance of . Construction on the lighthouse was authorized by the Second United States Congress, under President George Washington on April 12, 1792. Ezra L'Hommedieu, a prominent lawyer, member of the Continental Congress,Mac Griswold, The Manor: Three Centuries at a Slave Plantation on Long Island, New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2013, p. 263 and a man with scientific interests, consulted with Washington on its construction. He represented the New York City Chamber of Commerce on discussions related to the lighthouse. He made the case that New York City \\"was first among American ports in the volume of its foreign commerce. By 1797, the harbor was handling a third of the nation's trade with other countries.\\"Russell Drumm, \\"Turning a Montauk Beacon Into a Landmark\\", Easthampton Star, 2 June 2011, accessed 4 December 2013 Due to prevailing winds in winter, shippers approaching from sea needed a lighthouse at the end of Long Island to guide them along the south side into New York harbor. L'Hommedieu chose the site for the lighthouseHenry Osmer, \\"Montauk Point Lighthouse Awarded National Landmark Status\\", Lighthouse Digest, Sep-Oct 2012, accessed 4 December 2012 and designed it. The project began on June 7, 1796, and was completed on November 5, 1796, the first public works project of the new United States of America. Sometime in early April 1797, keeper Jacob Hand lit the wicks in the lamps in the tower, and the lighthouse began operation. It continued under civilian keepers until World War II, when the US Army took it over. See also: In 1860 the lighthouse station underwent a massive renovation when two new levels and a larger lantern were added. This increased the height of the tower from its original 80 feet (1796) to its current height of 110' 6\\". A first-order Fresnel lens‚Äî12 foot high, 6 feet in diameter, and weighing about 10,000 pounds‚Äîwas installed in the new lantern; the current keeper's dwelling was constructed adjacent to the tower, and the original 1796 dwelling demolished. A steam-powered fog signal was installed in 1873, with a fog signal building in 1897. The tower was originally all white; its single brown stripe was added in 1899. A fourth- order fixed red range-light was added to the watch deck of the tower in 1903 to warn of Shagwong Reef, a navigational hazard about 3 miles northwest of the lighthouse. This light was severely damaged in the hurricane of September 21, 1938 and removed on July 1, 1940 when the lighthouse was electrified. The huge first-order Fresnel lens was replaced in 1903 with a 3 order bivalve Fresnel lens, which served until February 3, 1987, when it was replaced with an airport beacon with a strength of 2.5 million candela. During World War II, the lighthouse was taken over by the U.S. Army as part of the Eastern Coastal Defense Shield. The last three civilian keepers‚ÄîThomas Buckridge, Jack Miller, and George Warrington‚Äîdeparted in the spring of 1943. Adjacent to the lighthouse, Camp Hero, opened by the Army in 1942, had two 16 inch gun batteries of two guns each, and a battery of two six-inch guns. The casemates, gun emplacements and concrete fire control towers (which are also at nearby Shadmoor State Park) are still visible. In 1946 the United States Coast Guard took over maintenance of the lighthouse and operated it until the station was automated on February 3, 1987. In May of that year, the lighthouse museum opened to the public, operated by the Montauk Historical Society. It leased the property from the US Coast Guard for that purpose. On September 30, 1996 President Bill Clinton signed legislation transferring the lighthouse property to the Montauk Historical Society. The tower was built on Turtle Hill from the edge of the cliff; due to the cumulative effects of shoreline erosion, it is now away from the edge. After World War II, the United States Army Corps of Engineers built a seawall at its base, but the erosion continued. The Coast Guard considered tearing down the lighthouse in 1967 and replacing it with a steel tower further from the edge of the bluff. In the wake of protests over the announced dismantling of the tower, Congressman Michael Forbes proposed a bill to the United States Congress to hand over the Lighthouse to the Montauk Historical Society from the Public so it could be preserved;Montauk Point Lighthouse Museum (Local Legacies) the bill was passed. Giorgina Reid (1908‚Äì2001), a textile designer, had saved her Rocky Point, New York cottage from collapse by building a simple set of terraces in the gullies of the bluff. She proposed that solution to the Society at Montauk. Reid's concept, Reed-Trench Terracing, called for building the terrace platforms made of various beach debris, notably reeds; the practice (along with further strengthening of the rocks at the bluff toe) appeared to stem the erosion. She patented the process and published an article about it titled \\"How to Hold up a Bank\\".\\"Against All Odds: A Lighthouse Looks To The Future\\", Greg Donohue, Official Montauk Lighthouse website, (archive) Greg Donohue, a Montauk landscaper, worked with Giorgina Reid at the Point and kept the project moving forward after she retired in 1986. With support from various sources, including the Montauk Historical Society and the State of New York, the Erosion Control Project of Montauk Point was successfully completed in 1998. However, the recurrence of the erosion threat in ensuing years has prompted further action: In November 2006, the United States Army Corps of Engineers' plan to build another seawall was opposed by a local surfing group, who contended that a seawall would ruin the nearby world-renowned surf break. They proposed moving the lighthouse back from the shore, as was done with the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse. Complicating such a move is the terrain, which would require the lighthouse to be moved down one hill and up another. Environmental groups have raised concerns that reducing the erosion at Montauk would increase erosion at other Long Island beaches, as there are always related effects to such infrastructure work. On March 2, 2012 United States Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar officially designated the lighthouse as a National Historic Landmark; it is the 14th site on Long Island and the 11th lighthouse in the country to be so recognized. Suffolk Transit's S94 bus route serves the lighthouse seasonally, connecting it with Montauk Village. Pirate Captain Kidd was said to have buried treasure at the foot of the lighthouse site around 1699 at two ponds which today are called \\"Money Ponds.\\"Pirates and Prohibition - Excerpted From East Hampton History, by Jeannette Edwards Rattroy - 1953 (republished on longislandgeneology.com - Retrieved 2007-01-12) Gallery File:Look_out_from_top_LH.JPGView from the top of the lighthouse File:Montauk Point Lighthouse 2008.jpeg File:Montaukpointlight.jpg File:Montauk Point Lighthouse.jpg File:Montauk Lighthouse on NOAA chart.jpgMontauk Point Lighthouse, on a NOAA nautical chart References Notes Further reading Books by Henry Osmers, published by Outskirts Press: *On Eagle's Beak: A History of the Montauk Point Lighthouse, 2008. *Living on the Edge: Life at the Montauk Point Lighthouse 1930‚Äì1945, 2009. *They Were All Strangers: the Wreck of the John Milton at Montauk, New York, 2010. *American Gibraltar: Montauk and the Wars of America, 2011.

The arboretum is open from dawn to dusk and the admission is free. Although the climate of the Ottawa area is Zone 5a, the topography of the Arboretum produces a microclimate and is warmer by one zone. This has allowed for a collection of magnolias, azaleas, and several other fringe trees including Metasequoia and Liriodendron. One of the favourite attractions for tourists is the Ornamental Gardens. In this area are located the annual plant display, perennial borders, lilac walks, roses and hedges.

It is currently the home of the University of Kentucky's staff, faculty, and alumni club, which was founded in 1962. History of Spindletop Hall On November 14, 1925, Frank Yount struck oil at the Spindletop field in Beaumont, Texas. The field, which had basically played out since its original discovery on January 10, 1901, produced from new strata over of oil an acre per year, pumping in excess of within 5 years. Now financially secure, Miles Frank and wife, Pansy, established in Beaumont a stable of American Saddlebred horses, quickly becoming recognized as a leader in the industry.A History of Spindletop Hall Retrieved 2013-01-06 One day shy of the eighth anniversary of Spindletop's second discovery, Frank Yount died of a heart attack at age 53 on November 13, 1933. Left as the beneficiary of great wealth, Yount's widow, Pansy, mired in controversy in Beaumont, chose Kentucky as the place she would start anew. Spindletop Farm was established in 1935 on of land, known previously as Shoshone Stud Farm, owned by W. R. Coe. At a cost of one million dollars, construction of Spindletop Hall began in 1935 and took two years to complete. Mrs. Yount deemed the house to be a showplace of Kentucky, a modern mansion of classical architecture. When completed, the mansion housed 40 rooms, each with its own thermostat, 14 bathrooms, 133 full-size exterior and interior doors, 102 windows with screens of copper, and 11 fireplaces, all encompassing over of floor space. At the time of its construction, the circular staircase and the 30X60 foot living room were the largest in Kentucky. Eventually, Mrs. Yount expanded the farm to . On the property were seven miles (11 km) of metal fences, 17 houses for servants and farm hands, and 18 barns. There was a greenhouse, swimming pool, bath house, tennis court, two aviaries, and three kennels. Pansy Yount lived at Spindletop Hall with her adopted daughter, Mildred, and William Capers \\"Cape\\" Grant, her third husband and horse trainer. She was considered \\"new money\\" by the Kentucky Blue Bloods and was never accepted into their social circle. In early 1959, Spindletop Farm was sold/donated to The University of Kentucky for $850,000. Mrs. Yount died in 1962. Also in 1962, Spindletop Hall became the residence of the University of Kentucky Faculty, Staff, and Alumni Club. The club's roster has grown from around 500 memberships to nearly 1800 families and individuals. Inside the mansion =The main floor= Grand Entrance Hall At the time the house was constructed, the heavy bronze doors which grace the foyer (and a similar pair which open from the library to the porte-cochere) cost $14,000. The original imported rug was designed to match the elaborately molded plaster ceiling. The fretwork panels in the stairwells serve as echo chambers for the four keyboard Kimball organ in the music room. Slipcovers, which the owner never removed (this is also true for all draperies in the mansion), hid the Italian velvet draperies. The massive bronze chandelier, which was designed in Europe, was made in three separate sections. The wall panels were handpainted in themes representative of mythology. Music Room To the right of the Grand Entrance Hall is the Music Room. The Show Cabinet adjacent to the fireplace wall encased two Stradivarius violins, among other quality musical instruments like a Welte-Kimball automatic organ. The walls are burled mahogany with ceramic trim. The mantel is made of imported marble. An Aubosson carpet (since replaced) complemented the paneled walls. The crystal chandeliers and wall sconces were made in Czechoslovakia. Library Steps lead from the music room to the Library. There were in excess of 7,000 volumes here prior to Mrs. Yount's donation of the property. The current collection is courtesy of gifts from the membership of Spindletop.

Tatras are primarily considered livestock guardian dogs. Their instinct, through hundreds of years of breeding, is to protect livestock, though they easily adopt a family as a flock. They are a good companion dog as well as a protection dog. They are not an attack dog, but rather move threats away through intimidation. They have a loud bark. They are not all that similar in temperament to their livestock guardian dog cousins the Kuvasz, Great Pyrenees or Maremma Sheepdog. They are less aloof than the other breeds, tending to be better tied into their breeding and not as domesticated or inbred as some of their cousins. In the USA the Tatra sheepdog is considered a rare breed. It is not recognized by the AKC.

It was so popular because, as its name implies, it was a fantastic sheepdog. This success at herding sheep was mainly due to their high intelligence. When predators were around the sheep, the Polish Tatra Sheepdog would gather up the sheep and stand by them instead of trying to attack the predator, which would leave the sheep open for other attacks, thus demonstrating their intelligence. Their white coat also made them easily distinguishable from a bear or wolves, which was very helpful for workers. Also, owners could shave the dogs and use their coat to produce wool. Mountain workers also used to hold their tails while they lead the workers through the mountains and rough terrain. Herding sheep was not the only job the breed could perform. They were often used as personal guards and frequently guarded factories and other private property. On top of this, it was often the case that the breed was used by the police force.\\"Polish Tatra Sheepdog History,\\" polishtatrasheepdog.ca, http://www.polishtatrasheepdog.ca/breed-history.php The breed faced some hard times, though. After the World Wars the breed was on the brink of extinction.

Health The Polish Tatra Sheepdog is generally a very healthy dog with very few health risks. The average life expectancy for this breed is usually 10‚Äì12 years old. As with most large breed dogs, the Polish Tatra Sheepdog can occasionally get hip dysplasia. Temperament A lot of today's Polish Tatra Sheepdog's behaviors and qualities can be traced back to its use of guarding. They are territorial, loyal and protective of their owners, and are very good watchdogs for this reason. They have a very loud bark and will bark at anything that is suspicious, as they are trying to protect their family. Since they were trained to be cautious and not attack until completely necessary when predators were around sheep, The Polish Tatra Sheepdog will not bite a stranger or other animals unless continuously provoked, leading them to be considered very dog and animal friendly. From thousands of years of guarding sheep, they are very intelligent, calm and independent. Maintenance After thousands of years of running around sheep, the Polish Tatra Sheepdog has a good amount of energy and needs a decently large fenced yard to run around in. It is not a good apartment dog because of its size and amount of energy. They are not very active inside, but are very active outside. This is why constant walks are recommended. During late spring and early winter, the Polish Tatra Sheepdog sheds its undercoat profusely. The Polish Tatra Sheepdog is very intelligent, independent and needs a person well-experienced in positive reinforcement operant conditioning to train.

Biography William Roberts McDaniel was born in Talbot County, Maryland. He was the youngest child of a non-traditional family having two brothers, five sisters, two half-brothers, and two half-sisters. His father, John Wesley Sedgewick McDaniel, was first married to Sarah Wrightson before marrying her sister, Ann. It was Ann who later gave birth to William and his siblings. When he was just sixteen and a sophomore, McDaniel matriculated into Western Maryland College. Upon graduation in 1880, McDaniel earned the position of salutatorian of his class. McDaniel was an active member of the College's Alumni Association and received recognition for his outstanding service to his alma mater. Interrupting his doctorate from Johns Hopkins University and his studies with world-renowned British mathematician James Joseph Sylvester in 1885, he returned to school as a professor to fill in for Professor W.J. Thomas, who was ill. Thomas died three months after McDaniel took over, solidifying the position for McDaniel. After that, McDaniel continued to teach for 36 years. In 1888, after spending a summer at Harvard studying anatomy, hygiene, and gymnastics, McDaniel invented Club swinging, a form of exercise, which was discussed in his book Club Swinging by Note: A Method of Recording and Teaching Club Swings. McDaniel was made treasurer of Western Maryland College in 1894 and maintained this position up until his death. In 1894, William McDaniel and Ada Smith were married in the home of Ada's brother in Westminster, Maryland. They lived in a home built by McDaniel College and located on its campus. This is where they raised their only child, Dorothy. McDaniel became vice president and acting president of McDaniel College in 1906 but declined the position of presidency in 1920 on account of his failing health.

The park is in size, running from Montauk Highway north to Block Island Sound and is bordered on the east by Montauk Point State Park. Montauk County Park was created from 1971 to 1986 through a series of land acquisitions by Suffolk County with the help of Hilda Lindley and the Concerned Citizens of Montauk. http://www.ccom-montauk.org/ It was named for Theodore Roosevelt in 1998 to commemorate the centennial anniversary of his return to Long Island following the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, however it was re-named \\"Montauk County Park\\" in 2014 after concerns were raised about the insignificance of Roosevelt's actual involvement with the area. The park includes: * Big Reed Pond ‚Äì a National Natural Landmark. * Montaukett Village ‚Äì a home and burial ground of the Montaukett tribe of Native Americans, which includes the grave of member Stephen Talkhouse * Deep Hollow Ranch ‚Äì the first cattle ranch in the United States, established in 1658 * Third House ‚Äì the third residence constructed in the 18th century for cattle keepers, who brought cattle to graze in Montauk each summer.

Its ecosystem is at the confluence between fresh water and brackish water, as the pond is fresh water but some of the wetlands that border it are brackish. The local sandy soil and high rates of precipitation create a fragile homeostatic balance between fresh water and saltwater. The maintenance of the County Park as open space helps to maintain this balance.  Montaukett Village  Stephen Talkhouse The Montaukett tribe originally occupied this area of Long Island. In the late 17th century Chief Wyandanch gave much of the South Fork of Long Island to Lion Gardiner. The remaining Montauk were still living in the area until the Montauk peninsula was purchased by Arthur Bensen in 1879. The ruins of a sweat lodge and part of the village are still visible. The Pharaoh Museum is located in a small cabin near Third House and contains displays of the tools and pottery used by the Montaukett. Stephen Talkhouse, whose round trip walks of inspired the Paumanok Path, is buried in the cemetery.  Deep Hollow Ranch  Deep Hollow Ranch sign Deep Hollow Ranch claims to be the birthplace of the American cowboy, as it was founded as a cattle ranch in 1658. It has been operating continuously ever since; in the 21st century it offers horseback riding and hay rides. From 1990 through 1999, Deep Hollow Ranch was the site of several \\"Back at the Ranch\\" concerts to raise funds for local charities. Most of the events were produced with the help of singer‚Äìsongwriter Paul Simon, who owns a home near the ranch. The summer concerts had performers including The Allman Brothers Band, Edie Brickell, James Brown, Jimmy Buffett, The Cars, Ray Charles, Foreigner, Don Henley, The Highwaymen, Billy Joel, Lyle Lovett, Paul Simon and James Taylor, drawing as many as 10,000 attendees to each event.  Third House  Montauk Third House Running from west to east, First House, Second House and Third House were the first residences constructed on the eastern tip of Long Island after the keeper's quarters at Montauk Point Lighthouse. They were built in the 18th century for the cattle keepers who drove horses, sheep, and cattle to graze in Montauk each year from May through November. During the summers, as many as 6,000 cattle, horses and sheep roamed pastures in Montauk, having been brought from as far west as Patchogue, a distance of approximately . First House was located near what is now Hither Hills State Park in Napeague and no longer exists. Second House is located at the west end of Montauk village and is now operated as a museum. Third House is used as the headquarters of Deep Hollow Ranch. In 1879 Arthur Bensen bought virtually all of the land on the eastern end from Napeague to Montauk Point. The purchase was intended to force the Montaukett off the land. Benson made Third House his residence, hoping to develop the area as a summer resort following Austin Corbin's extension of the Long Island Rail Road to Montauk.  Camp Wikoff  Benson failed to realize his plans. He sold much of the land to the federal government for Army, Navy, and eventually Air Force, bases. Camp Wikoff, constructed on of land, was used to quarantine 29,000 soldiers, including Theodore Roosevelt and the Rough Riders, at the conclusion of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War to prevent the spread of yellow fever and other tropical diseases. It was named for Col. Charles A. Wikoff of the 22nd U.S. Infantry, who was killed in the San Juan Heights assaults of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. During World War II, sections of Camp Wikoff were developed for massive gun emplacements and concrete observation bunkers as part of the New York coastal defense. During the Cold War, a large radar tower was built at the Camp Hero section. Later the camp was abandoned by the military and sectioned off in three state parks. Three state parks that include portions of the federal military complex and its infrastructure have been established: * Montauk Point State Park * Camp Hero State Park * Shadmoor State Park Other portions of the camp were sold to private developers. Third House, formerly Camp Wikoff headquarters, now serves as the park headquarters. It contains a Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War exhibit with photo and memorabilia from the war and Roosevelt‚Äôs disbanding of the Rough Riders. Camp Wikoff is open to the public May through October.

North Wales The community beat manager () title has also been adopted by North Wales Police in their Neighbourhood Policing Plan to identify their community police officers. The officer's role is similar to the Lancashire Constabulary model, the officers in North Wales also have responsibilities to manage and task PCSOs, Special Constables and Volunteers. The teams manage Community Action Plans and are accountable to their local communities. These action plans can cover a wide range of community-based problems from anti- social behaviour to environmental concerns such as graffiti removal. All residents in North Wales can identify and find contact details for their Neighbourhood Policing Teams via the North Wales Police website.

Ethyl macadamiate is used in some cosmetic formulations.  Chemical structure  Ethyl macadamiate is a mixture of the ethyl esters of the free fatty acids produced by the complete saponification of macadamia oil. The primary constituents of ethyl macadamiate are ethyl oleate and ethyl palmitoleate.  Physical properties  Ethyl macadamiate is a clear, colorless liquid at room temperature, with a typical fatty ester odor. Ethyl macadamiate's melting (congealing) point is and its specific gravity is 0.88. Ethyl macadamiate spreads very aggressively, and has a light, nongreasy dry skinfeel similar to that of some silicone derivatives, however, ethyl macadamiate is non-volatile.  Uses  Ethyl macadamiate is used in cosmetics, especially in skincare, haircare and suncare formulation. The dry skinfeel and high spread make ethyl macadamiate well suited for increasing sunscreen coverage. Ethyl macadamiate is an alternative to cyclomethicone and dimethicone as a skinfeel modifier where a botanical, nonvolatile and/or lipid-soluble substance is preferred.

These Arboretums are demonstrations of American gardening which did not come into its own until the late 19th century. With Industrialization, cities grew in size with a need for natural areas, which were included through the creation of public parks. Views of botanical gardens began to change as they became sources for new material of potential horticultural use rather than only public spaces. Today these spaces act in the propagation of plants that have the potential as attractive and functional ornamentals. The Arboretum is open all year round to the public from dawn to dusk. There are 73,500 visitors per year. It is used for teaching, research and many other events. There are many university courses, school programs, adult workshops and preregistered group walking tours held at the Arboretum. It is also a popular place for weddings, dinner theatre or memorial services and dedications. There are many walks and tours offered to see the large diversity of plants. As of 2020, the Aboretum is maintained by the Director, Justine Richardson, as well as over 100 volunteers from the University of Guelph and the Guelph community.

It was built in 1923, renovated to the former state in 1939, 1948 and 1954 and had a capacity of 30,000. Due to safety reasons this was reduced to 15,000 from 1994 onwards. It was used, mostly, for football matches of Rot-Weiss Essen and concerts. The stadium was demolished by August 2012. In 1920, the predecessor of Rot-Weiss Essen bought a piece of land at the PH√∂nixstrasse (which was later renamed to Hafenstrasse). After the purchase it appeared that the land was too short to build a stadium. In the years after, the club purchased the remaining lands and construction of the stadium began. In 1923 the club built three stands, which could hold 10,00 spectators. In 1939 the club built a new stadium on the same location, allowing the capacity to grow to roughly 27,000. During the Second World War the stadium was heavily damaged. In 1948 the renovation and reconstruction of it was finished and in the early 1950s Rot-Weiss Essen planned on building a new multifunctional main stand. The ideas behind this new main stand would be a revolution on the European mainland. Georg Melches had a vision a multifunctional stand, in which a sporthall, a sauna, offices, residential units, commercial units and a press room were present. The construction would be made out of concrete and in 1954 the building was officially inaugurated. German and European papers were positive on these developments and even called the stadium the German Highbury, as an example to Arsenal's former stadium. In 1952 Rot-Weiss Essen won the German Cup and in 1954 it won the German national championship. In 1956 Georg Melches and Rot- Weiss Essen installed the first floodlight installation of West Germany. The stadium was an example for other stadiums. Due to medical conditions, Georg Melches stepped down and died in 1963. In 1964 Rot-Weiss Essen renamed the stadium to the Georg Melches Stadion. After Melches‚Äô death, Rot-Weiss Essen couldn't have the same successes as in the 1950s. It also appeared that all the club's money was invested in the stadium and the club had troubles in investing the little money left in new players. When West Germany was chosen as hosts for the 1974 FIFA World Cup, the club hoped investors and the municipality of Essen would invest into the stadium to make it a host for the World Cup. This didn't happen and rivals Schalke 04 and Borussia Dortmund built a new stadium to host matches for the World Cup. With the little money left, Rot-Weiss Essen invested in renovating the stadium in 1975. Relegation from the 1. Bundesliga in 1977 and financial problems forced the club to sell the Georg Melches Stadium to Essen in 1979. The municipality of Essen invested almost nothing in the renovation of the stadium and due to safety reasons parts of the stadium were closed down and demolished in 1994. The capacity was reduced to 15,000. In 2010 it was announced that Rot-Weiss Essen would build a new stadium 100 meters from the Georg Melches Stadion. One of the stands was cut into half, leaving the stadium with only 2.5 stands. On May 19, 2012, Rot- Weiss Essen played their last match in the stadium against Fortuna K√∂ln. Two days later the Georg Melches Stadion was demolished and in August 2012 the Stadion Essen was opened.

Fralinger (October 22, 1848 in Sweetwater, New Jersey ‚Äì May 13, 1927 in Atlantic City, New Jersey) was an American businessman and confectioner, known for being the most successful merchandiser of salt water taffy. The confectionary store he founded in the late 19th century in Atlantic City remains a fixture on its famous boardwalk. Fralinger was a glassblower and fish merchant before he opened a retail store on the Atlantic City boardwalk to sell his taffy. Within a year, Fralinger had added a taffy concession and spent the winter perfecting the salt water taffy formula, first using molasses, then chocolate and vanilla, eventually creating 25 flavors. Life Fralinger shop at Boardwalk and Tennessee Ave. in Atlantic City. Fralinger was born in the Pleasant Mills of Sweetwater, Atlantic County, New Jersey. Raised by an uncle, his only legacy was the local area's major industry, glass blowing, which he had learned from his father. He worked that trade in Winslow, Waterford, and Philadelphia for sixteen years until strikes and disputes drove him to seek other employment. He moved to Philadelphia and worked in the fish and produce markets near 8th street. It was here that he met Nettie B. Beck. They married on June 9, 1870. He prospered there and the 1875 Philadelphia Directory listed, \\"Jos. Fralingers, Oysters\\" with his business at 900 E. Tulip Street and his home at Sargent near Tulip. In his free time he became active in baseball and played on teams with then-notables as Al Reach. His interest in baseball was strong enough to entice him to manage the Quaker City Base Ball Club and then his own ball club at Philadelphia's Jumbo Park. This team won 84 out of 96 games. Illness of his wife led him to Atlantic City as it was a popular prescription for many illnesses of the late 19th century. He formed and managed a minor league baseball team he named the August Flowers. The team played on a field he leased at New Jersey and Baltic Avenues. At summer's end, he accepted management of the former Wilmington Club. This venture was so unsuccessful that he was forced to sell all of his property and was left virtually penniless. Having formed a fascination for Atlantic City, he returned and accepted a job with bricklayer Edward S. Lee. His job was a hod carrier which was the bottom of the building trade's ladder. It is now approximately 1880 and the Ritchie Brothers and Windle W. Hollis had set up stands on the Atlantic City Boardwalk to sell taffy, the candy sensation of the day. The year 1884 found Joseph Fralinger in better financial position and he opened a cigar store at 724 Atlantic Avenue. He leased space for a soft drink stand from Captain John L. Young and Stewart McShea near New York Avenue. Fralinger carried the first baskets of apples from the Florida Avenue Draw Bridge at the Thoroughfare as fresh fruit for his stand. In addition to the apples he offered cider and mineral water and a 'NEW', cool and refreshing drink to the resort traveler, lemonade, which was to become 'the national drink'. He often attracted visitors to his stand by juggling lemons. At the end of the Summer of 1884, Captain John L. Young approached Fralinger to take over the taffy stand on the Applegate Pier. Fralinger agreed and in the Winter of 1885, he obtained books on confections. That next spring he made his first batch of Salt Water Taffy. He started with a molasses flavor, but quickly added the traditional favorites of Chocolate and Vanilla. As time went on more were added until the largest selection offered 25 different flavors. As Fralinger became accustomed to the Salt Water Taffy business, he came on the idea of a 'box' of Salt Water Taffy. He obtained 200 boxes for the first weekend of his new idea and to his amazement the one-pounders were sold out by Sunday noon. He immediately ran to a nearby seafood restaurant and finished the day's sales with oyster boxes. The one pound box of taffy became and still is the most popular size. It is \\"The Atlantic City Souvenir\\". The year 1889 saw the first mention of Salt Water Taffy in the Atlantic City Directory, \\"Hollis Windle W., Original Salt Water Taffy, Boardwalk near Arkansas Avenue.\\" Salt Water Taffy was not again listed until the 1899 Atlantic City Directory, when forty-two 'Confectioners' were listed. Only John Cassidy and Joseph Fralinger are associated with Salt Water Taffy from the names shown. The city was growing rapidly and Salt Water Taffy was becoming a household word. While Fralinger's idea of boxing taffy earned him the title \\"King of Salt Water Taffy\\", it did not discourage his further enterprises. His friendship with John L. Young and Stewart McShea led to numerous real estate ventures including the Toboggan Slide at Ocean Avenue. At New York Avenue he built the Fralinger Pharmacy, a Fralinger Candy Store, and the first, real Boardwalk theater, The Academy of Music. The New York Avenue apartments were named the Jeanette Apartments, after his wife. Later, they were known as the Fralinger Apartments. Fralinger spearheaded the drive in 1896 along with Young, McShea, and numerous Boardwalk land owners to increase the Boardwalk's width to sixty feet on a new steel foundation. He also fought to keep the railroads from laying tracks on the Ocean side of the Boardwalk. Through his real estate interests, he helped to build Chalfont and Westminister Avenues. Fralinger was a member of the volunteer Neptune Hose Company. Their headquarters were located at Connecticut and Atlantic Avenues. Established in 1882, they remained in force until 1904. Fralinger maintained a summer residence in Schwenksville, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. It was located high atop Spring Mountain overlooking the picturesque Perkiomen Valley. It was here that he became interested in a boys camp that was in need of repair. He purchased of land along the river and donated it to the Boy Scouts for use as a summer camp. Named Camp Fralinger in his honor, it was well used, especially by Boy Scouts from the Atlantic City area. During his later years, he also maintained a home in Miami, Florida. Joseph F. Fralinger, at 78 years old, died on May 13, 1927 and was laid to rest at the Atlantic City Cemetery on the mainland. References External links *James and Fralinger's Candy Co.

Dictionary of Eye Terminology. Gainesville, Florida: Triad Publishing Company, 1990. It consists of: * The lacrimal gland, which secretes the tears, and its excretory ducts, which convey the fluid to the surface of the human eye; it is a serous gland located in lacrimal fossa. It is a j-shaped gland; * The lacrimal canaliculi, the lacrimal sac, and the nasolacrimal duct, by which the fluid is conveyed into the cavity of the nose, emptying anterioinferiorly to the inferior nasal conchae from the nasolacrimal duct; * The innervation of the lacrimal apparatus involves both the a sympathetic supply through the carotid plexus of nerves around the internal carotid artery, and parasympathetically from the lacrimal nucleus of the facial nerve. The blood supply to the lacrimal gland is provided by the ophthalmic artery with its branch - the lacrimal artery, while the venous blood is drained from this region via the superior ophthalmic vein. The lacrimal system is made up of a secretory system, which produces tears, and an excretory system, which drains the tears. The lacrimal gland is primarily responsible for producing emotional or reflexive tears. As tears are produced, some fluid evaporates between blinks, and some is drained through the lacrimal punctum. The tears that are drained through the punctum will eventually be drained through the nose. Any excess fluid that did not go into the punctum will fall over the eyelid, which produces tears that are cried.

It is located at Garrison Petawawa, and is part of 2 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group. 2 CER was redesignated from 1 Field Engineer Squadron in 1977. It currently consists of 23 Field Squadron, 24 Field Squadron, 25 Support Squadron, 26 CIED Squadron and 28 Administration Squadron. Unit phrases - \\"Sea of Blue\\"  Unit history  In 1903, following the Boer War, the Royal Canadian Engineers were founded as the basis for the permanent military engineers and the Canadian Engineer Corps was created as a militia unit. One of the first tasks given to the Canadian engineers after the declaration of World War I was the construction of the Valcartier training site in Quebec. At its peak, 30,000 men were stationed there before the 1st Canadian Division was deployed. When the 1st Canadian Division arrived in Belgium, they were accompanied by the Canadian Engineer Corps. These troops were responsible for the construction of defences, sanitation systems, water supplies, bridging, and assisting with trench raids. The engineers, known as Sappers, were also tasked with digging tunnels underneath enemy trenches and planting explosives to destroy the trenches. These tunnels were strategic in winning the Battle of Vimy Ridge. Canadian engineers spent the early phases of World War II building camps and bases, both in Canada and abroad. Eventually, they received assault training and participated in field exercises so as to join infantry divisions as they worked through occupied Europe. The majority of their work consisted of constructing bailey bridges, clearing mines and booby traps and building communication networks and field defences in Northwestern Europe and throughout Italy. After the Canadian Forces unified in 1968, the Royal Canadian Engineers, Royal Canadian Navy Civil Engineers and the Royal Canadian Air Force Construction Division were amalgamated. The new branch went under the name Royal Canadian Engineers until 1973 when they were renamed the Canadian Military Engineers. In 2017, 2 Combat Engineer Regiment celebrated its 40th anniversary; and at the same time, the 20th anniversary of the Neder Rijn Engineer Park. A reunion event was held 7‚Äì9 July 2017, which was attended by over 500 members of the CME family. 2 CER is part of this history of Canadian military engineers. It provides combat engineering support to 2 CMBG.

This forms part of the lacrimal apparatus that drains lacrimal fluid from the surface of the eye to the nasal cavity.  Structure  There is a single lacrimal canaliculus in each eyelid, a superior lacrimal canaliculus in the upper eyelid and an inferior lacrimal canaliculus in the lower eyelid. The canaliculi travel vertically and then turn medially to travel towards the lacrimal sac. At the bend, the canaliculus is dilated and called the ampulla. Usually, the superior and inferior lacrimal canaliculi join to form a common passage that enters the lateral wall of the lacrimal sac. = Superior lacrimal canaliculus = The superior lacrimal canaliculus is located in the upper eyelid. It first ascends, then bends medially towards the lacrimal sac. It drains lacrimal fluid from the superior lacrimal punctum. It is smaller and shorter than the inferior lacrimal canaliculus. = Inferior lacrimal canaliculus = The inferior lacrimal canaliculus is located in the lower eyelid. It first descends, then bends medially towards the lacrimal sac. It drains lacrimal fluid from the inferior lacrimal punctum.  Histology  The lacrimal canaliculi have a mucosa composed of a non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium on a basement membrane and a highly elastic lamina propria. Surrounding the mucosa are skeletal muscle fibres continuous with the orbicularis oculi which forms a sort of sphincter. This may facilitate the draining of lacrimal fluid during blinking. Clinical significance Canaliculitis is inflammation of the lacrimal canaliculus.

Anthony Lukas, published by Alfred A. Knopf in 1985, that examines race relations in Boston, Massachusetts through the prism of desegregation busing. It received the Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction, the National Book Award, \\"National Book Awards ‚Äì 1985\\". National Book Foundation. Retrieved 2012-02-20. and the National Book Critics Circle Award. The book traces the history of three families: the working-class African-American Twymons, the working-class Irish McGoffs and the middle-class Yankee Divers. It gives brief genealogical histories of each families, focusing on how the events they went through illuminated Boston history, before narrowing its focus to the racial tension of the 1960s and the 1970s. Through their stories, Common Ground focuses on racial and class conflicts in two Boston neighborhoods‚Äîthe working-class Irish-American enclave of Charlestown, and the uneasily integrated South End. Each family is directly involved in the busing crisis. The McGoffs are proud residents of Charlestown who see an attempt to change the dynamics of their school as an assault on their families. The Twymons have long endured sub-standard education and are hoping that busing will finally change this. Colin Diver, a Harvard Law School graduate and assistant to Mayor Kevin White, and his wife Joan Diver, director of The Hyams Foundation, move into the gentrifying South End, a block from one of the Twymon sisters, who lives with her children in the shoddily constructed Methunion Manor housing project. The Divers are in favor of busing, but the effects hit home when they learn that it may result in their own son being bused to a foreign neighborhood. After six years of combating racial and class tension and street violence, the Divers leave the city for suburban Newton. In addition to the family stories, Common Ground examines many of the issues related to busing, including the protest movements, the disaffection between the \\"two-toilet\\" Irish middle-class and their working-class brethren, the impact of busing on national politics, and the evolution of the city's newsmedia.  Criticism  Robert Dentler, a sociologist who helped Judge Garrity draft the busing plan, criticized Common Ground for \\"distorted, questionable legends\\" and a \\"docudramatic method of reporting\\" that \\"cloak[ed] the ignorance, fear, and hostility of the minority of citizens in the white enclaves of Boston who initiated racial violence in the robe of civic innocence.\\"Dentler, Robert. Boston School Desegregation: The Fallowness of Common Ground, Trotter Institute Review, Summer 1987 However, in a retrospective appreciation, LynNell Hancock of the Columbia Journalism Review wrote, \\"Anthony Lukas was a perfectionist in a world that is far from perfect.

Bartolom√© has a volcanic cone that is easy to climb and provides great views of the other islands. Bartolom√© is famous for its Pinnacle Rock, which is a distinctive characteristic of this island. It has two visitor sites. At the first one, one may swim and snorkel around Pinnacle Rock; the underwater world there is really impressive. Snorkelers are in the water with the penguins, marine turtles, white-tipped reef sharks, and other tropical fish. The bay is also an excellent place to go swimming. The twin bays are separated by a narrow isthmus. Gal√°pagos penguins are frequently seen, and a small cave behind Pinnacle Rock houses a breeding colony. Seasonally, Bartolom√© is the mating and nesting site for the green turtles. With herons, they make use of the gentler beaches. The Gal√°pagos lava cacti colonize the new lava fields.

This is a leading case on the Trade Descriptions Act 1968 section 24(1), where Tesco relied upon the defence of the ‚Äòact or omission of another person‚Äô i.e. their store manager, to show that they had taken all reasonable precautions and all due diligence. Facts Tesco was offering a discount on washing powder which was advertised on posters displayed in stores. Once they ran out of the lower priced product the stores began to replace it with the regularly priced stock. The manager failed to take the signs down and a customer was charged at the higher price. Tesco was charged under the Trade Descriptions Act 1968 for falsely advertising the price of washing powder. In its defence Tesco argued that the company had taken all reasonable precautions and all due diligence, and that the conduct of the manager could not attach liability to the corporation. Judgment The House of Lords accepted the defence and found that the manager was not a part of the \\"directing mind\\" of the corporation and therefore his conduct was not attributable to the corporation. The corporation had done all it could to enforce the rules regarding advertising. Lord Reid held that, in order for liability to attach to the actions of a person, it must be the case that \\"The person who acts is not speaking or acting for the company. He is acting as the company and his mind which directs his acts is the mind of the company. If it is a guilty mind then that guilt is the guilt of the company.\\" In the House of Lords Tesco was successful with their defence showing that, * a store manager was classed as ‚Äòanother person‚Äô, and, * a system of delegating responsibility to that person was performance of due diligence, not avoidance of it The store manager was not the directing mind and will of the company - the company had done all it could to avoid committing an offence and the offence was the fault of another person (an employee). The company was acquitted.

It is noted for the Stoodley Pike Monument at its summit, which dominates the moors of the upper Calder Valley and the market town of Todmorden. The monument is near the villages of Mankinholes and Lumbutts, West Yorkshire, and was designed in 1854 by local architect James Green, and completed in 1856 at the end of the Crimean War. Mid-distance A closer view of the monument The monument replaced an earlier structure, started in 1814 and commemorating the defeat of Napoleon and the surrender of Paris. It was completed in 1815, after the Battle of Waterloo (Napoleonic Wars), but collapsed in 1854 after an earlier lightning strike, and decades of weathering. Its replacement was therefore built slightly further from the edge of the hill. During repair work in 1889 a lightning conductor was added, and although the tower has since been struck by lightning on numerous occasions, no notable structural damage is evident. There is evidence to suggest that some sort of structure existed on the site even before the earlier structure was built. The monument is approximately south west of Hebden Bridge and approximately east of Todmorden town centre. The monument was Grade II listed in 1984. The inscription above the entrance is worn and covered with lichen but it is legible and reads: > A BEACON MONUMENT > ERECTED BY PUBLIC SUBSCRIPTION > COMMENCED IN 1814 TO COMMEMORATE > THE SURRENDER OF PARIS TO THE ALLIES > AND FINISHED AFTER THE BATTLE OF > WATERLOO WHEN PEACE WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1815. > BY A STRANGE COINCIDENCE > THE PIKE FELL ON THE DAY THE RUSSIAN > AMBASSADOR LEFT LONDON BEFORE THE > DECLARATION OF WAR WITH RUSSIA IN 1854. > WAS REBUILT WHEN PEACE WAS RESTORED IN > 1856 > RESTORED AND LIGHTNING CONDUCTOR FIXED > 1889  Access  The site is accessible by the Pennine Way and other well-defined public footpaths and the moor surrounding it is on access land. There is no vehicular or bicycle access to the monument, although it is reached by many mountain bikers who ride the technical trail following the Pennine Way. The Pike stands on Langfield Common, and is therefore the responsibility of Calderdale Council. Langfield Common is a true moor and an SSSI. Stoodley Pike Monument contains a spiral staircase of 39 steps, accessed from its north side. During repairs in 1889 a grille was added to the top step, allowing more light in, so that only 6 or 7 steps are in darkness. There are no windows. The entrance to the balcony, the highest point that can be reached, and some 40 feet above ground level, is on the west face. Being accessible by right-of-way footpaths and Access Land restrictions, the site serves primarily as a destination for hikers and fell-runners. It is close to Mankinholes Youth Hostel, The Shepherd‚Äôs Rest and the Top Brink pub. Just below it on the contour shelf at roughly 200 metres lies the Harvelin Park housing estate. From here walkers can enjoy an easy 30-minute walk to the Pike. Many fell races visit the Pike, primarily those organised by Todmorden Harriers including the Noonstone, Hebden Bridge, Shepherd's Skyline and the Stoodley Pike Fell race. Stoodley Pike Monument can be easily seen on the horizon, if standing in front of Beacon Hill, in Halifax, West Yorkshire. In recent years the entrance to the tower has been re-paved and a seat has been provided to the southwest of the monument.

It was the first track on their 1971 album Surf's Up. Composition The Beach Boys hired Jack Rieley as their manager in 1970. In order to make the band more relevant, Rieley suggested that the band write songs that were more political. \\"Don't Go Near the Water\\" is the first example of this. The song puts an ironic, ecological spin on the traditional Beach Boys beach- and surf- based songs: instead of enjoying surfing and other fun activities, this time the listener is advised to avoid the water for environmental reasons. Recording The song was recorded at the same session as \\"Long Promised Road\\" and \\"4th of July\\", both also recorded for the Surf's Up album. The lead vocals are by the song's composers, Love and Jardine. Brian Wilson contributed the dissonant piano part, according to Peter Ames Carlin's book Catch a Wave (Rodale, 2006), page 159. Releases The song was chosen to be the B-side of the \\"Surf's Up\\" single, released on November 8, 1971. It did not chart. Featured as an A-side in New Zealand, it peaked at #21 there. It was later released on November 2, 1981 as the B-side of the \\"Come Go with Me\\" single. The single charted at #18 in the US but never charted in the UK.

She is the only Concordia-class ship in the Carnival fleet and the sole ship of her namesake class, the Splendor class. Her other sister ships are part of the Costa Crociere fleet. The ship entered service on 2 July 2008 as the largest Carnival ship until debuted in September 2009. Carnival Splendor is widely known for the November 2010 incident in which a fire started in the engine room, shutting down all electrical power to the ship. The ship was originally designed and ordered for Costa Cruises but she was transferred to Carnival Cruise Lines during construction.  Christening  Carnival Splendors godmother is Myleene Klass, who on 10 July 2008 christened the vessel in Dover in a ceremony where she played Sailing on the piano, while a Royal Navy diver climbed up five decks on a rope, and broke the bottle of champagne on the bow by hand. Areas of operation Carnival Splendors inaugural season began on 2 July 2008 with a cruise from Genoa, Italy to Dover, England, followed by cruises to Northern European ports. On 3 November 2008 she transited to Fort Lauderdale, Florida. In January 2009, Carnival Splendor moved to Long Beach, California, a journey which took 49 days. The ship was too wide for the Panama Canal at the time, so it made the journey by sailing around Cape Horn. It was the first Carnival ship to have ever made this voyage. From Long Beach, she sailed year-round cruises to Mexico. In March 2009, Carnival Splendor was the host ship for Mayercraft Carrier 2, a four-day cruise from 27 to 31 March, from Los Angeles to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico hosted by musician John Mayer and featuring music and comedy shows.Mayercraft Carrier 2 to set sail with John Mayer, Guster, news.jamradio.org, 18 June 2008. Retrieved 18 June 2008. In February 2013, Carnival Splendor sailed again around South America, re- positioning to New York City to cruise to the Caribbean and Bermuda. In November 2014, Carnival Splendor was re-positioned to Florida to offer seasonal seven-day cruises to the Eastern and Western Caribbean. In March 2014, Carnival announced Carnival Splendor would sail seasonally out of Norfolk, Virginia before heading back to New York beginning in 2015. In October 2015, Carnival announced that Carnival Splendor would be re-positioned to China in 2018 offering year-round short cruises. However, Carnival subsequently announced in November 2016 that Carnival Splendor would instead relocate to Long Beach for the second time in January 2018, offering cruises to the Mexican Riviera. To move to Long Beach from the Caribbean, she sailed through the Panama Canal and became one of the largest ships to cross through the new locks. In February 2018, Carnival announced Carnival Splendor would sail to Australia in December 2019 to operate year-round out of Sydney. On 5 October 2019, the ship embarked on a 24-day Transpacific cruise to Singapore, where she was dry docked to undergo renovations before being homeported in Sydney. Stops along the voyage included Maui, Oahu, Guam, Kota Kinabalu, and Ho Chi Minh City. This was the longest voyage ever offered by Carnival, and was Carnival Splendors final voyage out of Long Beach. From 30 October to 24 November 2019, Carnival Splendor underwent renovations prior to sailing to her homeport in Sydney. Incidents and accidents =2010 fire= A U.S. Navy helicopter delivering supplies to Carnival Splendor On 8 November 2010, at approximately 06:00 Pacific Time, on the second day of a voyage from Long Beach to the Mexican Riviera, the ship experienced a catastrophic failure of the No. 5 diesel generator which started a fire in her aft engine room. The fire spread to the overhead electrical cable runs in the aft engine room. The fire in the cable runs caused extensive damage to the cabling and contributed to the ship losing all electrical power. According to Carnival president, Gerry Cahill, a \\"crankcase split, and that's what caused the fire\\", adding it was isolated to the aft generator room. The fire was extinguished by the afternoon, and no one was injured. Nearly 4,500 passengers and crew members were on board at the time. The crew was unable to restore power to the engines, and the ship was towed by tugboat to San Diego. Without power for air conditioning and refrigeration, passengers were fed rations delivered via U.S. Navy helicopters from the aircraft carrier . Splendor was escorted by, and received aid and security assistance from the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter . Carnival Splendor arrived in San Diego under tow around sunrise on 11 November, and docked around noon. Carnival promised to refund all passengers for ticket and travel expenses along with a voucher for a free cruise of equal value to their cruise on Carnival Splendor. The ship has three 12-cylinder W√§rtsil√§ 12V46C medium-speed diesel generating sets in the aft engine room and three in a forward engine room.Carnival Splendor perplexes engine room safety experts. AMEM Communication, December 2010. Each generator is connected to two switchboards. The failure of a single engine or generator should not normally cause a total power loss. Clark Dodge, former chief engineer for Washington State Ferries, said, \\"If things were designed properly, all the power shouldn't have gone out.\\" The investigation into the fire was carried out by the United States Coast Guard in conjunction with the Panamanian Maritime Authority. The report into the cause of the fire was released on 15 July 2013. =2012 armed robbery= On 23 February 2012, while in Puerto Vallarta port, Mexico, 22 passengers on the Carnival-organized \\"City and Jungle Tour\\" were robbed by an armed bandit. Passengers lost money, cameras, purses, passports, other documents and valuables. No shots were fired and everybody escaped without injuries. =2017 engine troubles= On 2 March 2017 while offshore of Puerto Rico the ship experienced engine trouble requiring operation on a single engine. Carnival canceled the remaining portion of the cruise and returned to Miami. Carnival offered a 50% refund off the cost of the cruise, free internet use for the remainder of the voyage, and a 50% discount off a future cruise.

Common Ground Health Clinic provides programs to address community health care needs through collaborative partnerships. The clinic started on September 9, 2005 just days after Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast. Common Ground Health Clinic had its beginnings when four young street medics showed up in Algiers a few days after the hurricane. They began riding around on bicycles asking residents if they needed medical attention. Locals were apparently surprised to be approached in this way, since no representatives of government agencies or of the Red Cross had appeared up to that point. The medics offered first aid, took blood pressure, tested for diabetes, and asked about symptoms of anxiety, depression, and other disease. The clinic was originally set up in a mosque, the Masjid Bilal. Nurses, physicians, herbalists, acupuncturists, EMTs, social workers and community activists came from around the world to volunteer at Common Ground Health Clinic. Current The clinic has filled part of the need left by the shuttering in the aftermath of the storm of Charity Hospital, a free public hospital that had served the citizens of New Orleans since 1736. To date, the clinic has recorded over 60,000 patient visits - all at no or low charge to the patient. Staff at the clinic also work in the community to address societal factors that contribute to ill health, such as systemic racism and poverty. Patient services include primary care, Spanish medical interpreting, mind-body medicine groups, herbal medicine, social work, acupuncture and testing for HIV. The clinic is now located in the space formerly occupied by a corner grocery store, at 1400 Teche Street in the Algiers neighborhood of New Orleans. The budget for 2010 was approximately $1.3 million. In 2013 the clinic received Federally Qualified Health Clinic status. Awards and recognition Dr. Ravi Vadlamudi, a Tulane University physician and first medical director after the storm, was recognized as one of the year's CNN Heroes for his efforts in opening the clinic in the aftermath of the storm. The clinic was awarded the highest marks by the National Committee for Quality Assurance for its community-based care efforts. The clinic has been featured in a number of national and international publications and television and radio shows.

Information  The school, which was founded in 1958, is located at the base of the San Gabriel Mountains, situated on of property leased from the California Department of Transportation. Sequoyah School has two campuses, and the student body has 375 students.  Campus  The K-8 campus was originally the site of an 1887 shingle-style church. In the 1950s, the architecture firm Smith and Williams designed two buildings on the site. They built a children's chapel (1954) and a Sunday- school building (1956). Garrett Eckbo designed the grounds. The children's chapel won an AIA Award of Merit in 1954. The Sequoyah School became a part- time tenant of the church in 1958. The original church was demolished in 1974 when Caltrans was planning to expand the 710 Freeway through the site, but the project remains unrealized due to community opposition. The Smith and Williams buildings remains to this day. In 2013, the campus was expanded by Los Angeles architecture firm, Fung + Blatt Architects. Weaving into the existing mid- century campus fabric, Sequoyah‚Äôs expansion echoes the spirit of the original architecture, while providing a sustainable, contemporary interpretation for a new generation. The expansion was published in Architectural Record and also won an honor award for design and a sustainability award by the AIA Pasadena & Foothills chapter The high school campus is located on the grounds of the Neighborhood Church in Pasadena, adjacent to the historic Gamble House and within walking distance of playing fields in the Arroyo and the Rose Bowl Aquatic Center. It is only a few miles away from the K-8 campus. Financial Aid  Sequoyah School maintains a financial assistance program that provides tuition support to approximately 30-40% of its student population, including its Yvonne Pinto Fund, dedicated to the students of employees of the school. The School is well known for its ethnic, racial, gender, cultural, and economic diversity. Governance The school is governed by a Board of Trustees.

It is a subordinate body of the AFL-CIO, and as of 2011 has about 320 affiliated member unions representing half a million union members in Cook County. The labor body is also involved in political lobbying, often in alliance with other allied organizations (e.g.,. Interfaith Worker Justice), is active in Chicago politics, and participates in many of Chicago's civic committees (composed of business and city leaders). Early years The CFL was formed by the American Federation of Labor (AFL) on November 9, 1896. In part, the federation was an outgrowth of previous umbrella labor bodies in the city, many of which had fragmented during the previous two decades. But, in part, the formation of the CFL was an attempt to end corruption in Chicago's labor unions. Only over time did the CFL change its focus to strengthening the efforts of individual union locals by creating a unified voice for the city's labor movement, uphold the labor rights of its union members, and mediate contract disputes on behalf of local unions. Unfortunately, the CFL was dominated in its early years by Martin \\"Skinney\\" Madden, a notoriously corrupt labor leader who had managed to get himself elected President, Vice President and Treasurer for life in his Steamfitters' local in Chicago.Segal, The Rise of the United Association: National Unionism in the Pipe Trades, 1884‚Äì1924, 1969; Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States. Vol. 3: The Policies and Practices of the American Federation of Labor, 1900‚Äì1909, 1964.Newton-Matza, \\"The Crack of the Whip: The Chicago Federation of Labor Battles Against the Labor Injunction in the 1920s,\\" Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society, Spring 2000.\\"Former Labor Czar of Chicago Succumbs at Lake Villa, Ill., to Long Sickness,\\" Chicago Daily News, July 22, 1912.Cohen, The Racketeer's Progress: Chicago and the Struggle for the Modern American Economy, 1900‚Äì1940, 2004. The early years of the CFL saw corrupt and reform elements battle for control. The CFL's constitution required an election for the presidency every six months, which encouraged instability, and a new president was elected roughly every year in the organization's first decade. Elections were also rife with fraud and violence. In January 1903, Madden arranged to have the names of all the reform candidates placed low on the ballot, many names were misspelled to deny the candidate election, and some names omitted altogether. Unions on both sides padded their membership lists in order to have more delegates to the convention. At least seven major brawls broke out on the convention floor, and one man was injured so badly he had to be rushed to the hospital. Only police intervention brought order.\\"Fraud Charge By Labor,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, January 18, 1903.\\"Slug At Labor Election,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, January 19, 1903. The July 1904 election saw such widespread violence (including fistfights in front of the ballot boxes). Three brawlers had to be carried home.\\"'Slug' At Labor Election,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, July 18, 1904. Reform elements began to get the upper hand in 1905. Charles Dold was elected in January of that year despite ballot irregularities, accusations of bribery, and ballot box stuffing. When Dold appeared to have enough support to win re- election on July 16, 1905, Madden's supporters attempted to prevent his victory by smashing ballot boxes and destroying ballots. Madden's thugs severely beat Michael Donnelly, a Dold supporter and international president of the Amalgamated Butcher Workmen, on the floor of the convention in full view of hundreds of delegates.The beating contributed to Donnelly's alcoholism and triggered increasingly severe mental disorders. Donnelly disappeared in 1916, and presumably died a short time later. He was never heard from again, despite a nationwide search by the union he once led. See: Fink, Biographical Dictionary of American Labor, 1984. Madden disrupted the election so much that a new election was held on August 6. Again, Madden used violence and fraud to force cancellation of the election. Dold finally won re-election on August 13. Madden's forces boycotted the August 13 election and claimed the results were invalid. He pressured the CFL into invalidating the election on August 20, but public outcry and an investigation by the AFL led the CFL to reverse itself on September 3.Gompers, The Samuel Gompers Papers, Vol. 6: The American Federation of Labor and the Rise of Progressivism, 1902-6, 1997. John Fitzpatrick was elected CFL president on January 21, 1906. Despite repeated attempts to deny reform delegates seats at subsequent conventions and install his own puppet as CFL president, Dold and Fitzpatrick branded Madden a dual unionist for being under the control of organized crime. They campaigned actively against him and his most powerful supporter throughout the fall and winter. More than 150 policemen were on guard in the convention hall on January 21 to ensure that there was no repeat of the violence of 1905. Fitzpatrick easily outpolled his opponent, two to one.\\"Seeks to Control Labor,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, October 12, 1905; \\"Plan to Oust 'Skinny',\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, October 26, 1905; \\"Votes Will Test Madden's Power,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, January 21, 1906.\\"Labor Routs Madden 'Gang',\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, January 22, 1906. Fitzpatrick regime Fitzpatrick's election ushered in an era of stability and reform for the labor federation. The CFL gained increasing amounts of autonomy, and became one of the nation's leading central labor federations. For a while, William Z. Foster and his circle, briefly organized as the International Trade Union Educational League became influential.Foster, William Z. From Bryan to Stalin New York; International Publishers pp. 82‚Äì85 In the 1910s and during World War I, Fitzpatrick oversaw mass organizing drives in steel and meatpacking, led by Foster. The CFL also affiliated the Chicago Federation of Teachers, providing critical support for the nascent teachers' union movement. After World War I, the CFL was active in the formation of the short-lived Labor Party of the United States. Fitzpatrick endorsed socialism and remained a political progressive for the rest of his life, although he also fought bitterly to keep communists out of the labor movement.Lazerson, \\"Teachers Organize: What Margaret Haley Lost,\\" History of Education Quarterly, Summer 1984; Barrett, \\"Boring From Within and Without: William Z. Foster, the Trade Union Educational League, and American Communism in the 1920s,\\" in Labor Histories: Class, Politics, and the Working-Class Experience, 1998; Barrett, Work and Community in the Jungle: Chicago's Packinghouse Workers, 1984‚Äì1922, 1987; Cohen, Making a New Deal: Industrial Workers in Chicago, 1919‚Äì1939, 1990; McKillen, Chicago Labor and the Quest for a Democratic Diplomacy, 1914‚Äì1924, 1995; Newell, Chicago and the Labor Movement: Metropolitan Unionism in the 1930s, 1961.Pelling, \\"Labour and Politics in Chicago,\\" Political Studies, February 1957. Fitzpatrick's presidency was also notable for its emphasis on ending the corruption that plagued the CFL during the Madden era. He worked closely with fellow reformer Illinois State Federation of Labor President Reuben Soderstrom to combat the influence of organized crime on organized labor.Soderstrom, Carl; Soderstrom, Robert; Stevens, Chris; Burt, Andrew (2018). Forty Gavels: The Life of Reuben Soderstrom and the Illinois AFL-CIO. 2. Peoria, IL: CWS Publishing. pp. 32, 53-54. . Fitzpatrick also worked to counter perceived press bias against labor. From 1926 through 1979, the Chicago Federation of Labor operated a radio station, WCFL, as the \\"Voice of Labor\\" in the Midwest.Godfried, WCFL: Chicago's Voice of Labor, 1926‚Äì78, 1997. Post-WWII era Fitzpatrick died in office in September 1946 at the age of 75. His successor was William A. Lee, a vice president of the Teamsters. Lee expanded CFL's role in the politics. Although personally a conservative, Lee continued to support a broad liberal agenda. Lee was a close friend to Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley, and a very strong backer of the Cook County Democratic Party.MacArthur, The Selling of \\"Free Trade\\": NAFTA, Washington, and the Subversion of American Democracy, 2001.Ralph, Northern Protest: Martin Luther King, Jr., Chicago, and the Civil Rights Movement, 1993. Although the AFL and the Congress of Industrial Organizations merged in 1955, the respective Chicago bodies did not do so until 1962. Lee was elected president of the unified organization, and remained so until his death in 1984.Bliss, \\"City AFL-CIO Units Merge in Ceremony,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, January 9, 1962; \\"William Lee, Labor Leader, Dies at Age 89,\\" Chicago Tribune, June 17, 1984. Since Lee's death, there have been six presidents of the Chicago Federation of Labor, about one every five years. Twice (Robert Healey and Don Turner) the presidency has gone to a member from the Chicago Federation of Teachers, giving the teachers union a top spokesperson in the labor federation for 14 of the last 23 years. Healey was the first president since Charles Dold in 1905 to retire from the presidency rather than die in office. Under Healey, the CFL began to distance itself from its close relationship with the Democratic Party to take a more independent stance on issues. Under Turner, the CFL emphasized community investment, workforce development, affordable living, and an end to urban sprawl.Mendieta, \\"Labor Leader Robert Healey Dies at 72,\\" Chicago Sun-Times, July 24, 2002; \\"A Labor Leader's Passing,\\" Substance, September 2002; LeRoy, \\"Smart Growth for Cities: It's a Union Thing,\\" WorkingUSA, June 2002; Fitzgerald, Moving Up in the New Economy: Career Ladders for U.S. Workers, 2006. In 2010, CFL delegates elected Jorge Ramirez (UFCW Local 1546) the first Mexican-American president of the organization. Ramirez's tenure was marked by a boom in construction and tourism, as well as an attack on public sector unions by right-leaning organizations. In 2018, Robert G. (\\"Bob\\") Reiter, Jr. was elected president after serving 8 years as the CFL's Secretary-Treasurer. Reiter, a member of Operating Engineers Local 150 and an attorney, is considered a progressive in the labor movement.

Instead of voting only for a single candidate, voters in IRV elections can rank the candidates in order of preference. Ballots are initially counted for each elector's top choice, losing candidates are eliminated, and ballots for losing candidates are redistributed until one candidate is the top remaining choice of a majority of the voters. When the field is reduced to two, it has become an \\"instant runoff\\" that allows a comparison of the top two candidates head-to-head. IRV more commonly known outside the US as the alternative vote or preferential voting, was devised around 1870 by the US architect W. R. Ware. Today it is in use at a national level to elect the Australian House of Representatives, the National Parliament of Papua New Guinea, the President of Ireland and President of India. In Australia it is also used for elections to the legislative assemblies (lower houses) of all states and territories except Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory, and for the Tasmanian Legislative Council (upper house). IRV is also used a number of municipal elections in Australia, the United States, United Kingdom and New Zealand. Because of its relationship to the Single Transferable Vote (STV) system, IRV is used for by-elections and elections with only a single winner (such as elections for the President of Ireland) in some jurisdictions that use STV for ordinary parliamentary elections, such as the Republic of Ireland and Scotland. IRV is known by different names in the various countries in which it is used. It is also known as the 'Alternative Vote', 'Ranked Choice Voting', and 'Preferential Voting', although IRV is only one of a number of forms of preferential voting systems.  History  This method was considered by Condorcet as early as 1788, though only to condemn it, for its ability to eliminate a candidate preferred by a majority of voters. Instant-runoff voting is based on the Single Transferable Vote electoral system, developed by Hill in 1819, Hare in 1857, and Andrae in 1855. Unlike IRV, the Single Transferable Vote was designed as a form of proportional representation involving multi-seat constituencies, and today STV is used in a number of countries, including Australia, the Republic of Ireland and Malta. It is also known as Ware's method, after William Robert Ware, the founder of the schools of architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Columbia University, who, while describing the Single Transferable Vote system in 1871, mentioned that it could also be used for single-winner elections. IRV was adopted for the Australian House of Representatives in 1918 and has been used to elect the President of Ireland since the office came into being in 1937. It was introduced in Fiji in 1999 and in Papua New Guinea in 2007. Use by country =Australia= IRV (in Australia called preferential voting) was introduced for House of Representatives elections in Australia after the Swan by-election in October 1918, when the conservative Country Party, representing small farmers, split the non-Labor vote in conservative country areas, allowing Labor candidates to win on a first-past-the-post vote then in place. The conservative Nationalist government of Billy Hughes introduced preferential voting to enable the Coalition parties to field candidates in the same electorates without putting Coalition seats at risk. It was first used at the Corangamite by-election on 14 December 1918, and nationwide at the 1919 election. Preferential voting continued to benefit the Coalition until the 1990 election, when for the first time the Labor Bob Hawke government obtained a net benefit from preferential voting. Ballot papers are marked with the order of preferences: 1, 2, 3, etc. Counting of the ballot papers proceeds and when no candidate receives 50% plus one vote of the first preference vote (candidates with a number one), the candidate with the fewest first preference votes is eliminated and that candidate's votes are distributed to the remaining candidates. The process continues until a candidate accumulates 50% plus one vote, or a simple majority. Counting will continue to finality, which results in what is referred to as the two-party preferred vote, which expresses the electorate's voting preference equivalent to a 2-person election of the two most popular candidates. Most council (local government) elections also use the method, as do the lower house elections of four states (New South Wales, South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia), the sole house of one state (Queensland) and one territory (the Northern Territory) and the upper house of one other state (Tasmania). A study of the 2007 federal election found that every House of Representatives electorate had at least four candidates, and the average number of candidates was seven. 76 candidates depended on preferences to win, which represented more than half of the 150 winners. Preferential voting is used for most state and local elections in Australia, but sometimes with optional preferential voting where voters are allowed to limit their number of rankings. The Australian Senate, the upper houses of four states (New South Wales, South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia), the lower house of one state (Tasmania) and the sole house of the Australian Capital Territory, use the single transferable vote. = Canada = Under the name 'preferential' or 'elimination ballot' or alternative vote, IRV was used in the British Columbia's general elections of 1952 and 1953. IRV was initially brought in by the governing coalition consisting of the Liberal and Conservative parties. In the next election many CCF supporters chose the relatively unknown Social Credit Party, a minor party that had never held any seats in the British Columbia legislature, as their second choice. The Social Credit Party achieved an upset victory in the 1952 election, winning 19 seats in the 48-member legislature to 18 for the CCF, 6 for the Liberals and 4 for the Conservatives. The Socreds formed a short-lived minority government until the 1953 election, in which they won a majority of seats (28 of 48). After the 1953 election, the Liberal and renamed Progressive Conservative Parties were reduced to third parties in the province, and first-past-the-post was reinstated by the government. It has never been used for federal elections but was also used for provincial elections in Alberta (1926‚Äì1955 in rural districts), and Manitoba (1927‚Äì1953). IRV is used for certain party and private elections in Canada, including such large-scale elections at the Canadian Wheat Board,2006 CWB Election of Directors the 2006 Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta leadership election, where it has generated high turnout, and the 2011 British Columbia Liberal Party leadership election. The Liberal Party of Canada had adopted IRV with a national primary for its leadership elections. In 2014, the Province of Ontario announced that municipalities would have the option to use IRV for local elections starting in 2018, and authorizing legislation was passed in 2016. London, Ontario became the first city to use ranked choice voting in 2018, and Cambridge and Kingston will join in 2022. Instant-runoff voting is used in whole or in part to elect the leaders of the three largest federal political parties in Canada: the Liberal Party of Canada, the Conservative Party of Canada, and the New Democratic Party, albeit the New Democratic Party uses a mixture of IRV and exhaustive voting, allowing each member to choose one format or the other for their vote (as was used in their 2017 leadership election). In 2013, members of the Liberal Party of Canada elected Justin Trudeau as party leader through IRV in a national leadership election. The Conservative Party used IRV (where each of the party's 338 riding associations are weighted equally, regardless of how many members voted in each riding) to elect Erin O'Toole as party leader in 2020, and Stephen Harper in 2004. = Czech Republic = IRV is used to elect leaders of the Green party. =Hong Kong= IRV is used to elect a small number of functional constituencies of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong, all of which have very small electorates. =India = IRV is used in numerous electoral college environments, including the election of the President of India by the members of the Parliament of India and of the Vidhan Sabhas ‚Äì the state legislatures. The election is held with IRV, which in the Indian Constitution (Article 55) is called single transferable vote. =Ireland= All public elections in the Republic of Ireland are described as using the single transferable vote, or \\"proportional representation by the means of the single transferable vote\\". In the case of single-winner elections STV reduces to IRV, although neither \\"instant runoff voting\\" nor \\"alternative vote\\" is a commonly used name in Ireland. All constituencies for D√°il, Seanad, MEP, and local elections are multi-member (STV). Single-winner (IRV) elections include: all presidential elections; single-vacancy D√°il by-elections; all Seanad by- elections; replacing and three of the seven √ödar√°s na Gaeltachta constituencies (1999‚Äì2012). The D√°il elects a Taoiseach (prime minister) by majority motion, but since 2016 elects its Ceann Comhairle (speaker) by IRV ballot. Local authorities elect their (chairperson) by exhaustive ballot, \\"non-instant\\" runoff voting. The Local Government Act 2019 provides for steps towards introducing directly elected mayors; the government's detailed proposal document implies IRV would be used to elect them. Referendums in Ireland currently require a binary yes/no question; in 2018 the Citizens' Assembly recommended allowing multiple-choice referendums with the result determined via IRV. While most elections in the Republic of Ireland use the single transferable vote (STV), in single-winner contests this reduces to IRV. This is the case in all Presidential elections and Seanad panel by- elections,Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Act, 1947 ¬ß58: Provision applicable where more than one casual vacancy. Irish Statute Book and most D√°il by- elections In the rare event of multiple simultaneous vacancies in a single D√°il constituency, a single STV by-election may be held;Electoral Act, 1992 ¬ß39(3) Irish Statute Book for Seanad panels, multiple IRV by-elections are held. =New Zealand= The single transferable vote (STV), a multi-seat variation of IRV, is used for all district health board elections. Starting in 2004, several New Zealand cities and local authorities began to use STV for their elections‚Äîincluding the nation's second largest city and capital Wellington and its fifth largest city Dunedin Where electing a mayor directly, these cities used instant runoff voting. In 2007, for example, Wellington's mayor Kerry Prendergast defeated her 10 rivals on the 9th round of counting. Other contested IRV races have included the 2010 Dunedin mayoral election and 2010 Wellington City mayoral election. In the 1992 referendum on the voting method to elect members of the New Zealand House of Representatives, the alternative vote was one of the four alternative methods available (alongside MMP, STV and SM). It came third of the alternative methods (ahead of SM) with 6.6% of the vote. IRV, under the name preferential vote, was one of the four alternative methods choices presented in the 2011 voting method referendum, but the referendum resulted in New Zealanders choosing to keep their proportional method of representation instead, while IRV came last with 8.34%. As of September 2013, seven authorities are elected with STV: Dunedin City Council, Greater Wellington Council, Kapiti Coast District Council, Marlborough District Council, Palmerston North City Council, Porirua City Council, and Wellington City Council. Wellington upheld STV in a 2008 ballot measure. Multi-member wards in these cities use STV. The New Zealand Labour Party in 2013 was using IRV to pick a new party leader. IRV (again under the name preferential vote) was used on the initial ballot of the 2015‚Äì2016 New Zealand flag referendums for voters to rank their preferences about the five new flag options. =Papua New Guinea= A form of IRV has been used to elect members of parliament since last plurality voting election in 2002. Called \\"limited preferential voting\\" because voters are limited to ranking three candidates, the system has been credited with reducing election violence in a highly fractured political system. IRV has been used since 2003 for the national parliament election, where voters are limited to ranking three candidates. =United Kingdom= IRV is currently used in the United Kingdom for by-elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly and to local assemblies in Scotland, both of which use the single transferable vote method of proportional representation in regularly scheduled elections. It is used in its contingent vote form (also called the supplementary vote), for all direct elections for mayor in England, including in London. It is used to fill vacancies within the House of Lords, to elect the leaders of the Liberal Democrats and the Labour Party and for many private elections, including for Chancellor of Oxford University and rectorial elections at the University of Edinburgh.The University of Edinburgh - Rectorial Election IRV was the electoral method available to select a replacement MEP by election for the Northern Ireland constituency of the European parliament, however now a party can co-opt a replacement without the need for a by-election.System for replacing MEPs changed BBC Northern Ireland IRV has been debated vigorously in the country since the early 20th century. In 1917, for example, the Speaker's Conference advocated the adoption of IRV for 358 of the 569 constituencies in the UK, and STV for the rest; its intention was that STV would be used in densely populated urban areas but, in order to keep constituencies from being too large, IRV would be used in more sparsely populated rural areas. Although the House of Commons voted in favour of the proposals five times, the House of Lords rejected it until the nationwide effort was ultimately abandoned in parliament. In 1921 the Government of Ireland Act established two home rule parliaments in Ireland‚Äìthe Parliament of Northern Ireland and the Parliament of Southern Ireland‚Äìand while STV was used for regular elections to these bodies, IRV was used for by-elections. This combination of IRV and STV has been used in what is now the Republic of Ireland ever since. The Northern Ireland Parliament continued to use the combination until the late 1920s when it switched to the 'first past the post' plurality system. However, STV for regular elections, and IRV for by-elections, has been reintroduced and used there to elect devolved assemblies since the 1970s. IRV is usually referred to in the UK as the 'Alternative Vote' or 'AV'. In 1998 the Jenkins Commission, charged by the government with suggesting an alternative system to plurality, devised a new system called the Alternative Vote Plus (AV+) for elections to the British Parliament. This involved a combination of party-list proportional representation and single seat constituencies elected under IRV. However no action has been taken on the Commission's report. In March 2009 the government announced that it would run an inquiry into the use of IRV at future general elections, and in February 2010 the House of Commons voted to hold a national referendum on AV. The government's term expired before this legislation was approved, but in July 2010, newly elected Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg announced a referendum on AV, subsequently held on 5 May 2011. The proposal would have affected the way in which Members of Parliament are elected to the British House of Commons at Westminster. It was only the second national referendum ever to be held within the United Kingdom and the result of the referendum was a decisive rejection of the adoption of the alternative vote by a margin of 67.9% to 32.1% of voters on a national turnout of 42%.The Electoral Commission Referendum result =United States= Since 1912, IRV has been adopted and repealed in various United States jurisdictions. Between 1912 and 1930, limited forms of RCV (typically with only two rankings) were implemented and subsequently repealed in Florida, Indiana, Maryland, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. Since 2002, IRV has been adopted by more than a dozen cities, with some adoptions pending implementation. Jurisdictions that have implemented and then repealed IRV include Ann Arbor, Michigan (1974‚Äì1976); Pierce County, Washington (2006‚Äì2009); Burlington, Vermont (2005‚Äì2010); Aspen, Colorado (2007‚Äì2010); and in North Carolina (2006‚Äì2013). As of September 2013, American cities currently using IRV to elect at least one office include Minneapolis, Minnesota; Oakland, California; St. Paul, Minnesota; San Francisco, California; Takoma Park, Maryland; Berkeley, California; San Leandro, California; and Telluride, Colorado. San Francisco's system of IRV was challenged in federal court, but a unanimous panel of the US Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit upheld San Francisco's IRV law, finding that the plaintiff failed to establish that the City's chosen electoral system was unconstitutional.Dudum v. Arntz, 640 F.3d 1098 (9th Cir. 2011) Private organizations in the U.S. that use IRV include the Hugo Awards for science fiction, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in selection of the Oscar for Best Picture, and more than fifty colleges and universities for student elections.instantrunoff.com Maine became the first U.S. state to approve IRV for its primary and general elections for governor, U.S. Senate, U.S. House and state legislature in a 2016 referendum. The state supreme court ruled this method of voting was unconstitutional for state general elections, but this ruling did not affect primary and federal elections. The state legislature attempted to repeal IRV for all elections unless the state constitution was amended, but this repeal was put on hold by a people's veto petition. The June 2018 primary election both used IRV to determine party candidates and Maine Question 1 passed, which blocked the repeal. Democrat Jared Golden became the first congressional candidate in the United States to win a general election as a result of IRV, defeating incumbent Republican Bruce Poliquin in second round balloting for Maine's 2nd congressional district in 2018. In the future, IRV will also be used for primary elections for federal elections and only primary elections for state offices. A bill passed in August 2019 will make Maine the first state to use IRV in presidential general elections in 2020, but use in presidential primaries has been delayed until 2024. Six states planned to use RCV in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries: Alaska, Hawaii, Kansas, and Wyoming for all voters; Iowa and Nevada for absentee voters. Rather than eliminating candidates until a single winner is chosen, voters' choices would be reallocated until all remaining candidates have at least 15%, the threshold to receive delegates to the convention.

It is a Local Nature Reserve and a Site of Metropolitan Importance for Nature Conservation. The name of the site is a testament to the engineering overspill when Millwall Dock was being constructed in the 1860s. Spoil from the excavation of the Dock, and silt from its channels and waterways were dumped on nearby land, using a conveyor system. Facilities The Mudchute Association, is a registered charity whose primary objective is \\"Management of the park and farm with special consideration for animals, wildlife, visitors, trainees & staff. To maintain the financial sustainability of the project and to respond to local needs and initiatives.\\" The park now covers , and the local authority describes the farm as the largest urban farm in Europe. Mudchute DLR station, named after the park, opened in 1987. However, the nearest train station for the park is Crossharbour. History The Millwall Freehold Land and Dock Company owned a huge swathe of land across the Isle of Dogs as it intended to extend the docks to meet the Thames in the east one day, when there was enough business to justify it. Until then, the company kept the land undeveloped, mostly leasing it out for pasture. This was also the case of the later Mudchute (or 'Mud Shoot' as it was originally spelled in official documents). The name \\"Mudchute\\" derives from it being the former dumping ground for mud dredged from the Millwall Docks, which had to be regularly dredged to prevent silting up. A novel, pneumatic device was employed which pumped the liquefied mud through a pipe over East Ferry Rd (close to the George pub), dumping it on the other side. This system was designed by dock engineer Frederic Eliot Duckham (father of Alexander Duckham who later founded his eponymous lubricating oil company in Millwall). The mud stank terribly, and Poplar Borough Council continually complained to the dock company that it was causing disease (including diphtheria) among locals, attempting unsuccessfully to have the mud dumping stopped. (Later Mudchute allotment holders who built wells to provide water to their plants complained at its condition, but it was some decades before the council pumped clean water to the Mudchute allotments.) By 1890, the Millwall Dock Company had not yet dumped mud on the northern edge of its land east of East Ferry Rd, which meant the ground was flat and solid. Landlord of the nearby George pub, William Clark, leased a 400 ft by 420 ft plot on the flat land, planning to develop an athletics stadium for football, cricket and tennis, with running and cycling tracks. The stadium was opened in June 1890 and became the home of Millwall Athletic football team. An Asda supermarket was later built on the site. The smell remained, though, as Corinthians player and England International Fred Pelly later declaring that he did not mind playing on the ground, but he objected falling down on it because \\"the smell wouldn't come off for weeks\\". In 1901, the dock company decided that it wanted its land back, in order to use it for timber storage. It had plans to install a large timber transporter, which would carry off-loaded timber from the docks to warehouses on the ground where the stadium was located, which would become known as the Transporter Yard. Millwall Athletic football club was forced to find its fourth ground on the Island (they moved to an area of land that would later be known as Millwall Park). 3.7\\" Ack Ack gun on display at the farm During World War II the Transporter Yard served as an RAF embarkation point, and a section of the higher land was the site for four Ack Ack Anti-aircraft guns. The 154 Battery of the 52 Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery was stationed at the Mudchute until 26 March 1941. Then the 119 Heavy Anti- Aircraft Regiment manned the site until 1945. The guns were fired by remote control using Radar to track the enemy aeroplanes. The Blitz started on 7 September 1940, and on 8 September the Guardroom, canteen and stores was destroyed by landmines, but there were no casualties. During the Blitz 430 people were killed on the Isle of Dogs.Island History Trust, information panels, Mudchute, 17 March 2013 After the war, the Mudchute remained owned by the Port of London Authority (PLA), and was patrolled by PLA Police, but it was used for diverse purposes: a PLA Sports Club football pitch near the Pier St entrance, a huge commercial cattle shed on the site of the later farm buildings, allotments and a large playground for all the children of the Isle communities. When, in the early 1970s, the PLA realized the Millwall Docks would close in the foreseeable future, they negotiated with the GLC (Greater London Council) to transfer the Mudchute land to them for housing purposes. However, the Association of Island Communities launched a successful campaign to make sure the land became a public, open space. A newly formed Mudchute Association leased the land (except for that land leased to Asda for one of their supermarkets). from Tower Hamlets Borough Council, and a farm and garden was established in 1977.

It is a land-based spatial memory task in which a thirsty rat uses distal spatial cues to search an open field for a specific location (Oasis) containing water. The maze consists of an enclosed space (usually the same shape and dimensions of the space used in the Morris water maze) in which a small amount of water is hidden. A thirsty rat is then placed in the maze and learns where the water is by trial and error. The maze tests memory by allowing the researcher to record the rat's performance on this task after it is learned and various time intervals or other events supposedly disruptive to memory have occurred.  Apparatus  The Oasis maze is a circular, acrylic board (1.8 m in diameter) that is painted flat white and raised 76 cm from the floor by a table with a lazy Susan attached, allowing the board to be freely rotated about its central axis. The surface of the board contains 426 evenly spaced wells (2.5 cm in diameter, 1.3 cm in depth) in which small amounts of water (0.3 ml) can be hidden. Water is used as a reward because, unlike food rewards, rats cannot locate the water using olfactory cues.  Phase I: Pretraining  Rats are water deprived by removing their water for 23 h/day for 3 days. Next, water is randomly placed in half of the 426 wells on the Oasis maze platform (0.3 ml per well), and the rats are given 5 min to find and drink as much water as they can on 2 occasions, separated by 30 min. The next day this procedure is repeated with only 25% of the wells containing water. On the final day, only 5 of the wells contain water. Pretraining on this day ends when the rats locate and consume water from all 5 baited wells.  Phase II: Spatial training  Following pretraining, rats are given 8 trials a day for 10 days. On each trial, water is placed in a single well. For each rat, the water is always located in the same position relative to the testing room and distal spatial cues. Four different target well locations are used; 1 in the center of each quadrant, to control for any position biases the rats might have. The target well location to which each rat is assigned is counterbalanced within each experimental group. Local cues are made irrelevant (including odor trails) by rotating the entire apparatus a predetermined distance and direction after each trial. However, the water is always placed in the same location relative to the testing room and distal spatial cues. In addition to the groups trained to find water by using spatial cues, another group (RANDOM) is given an equivalent amount of training, except that the location of the water varies randomly from trial to trial and could appear in any of the 426 wells. Thus, this group could develop optimal strategies for finding the water efficiently, but memory of specific locations is irrelevant. The RANDOM group provides a measure of where rats with no spatial memory of a trained location will spend their search time during probe trials. The probe trials for this group are administered 14 days after the end of training. At the beginning of each acquisition trial, the rats are placed at 1 of 4 start points (North, South, East, and West) around the edge of the board. Across the 8 trials of each day (intertrial interval was approximately 15 min), 2 trials are given from each of the 4 start points, and the sequence is counterbalanced within each group. A trial is terminated when the rat locates the water or after 5 min, whichever comes first. If the rat fails to find the water within 5 min, it is guided to the correct well and allowed to drink. Once the water is located, the rat is allowed to drink the water before being returned to his home cage. Following each training session, the rats are allowed to drink freely for 1 h.  Phase III: Retention probe  A 5-min probe trial is given a couple of weeks after training. The trial begins by placing the rat at 1 of 2 start points around the edge of the Oasis platform. Start points are always in 1 of the 2 quadrants adjacent to the quadrant that contains the training well location. For example, for rats with training wells in the North, start points for the probe trial are either West or East (counterbalanced within each group). No water is available during the probe trial. Probe trials on the Oasis maze differ in 2 important ways from probe trials in the Morris water maze. First, 5-min probe trials are used, rather than 1-min probe trials, to ensure that rats explore a substantial portion of the Oasis maze. Second, in the Oasis maze rats have a strong tendency to explore the edges of the board and also to return to the start point. For these reasons, chance performance cannot be calculated in a straightforward way. Chance performance can be estimated by assessing the performance of the RANDOM group (because rats in this group could not acquire a memory for a specific spatial location). To do this, the percentage of time that a trained rat spend within a 58-cm- diameter circle around the trained well is compared with the percentage of time that rats in the RANDOM group spend in this same region (target locations for the RANDOM group are counterbalanced across rats). A 58-cm circle is the diameter of the largest circle that could be completely contained within 1 quadrant of the maze.

The primary melody is a twelve-bar blues.Inside the Music of Brian Wilson: The Songs, Sounds and Influences of the Beach Boys' Founding Genius, Lambert, Phillip, p.128 It was released on their 1963 album Surfin' U.S.A. and was also released on their 1963 album Little Deuce Coupe. It was also released as the B-side of the \\"Surfin' U.S.A.\\" single. The single peaked at number 23 in the US on the 'Billboard' Hot 100 chart (number seven on the United Press International chart published in newspapers), and number 34 in the UK History The song details a drag race between a Super-Stock 413 cu. in.-powered 1962 Dodge Dart and a fuel-injected 1963 Chevrolet Corvette Sting Ray and is derived from a longer poem by Christian. The song is sung from the perspective of the driver of the Sting Ray who brags that he will \\"shut down\\" the 413. (In hot rod racing slang, to \\"shut down\\" someone means to beat that person in a race.) While the implication is that the Sting Ray will win the race, the song ends before the end of the race with the 413 still in the lead, with the Sting Ray closing the gap. Although the race is often interpreted as having an inconclusive outcome, the lyrics in the outro refrain do state, \\"Shut it off, shut it off/Buddy now I shut you down\\", clearly indicating that the narrator, in his Corvette Sting Ray, has in fact won the race, as he tells the Dodge 413's driver to \\"shut off\\" the car's engine and accept the fact that he has just been \\"shut down\\". (It must be said however that many classic car enthusiasts and experienced muscle car drag racers have suggested over the years, that in actuality, all things being equal (ie. drivers of equal skill), an early 1960s SS Dodge Dart (most likely the 1962 Max Wedge variant) with its 413 cu. in. engine with twin 4-barrel carburetors (\\"dual quads\\") and ram-air induction, producing 410‚Äì420 horsepower, 460‚Äì470 torque, would have most likely easily beat a 1963 Chevy Corvette Sting Ray with its fuel injected 327 cu. in. engine producing roughly 350‚Äì360 horsepower, 352 torque. Also, the fact that the narrator even says that his \\"slicks\\" (tires) are starting to spin (lose traction) near the start of the race, and that the Dodge is \\"really digging in\\" with good traction, further suggests that it is highly unlikely that the singer's Sting Ray would have been able to catch up and overtake the superior powered and tractional Dodge Dart 413 in a ¬º mile drag race, even if he did power shift and ride the clutch enough to burn the pressure plates.)

In 1963, the site was connected to the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) Data Centre (DC-31) at CFB Goose Bay, and the site was upgraded to an AN/FPS-93A and AN/TPS-502 radars. On 30 June 1971, the USAF transferred control of the site to the Canadian Forces, which closed the facility. North Warning System A long range, phased array AN/FPS-117 3-dimensional air search surveillance radar and a doppler AN/FPS-124 short- range surveillance radar were installed in November 1989 as part of the North Warning System to cover any radar surveillance gaps. The new site (LAB-2) consists of a radar towers, communications facility, and storage and tunnel connected buildings for personnel.

It was released on their 1971 album Surf's Up. The lead vocals were performed by Rieley, who was also the Beach Boys' manager at the time. The song's lyric was inspired by Brian's feelings toward environmental pollution. It was performed live only once by the Beach Boys, at the Long Beach Arena in Long Beach, CA on December 3, 1971. The bandmembers reportedly coaxed Brian out from the side of the stage to play organ while Rieley sang it. Composition According to Rieley, AllMusic interpreted the song's subject to be autobiographical, calling it \\"one of Brian's most deeply touching and bizarre compositions‚Ä¶lamenting his long life amid the pollution and grime of a city park while the somber tones of a pipe organ build atmosphere.\\" Recording The instrumental track was made in a few days. Rieley has also recounted that on the day they were to record the lead vocal, Rieley was with the engineer in the control room, and Brian and Carl Wilson were in the studio. Brian did a few warm-up takes and then, dramatically animated as was his wont, tore the headphones from his ears and exclaimed that he needed Rieley to help him. Rieley went out into the studio and he pleaded that Brian just wasn't getting the feeling that he intended with the lyric. Brian insisted Rieley show him what to do, and handed Rieley the headphones. Rieley did about 5 takes of the song. It was after one of those that Wilson burst from the control booth to the studio and, unexpectedly to Rieley, exclaimed that he had just done the final lead vocal. Although he initially presumed it to be \\"another Brian Wilson cop-out\\", Carl explained that everybody had agreed Rieley was fit to sing the lead vocal, and had worked out a plan to trick him into singing it.

The human mitochondrial DNA. Human genetic variation is the genetic differences in and among populations. There may be multiple variants of any given gene in the human population (alleles), a situation called polymorphism. No two humans are genetically identical. Even monozygotic twins (who develop from one zygote) have infrequent genetic differences due to mutations occurring during development and gene copy-number variation. Differences between individuals, even closely related individuals, are the key to techniques such as genetic fingerprinting. As of 2017, there are a total of 324 million known variants from sequenced human genomes. As of 2015, the typical difference between the genomes of two individuals was estimated at 20 million base pairs (or 0.6% of the total of 3.2 billion base pairs). Alleles occur at different frequencies in different human populations. Populations that are more geographically and ancestrally remote tend to differ more. The differences between populations represent a small proportion of overall human genetic variation. Populations also differ in the quantity of variation among their members. The greatest divergence between populations is found in sub-Saharan Africa, consistent with the recent African origin of non-African populations. Populations also vary in the proportion and locus of introgressed genes they received by archaic admixture both inside and outside of Africa. The study of human genetic variation has evolutionary significance and medical applications. It can help scientists understand ancient human population migrations as well as how human groups are biologically related to one another. For medicine, study of human genetic variation may be important because some disease-causing alleles occur more often in people from specific geographic regions. New findings show that each human has on average 60 new mutations compared to their parents.  Causes of variation  Causes of differences between individuals include independent assortment, the exchange of genes (crossing over and recombination) during reproduction (through meiosis) and various mutational events. There are at least three reasons why genetic variation exists between populations. Natural selection may confer an adaptive advantage to individuals in a specific environment if an allele provides a competitive advantage. Alleles under selection are likely to occur only in those geographic regions where they confer an advantage. A second important process is genetic drift, which is the effect of random changes in the gene pool, under conditions where most mutations are neutral (that is, they do not appear to have any positive or negative selective effect on the organism). Finally, small migrant populations have statistical differences - called the founder effect - from the overall populations where they originated; when these migrants settle new areas, their descendant population typically differs from their population of origin: different genes predominate and it is less genetically diverse. In humans, the main cause is genetic drift. Serial founder effects and past small population size (increasing the likelihood of genetic drift) may have had an important influence in neutral differences between populations. The second main cause of genetic variation is due to the high degree of neutrality of most mutations. A small, but significant number of genes appear to have undergone recent natural selection, and these selective pressures are sometimes specific to one region. Measures of variation Genetic variation among humans occurs on many scales, from gross alterations in the human karyotype to single nucleotide changes. Chromosome abnormalities are detected in 1 of 160 live human births. Apart from sex chromosome disorders, most cases of aneuploidy result in death of the developing fetus (miscarriage); the most common extra autosomal chromosomes among live births are 21, 18 and 13. Nucleotide diversity is the average proportion of nucleotides that differ between two individuals. As of 2004, the human nucleotide diversity was estimated to be 0.1% to 0.4% of base pairs. In 2015, the 1000 Genomes Project, which sequenced one thousand individuals from 26 human populations, found that \\"a typical [individual] genome differs from the reference human genome at 4.1 million to 5.0 million sites ‚Ä¶ affecting 20 million bases of sequence\\"; the latter figure corresponds to 0.6% of total number of base pairs. Nearly all (>99.9%) of these sites are small differences, either single nucleotide polymorphisms or brief insertions or deletions (indels) in the genetic sequence, but structural variations account for a greater number of base-pairs than the SNPs and indels. , the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Database (dbSNP), which lists SNP and other variants, listed 324 million variants found in sequenced human genomes. = Single nucleotide polymorphisms = DNA molecule 1 differs from DNA molecule 2 at a single base-pair location (a C/T polymorphism). A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is a difference in a single nucleotide between members of one species that occurs in at least 1% of the population. The 2,504 individuals characterized by the 1000 Genomes Project had 84.7 million SNPs among them. SNPs are the most common type of sequence variation, estimated in 1998 to account for 90% of all sequence variants. Other sequence variations are single base exchanges, deletions and insertions. SNPs occur on average about every 100 to 300 bases and so are the major source of heterogeneity. A functional, or non-synonymous, SNP is one that affects some factor such as gene splicing or messenger RNA, and so causes a phenotypic difference between members of the species. About 3% to 5% of human SNPs are functional (see International HapMap Project). Neutral, or synonymous SNPs are still useful as genetic markers in genome-wide association studies, because of their sheer number and the stable inheritance over generations. A coding SNP is one that occurs inside a gene. There are 105 Human Reference SNPs that result in premature stop codons in 103 genes. This corresponds to 0.5% of coding SNPs. They occur due to segmental duplication in the genome. These SNPs result in loss of protein, yet all these SNP alleles are common and are not purified in negative selection. = Structural variation = Structural variation is the variation in structure of an organism's chromosome. Structural variations, such as copy-number variation and deletions, inversions, insertions and duplications, account for much more human genetic variation than single nucleotide diversity. This was concluded in 2007 from analysis of the diploid full sequences of the genomes of two humans: Craig Venter and James D. Watson. This added to the two haploid sequences which were amalgamations of sequences from many individuals, published by the Human Genome Project and Celera Genomics respectively. According to the 1000 Genomes Project, a typical human has 2,100 to 2,500 structural variations, which include approximately 1,000 large deletions, 160 copy-number variants, 915 Alu insertions, 128 L1 insertions, 51 SVA insertions, 4 NUMTs, and 10 inversions.  Copy number variation  A copy-number variation (CNV) is a difference in the genome due to deleting or duplicating large regions of DNA on some chromosome. It is estimated that 0.4% of the genomes of unrelated humans differ with respect to copy number. When copy number variation is included, human-to-human genetic variation is estimated to be at least 0.5% (99.5% similarity). Copy number variations are inherited but can also arise during development. A visual map with the regions with high genomic variation of the modern-human reference assembly relatively to a Neanderthal of 50k has been built by Pratas et al. = Epigenetics = Epigenetic variation is variation in the chemical tags that attach to DNA and affect how genes get read. The tags, \\"called epigenetic markings, act as switches that control how genes can be read.\\" At some alleles, the epigenetic state of the DNA, and associated phenotype, can be inherited across generations of individuals. = Genetic variability = Genetic variability is a measure of the tendency of individual genotypes in a population to vary (become different) from one another. Variability is different from genetic diversity, which is the amount of variation seen in a particular population. The variability of a trait is how much that trait tends to vary in response to environmental and genetic influences. = Clines = In biology, a cline is a continuum of species, populations, varieties, or forms of organisms that exhibit gradual phenotypic and/or genetic differences over a geographical area, typically as a result of environmental heterogeneity. In the scientific study of human genetic variation, a gene cline can be rigorously defined and subjected to quantitative metrics. = Haplogroups = In the study of molecular evolution, a haplogroup is a group of similar haplotypes that share a common ancestor with a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mutation. Haplogroups pertain to deep ancestral origins dating back thousands of years. The most commonly studied human haplogroups are Y-chromosome (Y-DNA) haplogroups and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroups, both of which can be used to define genetic populations. Y-DNA is passed solely along the patrilineal line, from father to son, while mtDNA is passed down the matrilineal line, from mother to both daughter or son. The Y-DNA and mtDNA may change by chance mutation at each generation. = Variable number tandem repeats = A variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) is the variation of length of a tandem repeat. A tandem repeat is the adjacent repetition of a short nucleotide sequence. Tandem repeats exist on many chromosomes, and their length varies between individuals. Each variant acts as an inherited allele, so they are used for personal or parental identification. Their analysis is useful in genetics and biology research, forensics, and DNA fingerprinting. Short tandem repeats (about 5 base pairs) are called microsatellites, while longer ones are called minisatellites. History and geographic distribution Map of the migration of modern humans out of Africa, based on mitochondrial DNA. Colored rings indicate thousand years before present. Genetic distance map by Magalh√£es et al. (2012) =Recent African origin of modern humans= The recent African origin of modern humans paradigm assumes the dispersal of non-African populations of anatomically modern humans after 70,000 years ago. Dispersal within Africa occurred significantly earlier, at least 130,000 years ago. The \\"out of Africa\\" theory originates in the 19th century, as a tentative suggestion in Charles Darwin's Descent of Man, but remained speculative until the 1980s when it was supported by study of present-day mitochondrial DNA, combined with evidence from physical anthropology of archaic specimens. According to a 2000 study of Y-chromosome sequence variation, human Y-chromosomes trace ancestry to Africa, and the descendants of the derived lineage left Africa and eventually were replaced by archaic human Y-chromosomes in Eurasia. The study also shows that a minority of contemporary populations in East Africa and the Khoisan are the descendants of the most ancestral patrilineages of anatomically modern humans that left Africa 35,000 to 89,000 years ago. Other evidence supporting the theory is that variations in skull measurements decrease with distance from Africa at the same rate as the decrease in genetic diversity. Human genetic diversity decreases in native populations with migratory distance from Africa, and this is thought to be due to bottlenecks during human migration, which are events that temporarily reduce population size. A 2009 genetic clustering study, which genotyped 1327 polymorphic markers in various African populations, identified six ancestral clusters. The clustering corresponded closely with ethnicity, culture and language. A 2018 whole genome sequencing study of the world's populations observed similar clusters among the populations in Africa. At K=9, distinct ancestral components defined the Afroasiatic-speaking populations inhabiting North Africa and Northeast Africa; the Nilo-Saharan-speaking populations in Northeast Africa and East Africa; the Ari populations in Northeast Africa; the Niger-Congo-speaking populations in West-Central Africa, West Africa, East Africa and Southern Africa; the Pygmy populations in Central Africa; and the Khoisan populations in Southern Africa. = Population genetics = Because of the common ancestry of all humans, only a small number of variants have large differences in frequency between populations. However, some rare variants in the world's human population are much more frequent in at least one population (more than 5%). Genetic variation It is commonly assumed that early humans left Africa, and thus must have passed through a population bottleneck before their African-Eurasian divergence around 100,000 years ago (ca. 3,000 generations). The rapid expansion of a previously small population has two important effects on the distribution of genetic variation. First, the so- called founder effect occurs when founder populations bring only a subset of the genetic variation from their ancestral population. Second, as founders become more geographically separated, the probability that two individuals from different founder populations will mate becomes smaller. The effect of this assortative mating is to reduce gene flow between geographical groups and to increase the genetic distance between groups. The expansion of humans from Africa affected the distribution of genetic variation in two other ways. First, smaller (founder) populations experience greater genetic drift because of increased fluctuations in neutral polymorphisms. Second, new polymorphisms that arose in one group were less likely to be transmitted to other groups as gene flow was restricted. Populations in Africa tend to have lower amounts of linkage disequilibrium than do populations outside Africa, partly because of the larger size of human populations in Africa over the course of human history and partly because the number of modern humans who left Africa to colonize the rest of the world appears to have been relatively low. In contrast, populations that have undergone dramatic size reductions or rapid expansions in the past and populations formed by the mixture of previously separate ancestral groups can have unusually high levels of linkage disequilibrium = Distribution of variation = Human genetic variation calculated from genetic data representing 346 microsatellite loci taken from 1484 individuals in 78 human populations. The upper graph illustrates that as populations are further from East Africa, they have declining genetic diversity as measured in average number of microsatellite repeats at each of the loci. The bottom chart illustrates isolation by distance. Populations with a greater distance between them are more dissimilar (as measured by the Fst statistic) than those which are geographically close to one another. The horizontal axis of both charts is geographic distance as measured along likely routes of human migration. (Chart from Kanitz et al. 2018) The distribution of genetic variants within and among human populations are impossible to describe succinctly because of the difficulty of defining a \\"population,\\" the clinal nature of variation, and heterogeneity across the genome (Long and Kittles 2003). In general, however, an average of 85% of genetic variation exists within local populations, ~7% is between local populations within the same continent, and ~8% of variation occurs between large groups living on different continents. The recent African origin theory for humans would predict that in Africa there exists a great deal more diversity than elsewhere and that diversity should decrease the further from Africa a population is sampled. Phenotypic variation Sub-Saharan Africa has the most human genetic diversity and the same has been shown to hold true for phenotypic variation in skull form.Manica, Andrea, William Amos, Fran√ßois Balloux, and Tsunehiko Hanihara. ‚ÄúThe Effect of Ancient Population Bottlenecks on Human Phenotypic Variation.‚Äù Nature 448, no. 7151 (July 2007): 346‚Äì48. https://doi.org/10.1038/nature05951. Phenotype is connected to genotype through gene expression. Genetic diversity decreases smoothly with migratory distance from that region, which many scientists believe to be the origin of modern humans, and that decrease is mirrored by a decrease in phenotypic variation. Skull measurements are an example of a physical attribute whose within-population variation decreases with distance from Africa. The distribution of many physical traits resembles the distribution of genetic variation within and between human populations (American Association of Physical Anthropologists 1996; Keita and Kittles 1997). For example, ~90% of the variation in human head shapes occurs within continental groups, and ~10% separates groups, with a greater variability of head shape among individuals with recent African ancestors (Relethford 2002). A prominent exception to the common distribution of physical characteristics within and among groups is skin color. Approximately 10% of the variance in skin color occurs within groups, and ~90% occurs between groups (Relethford 2002). This distribution of skin color and its geographic patterning ‚Äî with people whose ancestors lived predominantly near the equator having darker skin than those with ancestors who lived predominantly in higher latitudes ‚Äî indicate that this attribute has been under strong selective pressure. Darker skin appears to be strongly selected for in equatorial regions to prevent sunburn, skin cancer, the photolysis of folate, and damage to sweat glands. Understanding how genetic diversity in the human population impacts various levels of gene expression is an active area of research. While earlier studies focused on the relationship between DNA variation and RNA expression, more recent efforts are characterizing the genetic control of various aspects of gene expression including chromatin states, translation, and protein levels. A study published in 2007 found that 25% of genes showed different levels of gene expression between populations of European and Asian descent. The primary cause of this difference in gene expression was thought to be SNPs in gene regulatory regions of DNA. Another study published in 2007 found that approximately 83% of genes were expressed at different levels among individuals and about 17% between populations of European and African descent. = Wright's Fixation index as measure of variation = The population geneticist Sewall Wright developed the fixation index (often abbreviated to FST) as a way of measuring genetic differences between populations. This statistic is often used in taxonomy to compare differences between any two given populations by measuring the genetic differences among and between populations for individual genes, or for many genes simultaneously. It is often stated that the fixation index for humans is about 0.15. This translates to an estimated 85% of the variation measured in the overall human population is found within individuals of the same population, and about 15% of the variation occurs between populations. These estimates imply that any two individuals from different populations are almost as likely to be more similar to each other than either is to a member of their own group. \\"The shared evolutionary history of living humans has resulted in a high relatedness among all living people, as indicated for example by the very low fixation index (FST) among living human populations.\\" Richard Lewontin, who affirmed these ratios, thus concluded neither \\"race\\" nor \\"subspecies\\" were appropriate or useful ways to describe human populations. Wright himself believed that values >0.25 represent very great genetic variation and that an FST of 0.15‚Äì0.25 represented great variation. However, about 5% of human variation occurs between populations within continents, therefore FST values between continental groups of humans (or races) of as low as 0.1 (or possibly lower) have been found in some studies, suggesting more moderate levels of genetic variation. Graves (1996) has countered that FST should not be used as a marker of subspecies status, as the statistic is used to measure the degree of differentiation between populations, although see also Wright (1978).* Jeffrey Long and Rick Kittles give a long critique of the application of FST to human populations in their 2003 paper \\"Human Genetic Diversity and the Nonexistence of Biological Races\\". They find that the figure of 85% is misleading because it implies that all human populations contain on average 85% of all genetic diversity. They argue the underlying statistical model incorrectly assumes equal and independent histories of variation for each large human population. A more realistic approach is to understand that some human groups are parental to other groups and that these groups represent paraphyletic groups to their descent groups. For example, under the recent African origin theory the human population in Africa is paraphyletic to all other human groups because it represents the ancestral group from which all non-African populations derive, but more than that, non-African groups only derive from a small non-representative sample of this African population. This means that all non-African groups are more closely related to each other and to some African groups (probably east Africans) than they are to others, and further that the migration out of Africa represented a genetic bottleneck, with much of the diversity that existed in Africa not being carried out of Africa by the emigrating groups. Under this scenario, human populations do not have equal amounts of local variability, but rather diminished amounts of diversity the further from Africa any population lives. Long and Kittles find that rather than 85% of human genetic diversity existing in all human populations, about 100% of human diversity exists in a single African population, whereas only about 70% of human genetic diversity exists in a population derived from New Guinea. Long and Kittles argued that this still produces a global human population that is genetically homogeneous compared to other mammalian populations. = Archaic admixture = There is a hypothesis that anatomically modern humans interbred with Neanderthals during the Middle Paleolithic. In May 2010, the Neanderthal Genome Project presented genetic evidence that interbreeding did likely take place and that a small but significant portion of Neanderthal admixture is present in the DNA of modern Eurasians and Oceanians, and nearly absent in sub-Saharan African populations. Between 4% and 6% of the genome of Melanesians (represented by the Papua New Guinean and Bougainville Islander) are thought to derive from Denisova hominins ‚Äì a previously unknown species which shares a common origin with Neanderthals. It was possibly introduced during the early migration of the ancestors of Melanesians into Southeast Asia. This history of interaction suggests that Denisovans once ranged widely over eastern Asia. Thus, Melanesians emerge as the most archaic-admixed population, having Denisovan/Neanderthal-related admixture of ~8%. In a study published in 2013, Jeffrey Wall from University of California studied whole sequence-genome data and found higher rates of introgression in Asians compared to Europeans. Hammer et al. tested the hypothesis that contemporary African genomes have signatures of gene flow with archaic human ancestors and found evidence of archaic admixture in African genomes, suggesting that modest amounts of gene flow were widespread throughout time and space during the evolution of anatomically modern humans. Categorization of the world population Chart showing human genetic clustering. New data on human genetic variation has reignited the debate about a possible biological basis for categorization of humans into races. Most of the controversy surrounds the question of how to interpret the genetic data and whether conclusions based on it are sound. Some researchers argue that self-identified race can be used as an indicator of geographic ancestry for certain health risks and medications. Although the genetic differences among human groups are relatively small, these differences in certain genes such as duffy, ABCC11, SLC24A5, called ancestry-informative markers (AIMs) nevertheless can be used to reliably situate many individuals within broad, geographically based groupings. For example, computer analyses of hundreds of polymorphic loci sampled in globally distributed populations have revealed the existence of genetic clustering that roughly is associated with groups that historically have occupied large continental and subcontinental regions (Rosenberg et al. 2002; Bamshad et al. 2003). Some commentators have argued that these patterns of variation provide a biological justification for the use of traditional racial categories. They argue that the continental clusterings correspond roughly with the division of human beings into sub-Saharan Africans; Europeans, Western Asians, Central Asians, Southern Asians and Northern Africans; Eastern Asians, Southeast Asians, Polynesians and Native Americans; and other inhabitants of Oceania (Melanesians, Micronesians & Australian Aborigines) (Risch et al. 2002). Other observers disagree, saying that the same data undercut traditional notions of racial groups (King and Motulsky 2002; Calafell 2003; Tishkoff and Kidd 2004). They point out, for example, that major populations considered races or subgroups within races do not necessarily form their own clusters. Furthermore, because human genetic variation is clinal, many individuals affiliate with two or more continental groups. Thus, the genetically based \\"biogeographical ancestry\\" assigned to any given person generally will be broadly distributed and will be accompanied by sizable uncertainties (Pfaff et al. 2004). In many parts of the world, groups have mixed in such a way that many individuals have relatively recent ancestors from widely separated regions. Although genetic analyses of large numbers of loci can produce estimates of the percentage of a person's ancestors coming from various continental populations (Shriver et al. 2003; Bamshad et al. 2004), these estimates may assume a false distinctiveness of the parental populations, since human groups have exchanged mates from local to continental scales throughout history (Cavalli-Sforza et al. 1994; Hoerder 2002). Even with large numbers of markers, information for estimating admixture proportions of individuals or groups is limited, and estimates typically will have wide confidence intervals (Pfaff et al. 2004). = Genetic clustering = Genetic data can be used to infer population structure and assign individuals to groups that often correspond with their self-identified geographical ancestry. Jorde and Wooding (2004) argued that \\"Analysis of many loci now yields reasonably accurate estimates of genetic similarity among individuals, rather than populations. Clustering of individuals is correlated with geographic origin or ancestry.\\" However, identification by geographic origin may quickly break down when considering historical ancestry shared between individuals back in time. An analysis of autosomal SNP data from the International HapMap Project (Phase II) and CEPH Human Genome Diversity Panel samples was published in 2009. The study of 53 populations taken from the HapMap and CEPH data (1138 unrelated individuals) suggested that natural selection may shape the human genome much more slowly than previously thought, with factors such as migration within and among continents more heavily influencing the distribution of genetic variations. See also: . . A similar study published in 2010 found strong genome-wide evidence for selection due to changes in ecoregion, diet, and subsistence particularly in connection with polar ecoregions, with foraging, and with a diet rich in roots and tubers. In a 2016 study, principal component analysis of genome-wide data was capable of recovering previously-known targets for positive selection (without prior definition of populations) as well as a number of new candidate genes. = Forensic anthropology = Forensic anthropologists can determine aspects of geographic ancestry (i.e. Asian, African, or European) from skeletal remains with a high degree of accuracy by analyzing skeletal measurements. According to some studies , individual test methods such as mid-facial measurements and femur traits can identify the geographic ancestry and by extension the racial category to which an individual would have been assigned during their lifetime, with over 80% accuracy, and in combination can be even more accurate . However, the skeletons of people who have recent ancestry in different geographical regions can exhibit characteristics of more than one ancestral group and, hence, cannot be identified as belonging to any single ancestral group . Triangle plot shows average admixture of five North American ethnic groups. Individuals that self-identify with each group can be found at many locations on the map, but on average groups tend to cluster differently. = Gene flow and admixture = Gene flow between two populations reduces the average genetic distance between the populations, only totally isolated human populations experience no gene flow and most populations have continuous gene flow with other neighboring populations which create the clinal distribution observed for moth genetic variation. When gene flow takes place between well- differentiated genetic populations the result is referred to as \\"genetic admixture\\". Admixture mapping is a technique used to study how genetic variants cause differences in disease rates between population. Recent admixture populations that trace their ancestry to multiple continents are well suited for identifying genes for traits and diseases that differ in prevalence between parental populations. African-American populations have been the focus of numerous population genetic and admixture mapping studies, including studies of complex genetic traits such as white cell count, body- mass index, prostate cancer and renal disease. An analysis of phenotypic and genetic variation including skin color and socio-economic status was carried out in the population of Cape Verde which has a well documented history of contact between Europeans and Africans. The studies showed that pattern of admixture in this population has been sex-biased and there is a significant interactions between socio economic status and skin color independent of the skin color and ancestry. Another study shows an increased risk of graft- versus-host disease complications after transplantation due to genetic variants in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and non-HLA proteins.  Health  Differences in allele frequencies contribute to group differences in the incidence of some monogenic diseases, and they may contribute to differences in the incidence of some common diseases. For the monogenic diseases, the frequency of causative alleles usually correlates best with ancestry, whether familial (for example, Ellis-van Creveld syndrome among the Pennsylvania Amish), ethnic (Tay‚ÄìSachs disease among Ashkenazi Jewish populations), or geographical (hemoglobinopathies among people with ancestors who lived in malarial regions). To the extent that ancestry corresponds with racial or ethnic groups or subgroups, the incidence of monogenic diseases can differ between groups categorized by race or ethnicity, and health-care professionals typically take these patterns into account in making diagnoses. Even with common diseases involving numerous genetic variants and environmental factors, investigators point to evidence suggesting the involvement of differentially distributed alleles with small to moderate effects. Frequently cited examples include hypertension (Douglas et al. 1996), diabetes (Gower et al. 2003), obesity (Fernandez et al. 2003), and prostate cancer (Platz et al. 2000). However, in none of these cases has allelic variation in a susceptibility gene been shown to account for a significant fraction of the difference in disease prevalence among groups, and the role of genetic factors in generating these differences remains uncertain (Mountain and Risch 2004). Some other variations on the other hand are beneficial to human, as they prevent certain diseases and increase the chance to adapt to the environment. For example, mutation in CCR5 gene that protects against AIDS. CCR5 gene is absent on the surface of cell due to mutation. Without CCR5 gene on the surface, there is nothing for HIV viruses to grab on and bind into. Therefore, the mutation on CCR5 gene decreases the chance of an individual's risk with AIDS. The mutation in CCR5 is also quite popular in certain areas, with more than 14% of the population carry the mutation in Europe and about 6‚Äì10% in Asia and North Africa. HIV attachment Apart from mutations, many genes that may have aided humans in ancient times plague humans today. For example, it is suspected that genes that allow humans to more efficiently process food are those that make people susceptible to obesity and diabetes today. Neil Risch of Stanford University has proposed that self-identified race/ethnic group could be a valid means of categorization in the US for public health and policy considerations. A 2002 paper by Noah Rosenberg's group makes a similar claim: \\"The structure of human populations is relevant in various epidemiological contexts. As a result of variation in frequencies of both genetic and nongenetic risk factors, rates of disease and of such phenotypes as adverse drug response vary across populations. Further, information about a patient‚Äôs population of origin might provide health care practitioners with information about risk when direct causes of disease are unknown.\\" However, in 2018 Noah Rosenberg released a study arguing against genetically essentialist ideas of health disparities between populations stating environmental variants are a more likely cause Interpreting polygenic scores, polygenic adaptation, and human phenotypic differences  Genome projects  Human genome projects are scientific endeavors that determine or study the structure of the human genome. The Human Genome Project was a landmark genome project.

Some interpretations are often deconstructionist and poststructuralist in that they critically analyze the historical construction and development of racial categories. Social interpretation of physical variation = Incongruities of racial classifications= The biological anthropologist Jonathan Marks (1995) argued that even as the idea of \\"race\\" was becoming a powerful organizing principle in many societies, the shortcomings of the concept were apparent. In the Old World, the gradual transition in appearances from one racial group to adjacent racial groups emphasized that \\"one variety of mankind does so sensibly pass into the other, that you cannot mark out the limits between them,\\" as Blumenbach observed in his writings on human variation.J. Marks, Human Biodiversity: Genes, Race, and History (New York: Aldine de Gruyter, 1995), 54. In parts of the Americas, the situation was somewhat different. The immigrants to the New World came largely from widely separated regions of the Old World‚Äîwestern and northern Europe, western Africa, and, later, eastern Asia and southern and eastern Europe. In the Americas, the immigrant populations began to mix among themselves and with the indigenous inhabitants of the continent. In the United States, for example, most people who self-identify as African American have some European ancestors‚Äîin one analysis of genetic markers that have differing frequencies between continents, European ancestry ranged from an estimated 7% for a sample of Jamaicans to ‚àº23% for a sample of African Americans from New Orleans. In a survey of college students who self-identified as white in a northeastern U.S. university, the west African and Native American genetic contribution were 0.7% and 3.2%. In the United States, social and legal conventions developed over time that forced individuals of mixed ancestry into simplified racial categories.Thomas F. Gossett, Race: The History of an Idea in America, New ed. (New York: Oxford University, 1997). An example is the \\"one-drop rule\\" implemented in some state laws that treated anyone with a single known African American ancestor as black.F. James Davis, Who is Black?: One Nation's Definition (University Park PA: State University of Pennsylvania, 1991). The decennial censuses conducted since 1790 in the United States also created an incentive to establish racial categories and fit people into those categories.M. Nobles, Shades of Citizenship: Race and the Census in Modern Politics (Stanford: Stanford University, 2000). In other countries in the Americas, where mixing among groups was more extensive, social non racial categories have tended to be more numerous and fluid, with people moving into or out of categories on the basis of a combination of socioeconomic status, social class, ancestry.Magnus M√∂rner, Race Mixture in the History of Latin America (Boston: Little Brown, 1967). Efforts to sort the increasingly mixed population of the United States into discrete racial categories generated many difficulties.P.R. Spickard, \\"The illogic of American racial categories,\\" in M.P.P. Root, ed., Racially mixed people in America (Newbury Park CA: Sage, 1992), 12‚Äì23. Additionally, efforts to track mixing between census racial groups led to a proliferation of categories (such as mulatto and octoroon) and \\"blood quantum\\" distinctions that became increasingly untethered from self- reported ancestry. A person's racial identity can change over time. One study found differences between self-ascribed race and Veterans Affairs administrative data. =Race as a social construct and populationism= The notion of a biological basis for race originally emerged through speculations surrounding the \\"blood purity\\" of Jews during the Spanish Inquisition, eventually translating to a general association of one's biology with their social and personal characteristics. In the 19th century, this recurring ideology was intensified in the development of the racial sciences, eugenics and ethnology, which meant to further categorize groups of humans in terms of biological superiority or inferiority. While the field of racial sciences, also known as scientific racism, has expired in history, these antiquated conceptions of race have persisted throughout the 21st century. (See also: Historical origins of racial classification) Contrary to popular belief that the division of the human species based on physical variations is natural, there exists no clear, reliable distinctions that bind people to such groupings. According to the American Anthropological Association, \\"Evidence from the analysis of genetics (e.g., DNA) indicates that most physical variation, about 94%, lies within so-called racial groups. Conventional geographic \\"racial\\" groupings differ from one another only in about 6% of their genes.\\" While there is a biological basis for differences in human phenotypes, most notably in skin color, the genetic variability of humans is found not amongst, but rather within racial groups ‚Äì meaning the perceived level of dissimilarity amongst the species has virtually no biological basis. Genetic diversity has characterized human survival, rendering the idea of a \\"pure\\" ancestry as obsolete. Under this interpretation, race is conceptualized through a lens of artificiality, rather than through the skeleton of a scientific discovery. As a result, scholars have begun to broaden discourses of race by defining it as a social construct and exploring the historical contexts that led to its inception and persistence in contemporary society. Most historians, anthropologists, and sociologists describe human races as a social construct, preferring instead the term population or ancestry, which can be given a clear operational definition. Even those who reject the formal concept of race, however, still use the word race in day-to-day speech. This may either be a matter of semantics, or an effect of an underlying cultural significance of race in racist societies. Regardless of the name, a working concept of sub-species grouping can be useful, because in the absence of cheap and widespread genetic tests, various race-linked gene mutations (see Cystic fibrosis, Lactose intolerance, Tay‚ÄìSachs disease and Sickle cell anemia) are difficult to address without recourse to a category between \\"individual\\" and \\"species\\". As genetic tests for such conditions become cheaper, and as detailed haplotype maps and SNP databases become available, identifiers of race should diminish. Also, increasing interracial marriage is reducing the predictive power of race. For example, babies born with Tay‚ÄìSachs disease in North America are not only or primarily Ashkenazi Jews, despite stereotypes to contrary; French Canadians, Louisiana Cajuns, and Irish-Americans also see high rates of the disease. Experts in the fields of genetics, law, and sociology have offered their opinions on the subject. Audrey Smedley and Brian D. Smedley of Virginia Commonwealth University Institute of Medicine discuss the anthropological and historical perspectives on ethnicity, culture, and race. They define culture as the habits acquired by a society. Smedley states \\"Ethnicity and culture are related phenomena and bear no intrinsic connection to human biological variations or race\\" (Smedley 17). The authors state using physical characteristics to define an ethnic identity is inaccurate. The variation of humans has actually decreased over time since, as the author states, \\"Immigration, intermating, intermarriage, and reproduction have led to increasing physical heterogeneity of peoples in many areas of the world\\" (Smedley 18). They referred to other experts and their research, pointing out that humans are 99% alike. That one percent is caused by natural genetic variation, and has nothing to do with the ethnic group of the subject. Racial classification in the United States started in the 1700s with three ethnically distinct groups. These groups were the white Europeans, Native Americans, and Africans. The concept of race was skewed around these times because of the social implications of belonging to one group or another. The view that one race is biologically different from another rose out of society's grasp for power and authority over other ethnic groups. This did not only happen in the United States but around the world as well. Society created race to create hierarchies in which the majority would prosper most. Another group of experts in sociology has written on this topic. Guang Guo, Yilan Fu, Yi Li, Kathleen Mullan Harris of the University of North Carolina department of sociology as well as Hedwig Lee (University of Washington Seattle), Tianji Cai (University of Macau) comment on remarks made by one expert. The debate is over DNA differences, or lack thereof, between different races. The research in the original article they are referring to uses different methods of DNA testing between distinct ethnic groups and compares them to other groups. Small differences were found, but those were not based on race. They were from biological differences caused from the region in which the people live. They describe that the small differences cannot be fully explained because the understanding of migration, intermarriage, and ancestry is unreliable at the individual level. Race cannot be related to ancestry based on the research on which they are commenting. They conclude that the idea of \\"races as biologically distinct peoples with differential abilities and behaviors has long been discredited by the scientific community\\" (2338). One more expert in the field has given her opinion. Ann Morning of the New York University Department of Sociology, and member of the American Sociological Association, discusses the role of biology in the social construction of race. She examines the relationship between genes and race and the social construction of social race clusters. Morning states that everyone is assigned to a racial group because of their physical characteristics. She identifies through her research the existence of DNA population clusters. She states that society would want to characterize these clusters as races. Society characterizes race as a set of physical characteristics. The clusters though have an overlap in physical characteristics and thus cannot be counted as a race by society or by science. Morning concludes that \\"Not only can constructivist theory accommodate or explain the occasional alignment of social classifications and genetic estimates that Shiao et al.'s model hypothesizes, but empirical research on human genetics is far from claiming‚Äîlet alone demonstrating‚Äîthat statistically inferred clusters are the equivalent of races\\" (Morning 203). Only using ethnic groups to map a genome is entirely inaccurate, instead every individual must be viewed as having their own wholly unique genome (unique in the 1%, not the 99% all humans share). Ian Haney L√≥pez, the John H. Boalt Professor of Law at the University of California, Berkeley explains ways race is a social construct. He uses examples from history of how race was socially constructed and interpreted. One such example was of the Hudgins v. Wright case. A slave woman sued for her freedom and the freedom of her two children on the basis that her grandmother was Native American. The race of the Wright had to be socially proven, and neither side could present enough evidence. Since the slave owner Hudgins bore the burden of proof, Wright and her children gained their freedom. L√≥pez uses this example to show the power of race in society. Human fate, he argues, still depends upon ancestry and appearance. Race is a powerful force in everyday life. These races are not determined by biology though, they are created by society to keep power with the majority. He describes that there are not any genetic characteristics that all blacks have that non-whites do not possess and vice versa. He uses the example of Mexican. It truly is a nationality, yet it has become a catch-all for all Hispanic nationalities. This simplification is wrong, L√≥pez argues, for it is not only inaccurate but it tends to treat all \\"Mexicans\\" as below fervent Americans. He describes that \\"More recently, genetic testing has made it clear the close connections all humans share, as well as the futility of explaining those differences that do exist in terms of racially relevant gene codes\\" (Lopez 199‚Äì200). Those differences clearly have no basis in ethnicity, so race is completely socially constructed. Some argue it is preferable when considering biological relations to think in terms of populations, and when considering cultural relations to think in terms of ethnicity, rather than of race. These developments had important consequences. For example, some scientists developed the notion of \\"population\\" to take the place of race. It is argued that this substitution is not simply a matter of exchanging one word for another. This view does not deny that there are physical differences among peoples; it simply claims that the historical conceptions of \\"race\\" are not particularly useful in accounting for these differences scientifically. In particular, it is claimed that: # knowing someone's \\"race\\" does not provide comprehensive predictive information about biological characteristics, and only absolutely predicts those traits that have been selected to define the racial categories, e.g. knowing a person's skin color, which is generally acknowledged to be one of the markers of race (or taken as a defining characteristic of race), does not allow good predictions of a person's blood type to be made. # in general, the worldwide distribution of human phenotypes exhibits gradual trends of difference across geographic zones, not the categorical differences of race; in particular, there are many peoples (like the San of S. W. Africa, or the people of northern India) who have phenotypes that do not neatly fit into the standard race categories. # focusing on race has historically led not only to seemingly insoluble disputes about classification (e.g. are the Japanese a distinct race, a mixture of races, or part of the East Asian race? and what about the Ainu?) but has also exposed disagreement about the criteria for making decisions‚Äîthe selection of phenotypic traits seemed arbitrary. Neven Sesardic has argued that such arguments are unsupported by empirical evidence and politically motivated. Arguing that races are not completely discrete biologically is a straw man argument. He argues \\"racial recognition is not actually based on a single trait (like skin color) but rather on a number of characteristics that are to a certain extent concordant and that jointly make the classification not only possible but fairly reliable as well\\". Forensic anthropologists can classify a person's race with an accuracy close to 100% using only skeletal remains if they take into consideration several characteristics at the same time. A.W.F. Edwards has argued similarly regarding genetic differences in \\"Human genetic diversity: Lewontin's fallacy\\". =Race in biomedicine= There is an active debate among biomedical researchers about the meaning and importance of race in their research. The primary impetus for considering race in biomedical research is the possibility of improving the prevention and treatment of diseases by predicting hard-to-ascertain factors on the basis of more easily ascertained characteristics. The most well-known examples of genetically determined disorders that vary in incidence between ethnic groups would be sickle cell disease and thalassemia among black and Mediterranean populations respectively and Tay‚ÄìSachs disease among people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. Some fear that the use of racial labels in biomedical research runs the risk of unintentionally exacerbating health disparities, so they suggest alternatives to the use of racial taxonomies. Case studies in the social construction of race =Race in the United States= In the United States since its early history, Native Americans, African-Americans and European- Americans were classified as belonging to different races. For nearly three centuries, the criteria for membership in these groups were similar, comprising a person's appearance, his fraction of known non-White ancestry, and his social circle.See \\"Chapter 9. How the Law Decided if You Were Black or White: The Early 1800s\\" in Legal History of the Color Line: The Rise and Triumph of the One-Drop Rule by Frank W. Sweet, . A summary of this chapter, with endnotes, is available online at How the Law Decided if You Were Black or White: The Early 1800s . But the criteria for membership in these races diverged in the late 19th century. During Reconstruction, increasing numbers of Americans began to consider anyone with \\"one drop\\" of \\"Black blood\\" to be Black.See chapters 15‚Äì20 of Legal History of the Color Line: The Rise and Triumph of the One-Drop Rule by Frank W. Sweet, . Summaries of these chapters, with endnotes, are available online at The Invention of the One-Drop Rule in the 1830s North . By the early 20th century, this notion of invisible blackness was made statutory in many states and widely adopted nationwide.See chapters 21‚Äì20 of Legal History of the Color Line: The Rise and Triumph of the One-Drop Rule by Frank W. Sweet, . Summaries of these chapters, with endnotes, are available online at Jim Crow Triumph of the One-Drop Rule . In contrast, Amerindians continue to be defined by a certain percentage of \\"Indian blood\\" (called blood quantum) due in large part to American slavery ethics. Race definitions in the United States The concept of race as used by the Census Bureau reflects self-identification by people according to the race or races with which they most closely identify. These categories are sociopolitical constructs and should not be interpreted as being scientific or anthropological in nature. They change from one census to another, and the racial categories include both racial and national-origin groups.\\"American Indian and Alaska Native persons, percent, 2000\\". =Race in Brazil= Compared to 19th-century United States, 20th-century Brazil was characterized by a relative absence of sharply defined racial groups. This pattern reflects a different history and different social relations. Basically, race in Brazil was recognized as the difference between ancestry (which determines genotype) and phenotypic differences. Racial identity was not governed by a rigid descent rule. A Brazilian child was never automatically identified with the racial type of one or both parents, nor were there only two categories to choose from. Over a dozen racial categories are recognized in conformity with the combinations of hair color, hair texture, eye color, and skin color. These types grade into each other like the colors of the spectrum, and no one category stands significantly isolated from the rest. That is, race referred to appearance, not heredity. Through this system of racial identification, parents and children and even brothers and sisters were frequently accepted as representatives of opposite racial types. In a fishing village in the state of Bahia, an investigator showed 100 people pictures of three sisters and they were asked to identify the races of each. In only six responses were the sisters identified by the same racial term. Fourteen responses used a different term for each sister. In another experiment nine portraits were shown to a hundred people. Forty different racial types were elicited. It was found, in addition, that a given Brazilian might be called by as many as thirteen different terms by other members of the community. These terms are spread out across practically the entire spectrum of theoretical racial types. A further consequence of the absence of a descent rule was that Brazilians apparently not only disagreed about the racial identity of specific individuals, but they also seemed to be in disagreement about the abstract meaning of the racial terms as defined by words and phrases. For example, 40% of a sample ranked moreno claro as a lighter type than mulato claro, while 60% reversed this order. A further note of confusion is that one person might employ different racial terms to describe the same person over a short time span. The choice of which racial description to use may vary according to both the personal relationships and moods of the individuals involved. The Brazilian census lists one's race according to the preference of the person being interviewed. As a consequence, hundreds of races appeared in the census results, ranging from blue (which is blacker than the usual black) to pink (which is whiter than the usual white). However, Brazilians are not so na√Øve to ignore one's racial origins just because of his (or her) better social status. An interesting example of this phenomenon has occurred recently, when the famous football (soccer) player Ronaldo declared publicly that he considered himself as White, thus linking racism to a form or another of class conflict. This caused a series of ironic notes on newspapers, which pointed out that he should have been proud of his African origin (which is obviously noticeable), a fact that must have made life for him (and for his ancestors) more difficult, so, being a successful personality was, in spite of that, a victory for him. What occurs in Brazil that differentiates it largely from the US or South Africa, for example, is that black or mixed-race people are, in fact, more accepted in social circles if they have more education, or have a successful life (a euphemism for \\"having a better salary\\"). As a consequence, inter-racial marriages are more common, and more accepted, among highly educated Afro-Brazilians than lower-educated ones. So, although the identification of a person by race is far more fluid and flexible in Brazil than in the U.S., there still are racial stereotypes and prejudices. African features have been considered less desirable; Blacks have been considered socially inferior, and Whites superior. These white supremacist values were a legacy of European colonization and the slave-based plantation system. The complexity of racial classifications in Brazil is reflective of the extent of miscegenation in Brazilian society, which remains highly, but not strictly, stratified along color lines. Henceforth, Brazil's desired image as a perfect \\"post-racist\\" country, composed of the \\"cosmic race\\" celebrated in 1925 by Jos√© Vasconcelos, must be met with caution, as sociologist Gilberto Freyre demonstrated in 1933 in Casa Grande e Senzala. =Race in politics and ethics= Michel Foucault argued the popular historical and political use of a non-essentialist notion of \\"race\\" used in the \\"race struggle\\" discourse during the 1688 Glorious Revolution and under Louis XIV's end of reign. In Foucault's view, this discourse developed in two different directions: Marxism, which seized the notion and transformed it into \\"class struggle\\" discourse, and racists, biologists and eugenicists, who paved the way for 20th century \\"state racism\\". During the Enlightenment, racial classifications were used to justify enslavement of those deemed to be of \\"inferior\\", non-White races, and thus supposedly best fitted for lives of toil under White supervision. These classifications made the distance between races seem nearly as broad as that between species, easing unsettling questions about the appropriateness of such treatment of humans. The practice was at the time generally accepted by both scientific and lay communities. Arthur Gobineau's An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races (1853‚Äì1855) was one of the milestones in the new racist discourse, along with Vacher de Lapouge's \\"anthroposociology\\" and Johann Gottfried Herder (1744‚Äì1803), who applied race to nationalist theory to develop militant ethnic nationalism. They posited the historical existence of national races such as German and French, branching from basal races supposed to have existed for millennia, such as the Aryan race, and believed political boundaries should mirror these supposed racial ones. Later, one of Hitler's favorite sayings was, \\"Politics is applied biology\\". Hitler's ideas of racial purity led to unprecedented atrocities in Europe. Since then, ethnic cleansing has occurred in Cambodia, the Balkans, Sudan, and Rwanda. In one sense, ethnic cleansing is another name for the tribal warfare and mass murder that has afflicted human society for ages. Racial inequality has been a concern of United States politicians and legislators since the country's founding. In the 19th century most White Americans (including abolitionists) explained racial inequality as an inevitable consequence of biological differences. Since the mid-20th century, political and civic leaders as well as scientists have debated to what extent racial inequality is cultural in origin. Some argue that current inequalities between Blacks and Whites are primarily cultural and historical, the result of past and present racism, slavery and segregation, and could be redressed through such programs as affirmative action and Head Start. Others work to reduce tax funding of remedial programs for minorities. They have based their advocacy on aptitude test data that, according to them, shows that racial ability differences are biological in origin and cannot be leveled even by intensive educational efforts. In electoral politics, many more ethnic minorities have won important offices in Western nations than in earlier times, although the highest offices tend to remain in the hands of Whites. In his famous Letter from Birmingham Jail, Martin Luther King Jr. observed: :History is the long and tragic story of the fact that privileged groups seldom give up their privileges voluntarily. Individuals may see the moral light and voluntarily give up their unjust posture; but as Reinhold Niebuhr has reminded us, groups are more immoral than individuals. King's hope, expressed in his I Have a Dream speech, was that the civil rights struggle would one day produce a society where people were not \\"judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character\\". Because of the identification of the concept of race with political oppression, many natural and social scientists today are wary of using the word \\"race\\" to refer to human variation, but instead use less emotive words such as \\"population\\" and \\"ethnicity\\". Some, however, argue that the concept of race, whatever the term used, is nevertheless of continuing utility and validity in scientific research. Race in law enforcement In an attempt to provide general descriptions that may facilitate the job of law enforcement officers seeking to apprehend suspects, the United States FBI employs the term \\"race\\" to summarize the general appearance (skin color, hair texture, eye shape, and other such easily noticed characteristics) of individuals whom they are attempting to apprehend. From the perspective of law enforcement officers, a description needs to capture the features that stand out most clearly in the perception within the given society. Thus, in the UK, Scotland Yard use a classification based on the ethnic composition of British society: W1 (White British), W2 (White Irish), W9 (Other White); M1 (White and black Caribbean), M2 (White and black African), M3 (White and Asian), M9 (Any other mixed background); A1 (Asian-Indian), A2 (Asian-Pakistani), A3 (Asian-Bangladeshi), A9 (Any other Asian background); B1 (Black Caribbean), B2 (Black African), B3 (Any other black background); O1 (Chinese), O9 (Any other). In the United States, the practice of racial profiling has been ruled to be both unconstitutional and also to constitute a violation of civil rights. There also an ongoing debate on the relationship between race and crime regarding the disproportional representation of certain minorities in all stages of the criminal justice system. Studies in racial taxonomy based on DNA cluster analysis has led law enforcement to pursue suspects based on their racial classification as derived from their DNA evidence left at the crime scene. DNA analysis has been successful in helping police determine the race of both victims and perpetrators. This classification is called \\"biogeographical ancestry\\".

The purpose of this arrangement is to diversify their holdings without triggering a \\"taxable event\\". Note that the tax is not avoided, just postponed; when the diversified holdings are eventually sold, tax will be due on the difference between the sales price and the original cost basis of the contributed stock. Criticism The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has investigated the use of these arrangements with reference to the potential for market abuse by directors not disclosing their effective divestment in stocks for which they are privy to sensitive market information.www.alwayson-network.com/ In addition, there is general criticism that tax revenue that might otherwise have been generated is avoided. Many holders of these positions may elect to hold the concentrated position and borrow against it rather than sell and pay the associated capital gains tax. Providers There are exchange funds for publicly held stock and private stock (pre-IPO). Eaton Vance is the largest of the public stock exchange fund providers and many of the large brokerage houses such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley etc. have exchange funds as well. Startup Exchange Fund and EB Exchange are the best known companies that specialize in exchange funds for privately held equity (stock of private companies). Detailed structure * Fund holding requirements: The fund needs to have at least 20% of its assets in \\"non-publicly traded\\" securities or real-estate. * For public exchange funds, at least seven years have to elapse between when an investor deposits their stock and when the basket of stocks is available for them to sell without realizing a step up in basis (paying taxes). However, this is not an issue with private stock exchange funds as the point is diversification, not tax deferral. * Liquidity: Public funds are generally not marginable. Private funds increase a participant's odds of liquidity.www.answers.com Public vs. private equity exchange funds Private equity exchange funds (those comprising stock in non-public companies) differ from public exchange funds in a few regards: * A main objective of private equity exchange funds is providing participants with downside risk protection, in case their own stock becomes worthless before they achieve a liquidity event (an IPO or acquisition.) The need for diversification is much more heightened than it is with public stock which may be sold at any time, if the holder wishes to bear the tax consequences. * When liquidity events occur within a private equity fund, proceeds are immediately distributed to limited partners, rather than being held or reinvested. The objective of these funds is liquidity as well as diversification. * Fund management fees are assessed on the basis of an expense budget, rather than a percent of the value, since valuation of the private equity holdings is uncertain.

Running for about in a general northeast‚Äìsouthwest direction, connecting rural portions of Dekalb County. SR 427 was originally introduced in 1932 routed between SR 1, north of Fort Wayne, and Auburn. By the early 1940s SR 427 made its way to the Ohio state line, west of Edon, Ohio. The southern end was moved twice, the first time to US 27 north of Waterloo and the second time to US 6 in Waterloo. Route description SR 427 begins in downtown Waterloo at the corner of Union Street (US 6) and Wayne Street. It follows Wayne Street northeast out of Waterloo entering rural Dekalb County. SR 427 has a three-way intersection with old US 27 soon after leaving Waterloo. Northeast of old US 27, SR 427 passes agriculture land before entering Hamilton. In Hamilton the road is concurrent with Wayne Street and passes by Hamilton Community School buildings. The road crosses an Indiana Northeastern Railroad track as it enters Steuben County. Wayne Street has an intersection with Bellefontaine Road where SR 1 joins SR 427 on Wayne Street. The road continues northeast passing by the southeast end of Hamilton Lake. Leaving Hamilton, SR 1 turns north as SR 427 continues northeast passing through rural Steuben County. The road turns east towards the Ohio state line, where it meets Ohio State Route 34. History SR 427 had its beginning in 1932 when it was designated from north of Fort Wayne to Auburn, replacing an old alignment of SR 1. The route between US 27, north of Waterloo, and the Ohio state line was authorized in 1934. The state highway commission removed the authorization on the section between US 27 and the town of Hamilton in 1935. In 1937 the section of road heading east from Hamilton officially becomes a state road. In 1941 the road between US 27 and Hamilton becomes a state road. East of the Hamilton two sharp curves were removed between 1956 and 1957. The southern end of SR 427 was moved from SR 1 near Fort Wayne to US 27 north of Waterloo in 1965.

Located between the cities of Calgary and Red Deer within the Calgary-Edmonton corridor, its municipal office is located north of the Town of Didsbury. Mountain View County is a member of the Central Alberta Economic Partnership, Alberta Association of Municipal Districts and Counties, and the Municipal Area Partnership.  History  The first government surveys of the area between Calgary and Edmonton were not made until 1883, around the time when the Canadian Pacific Railway arrived from Eastern Canada in Calgary, then just a small settlement. Just to the east of where the busy Queen Elizabeth II highway runs today, people and goods travelled between Calgary and Fort Edmonton by wagon along the original Calgary and Edmonton Trail. In 1890, the Calgary and Edmonton Railway was chartered, and construction began, with the line reaching the area now comprising the county by the end of that year. While a handful of squatters had arrived pre-1890, settlement in the area did not begin in earnest until the arrival of the C & E Railway. On July 27, 1891, the first through train made the trip from Calgary to Strathcona, marking the beginning of regular scheduled passenger train service for the next 60 years. The operation of Calgary & Edmonton Railway passed to the Canadian Pacific Railway, which continues to operate the line as its main Calgary-Edmonton connection. After 1891, homesteaders began to arrive in the region from across Europe and North America, with settlements sprouting up around the fourth (Carstairs), fifth (Didsbury) and sixth (Olds) sidings. Settlement in the early days was typified by ethnic and usually religious groups living in close-knit communities or colonies. Notable among them were a group of Mennonite families who homesteaded in the Didsbury area from Europe via Ontario around the turn of the 19th century. A large number of German settlers from the American Midwest also settled around Olds; and a group of Norwegian pioneers blazed a trail westward towards Sundre and Bergen. As the population grew, so did their needs. This led to the formation of local government, though the creation of local Improvement Districts. These were relatively small administrative units, generally no bigger than in size, and were responsible for a number of limited duties including setting local tax rates, and keeping track of necessary local improvements. In December 1911 the Alberta government brought forward new legislation designed to introduce greater self-government into rural areas of the province. Specifically, the Municipal Act of 1912 encouraged local improvement districts to consolidate with one another to form larger rural municipalities. Initially the response to the idea of consolidation was unenthusiastic. A majority of rural residents in Mountain View voted against consolidation with other L.I.D.'s in a series of plebiscites held in 1912. Only the Rural Municipality of Mountain View No. 310 would be created out of four improvement districts around Olds and Didsbury, making it one of 55 rural municipalities to come into existence province-wide on December 9, 1912. While Mountain View was the first to consolidate, others would soon follow their lead. The Municipal District of Mountain View No. 49 was formed into the County of Mountain View No. 17 as of January 1, 1961, with William J. Bagnall of Dogpound was selected as the county's first reeve. A municipal councillor prior to the county's formation, Bagnall would continue to serve as reeve until 1980. The newly formed county chose Didsbury as the location of its municipal office, and in October 1962, a new administration building was opened to house both the county administration and the school board. This building would serve the county until a new state- of-the-art office was built in 2005, near the Olds-Didsbury Airport along Highway 2A. On January 21, 1998, the County of Mountain View No. 17 officially changed its name to Mountain View County, as it continues to be known today.  Demographics  In the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Mountain View County recorded a population of 13,074 living in 5,025 of its 5,666 total private dwellings, a change from its 2011 population of 12,359. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016. In the 2011 Census, Mountain View County had a population of 12,359 living in 4,728 of its 5,351 total dwellings, a 0.4% change from its 2006 adjusted population of 12,308. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2011. The population of Mountain View County according to its 2007 municipal census is 12,570.  Economy  Oil and gas is the main economic driver of Mountain View County, along with agriculture, forestry and tourism.  Education  In the early 1890s the first schools began to organize in the area now comprising Mountain View County. By 1930, almost 90 school districts had been created to serve the region, with the one-room school house remaining a fixture of rural life until 1936, when the Social Credit government allowed for the creation of larger school divisions. As consolidation of rural municipalities continued throughput the 1940s and 50s, the provincial government moved to amalgamate municipalities and the local school boards. In 1955, the M.D. of Mountain View and Olds School Division No. 39 were made \\"coterminous\\" (meaning they shared the same boundaries). With the introduction of the County system of government in 1961, joint administration of municipalities and the school boards was initiated, and would continue until 1994. Olds School Division No. 39 would eventually evolve into the Chinook's Edge School Division, which continues to serve the county.

This capability balances is network sessions like Web, email, etc. over multiple connections in order to spread out the amount of bandwidth used by each LAN user, thus increasing the total amount of bandwidth available. For example, a user has a single WAN connection to the Internet operating at 1.5Mbit/s. They wish to add a second broadband (cable, DSL, wireless, etc.) connection operating at 2.5Mbit/s. This would provide them with a total of 4Mbit/s of bandwidth when balancing sessions. Session balancing does just that, it balances sessions across each WAN link. When Web browsers connect to the Internet, they commonly open multiple sessions, one for the text, another for an image, another for some other image, etc. These sessions can be balanced across the available connections. An FTP application only uses a single session so it is not balanced; however if a secondary FTP connection is made, then it may be balanced so that the traffic is distributed across two of the various connections and thus provides an overall increase in throughput. Additionally, network load balancing is commonly used to provide network redundancy so that in the event of a WAN link outage, access to network resources is still available via the secondary link(s). Redundancy is a key requirement for business continuity plans and generally used in conjunction with critical applications like VPNs and VoIP. Finally, most network load balancing systems also incorporate the ability to balance both outbound and inbound traffic. Inbound load balancing is generally performed via dynamic DNS which can either be built into the system, or provided by an external service or system. Having the dynamic DNS service within the system is generally thought to be better from a cost savings and overall control point of view.  Microsoft NLB  Microsoft has also purchased a technology that it renamed Network Load Balancing (NLB) that allows for efficient utilization of multiple network cards. MS NLB can be configured in unicast or in multicast modeTechNet Overview of NLB, visited 8 June 2013 where in multicast mode you can enable IGMP snooping. MS NLB was introduced for the first time in Windows NT server to spread traffic over multiple hosts without the need for a hardware based load balancer, e.g. when you host a busy web-server application where a single host wouldn't be able to manage all the traffic. And in more recent applications it would be used in Windows clusters for Hyper-V or Microsoft SQL Server = Unicast mode = In unicast mode MS NLB reassigns the stations MAC address (which applies to the clusters IP address) to a virtual MAC address and all NIC's in the NLB cluster use this same MAC address. This setup will cause all incoming traffic for the cluster to be flooded to all ports of the switch as unknown unicast frames:VMware knowledge base: MS NLB in unicast and multicast mode, visited 8 May 2013 even to hosts that are not joining in the cluster. To keep flooding minimal you would need to use a dedicated VLAN for the cluster. = Multicast mode = Another option is to make NLB in multicast mode. The unicast IPv4 address of the cluster is linked to a multicast MAC address. The hosts is in the cluster will never send traffic to the switch using this MAC address with the cluster IPv4 address so one would need to create a static ARP entry on the router (layer 3) in the attached network. Not all vendors will allow you to create an ARP entry where you use a unicast IP address and a multicast MAC address. Cisco publishes some examples how to set up MS NLB on Catalyst switches running IOSCisco: Catalyst configuration examples , visited 8 June 2013 and these same examples can be used for switches from many other vendors. As with NLB in unicast mode: incoming traffic towards the cluster will be flooded to all ports in the switch/VLAN and not all vendors support this setup. To limit the flooding, MS NLB now supports IGMP which should lead to the switches learning which ports are actually using the multicast address,Microsoft Support knowledge base: KB283028: IGMP Snooping support on NLB, visited 8 June 2013 but it doesn't always lead to the desired result. For example, Dell PowerConnect multi-layer switches officially don't support MS NLB in multicast. Even though it does work, it will lead to high CPU utilization - affecting (other) traffic in the switchDell Tech Communities:Trying to limit switch flooding from a Microsoft Windows Network Load Balacing (NLB), February 2012. Visited: 8 June 2013 and on other switches one might have other limitations such that the switch to which the NLB NICs are connected can't be the same switch that does the IP routing.  Server load balancing  When multiple servers are joined to create a cluster. Clusters can use network load balancing whereby simultaneous cluster request are distributed between cluster servers. Round-robin DNS records is one form of cluster load balancing. It works by creating multiple host records (usually A and/or AAAA) for one machine. As clients make requests, DNS rotates through its list of records. In addition to the before mentioned, to configure a terminal server cluster, one needs a load-balancing technology such as Network Load Balancing (NLB) or DNS round robin. A load balancing solution will distribute client connections to each of the terminal servers. Terminal Server Session Directory is a feature that allows users to easily and automatically reconnect to a disconnected session in a load balanced Terminal Server farm. The session directory keeps a list of sessions indexed by username and server name. This enables a user, after disconnecting a session, to reconnect to the correct Terminal Server where the disconnected session resides in order to resume working in that session. This reconnection will work even if the user connects from a different client computer.

Headgear is padded helmet worn during sparring in the martial arts. Boxing In June 2013 AIBA repealed mandatory headgear for amateur elite male boxers (19‚Äì40 years old) Headgear is a padded helmet, worn on the head by contestants in Amateur and Olympic boxing. It effectively protects against cuts, scrapes, and swelling, but it does not protect very well against concussions. It will not protect the brain from the jarring that occurs when the head is struck. Also, most boxers aim for the chin on opponents, and the chin is usually not protected by headgear. There are different types of boxing headgear available. Some headgear is open-faced. This is the style normally used in amateur boxing competitions. Unlike open-faced headgear, training headgear covers the cheek. \\"Face-saver\\" headgear features a pad across the face so that no direct contact is made to the face. As the amount of padding in headgear is increased, visibility is reduced. Boxing Headgear will reduce the impact of a hit by 40-60%. It has been lately noted that use of a headgear might in fact be less safe than not using it due to increased rate of brain damage, particularly outside professional boxing. Due to this, headguards were not used in the 2016 Summer Olympics. There are three theories for why use of headgear might lead to more brain damage: the headguard makes it more difficult to see, it makes ones head a bigger target and it might create a false sense of security, leading the boxer to take more risks than they otherwise might. As such, use of 16oz gloves has become more recommended to increase the safety of boxing, as they are heavy enough to prevent the boxer from throwing punches at full speed and power. https://www.wired.com/2016/08/olympic-boxers-arent-wearing- headgear-anymore/ https://shortboxing.com/boxing-sparring-brain-damage/ https://myboxingheadgear.com/ Wrestling Wrestling headgear is designed to protect the ears from damage. It features either soft or hard plastic ear covers and straps around the chin and back of the head. It is commonly used in grappling sports such as amateur wrestling, submission wrestling and Brazilian jiu-jitsu. Point fighting Point fighting headgear, which is commonly required in sport karate tournaments is made of a molded and dipped foam. This type of headgear is most common in no contact and semi contact fighting. It is designed to protect against accidental impact, including the head hitting the floor after a slip or knockdown. This sort of headgear can be open face, full faced and sometimes even a full plastic face shield.

Built in 1865 by 'Abdurrahman ibn Sulaiman under the Emirate of Jabal Shammar, The fortress played an integral role in the Unification of Saudi Arabia, with the Battle of Riyadh, one of the most important conflicts of the Saudi unification, taking place in the fort. Since 1995, the fortress has been converted into a museum showcasing one of the most important landmarks of Saudi heritage.  History  The fort was built in 1865 by Emir of Riyadh, 'Abdurrahman ibn Sulaiman under the reign of Mohammed al-Rasheed, the ruler of the Emirate of Jabal Shammar and head of the House of Rasheed, who had wrested control of the city from the local House of Saud, who later went into exile. It was built with four watchtowers and thick walls, with a foundation of stone blocks, lying in the center of Riyadh, in the old city, part of the modern Deira district. It is one of the only historic buildings that has survived in the kingdom. The building was situated in the commercial center of historic Riyadh. In January 1902, Emir 'Abdulaziz ibn Saud Al Saud, who was at the time living in exile in Kuwait, returned to Riyadh and led an ambush against the Masmak fortress, regaining it from the House of Rasheed in the Battle of Riyadh. The event, which restored Saudi control over Riyadh, is considered one of the most important in the completion of the Unification of Saudi Arabia. It was used as a munitions warehouse from 1902 to 1938 by King Abdulaziz before he moved his court to then newly built Murabba Palace. In 1979, the Municipality of Riyadh prepared a study for the restoration of the Masmak, following which a renovation of the fortress began. Their vision was realized in 1995 when the Ministry of Education and the Supreme Commission for the Development of Riyadh converted the building into a museum, making it an integral part of Saudi heritage. It was later incorporated into the King Abdulaziz Historical Centre, a series of restored buildings in Riyadh. Centennial celebrations were held in 1999. The museum includes displays several antique guns, costumes and agricultural artifacts.  Architecture  The Masmak can be divided into six distinct parts: the gate, the mosque, the majlis, the well, the towers and the courtyard. The Masmak Fortress in 2014 Gate The main gate of the palace is located in the western wall, measuring high and wide. It is thich and is made of palmwood. There is an opening on the center of the door, called al-Khokha, which is just big enough for one person to pass at a time, and is a defensive feature designed to allow people in and out without opening the door. Mosque The mosque is located to the left of the entrance. It is a large room supported by several columns with shelves in the walls for placing mushafs of the Quran. A mihrab can be found in the mosque, and there are holes in the walls to provide ventilation. Majlis It is located directly ahead of the entrance and is a room in the shape of a rectangle. On the wall facing the entrance and the southern wall, there are holes in the walls for ventilation and lighting, similar to those found in the mosque.258x258pxWell The well is located in the northeastern corner of the fortress. Watchtowers In each of the corners of the mosque are conical towers, each approximately high. The towers are accessed through staircases located inside them. The walls of the towers are especially thick, with a thickness of . Courtyard The courtyard is surrounded by rooms with columns connected to each other internally, and it has stairs on the eastern side leading to the first floor and roofs, and there are three residential units, the first served as the residence of the ruler, the second used as a bayt al-mal, and the third was allocated for the accommodation of guests.

It was released on their 1969 album 20/20 and produced by Carl Wilson. It is a waltz in the style of baroque pop. Brian originally wrote and produced the song for the band Redwood, which would later become known as Three Dog Night. PopMatters calls the song \\"a dream, right on down the line from Carl‚Äôs feathery lead vocal‚Äîand the way it contrasts with the up-and-down crunch of the waltz backdrop‚Äîto the sumptuously layered arrangement of the chorus to the immaculate production job to the unadorned coda (which is from the extended version).\\"  Recording  Brian Wilson originally planned to give the song (along with \\"Darlin'\\") to Redwood. The group began recording on October 12, 1967 while in the midst of sessions for the Beach Boys' Wild Honey (1967). Strings and horns overdubs were added on October 14 with drums and percussion on October 15. Danny Hutton recounted: After one vocal session, Brian exited the booth and called up his astrologer, who told him that he was on a \\"down cycle\\". Brian, who had an aversion to Los Angeles smog, fled the studio and returned the next day with an oxygen tank and mask, taking hits from the tank and sprinting in the alley behind the studio. According to Chuck Negron, due to the commercial failure of Smiley Smile and Brian's waning commitment to his band, \\"the other Beach Boys wanted Brian's immense songwriting and producing talents used strictly to enhance their own careers\\". Negron then noted that he would have done the same thing if in the Beach Boys' position.

It was performed publicly for the first time by Strayhorn and vocalist Kay Davis with the Duke Ellington Orchestra at Carnegie Hall on November 13, 1948. Background Billy Strayhorn The lyric describes the author's weariness of the night life after a failed romance, wasting time with \\"jazz and cocktails\\" at \\"come-what-may places\\" and in the company of girls with \\"sad and sullen gray faces/with distingu√© traces\\". Strayhorn was a teenager when he wrote most of the song, which was to become his signature composition (along with \\"Take the 'A' Train\\"). The song was written in the key of D-flat major. The melody is over relatively complex chord changes, compared with many jazz standards, with chromatic movement and modulations that evoke a dreamlike state and the dissolute spirit characteristic of the so-called lush life. Nat King Cole performed \\"Lush Life\\" in 1949, while trumpeter Harry James recorded it four times. In the 1950s it was performed by jazz vocalists Ella Fitzgerald, Carmen McRae, and Sarah Vaughan. John Coltrane recorded it twice. One was a 14-minute version in 1958 as the title track of an album for Prestige. The other was in 1963 with vocalist Johnny Hartman.
