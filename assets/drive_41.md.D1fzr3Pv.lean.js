The exchange of cash for cars has since become a corollary trade in the automotive industry to promote efforts on environmental protection and social responsibility. United States In the United States, the US Council for Automotive Research (USCAR) Vehicle Recycling Partnership (VRP) LLC sees to the proper management of end- of-life vehicles in the United States in particular, and the North American continent in general. In 1991, USCAR's VRP ‚Äì which includes DaimlerChrysler Corporation, Ford Motor Company, and General Motors Corporation ‚Äì began its intensive campaign to maximize vehicle recycling in the United States. Today, more than 95 per cent of all vehicles in the United States go through a market-driven recycling infrastructure, with no added cost or tax to customers. More than 75 per cent, by weight, of each end-of-life vehicle (ELV) is recycled. With American automakers taking a proactive stance in government and private industry efforts on vehicle recycling, the cash-for-cars trade has become more lucrative than ever. There are a number of internet-based companies that have evolved to handle the end-of-life vehicle market, advertising themselves as the \\"Fast, easy and convenient\\" final step in the automotive life cycle. The simple process is highly beneficial for the environment and even more beneficial to customers (sellers of ELV). In the cash-for-cars trade, the amount the junk car will pay varies greatly based on the year of the car but on average ranges between $150 to $500. In 1976, Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp. was argued before the Supreme Court of the United States. It was a result of the creation of a program in Maryland with regard to purchasing junked cars and paying a bounty to licensed scrap processors who had exchanged cash for cars bearing the State's license plates. The issue on the table was to determine whether such a program, which provided for imposing more stringent documentation requirements on out-of-state processors, Constitutionally discriminated against or burdened interstate commerce on car dealerships exchanging cash for cars that had been rendered unserviceable. The case effectively favored the State. Canada In early 2009, a voluntary program, called Retire Your Ride, was launched by the Government of Canada to encourage motorists across the country to give up their old vehicles that emit pollutants. A total of 50,000 vehicles manufactured in 1995 or in years prior were targeted for permanent retirement. In cooperation with the Clean Air Foundation and community stakeholders, the program created cash-for-cars incentives for vehicles traded and put up for recycling. When the Retire Your Ride campaign ended in March 2011, over 130,000 vehicles have been retired under the program. United Kingdom Between 2009‚Äì10, the United Kingdom introduced the scrappage incentive scheme that paid GBP2,000 in cash for cars registered on or before 31 August 1999. The high payout was to help old-vehicle owners purchase new and less-polluting ones. In the United Kingdom the term cash for cars also relates to the purchase of cars immediately for cash from car buying companies without the need of advertising. There are however legal restrictions to level of cash that can used within a business transaction to buy a vehicle. The EU sets this at 10,000 euros or currency equivalent as part of its Money Laundering Regulations. In the UK it is no longer possible to purchase scrap cars for cash with the introduction of the Scrap Metal Dealers Act in 2013. As a result, firms in the scrap my car industry can no longer pay cash for cars. Instead, these firms now pay by bank transfer. European Union Within the European Union, the EU Commission operates on the End of Life Vehicles Directive, which is geared towards the reduction of waste arising from ELVs. Players in the automotive industry have also gotten to paying cash for cars and all other ELVs, as a waste minimization scheme with multilateral benefits. Australia In Australia, the term cash for cars is also synonymous with car removal. Only in Victoria, companies must acquire a LMCT and other relevant processing licenses before the procurement of vehicles. Some time it takes to check every vehicles history and After that It can be processed for wrecking and recycling purposes. Both Cash For Cars and Car Removals services are asked for cars coming to the end of their road life. New Zealand New Zealand motor vehicle fleet increased 61 percent from 1.5 million in 1986 to over 2.4 million by June 2003. By 2015 it almost reached 3.9 million. This is where scrapping has increased since 2014. Cash For Cars is a term used for Car Removal/Scrap Car where wreckers pay cash for old/wrecked/broken vehicles depending on age/model.

State of Karnataka, a 1989 Supreme Court of India case, occurred when the Government of Karnataka issued a notification that permitted the private medical colleges in the State of Karnataka to charge exorbitant tuition fees from the students admitted other than the \\"Government seat quota\\". Miss Mohini Jain, a medical aspirant student filed a petition in Supreme Court challenging this notification. The apex Court raised an important question that \\"whether right to education is guaranteed to the Indian citizen under the Constitution of India?\\" The Supreme Court of India observed that mention of \\"life and personal liberty\\" in Article 21 of the Constitution[Constitution Of India. Available on Official Website of Ministry of Law and Justice, Government of India.http://lawmin.nic.in/coi/coiason29july08.pdf.] automatically implies some other rights, those are necessary for the full development of the personality, though they are not enumerated in Part III of the Constitution. Education is one such factor responsible for overall development of an individual and therefore, right to education is integrated in Article 21 of the Constitution.  A brief on the Case  Mohini jain a resident of Meerut (in the State of UP), applied for admission to the MBBS course in the session commencing February/March, 1991, to a private medical college located in the State of Karnataka. The college management asked her to deposit a sum of Rs. 60,000/- as the tuition fee for the first year and also to show a bank guarantee of the amount equal to the fee for the remaining years. When Miss Jain's father intimated the management that the asked amount was beyond his reach, the management denied Ms. Jain's admission to the medical college. Miss Jain informed the court that the management demanded an additional amount of Rs. four and a half lakhs, however, the management denied the allegation (?).[Official Website of Supreme Court of India. Available online at http://www.supremecourtofindia.nic.in] As per the notification, the denial of admission of Miss Jain due to her failure to submit the yearly tuition fee of Rs. 60,000/- was a valid step taken by the college management. In this situation, Miss Jain filed a petition (Writ petition (Civil) No. 456 of 1991) under Article 32 (1) (\\"The right to move the Supreme Court by appropriate proceedings for the enforcement of the rights conferred by this Part (Part III: Fundamental Rights) is guaranteed\\") of the Constitution of India challenging the notification issued by the Government of Karnataka. A two- member bench consisting Justice Kuldip Singh and Justice R. M. Sahai gave the judgment of the case on 30 July 1992 (1992 AIR 1858). For the first time in the post independent India, right to education of the Indian citizens and the State obligation to secure the right came under scrutiny at the premises of the apex court. It is important to note that this was the time when neo- liberal economic policy were knocking at the door of India.  The notification  It is relevant to know in this context that what was the notification issued by the Government of Karnataka. The Government of Karnataka issued a notification dated 5 June 1989 under section 5(1) of the Karnataka Educational Institutions (Prohibition of capitation fee) Act, 1984, which fixed the tuition and other fees to be charged from the students by the private medical colleges in the state. As per the notification, the tuition fee for the candidates admitted against: 1\\\\. \\"Government seat\\" was Rs. 2,000 per year, 2\\\\. For the students from Karnataka but not falling under \\"Government seat\\" was not to be exceeding Rs. 25,000/- per year, and 3\\\\. For the Indian students not residing in Karnataka was not to be exceeding Rs. 60,000/- per year.  Responses from the respondents  First respondent was the State of Karnataka. The second (the intervener) and the third respondent were the Karnataka Private Medical Colleges Association and the private medical college respectively. According to the third respondent, the private medical college, those students who were admitted under \\"Government seat quota\\" were meritorious and those who were admitted under the \\"Management quota\\" (other than \\"Government seat\\") were not meritorious; the classification was valid and hence, in such situation, the college-management had the right to charge more fee from non-meritorious students to meet the expenses in order to provide medical education to the students. According to the intervener, Karnataka Private Medical Colleges Association, the private medical colleges in the state of Karnataka received no financial aid either from the State or Central Government. The expenditure per student for 5-year MBBS course in private medical colleges was about 5 lakhs and forty percent of the seats were filled by the \\"Government Quota\\" under which students paid only Rs. 2,000/- per year, therefore, students admitted under \\"Management quota\\" had to share the burden. Hence, the tuition fee was not excessive and there was no question of profit making by the private medical colleges in the State of Karnataka. Moreover, both the intervener and the third respondent mentioned that there were no provision either in the constitution of India or under any other law which prevented the charging of capitation fee.  Issues before the Court  In the lieu of above situation several crucial questions appeared before the court. Now, the court had to answer the following major questions: a) Was there a 'right to education' guaranteed to the people of India under the Constitution? b) If the right is guaranteed to the people then, does applying capitation fee violate the guaranteed right to education? c) Whether charging capitation fee in educational institutions is arbitrary, unjust, unfair and violated Article 14 (\\"The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India\\" ) of the constitution?  Responses from the Court  The court said that the dignity of human can not be violated under any situation and it is the responsibility of the state to respect and protect the dignity of her citizens. An individual cannot be assured human dignity unless his/her personality is developed and the only way to do that is to educate the individual. When the Constitution was framed (the Constitution was adopted in 1950), 70 percent of the citizens of the country were illiterate. The framers of the constitution hoped to achieve 100 percent literacy within a time period of 10 years. Guided by this hope, Article 41 (\\"The State shall, within the limits of its economic capacity and development, make effective provision for securing the right to work, to education and to public assistance in cases of unemployment, old age, sickness and disablement, and in other cases of underserved want\\") and Article 45 (\\"The State shall endeavour to provide, within a period of ten years from the commencement of this Constitution, for free and compulsory education for all children until they complete the age of fourteen years\\") were included in the Chapter IV of the constitution. The court referred to the various provisions in the Constitution of India and reminded that the 'Preamble' has promised to secure to all citizens of India \\"Justice, social, economic and political\\", \\"Liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith, and worship\\". It further provided \\"Equality of status and of opportunity\\" and assured dignity of the individual. The objectives flowing from the 'Preamble' cannot be achieved and shall remain on paper unless the people in this country were educated. The Court said that although 'right to education' had not been guaranteed as a fundamental right under Part III of the constitution, the Articles 21 (in Part III of the Constitution of India), Article 38, 39(a), (f), 41 and 45 (in Part IV of the Constitution of India) together makes it clear that the framers of the constitution made it obligatory for the State to provide education for its citizens. Article 21 says \\"No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law\\". The right to life under Article 21 and the dignity of an individual cannot be assured unless it is accompanied by right to education. Therefore, every citizen had a 'right to education' under the constitution and thus, the state had an obligation to provide educational institutions at all levels for the benefit of all the citizens. All educational institutions whether it was state owned or state recognized were obliged to secure the 'right to education'. In Part IV, the directive principles of the state policy, the Constitution asks the State to secure social order and minimize inequalities for the promotion of welfare of citizens (Article 38). Article 39 of Part IV talks about directing the state policies to secure adequate means of livelihood of citizen and offer opportunities to children to facilitate their healthy al-round development. Reality of the fundamental rights under chapter III will not be realized by illiterate citizens unless \\"right to education\\" under Article 41 was ensured to the individual citizen. Therefore, \\"right to education\\" was concomitant to the fundamental rights provided under Part III of the constitution. The fundamental rights guaranteed under Part III of the constitution of India including the right to freedom of speech and expression and other rights under Article 19 cannot be appreciated and fully enjoyed unless a citizen is educated and is conscious of his individual dignity. Education is instrumental to reduce the inequality, and ensuring adequate livelihood. Illiterate people is vulnerable to exploitation. Without education the vision expressed in the said articles of the Constitution can not be realized. The court said that the \\"Directive Principles\\", which were fundamental in the governance of the country, cannot be isolated from the fundamental rights guaranteed under Part III. They were supplementary to each other and have to be read into the fundamental rights.  Court's responses on charging capitation fee  Charging capitation fee limits the access to the education only to the richer section of the people. Poorer person with better merit can not get admission due to inability to pay money and as a consequence in educational institution a citizen's \\"right to education\\" gets denied. Further, allowing charging capitation fee violates Article 14 of the constitution of India. The only method of admission to the medical colleges should be by merit and merit alone. The court further stated that the capitation fee was simply a price for selling education. The concept of \\"teaching shops\\" was not at par with the constitutional scheme and was entirely opposing character to the Indian culture and heritage. Court made one significant remark in stating that if government recognises or approve a professional institution to run a professional course, it is State responsibility to ensure that the Institute should charge the government rates only and right to education is preserved.  Significance of the Case  The judgment is historic in its own accord. The judgment of the Supreme Court has huge significance in a context of state's failure to maintain the endeavor set by article 45 of the Constitution even after 73 years of independence.[Tilak, J. B. (1998). Available online athttp://www.doccentre.org/docsweb/Education/Scanned_material/New- Folder/fre2.seminar98.646.pdf accessed on 11 September 2011.] However, the judgment of the court resulted mixed reaction. While, some critic the court's judgment as impractical and court's role as unnecessarily proactive,[Sathe, S. P. (1992). Supreme Court on Right to Education . Economic and Political Weekly; 27 (35); 1847‚Äì1848.] others welcomed the court's decision as logical[Nagasaila, D and Suresh, V (1992). Can Right to Education be a Fundamental Right? Economic and Political Weekly; 27 (45); 2442‚Äì2443.] and response to the call of hour.[Anand, A. S. (1997). Justice N.D. Krishna Rao Memorial Lecture Protection of Human Rights ‚Äî Judicial Obligation or Judicial Activism. Online available athttp://www.ebc- india.com/lawyer/articles/97v7a2.htm accessed on 10 September 2011.] Others noted the judgment as the expression of judicial activism due to the fact that only a two judge bench made a substantial change in constitution.[Suchindran, B. N. (2011). An injudicious fraud. Blog post available athttp://lawandotherthings.blogspot.com/2011/02/injudicious-fraud.html accessed on 11 September 2011.] Mohini Jain judgment of the Supreme Court was appeared at a time when liberalisation as a government policy was searching Indian soil to sprout. Commercialisation of education was not as rampant as it is now.[Times on India. available onlinehttp://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-02-21/india/28130476_1_capitation- fee-private-schools-education accessed on 10 March 2010.] In the recent trend of liberalization and privatization, the scourge of commercialization of education looms large. It is a challenge to keep the conformity with the socialist structure of Constitution and the judgment is in the line of retaining the conformity. The most notable part of the judgment was its insistence that the right to education be read as an integral part of the right to life guaranteed under Article 21, Part III. The decision of the Court that the fulfillment of the right to life requires a life of dignity and therefore, must be interpreted to include both the economic and social rights. Education is as basic as to ensure rights to food, water, and health. But, question arise whether right to education at all level is essential for citizens for living a descent life? Whether right to education should be limited to only right to primary and basic education? Whether, declaring right to education at higher education level actually increase status quo and unequal distribution of resources results in collapsing the entire education system in India?[Sathe, S. P. (1992). Supreme Court on Right to Education. Economic and Political Weekly; 27 (35); 1847‚Äì1848.] According to some critic, the private educational institutions do not get any government grants and therefore should not be interpreted under the purview of article 12 of the Constitution of India. Later Supreme court had to modify its judgment and limits the right to free and compulsory education up to 14 years of age.  Conclusion  The most important thing is, there was a traditional look towards Directive Principle as idealistic preaching of the constitution.[Times on India. available online at http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Schools-cant-be-allowed-to-fix- exorbitant-fees/articleshow/5600370.cms accessed on 10 March 2010.] This case, revisited the traditional ritualistic approach towards Directive Principles and provides a solid base of pragmatism. The 86th Amendment of the Constitution, passed by Parliament in 2002, and which came into force on 1 April 2010, the same date as its enabling legislation (Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009), made the Right to Education a Fundamental Right.

The early years of his reign saw an invasion from the Ghaznavid ruler Mahmud, who sacked the Somnath temple. Bhima left his capital and took shelter in Kanthkot during this invasion, but after Mahmud's departure, he recovered his power and retained his ancestral territories. He crushed a rebellion by his vassals at Arbuda, and unsuccessfully tried to invade the Naddula Chahamana kingdom. Towards the end of his reign, he formed an alliance with the Kalachuri king Lakshmi-Karna, and played an important role in the downfall of the Paramara king Bhoja. The earliest of the Dilwara Temples and the Modhera Sun Temple were built during Bhima's reign. The construction of Rani ki vav is attributed to his queen Udayamati.  Early life  Bhima's father Nagaraja was a son of the Chaulukya king Chamunda-raja. Chamunda was succeeded by Nagaraja's brothers, Vallabha- raja and Durlabha-raja, in that order. Both Vallabha and Durlabha died childless. According to the 12th century author Hemachandra, Durlabha was very fond of his nephew Bhima, and appointed Bhima as his successor before his death. Durlabha and Nagaraja died soon after Bhima's ascension to throne.  Military career  = Ghaznavid invasion = Ruins of the Somnath temple in 1869 Early during his reign, Bhima faced an invasion by Mahmud of Ghazni, whose plunder of the Somnath temple has been described in detail by the medieval Muslim historians. According to Ali ibn al-Athir, Mahmud started out from Ghazni on 18 October 1025. At Multan, he planned his march in detail and gathered supplies. He left Multan on 26 November, with a large army well- equipped to cross the Thar desert, and reached the Chaulukya capital in December 1025 CE. According to the Muslim accounts, Bhima fled his capital Anahilapataka (called Nahrwala by the medieval Muslim historians). He took shelter in Kanthkot, allowing Mahmud to enter the Chaulukya capital unopposed. Mahmud's sudden invasion, coupled with the lack of any fortifications in Anahilapataka, may have forced Bhima to abandon his capital. Other residents of the city also appear to have evacuated it, as the Muslim historians do not mention any massacre or looting in the Chaulukya capital. Mahmud rested at Anahilapataka for a few days, replenished his supplies, and then left for Somnath. A relatively small force of 20,000 soldiers unsuccessfully tried to check Mahmud's advance at Modhera. Historian A. K. Majumdar theorizes that the Modhera Sun Temple, might have been built to commemorate this defence. The upside down inscription in the cella of the temple proper evidences the destruction and reconstruction probably shortly after 1026 CE. Sun Temple, Modhera was constructed around a year after Mahmud's invasion Mahmud then advanced to Delvada. Although the town surrendered without offering any resistance, Mahmud massacred all its residents. Finally, Mahmud's army reached Somnath on 6 January 1026 CE. The Muslim historians suggest that the town was well-defended, probably by a fort guarding the temple. According to Abu Sa'id Gardezi, the commander of the defending force fled to a nearby island. Other defenders put up a resistance, but Mahmud managed to capture the fort by 8 January. Mahmud then desecrated the temple, and looted a huge amount of wealth including jewels and silver idols. During his return journey, Mahmud came to know that a powerful Hindu king named Param Dev had gathered a large army to fight him. Gardezi, in his Kitab Zainu'l-Akhbar (c. 1048 CE), states that Mahmud chose to avoid any confrontation with this king. The invader was carrying back a large amount of looted wealth, which may have motivated him to avoid a battle. Mahmud decided to return via Mansura in Sindh, although the route connecting Gujarat and Sindh was more dangerous than the desert route to Multan. Later Muslim historians also mention this incident. The 16th century historian Firishta identified Param Dev with Bhima I, calling him the king of Nahrwala. Historian A. K. Majumdar agrees with this identification, arguing that \\"Param\\" might be a Muslim mistranscription of \\"Bhima\\". Scholars who are critical of this theory identify Param dev with the Paramara king Bhoja, who ruled the neighbnouring territory of Malwa. K. N. Seth and Mahesh Singh point out that Bhima had ascended the throne recently, and was not a powerful ruler at the time of Mahmud's raid. In fact, as attested by the Muslim historians, he had fled his capital and hid in Kanthkot. The Muslim historians before Firishta, such as Gardezi and Nizamuddin Ahmad, mention the king of Nahrwala and Param Dev as two distinct kings. Unlike Bhima, Bhoja was a powerful and famous ruler at that time. Bhoja was also a Shaivite, and according to the Udaipur Prashasti, had constructed a temple dedicated to Somnath (an aspect of Shiva). Thus Mahmud's desecration of the Somnath temple in Gujarat would have motivated Bhoja to lead an army against him. Based on these evidences, several scholars identify Param Dev with Bhoja. \\"Param Dev\\" is probably a corruption of \\"Paramara-Deva\\" or of Bhoja's titles Paramabhattakara-Parameshvara. = Invasion of Sindh = According to the 12th century scholar Hemachandra, who was patronized by the Chaulukyas, Bhima defeated Hammuka, a ruler of Sindh. This claim has also been repeated by the 14th century chronicler Merutunga. Hemachandra's account of Bhima's war against Sindh goes like this: one day Bhima's spies told him that the kings of Andhra, Pundra and Magadha obeyed him. On the other hand, Hammuka (the king of Sindhu, that is, Sindh) and Karna (the king of Chedi) not only refused to acknowledge his supremacy, but also defamed him. Bhima then marched to Sindh, bridging and crossing the Indus river in the process. He defeated Hammuka, who was forced to acknowledge his supremacy. Later, he also defeated Karna. According to the epic Mahabharata, the legendary hero Bhima defeated two other warriors: Jayadratha (the king of Sindhu Kingdom) and Karna. Hemachandra's poetic account compares Bhima I to his legendary namesake, because the Chaulukya king had also defeated the king of Sindhu and Karna (the king of Chedi). There is no epigraphic evidence of Bhima having defeated the king of Sindh. In absence of any corroborating evidence, the historical accuracy of this account is uncertain. Historian A. K. Majumdar theorizes that Hammuka might have been a descendant of the Saindhava dynasty, which probably originated from Sindh. This dynasty is known to have last ruled western Saurashtra in 915 CE. Like Hammuka, the names of its rulers ended in -ka: Ranaka, Jaika and Agguka. = Paramaras of Arbuda = Vimal Vasahi Temple, Mount Abu The Paramara branch of Arbuda had been feudatories of the Chaulukyas since Mularaja's reign. However, sometime before 1031 CE, the Abu Paramara ruler Dhandhuka rebelled against Bhima. Bhima defeated him, and appointed Vimala as the new dandapati (governor) of Arbuda. Vimala commissioned the shrine of Adinatha at Mount Abu in 1031 CE, so Dhandhuka's rebellion must have happened before this year. Dhandhuka took shelter with Bhoja, the Paramara king of Malwa. According to Jinaprabha Suri's Tirtha Kalpa, Bhima later restored Dhandhuka as his vassal. A 1042 CE inscription of Dhandhuka's son Purnapala states that he was ruling over Arbuda-mandala as a Maharajadhiraja (\\"king of great kings\\"), after having defeated his enemy. This suggests that the Paramaras of Arbuda may have again rebelled against Bhima's authority. However, the area was back under Bhima's control by 1062 CE, as attested by an inscription of Vimala. = Paramaras of Bhinmal = Bhima defeated and imprisoned Krishna-deva, a ruler of the Paramara branch of Bhinmal. However, the Naddula Chahamanas defeated Bhima, and freed Krishna-deva. This is attested by the Sundha Hill inscription of the Chahamanas. Subsequently, Krishna-deva ruled independent of Bhima; his inscriptions describe him as a Maharajadhiraja. = Chahamanas of Naddula = The Chahamanas of Naddula ruled the territory to the north of the Chaulukya kingdom. According to their Sundha Hill inscription, the Chahamana king Ahila defeated Bhima. Ahila probably repulsed an invasion from Bhima. The Sundha Hill inscription as well as another Chahamana inscription state that the later king Anahilla also defeated the elephant force of Bhima. Anahilla is also said to have destroyed Bhima's army and captured a large part of his territory. His sons Balaprasada and Jendraraja also took part in the war against Bhima. Balaprasada forced Bhima to release Krishna-deva (the Paramara ruler of Bhimal) from the prison. Jendraraja defeated Bhima's force at Shanderaka (modern Sanderao). The location of the battles suggests that Bhima was the aggressor in this war, and the Chahamanas repulsed his invasion. The war continued during the reign of Bhima's successor Karna. = Paramaras of Malwa = Bhima formed an alliance with the Kalachuri king Lakshmi-Karna, and played a significant role in the downfall of Bhoja, the Paramara dynasty of Malwa. This achievement has been recorded by several Chaulukya chroniclers and inscriptions. The most detailed account of the rivalry between Bhima and Bhoja is given by the 14th century chronicler Merutunga. However, it is hard to separate the historical truth from fiction in Merutunga's legendary account, which goes like this: Bhima and Bhoja were initially friends, but Bhoja made a plan to invade Gujarat. When Bhima's spy informed him about Bhoja's plan, Bhima sent his ambassador Damara to Bhoja's court. Damara instigated Bhoja to attack the Chalukyas of Kalyani, who had killed the earlier Paramara ruler Munja. Thus, Damara managed to divert Bhoja's attention away from Bhima's kingdom. While Bhoja was facing a war with the Kalyani Chalukyas, Damara lied to him that Bhima had also started a march against him. This worried Bhoja, who begged Damara to convince Bhima to abandon his march towards Malwa. Damara agreed to do so if Bhoja gifted Bhima an elephant couple, which Bhoja did. Merutunga further states that while Bhima was engaged in a war against the king of Sindh, Bhoja's digambara general Kulachandra sacked the Chaulukya capital Anahilapataka. Subsequently, Merutunga mentions several incidents that suggest that the two kings maintained diplomatic ties. One day, while Bhoja was worshipping his family deity at a temple on the outskirts of his capital Dhara, the goddess warned him that he was surrounded by enemy soldiers. Bhoja was nearly killed by the Gujarati soldiers Aluya and Koluya, but managed to escape. Merutunga finally describes Bhoja's death as follows: One day, the Kalachuri king Karna challenged Bhoja to a war or a temple-building contest. Bhoja chose the second option, and lost the contest to Karna. However, Bhoja refused to acknowledge Karna's supremacy. As a result, Karna invaded Malwa from the east, supported by 136 vassals. He also asked Bhima to invade Malwa from the east. Bhoja died of a disease, as these two kings invaded his kingdom. After his death, Karna captured his capital and all his wealth. According to Merutunga, it was Karna who captured Dhara after Bhoja's death. Other Chaulukya chroniclers claim that Bhima captured Dhara. It is possible that Bhima raided Dhara at a later date. One particular chronicle Kirti- Kaumudi claims that Bhima captured Bhoja, but generously released him and spared his life. This is not corroborated by historical evidence. = Kalachuris of Tripuri = Bhima and the Kalachuri king Lakshmi-Karna remained allies until Bhoja's death. Subsequently, there seems to have been a dispute between them over sharing the spoils of their victory. The Chaulukya chroniclers claim that Bhima subdued Karna easily, but such claims are of little historical value. The 12th century writer Hemachandra claims that Bhima sent his ambassador Damodara to Karna, demanding his share of the Paramara assets. Damodara's description of Bhima's power scared Karna, who started praising Bhima and gifted him Bhoja's golden throne. The 14th century chronicler Merutunga claims that Bhima demanded half of Bhoja's kingdom from Karna. When Karna refused, Bhima's ambassador Damara entered Karna's palace with 32 foot soldiers and abducted Karna as the Kalachuri king slept. Karna ultimately made peace by surrendering a golden shrine to Bhima. These accounts by the Chaulukya chroniclers appear to be historically inaccurate, as Karna was too powerful to be subdued by an ambassador of Bhima. Hemachandra does not mention Bhima's conflict with Bhoja at all, and Bhima's allies named by him in the struggle against Karna are all fictitious. Merutunga's account seems to be derived partly from Hemachandra's Dvyashraya and partly from Kirti-Kaumudi. That said, there is some historical evidence of a conflict between Bhima and Karna. Karna's Rewa stone inscription claims that when he approached the Gurjara country (that is, Bhima's kingdom of Gujarat), the Gurjara women shed tears and became widows. It is possible that Bhima gained some advantage over Karna, after the Kalachuris were decisively defeated by the Kalyani Chalukya king Someshvara I.  Personal life  Popular tradition attributes the construction of Rani ki vav to Bhima's queen Udayamati Bhima's queen was Udayamati. According to Hemachandra, he had three sons: Mularaja, Kshemaraja, and Karna. Mularaja died during Bhima's lifetime, and Kshemaraja rejected the throne. As a result, Karna succeeded Bhima. Merutunga, on the other hand, states that Bhima's three sons were Mularaja, Karna and Haripala. Of these, Haripala was born of a courtesan named Bakuladevi. Historian A. K. Majumdar theorizes that Merutunga's account appears to be more accurate, since voluntary rejections of thrones were very rare. Hemachandra, who was a royal courtier, probably wanted to avoid mentioning the illegitimate son Haripala, and therefore, glossed over the genealogy. =Temples and constructions= File:Kumbhariya Jain temple, Banaskantha.jpgIntrinsic carvings inside Kumbharia Mahavira temple File:Ancient shrines of sander,Patan District.jpgShiva temple near Sanderi Mata temple File:Ancient shrines,sander,Dist.

He also built Bhimeshwara and Bhattarika Bhiruani temples. He rebuilt Somnath Temple after its destruction by Ghazni. Merutunga credits Udayamati with excavating a reservoir at Anahilapataka; this tank is said to have been better than the Sahastralinga Tank in the town. According to popular tradition, she also commissioned the Rani ki vav (Queen's stepwell). His minister and later governor of Chandravati, Vimala built Adinath Jain temple, one of the Dilwara Temples, on Mount Abu during the last years of Bhima's reign. He had also built one more temple at Patan and Vimala Vasahi on Shatrunjaya (renovated in 17th century). The Modhera Sun Temple (1026-27 CE) except its Rangamandapa and tank was reconstructed during Bhima's reign. Bhaktamarastrotra Vritti (1370 CE) and Ratnamandira's Upadeshatarangini (c. 15th century) mentions the construction of Adinatha and Parshwanatha temples by Shreshthi Jhinah at Dhavalakka (Dholka) during this period. Vagheshwari/Khambhalai Mata temple at Dhinoj in Patan district was built during the same period as Modhera Sun temple. Achaleshwara Mahadev and Jagannatha temples on Mount Abu were contemporary of Adinath temple. Limboji Mata temple at Delmal in north Gujarat is also of the same period. The small shrine of Someshwara at Gorad near Mehsana; Shiva temple and Sanderi Mata temple at Sander in Patan district belongs to 11th century. A ruined shrine in Mulamadhavpura in Saurashtra is contemporary of Shiva temple at Sander. Pankhnath Mahadev and the early surviving parts of Ambika temples at Khedbrahma are also of this period. The large marble temple of Mahavira (1062 CE), of five Jain temples at Kumbhariya, is the last major temple of this period. The vase-and-foliage pillars and lintels of a temple of this period at Patan is reused in the inlet sluice chamber of Khan Sarovar. The Tanka Mosque in Dholka has four decorated bhadraka pillars reused from a small shrine of this age. The badly renovated Sun temple and another temple dedicated to Daityasudana Vishnu at Prabhas Patan also belongs to this period. Ankol Mata stepwell at Davad and Mata Bhavani's Stepwell in Ahmedabad belonged to the third quarter of the 11th century.

The types of nerve activity targeted in preventive analgesia include pre-surgery pain, all pain-system activity caused during surgery, and pain produced post-surgery by damage and inflammation. A person's assessment of pain intensity from standard experimental stimuli prior to surgery is correlated with the intensity of their post-surgery pain. Pain intensity immediately post-surgery is correlated with pain intensity on release from hospital, and correlated with the likelihood of experiencing chronic post- surgery pain.

In 2001, during his studies at the Charles University in Prague, he became an economic advisor to President V√°clav Havel. He was 24. He later commented in the Hospod√°≈ôsk√© noviny newspaper: \\"[The Dean of our faculty] phoned me that Mr. Fischer's office needs an economic analyst. I thought that Mr. Fischer is the owner of the same-name travel agency,V√°clav Fischer, Czech entrepreneur and politician, at that time the owner of the travel agency Fischer Reisen. and I almost refused. I wanted to devote myself to science. But the Dean then patiently explained to me that the president should not be refused. At that moment I realized that the person who contacted him was Pavel Fischer, Chief of the Political Department of the Office of the President.\\" (\\"Zatelefonoval mi, ≈æe pan Fischer pot≈ôebuje do kancel√°≈ôe ekonomick√©ho analytika.

From November 2001 to February 2003, Sedl√°ƒçek worked for the Czech President. In January, 2004, he was engaged as an advisor to the former Minister of Finance Bohuslav Sobotka. However, he left the position in 2006, according to his own words \\"due to excessive politicization of the work at the Ministry\\". In 2006, during his scholarship at Yale University, Sedl√°ƒçek was listed as one of the \\"Young Guns: 5 Hot Minds in Economics\\" in the Yale Economic Review. Following his return from the United States, he was engaged as Chief Macroeconomic Strategist at the ƒåeskoslovensk√° obchodn√≠ banka (ƒåSOB). As of 2011, he still holds the position at the bank.

The book became a bestseller in the Czech Republic. In his book, Sedl√°ƒçek refuses the one-sided view of economics as a value-free mathematical inquiry. He describes economics as a cultural phenomenon and a product of our civilization closely tied with philosophy, myth, religion, anthropology, and the arts. According to Sedl√°ƒçek, economics should not concern only abstract mathematical modelling, but also societies' values. The broad concept of the book covers the history of economics through the millennia, \\"from the epic of Gilgamesh and the Old Testament to the emergence of Christianity, from Descartes and Adam Smith to Fight Club and The Matrix.\\" Additionally, the book explores some of the fundamental and provocative questions of the present time: \\"Is growth the only answer? Are we addicted to desire? Does it pay to be good?\\" In 2009, the book received the Wald Press Award. In 2012, the book won the \\"Deutscher Wirtschaftsbuchpreis\\" (2012 Frankfurt Book Fair Award) for the best economic title in Germany. The work was praised by the economics professor Deirdre McCloskey.

He served in the Parliamentary army in the English Civil War. Biography James was the son of John James of Astley, Worcestershire and his wife Mary Winford, daughter of Walter Winford. He became a supporter of the Parliamentary cause and served in the army. On 19 April 1647, the Committee of both Kingdoms ordered that '\\"Capt. James shall have power to seize upon and recruit his troop out of such horses as are the State's, marked with the State's mark, and have been embezled and sold away to any persons in cos. Bucks, Berks, and Oxon.\\" He was added to the Committee for Sequestrations in Worcestershire on 29 July 1648, and was appointed a sequestration commissioner for the county on 4 September 1649 and on 7 February 1650. In December 1650 he was High Sheriff of Herefordshire. The Committee for Compounding wrote to him on 26 December 1650, \\" Knowing how much you may contribute to carry on sequestration work, we have joined Mr. Herring (MP for Herefordshire) with you therein, and beg you both to use the utmost care to manage it to the best advantage. We have heard so much of your prudence and readiness that we believe you will omit nothing, and therefore will not trouble you further.\\" He replied on 10 January 1651 \\"Thanks for your remembrance of me and my cousin Salway (his colleague). I am sorry I cannot answer your expectations in regard of other public business, but I shall spare as much time as I can for your business\\" and he was eventually discharged from the committee for sequestration for unsatisfactory accounts in or about March 1652 He was appointed captain of a Troop of Horse Militia in Herefordshire on 21 August 1650. As Colonel James, he was appointed commander of the Horse and Dragoons in Worcestershire, under a commission from the Council of State on 31 March 1651 to \\" raise and command the forces in co. Worcester, under the Militia Act,\\" and he received a further order on 30 June for \\"listing volunteers in co. Worcs.\\" On 7 October 1651 the Council wrote to him at Worcester \\"The Council have ordered Col. Cooper to search for some gold said to be hid in Worcester, belonging to the enemy; the money is found, and 150 pieces of old gold are now in your hands; send it up to us to be disposed of as the Council shall direct.\\" The Council wrote him on 31 March 1651 \\"Being informed of your fitness to command the horse and dragoons raised in co. Worcs, we have issued a commission for that purpose, which we enclose, and desire you to give your best furtherance and assistance in raising of them that they may be ready on all occasions for preservation of the peace.\\" He received a commission as captain in the 1st Horse Regiment for the safety of the Eastern Association and Inland parts on 21 April 1651, and as these measures were taken to repel the Scots army under Charles II, he probably took part in the Battle of Worcester. He was added by order of Parliament to the High Court of Justice on 25 June 1651.W R Williams The Parliamentary History of the County of Worcester In 1653, James was nominated as Member of Parliament for Worcestershire for the Barebones Parliament. The Council of State ordered on 15 June 1653, that Col. John James and other MPs \\"should have the lodgings late in possession of Sir Henry Vane, Sir H. Mildmay, and Col. Thomson, and any others they think fit, so that they may be lodged together,\\" and further ordered on 8 July, \\"that the Whitehall Committee should put them in possession of the house late Dennis Bond's.\\" On 1 November 1653, he was appointed a member of the seventh Council of State, which lasted till December 1653, and took the oath of secrecy on 5 November. He was appointed one of the Ordnance Committee and also of the Committee for Lunatics on 8 November, and was added to the Irish and Scotch Committee on 28 November 1653. In 1654, James got into a dispute with Charles Rich which appeared to be leading to a duel. On 25 April 1654, the Lord Protector's Council reported. \\"The Lord President having last Saturday issued a warrant to take into custody Charles Rich and John James on information of a quarrel between them, both parties appeared before the Council where both were bound in ¬£1,000 and two sureties in ¬£1,000 not to fight each other, nor break the public peace\\". On 8 May \\"a warrant to be prepared for commitment of both to the Tower, they not having attended to give security.\\" On 10 May, \\"two warrants signed but suspended till Jessop (Assistant Clerk of the Council) give notice to Rich in the country\\". On 19 May, \\"Order that they both give security in ¬£1,000 each with two sufficient sureties to keep the peace towards each other for all times to come and neither of them to break it, and on so doing that their warrant for commitment to the Tower be suspended.\\" James was a commissioner for ejecting scandalous and insufficient ministers and schoolmasters in August 1654, and a commissioner to raise ¬£1,000 Assessment upon the county in 1656. James appear to have been brought to trial at the Restoration and was probably pardoned. On 1 September 1670 he was given licence as John James, of Tripleton, \\"to remain in and about London and Westminster, although an officer in the army of the late usurped powers.\\" James married Jane Higgins, daughter of William Higgins, of Tripleton, Herefordshire.

According to claims in a copyright lawsuit, the words to \\"Warm Kitty\\" were written by Edith Newlin. In The Big Bang Theory, the song is described by Sheldon as a song sung by his mother when he is ill. The lyrics on The Big Bang Theory are: \\"Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur! Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr purr purr!\\" A scene in an episode of Young Sheldon, the prequel series to The Big Bang Theory, depicts the origin of the song. This aired on February 1, 2018, and shows Sheldon's mother Mary singing the song to her son, who is suffering with the flu. Versions of the song have been released by Australian children's performer Patsy Biscoe and by the long-running ABC children's programme Play School, which predates The Big Bang Theory and has the lyrics reversed, instead going: \\"Warm kitty, soft kitty, little ball of fur. Sleepy kitty, happy kitty, purr purr purr.\\" The song remains part of Play Schools catalogue of children's songs regularly performed on the program: the show's presenters occasionally perform the song for their young viewers. By Christmas 2011, \\"Soft Kitty\\" merchandise‚Äîsuch as a plush stuffed singing Soft Kitty toy or T-shirt with The Big Bang Theory version of the lyrics‚Äîcould be purchased. Copyright lawsuit In December 2015, the heirs of Edith Newlin filed a lawsuit against the various companies associated with The Big Bang Theory,Chase, et al. v. Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc., et al., No. 15-10063 (S.D.N.Y. filed December 28, 2015). claiming that the words and music to the song appeared in the book Songs for the Nursery School published in 1937 by Willis Music, based on a poem by Newlin; the copyright to the book was renewed in 1964. The website for Willis Music states: The suit by Newlin's daughters, on the other hand, claimed that they held the copyright. Furthermore, they alleged that they did not authorize the use of the lyrics, that Willis Music did not have permission to authorize others to use the lyrics, and that the lyrics had been used not only in the television series, but on various kinds of program-associated merchandise without proper permission. On March 27, 2017, US District Court Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald dismissed the suit, holding that the plaintiffs had not shown that they held a copyright on their mother's lyrics.

Shuja's army rested by the tank of Khajwa, about 30 miles to the west of Fatehpur- Haswa in'the Allahabad District, between the Ganges and the Jumna. Background Aurangzeb had defeated his elder brother Dara Shikoh during the Battle of Samugarh and captured Agra and placed his frail father Shah Jahan under house arrest in the Agra Fort. Aurangzeb then imprisoned his younger brother and longtime ally Murad Baksh at Gwalior Fort. Aurangzeb then launched an expedition to capture Lahore fearing that Dara Shikoh and his son Suleiman Shikoh both of whom who had fled westward might capture it first. After capturing Lahore and gaining the support of the Muslim Rajputs in the region, Aurangzeb set out on another expedition towards the eastern territories of the Mughal Empire in Bengal with the sole objective of defeating his brother Shah Shuja. Commanders Shah Shuja employed European gunners for his cannons. He also purchased many of the latest Matchlocks from the European outposts with whom he enjoyed good relations and in return, offered tax exemptions. Shah Shujas army of 25,000 were commanded by his sons Buland Akhtar, Sultan Bang and Zainul Abedin. But his greatest assets were his 10,000 war elephants and three elite war elephants in particular, which were very well armored in chain mail. Aurangzeb had a Mughal Army of almost 90,000 his main commanders were Mir Jumla II, who had good knowledge of the region and Islam Khan was given command of the elite cavalry. Aurangzeb chose to split his army into two forces in the main in the front and the other reserve just behind led by Kilich Khan Bahadur and Shaista Khan. Location The battle was fought at Khajuha, now a small town in district Fatehpur of Uttar Pradesh. It falls in the middle of the Ganga‚ÄìYamuna plains and would have been ideal spot for Shahshuja's elephants with its large open fields. After the victory, Aurangjeb also built a memorial named 'Bagh Badshahi' with a large baithak as well as a big inn with two high gates guarding the central road. 'Bagh Badshahi' is now a preserved monument by Archaeological Survey of India. Battle The Mughal armies of Aurangzeb and Shah Shuja confront each other The armies of Aurangzeb and Shah Shuja fired their cannons at each other until Shah Shuja released his bulky war elephants and believed that his well-trained cannon gunners would reinforce the charge of his war elephants and eliminate any counterattack by Aurangzeb. Bamboo rockets were fired from afar when a war elephant was released and this allowed the coordination and release of other war elephants. This tactic allowed Shah Shuja to gain much control of the battlefield. But Aurangzeb ordered his front to slightly move behind he ordered his cannons to fire long-range shots and his Matchlock Sepoys to take control of the front and halt the arrival of the incoming War Elephants. And just when the war elephants collided with Aurangzeb's Sepoys, Shah Shuja ordered his son Buland Akhtar to lead the elite Sowars against the Sepoys of Aurangzeb. Buland Akhtar's attack was aided by the three armored war elephants and their outcome was highly successful. Aurangzeb's cavalry commander Islam Khan himself was nearly killed by a cannonball while his cavalry was absolutely confused against the War elephants and the assault of the rival cavalry led by Buland Akhtar. Aurangzeb realized the battle was nearly lost and ordered a full-scale attack by his reserves led by Kilich Khan Bahadur and Shaista Khan, the reserve infantry and its Matchlocks then killed many of Shah Shujas, rampaging War elephants and Mir Jumla II then led an advancing Mughal Army to the center of the battlefield braving the artillery of Shah Shuja. As Kilich Khan Bahadur and Mir Jumla II drew nearer so did Aurangzeb's artillery and his reserve cavalry. Buland Akhtar's exhausted and scattered cavalry now withdrew and regrouped around Shah Shuja's cannons that fired gaps into Aurangzeb's approaching infantry. Aurangzeb himself led his cannons forward and then concentrated their firepower at Shah Shuja's center inflicting much disarray against his rivals. As Aurangzeb's reserve Sepoys, Sowars and war elephants came very near and began to overrun Shah Shuja's encampment. Shah Shuja first ordered his European gunners to retreat and later ordered his mainly Mughal forces to withdraw, but it was far too late when Aurangzeb's Zamburak and Sepoy led by Kilich Khan Bahadur had them surrounded causing most his forces eventually organize a mass surrender. Shah Shuja himself chose to flee from his Howdah and then rode away conceding the battlefield to his younger brother the new Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. Aftermath The Hindu rulers of Koch Bihar and the Ahoms began to annex rich Mughal territories, while Aurangzeb dispatched the highly experienced Mir Jumla II to chase his brother Shah Shuja, who had fled to Arakan. Aurangzeb installed Shaista Khan as the new Nawab of Bengal replacing Shah Shuja. Shaista Khan was very strict with the Portuguese, thus emboldening their superiority on the sea, which eventually led to the tragedies of the Child's War.

The compilers are available via the traditional command-line programs but also as APIs available natively from within .NET code. Roslyn exposes modules for syntactic (lexical) analysis of code, semantic analysis, dynamic compilation to CIL, and code emission.Neil McAllister, Microsoft's Roslyn: Reinventing the compiler as we know it, DEVELOPER_WORLD, 2011-10-20 Features The most notable primary features of Roslyn include: * Compilers for the C# and Visual Basic .NET languages exposed as services via APIs. * APIs for code analysis and refactoring. History The code name \\"Roslyn\\" was first written by Eric Lippert (a former Microsoft engineer) in a post that he published to hire developers for a new project. He first said that the origin of the name was because of Roslyn, Washington, but later in the post he speaks ironically about the \\"northern exposure\\" of its office. The city of Roslyn was one of the places where the television series Northern Exposure was filmed. Microsoft made a community technology preview (CTP) available for public download in October 2011.

With increasing complexity and demands for source code analysis in modern integrated development environments, however, compilers need to expose application programming interfaces (APIs) that will help developers to directly perform phases of compilation such as lexical and syntactic structure analysis of source code. Roslyn was designed with that intent from the beginning. This reduces the barrier in developing tools specifically designed for source code analysis. APIs of Roslyn are of three types: feature APIs, work-space APIs and compiler APIs. Feature APIs allow source code tool developers to do code refactoring and fixes. Work-space APIs allow plugin developers to perform actions specifically required in integrated development environments (IDEs) like Visual Studio such as finding references of a variable or code formatting. Compiler APIs allow even more sophisticated analysis of source code, by exposing direct calls to perform syntax tree and binding flow analysis.Overview of Roslyn from GitHub documentation Using an open-source implementation of Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) such as .NET Core, Roslyn will be able to compile in a platform-agnostic manner capable of running CLI code in Linux, OS X, and Windows.

It may be defined as \\"that subdivision of material private law which researches, describes and regulates the origin, contents and dissolution of all legal relationships between: (i) husband and wife (including the parties to a civil union); (ii) parents, guardians (and other holders of parental rights and responsibilities) and children; and (iii) relatives related through blood and affinity.\\"Robinson et al 8.  Subdivisions  There are various branches of family law, among them * the law of engagement; * matrimonial law and the law of civil unions; * matrimonial property law; * the law of divorce; and * the law of parenting.  Marriage  Marriage is the act by which a marriage relationship is formed, and which defines the relationship created by that act. The act and the relationship are interrelated: The former requires an intention to create the latter, and the consequences of the latter flow from the nature of the former.Clark A2. = Development = Ancient Rome distinguished between two forms of marriage: the matrimonium non iustum and the iustae nuptiae (or iustum matrimonium). The former concerned a relationship between one man and one woman who intended to marry but could not do so in terms of Roman law; the latter dealt with formally recognised marriages. Marriage between the Continental peoples under early Germanic law bore a close resemblance to that of the lobolo marriage in terms of the customary law of South African indigenous peoples. In the late Middle Ages, marriage fell under the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Church. This still has some practical consequences in modern South African law.Robinson et al 23. In terms of canon law, marriage was a sacrament and a grace of God to the spouses, and could not be dissolved by any human agency. Divorce, in other words, was almost entirely unlawful. After the Reformation, the rigidities of Catholic marriage began to fall away, and the institution became more secularised, as other systems of marriage were introduced. The province of Holland seems to have been the first European jurisdiction to permit civil marriages. This impact of this on South African law may be gauged from the fact that the country's common law is based primarily on Roman-Dutch law. The basic premises of the Political Ordinance of 1580 still form the basis for the contemporary South African law of marriage,Robinson et al 26. which, while generally located in the private sphere, often crosses over into other areas for the law: for example, the criminal and the constitutional. = Definition = The traditional definition of marriage is a \\"legally recognised life-long voluntary union between one man and one woman to the exclusion of all other persons,\\"Cronje et al 149.A number of the common-law definitions of marriage are cited by Van Zyl J in Ex parte Inkley and Inkley 1995 3 SA 528 (C) 535‚Äì536. or \\"a union of one man and one woman who mutually agree to live together as spouses until the marriage is dissolved by the death of one of them or as otherwise provided by law.\\"Clark A3. In light of recent constitutional developments in South Africa, this definition has been found to be inadequate, particularly as regards its assumptions against polygamy\\"The Roman law marriage was notoriously monogamous\\" (Clark A3). and sex-same life partnerships: In Minister of Home Affairs v Fourie,2006 (1) 524 (CC). it was declared unconstitutional.Para 72.  \\"One man and one woman\\"  The Supreme Court of Appeal, in Fourie v Minister of Home Affairs,2005 3 SA 429 (SCA). held that the common-law definition of marriage deprived committed same-sex couples of the option of marriage and thus denied them its many rights and protections.440G‚Äì441C. This discrimination, on grounds of gender and religion and sexual orientation, was found to be unfair,441D. in that it violated the constitutional right to equalitys 9. and other guarantees in the Bill of Rights. The court held further that the Marriage ActAct 25 of 1961. had been passed on the assumption that the common-law definition applied only to opposite-sex marriage.Paras 26, 27. The common law had to be developed to embrace same-sex partners by redefining marriage as the \\"union of two persons to the exclusion of all others for life.\\" This type of marriage is now capable of full recognition as a legally valid marriage, provided that the formalities in the Marriage Act are complied with.Para 49. In Lesbian and Gay Equality Project v Minister of Home Affairs,2006 3 BCLR 355 (CC). the Marriage Act as well as the common-law definition were challenged. The Constitutional Court held that it was clearly in the interests of justice that it be heard together with the Fourie case.Minister of Home Affairs v Fourie 2006 (1) 524 (CC), para 72. Setting aside the order of the SCA in Fourie's case, the court declared that the common-law definition of marriage was unconstitutional and invalid to the extent that it does not permit same-sex couples to enjoy the same status, benefits and responsibilities as those accorded to heterosexual couples.Para 139. The court was unanimous on the point that the omission from the Marriage Act, after the words \\"or husband,\\"s 30(1). of the words \\"or spouse\\" was inconsistent with the Constitution; section 30(1) of the Marriage Act was therefore invalidated to the extent of the inconsistency. This declaration was suspended for twelve months from the date of the judgment, until 1 December 2006, to allow Parliament to enact remedial legislation. If Parliament failed to do so, section 30(1) would automatically be read thenceforth as including the words \\"or spouse\\" after the words \\"or husband.\\"O'Regan, while agreeing with the findings of the main judgment, dissented as to the remedy, favouring development by the court of the common-law rule, which would allow same-sex couples to be married with immediate effect, by civil-marriage officers and such religious-marriage officers who consider that these marriages fall within the tenets of their religion.  \\"To the exclusion of all other persons\\"  Exclusivity is not a universal characteristic of marriage; it is a special characteristic of Western civil law and the Anglo-American common law marriage.Clark A3.  \\"To live together as spouses\\"  This part of the definition concerns \\"the very heart of the matter,\\"Clark A3. which is to say the object or purpose of marriage. In Christianity, it is intended for the glory of God and other religions, for the avoidance of fornication, for procreation,Genesis 2:18.Mark 10:8.Matthew 19:5. and to provide for the other partner by help and assistance. These aims are also reflected in Roman-Dutch law. The consortium omnis vitae refers to all the duties which fall under the relationship of married spouses.Clark A3.  Dissolution as provided by law  Death dissolves a marriage, but the law provides also for dissolution by the high court on some ground which renders the marriage voidable, or following upon an order presuming the death of the one spouse,Clark A50‚ÄìA52. or on some ground arising after marriage which is recognised as a ground for divorce.Clark A3. = Nature = Marriage has its foundations in a variety of bailiwicks beyond the legal realm, including philosophy, religion, culture and social practice. In Rattigan v Chief Immigration Officer, Zimbabwe,1995 (2) SA 182 (ZS). Gubbay CJ described marriage as > a juristic act sui generis. It gives rise to a physical, moral and spiritual > community of life - a consortium omnis vitae. It obliges the husband and > wife to live together for life (more realistically, for as long as the > marriage endures) and to confer sexual privileges exclusively upon each > other [...]. The duties of cohabitation, loyalty, fidelity and mutual > assistance and support flow from the marital relationship. To live together > as spouses in community of life, to afford each other marital privileges and > to be ever faithful, are the inherent commands which lie at the very heart > of marriage.188B-C. Although a Zimbabwean case, Rattigan is widely cited in South African jurisprudence; it continues: > Marriages are almost invariably entered into by parties who have deep > affection for one another and who intend to devote the remainder of their > lives together. Although the condition of matrimony does not, as a concept > of law, make the spouses one flesh‚Äîuna caro‚Äîit nonetheless embodies the > obligations to found a home, to cohabit, to have children and to live > together as a family unit. It is the most fundamental institution known to > mankind‚Äî\\"the first step from barbarism\\" and \\"the true basis of human > progress\\".189E-F. Gubbay also cited in Rattigan the words of Justice Field in Maynard v Hill,1887 (125) US 190. which characterised marriage as > an institution, in the maintenance of which in its purity the public is > deeply interested, for it is the foundation of the family and of society, > without which there would be neither civilisation nor progress [...]. It is > [...] a social relation, like that of parent and child, the obligations of > which arise not from the consent of concurring minds, but are the creation > of the law itself, a relation the most important, as affecting the happiness > of individuals, the first step from barbarism to incipient civilisation, the > purest tie of social life, and the true basis of human progress.211‚Äì212. That marriage is still held in high regard by modern society is reflected in such cases as Kuhn v Karp,1948 (4) SA 825 (T).840‚Äì841 Ex parte Inkley and Inkley535‚Äì536. and Van der Westhuizen v Van der Westhuizen1996 2 SA 850 (C).852I. In Ryland v Edros,1997 (2) SA 690 (C). Farlam J indicated the need for South African family law to recognise diversity in marriage forms and the possibility of a pluralistic recognition of different forms of marriage, including the potentially polygamous Muslim marriage. The centrality of marriage to many lives, and the centrality to marriage of cohabitation, was further emphasised in the Constitutional Court by O'Regan J in Dawood, Shalabi and Thomas v Minister of Home Affairs.2000 (3) SA 936 (CC). Although the Constitution itself does not expressly protect the right to family life or the right of spouses to cohabit,Para 28.Volks v Robinson2005 (5) BCLR 446 (CC), para 80. the constitutional right to human dignitys 10. has been found to encompass and protect the right of individuals to enter into permanent relationships, including the right to marry.Ex Parte Chairperson of the Constitutional Assembly 1996 (4) SA 744 (CC), para 100. To prohibit such a relationship, and thus to impair the spouses in their duty of cohabitation, would be to frustrate them in their personal fulfilment, and hence would amount to a limitation on the right to dignity.Dawood, para 37. Whether or not such a limitation is constitutional will depend, in terms of the Constitution,s 36(1). on whether or not it is reasonable and justifiable in an open and democratic society.963D. Although the Constitution gives no explicit recognition to the right to marry, South Africa is a signatory to various international instruments which do. In terms of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, > # The family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is > entitled to protection by society and the State. # The right of men and > women of marriageable age to marry and to found a family shall be > recognized. # No marriage shall be entered into without the free and full > consent of the intending spouses.Article 23. Similarly, the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights provides that > # The family shall be the natural unit and basis of society. It shall be > protected by the State which shall take care of its physical health and > moral. # The State shall have the duty to assist the family which is the > custodian of morals and traditional values recognized by the > community.Article 18(1). Finally, according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, \\"The family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the State.\\"Article 16. In Volks v Robinson, endorsing Dawood and enumerating these instruments, the court found that \\"there can be no doubt that our Constitution recognises the institution of marriage.\\"Para 81. It cited a provision in the Bill of Rights which, \\"in substance,\\"Para 81. provides for \\"marriages concluded under any tradition, or a system of religious, personal or family law.\\"s 15(3)(a)(i). The court concluded that \\"both the Constitution and international instruments impose an obligation on our country to protect the institution of marriage.\\"Para 85. This is in line with the establishment of \\"a new legal landscape consistent with the values of diversity, tolerance of difference and the concern for human dignity expressed in the Constitution.\\"Para 181. = Types =  Civil marriage  Civil marriages are concluded in terms of the Marriage Act or the Civil Union Act,Act 17 of 2006. and are not associated by the law with any particular religion. They are monogamous by definition.  Customary marriage  Customary marriages are those concluded in accordance with customary law, which is defined in the Recognition of Customary Marriages ActAct 120 of 1998. as \\"the customs and usages traditionally observed among the indigenous African peoples of South Africa and which form part of the culture of those peoples.\\"s 1. Prior to the year 2000, customary marriages enjoyed only limited recognition, polygamy being contra bonos mores. Since 2000, however,15 November, to be precise. they have enjoyed full recognition under the Act. This is in line with the provision in the Constitution for \\"marriages concluded under any tradition, or a system of religious, personal or family law.\\"s 15(3). Customary marriages are now valid and in all respects equal in status to civil marriage,Robinson et al 44. so that the Act is similar in its consequences and regulations to the Marriage Act and Civil Union Act, although the requirements for a valid marriage are different. South African law, generally speaking, does not permit polygamous marriages. The Act provides the only exception to this rule, in that it allows for polygyny, but only if it has been concluded under customary law and complies with the provisions of the Act. The constitutionality of polygamy and lobolo is a contentious issue, requiring their balance against the rights of equalitys 9. and of dignity.s 10.  Muslim marriage  A Muslim marriage is one concluded in terms of Islamic religious law or rites. = Statutory recognition = Muslim marriages enjoy some statutory recognition under the Criminal Procedure Act (CPA)Act 51 of 1977. and the Children's Act.Act 38 of 2005.s 1. In terms of the former, \\"for the purposes of the law of evidence in criminal proceedings, 'marriage' shall include [...] any marriage concluded under any system of religious law.\\"s 195(2). In terms of the latter, > \\"marriage\\" means a marriage‚Äî ::(a) recognised in terms of South African law > or customary law; or ::(b) concluded in accordance with a system of > religious law subject to specified procedures, and any reference to a > husband, wife, widower, widow, divorced person, married person or spouse > must be construed accordingly.s 1(1). There is, however, no express recognition, so that statutes are generally interpreted by the judiciary to include Muslim marriages. In Daniels v Campbell,2004 (5) SA 331 (CC). an application was made for confirmation of an order of the Cape High Court which had declared invalid and unconstitutional certain provisions of the Maintenance ActAct 27 of 1990. and the Intestate Succession ActAct 81 of 1987. for their failure to recognise as \\"spouses\\" persons married according to Muslim rites. Sachs held that the word \\"spouse\\" in its ordinary meaning includes parties to a Muslim marriage, because such a reading corresponds to the way the word is generally understood and used, and because it would be far more awkward from a linguistic point of view to exclude parties to a Muslim marriage from the word \\"spouse\\" than to include them. The historic exclusion did not flow from the courts giving the word its ordinary meaning but from a linguistically strained use of the word flowing from a particular cultural and racial approach, owing more to prejudice than to the English language, so that both the impact and the intent of the restricted interpretation was discriminatory.Para 19. In Women's Legal Centre Trust v President of the Republic of South Africa2009 (6) SA 94 (CC). it fell to the Constitutional Court to decide whether the President and Parliament had failed in their exclusive constitutional obligation to enact legislation governing Muslim marriages. The court found that the obligation in fact did not fall exclusively on Parliament and the President, and that, in terms of the Constitution,s 167(4)(e). the court did not have exclusive jurisdiction to entertain the application. The question, therefore, of whether or not Parliament and the President are under an obligation (even if not exclusive) to recognise Muslim marriage, and whether or not such legislation would be consistent with the Constitution,ss 9, 10, 15, 31. went unanswered. = Judicial recognition = Before the new constitutional dispensation, the recognition of Muslim marriages was regarded as a \\"retrograde step and entirely immoral.\\"Hassam v Jacobs 2009 (5) SA 572 (CC) at para 25. The Appellate Division, in Ismail v Ismail,1983 (1) SA 1006 (A). noted, \\"in passing, that it seems unlikely that the non-recognition of polygamous unions will cause any real hardship to the members of the Muslim community, except, perhaps, in isolated instances.\\"1024H-1025A. This was rejected in Hassam v Jacobs.Para 25. The Cape Provincial Division, in Ryland v Edros, held that a court may recognise and enforce contractual obligations arising out of Muslim marriages, provided that those marriages are monogamous. In Amod v MMVF, the action was for payment of damages and loss of support after the death of a spouse, married in terms of Islamic law and not registered under Marriage Act. The duty of support was found to be legally enforceable for monogamous Muslim marriages, but the issue of polygyny was left open. It was in Kahn v Kahn2005 (2) SA 272 (T). that spouses in polygynous Muslim marriages were finally held, in terms of the Maintenance Act,s2(1). to have a legally enforceable duty of support to one another. In Hassam v Jacobs, the issue was whether or not the benefits provided by the Intestate Succession Act and the Maintenance Act accrue to surviving spouses of polygynous Muslim marriages. The objective of the acts is to ensure that widows receive at least a child's share instead of being precariously dependent on family benevolence. The Cape High Court found that the Intestate Succession Act,s 1(4)(f). in discriminating on grounds of gender and religion and marital status, was inconsistent with the Constitution. The word \\"spouse\\" in the Act would be interpreted henceforth to include spouses in polygynous Muslim marriages, while \\"survivor\\" in the Maintenance Act would be read to include surviving partners of polygynous Muslim marriages. In the Constitutional Court, however, it was found that \\"spouse\\" was not reasonably capable of being understood to include more than one spouse in the context of polygynous Muslim marriages. The words \\"or spouses,\\" therefore, are to be read in after each use of the word \\"spouse\\" in the Act. In summary, the constitutional validity of polygamy has not been subject to judicial scrutiny‚Äîindeed, it has been avoided‚Äîand the current position is that Muslim marriages receive only limited recognition in South African law. In the Draft Muslim Marriages Bill, there are both provisions in support of recognitionss 9(3)-(4), 15(1), 15(3), 30, 31. and provisions against it.ss 9(3)-(4), 10.  Hindu marriage  Singh v Ramparsad2007 (3) SA 445 (D). dealt with a marriage in terms of the Vedic sect of religious Hindu marriage, and an application for an order declaring # that the Marriage Act recognises the solemnisation or validity of Hindu marriage; and, in the alternative, # that section 11(3) of the Act is unconstitutional. The application was dismissed on grounds of legal impossibility. A marriage concluded in terms of religious law, and compliant with the civil requirements, enjoys dual validity. The secular dissolution of such a marriage in terms of the Divorce ActAct 70 of 1979. does not have the effect of dissolving the religious marriage if, as is usually the case, that religion has its own specific requirements for dissolution. The only means for dissolving such a marriage would be to attack successfully the non-recognition of divorce in Hindu religious law. The courts could not and would not interfere in this regard. In Govender v Ragavayah,2009 (3) SA 178 (D). the court dealt with an application for an order declaring a Hindu widow to be recognised as a spouse in terms of Intestate Succession Act. This it granted, reading the word \\"spouse\\" in the Act to include partners in monogamous Hindu marriages.  Domestic partnerships  = Opposite-sex domestic partnerships = A domestic partnership is defined by \\"living together outside marriage in a relationship which is analogous to, or has most of the characteristics of a marriage.\\"Cronje & Heaton 227. The status quo is that none of the consequences of legal marriage is automatically conferred on an opposite-sex domestic partnership. There is, however, some statutory recognition in the Compensation for Occupational Injuries and Diseases Act,Act 130 of 1993. and judicial recognition in the form of Volks v Robinson, which concerned a man and a woman who had lived together in a permanent life partnership. When he died, she lodged a claim for maintenance against his estate in terms of the Maintenance Act but was rejected by the executor. Having never married him, she did not fit the Act's definition of \\"survivor.\\" It was requested of the court that it read-in partners in domestic partnerships or alternatively declare unconstitutional the relevant provision for its unjustifiable discrimination and its violation of the right to dignity.s 10. Handed down before the passage of the Civil Union Act, the majority judgment found that there had been no duty of support while the man had been alive, so there should be no duty for maintenance by his estate following his death. Domestic partnerships are currently self-recognised and regulated. The partners may jointly enter into contracts of sale and lease, as well as into a universal partnership, whereby they agree to put in common all their property, universorum bonorum: not only what they have but also what they later acquire. Universal partnerships may be entered on either express or tacit terms, but both partners will be required to contribute, and the official objective is to make a profit. Alternatives to the universal partnership exist in the form of life partnership contracts and contracts of agency. It is also worth noting that a person may leave his estate to anyone in his will. There is considerable debate over the future status of domestic partnerships in South Africa, particularly among feminists. The South African Law Reform Commission published a Discussion Paper on the subject in March 2006. The Civil Union Act requires registration and has a same-sex focus. The Domestic Partnerships Bill, providing for the legal recognition of domestic partnerships and the enforcement of their legal consequences, was tabled on 14 January 2008. Its preamble observes that, under the Constitution, everyone is equal before the law and has the right to its equal protection and benefit.9(1). The Bill still distinguishes between registered and unregistered partnerships.s 1. = Same-sex partnerships = The foremost protection of gay, lesbian and bisexual people in South Africa is section 9 of the Constitution, which forbids discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.  Statutory recognition  Same-sex partnerships also enjoy statutory recognition in South Africa, as of 30 November 2006, under the Civil Union Act, which provides for * the right to enter into a civil union, open to both opposite-sex and same-sex couples, which may be called either a \\"marriage\\" or a \\"civil partnership\\";s 11(1). * the right of a marriage officer, employed by the state, to refuse to marry same-sex couples on grounds of \\"conscience, religion or belief;\\"s 6. * all rights and obligations and benefits of a marriage to be afforded to civil unions.s 13. In the landmark case of Fourie, discussed above, four main arguments were made in opposition to the recognition of same-sex partnerships: # the inability of same-sex partners to procreate; # the need to respect religion; # the constitutional necessity to have recourse to diverse family law systems;s 15. and # the recognition given by international law to heterosexual marriage.Para 84. These were all ultimately rejected, and the separate-but-equal approach strongly dismissed as historically \\"a threadbare cloak for covering distaste for or repudiation by those in power of the group subjected to segregation.\\"Para 150.  Judicial recognition  There is now considerable jurisprudence in recognition of the right to equality of same-sex partners. The following judgments, excluding the already-discussed Fourie, illustrate its development: * National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality v Minister of Justice1999 (1) SA 6 (CC). dealt with a challenge to the constitutionality of the offence of sodomy, and required consideration of the common law. The court found that it amounted to a violation of the right to equality (which cannot be limited) by unfairly discriminating against gay men on basis of sexual orientation. * In National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality v Minister of Home Affairs,2000 (2) SA 1 (CC). the Alien Controls ActAct 96 of 1991. was found to be unconstitutional in denying same-sex partners the same rights as heterosexual partners.s 25(5). Immigration rights were thus extended to the foreign partners of South African citizens in same-sex relationships. * Satchwell v President of the Republic of South Africa2002 (6) SA 1. involved a challenge to certain provisions in the Judge's Remuneration and Conditions of Employment Act,Act 47 of 2001. which were found to be unconstitutional in their denial to same-sex life partners of the benefits usually afforded to a judge's spouse. * In Du Plessis v Road Accident Fund,2004 (1) SA 359 (SCA). a same-sex couple had lived together in a long-term relationship, having gone through a ceremony similar to marriage, and would have married had it been possible. They had the intention of reciprocal duty of support. The court held, however, that to extend to such partners the common-law action for loss of support would be an incremental step to ensure that the common law accorded with the dynamic and evolving fabric of South African society as reflected in the Constitution, recent legislation and judicial pronouncements,Para 37. and therefore that the plaintiff was entitled to claim damages from the defendant for loss of that support.Para 42. * In Gory v Kolver,2007 (4) SA 97 (CC). when Henry Brooks died intestate, his parents nominated Daniel Kolver to be the executor of his estate, this decision being made on the basis that Brooks had no spouse. Mark Gory, however, wished to inherit in terms of Intestate Succession Act. The court held that the relationship between Brooks and Gory amounted to a same-sex permanent life partnership, and that they had pursued reciprocal duties of support. The exclusion of same-sex partners from the Act was unconstitutional, and the court ordered a reading-in of words \\"or partner in a permanent same-sex life partnership in which the partners have undertaken reciprocal duties of support.\\" It is unlikely, given the provisions of Civil Union Act and its recognition of same-sex marriages, that the court will hear very many such cases in the future.  Engagement  An engagement, which is an agreement sui generis, is generally defined in the common law as \\"a legal agreement between a man and a woman to marry each other on a specific or determinable date.\\"Law24.com 2011. Despite the constitutional developments discussed previously, this definition remains in place today. = Requirements =  Capacity  * To enter into an engagement, one must generally be eighteen years of age (the age of majority) or older. * Minors require the consent of both their parents or guardians (unless certain circumstances are in place or a court order is granted). Removal of consent results in the immediate termination of the engagement. * Persons with mental illness cannot become engaged.  Consensus  Consensus is prevented, inter alia, by mistake, misrepresentation, metus and undue influence. = Mistake = Mistake may take two following forms: # Error in persona (mistake as to the person with whom consensus has been reached); and # Error in negotio (mistake as to nature of the juristic act). Mistake results in the engagement's being void. There can be no claim for damages by either party. = Misrepresentation = Misrepresentation occurs where, had the innocent party known the truth, he or she would not have become engaged to the other party. The rescission of an engagement is justified where the misrepresentation is material. If it seriously jeopardises the possibility of achieving a happy and harmonious marriage, the engagement will be void. Misrepresentation will render the engagement voidable at the instance of the innocent party. Among the legitimate grounds for terminating the engagement are such personal qualities as impotence, sterility and serious mental illness. The issue of misrepresentation by omission was raised in Schnaar v Jansen,1924 (45) NPD 218. where one of the parties to the engagement omitted to mention * that one of her uncles had been found guilty of (and hanged for) murdering his wife; * that another uncle was in an interracial marriage; and * that her brother had been convicted of housebreaking and theft. The court held, however, that as none concerned a personal quality of hers, she was under no obligation to disclose these facts to her then-fianc√©. She was therefore able to claim damages for breach of promise of marriage. An engagement may also be rescinded on the ground of innocent misrepresentation. In Thelemann v Von Geyso,1957 (3) SA 39 (W). Von Geyso was coaxed into a marriage on the belief, which Thelemann held also, that she was pregnant. He was successful in his defence. = Metus = Metus or duress is another grounds for terminating the engagement.Robinson et al 66. It is where one make threats to other party to agree on engagement = Undue influence = Undue influence is another grounds for terminating the engagement.Robinson et al 66.  Lawfulness  One must have competence to marry if one is to enter into an engagement. One cannot become engaged, for instance, while one is married to someone else. In Friedman v Harris,1928 CPD 43. it was held that payment for the promise to become engaged renders the engagement void, as it is contra bonos mores, and the payer will not be entitled to return of the amount paid. If one party was unaware, entering into the engagement, that the other was married, he or she may bring action against the other party.  Possibility  Performance of the engagement contract will be impossible if the parties are not permitted to marry. This is always the case for minors below the age of puberty and for parties who fall within prohibited degrees of relationship. = Consequences = Engagement confers the duty to marry and to be faithful. There is no duty, however, to be intimate. The date of marriage must be set within a reasonable time, and there will be a breach of promise if a party refuses to marry on the agreed-upon date. An engagement may be concluded subject to conditions, but these may not be immoral, illegal, impossible or in conflict with the nature of marriage. = Termination = Engagement is terminated most obviously on marriage, but it may also be terminated * by the death of one of the parties; * by mutual agreement; * in the case of minors, by the withdrawal of parental consent; and * by unilateral termination.  Unilateral termination  A unilateral termination must be justified; it must constitute a iusta causa, such as sterility, impotence, hereditary disease or a serious crime. Ceasing to love the other party does not constitute a iusta causa; nor, as in Schaar, does the non-disclosure of facts which do not bear on the personal qualities of the party who omitted them. A mistaken impression as to \\"the nature, mental worth, appearance, status or financial position of the other does not constitute a ground for terminating the engagement and is, therefore, irrelevant.\\".Clark A9. According to Innocent P.Chigume, A serious argument concerning the matrimonal property system which is to operate in the marriage would probably also be considered a justa causa. In Krull v Sangerhaus,1980 (4) SA 299 (E). the court held that, to constitute a iusta causa for unilateral termination, the cause must be of a sufficiently serious nature. The allegation of a dispute between the parties' parents regarding the wedding reception, even if it also involved the parties, was \\"too frivolous a circumstance to warrant a repudiation.\\"302C. If the unilateral termination is unjustified, it will amount to a breach of promise. = Breach of promise = The unreported case of Van Jaarsveld v Bridges 2010 (4) SA 558 (SCA)2008 ZAGPHC 342. deals with the constitutional approach. The claimant should keep contractual damages separate from delictual damages. One may not claim performance for breach of promise.  Contractual damages  Contractual damages (patrimonial loss from the breach of promise) are calculated on the basis of positive interest. The courts are not consistent in this regard; each case is determined on its specific merits. The courts will, however, consider the following elements: * the manner of the breach; * the motives behind the breach; * social status; * the plaintiff's age; and * potential for future marriage. It is probably best to say that damages are sui generis in this area of the law. In Guggenheim v Rosenbaum1961 (4) SA 21 (W). a divorced woman in New York met a man domiciled in South Africa. After accepting his proposal, it was arranged that she would come to South Africa to marry him. She gave up her flat, her car and certain of her furniture (the rest being stored), as well as her employment. On their arrival in Johannesburg, however, he refused to marry her. The court found that theirs was a valid engagement and therefore that she was entitled to both actual and prospective loss. Sepheri v Scanlan2008 (1) SA 322 (C). sets out some of the factors to be considered in assessing contractual damages, among them engagement for a long period of years, constant travel and possibly community of property.  Delictual damages  Delictual damages, for the infringement of personality rights, require the plaintiff to prove # injury to a personality interest (Actio iniuriarum); and # intention to injure (Animus iniuriandi). The amount of damages is left to the discretion of the court based on several factors: * the way in which breach occurred; * the motives behind that course of conduct; * the social status of the parties; and * previous life experiences. Sepheri v Scanlan 2008 (1) SA 322 (C) involved an engagement of more than five years and the relinquishment of career prospects, but no delictual damages (for iniuria or contumelia) were awarded. In light of the contractual damages awarded, the court determined that it would be inappropriate to make an additional award in respect of conduct \\"which for all its emotional pyrotechnics was an inevitable consequence of ferocious litigation.\\"337H-I. = Seduction = Damages may be claimed for seduction, or extramarital sex with a virgin with her consent. The plaintiff will need to prove # that she was a virgin; # that she was seduced; and # that sexual intercourse resulted from that seduction. In M v M1991 (4) SA 587 (D). a Hindu marriage was entered into between a minor and the defendant, a major. An agreement was reached between the defendant and the plaintiff, acting in his capacity as father and natural guardian of his minor daughter, that the marriage would subsequently be registered according to the laws of South Africa. After their Hindu marriage, the minor (a virgin), in anticipation of their civil marriage, allowed the defendant to have sex with her. The defendant subsequently repudiated his obligation to register the marriage, and the plaintiff claimed damages for seduction and breach of promise to marry. The court found that the fact that the defendant's father and the plaintiff had negotiated the terms of the marriage in accordance with Hindu custom did not have the result that no privity of contract existed between the minor and the defendant. The Marriage Act did not prohibit the contracting of a valid espousal through the agency of another. The defendant, therefore, was bound to his undertaking to register the marriage. His failure to honour that obligation without lawful excuse constituted a breach of promise.  Return of engagement gifts  The return of engagement gifts depends on two things: the type of gift and the manner in which the engagement was terminated. = Types of gifts = Three types of gift can be distinguished:  Sponsalitia largitas  Sponsalitia largitas or donationes propter nuptias are gifts made in anticipation of marriage. The intention is to confer a lasting benefit during the marriage on the receiver. These include, for example, a house, a car and jewellery. There is a presumption, indeed, that valuable gifts of a lasting nature, given during the engagement, were given in anticipation of the marriage.Robinson et al 74.  Arrhae sponsalitiae  Arrhae sponsalitiae are gifts which reflect the seriousness of the intention of the donor to marry the other party. These are given with the intention that they will be forfeited to the receiver should the donor commit a breach of promise. The engagement ring, therefore, may be retained by the receiver and need only be returned if the engagement is terminated without any fault on the part of the donor.Robinson et al 74.  Small tokens  Small tokens are unconditional gifts, given as tokens of affection. These include, for example, flowers. = Manner of termination =  Mutual consent  The general rule is that all gifts, other than small tokens of affection and those which have been alienated or lost or consumed, must be returned if the engagement is terminated by mutual consent.  justa causa  The general rule also applies if the engagement is broken off for a reason not imputable to the fault of one of the parties; for instance, if one of them has become insane or impotent, or because both parties' conduct has become such to make marriage unlikely.  Breach of promise  If the engagement has been wrongfully terminated by one of the parties, the innocent party may recover all gifts except those of negligent value.

Notes  family law ","title":"South African family law"},{"id":"33644298","text":"The Scott Viking 1 was a single seat, high-performance glider designed and built in the UK just before the Second World War. Only four were constructed, one setting records in Argentina and another remaining active into the 1980s. Design and development The Viking 1 was an all-wood aircraft, with a single spar cantilever shoulder wing which was fabric covered behind the spar. In plan, the wing had constant chord in the central section and tapered outer panels with rounded tips. The outer panels, each about one third of the span, carried full width, variable droop ailerons. A pair of hinged plate spoilers was fitted at mid-chord on the centre section. The wing had slight dihedral. The fuselage was oval in section and plywood skinned. The single seat cockpit was just ahead of the wings and had a multi-part, detachable, transparent canopy with a rather abrupt forward profile and a brief fairing aft. The fuselage narrowed to the rear where the tapered tailplane was mounted just above the fuselage on a short sub-fin or pedestal. There was no fixed fin; the tapered, rounded, fabric covered rudder extended to the lower fuselage and moved in a cut-out in the elevators. A single main skid reached from the nose to below the trailing edge of the wing, with a bumper style tail skid on the extreme rear fuselage. A larger span derivative, the Scott Viking 2, was the first British high performance two seat sailplane. Operational history The prototype Viking 1 first flew, from Dunstable Downs, on 6 November 1938. Three more were completed. The prototype was taken to Buenos Aires by R. P. Cooper, who flew, then sold, it there. By 1944 it was being flown in Argentina by Roberto Madson, setting new records. A Viking 1 took part, though without distinction, in the last pre-war UK National Soaring Competition, held at the Derbyshire and Lancashire Gliding Club's site at Camphill, Great Hucklow in mid-July 1939. At least two of the three UK-based Vikings, all of which had appeared on the British Gliding Association register, were impressed into war service. From August 1940 BGA425 served at RAF Ringway with the Glider Flight, renamed the Glider Training Squadron on 22 August 1940 and transferred to a new base at RAF Thame on 28 December 1940. Its initial role at Ringway was to develop glider instrumentation for military use. Another example of the type was with the Air Training Corps; they may have been engaged in radar calibration experiments; both were taken out of use by 1942. The third Viking, registered BGA 416, remained active with the Leicestershire Gliding Club at Husbands Bosworth until at least 1984. It was moved to the Gliding Heritage Centre at Lasham Airfield in August 2015.

She was the primary concubine of Wang Shenzhi (Prince Zhongyi), who was commonly regarded as the founder of the Min state, and the mother of Wang Yanjun (also known as Wang Lin, Emperor Huizong), the first Min ruler to claim the title of emperor. Background It is not known when the future Empress Dowager Huang was born, but it was known that she was from Quan Prefecture (Ê≥âÂ∑û, in modern Quanzhou, Fujian). Her father Huang Nayu () was a cousin of Huang Tao (), who had served as the secretary to a military governor (Jiedushi) of Weiwu Circuit (), the territory of which later formed the state of Min.Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms (ÂçÅÂúãÊò•Áßã), vol. 94. (As Wang Shenzhi's older brother and predecessor Wang Chao was the first military governor of Weiwu and Wang Shenzhi was the second, Huang Tao's service was likely under Wang Chao.)History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 134. When Huang Nayu himself served under Wang Shenzhi, Wang Shenzhi took Lady Huang as his primary concubine; she was the mother of his second son Wang Yanjun. Wang Shenzhi, who carried the title of Prince of Min at that time, died in 925 and was succeeded initially by his oldest son Wang Yanhan.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 274. Wang Yanhan claimed the title of King of Min in 926, but was killed later that year in a joint revolt by Wang Yanjun and Wang Shenzhi's adoptive son Wang Yanbing. Wang Yanjun took over the governance of the territory, initially only claiming the title of acting military governor of Weiwu. Emperor Mingzong of Later Tang (r. 926-933) commissioned him as full military governor in 927 and created him the Prince of Langye,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 275. and then as the Prince of Min in 928.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 276. As some point, Emperor Mingzong also created Lady Huang the Lady of Lu. In gratitude, Wang Yanjun submitted a tribute of platinum. As empress dowager and grand empress dowager In 933, Wang Yanjun claimed the title of Emperor of Min and changed his name to Wang Lin. Later that year, he honored Lady Huang as empress dowager.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 278. (As his era name was Longqi, she became known in historical sources as \\"Empress Dowager Longqi.\\") In 934, when Jian Prefecture (Âª∫Â∑û, in modern Nanping, Fujian) was under siege by Jiang Yanhui (), a general of Min's northwestern neighbor Wu, Wang Lin initially commissioned his general Zhang Yanrou () and his brother Wang Yanzong () to lead an army to relieve the siege on Jian Prefecture. However, the soldiers mutinied on the way to Jian Prefecture and clamored for Wang Lin to send his much-despised chief of staff Xue Wenjie to them for their disposal. Wang Lin initially took no action, but both Empress Dowager Huang and Wang Lin's oldest son Wang Jipeng advocated for Xue to be delivered to the soldiers. When Wang Lin made no overt opposition to their advocacy, Wang Jipeng seized Xue outside the palace gates and delivered him to the soldiers, who put him to death and cannibalized his body. They then continued the march to Jian Prefecture. With Min forces and forces from Min's northern ally Wuyue converging on Jian Prefecture, Jiang withdrew. At one point, Wang Lin visited the Huang clan home and ancestral shrine in Quan Prefecture; the ground, the fields, and the trees were covered with silk for his visit. When Huang Kejia (), the son of one of Empress Dowager Huang's cousins, informed him that, because the home was built close to the sea, it felt as cold as winter even during the fall, he decreed that clay be given to the Huang clan so that they could reinforce the bricks with it to better insulate the home. In 935, Wang Jipeng assassinated Wang Lin and Wang Lin's wife Empress Chen Jinfeng, and then took over the throne (as Emperor Kangzong), claiming to be doing so under Empress Dowager Huang's orders.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 279. In 936, Wang Jipeng (who had by that point changed his name to Wang Chang) honored her as grand empress dowager.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 280.

He is best known as the lead guitarist in the art-rock band, David Devant and his Spirit Wife, and in the 1983-5 incarnation of The Monochrome Set. Foster also plays guitar, musical saw and vibraslap in the house band of Karaoke Circus and occasional saw in Martin White's Mystery Fax Machine Orchestra. He plays ukulele and other instruments as part of the double-act, Foster and Gilvan, and is also musical director of Sawchestra ‚Äì a band of musical saw players who perform Foster's compositions to accompany silent films. The Monochrome Set Foster grew up in Pimlico, West London. In his late teens, he formed his first band, the New Romantic Los Apach√©s, in which he was songwriter and played lead guitar. Los Apach√©s became press darlings for well over two months in the winter of 1979, and Foster was 'nicknamed the Kaftan Kid by the NME for some strange reason'. In 1983, he was talent-spotted by Andy Warren, bass player of The Monochrome Set, who was looking for a replacement for the departing guitarist, Lester Square. The band had just released the single, \\"Jet Set Junta\\", which 'nodded to the previous year's Falkland Islands conflict, becoming a big indie hit and garnering extensive play.'Jonathan Buckley and Mark Ellingham (eds) Rock:The Rough Guide, Rough Guides Ltd, 1996, p581 One of Foster's first tasks was to appear in the video for \\"Jet Set Junta\\", miming to Lester Square's guitar part. Foster went on to play on the band's fourth album, the pop-flavoured The Lost Weekend (1985), which included the singles \\"Wallflower\\" and \\"Jacob's Ladder\\". In the video for the latter, Foz dressed in a bear costume ‚Äì the first of many animal costumes he would wear on stage. Although these were the most commercial-sounding records released by the Monochrome Set, sales were disappointing, and the band split up. In 2009, when The Lost Weekend was re-released on CD by Cherry Red Records, The Guardian journalist, John Robb, wrote, \\"It's clearly time we resurrected the Monochrome Set, arguably the first truly postmodern pop band.\\"John Robb, The Monochrome Set: Remembering the band that history forgot, The Guardian, 9 January 2009 David Devant and his Spirit Wife After moving to Brighton, Foster met the artist and songwriter, Mikey Georgeson and, at the beginning of the 1990s, they formed David Devant & His Spirit Wife. All the band adopted stage names, with Georgeson as the Vessel on vocals and guitar, Professor Rimschott (Graham Carlow) on drums and the Colonel (Jem Egerton) on bass. Foster was renamed Foz?, pronounced 'Foz Questionmark'. A Devant gig was an unforgettable theatrical experience, incorporating stage magic with cardboard props, manipulated by the 'spectral roadies', Iceman and Cocky Young'un. The Vessel might be fired from a cannon, levitated or sawn in half, and the climax of every show was the appearance of the Spirit Wife, who manifested herself in the form of a Victorian lace nightie waved on a long pole. The band won a fanatically loyal following and positive, though sometimes bemused, reviews. Caroline Sullivan described a 1996 show in the Guardian: 'Led by a quiffed and moustachioed waif called the Vessel, they offer penny-dreadful glam rock augmented by a host of special effects. The music alone is worth the price of admission ... but the Devants strive to provide a more complete experience... Long may they do their strange thing.'.Caroline Sullivan, Review of David Devant at the Splash Club London, The Guardian, 8 August 1996. The theatricality of an early Devant show was captured in the video for their debut single, \\"Pimlico\\". In 1997, the band released their first full length album, Work Lovelife, Miscellaneous. In March, Radio-One breakfast presenter, Mark Radcliffe, chose the single, \\"Ginger\\", written by Georgeson and Foster, as his record of the week. Radcliffe said, 'Initially I was intrigued by the look of them, by the name, by the image. Then I heard some really good songs...Unless the records themselves work there is no point to all the theatricality. But this lot are messing about with the concept of what makes a pop band. Their act isn't just a gimmick. We need more bands like them.'Robin Eggar, 'Could it be Magic?', Style Magazine, The Sunday Times, 20 April 1997 Although Foster left the band in the late 1990s, he rejoined for their third album, Power Words for Better Living (2004). David Devant and his Spirit Wife still perform two or three times a year. Foster and Gilvan Foster and Gilvan at the Phoenix Gallery, Brighton, in August 2008 Foster's next collaboration was with another fine artist, Christopher Gilvan-Cartwright, known by the stage name Baron Gilvan. As Foster and Gilvan, they wear clown make-up and perform their own songs, with Foster playing ukulele and other instruments, and Gilvan singing and playing the trombone. Foster and Gilvan often work with the puppeteer, Isobel Smith, who is Gilvan's partner. Baron Gilvan has also performed as a spectral roadie for David Devant, and is a resident judge at Karaoke Circus. Sawchestra \\"Sawchestra perform Musical Surgery\\" at the Basement, Brighton in 2008. Foster is playing the theremin at the rear. In 2008, Foster, Sara Passmore and Andrew Page (raxil4) created Sawchestra, a band of musicians playing saws and other instruments. Their first show, 'Sawchestra perform Musical Surgery' was staged at Brighton's live art venue, the Basement, on 4 October 2008. The space had been converted into an operating theatre and the band wore surgical gowns and masks. Foster went on to compose a soundtrack for the 1926 animated classic, The Adventures of Prince Achmed. In 2011, Sawchestra performed Prince Achmed in various theatres and festivals, and at the Folly for a Flyover, a pop-up venue beneath a flyover on the A12 in Hackney Wick. Foster's next soundtrack was for the 1920 horror film, The Golem: How He Came into the World, which Sawchestra performed at the Apollo Theatre, Piccadilly, as part of the 2011 London Sci-Fi Festival. Wired, reviewing the festival, wrote, 'Particular highlights included a screening of silent German classic Der Golem, its score played by innovative musical ensemble Sawchestra using a variety of household tools and unusual implements.'Matt Kamen, \\"Review: 2011 Sci-Fi London Festival is a Capital Event\\", Wired, 4 May 2011 There was also 'Adrift with the Sawchestra', on 17 July 2011, when the band staged a series of floating performances on a barge on the Regent's Canal, as part of Barbican Bite's contribution to the Shoreditch Festival. Karaoke Circus Foster is a long-standing collaborator with Martin White, playing in his Mystery Fax Machine Orchestra and in the house band for Ward and White's Karaoke Circus, where comedians sing karaoke over a live band. After singing with Karaoke Circus, the comedian Dave Gorman wrote in his blog: \\"I was stupidly excited to be \\"singing\\" because the lead guitarist in the band is Foz from the excellent David Devant & His Spirit Wife.

Kazerooni‚Äôs work focuses on the control of human-machine systems specific to lower human extremities. After developing BLEEX, ExoHiker, and ExoClimber ‚Äì three super-light, load-carrying exoskeletons ‚Äì Berkeley Bionics and his team created HULC (Human Universal Load Carrier). It is the first energetically- autonomous, orthotic, lower extremity exoskeleton, providing the ability for its user to carry 200-pound weights over any sort of terrain for an extended period of time without undue effort. These exoskeletons reduce the possibility of the wearer becoming fatigued and reaching their physiological endurance limit during critical military or industrial missions. HULC technology is currently licensed to Lockheed Martin for military applications. Kazerooni is currently working on extending this technology to aid persons who have experienced a stroke, spinal cord injuries or medical conditions that obligate them to use a wheelchair. In 2011, the Berkeley Robotics and Human Engineering Laboratory enabled Austin Whitney, a paraplegic student at the University of California, Berkeley, to walk for commencement., CNN Kazerooni has started a project to develop low-cost exoskeleton systems to enable independence for individuals with gait deficiencies called the AUSTIN Project., Berkeley Robotics and Human Engineering Laboratory: Medical Exoskeletons The Austin project is named after the first pilot for their medical exoskeleton. Prior to his research work on lower extremity exoskeletons, Kazerooni led his team to successfully develop robotics systems that enhance human upper extremity strength. The results of this work led to a new class of intelligent assist devices currently being used by workers worldwide for manipulating heavy objects in distribution centers and factories. Kazerooni has also been conducting research on human performance in coordinated haptic-visual virtual environments under several contracts from NASA. Other research interests are biomimetic design, haptics, non-linear control systems, embedded systems, networked control systems, power regeneration, monopropellant and portable energy generation methods for mobile platforms.

Typically made from a knitted material, popular styles of knit currently are the cable and fairisle knit. Boot socks provide additional comfort and warmth in colder weather. Boots are often worn by both genders, with military boots, brogue boots and hiking boots all being popular styles to pair with boot socks. Boot socks vary in lengths, ranging from normal sized socks to knee high length socks. Uses Boot socks can be worn for comfort or for fashion. Rolling up the cuff on pants to show a glimpse of the boot sock is a trend which has been highlighted by various fashion sources. Rolling the boot socks down in a scruffy way adds a unique touch to a look. Another way to style them includes wearing the socks with knee high boots and knee high riding boots with knee length or over the knee length boot socks. They can be worn alone or over tights, leggings, or jeans, scrunched down or pulled up at the top of the boots. This style of wearing boot socks is fashionable with young girls, tweens, teens, college age girls and women. Boots are seen as hard wearing footwear and aren't as comfortable to wear as most shoes, so wearing a decent sock is crucial. Wearing boot socks has become popular with the Wellington Boot and hiking boots, as well as for any other sporting activity involving walking long distances.

He was the best English two-year-old of 1904, winning all five of his races. In 1905 Cicero became one of the shortest priced successful favourites in the history of the Derby, winning at 4/11 to remain undefeated. He won only once from his remaining three races before retiring to a modestly successful career at stud. Background Cicero, a small chestnut colt, was bred by his owner Lord Rosebery, the former Prime Minister, at his stud at The Durdans, near Epsom. He was sired by Cyllene, an Ascot Gold Cup winner, who went on to become a highly successful stallion. In addition to Cicero, he sired three other winners of The Derby and through his grandson, Phalaris, he is the direct male-line ancestor of most modern thoroughbreds. His dam, Gas, a filly also bred by Lord Rosebery, was a half-sister of the Derby winner Ladas and proved to be an influential broodmare: her descendants included the classic winners Vaucluse (1915 1000 Guineas), Happy Laughter (1000 Guineas) and Shirley Heights (1978 Epsom Derby). Cicero was sent into training with Percy Peck at Harraton Court, Exning, near Newmarket, Suffolk. In training, Cicero was a lively, high-spirited type who could be seen bucking and kicking at exercise. One writer commented that he \\"doubtless takes something out of himself with his vagaries, but then there is such a lot to take!\\" Racing career =1904: two-year-old season= Lord Rosebery, who bred and owned Cicero Cicero was unbeaten in five races as a two-year-old. At the Craven meeting at Newmarket in April he won the Fitzwilliam Stakes, beating the King‚Äôs, horse Rosemarket who started favourite. Cicero beat Rosemarket again in the Woodcote Stakes at Epsom in June, this time as the even money favourite. He was then sent to Royal Ascot where he won the Coventry Stakes at Royal Ascot beating Vedas by two lengths. He won the July Stakes at Newmarket at the unusual odds of 1/20 and then carried 135lbs to victory in the valuable National Breeder's Produce Stakes at Sandown in mid July. He sustained an injury in the Sandown race and missed the rest of the season, but nevertheless went into the winter break as favourite for the Derby. =1905: three-year-old season= Cicero had not been entered in the 2000 Guineas, which was won by Vedas and instead made his debut in the Newmarket Stakes. He won easily from Llangibby and was made favourite for the Derby. Vedas was ruled out of the Derby by injury and at Epsom Cicero was sent off at odds of 4/11, making him one of the shortest- priced favourites in the race‚Äôs history. The second favourite was the French- trained Jardy, who was also undefeated, but reportedly suffering from a respiratory infection which had affected many of the horses in the stables of his owner, Edmond Blanc. Ridden by Danny Maher Cicero tracked the leaders in the early stages before making his challenge in the straight. Unable to find a run along the rails, Maher switched Cicero to the outside and took the lead only to be faced by the \\"strenuous challenges\\" of Jardy and Signorino. He ran on strongly under pressure to win after a \\"bitter struggle\\" by three quarters of a length from Jardy with Signorino a head further back in third. The winning time of 2:39.6 was a new race record. Lord Rosebery celebrated the victory in extravagant style with a firework display at The Durdans, followed by a ‚Äúlavish treat‚Äù for the four hundred inmates of the local workhouse and a garden party for three-thousand local \\"working men\\". On his next start Cicero attempted to defend his unbeaten record in the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown for which he started 8/13 favourite. His main rival was expected to be Val d'Or, a stable companion of Jardy and the winner of the Poule d'Essai des Poulains. Cicero took up the lead in the straight and was immediately challenged by the French colt. Maher rode a vigorous finish, but Val d'Or, who was receiving three pounds from Cicero, pulled ahead in the closing stages to win by a half a length. Cicero then developed leg problems and, although considered as a contender for the St Leger he did not appear the racecourse for the rest of the year. =1906: four-year-old season= On his four-year-old debut on 20 April 1906, Cicero carried 140 lbs to beat Shilfa, his only opponent, in the one and a half mile Biennial Stakes at Newmarket, recording a time of 2:32.8. He was then aimed at the Ascot Gold Cup, for which he started second favourite, but after racing in second, he faded badly and finished unplaced behind Bachelor's Button and Pretty Polly. On the advice of his trainer, Cicero was then retired. Assessment During his racing career, there was some disagreement about Cicero's merits: some considered him a \\"really great horse\\", while others felt that he was merely \\"the best of a moderate lot\\" of English colts. In their book A Century of Champions, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Cicero an ‚Äúaverage‚Äù Derby winner.Randall, J and Morris, T. Portway Press, 1999, p. 205 Stud career Cicero stood as a stallion at his owner‚Äôs studs at Mentmore, Buckinghamshire . He was a modest success, with his best offspring being the Prince of Wales's Stakes winner Friar Marcus. In 1921 his stud fee was 200 guineas. In 1923 he was retired from stud duties and moved back to his birthplace, The Durdans. Shortly after his arrival, however, Cicero had to be euthanized after suffering an intestinal rupture when cast in his box. He was buried at The Durdans.

He was active during the Crisis of the Roman Republic and Caesar's Civil War. He commanded troops at the battles of Oricum, Dyrrhachium and Thapsus. The last of these ended the war, in a defeat for the faction Torquatus supported; he escaped the field, but was captured and killed shortly after. He is portrayed by Cicero in De Finibus as a spokesman advocating Epicurean ethics. Biography =Early life= Torquatus was the son of Lucius Manlius Torquatus, and belonged to the patrician Manlii gens, one of the oldest Roman houses. In 69 BC he was elected a member of the Quindecimviri sacris faciundis, a senior religious collegium.Broughton, p. 134. In 66 BC he was the first to accuse newly elected consuls Publius Cornelius Sulla and Publius Autronius Paetus, the consul designates for the following year, of bribery in connection with the elections, thereby securing the election of his father in 65.Anthon & Smith, p. 903. Torquatus was closely aligned with Cicero, both strong supporters of the self described boni (good men). The boni were the traditionalist senatorial majority of the Roman Republic, politicians who believed that the role of the Senate was being usurped by the legislative people's assemblies for the benefit of a few power hungry individuals. The boni were against anyone who attempted to use these legislative assemblies to reform the state. As a fellow senator Torquatus supported Cicero during his praetorship in 66 BC and his tumultuous consulship in 63. After Cicero had beaten him to the consulship, the distinguished ex-general and military governor Lucius Sergius Catilina led a conspiracy centered on assassinating Cicero and overthrowing the Republic with the help of foreign armed forces. Three years earlier, Torquatus' father and Cicero had publicly supported Catilina when he was unsuccessfully prosecuted for corruption and abuse of office. Despite this, Torquatus vigorously supported the Senate's efforts, which resulted in them unmasking the conspirators, capturing and executing several. The following year Catilina, with what was left of his army, was cornered by three legions and killed. By this time, Torquatus and Cicero were on opposite sides. Torquatus accused Publius Cornelius Sulla of being a part of Catilina‚Äôs conspiracies.Anthon & Smith, p. 903; Holmes I, p. 445. Sulla had been an enemy for the four years since Torquatus had accused him of bribery, resulting in his being tried, convicted and, under the Lex Acilia Calpurnia, deprived of the consulship, being replaced by Torquatus' father, and expelled from the Senate.Cassius Dio, 36.44.3.Sallust, 18.2. Torquatus prosecuted Sulla for plotting the revenge killing of his father, while Cicero defended the accused. Torquatus accused Sulla of raising a force of armed men in 66 to secure the consulship for Catilina and murder the ruling consuls Lucius Manlius Torquatus, Torquatus' father, and Lucius Aurelius Cotta.Holmes I, p. 445. He also accused Cicero of manufacturing evidence.Holmes I, p. 482. This was the occasion for Cicero delivering his Pro Sulla speech. Sulla was acquitted, it being widely believed due to Cicero's skills of oratory. Sulla's brother, Servius, was not so fortunate, as Cicero refused his similar request to defend him.Cicero, Pro Sulla, 2. =Military career= In 50 the Senate, led by Pompey, ordered populist politician and general Julius Caesar to disband his army and return to Rome because his term as governor had ended.Suetonius, Julius 28. Caesar thought he would be prosecuted if he entered Rome without the immunity enjoyed by a magistrate. Torquatus was elected praetor (commander of a field army) for 49 and given command of six cohorts.Broughton, p. 256; Anthon & Smith, p. 903. On 10 January 49 Caesar crossed the Rubicon river, the boundary of Italy, and ignited Caesar's Civil War. He marched rapidly on Rome and captured it. Pompey, the boni and most of the Senate fled to Greece. Torquatus' soldiers went over to Caesar, but he decided to oppose Caesar and joined Pompey. The following year was appointed propraetor (military governor).Anthon & Smith, p. 903; Broughton, p. 276. Pompey put him in charge of the defence of Oricum. In January 48 Caesar landed nearby with six legions and marched on the port, which he urgently needed in order to supply his troops and to land reinforcements. Torquatus manned the walls with locally raised Illyrian soldiers and the town's Greek civilians. The locals and the garrison, afraid of the legions, opened the town's gate and allowed Caesar entry. Two of Pompey's lieutenants who were guarding merchant ships loaded with grain for Pompey's troops sank them with their warships to prevent them from falling into Caesar's hands. Torquatus surrendered to Caesar, who released him unharmed.Holmes III, p. 119‚Äì120; Anthon & Smith, p. 903. Roman controlled territory during Caesar's Civil War Caesar moved on Dyrrachium (modern Durr√´s, Albania), where Pompey had an arsenal. Pompey hurried to defend Dyrrachium and arrived first. He built a fortified camp south of the city, so Caesar started to build a circumvallation to besiege it. Six attempts to break through by Pompey were repulsed. Caesar's troops suffered food shortages while Pompey's were supplied by sea. However, Pompey held a limited amount of land and this created shortages of fodder for his animals. Water was also scarce because Caesar had diverted the local streams. Pompey needed to break the siege. Torquatus led part of Pompey's army in an attack on a weak spot in Caesar's fortifications and broke through. Mark Antony and Caesar rushed up reinforcements and pushed him back. However, this weakened other parts of Caesar's line and after heavy fighting his troops fled. Pompey did not pursue, but Caesar broke off the siege.Broughton, p. 276.Julius Caesar, The Civil War, 3.31‚Äì69. After much manoeuvring the two armies clashed at Pharsalus where Pompey was decisively defeated. Torquatus' role, if any, in this defeat is not known.Sheppard. Retaining his imperium, or power to command, Torquatus was in Africa in 47.Broughton, p. 289. There the surviving boni raised an army which included 40,000 men (about 8 legions), a powerful cavalry force led by Caesar's former right-hand man, the talented Titus Labienus, forces of allied local kings and 60 war elephants. The two armies engaged in small skirmishes to gauge the strength of the opposing force, during which two legions switched to Caesar's side. Meanwhile, Caesar expected reinforcements from Sicily. In the beginning of February 46, Caesar arrived in Thapsus and besieged the city. The boni, led by Metellus Scipio, could not risk the loss of this position and were forced to accept battle. Scipio commanded \\"without skill or success\\",Syme, p. 245. and Caesar won a crushing victory which ended the war. Torquatus fled the field along with Scipio, attempting to escape to Hispania, but was trapped at Hippo Regius by the fleet of Publius Sittius. Scipio committed suicide on board a ship and Torquatus either committed suicide with him or was captured and executed.Broughton, p. 296; Anthon & Smith, p. 903. =Epicurian= De finibus bonorum et malorum De finibus bonorum et malorum (On the ends of good and evil'De Finibus) is a philosophical work by the Roman orator, politician and philosopher Marcus Tullius Cicero. It consists of five books, in which Cicero explains the philosophical views of Epicureanism, Stoicism, and Platonism. Torquatus was a leading epicurean and was noted by Cicero for his knowledge of Greek literature and his breadth of learning. He was also a friend of Marcus Junius Brutus to whom the book was dedicated. (And who was shortly to be one of the assassins of Julius Caesar.) He was portrayed by Cicero in the first two books of De Finibus as a spokesman advocating Epicurean ethics.Anthon & Smith, p. 903.Yonge. The work was written in 45, after Torquatus' death, but the debate is set in 50.Yonge. Footnotes =References= * Anthon, Charles & Smith, William.

Neurons developed as specialized electrical signaling cells in multicellular animals, adapting the mechanism of action potentials present in motile single-celled and colonial eukaryotes. Simple nerve nets seen in animals like Cnidaria (jellyfish) evolved first, consisted of polymodal neurons which serve a dual purpose in motor and sensory functions. Cnidarians can be compared to Ctenophores (comb jellyfish), which although are both jellyfish, have very different nervous systems. Unlike Cnidarians, Ctenophores have neurons that use electrochemical signaling. This was perplexing because the phylum Ctenophora was considered to be more ancient than that of Porifera (sponges), which have no nervous system at all. This led to the rise of two theories which described how the early nervous system came about. One theory stated that the nervous system came about in an ancestor basal to all of these phylum, however was lost in Porifera. The other theory states that the nervous system arose independently twice, one basal to Cnidarians and one basal to Ctenophores. Bilateral animals ‚Äì ventral nerve cords in invertebrates and dorsal nerve cords supported by a notochord in chordates-- evolved with a central nervous system that was around a central region, a process known as cephalization. Neural precursors Action potentials, which are necessary for neural activity, evolved in single-celled eukaryotes. These use calcium rather than sodium action potentials, but the mechanism was probably adapted into neural electrical signaling in multicellular animals. In some colonial eukaryotes such as Obelia electrical signals do propagate not only through neural nets, but also through epithelial cells in the shared digestive system of the colony. Several non-metazoan phyla, including choanoflagellates, filasterea, and mesomycetozoea, have been found to have synaptic protein homologs, including secretory SNAREs, Shank, and Homer. In choanoflagellates and mesomycetozoea, these proteins are upregulated during colonial phases, suggesting the importance of these proto- synaptic proteins for cell to cell communication. The history of ideas on how neurons and the first nervous systems emerged in evolution has been discussed in a recent book. Sponges Sponges have no cells connected to each other by synaptic junctions, that is, no neurons, and therefore no nervous system. They do, however, have homologs of many genes that play key roles in synaptic function. Recent studies have shown that sponge cells express a group of proteins that cluster together to form a structure resembling a postsynaptic density (the signal-receiving part of a synapse). However, the function of this structure is currently unclear. Although sponge cells do not show synaptic transmission, they do communicate with each other via calcium waves and other impulses, which mediate some simple actions such as whole-body contraction. Nerve nets Jellyfish, comb jellies, and related animals have diffuse nerve nets rather than a central nervous system. In most jellyfish the nerve net is spread more or less evenly across the body; in comb jellies it is concentrated near the mouth. The nerve nets consist of sensory neurons that pick up chemical, tactile, and visual signals, motor neurons that can activate contractions of the body wall, and intermediate neurons that detect patterns of activity in the sensory neurons and send signals to groups of motor neurons as a result. In some cases groups of intermediate neurons are clustered into discrete ganglia. The development of the nervous system in radiata is relatively unstructured. Unlike bilaterians, radiata only have two primordial cell layers, endoderm and ectoderm. Neurons are generated from a special set of ectodermal precursor cells, which also serve as precursors for every other ectodermal cell type. Nerve cords Nervous system of a bilaterian animal, in the form of a nerve cord with a \\"brain\\" at the front The vast majority of existing animals are bilaterians, meaning animals with left and right sides that are approximate mirror images of each other. All bilateria are thought to have descended from a common wormlike ancestor that appeared in the Ediacaran period, 550‚Äì600 million years ago. The fundamental bilaterian body form is a tube with a hollow gut cavity running from mouth to anus, and a nerve cord with an especially large ganglion at the front, called the \\"brain\\". Area of the human body surface innervated by each spinal nerve Even mammals, including humans, show the segmented bilaterian body plan at the level of the nervous system. The spinal cord contains a series of segmental ganglia, each giving rise to motor and sensory nerves that innervate a portion of the body surface and underlying musculature. On the limbs, the layout of the innervation pattern is complex, but on the trunk it gives rise to a series of narrow bands. The top three segments belong to the brain, giving rise to the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. Bilaterians can be divided, based on events that occur very early in embryonic development, into two groups (superphyla) called protostomes and deuterostomes. Deuterostomes include vertebrates as well as echinoderms and hemichordates (mainly acorn worms). Protostomes, the more diverse group, include arthropods, molluscs, and numerous types of worms. There is a basic difference between the two groups in the placement of the nervous system within the body: protostomes possess a nerve cord on the ventral (usually bottom) side of the body, whereas in deuterostomes the nerve cord is on the dorsal (usually top) side. In fact, numerous aspects of the body are inverted between the two groups, including the expression patterns of several genes that show dorsal-to-ventral gradients. Some anatomists now consider that the bodies of protostomes and deuterostomes are \\"flipped over\\" with respect to each other, a hypothesis that was first proposed by Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire for insects in comparison to vertebrates. Thus insects, for example, have nerve cords that run along the ventral midline of the body, while all vertebrates have spinal cords that run along the dorsal midline. But recent molecular data from different protostomes and deuterostomes reject this scenario. = Annelida = Earthworms have dual nerve cords running along the length of the body and merging at the tail and the mouth. These nerve cords are connected by transverse nerves like the rungs of a ladder. These transverse nerves help coordinate the two sides of the animal. Two ganglia at the head end function similar to a simple brain. Photoreceptors on the animal's eyespots provide sensory information on light and dark. = Nematoda = The nervous system of one very small worm, the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans, has been mapped out down to the synaptic level. Every neuron and its cellular lineage has been recorded and most, if not all, of the neural connections are known. In this species, the nervous system is sexually dimorphic; the nervous systems of the two sexes, males and hermaphrodites, have different numbers of neurons and groups of neurons that perform sex-specific functions. In C. elegans, males have exactly 383 neurons, while hermaphrodites have exactly 302 neurons. =Arthropods= Internal anatomy of a spider, showing the nervous system in blue Arthropods, such as insects and crustaceans, have a nervous system made up of a series of ganglia, connected by a ventral nerve cord made up of two parallel connectives running along the length of the belly. Typically, each body segment has one ganglion on each side, though some ganglia are fused to form the brain and other large ganglia. The head segment contains the brain, also known as the supraesophageal ganglion. In the insect nervous system, the brain is anatomically divided into the protocerebrum, deutocerebrum, and tritocerebrum. Immediately behind the brain is the subesophageal ganglion, which is composed of three pairs of fused ganglia. It controls the mouthparts, the salivary glands and certain muscles. Many arthropods have well-developed sensory organs, including compound eyes for vision and antennae for olfaction and pheromone sensation. The sensory information from these organs is processed by the brain. In insects, many neurons have cell bodies that are positioned at the edge of the brain and are electrically passive‚Äîthe cell bodies serve only to provide metabolic support and do not participate in signalling. A protoplasmic fiber runs from the cell body and branches profusely, with some parts transmitting signals and other parts receiving signals. Thus, most parts of the insect brain have passive cell bodies arranged around the periphery, while the neural signal processing takes place in a tangle of protoplasmic fibers called neuropil, in the interior.Chapman, p. 546 Evolution of innate behaviors Behaviors such as the \\"tail-flip\\" escape reaction in crustacea such as crayfish and lobsters are fixed action patterns that may have evolved from earlier ancestral patterns. Evolution of central nervous systems =Evolution of the human brain= There has been a gradual increase in brain volume as the ancestors of modern humans progressed along the human timeline of evolution (see Homininae), starting from about 600 cm3 in Homo habilis up to 1736 cm3 in Homo neanderthalensis. Thus, in general there is a correlation between brain volume and intelligence. However, modern Homo sapiens have a smaller brain volume (brain size 1250 cm3) than neanderthals; women have a brain volume slightly smaller than men, and the Flores hominids (Homo floresiensis), nicknamed \\"hobbits\\", had a cranial capacity of about 380 cm3, about a third of the Homo erectus average and considered small for a chimpanzee. It is proposed that they evolved from H. erectus as a case of insular dwarfism. In spite of their threefold smaller brain there is evidence that H. floresiensis used fire and made stone tools as sophisticated as those of their proposed ancestor, H. erectus. Iain Davidson summarizes the opposite evolutionary constraints on human brain size as \\"As large as you need and as small as you can\\". Brain evolution can be studied using endocasts, a branch of neurology and paleontology called paleoneurology.

Red dot: Discovery Claim. Text saying all located shows that Klondikers were informed about claims already made.Chicago Records, p. 15 Gold rush era (1896~1899) During the gold rush some gold was found in the creek beds, but most was in the valley gravels near and in bedrock. The recovery had two steps: bringing the gravel containing gold to the surface and then separating the gold from the gravel using water and gravity separation, as a result access to water was important since it was necessary for the separation process and could also be used thawing the permanently frozen ground and washing down gravels from the upper terraces. Methods of bringing out the gold The first step of recovery was to bring the mixture of gold and dirt from the ground to the surface or from a hillside down to a bench. There were two methods: digging a shaft or using water under pressure to either wash down a hillside or suck up earth from the ground. =Underground mining= Most of the gold was below the surface. The miners first had to thaw the permafrost before they could dig. A fire burning all night was used to soften the ground. This would then thaw to a depth of about 14 inches and the gravel could be removed. The process was repeated until the gold was reached. No support of the shaft was necessary because of the permafrost. However, the fire could produce noxious gas which had to be removed. Over time steam for thawing the ground were also taken into use. Normally digging was done during the winter. The cold air would sink down into the shaft and renew the air automatically. At the same time the temperature meant that shafts, apart from not needing support, were not at risk of being filled with water. A dump was made that could be sluiced during the summer. In the dump, the gold was protected from theft because it was invisible in frozen gravel.Information Sharing During the Klondike Gold Rush. p. 11-12 Miningsteam.jpgPrinciples of mining with steam Thawing-eldorado-creek-1898.jpgThawing ground with steam, 1898 Miningshafttech.jpgPrinciples of mining with shaft Shaft- pile.jpgSteam plant, sluice and dump, Hunker, ca. 1901 =Hydraulic methods and mining in benches= Jets were applied to wash down part of a hillside for sluicing.GeoWeb The stream could be so strong that it would reflect a crowbar swung at it.Sierra College Press, Monitors When gravity could not be used for sluicing, a lift could be applied; it used pressurized water, introduced at the bottom, to suck up a mixture of water and gravel.Manson Creek historic society, hydraulic mining This could also be an alternative to shaft mining as seen on picture 2.

Panning for gold was the simplest method of recovering gold, but mostly used for prospecting since it was slow. A faster way was by a rocker box or by sluicing. Dirt was filled into the box or sluice together with water and rocking movements or gravity would make the gold particle go to the bottom whereas sand and fine gold particles would flow off with the water. Further purification of the gold could be done with mercury that would amalgamate with gold only and leave fine sand particles out. A magnet could be used to separate fine magnetic sand from gold dust.

In 1988, she was awarded the David di Donatello for her starring turn in Nikita Mikhalkov's film Dark Eyes. Biography =Early life and education= Yelena Safonova was born on 14 June 1956 in Leningrad, the daughter of the famous Soviet actor Vsevolod Safonov and the film director Valeriya Ivanovna Rublyova who worked at Mosfilm. In the mid-1960s, the family moved to Moscow, where Yelena attended a special secondary school and studied French to an advanced level. In 1973 she graduated from Moscow Secondary School No. 37. At her third attempt, she was accepted by the Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography to study acting. In between her entrance exams, she earned income as a librarian. After studying at the Film Institute for two years she returned to Leningrad, where she would graduate in 1981 from the Leningrad Institute of Theatre, Music and Cinematography (under Ruben Agamirzyan). In the same year she became an actress at the Komissarzhevskaya Theatre, where she worked for one season. She made her debut in cinema in 1974, in the role of Lyuba in the film Looking for my destiny. =Career= Safonova's first major film role was as Solomiya Krushelnytska in the biographical picture The Return of Butterfly (1983). Safonova became a household name in Russia with the role of the 30-year-old divorcee Olga in the romantic comedy Winter Cherry (1985) by Igor Maslennikov. She acted in another picture by the same director, The Twentieth Century Approaches, which was Maslennikov's last Sherlock Holmes adaptation. Since 1986, the actress has worked with the Russian film studio Mosfilm. In 1987 Yelena starred opposite Marcello Mastroianni in the romantic drama Dark Eyes by director Nikita Mikhalkov.

(U.K.). The point in issue was whether Quebec had the constitutional authority to create a mandatory inquiry power for provincial fire commissioners. The case was ultimately decided by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, at that time the court of last resort for Canada within the British Empire. It was the first decision by the Judicial Committee analysing the division of powers under the Constitution of Canada. The Judicial Committee held that the mandatory inquiry power was within provincial authority. The Judicial Committee also held that evidence given by an individual in response to a mandatory inquiry could later be used as evidence against that individual in a criminal prosecution for arson.  Facts  In 1871, there was a fire in the warehouse owned by the accused, Edward Coote, in Montreal, Quebec. Fire commissioners appointed under provincial law investigated the fire. In the course of their investigation, they twice interrogated Mr. Coote. Under the authority granted by provincial law, Mr. Coote was required to respond to the questions of the fire commissioners. Subsequently, Mr. Coote was charged with four counts of arson with intent to defraud various insurance companies. He was tried before a single judge of the Quebec Court of Queen's Bench, sitting with a jury. The Crown successfully entered the two depositions in evidence. The jury convicted Mr. Coote. The trial judge reserved questions of law for the full Court to consider, including the validity of the provincial statute and the admissibility of the depositions in evidence against the accused.R v Coote, pp. 604-605 (L.R.), pp. 1-2 (UKPC).  Decision of the Quebec Court of Queen's Bench  On 15 March 1872, the Quebec Court of Queen's Bench allowed the accused's appeal in a 3-2 decision. The majority held that while the provincial statute in question was within the constitutional authority of the Province, the depositions could not be admitted in the criminal trial. The Court quashed the guilty verdict.R v Coote, p. 601 (L.R.).  Decision of the Judicial Committee  The Crown appealed from the Quebec Queen's Bench to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, sitting in London. (The Supreme Court of Canada had not yet been created.) As the accused did not appear by counsel, the Committee heard the case ex parte on 11 March 1873. The appellant Crown was represented by Sir John Karslake, Q.C., and H.M. Bompas.R. v. Coote, p. 602 (L.R.). The Committee gave its decision on 18 March 1873, allowing the Crown appeal. Sir Robert P. Collier gave the decision for the Committee. He briefly disposed of the constitutional issue, referring to the lower court's conclusion that the law was within provincial jurisdiction and stating that the Committee agreed with that ruling.R v Coote, p. 605 (L.R.), p. 2 (UKPC). The main focus of his decision was on the issue of the admissibility of the two depositions in the subsequent criminal trial. He concluded that \\"the depositions on Oath of a Witness legally taken are evidence against him, should he be subsequently tried on a criminal charge\\", except for questions which the witness had objected to answering.R v Coote, p. 607 (L.R.), p. 4 (UKPC). He also concluded that the fire commissioners did not have any duty to warn Mr Coote of his right to have counsel present, since they had not arrested him at the time of the questioning.R v Coote, p. 608 (L.R.), p. 5 (UKPC). As a result, the Committee advised Her Majesty that the appeal should be allowed, that the conviction at trial be affirmed and that the Quebec Court of Queen's Bench pass sentence on Mr Coote.  Significance  R. v. Coote was the first case which considered (albeit very briefly) the constitutional division of powers under the Constitution Act, 1867. The federal Department of Justice included this decision in the three volume collection of constitutional decisions of the Judicial Committee which the Department published when appeals to the Judicial Committee were abolished.Richard A. Olmsted, Q.C. (ed.), Decisions of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council relating to the British North America Act, 1867 and the Canadian Constitution, 1867-1954, vol. I, p. 1 (Ottawa: Queen's Printer and Controller of Stationery, 1954). The Supreme Court of Canada continues to cite the Coote case with approval, for the proposition that the provinces have the constitutional authority to enact legislation creating public inquiries with the power to compel testimony from witnesses.Attorney General of Quebec and Keable v.

The hosting venue was the Brisbane Convention & Exhibition Centre at South Brisbane. The event was the largest ever peacetime police operation in Australia. On 1 December 2013 Brisbane became the official host city for the G20. The City of Brisbane had a public holiday on 14 November 2014. Up to 4,000 delegates were expected to attend with around 2,500 media representatives. The leaders of Mauritania, Myanmar, New Zealand, Senegal, Singapore, and Spain were also invited to this summit.  Agenda  European leaders expressed their desire to support the recovery as the global economy moves beyond the global financial crisis. European Commission President Barroso and European Council President Van Rompuy stressed the importance of coordinated growth strategies as well as finalising agreements on core financial reforms, and actions on tax and anti-corruption. According to Waheguru Pal Singh Sidhu the main objectives of the summit were to \\"provide strategic priority for growth, financial rebalancing and emerging economies, investment and infrastructure, and employment and labour mobility\\". Professor of international finance law at the University of New South Wales Ross Buckley suggested that the summit should have emphasised the implementation of existing strategies rather than seeking agreement towards reforms. Climate change was not included as a subject for discussion at the summit; Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott stated he did not want the agenda \\"cluttered\\" by subjects that would distract from economic growth. Officials from the European Union and United States of America were reported to be unhappy with this decision. At each of the previous summits climate change was included on the agenda. The Australian media stated that Australia will have had a significant effect on the agenda. Mike Callaghan, the director of the G20 Studies Centre at the Lowy Institute for International Policy has stated that if the G20 meeting was to attain significant outcomes it should focus on boosting infrastructure spending, multilateral trading systems and combating base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS). The discussion on tax avoidance had been fuelled by a disclosure of confidential tax agreements between more than 340 multinational corporations and Luxembourg (see also Luxembourg Leaks).BBC, Australia examines global firms' Luxembourg tax deals Sydney Morning Herald, G20 leaders in the mood to act on tax avoidance after Luxembourg leaks Preparations The G20 leaders wave on the final day of the forum At the 2011 G20 Cannes summit, Then-Prime Minister Julia Gillard was asked to have Australia host the 2014 summit. Brisbane was selected over Sydney because the city was better equipped to cater for a significant increase in plane arrivals and the Sydney Convention and Exhibition Centre would be undertaking renovations at the time. The Parliament of Queensland passed the G20 (Safety and Security) Act 2013 on 29 October 2013. The event involved a complex security operation. Event organisers needed to ensure that appropriate security measures were in place to protect visitors, while minimising disruptions to inner-city residents and businesses. About 6,000 police from Queensland, wider Australia and New Zealand ensured security at the event, and more than 600 volunteers provided assistance at the summit. Roads between the central business district and the Brisbane Airport were temporarily closed. Around 1,500 security specialists including interstate and overseas personnel together with thousands of Queensland police made patrols. Public transport services were reduced in the central business district and surrounding suburbs. One wing in a major Brisbane hospital was reserved for the exclusive use of world leaders during the summit. A secure, government wireless network was required for public safety communications during the summit. Telstra established the network in Brisbane, the Gold Coast and Cairns before the event and later continued rolling it out across South East Queensland. The Australian Government rented 16 bombproof Mercedes Benz S-Guard limousines specially for the summit at a cost of AU$1.8 million. Some world leaders however, including Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin planned to bring their own vehicles. 800 people were involved in a security exercise, which tested responses to security issues, crowd management and transport for over 10 hours on 6 October 2014. Actors portraying delegates were used, which involved a mock world leader arriving from a Qantas Boeing 737-800 at Brisbane International Airport into a 13-vehicle motorcade consisting of police motorbikes, police cars, sedans, vans, an SUV and a ute, which travelled from the airport to a Brisbane hotel. The cost of hosting the event was estimated at around AU$400 million. Associated meetings G20 finance ministers and central bank governors met several times in 2014. Sydney hosted a meeting on 21‚Äì23 February 2014 followed by a meeting in Cairns, Queensland in September 2014. At the September meeting participating countries agreed to automatically exchange tax information to reduce tax evasion. Canberra hosted a meeting for G20 finance and central bank deputies in 2014. The Youth 20 Summit was the official G20 youth event held in Sydney in July 2014. A meeting of G20 trade ministers took place in Sydney during July, and the annual G20 Labour and Employment Ministerial Meeting was held in Melbourne during September. Officials-levels meetings of public servants took place throughout the year to prepare for the ministerial meetings.  Security measures  Police boats patrolling the Brisbane River on the day before the summit A declared area took effect from 8 November with several restricted areas which were to be fenced and guarded by police.Queensland Police G20 Maps list Freedom of movement for ordinary citizens was restricted. According to the G20 (Safety and Security) Regulation 2014 and article 12 of the G20 (Safety and Security) Act 2013,G20 Bill at legislation QLD residents living in these areas had to have a security clearance performed, and their car given a security pass. Residents not receiving a security clearance were forced to leave the area, but were paid accommodation expenses. The G20 legislation suspended important civil liberties, including the absolute right to arrest without warrant, in addition to the Police Powers Act 2000, to detain people without charge, to predispose the courts into not giving arrested individuals bail, extensive searches of the person without warrant,.Queensland Police G20 FAQ website Officers had the backing of increased penalties when lawful directions are not followed. The Peaceful Assembly Act of 1992 was suspended during the G20 meeting dates. Size of placards were strictly regulated, as was permission to protest, and the location of protests.

Issues involving Russia Opinion was divided both in Australia and elsewhere on whether Russian President Vladimir Putin should have been allowed to attend the G20 summit, following Russia's response to Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 being shot down as well as pro-Russian actions in Ukraine earlier in the year. Australia's foreign minister, Julie Bishop, approached other G20 countries about banning Putin from the meeting, and stated that this consultation found that there was not the necessary consensus to exclude him. A poll taken in July 2014 found 49% of Australians did not think Putin should be allowed to attend. It was confirmed in September that Putin would attend, with Abbott stating that \\"The G20 is an international gathering that operates by consensus ‚Äì it's not Australia's right to say yes or no to individual members of the G20\\". In November 2014, Russia sent a fleet of warships into international waters off the coast of Australia to accompany Putin's visit. The fleet consisted of Varyag, Marshal Shaposhnikov, a salvage and rescue tug, and a replenishment oiler. Australia responded by sending and , as well as a P-3 Orion surveillance plane, to monitor the Russians.Russian warships near Australia . . Retrieved 14 November 2014. Although Russia had previously sent warships to accompany presidential attendance at international summits, the size of fleet and the lack of official notification to the host country made this an unprecedented move. At the private leaders' retreat, held shortly before the official opening of the summit, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper told Russian President Vladimir Putin \\"I guess I'll shake your hand but I have only one thing to say to you: You need to get out of Ukraine.\\" The incident occurred as Putin approached Harper and a group of G20 leaders and extended his hand toward Harper. After the event was over, a spokesman for the Russian delegation said Putin's response was: \\"That's impossible because we are not there.\\" Participating leaders File:Ak cong 006.jpg Argentina Axel Kicillof, Minister of Economy File:Tony Abbott June 2014 Crop.jpg Australia Tony Abbott, Prime Minister (Host) File:Dilma Rousseff - foto oficial 2011-01-09.jpg Brazil Dilma Rousseff, President File:Stephen-Harper-Cropped-2014-02-18.jpg Canada Stephen Harper, Prime Minister File:Xi_Jinping_2016.jpg' Xi Jinping, President File:Francois Hollande 2015.jpeg France Fran√ßois Hollande, President File:Angela Merkel - Juli 2010 - 3zu4 cropped.jpg Germany Angela Merkel, Chancellor File:PM Modi 2015.jpg India Narendra Modi, Prime Minister File:Joko Widodo 2014 official portrait.jpg Indonesia Joko Widodo, President File:Matteo Renzi Portrait.png Italy Matteo Renzi, Prime Minister File:Shinz≈ç Abe Official.jpg Japan Shinz≈ç Abe, Prime Minister File:Enrique Pe√±a Nieto (Guatemala).jpg Mexico Enrique Pe√±a Nieto, President File:Vladimir Putin - 2006.jpg Russia Vladimir Putin, President File:Prince Salman bin Abd al-Aziz Al Saud at the Pentagon April 2012.jpg Saudi Arabia Salman, Crown Prince File:Jacob G.

The conference was hosted by Germany and chaired by Afghanistan. At the NATO Summit in Lisbon in November 2010, Afghanistan‚Äôs President Hamid Karzai had asked Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to host a follow-up conference ten years after the 2001 Bonn Conference. In order to prepare the second Bonn Conference, the Afghan Government worked in collaboration with the International Contact Group on Afghanistan, which consists of the Special Representatives on Afghanistan of 50 states. The Contact Group was headed by the German Special Representative Michael Steiner, and the German diplomat Holger Ziegeler was appointed conference coordinator. The conference, which was attended by 85 states, 15 international organizations and the United Nations, focused on three main issues involving the conclusion of the Afghan War and the transition of security responsibility to the Afghan Government, scheduled to occur in 2014. These were: civil aspects of the transition process, the role of international community in Afghanistan after the handover, and long-term political stabilization of the country. The conference concluded by issuing a statement affirming continued international support for Afghanistan for the next decade. Progress was hindered by Pakistan's boycott of the conference following the 2011 NATO attack in Pakistan. Participants Delegations from 85 states, 15 international organizations and the United Nations attended the conference. Pakistan withdrew from participation Bonn Conference due to a NATO airstrike with its territory on November 26, 2011 that resulted in the deaths of 26 Pakistani soldiers. Prior to the conference, Afghanistan had said that the purpose of conference would be hampered if Pakistan did not attend the conference and encouraged the United States to do everything it could to assure the Pakistani participation. In June 2011 there were speculations that the conference could mark formal start of Afghan peace process and that representatives of the Taliban might be invited to attend the conference.Bonn conference could mark formal start of Afghan peace process, Julien Borger, 20 Juni 2011 However, the Taliban said they would not be represented at the upcoming Bonn Conference; Taliban Leader Mullah Mohammad Omar said in an Eid message that the conference was symbolic and the Taliban would not participate in it.Istanbul and Bonn Conferences: Building Blocks of the Afghan Transition Process, United States Institute of Peace, 20 September 2011 Ultimately, the speculated invitation was not extended. Proceedings At the 66th UN General Assembly President Hamid Karzai's statement delivered by Foreign Minister Dr. Zalmai Rassoul said that the conference would also be an opportunity for Afghanistan to \\"share our vision for the next ten years ‚Äì the vision of developing Afghanistan into a stable country, a functioning democracy, and a prospering economy\\".President Hamid Karzai statement to 66th UN General Assembly delivered by Foreign Minister Dr. Zalmai Rassoul, 22 September 2011 The conference focused on three main areas:http://www.auswaertiges- amt.de/EN/Aussenpolitik/RegionaleSchwerpunkte/AfghanistanZentralasien/Bonn_Konferenz_2011/Bonn- Konferenz-Einstieg-node.html * Civil aspects of the transition process, the transfer of responsibility for security to the Afghan Government by 2014 * Long-term engagement of the international community and further international commitment to Afghanistan after the handover * Political process that should lead to a long-term stabilization of the country, i.e. national reconciliation and the integration of former Taliban fighters According to Miriam Safi of the Kabul-based Centre for Conflict and Peace Studies, Afghanistan's goal for the conference was to ensure donor support for Afghanistan beyond 2014. Afghanistan had originally intended the conference to serve as a showcase for diplomatic efforts at achieving Afghan-Taliban reconciliation, but negotiations broke down before the conference, and no Taliban delegate was present. Pakistan's withdrawal from the conference also hindered discussion of the Taliban issue, since Pakistan's support is considered to be vital for any Afghan-Taliban agreement. Hamid Karzai began the conference with an opening speech in which he stressed the need for regional cooperation, international aid, and military training. Following this, discussion concentrated on the issue of international aid, with Afghanistan indicating that it would require $10 billion per year for the next ten years in order to sustain security and reconstruction efforts. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton pledged continued US support but cited economic difficulties at home as a possible limiting factor and urged Afghanistan to reduce corruption in order avoid repelling potential foreign aid donors. Karzai promised to fight corruption by reforming Afghan institutions and the electoral process and extending the rule of law. The conference ended by releasing a set of Conference Conclusions affirming the commitment of the international community to continued support for Afghanistan after 2014. Reactions to the document were mixed, with some ridiculing their overly vague nature, although the conference was hailed by the Tehran Times as \\"a very good opportunity to help create a brighter future for Afghanistan.\\" See also * Bonn conference 2001 * Bonn Agreement (Afghanistan) * Politics of Afghanistan * List of international conferences on Afghanistan References External links * German Federal Foreign Office ‚Äî International Conference on Afghanistan (2011) * German Federal Foreign Office ‚Äî Conference Conclusions Category:Diplomatic conferences in Germany International Conference on Afghanistan 2011 Category:2011 in Afghanistan Category:2011 in Germany Category:21st-century diplomatic conferences Category:2011 in international relations Category:History of Bonn Category:2011 NATO attack in Pakistan Category:December 2011 events Category:21st century in Bonn ","title":"International Conference on Afghanistan, Bonn (2011)"},{"id":"33645486","text":"Matthias Bachinger was the defending champion but decided not to participate.

Listed at , 112 lb, she batted and threw right-handed. Dorothy Naum played many different positions during her eight seasons in the league. Originally a catcher, she later was moved to the middle infield positions before emerging as a solid starting pitcher. Though her fastball was fairly tepid, she had good control of her curveball and changeup. She led all pitchers for the best earned run average in 1951, and helped her team reach the postseason in 1953. Overall, she posted a 27‚Äì19 record in four seasons, while her 2.01 ERA is one of the lowest in league's history.All- American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book ‚Äì W. C. Madden.

She learned fundamentals of baseball from her two brothers at an early age, but did not begin playing softball until she was a 12-year-old young girl. At 18, her team's coach advised her to try out as a catcher, because the league did not have enough good ones. Nevertheless, Naum admittedly was not strong enough to be a good hitter.The Women of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League: A Biographical Dictionary ‚Äì W. C. Madden. Publisher: McFarland & Company, 2005. Format: Paperback, 295 pp. Language: English. She entered the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League in 1946 with the South Bend Blue Sox, playing for them one year before joining the Kenosha Comets (1947‚Äì1951) and Kalamazoo Lassies (1952‚Äì1953). In her first four seasons, Naum had modest hitting numbers, by compiling averages of .194 (1946), .207 (1947), .174 (1948) and .157 (1949). Then in 1950 with Kenosha, Naum was used periodically as a pitcher, which earned her a spot in the rotation. She responded with a 6‚Äì4 record and a 2.39 ERA in 19 games. She had an even better season for the Comets in 1951, when she was 5‚Äì4 and led the league with a 1.14 ERA. In 1953, Naum topped the Kalamazoo staff with a 14‚Äì7 record, while her 2.18 ERA was surpassed only by her teammate Gloria Cordes (1.98), helping Kalamazoo reach the postseason to face the Fort Wayne Daisies in a best-of-three series. Following a twelve-inning 3‚Äì1 defeat to Maxine Kline and the Daisies in Game 1, Naum was selected to start Game 2. Going in the ninth inning, the Lassies were down 1‚Äì0 in their last at bat. Naum stepped up to the plate and helped herself after hitting a home run over the fence to tie the game at 1‚Äì1. It was the first and last home run Naum hit in 1628 career AAGPBL at bats, including the postseason. She then set down Fort Wayne in the bottom of the ninth to force the extra innings. In the top of 10th inning, Jean Lovell singled in the winning run in the 10th, Naum retired the side in the bottom and was credited with a 2‚Äì1 victory in a complete 10-inning game. In Game 3, Kalamazoo won over Fort Wayne, 5‚Äì3, behind strong pitching from Kay Blumetta and two RBI from Lovell, and advanced to the best-of-three final series. Finally, Kalamazoo was defeated in two games by the Grand Rapids Chicks. Following the 1953 season, Naum married Ron Parker, who was going to allow her to play the final season of the league, but she became pregnant with her first child instead. The couple had two sons, Craig and Robert, and two granddaughters. Ron died in 1995, after 42 years of marriage. A resident of Galesburg, Illinois since 1958, Dorothy Naum Parker was a member of the All- American Girls Professional Baseball League, which was honored with a permanent display unveiled at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York in October 1988. In her spare time, Dorothy was an avid golfer .

Biography and career Founded by cellist Frank Sumner Dodge in 1988, Spectrum Concerts Berlin is a chamber ensemble that performs music from the baroque and classical periods as well as 20th century and contemporary chamber music. The ensemble features a number of musicians, including Janine Jansen, Boris Brovtsyn, Robert D. Levin, Eldar Nebolsin, Maxim Rysanov, Clara-Jumi Kang, Torleif Thed√©en, Alexander Sitkovetsky, Jens Peter Maintz and many others.http://www.spectrumconcerts.com/index.php?id=7&L;=1 A sister group, Spectrum Concerts Berlin-USA, Inc., was founded in New York City in 2005 for the purpose of extending the work of the ensemble. Spectrum Concerts Berlin- USA, Inc. opened with two concerts in November 2006 at Zankel Hall, in Carnegie Hall. Reviewers have showered praise for years, both in reviews of their live performances at the Philharmonie/Kammermusiksaal, and of their recordings. The Vision A century ago America and Europe were united by strong bonds of musical appreciation. Separated after two wars, these important cultures can be significantly re-connected through the shared experience of high-level chamber music. Music is a medium of powerful and direct communication, which can create moments of profound understanding, and insights that are beyond the power of words. Chamber music, so-called from the smaller spaces and numbers of performers typically involved, provides an especially intimate and compelling musical experience. The Mission Founded in 1988 by Frank Dodge, an American cellist living in Germany, Spectrum Concerts Berlin has become well established and widely acclaimed in its native city. Presentation of music by contemporary American composers has been an integral and important part of its presence. Two American Music Weeks hosted in 1990 and 2000 by high-level political and cultural figures were enhanced by lectures and art exhibitions. Highly praised CD‚Äôs have made the group‚Äôs work available worldwide. Spectrum Concerts Berlin has also organized programs for European music students including two visits to the USA. With the wide acceptance in Berlin, Spectrum Concerts Berlin ‚Äì USA, Inc., Expanding the Language of Chamber Music has been organized to extend the work of Spectrum Concerts Berlin ‚Äì performances by the professional ensemble, master classes and related cultural experiences. Spectrum Concerts Berlin has recorded extensively for the Naxos label, including three albums devoted to the chamber music of Ernst Toch, two to Robert Helps as well as Erno von Dohn√°nyi, John Harbison, Paul Hindemith, Stanley Walden, Ursula Mamlok, Anton Arensky, Erwin Schulhoff, in 2020 Wolfgang Korngold and in 2021 B√©la Bart√≥k and Sergei Taneyev. Additional recordings include an album on New World Records (originally CRI) devoted to new chamber and solo music of David Del Tredici, Robert Helps, Jan Radzynski and Tison Street, the piano quartets of Johannes Brahms co-produced by Sender Freies Berlin (now rbb kultur) in 2000.

Facts  Pursuant to a default judgment against Markom, the first respondent, his residential property was sold in execution to Menqa, the first appellant (who subsequently sold it to the second appellant). The warrant of execution had been issued by the clerk of the magistrates' court without judicial supervision, but prior to the ruling in Jaftha v Schoeman; Van Rooyen v Stoltz,2005 (2) SA 140 (CC). wherein the Constitutional Court declared unconstitutional the relevant provision in the Magistrates' Courts ActAct 32 of 1944.s 66(1)(a). and ordered its amendment. Menqa, therefore, had acted in good faith, having not knowledge at the time of the defect in the warrant. In the Cape Provincial Division, however, Zondi AJ held that the sale in execution, along with all subsequent sales, was nonetheless null and void, since it might compromise Markom's right in the Constitution of access to adequate housing.s 26(1). Jaftha was therefore applied retrospectively, and the court a quo directed the Registrar of Deeds to reregister Markom as owner of the property.  Judgment  On appeal, the SCA agreed that sales in execution of immovable property, as well as all subsequent sales, were invalid if the warrant of execution had been issued by the magistrates' clerk without judicial supervision. The absence of this procedural safeguard would imperil a party's constitutional rights,s 26(1). even if the warrant was issued before Jaftha, and could not be saved by an application of the Magistrates' Courts Act.s 70. The court also held that, if a sale in execution was null and void because it violated the principle of legality, the sheriff had no authority to transfer ownership to the purchaser, who would therefore not acquire ownership, despite registration of the property in his or her name. On the facts, Markom was theoretically entitled to recover the property in vindicatory proceedings.129G-130D. The court held further, on the facts, that directing the Registrar of Deeds to reregister the property in Markom's name would not take into account * what Menqa had paid for the property; and * Markom's possible unjustified enrichment.130E. The decision of the court a quo was thus confirmed in part and reversed in part. In a concurring judgment, Cloete JA found that, at common law, a sale in execution was void for want of compliance with an essential formality, but that non-compliance with non-essential formalities did not have this result. His view was that section 70 of the Magistrates' Courts Act should be interpreted as being to the same effect as the common law, except that a sale in execution in a magistrates' court could be impugned even for want of non- essential formalities where the purchaser did not act in good faith or had notice of the non-compliance. Furthermore, section 70 should not be interpreted as protecting a sale which is void, as this conflicts with the basic principle of legality, as well as the Constitution.s 25.

It was reintroduced on 1 July 2005 and is the second-largest denomination coin in Romania. In addition to Romania, it has been minted in the United Kingdom (1867), Belgium (1900, 1905-1906), Germany (1906) and Russia (1952). History =Principality of Romania= Both sides of a Watt & Co. ten-bani coin minted in 1867 for the Principality of Romania The first ten-bani coin was struck in 1867 by two different mints in Birmingham, England: Heaton and Watt & Co. The coin measured 30mm in diameter and weighed 10g. It was composed of 95% copper, 4% tin and 1% zinc. The obverse featured the name of the country and its coat of arms. The reverse featured the denomination within a laurel branch and oak branch. The denomination within the wreath read 10 BANI and 1867. Each mint struck 12.5 million of the coin. Watt & Co. used the mintmark WATT & Co below the wreath while Heaton used one of HEATON. The coins entered circulation on 1 January 1868.http://romaniancoins.org/10bani1867.html =Kingdom of Romania= A second ten-bani coin was struck only in 1900, in Brussels, Belgium. It measured 19mm in diameter and weighed 3.5g. It was made of 75% copper and 25% nickel. Its obverse featured the crown of Romania above the date within a wreath of a laurel branch and oak branch. The reverse featured the denomination and name of the country. A total of 15 million were issued.http://romaniancoins.org/10bani1900.html The third ten-bani coin entered circulation in 1905 and also saw issue the following year. Although the same diameter and composition, it weighed 0.5g less (4g) due to a hole through the centre. On the obverse, the crown was placed above the hole and the name of the country was written on a scroll underneath. The reverse featured the denomination at the top, a rose on each side of the middle and the year at the bottom. The coins were designed by Anton Scharff, chief engraver at the Austrian Mint in Vienna. The 10.82 million coins of 1905 were minted exclusively at Brussels while in 1906 17 million from Hamburg, Germany supplemented 24.18 million from Brussels. The Hamburg-struck coins feature a 'J' mintmark below the scroll on the obverse while those of Brussels are without a mintmark.http://romaniancoins.org/10bani1905.html =People's Republic of Romania= The denomination returned in 1952 under communist rule. The new coin was 17.5mm in diameter and weighed 1.8g. It was composed of 80% copper and 10%% aluminium. The obverse featured Romania's communist coat of arms with the inscription around of REPUBLICA POPULARA ROMANA (Romanian People's Republic). The reverse had the denomination and year in plain type in an oak wreath. The coin was struck in Moscow in Soviet Russia and 37.9 million were issued in 1952.http://romaniancoins.org/10bani1952.html In 1953 a star was added to the top of the coat of arms to make them similar to those of other communist nations and minting switched to Bucharest, Romania's capital, which produced 1.6 million. While the weight remained the same, 0.5mm was taken off the diameter.http://romaniancoins.org/10bani1954.html The coins minted in 1955 and 1956 were 17.5mm, and the inscription used the word ROMINA instead of ROMANA. In 1955 4.1 million were minted and the following year 18.4 million.http://romaniancoins.org/10bani1955.html =Post-People's Republic= In the Socialist Republic of Romania (proclaimed 1965) ten-bani coins were replaced with fifteen-bani coins. Following the return of democracy to Romania in 1990, hyperinflation took place which made bani coins obsolete. However, on 1 July 2005, Romania redenominated its currency at 10,000 old lei to 1 new leu. The 1,000 lei coin, in use since 2000, was replaced by the new ten-bani. Early issues of the coin, from its first year 2005, have a diameter 0.1mm narrower than the official measurements.http://worldcoingallery.com/countries/display.php?image=img13/148-10b05&desc;=Romania km191 10 Bani (2005) 20.4mm&query;=Romania  References  Category:Coins of Romania Category:Ten-cent coins ","title":"Ten bani"},{"id":"33645545","text":"Eva Badura-Skoda (n√©e Halfar, born January 15, 1929) is a German/Austrian musicologist.Eva Badura-Skoda, \\"Badura-Skoda, Eva\\", Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart, Personenteil, vol. 1, ed.

He was the first person to be inducted into both the United States Harness Racing Hall of Fame and its Communicator's Hall of Fame. Bergstein died on November 2, 2011 after suffering from health problems for a year. He died only nine months after he retired as vice president. He is survived by his two children, Al and Lisa and four grandsons. His wife, June, died in 2010, four days after their 60th wedding anniversary. Born above a grocery store in Pottsville, Pennsylvania, to the grocer Milton and his wife Esther, on 19 June 1924 and died in his home in Tucson, Arizona on 2 November 2011 at the age of 87.

Served in WWII landing on Omaha Beach a few days after DDay. Fought across Normandy with Patton's Army. Fought in the Battle of the Bulge. Was injured and received the Purple Heart. After returning from the war, graduated from Northwestern's Medill School of Journalism. Worked in public relations for a variety of harness racing tracks in the 1940s. Also spent time as announcer and car driver, PR and other activities with the Harlem Globetrotters from approximately 1948 to 1952. Married the model June Hanna in 1950. They had a son Alfred (b. 1953) and daughter, Lisa (b.1956). In 1961 he helped create Harness Tracks of America, a trade group representing race track owners. He originally held the title of Executive Secretary, but also ran day to day operations for the organization. He held both that position and that of Executive Vice President until his retirement in February 2011, at which time he took the position of President Emeritus. In 1968, he additionally joined, as the vice president of publicity and public relations, the U.S. Trotting Association, the governing body of the standardbred sport. He also became editor of the USTA's award-winning monthly magazine, HoofBeats. In the 1950s, he worked as an announcer at many race tracks around America, including Sportsman's Part and Maywood Park in Chicago, Santa Anita in Los Angeles, and numerous other tracks. He also appeared on television as both color commentator and announcer for such premiere race events as The Little Brown Jug, and The Hambeltonian, later in his career. Bergstein was also a reader of horse pedigrees, which is a specialized skill requiring a knowledge of horse lineage. He was hired by major auctioneers, such as the late George Swinebroad and others, at the fall sales events in Lexington, Kentucky; Harrisburg Pennsylvania and other locations. Eventually he became a certified auctioneer, and ran his own sales for a couple of years in the 1970s. He also ran a small bookstore specializing in harness horse books and magazines, out of his home, eventually compiling one of the largest private collections of books on the subject, according to Stan's knowledge of other booksellers and private collectors. He sold the bulk of the library in the 1980s to a buyer from Sweden. In the 1970s and into the 1980s he was co-anchor on a television show on WOR-TV in New York City, broadcasting harness racing in conjunction with the State's then new Off Track Betting industry. He ended his working relationship with USTA in the mid-1970s, but remained a close business associate with the organization until his death. In the 1970s he created the \\"World Driving Championship\\", yearly series of races from top drivers and horses from around the world. The Driving Championship would take the drivers and horses to races in Europe, Australia, United States and Canada, among other countries. Bergstein also created a yearly convention of the harness racing industry, managing the event. He was a keynote speaker, and also was master of ceremonies at many annual events over the decades. Bergstein owned a series of harness horses during his life, and also was partner in a number of horse breeding operations. Moved with his wife June to Tucson Arizona in the 1980s, moving the offices of HTA there as well. Created a relationship between HTA and the University of Arizona's racing industry studies program, and strove to hire its graduates to his organization.

The fifty-bani is also the only coin of Romania to not be steel-based, but be made completely of an alloy, and was also the first coin in the country to have a written inscription on its edge, with the introduction of 4 new coins in 2019. In addition to Romania, the coin has been minted in the United Kingdom (1867), Belgium (1894, 1910‚Äì1912 and 1914), Germany (1900‚Äì1901, 1910‚Äì1911 and 1914), Switzerland (1921), Hungary (1947), and Russia (1952). History =Principality of Romania= A fifty-bani coin was not included in Romania's first set of decimal coins, minted in 1867 in Birmingham, England. The denomination was introduced in 1873 as a coin of 18mm diameter and weighing 2.5g. It was 83.5% silver and 16.5% copper. The obverse featured the Romanian crown and the date underneath, within a wreath of laurel and oak branches. Below the wreath was the name STERN of the engraver, and at the top of the coin was the mintmark of the mint in Brussels, Belgium, where it was struck. The mintmark was the portrait of Brussels' patron saint, Saint Michael. The reverse had the name of the country and the denomination within a smaller wreath of the same appearance. In 1873 4.81 million of the coin were issued. The only other year of mintage was 1876 with 2,116,980 from the same mint. The coin was known in the Romanian region of Moldavia (now the nation of Moldova) as a DutcƒÉ, after silver coins of Poland and Russia which circulated in Romania. In the region of Walachia, it was known as a bƒÉncutjƒÉ.http://romaniancoins.org/50bani1873.html The second fifty-bani was the first to feature a Romanian monarch. It was struck only in 1881 and to the same specifications as the first version. The obverse featured a portrait of Carol I of Romania facing left. His inscription was CAROL I DOMNUL ROMANIEI (Carol I Prince of the Romanians) and the engraver's surname, Kullrich, was written below. The reverse featured the Romanian coat of arms, with the date split on each side. The country's name was above the arms and the denomination below. Below the coat of arms on the left was a 'V' mintmark of Vienna, Austria where all of the 1,000,000 coins were minted. Below on the right was a grain of wheat, representing Bucharest's mint.http://romaniancoins.org/50bani1873.html =Kingdom of Romania= In 1884, a third fifty-bani commenced minting in Bucharest, Romania's capital, with the same dimensions and composition of the previous two. The obverse of Carol I now had the inscription CAROL I REGE AL ROMANIEI (Carol I King of the Romanians). The reverse had the denomination and date in a wreath of laurel and oak. One million were issued, with or without the 'B' mintmark. In 1885, 200,000 of the coin were issued, and the portrait was very slightly different.http://romaniancoins.org/50bani1884.html A fourth fifty-bani was struck in 1894 in Brussels, Belgium with the same specifications. The new portrait of Carol I was sculpted by an A. SCHARFF whose name featured below. In 1894, 600,000 were issued. The coin's next strike was 1900, and 3.838 million were minted in Hamburg, Germany. These coins, and the 194,205 struck at the same city in the following year, had a wider diameter at 18.5mm.http://romaniancoins.org/50bani1894.html The fifth coin of the denomination had a minting run from 1910 to 1914 (excluding 1913). It maintained the 18mm diameter of the previous fifty-bani coins and kept the same composition. The coins were minted at Brussels and Hamburg, the difference being that the Brussels-struck coins had 101 reeds on the edge compared to 120 from Hamburg. A new sculptor, Tasset, put his name beneath the portrait of Carol I on the obverse. The reverse featured the crown of Romania above olive branches, with the country's name on the left, the denomination on the right and the date below. Although not a member of the Latin Monetary Union, Romania agreed to its weights and measured which aimed to create a universal currency around Europe. The fifty-bani of 1910-1914 shares many similarities with the French ¬Ω Franc of the same time.http://romaniancoins.org/50bani1910.html A sixth fifty-bani was minted exclusively in 1921, with 30 million produced in Le Locle, Switzerland by the company Huguenin Fr√®res (brothers) & Co. The coin was 21mm in diameter with a hole in the middle, and weighed 1.203 g due to being made entirely from aluminium. The hole was 4 mm or 4.5 mm depending on the piece. On the obverse was the eagle from the Romanian coat of arms, with a Christian cross in his beak, perched on top of the hole. The country's name is underneath. On the reverse was the denomination, with the 0 in 50 surrounding the hole. The Romanian crown was placed to the right of the hole. The mintmark Huguenin was placed at the bottom of the reverse.http://romaniancoins.org/50bani1921.html After a monetary reform on 15 August 1947, 20,000 old lei became a new leu, and a fifty-bani coin was briefly re-introduced. It measured 16mm in diameter and weighed 1.7g. The coin was made of 80% copper, 19% zinc and 1% nickel. Its obverse featured the Romanian crown in the centre, with the country name at the top and date at the bottom. The reverse featured the denomination. The coin was minted in Bucharest and Budapest, Hungary, to an extent of 13.4 million coins.http://romaniancoins.org/50bani1947.html On 30 December 1947 however, the monarchy of Romania was forced out by communists. =People's Republic of Romania= The only time during the communist rule of Romania that a fifty bani was minted was in 1955‚Äì56 during the People's Republic of Romania. The coin was 25 mm in diameter, weighed 4.55 g and was made of cupro- nickel. The obverse featured the communist coat of arms of Romania and the inscription around it REPUBLICA POPULARA ROM√éNA (Romanian People's Republic). Despite the circumflex on the 'I' in 'ROMINA', the inscription was inaccurate as accents should have been placed on the 'A' in 'POPULARA' and 'ROMINA'. The reverse featured a male worker making tongs on an anvil, with a background of smoking chimneys, conveyor belts and silos. The denomination was split either side of the image. The coin was produced in Bucharest, with 16.7 million in 1955 and 11.4 million in 1956.http://romaniancoins.org/50bani1955.html = Romania = On 1 July 2005, Romania redenominated its currency at the rate of 10,000 old lei to 1 new leu. The new fifty-bani coin thus replaced the old 5,000 lei coin which had been the largest denomination. Early versions of the coin from 2005 are 0.15mm narrower in diameter, at 23.6mm.http://worldcoingallery.com/countries/display.php?image=img13/148-50b05&desc;=Romania km192 50 Bani (2005) 23.6mm&query;=Romania The coin was sold to large shops in rolls of fifty coins.http://romaniancoins.org/1ban2005.html A commemorative coin featuring Romanian aeronautical pioneer Aurel Vlaicu was released on 25 October 2010 to mark the centennial of his first flight in 1910. The obverse featured Vlaicu's portrait with his name on the top-left corner with the date 1910. His plane was placed at the bottom with the years of his life, 1882-1913. The reverse combined elements of the common obverses and reverses; with the date, denomination, coat of arms and country name crossed with horizontal lines. Five-thousand proof coins were issued.http://romaniancoins.org/50bani10_aurel_vlaicu.html On 12 September 2011, a second commemorative was released as part of a series on Christian art in the feudal era. The obverse featured Mircea the Elder and was struck off- centre like mediaeval hammered coins. It was inscribed MIRCEA CEL BATRAN and also had the years of his rule, 1386-1418. The reverse featured the Cozia Monastery within the '0' of '50', with the country's name in mediaeval writing at the top, the year on the left, and coat of arms at the bottom. Five million were issued,http://romaniancoins.org/50bani2011_mircea_cel_batrin.html as well as 500 proof coins in the denomination 200 lei, made of pure gold.http://romaniancoins.org/200lei11_mircea_cel_batrin.html  References  Category:Coins of Romania Category:Fifty-cent coins Category:Currencies introduced in 1873 ","title":"Fifty bani"},{"id":"33645622","text":"Stefan Veselka is a Norwegian classical pianist and conductor.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Saint Helens, the archdeaconry of Warrington, and the diocese of Liverpool. Its benefice is united with those of St Nicholas, Sutton, and St Michael and All Angels, Sutton, to form the Sutton Team. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History All Saints was built between 1891 and 1893, and designed by the Lancaster firm of architects, Paley, Austin and Paley. The land and a donation of ¬£1,000 () were given by the lord of the manor, William Pilkington of the Pilkington glass manufacturing firm. The foundation stone was laid by Pilkington's daughter on 4 August 1891, and the church was consecrated on 14 October 1893 by the Rt Revd John Ryle, Bishop of Liverpool. The architects planned for a tower on the crossing, but this was never built. The estimated final cost of the church was ¬£6,800, and it provided seating for 600 people. Architecture =Exterior= The church is constructed in red sandstone, and has cement-tile roofs. Its plan is cruciform, and consists of a five-bay nave with a clerestory, north and south aisles, a southwest porch, north and south transepts, and a two-bay chancel with a chapel and a vestry. The architectural style is Gothic Revival. The windows in the aisles and clerestory have three lights, and those in the chapel and vestry have two lights. At the west end are buttresses and a four-light window. The east window has five lights and contains staggered transoms. =Interior= The authors of the Buildings of England series describe the interior as being \\"impressive\\" and \\"dignified\\". The arcades are carried on octagonal piers with moulded capitals. The piers at the crossing are massive, having been built in preparation for the unbuilt tower. At the west end of the church, two bays have been converted into a parish room, with a glazed screen between it and the rest of the church. The stained glass in the east window is a memorial to the Pilkington family; it was made in 1905 by Shrigley and Hunt. The organ dates from 1900 and was given by William Pilkington.

Facts  The Prevention of Illegal Eviction from and Unlawful Occupation of Land ActAct 19 of 1998. gives \\"unlawful occupiers\\" some procedural and substantive protection against eviction from land. At the time of the launch of these two applications to evict, both occupiers had, according to the ordinary meaning in the Act, been \\"unlawful occupiers,\\" as they had occupied land without consent. The question arose, however, as to whether \\"unlawful occupiers\\" were only those who had unlawfully taken possession of land‚Äîsquatters, in other words‚Äîor whether the term included those who had at one stage enjoyed lawful possession but whose possession had subsequently become unlawful. To exclude such persons from the definition of \\"unlawful occupier\\" would necessitate an amendment to the definition to apply to a person who occupied land without the consent, express or tacit, of the owner or person in charge, or without any other right in law to occupy such land.Para 5. It needed therefore to be considered whether or not there were indicators in the Act to justify such an emendation. In neither Ndlovu nor Bekker had the applicants for eviction complied with the procedural requirements of the Act; the only issue for the Court to decide was whether or not they had been obliged to do so. As there was no appearance for the respondents, and as the appellants intended to argue the same issue from different perspectives, it was decided to hear their appeals concurrently. = Ndlovu = Ndlovu was a case of holding over in which the consent of the owner had lapsed: On the lawful termination of the tenant's lease, he had refused to vacate the property. The magistrate held that the Act did not apply to the circumstances of the case, and the High Court upheld this decision on appeal. = Bekker = In Bekker, a mortgage bond had been called up and the property sold in execution and transferred to the appellants. The erstwhile owner, however, refused to vacate. This was also, therefore, a case of holding over, although here the occupier, who had originally held qua owner, had never enjoyed the consent of the present owner. In an application for eviction in the High Court, the Judge raised mero motu the question of non-compliance with the Act, and subsequently dismissed the application. An appeal to a Full Bench was also dismissed. The argument in Bekker was that, since the Legislature regarded the mortgagor as an unlawful occupier, it had to follow that the definition could not be restricted to persons who took occupation unlawfully.  Judgment  In a majority judgment,Mpati JA and Mthiyane JA concurring; Olivier JA and Nienaber JA dissenting. Harms JA held that, by the very nature of things, a mortgagor, being an owner, could not be an unlawful occupier. Only once the property had been sold in execution and transferred to a purchaser could the possession of the erstwhile mortgagor or owner become unlawful. To call a mortgagor an \\"unlawful occupier\\" was not only incongruous but also absurd.Para 8. Harms also held that the Act distinguished between unlawful occupiers who had occupied for less than six monthss 4(6). and those who had occupied for more than six months.s 4(7). The former had fewer rights, as the court, in considering the application for their eviction, did not have to consider whether or not land had been made available or could reasonably be made available for their relocation. In the event of a sale in execution over bonded property, however, those with less than six months' occupation received more protection, because the court had to have regard to the needs of the elderly, children, disabled persons and households headed by women,s 4(6) something it did not have to take into account in the case of those who had occupied for more than six months.s 4(6)Para 10. Harms held further that the ordinary definition of the term meant, textually, that the Act applied to all \\"unlawful occupiers,\\" irrespective of whether their possession had at an earlier stage been lawful.Para 11. There had clearly been a substantial class of persons whose vulnerability might have been a concern of Parliament when it enacted the legislation. The Bill of Rights and social or remedial legislation often conferred benefits on persons for whom they were not primarily intended. There seemed to be no reason in the general social and historical context of South Africa why the Legislature should not have wished to afford the vulnerable class of the landless poor the protection of the Act.Para 16. The landlord's problem with the affluent tenant, Harms found, was not so oppressive as at first it seemed. The tenant would obviously, to the annoyance of the landlord, be entitled to the somewhat cumbersome procedural advantages of the Act, but what it did was to delay or suspend the exercise of the landowner's full proprietary rights until a determination had been made as to whether or not it was just and equitable to evict the unlawful occupier, and under what conditions. This discretion was one in the wide, not the narrow, sense.Paras 17-18. Harms added, however, that a court a quo did not have a free hand to do whatever it wished, and the court of appeal was not hamstrung by the traditional grounds of whether the court a quo had exercised its discretion capriciously or upon a wrong principle, or had not brought its unbiased judgment to bear on the question, or had acted without substantial reasons.Para 18. Provided that the procedural requirements had been met, Harms held that the owner was entitled to approach the court on the basis of ownership and the respondent's unlawful occupation. Unless the occupier opposed or disclosed circumstances relevant to the eviction order, the owner, in principle, would be entitled to an order for eviction.Para 19. Buildings or structures that did not perform the function of a form of dwelling or shelter for humans did not fall under the Act. Since juristic persons did not have dwellings, their unlawful possession was not protected by the Act.Para 20. Finally, it could not be discounted that Parliament had intended to extend the protection of the Act to cases of holding over of dwellings and the like. The Ndlovu appeal had therefore to succeed and the Bekker to fail. This was not to imply that the owners concerned would not be entitled to apply for and obtain eviction orders; it meant only that the procedures of the Act had to be followed.Para 23.

It lasted from September 1848 to November 1849. In October 1848, Slovak leaders replaced their original Hungaro-federal program by Austro-federal, called for the separation of a Slovak district () from the Kingdom of Hungary and for the formation of a new autonomous district within the framework of the Habsburg Monarchy. Background The year 1848 is well- noted in history as a peaking moment in nationalist sentiment among European nationalities. The Slovak nation, though not fully conscious of ethnicity in 1848, were certainly an important part of the general revolts occurring in the lands of the Habsburg Monarchy. After the revolutionary fervor left Paris in 1848 it traveled to Vienna, where a popular uprising ousted the reactionary government of Prince Klemens von Metternich on 13 March 1848. This revolutionary fervor soon spread to the Hungarian lands of the Empire. On 15 March, mass protests in Buda and Pest along with a proclamation of the Hungarian Diet, under direction of Lajos Kossuth, saw the Hungarian Kingdom declare itself independent of Habsburg domination. =Slovaks before 1848= Slovaks were not prominently placed in this first wave of revolution to reach Hungarian lands. On 26‚Äì28 August 1844, a meeting between both Catholic and Protestant confessions of Slovaks met along with other factions in Lipt√≥szentmikl√≥s (today: Liptovsk√Ω Mikul√°≈°). This town in the ≈Ωilina Region was the base of Slovak nationalist Michal Miloslav Hod≈æa, uncle of future Czechoslovak politician Milan Hodza. The meeting, though with fewer than wished Catholic participation, formed a non-sectarian association called the Tatr√≠n in order to unite all Slovak groups in one national bloc.≈†piesz, p. 107 Catholics later became more involved in 1847 with their acceptance of ƒΩudov√≠t ≈†t√∫r's standardization of the Slovak language. Michal Miloslav Hod≈æa Jozef Miloslav Hurban In addition to the uniting of Slovaks in one national bloc, there were other factors leading to the rise in Slovak consciousness before 1848. In 1845, governmental authorities permitted the printing of Slovak language newspapers for the first time. The first one was ƒΩudov√≠t ≈†t√∫r's The Slovak National News which printed its first issue on 1 August 1845. This was quickly followed by Jozef Miloslav Hurban's Slovak Views on the Sciences, Arts and Literature which did not have as much success as ≈†t√∫r's paper. Beyond the printed word, representatives of the Slovak National Movement worked among average Slovaks promoting education, Sunday schools, libraries, amateur theatre, temperance societies and other social functions.≈†piesz, pp. 108‚Äì109 In agriculture, Samuel Jurkoviƒç founded a credit cooperative in the village of Soboti≈°te, called the Farmer's Association, which was the first of its kind in Europe.≈†piesz, p. 109 In November 1847 ƒΩudov√≠t ≈†t√∫r, the member of the Hungarian Diet for Z√≥lyom (now Zvolen), spoke before his colleagues in Pressburg (Pozsony, today's Bratislava). In his speech to the Diet, ≈†t√∫r summed up his six-point platform involving problematic political and economic issues. His points were: * To proclaim through the Diet the legal, universal and permanent abolishment of serfdom, achieved through a buy-out of feudal contracts with state funds at minimum expense to commoners. * To abolish the patrimonial court and free commoners from noble control. * To allow commoners to represent their own interests via membership in County government and the Diet. * To free privileged towns from county jurisdiction and reorganize the administration of royally chartered towns on the principal of representation by strengthening their voting rights in the Diet. * To abolish the privilege of nobility and make all persons equal before the courts, abolish tax exemption for nobility and inheritance, ensure commoners the right to serve in public office and ensure freedom of the press. * To reorganize the education system in a way to best serve the needs of the people and to ensure a better livelihood for teachers. Along with these points, of which several even met the praise of Kossuth, ≈†t√∫r raised the issues about the use of the Slovak language in government and the enforcement of Magyar interference in many parts of Slovak life, including religion.≈†piesz, pp. 110 Events of 1848‚Äì1849 The events of the years 1848‚Äì1849 caused the buildup outbreak of the Slovak Uprising. =Build up to the revolt= After the revolution in Pest-Buda in 1848 March 15., and the formation of a new government on 17 March. the threat of forcible Magyarization grew ever more present. In Hont County, some of this tension came to a boiling point where two Slovaks, named Janko Kral and Jan Rotarides made demands for the liquidation of serfdom and recognition of the Slovak language in schools and the government. These demands soon landed the pair in jail.≈†piesz, pp. 111 On 28 March 1848 a vast assembly of former serfs convened by Lipt√≥ County and held in Hodza's base of Liptovsk√Ω Mikul√°≈° was used as a proving ground for systematic recognition of new rights and extended rights to national minorities. This was met well and soon the word was spreading about possible new freedoms that would reach Slovaks, prompting some miners in the area comprising today's Central-Slovakia to demonstrate rowdily before being quieted by a special commissioner from Pest-Buda. In April 1848 ≈†t√∫r and Hurban attended a preliminary Slavic meeting in Vienna, which would later provide the basis for the first Pan-Slavic Congress to be held in Prague. In the meantime, back in Liptovsk√Ω Mikul√°≈°, Hod≈æa along with twenty delegates created a document entitled Demands of the Slovak Nation which listed 14 points setting national and social goals for the Slovak nation. Naturally this document was received coldly by Pest-Buda, which subsequently imposed martial law on Upper Hungary and issued warrants for ≈†t√∫r, Hurban and Hod≈æa on 12 May 1848.Mallows, pp. 191 At the same time, uprisings among Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in the southern part of Hungary diverted Magyar attention to the south, as these conflicts were more armed uprisings than the Slovak one. Hurban attended a session of the Croatian Diet on 5 July, speaking to the Croats on the plight of the Slovaks. Hurban spoke so well a joint Croat-Slovak declaration was issued shortly thereafter which only inflamed Magyar opinion.≈†piesz, pp. 114‚Äì115 When the full Pan-Slavic Congress met on 2 June 1848, ≈†t√∫r, Hurban, Hod≈æa and many other prominent Slovaks attended, along with hundreds of other Slavic delegates. This congress was held with the aim of developing a cohesive strategy for all Slavic peoples living in Austro-Hungarian territories. Unfortunately, the congress was cut short when an armed uprising in Prague on 12 June prompted a hurried end to the affair. However, one critical item came out of the short congress for the Slovak cause. In the congress, the Slovaks secured the help of two Czech military officers, Bed≈ôich Bloudek and Franti≈°ek Zach, in case the Slovaks came to armed blows with the Hungarians. Franti≈°ek Zach in 1867 Though many calls for autonomy came from nearly every corner of the Empire, Vienna noted that at neither the Pan-Slavic conference nor other Slavic uprisings was the thought of the breakup of the Empire considered, only this was so in Hungary. Seeing the situation as malleable, the Emperor along with his closest advisors authorized armed action against the Hungarian uprising. This first manifested itself in the form of the leader of the Croatians, Ban (governor) Josip Jelaƒçiƒá, a friend of the Slovaks, who was authorized to march against the Hungarians in August 1848 after the Hungarians had defied a direct imperial order. Despite this, Vienna's response to the Hungarian uprising had stayed largely quiet and mixed.≈†piesz, pp. 115 While allowing Jelacic to march against the Magyars, they had also given the Hungarian Army several units in order to help preserve internal order. At the same time, Slovaks started working with Jelacic's Croatians by creating a Slovak volunteer corps. This corps was put together and gathered in Vienna from August to September 1848. In order to lead this burgeoning revolt, a Slovak National Council was organized in Vienna, where a marker stands today commemorating the spot. The council was made up of ≈†t√∫r, Hurban and Hod≈æa‚Äîthe \\"big three\\" of the Slovak nationalist groups‚Äîwith the Czech Franti≈°ek Zach as commander-in-chief. =Revolt= Slovak volunteers, 1848/49 Initially, the strategy for the volunteer corps was not clear. However, on 16 September a decision was made that the 600 men of the corps would march from Vienna, up the V√°g River valley and into Tur√≥c County and Lipt√≥ County Counties via the southern Moravian town of B≈ôeclav. When the corps arrived at the Slovak border on the 18th, they were met with 500 more volunteers from Brno and Prague. Once convened, the volunteers received arms and swore an oath on the Slovak flag. Despite nudging Viennese cooperation, when the volunteers encountered Imperial troops on the road to Miava they were regarded coolly by the troops.≈†piesz, pp. 116 Once the volunteers arrived in Miava, an assembly of Slovaks with Hurban presiding took the step of seceding from Hungary on 19 September 1848. Imperial troops soon ordered the Slovaks volunteers to leave Myjava, though this order was rejected and instead the corps attacked an Imperial detachment and confiscated its supplies. Despite this inauspicious act, Imperial troops ordered both sides to halt the fighting. After several more days of indecisive armed action, the volunteers retreated back into Moravia. Not long after, the new commander of Imperial forces sent to restore order in the Kingdom of Hungary, Count von Lamberg, was hacked and mangled by an irate mob in central Budapest only three days after arrival.Historical Commission of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences, vol. 13 pp. 429 This halted attempts at negations between Kossuth and the Imperial party.≈†piesz, pp. 117 The Viennese response was to formally order the disbandment the Hungarian Diet and the appointment of Ban Josip Jelaƒçiƒá as newest commander over Hungary. However, effective response to this latest development was also halted by another popular, pan-Germanic uprising in Vienna at the time which resulted in the death of war minister Count Latour on 6 October 1848. In this midst of the turmoil in Vienna, which saw the Emperor and the Imperial Diet flee to Olomouc in Moravia, Magyars stepped up measures against Slovaks, stripping the leaders of the Slovak National Council of their Hungarian citizenship and executing a handful of prisoners. This move caused the Slovak faction to appeal more to the Imperial court and despite initial concerns of the commander-in-chief Prince Windisch-Gr√§tz, another Slovak volunteer unit was allowed to be created.≈†piesz, pp. 118‚Äì119 Initial recruitment problems delayed this second campaign of the volunteer units until 4 December 1848. Throughout December and January, the Slovak volunteers under Bloudek worked with Imperial troops to reoccupy T√∫r√≥cszentm√°rton. On 13 January 1849 a mass rally in T√∫r√≥cszentm√°rton was followed by the signing up of new volunteers. Acting with Imperial support, Bloudek moved east and, picking up another few thousand volunteers,≈†piesz, pp. 119 occupied Eperjes (Pre≈°ov) on 26 February and Kassa (Ko≈°ice) on 2 March. Meanwhile, another detachment of Slovaks was defeated after running into Magyar forces near Mur√°nyalja (Mur√°≈à) in Beszterceb√°nya (Bansk√° Bystrica). To make matters worse, dissension between Czech and Slovak officers in the volunteer corps began to erupt. A young Emperor Franz Joseph I After leading activist rallies in Eperjes and T√∫r√≥cszentm√°rton, ≈†t√∫r and Hurban led a delegation of twenty-four men to meet the new Emperor Franz Jozef with a proposal to make Slovakia an autonomous grand duchy directly under Viennese oversight with representation in the Imperial Diet. The delegates also requested a Slovak provincial diet, with further demands for Slovak schools and institutions. Despite a formal audience with the Emperor, little real progress resulted and the Slovaks were sent packing hoping for more productive results in the future.Bartl, pp. 222 After several victorious battles in Spring of 1849, Kossuth and the Hungarian Diet declared the Habsburgs deposed on 14 April 1849. Around the same time, the Slovak volunteer corps, largely stationed in √Årva County, was dealing with internal struggles of its own. Conflicts between Czech and Slovak officers soon brought about the effectual dissolving of the corps.≈†piesz, pp. 121 After Russian intervention by Tsar Nicholas I brought about the gradual fall of Kossuth and Hungarian independence. During this period, the corps was revived one final time to 'mop-up' isolated Magyar units until the eventual capitulation of Magyar forces at Vil√°gos (what is now ≈ûiria in Romania) on 13 August 1849. On 9 October 1849, the Imperial army transferred the Slovak corps from the central territories of Upper Hungary to Pozsony, where it was formally disbanded on 21 November 1849. This marked the end of Slovak participation in the Revolutions of 1848‚Äì1849 that swept the continent of Europe≈†piesz, pp. 122 Aftermath =Slovak Perspective= Historians Anton ≈†piesz and Du≈°an ƒåaploviƒç sum up the impacts of the uprising and the era the following way: =Hungarian perspective= The Hungarian revolution took place in a legally complex environment. Hungary was a de iure independent kingdom tied to Austria by a common ruler. At first king Ferdinand V endorsed the reformist demands of the Hungarian diet and appointed a constitutional government led by Lajos Batthy√°ny. The conservative circles of the Vienna court feared from the growing independece of the Hungarians, so they instructed the Ban of Croatia to attack Hungary. Legally this meant that a monarch attacks one of his country's lawful government with another of his country's army. Later the conservatives in Vienna forced Ferdinand to abdicate and replaced him with the young Franz Joseph. He was not crowned a king of Hungary therefore his rule lacked a legal basis in Hungary. In order to defeat the now open (but lawful) rebellion of Hungary, the Viennese court manipulated the ethnic minorities of Hungary into revolt against the Hungarian government (the very same government that achieved the abolition of serfdom in the Kingdom, regardless of ethnicity). The claim that the Slovak nation sided with Vienna is erroneous - they could hardly recruit around 2000 people from Upper Hungary (however their highest number is estimated cca. 10,000ww.forumhistoriae.sk/documents/10180/887951/Kovac_Sondy-2013.pdf, p. 93.) - in fact the number of Slovaks fighting on the Hungarian side was significantly greater (estimated around 40,000 by historians). However, there were cases of ethnic Slovaks resisting recruitment into the Hungarian Army, notably in the western part of the Nyitra County and in parts of the G√∂m√∂r √©s Kishont County, especially in the town of Tiszolcz (Tisovec) where the locals protested against the unlawful Hungarian recruitment and were led by ≈†tefan Marko Daxner. The Slovaks had a much higher percentage of their population serving in the Honv√©ds√©g (Home Guard) than Hungarians. Notable troops with purely or almost purely Slovak soldiers were found in the 2., the 4., the 34., the 51., the 60. and the 124. infantry battalions, and a great many Slovaks served in the most famous red-hatted 9. battalion. Also, the 8. and 10. Hussar regiments had more companies composed of Slovak soldiers. There were also a lot of high-ranking officers in the Honv√©ds√©g, who considered themselves Slovak patriots, most notably Lajos Beniczky, who was nicknamed the \\"Duke of Slovaks\\" by contemporaries, and he didn't learn Hungarian until after the end of the war.

It is the only species in its genus. Description 'Sericula gora is a silvery fish with an upward pointing mouth, shich has a prominent cartilagenous knob on the lower jaw, and a keel running along the abdomen from below the pectoral fin to the anal fin. The dorsal fin has its origin in front of that of the anal fin. The caudal fin has its lower lobe longer than the upper lobe and the pelvic fins has well developed axillary scales. There are 140-160 scales in the lateral line which is complete and decurved. It grows to a maximum length of 24.5cm. Distribution Securicula gora is known to occur in the Ganges and Brahmaputra drainages of India, Bangladesh and Nepal. The presence of this species in the Punjab in India and Pakistan has not been confirmed. Habitat and ecology Securicula gora is a pelagic, freshwater species which can be found in rivers, beels and canals. It is a predatory species which feeds on insects, insect larvae and crustaceans which it takes at or near the surface of the water. In 1988 a new species of monogenean parasite, Heteromazocraes mamaevi was described from specimens of S. gora sampled near Lucknow, until then this genus of parasites had been thought only to occur on members of the Clupeid family Engraulidae. Conservation and Human use Securicula gora is a common and widespread species where it occurs and is thus treated as Least Concern by the IUCN but its habitat can be affected by silting caused by logging and consequent deforestation of the land surrounding the waters it inhabits. This species is consumed as food in Bangladesh and other parts of it range where it is normally of minor interest to commercial fisheries, except in parts of India where it is commercially fished for.

For safety's sake On September 16, 1941, the Soviet and the British troops passed the Iranian borders and occupied Iran. By the request of Hasan Arfa and order of Reza Shah, Colonel Mikeladze was transferred to Isfahan for his safety. The reason for his transfer was that the Russians occupying Iran could arrest Colonel Mikeladze and execute him on the pretext of being a deserter from the Russian army two decades ago.\\"Under Five Shahs‚Äù, by General Hassan Arfa, William Morrow & Co., New York, 1965, p. 220-221.

They facilitated the transport of various agricultural and mineral produce from locations hardly accessible by road. They therefore enabled many communities to become prosperous. These lines featured the largest and most powerful locomotives ever in existence on two- foot-gauge railways worldwide. All two-foot railways were operated isolated from each other. However, this did not prevent standardization and interchangeability of rolling stock and locomotives. The larger railway lines operated their own workshops performing minor to major maintenance and/or repairs. For the purpose of major overhauls and interchangeability, rolling stock could be transported piggyback on Cape gauge rolling stock by means of a special access ramp on the break of gauge at Cape gauge junctions available on most of the two-foot lines. Their decline started in the 1980s, the last commercial line ceased operations in the 1990s. Only a few tourist, agricultural and/or heritage railways survive. Many defunct locomotives are plinthed at various former railway station sites or work on the Welsh Highland Railway and other heritage railways in and outside South Africa.  Nomenclature  It is common for South Africans to consider anything less than 1,067 mm (3 ft 6 in, Cape gauge) as a narrow-gauge railway and are accustomed referring to \\"standard gauge\\" when they actually mean \\"Cape gauge\\".

Regauged to cape gauge. Before the gauge conversion many locomotives were interchanged with the South African two foot railway systems depending on various operational considerations. After the gauge conversion the remaining stock was transferred to the two-foot lines. The gauge difference is explained by the metric system used by the Germans who built the Otavi Line contrary to the South Africans who used imperial units. =Kalbaskraal‚ÄìHopefield‚ÄìSaldanha= 1903‚Äì1926, regauged to cape gauge. 46 miles long.

In 1977 she left for a foreign course of study to New York, New York where she shot ‚ÄúBored‚Äù, a super 8 movie which eventually was shown in the Berliner SO 36 by Martin Kippenberger. While in New York she took drumming lessons with Fred Maher, the drummer for Lou Reed. On a 1978 visit to her hometown, Duesseldorf, Germany, she met with Eva Gossling in Carmen Knoebels underground club, Ratinger Hof. It was here that she suggested establishing an all-girls band as soon as she returned to Berlin. Eva and Karen, who was studying in Berlin, met Beate Bartel, a bassist and sound engineer, at the Wittenbergplatz subway station. They were joined at their first meeting by tenor saxophonist Bettina K√∂ster and Gudrun Gut, the owner of a mini Moog synthesizer. During the summer of 1979 Mania D rehearsed daily in their Martin Luther Street studio. Beate Bartel named the band, whereas Karin Luner had the idea to shoot a super 8 movie to be shown at all concerts. Karin Luner created the styling for the super-8 movie, Fashion Interlection. The outfit for the video was designed by Eisengrau, Claudia Skoda and Karin Luner. Martin Kippenberger, Volker Anding and Oswald Wiener promoted the young band with organizing concerts, and diner for free at exil, a restaurant owned by Oswald Wiener. Their first concert outside of Berlin was in Sappened in September of ¬¥79 in the Wuppertal Nordstadt Kollektiv Galerie. . Recognition Their recognition led to an invitation to perform in New York.

Eva Gossling was invited by Alexander von Borsig alias Alexander Hacke and Richard Hirsch to play in the Berlin band, Blasse. In December 1979 Mania D performed with a smaller crew. In 1981 they founded the band, Malaria!, which unified elements of free jazz with those of experimental music with a distinctive saxophone sound. Bettina K√∂ster‚Äôs especially striking singing voice characterized the band and replicated the music of Berlin in the Twenties. Gudrun Gut and Bettina K√∂ster along with Eisengrau developed an independent fashion label and a concept store. Under this name they created their unconventional stage outfits. The legendary fog-concert occurred on January 18, 1980 at the unheated SO36 club where it was so cold that patrons could see their breath. A never-before viewed video of the event was discovered in 2010 in the archives of the video artist and filmmaker, Werner Schmiedel. Mania D was not part of the commercial oriented new - German wave, which started in early 1981 after the growing success of bands like D.A.F. and Fehlfarben.

It is typically usedin those with brain injuries or learning disabilities. A beginning student or patient learns to walk smoothly in a figure-eight pattern while looking at an object or person across the room.This video shows a simple infinity walk. As they become able to do that consistently, other physical and mental activities are added to the coordinated walking. An advanced walker can maintain a smooth figure-eight walk while doing several other activities, e.g., simultaneously gesturing and doing mental arithmetic as they converse with their teacher or therapist. Developed in the 1980s by clinical psychologist Deborah Sunbeck. It strives to improve the sensorimotor functioning of those who practice it. In developing the method, Sunbeck also applied knowledge of social facilitation and intrinsic motivation to the task of creating a self-motivating method of physical and mental skill-building that would help the user develop resilient self-regulated learning strategies for future challenges.

It is the second installment in the Hetty Feather Trilogy. The story continues where Hetty Feather left off. Hetty, now 14 years old, is discharged from the Foundling Hospital and begins life as a scullery maid.  Plot  After finding out that Ida, the kitchen maid of the Foundling Hospital is her mother, Hetty regularly sneaks into her room at night to bond with her. Hetty dreams of being a successful author, writing stories under her true name, Sapphire Battersea. However, one night, Hetty is followed by another girl, Sheila Mayhew, who often bullies her. Hetty and Ida's relationship is found out and as a result, Ida is fired and is sent away to Bignor-on-Sea (named after Bignor but based on Bognor Regis and Middleton-on-Sea) as a housekeeper to an elderly woman by Miss Sarah Smith, a member of the Board of Governors and a friend of Hetty's. When the time comes for Hetty to be discharged from the hospital, Miss Smith arranges for Hetty to be sent to Mr. Charles Buchanan, a fellow writer, as a scullery maid in the countryside of Kingtown. As Hetty is picked up by Mr. Buchanan's cook, Mrs. Briskett, a young man calls out to her and unsuccessfully tries to chase down the cab she was in. This young man is later revealed as Hetty's former foster brother, Jem. After spending most of her childhood cooped up in the Foundling Hospital, Hetty is often confused, scared and in awe by the outside world. As she settles into her job, Hetty becomes a secretary of sorts to Mr. Buchanan, copying his stories as Mr. Buchanan's handwriting is hard to read. In return, Mr. Buchanan agrees to help refine Hetty's memoir, and to supply Hetty with stamps so she can continue to write to her mother. She also finds a potential love interest in Bertie, the local butcher's boy, who takes her out to the fair, on a boat ride, and for a walk in the park. Hetty also accompanies the parlourmaid, Sarah, to a seance with Madame Berenice, a medium. During the seance, an apparition of Hetty's long-dead foster brother, Saul, appears before Hetty, frightening her. Hetty's new life is soon shattered when she accuses Mr. Buchanan of plagiarising her work after she finds a poorly written manuscript of her memoir in his office under the name Emerald Greenwich. Hetty is immediately fired. Before she leaves, Sarah gives Hetty her suitcase and Mrs. Briskett gives her a jar full of money as well as some food to take with her. Hetty goes to see Bertie for the last time before setting off to Bignor to be with her mother. On the train to Bignor, Hetty makes friends with the kindly Greenwood family. Hetty reunites with her mother, but is shocked to see how sickly she has become. She calls for a doctor who diagnoses Ida with consumption. When the doctor breaks the news to Miss Roberts, the woman Ida was caring for, she fires Ida on the spot and refuses to hire Hetty‚Äîfor fear that they would infect her. Ida is admitted to an infirmary while Hetty stays with the Greenwood family for two weeks. She becomes like a part of the family, while continuing to visit Ida. The Greenwoods offer to take her with them when they leave Bignor, but Hetty declines. She gets a job at Mr. Clarendon's Seaside Curiosities as \\"Emerald the Amazing Pocket-Sized Mermaid\\", making a tail out of a green dress, a bodice of pink gauze and a scallop-shell bra. While working here, Hetty makes friends with Freda, a female \\"giant\\". Ida succumbs to her illness and eventually dies in Hetty's arms. With Freda's help, Hetty holds a funeral for Ida. Hetty returns to Kingtown and goes to see Madame Berenice for a seance, with the hope of contacting her now-deceased mother. During the seance, Hetty finds out that Madame Berenice and her sister/accomplice are frauds, but decides not to expose them, as it provides hope (however fake it may be) for Madame Berenice's other clients. Sarah, who was at the seance, takes Hetty back to Mr. Buchanan's house for slice of rabbit pie. In the kitchen, Hetty meets Mr. Buchanan's new servant girl, Rose- May, who reveals that Bertie is now taken with her. Upon hearing this, Hetty runs to the outhouse and vomits. While lamenting the fact that she's truly an orphan now, she hears Ida's voice informing her that she isn't an orphan- her father is still alive. The book ends with Hetty declaring \\"I am Sapphire Battersea,\\" with her intent to seek out her father.  Characters  *Hetty Feather (Sapphire Battersea): The protagonist. Now fourteen-years-old, red haired Hetty is discharged from the Foundling Hospital and put to work as a scullery maid for writer Charles Buchanan but is fired when she accuses him of stealing her memoirs. After spending most of her childhood inside the Foundling Hospital, Hetty is rather out of touch with the outside world, being frightened by a dog, not knowing how to crack open a coconut among other things. *Ida Battersea: Kitchen maid of the Foundling Hospital and Hetty's mother. After their relationship is found out, Ida is fired and sent away to the seaside town of Bignor to be a housekeeper to the elderly Miss Roberts. Ida is diagnosed with consumption and it eventually claims her life. *Bertie: The Butcher's boy and possible love interest for Hetty. Prior to the story, Bertie accidentally sliced of the top of three of his fingers on his left hand and was also in a workhouse at some point. After Hetty leaves Kingtown, he becomes taken with Mr. Buchanan's new servant, Rose-May, telling her he'd make a tippet out of rabbit skins for her. *Mrs. Briskett: Mr. Buchanan's cook, described as a large, meaty woman. She disapproves of Madam Berenice and her seances, as they go against her Christian morals. She is very talented at baking. *Sarah: Mr. Buchanan's parlourmaid, described as looking like a potato. Sarah, is a regular client of Madame Berenice's seances. Hetty chooses not to expose Madam Berenice as a fraud mainly for Sarah's sake. *Mr Charles Buchanan: Hetty's master and an author, described as looking and acting like a monkey. Hetty finds his stories to be painfully dull and unreadable. He fires Hetty after she accuses him of stealing her memoirs and trying to turn it into a story of his own under the title of Emerald Greenwich. *The Greenwood Family: Mr & Mrs. Greenwood, Charlotte, Maisie and Flora: A kind family visiting Bignor for two weeks. They allow Hetty to stay with them and for a while she almost becomes a part of the family. While they propose that Hetty goes home with them to Arundel, Hetty knows deep inside that this will never work out. Nevertheless, they give Hetty their address and encourage her to visit them. Hetty describes them as being the most kindest people she's ever met. *Madame Berenice & Emily: A medium who holds seances. Hetty finds out that she and her sister, Emily, are frauds. Madame Berenice pretends to be possessed by the dead while Emily covers herself in a white veil, pretending to be a ghost. *Miss Sarah Smith: An author, member of the Board of Governors and Hetty's ally. She gives Ida a good reference to help get her a job when she's fired from the Hospital and recommends Hetty to Mr. Buchanan. Hetty enjoys reading her stories. *Rose-May: Mr. Buchanan's new servant. She's described as being small, fair with big blue eyes. She's a devout Baptist who refuses to go to Madame Berenice's seances. Hetty finds her repulsive.  Sequels  The book is followed by Emerald Star which was released 27 September 2012. The series continues with Diamond which is about a girl who Hetty met in Emerald Star. This is followed by Little Stars which follows Hetty and Diamond after the events of Diamond.

Backed by Credit Suisse, Intel Capital, Sierra Ventures, and Next World Capital, DynamicOps developed cloud automation and management solutions. These solutions were designed to help enterprise IT organizations create scalable private, public, and desktop cloud services from their existing technology systems and processes. It was acquired by VMware in 2012.  History  DynamicOps' establishment is connected to Credit Suisse. Its original software was initially developed inside Credit Suisse‚Äôs Global Research and Development Group in 2005 to help the company address the operational and governance challenges of rolling out virtualization technology. In 2007, after having deployed and used the software to manage its virtual machines, Credit Suisse Ventures decided to fund a company based on the technology. They recruited Rich Krueger who formed and led a new company‚ÄîDynamicOps. DynamicOps was incorporated on January 31, 2008, and publicly launched later that spring‚Äîto further develop and market the product. Leslie Muller, who led the development effort at Credit Suisse, became the co- founder and CTO of DynamicOps. The company had raised a total of $27M in venture funding from Credit Suisse, Intel Capital, Sierra Ventures, and Next World Capital. Additionally, DynamicOps had a multi-year licensing and distribution agreement with Dell, in which DynamicOps software was a component of Virtual Integrated System solution. In July 2012, DynamicOps was acquired by VMware for a price ranging from $100 to $150 million.  Technology and products  DynamicOps used Operations Virtualization, a foundational technology for its cloud offerings. Operations Virtualization is an abstraction layer between the multiple management systems that make up cloud infrastructure and its consumers. It allows IT, staff, to apply management to the layers below without the layers above needing to know how or why. DynamicOps offered two products, DynamicOps Cloud Suite and DynamicOps Cloud Development Kit. DynamicOps Cloud Suite is a cloud-enablement suite that includes the DynamicOps Cloud Automation Center, the DynamicOps Platform, and the DynamicOps Design Center. It combines automated IT service delivery with unified governance and control across servers and desktops, virtual and physical, and private and public cloud deployments, as well as a graphical editor for visually modifying activities and workflow logic. Additionally, it uses Operations Virtualization technology to enable IT staff to centrally define cloud services and make them available across a global infrastructure. DynamicOps Cloud Development Kit represents a set of tools and documentation used by developers who have deployed DynamicOps-generated cloud environments, for defining new cloud services.

It was established in 1996 as an association of unpaid volunteer members in Istanbul under the leadership of the renowned Turkish mountaineer Nasuh Mahruki. The organization delivers emergency and disaster relief to people trapped in caves, lost on mountains or to victims of earthquake or flood disasters at home and abroad. The initial purpose of the association's establishment was to provide search and rescue relief for climbers in emergency as no local organization of this type existed so far. History The group was formed first in the aftermath of a mountaineering accident occurred in 1994 on Bolkar Mountains, at which two local climbers were involved. In December 1995, a group of volunteer mountaineers led by Nasuh Mahruki conducted their first organized mission on Mt. Uludaƒü, and rescued people, who got lost in the fog, freezing in heavy snowfall. It was during this operation that the group named itself \\"AKUT\\", which is a concept in medicine terminology. The organization was officially incorporated in the beginning of 1996. The members received earthquake and flood training within the next year. This qualified the organization to work cooperative alongside official agencies during their efforts of natural disaster relief. On January 15, 1999, AKUT was given the status of a charitable organization by the Turkish government. AKUT became generally known after it quickly reacted to the 1999 ƒ∞zmit earthquake, and worked with its 150 permanent members and coordinated over 1,000 helpers, who rescued about 200 people from the debris. In 1999, the organization became a member of United Nations' Search and Rescue Advisory Group (INSARAG). AKUT was officially recognized in 2011 as a \\"mid-sized search and rescue team\\" by INSARAG. AKUT undertook international missions following the 1999 Athens earthquake in Greece, the 1999 Taiwan earthquake, the 2001 Gujarat earthquake in India and the 2003 Bam earthquake in Iran. On November 30, 2016 the chairman Nasuh Mahruki resigned from his duty as a result of strong pressure from the Turkish government, after his speech on TV against the president Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan. He has been given the title \\"Honorary Chairman of AKUT\\". Organization An AKUT member with his search dog at action among the ruins after the 2011 Van earthquake. As of 2015, the organization counts about 250 core members and is also able to deploy around one thousand volunteers if needed. It has appropriate technical equipment for its operations. The headquarters in Istanbul coordinates 35 teams formed in various cities across the country and organize also specific training courses related to search and rescue, disaster preparedness and response for the members and the volunteers. The number of people rescued by AKUT totaled 2062 as of June 2015. References External links * Official webpage * Official webpage of Ankara Team rev. 6. Nov. 2011 * INSARAG USAR Directory rev. 6.

It was presented by Ihagee Kamerawerk Steenbergen GmbH, Dresden at the Leipziger Fr√ºhjahrsmesse in March 1936. The Exakta name was already used by Ihagee on a roll film SLR camera line since 1933, among these the Vest Pocket Exakta Model B from which the Kine Exakta inherited its general layout and appearance. The word Kine (cine, cinema, movie film) never appeared on the camera itself, only in the instruction manuals and advertising to distinguish it from the roll film variants. Several of its features constitute the foundation for the majority of 35mm SLR cameras produced ever since, although at this stage in an infant state. The perforated 35mm film had been used in miniature cameras for more than two decades using the 24x36mm negative format. The single lens reflex principle is even older and was widely used in cameras for the medium format plate- and film material. However, several obstacles had to be overcome to device a useful miniature SLR camera apart from the fact that the film material itself seriously restricted the usefulness of the negative: It is impossible to determine sharp focus on a ground glass for this format with the naked eye - even with a large aperture lens. To overcome this, Ihagee substituted the traditional ground glass focusing screen with a Plano-convex magnifying glass with the flat side facing downwards and ground to form a focusing screen visible magnified in the finder. To further improve focusing accuracy, a small magnifying glass could be swung into place for accurate focusing on a small part of the image. Also to improve focusing accuracy fast lenses were needed, and right from the start Carl Zeiss Jena provided the Tessar 1:2.8 f=5cm, soon to be followed by the Biotar 1:2 5cm and the Schneider-Kreuznach Xenar 1:2 f=5cm for the Kine Exakta. Description The Kine Exakta is made of two major aluminium alloy castings, the outer body shell and the internal frame for the mirror box, the shutter mechanism and the film transport. The latter is inserted into the shell from the top and secured by screws. A fixed finder hood and a separate detachable back cover complete the general layout. The Exakta bayonet lens mount was developed for this camera. The shutter is of the horizontal cloth focal plane type providing exposure times from 12 seconds to 1/1000 second with bipolar flash synchronising contacts on the right-hand camera front. The Kine Exakta controls are somewhat different from those found on most later 35mm SLR film cameras: The finder hood in its collapsed state automatically blocks the shutter release. The film is transported towards the left, leaving the exposed frames the other way round on the filmstrip. The wind-on lever on the left-hand top plate is operated by the left hand thumb and it requires a single 300-degree movement. It advances the film one frame, cocks the shutter, and increments the manual reset frame counter. The lift, turn and set shutter speed dial on the left-hand top plate provides exposure times from 1/25 to 1/1000 second, plus B and Z (time). For double exposures, the shutter may be cocked again by turning the shutter speed dial itself. On the right-hand top plate sits a separately wound dual purpose dial, featuring long time exposure and delayed action shutter release. It works at the shutter setting B and is only settable after the shutter is cocked. Slow speeds are selected by the lift, turn and set procedure against a small index dot. The long exposures times, without delay, are marked in black numerals all the way to 12 seconds, while slow speeds with delayed action are in red numerals to 6 seconds. This is the extent of self-timer release available. All functions are activated by the left-hand front located threaded shutter release button. A film-cutting device is located inside the camera. It enables a partially exposed film to be removed from the camera in daylight for processing provided the left-hand take-up spool was placed in a cassette. A small milled knob at the base is unscrewed and pulled out to cut the film close to the unexposed film cassette. The primary function of the collapsible finder hood is to shield the focusing screen from outside stray light, but by lowering the hinged magnifying glass into the finder for critical focusing, it also becomes a direct vision frame finder. By looking into the rectangular opening at the back of the hood, it provides the field of view of a 50mm lens, a useful feature since the focusing screen image is laterally reversed, which makes it less useful as an action finder. Pushing a small notch to the side at the lover right on the rear finder hood panel, flips the lowered magnifying glass up and away. The finder panels are stowed away one by one, sides first, and covered by the front lid, which is held down by a hook at the back. The hook is furnished with a release button to erect the hood. A small sector lever close to the shutter dial, with R and V engraved next to it in the top plate, controls the film transportation, R for rewind and V for advance, for R√ºckw√§rts and Vorw√§rts in German. A knob on the left-hand edge of the body slides downwards to release the back, which is not hinged, only hooked onto the right-hand edge just before closing by a firm pressure on the left-hand back. Variants Only a few significant changes were made to the original Kine Exakta (version 1) during its production run until it was replaced by the model II in 1948: Within a few months the circular focusing loupe, visible on top of the collapsed finder hood, was replaced by a rectangular one covering about 50% of the ground glass image (version 2). This version also appeared on the North American market as Exacta, spelled with a c (version 3). About a year later, a threaded hole was added at the right-hand front above the flashbulb synchronising contacts for securing the flashgun to the camera (version 4). After the 1939 to 1945 hostilities production of the Exacta version slowly resumed, but with several minor changes to the camera body, among these are: The Ihagee logo no longer appear in relief on the rectangular back door leather patch. The carrying strap eyelets on either side of the top edge of the camera are inserted between two small protrusions and riveted in place. The right-hand shutter dial is milled without a groove along the middle of the edge.

Hilya literally means \\"ornament\\". They originate with the discipline of shama'il, the study of Muhammad's appearance and character, based on hadith accounts, most notably Tirmidhi's al-Shama'il al-Muhamadiyyah wa al-Khasa'il al-Mustafawiyyah (\\"The Sublime Characteristics of Muhammad\\"). In Ottoman-era folk Islam, there was a belief that reading and possessing Muhammad's description protects the person from trouble in this world and the next, it became customary to carry such descriptions, rendered in fine calligraphy and illuminated, as amulets. In 17th-century Ottoman Turkey, hilyes developed into an art form with a standard layout, often framed and used as a wall decoration. 19th-century hilye on gilded and framed panel. Later hilyes were also written for the first four Caliphs, the companions of Muhammad, Muhammad's grandchildren (Hasan and Hussein) and Islamic saints (walis).  Origins in hadith  Hilye, both as the literary genre and as the graphic art form, originates from shama'il, the study of Muhammad's appearance and character. The best source on this subject is considered to be Imam Tirmidhi's al-Shama'il al-Muhamadiyyah wa al-Khasa'il al-Mustafawiyyah (\\"The Sublime Characteristics of Muhammad\\"). The acceptance and influence of this work has led to the use of the term \\"shama'il\\" (appearance) to mean Muhammad's fine morals and unique physical beauty. As they contained hadiths describing Muhammad's spirit and physique, shama-il have been the source of hilye. The best known and accepted of these hadith are attributed to his son-in-law and cousin Ali. The sources of hilye have been the six main hadith books along with other hadith sources, attributed to people such as Aisha, \`Abd Allah ibn \`Abbas, Abu Hurairah, Hasan ibn Ali. While shama'il lists the physical and spiritual characteristics of Muhammad in detail, in hilye these are written about in a literary style. Among other descriptive Shama'il text are the Dala'il al-Nubuwwah of Al-Bayhaqi, Tarih-i Isfahan of Abu Naeem Isfahani, Al- Wafa bi Fadha'il al-Mustafa of Abu'l-Faraj ibn al-Jawzi and Al-Shifa of Qadi Ayyad are the main shemaa-il and hilya books. Literary genre Although many hilyes exist in Turkish literature, Persian literature does not have many examples of the shama'il and hilye genre. Abu Naeem Isfahani wrote a work titled Hilyet√º'l-Evliya, but it is not about Muhammad. For this reason, the hilye is considered one of Turkey's national literary genres. Turkish literature has also some early works that may have inspired the appearance of the hilye as a literary genre. The Vesilet√º'n-necat of S√ºleyman √áelebi (1351-1422 :fr:Suleyman √áelebi (de Bursa)), and the Muhammeddiye of Yazƒ±cƒ±oƒülu Mehmed, referred to Muhammad's characteristics. A 255-verse long Risale-i Resul about the attributes of Muhammad, written by a writer with the penname of ≈ûerifi, was presented to Shahzade Bayezid, one of the sons of Suleiman the Magnificent, at an unknown date that was presumably before the Shahzade's death in 1562. This is believed to be the earliest hilye in verse form in Turkish literature. However, the Hilye-i ≈ûerif by Mehmet Hakani (d. 1606‚Äì07) is considered the finest example of the genre (see section below). Hilye-i ≈ûerif, Digitised copy of the 1898 edition at archive.org The first hilye written in prose form is Hilye-i Celile ve ≈ûemail-i 'Aliye by Hoca Sadeddin Efendi. Although the hilye tradition started with descriptions of Muhammad, later hilyes were written about the first four Caliphs, the companions of Muhammad, Muhammad's grandchildren (Hasan and Hussein) and Islamic saints (walis) such as Mevlana. The second most important hilye, after Hakani's, is considered to be Cevri ƒ∞brahim √áelebi's hilye, Hilye-i √áihar-Yar-ƒ± G√ºzin (1630), about the physical appearance of the first four caliphs. Another important hilye writer is Nesati Ahmed Dede (d. 1674), whose 184-verse long poem is about the physical characteristics of 14 prophets and Adam. Other notable hilyes are Dursunz√¢de Bakayi's Hilye't√ªl-Enbiya ve √áeyar-ƒ± G√ºz√Æn (hilye of the prophet and his four caliphs), Nahifi's (d. 1738) prose hilye N√ºzhet-√ªl-Ahyar fi Terc√ºment-i≈ü-≈ûem√Æl-i and Arif S√ºleyman Bey's (1761) Nazire-√Æ Hak√¢n√Æ. Hilyes can be written as standalone prose or poems (often in the masnavi form). They can also be part of two other forms of Turkish Islamic literature, a Mevlid (account of Muhammad's life) or a Mir'aj-name (accounts of Muhammad's Night Journey). Art form A hilye (1712) meant to be folded and carried on one's person (the crease lines are visible). The two crescents above and below the large circle in the middle contain the description of Muhammad. The central circle describes the protective powers of the hilye. The protective hand of Fatimah is also drawn on the lower crescent, as another sign against evil. The circle and the edges of the sheet are bordered with Koranic verses. While writers developed hilye as a literary genre, calligraphers and illuminators developed it into a decorative art form. Because of their supposed protective effect, a practice developed in Ottoman Turkey of the 17th century of carrying Muhammad's description on one's person. Similarly, because of the belief that a house with a hilye will not see poverty, trouble, fear or the devil, such texts came to be displayed prominently in a house. The term of hilye was used for the art form for presenting these texts. Thus, the hilye, as a vehicle for Muhammad's presence after his death, was believed to have a talismanic effect, capable of protecting a house, a child, a traveller, or a person in difficulty. In addition, the purpose of the hilye is to help visualize Muhammad as a mediator between the sacred and human worlds, to connect with him by using the viewing of the hilye as an opportunity to send a traditional blessing upon him, and to establish an intimacy with him. The pocket hilyes were written on a piece of paper, small enough to fit in a breast pocket after being folded in three. The folding lines were reinforced with cloth or leather. Other pocket hilyes were made of wood. Hilyes to be displayed on a wall were prepared on paper mounted on wooden panels, although in the 19th century, thick paper sheets became another medium. The top part of hilyes that were laid on wooded panels were carved and cut out in the form of a crown. The crown part would be richly illuminated and miniatures of Medina, the tomb of Muhammad or the Kabaa would be placed there, together or separately. Ottoman Turks have commissioned scribes to write hilyes in fine calligraphy and had them decorated with illuminators. Serving as a textual portraits of the prophets, hilye panels have decorated homes for centuries. These calligraphic panels were often framed and came to be used as wall decorations in houses, mosques and shrines, fulfilling an equivalent role to that played by images of Jesus in the Christian tradition. As symbolic art, they provided an aesthetically pleasing reminder of Muhammad's presence without involving the type of \\"graven image\\" unacceptable to most Muslims' sensitivities. Although not common,Another example of a triptych-like hilye is at: some hilyes show the influence of Orthodox Christian icon-making because they are made like triptychs with foldable side panels. The first recorded instance of Hilye-i Sherif panels is generally believed to have been prepared by the notable scribe H√¢fiz Osman (1642‚Äì1698). He was one of earliest scribes known to make such works, although it has been suggested that another famous scribe, Ahmed Karahisar√Æ (1468‚Äì1556), may have created one hilye panel about a century before. cited by Hafƒ±z Osman was known to have experimented with pocket hilyes in his youth, one of these dates from 1668. Its text was written in very small naskh script and has dimensions of 22x14 cm. It consisted of a description of Mohammad in Arabic, and below that its Turkish translation, written in diagonal, to create a triangular block of text. A characteristic feature of the texts shown at the centre of hilyes is their praise for the beauty of Muhammad's physical appearance and character. While containing a verbal description of what Muhammad looked like, a hilye leaves picturing Muhammad's appearance to the reader's imagination, in line with the mainly aniconic nature of Islamic art. =Standard layout= The standard layout for the Ottoman hilye panel is generally attributed to H√¢fiz Osman. This layout is generally considered to be the best and has come to be the classical form. It contains the following elements: Hilye by Kazasker Mustafa Izzet Efendi (1801‚Äì1876) *The ba≈ü makam (\\"head station\\"), a top panel containing a bismallah or blessing *The g√∂bek (\\"belly\\"), a round shape containing the first part of the main text in naskh script. It often contains the description of Muhammad by Ali (according to Tirmidhi), with minor variations(see quote in the Origins section above). *The hil√¢l (\\"crescent\\"), an optional section with no text, which is often gilded. A crescent encircling the g√∂bek, with its thick middle part at the bottom. Together, the g√∂bek and hilal also evoke the image of the sun and the moon. *The k√∂sheler (\\"corners\\"), usually four rounded compartments surrounding the g√∂bek, typically containing the names of the four Rashidun or \\"rightly-guided\\" Caliphs according to Sunnis, or in some cases other titles of Muhammad, names of his companions, or some of the names of Allah. *The ayet or ku≈üak (\\"verse\\" or \\"belt\\") section below the g√∂bek and crescent, containing a verse from the Quran, usually (\\"And We [God] did not send you [Muhammad] except to be a mercy to the universe\\"), or sometimes (\\"Truly, you [Muhammad] are of a tremendous nature\\") or (\\"And God is significant witness that Muhammad is the messenger of God\\"). *The etek (\\"skirt\\" or lower part) containing the conclusion of the text begun in the g√∂bek, a short prayer, and the signature of the artist. If the main text fits completely in the g√∂bek, the etek may be absent. *The koltuklar (\\"empty spaces\\"), two alleys or side panels on either side of the etek that typically contain ornamentation ‚Äì sometimes illuminated ‚Äì but no text, although occasionally the names of some of the ten companions of Muhammad are found there. *The i√ß and dƒ±≈ü pervaz (\\"inner and outer frame\\"), an ornamental border in correct proportion to the text. The remainder of the space is taken up with decorative Ottoman illumination, of the type usual for the period, often with a border framing the whole in a contrasting design to the main central field that is the background of the text sections. The \\"verse\\" and \\"corners\\" normally use a larger thuluth script, while the \\"head\\" section with the bismallah is written in muhaqqaq. Unlike the literary genre of hilye, the text on calligraphic hilyes is generally in prose form. The names in Turkish of the central structural elements of the hilye are, from top to bottom, ba≈ümakam (head station), g√∂bek (belly), ku≈üak (belt) and etek (skirt). This anthropomorphic naming makes it clear that the hilye represents a human body, whose purpose is \\"to recall semantically the Prophet's presence via a graphic construct\\". It has been suggested that Hafiz Osman's hilye design might have been inspired by the celebrated Hilye-i ≈ûerif, which in turn was based on the possibly spurious hadith according to which Muhammad has said \\"... Whoever sees my hilye after me is as though he has seen me... \\". If so, a hilye might have been meant to be not read but seen and contemplated, because it is really an image made of plain text. The standard Hilye-i ≈ûerif composition has been followed by calligraphers since its creation in the late 17th century. Some examples from the 19th century and two made by Hafiz Osman can be seen below.

Rose Hilye.jpgHilye in the shape of a pink rose (18th century). Popularity of the graphic form A hilye from 1718, similar to a Christian triptych. The middle panel is topped with a crown carving. The side panes list the 99 names of Allah. There are several reasons given for the popularity of graphic hilyes. Islam prohibits the depiction of graphic representations of people that may lead to idols. For this reason, Islamic art developed in the forms of calligraphy, miniatures and other non-figurative arts. In miniatures, Muhammad's face was either veiled or blanked. Because of the prohibition on drawing the face of Muhammad, the need to represent Muhammad was satisfied by writing his name and characteristics. Many authors have commented that another reason is the affection that Muslims feel for Muhammad, which leads them to read about his physical and moral beauty. The (apocryphal) hadith that those who memorize his hilye and keep it close to their heart will see Muhammad in their dreams would have been another reason. Muslim people's love for Muhammad is considered to be one of the reasons for the display of hilye panels at a prominent place in their homes (see Graphic art form section below). Hakani has said in his poem that a house with a hilye will be protected from trouble. Another motivation would have been the hadith given by Hakani in the Hilye-i ≈ûerif, which states that those who read and memorize Muhammad's hilye will attain great rewards in this and the other world, will see Muhammad in their dreams, will be protected from many disasters, and will receive Muhammad's esteem. In the \\"sebeb-i te'l√Æf\\" ve \\"h√¢time\\" section of the hilye, the writer gives the reasons to write the hilye. Hakani wrote that his reason was to be worthy of Muhammad's holy intercession (shefaat) on doomsday and to receive a prayer from willing readers. Other hilye writers express, usually at the end of the hilye, their desire to be commended to the esteem of Muhammad, the other prophets, or the four caliphs. One hilye writer, Hakim, wrote that he wishes that people will remember Muhammad as they look at his hilye. Hakani's Hilye-i ≈ûerif has been an object of affection to many Turkish people. His poem has been copied on paper as well as on wooden panels by many calligraphers and has been read with the accompaniment of music in Mawlid ceremonies. =Non-Ottoman forms= As an art form, hilye has mostly been restricted to Ottoman lands. A small number of instances of hilye panels were made in Iran, and they reflect a Shiite adaptation of the form: there is a Persian translation below the Arabic text and the names of the Twelve Imams are listed. In the 19th century, some Iranian hilyes combined the traditional hilye format with the Iranian tradition of pictorial representation of Muhammad and Ali.See this image for an example. There are contemporary exponents of the art outside this region, such as the Pakistani calligrapher Rasheed Butt and the American calligrapher Mohamed Zakariya. =Traditions= In Turkey, giving a hilye panel as a marriage gift for the happiness of the union and safety of the home has been a tradition that is disappearing. Covering such panels with sheer curtains was part of the religious folklore in Istanbul households. Since Osman's time, every Turkish calligrapher has been expected to produce at least one hilye, using the three muhaqqaq, thuluth and naskh scripts. It is a common tradition for masters of calligraphy to obtain their diploma of competency (icazetname) after completing a hilye panel as their final assignment. The art of hilye flourishes in Turkey. Contemporary artists continue to create hilyes in the classical form as well as to innovate. Modern hilyes maintain the essence of a hilye, even while the appearance of the elements of the hilye is customized or calligraphy is used to create abstract or figurative works. Contemporary hilyes are exhibited in major exhibitions in Turkey as well as outside the country. Theological opinion According to the S√ºleymaniye Vakfƒ±, a Salafi influenced religious foundation in Turkey that publishes religious opinions (fatwa), hilye panels are works of art, but hanging them in the home has no religious value. That is, they provide no merit to those who hang them or carry them on their persons, and those who do not possess them have no deficit. A key hilye in poetry: Hilye-i ≈ûerif Hilye-i ≈ûerif (\\"The Noble Description\\", 1598‚Äì1599) by Mehmet Hakani, consisting of 712 verses, lists Muhammad's features as reported by Ali (see quotation in the Origins section above), then comments on each of them in 12-20 verses. Although some have found it to be of not great poetic merit, it was popular due to its subject matter. The poem is significant for having established the genre of hilye. Later hilye writers such as Cevri, Nesati and Nafihi have praised Hakani and stated that they were following in his footsteps. The poem contains several themes detailed below that underscore the importance of reading and writing about the attributes of Muhammad. In his hilye, Hakani mentions the following hadith, which he attributes to Ali: A short time before Muhammad's death, when his crying daughter Fatima said to him: \\"Ya Rasul-Allah, I will not be able to see your face any more!\\" Muhammad commanded, \\"Ya Ali, write down my appearance, for seeing my qualities is like seeing myself.\\" The origin of this hadith is not known. Although probably apocryphal, it has had a fundamental effect on the development of the hilye genre. This hadith has been repeated by most other hilye writers. Hakani states another hadith, also attributed to Ali. This hadith of unknown origin is said to have been in circulation since the 9th century but is not found in the reliable hadith collections. Repeated in other hilyes after Hakani's, this hadith has been influential in the establishment of the genre.:, copy on author's website Hakani's hilye includes a story about a poor man coming to the Abbasid Caliph Harun al-Rashid and presenting him a piece of paper on which Muhammad's hilye is written. Al- Rashid is so delighted to see this that he regales the dervish and rewards him with sacs of jewelry. At night, he sees Muhammad in his dream. Muhammad says to him \\"you received and honored this poor man, so I will make you happy. God gave me the good news that whoever looks at my hilye and gets delight from it, presses it to his chest and protects it like his life, will be protected from hellfires on Doomsday; he will not suffer in this world nor in the other. You will be worthy of the sight of my face, and even more, of my holy lights.\\" It has become customary for other hilye authors that followed Hakani to mention in the introduction of their hilye (called havas-i hilye) the hadith that seeing Muhammad in one's dream is the same as seeing him. The Harun Al-Rashid story has also been mentioned frequently by other authors as well. These elements from Hakani's hilye have established the belief that reading and writing hilyes protects the person from all trouble, in this world as well as the next.

The book has a cover design and illustrations by Ryan Gillard and Keira Kinsella. The book is the first in the world to have been published by a crowd funding website which is solely dedicated to books, www.Unbound.co.uk. The book contains thirteen short stories linked by a common theme which emerges part way through the series. The concept for the stories came to Jones in a car - \\"I was actually driving across London and I think I got held up by a red traffic light and suddenly the phrase, \\"Evil machines\\", drifted across my mind and I thought \\"Well that's a good title and I could use that\\", so I went home and started writing the stories.\\" The stories became the libretto for an opera staged in Lisbon in 2008 and Jones always intended to re-write them. However other events intervened and he left them as-was until a conversation with Justin Pollard of Unbound prompted their publication several years after they were first written. The story listing is as follows: * The Truthful Phone * The Nice Bomb * The Lift That Took People to Places They Didn't Want to Go * Motorbike Thieves * The Kidnap Car * The Vacuum Cleaner That Was Too Powerful * The Train to Anywhere * The Rocket to Hell * The Dog Maker and Other Wonders * The Day Things Started to Go Wrong * The Castle of Imagination * The End of Life * The Love Machine The launch took place on Friday 4 November 2011 at the Adam Street Club, London, UK. The UK media celebrity Stephen Fry was an expected guest but unable to attend due to a late flight into Dubai. At the launch Jones indicated that \\"The Nice Bomb\\" and \\"The Lift That Took People to Places They Didn't Want to Go\\" were probably the two stories of which he was most fond. The stories generally feature a sting in the tail, with, for example, the UK City of Swindon being lampooned in \\"The Lift That Took People to Places They Didn't Want to Go\\".

Her mother Anna Maria Lane, an heiress, died when Maud was twelve years old.Susan Englander. \\"Younger, Maud,\\" American National Biography Online (February 2000). It was a prosperous, well-connected family; two of her sisters married Austrian barons, and her father moved to Paris in 1900.\\"Baroness' Will Filed for Probate,\\" San Francisco Call (March 31, 1910): 5. Maud Younger was educated in San Francisco and New York. At 31, she visited the New York College Settlement House, and began her work in activism. \\"I went to see it, stopped for a week, and stayed five years,\\" she recalled.Nancy Cott, The Grounding of Modern Feminism (Yale University Press 1987): p. 34  Labor activism  Younger took up the cause of working women. She took several waitressing jobs to investigate working conditions in restaurants, and joined the New York Waitresses' Union.Maud Younger, \\"Diary of an Amateur Waitress: An Industrial Problem from the Worker's Point of View,\\" McClure's Magazine 28(1907): 543‚Äì552. She was referred to as the millionaire waitress.\\" After the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, Younger went back to her hometown to pursue further work in labor organizing. She worked as a waitress to qualify for union membership, then organized the city's first Waitresses' Union. She was president of Waitresses' Union Local 48, and served as their delegate to the San Francisco Central Labor Council.Maud Younger, \\"Taking Orders: A Day as a Waitress in a San Francisco Restaurant,\\" Sunset: The Pacific Monthly 21 (October 1908) Younger also helped found the San Francisco Wage Earners' Suffrage League (WESL) in 1908, to ensure that the concerns of working women were not forgotten in pursuit of the vote. After California women won suffrage in 1911, Younger and the WESL worked for the eight-hour workday for women.Harriett Weston, \\"Maud Younger: San Francisco's Helen Gould,\\" The Interior 2 January 1913: pp. 13‚Äì14. Younger funded many of the legal aspects of this work, and was an impressive public face of the movement as well. At the 1911 Labor Day parade in San Francisco, she drove the WESL float, a wagon pulled by six white horses.  Suffrage activism  Younger traveled to New York to support striking garment workers in 1913, and happened to be in town to give a memorial keynote speech at the 1916 funeral of Inez Milholland Boissevain.Linda J. Lumsden, Inez: The Life and Times of Inez Milholland (Indiana University Press 2004): p. 175. She supported the suffrage movement in Nevada and in the South (her mother was from New Orleans), and joined the Congressional Union, the more militant suffrage organization headed by Alice Paul, later named the National Woman's Party. Younger served as chair of the lobbying committee and participated in NWP pickets at the White House demanding women's suffrage.  Later work  December 16, 1920 In late 1920, Maud Younger drove across the country alone, with a dog named Sandy; this trip made her one of the first women to do a solo coast-to-coast drive across America, the very first being Anita King. The trip from San Francisco to Washington DC took 38 days, hampered by excessive rain. She arrived in Washington on 20 December 1920.Thomas L. Karnes, Asphalt and Politics: A History of the American Highway System (McFarland 2009): pp. 21‚Äì23. After the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment secured the right to vote for American women, Younger (and others) turned to advocating for the Equal Rights Amendment.

Its benefice is united with those of St Mary the Virgin, Kirkby Lonsdale, Holy Trinity, Casterton, St John the Divine, Hutton Roof, All Saints, Lupton, St Peter, Mansergh, and the Holy Ghost, Middleton, to form the Kirkby Lonsdale Team Ministry. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. History The present church stands slightly to the south of a former chapel of ease that was in existence by 1610. This was rebuilt in 1815, but all that remains of it is a porch to the north of the present church, which is used as a shed. St Bartholomew's was built in 1892‚Äì93, and designed by the Lancaster firm of architects, Paley, Austin and Paley. The church cost ¬£3,000 (equivalent to ¬£ in ). Architecture =Exterior= The church is constructed in stone, with stone-slate roofs. Its plan consists of a four-bay nave, two-bay north and south aisles, a south porch, a south transept, a north organ loft and vestry, and a chancel. A tower stands on the crossing. The architectural style of the church is Perpendicular, freely expressed. The aisle windows have two or three lights, The window in the transept has two lights, and that in the organ loft has three lights. There is a three-light west window, and in the chancel is a five-light east window, and a two-light window on the south side. The south porch is gabled with a three-centred arch, above which is a niche containing a statue. On the southeast corner of the tower is a square stair turret. On the west side of the tower is a single-light window, with a clock face above it. The three-light bell openings are louvred. The parapet is embattled, and on top of the tower is a pyramidal roof surmounted by a tall cross. =Interior= The interior of the church is faced with ashlar stone. The two- bay arcades are carried on octagonal piers. Most of the furniture and fittings were designed by the architects, and carved by local craftsmen. In the church are Royal arms of 1815. The stained glass in the west window was made in 1893 by Powell's to a design by Harrington Mann. The glass elsewhere is by Shrigley and Hunt. The two-manual organ was made in 1903 by J. W. Walker. There is a ring of six bells. Five of these were cast by John Taylor of Loughborough, three of them in 1893, one in 1897, and one in 1964. The sixth bell was cast in 2003 by Eijsbouts.

His works frequently explore the individualistic qualities of the performers for whom they are written.

Gobi (cauliflower) Manchurian is the result of the adaptation of Chinese cooking and seasoning techniques to suit Indian tastes and has become a staple of Indian Chinese cuisine. The word Manchurian means native or inhabitant of Manchuria. It was originally developed by the Chinese community who have lived in Kolkata since the time of the British Raj. In its two-stage preparation, the first stage requires preparing a spiced corn flour batter, dipping cauliflower florets in it and deep frying them. In the second stage, the deep fried florets are saut√©ed with chopped onion, bell pepper, garlic, etc., in soy and chili sauce. There are two different variants of gobi Manchurian, dry and with gravy. Both variants are prepared by using common ingredients like cauliflower, corn flour, maida flour, spring onion, bell peppers, soy sauce, chili sauce, minced garlic, ground pepper, etc. and has typical garnish of spring onion. Some recipes call for use of monosodium glutamate (MSG) to increase the taste profile, though there are those who avoid it due to possible health issues. Its taste can vary from mild spicy to hot and fiery based on the recipe and personal preference. Variations =Gobi Manchurian dry= Semi-dry gobi manchurian It has cauliflower fritters in comparatively dry sauce like texture and is typically served and enjoyed as a snack or starter with tomato ketchup as dipping sauce.

Although the provincial Gazetteer still lists the \\"settlement\\" of Brexton, which was situated between the southeast end of Gun Lake and Gold Bridge, and three and a half miles north of Bralorne, this once busy town has mostly vanished though a few buildings remain. The old town site now sits mainly on private property. Access Brexton can be accessed via Highway 40 from Lillooet, or via an upgraded backroad from Pemberton and Whistler known as the Hurley Main, which uses a pass at the head of the Hurley River to access the valley of the upper Lillooet River north of Pemberton. History Like most of the communities which developed in this region, Brexton got its start, and its name, from gold mining. In June 1931 the Bridge River Exploration Company was incorporated. Its holdings consisted of 38 claims and fractions on the northeast side of the Hurley River, a tributary of the main branch of the Bridge River. \\"This is a showing with considerable possibilities,\\" noted a Department of Mines inspector; \\"there is every indication of a very large tonnage of ore, and with sufficient values for milling it would develop into a major operation.\\" Two years later the company reorganized as B. R. X.Gold Mines Limited, E.R. Shepherd managing director. In 1934 camp facilities at the California minesite were enlarged but, by the following year, were insufficient for the 26-man work force, most of whom found private accommodation in the tiny settlement of Fish Lake. In honor of the B.R.X. mines, it was named Brexton and first appeared as such on the maps in 1938. The usual small business establishments catered to the miners and, according to one account, Brexton was a lively town at its peak.http://www3.telus.net/bradian/brexton.htm For almost 20 years the B.R.X. Company explored its claims by diamond-drill and tunnel. In 1937 it had converted to electricity; the following year it had built a 100-ton mill. In that year the BRX/ARIZONA claim commenced and but quickly ended, with 425 grams of gold and 28 grams of silver from 4342 tonnes of ore in total coming out before the mine shut down.BC MINFILE Record Summary No 092JNE024, ARIZONA (L.3176), BRX Another claim, known as \\"Gloria Kitty\\", produced 467 grams of gold and 311 grams of silver from 4343 tonnes of ore in the same year.BC MINFILE Record Summary No. No 092JNE022, GLORIA KITTY (L.3171), BRX, NATIONAL, ARIZONA Initial interest in these and adjoining properties dated back to 1897; operations were suspended in 1946.

Originally published online in 2005 on Jinjiang Original Network (), it was later published by Ocean Press (), National Press (), Huashan Arts Press (), Hunan Literature and Art Publishing House (), and Yeren Culture Publishing (). Tong Hua revised the novel in 2009 and 2011. The latest edition contained an additional 30,000 word epilogue. The story features a twenty-first century woman who gets transported back in time to the court dramas of the late Kangxi reign of the Qing dynasty. The novel was most prominently adapted as the television series Scarlet Heart, and was later also adapted into a radio drama, feature, film, stage play and a Korean drama. Synopsis Twenty-first century woman, Zhang Xiao, encountered traffic collision after work that sent her back in time to the Qing Dynasty during the Kangxi Emperor's reign (in the year 1704). She found herself trapped in the body of a young daughter of a Manchu aristocrat, Ma'ertai Ruoxi, younger sister of Ma'ertai Ruolan, who was a concubine of the emperor's eighth son, Yinsi. Stranded in the past, Ruoxi became acquainted with Kangxi's other sons, including the fourth prince Yinzhen and his full brother, the fourteenth prince Yinti. She forged a close friendship with the thirteenth prince, Yinxiang. Using charm and wit, Ruoxi won the emperor's favor and became his lady-in-waiting, attending to the monarch and his family. During Ruoxi's stay in the Forbidden City, she and Yinsi developed a mutual attraction. She initially rejected him but later agreed to marry him if he gave up his ambition for the throne. Ruoxi knew that Yinsi's path will ultimately lead to his lifelong imprisonment after Yinzhen became emperor. Yinsi refused and Ruoxi warned him to be wary of Yinzhen, providing him a list of those who would support his ascension. After breaking up with Yinsi, Ruoxi fell in love with Yinzhen. Meanwhile, Yinsi and his supporters, acting on Ruoxi's advice, framed Yinzhen for plotting against the crown prince Yinreng. Yinxiang took the blame and was sentenced to house arrest. After this incident, Yinsi discovered that Ruoxi was romantically involved with Yinzhen. The battle for the throne became inflamed when Yinreng's other crimes later came to light. The crown prince lost both his position and freedom. Kangxi then began to show preference for Yinti and offered Ruoxi as a concubine to him. Ruoxi, however, declined. Outraged by her boldness, the emperor demoted her to the laundry department. Kangxi eventually died of illness. With military support from Longkodo and Nian Gengyao; Yinzhen staged a coup and seized the throne from Yinti to become the Yongzheng Emperor. Yinzhen then released Yinxiang from custody and began a romantic relationship with Ruoxi. In an attempt to keep the secret that Yinti was named heir before their father's death, Yinzhen placed him under house arrest. Ruoxi is often caught between the rival factions. The ninth son, Yintang, manipulated Yinsi's wife Gororo Minghui into telling Ruoxi that Yinsi acted against Yinzhen years earlier. Ruoxi was shocked by this revelation, and in addition, remembering Yinzhen told her once that he initially had no desire to become an emperor, she realizes her actions inadvertently shaped events (see predestination paradox). Her despair invoked miscarriage and she descended into illness. Enraged, Yinzhen blamed Yinsi and his wife, issuing an edict forcing them to divorce, which led the latter to commit suicide. Remorseful of the consequences, Ruoxi confessed the truth to Yinzhen and Yinxiang, leading Yinzhen to treat her coldly. Ruoxi is unable to withstand the mental stress and asked Yinti to help her leave the palace. Yinsi knew that Yinzhen would not allow Ruoxi to leave and decided to intervene. He disclosed details of his past romance and an angered Yinzhen allowed Ruoxi to leave. Ruoxi's emotional anguish affected her health. She begged Yinti to send a letter to Yinzhen, requesting to see the emperor one last time before she dies. However, a misunderstanding caused the letter to be thrown aside unread. After three days, Ruoxi concluded that Yinzhen's absence confirmed that his love for her has faded, and she died (in the year 1725 at the age 35). When news of Ruoxi's death reached Yinzhen, he rushed to Yinti's house, regretting his actions after learning that Ruoxi still loved him. Blaming Yinsi and Yintang for Ruoxi's death, Yinzhen charged his half-brothers for ambiguous offenses and banished them from the imperial household. Both would eventually die in 1726, as Ruoxi predicted. History remained unchanged.

The blocks have since been renamed Herberton Apartments, but the area is still referred to locally as Fatima, which is the name of the adjacent Luas Red Line tram stop. History Work on the original complex started before World War II under the direction of Dublin Corporation (now Dublin City Council) but construction was held up due to material shortages. The first phase of construction was finally completed after the war and the first tenants began to move in in 1947: the development consisted of fifteen blocks, each of four floors in height. They replaced tenement housing for the area's working-class residents, and provided a great improvement in living conditions. Unfortunately in the mid 1980s the area became notorious for its high levels of heroin use and drug dealing, which eventually led to the original complex's demolition due to the drug problem's severity.

The fort was situated on the west side of the Columbia River, across from the mouth of the Pend Oreille River, southwest of Trail. It was originally called Fort Pend Oreille after the River. in 1859,the post was renamed in honor of their company governor who died that year. The border had been set at 49¬∞ North Latitude by the Oregon Boundary Treaty of 1846. After ten years of operating Fort Colvile on U.S. soil, the Hudson‚Äôs Bay Company, feeling the pain of U.S. taxes, decided to relocate in Canada. Angus MacDonald established Fort Pend Oreille right across from the mouth of Pend Oreille River. He thought this location was just north of the border but could not be sure until it was surveyed by John Sullivan in 1860. The company had planned to close Fort Colvile. But, after discovering that the gravely terrace at the new post was not conducive to agriculture, they continued to operate the southern fort for another fifteen years, just to produce the vegetables and hay they needed up north. Fort Pend Oreille comprised several log buildings on the left bank of a tiny ephemeral creek where the terrace was wider upstream from the Pend Oreille. The buildings included a store, two warehouses, barracks for employees, and a cabin to serve as quarters for the factor and his officers. They were all constructed of squared, hand-hewn logs, well notched and tightly fitted at the corners. The buildings that were occupied had double-hung glass windows, stone chimneys and were neatly arranged around an open area, much like a parade ground at a military fort.

The church, known as Santuario del Volto Santo, is part of a monastery belonging to Capuchin friars. There have been claims that the cloth is the Veil of Veronica. Background According to local tradition, an anonymous pilgrim arrived in Manopello in 1508 with the cloth wrapped in a package. The pilgrim gave the package to Dr. Giacomo Antonio Leonelli, who was sitting on a bench in front of the church. The doctor went into the church and unwrapped the package, discovering the veil. He immediately left the church to find the pilgrim but could not trace him. The veil was owned by the Leonelli family for a century. In 1608, Pancrazio Petrucci, a soldier married to Marzia, a member of the Leonelli family, stole the veil from his father-in-law‚Äôs house. A few years later, Marzia sold it for 400 scudi to Doctor Donato Antonio De Fabritiis to pay a ransom demand for her husband who was a prisoner in Chieti. The veil was given by De Fabritiis to the Capuchins who currently hold it today. This history has been documented by Father Donato da Bomba in his Relatione historica and is based on research that had been started in 1640. In 1999, German Jesuit Heinnrich Pfeiffer, Professor of Art History at the Pontifical Gregorian University,Excerpt of Il Volto Santo di Manoppello (The Holy Face of Manoppello), published by Carsa Edizioni in Pescara (page 13) accessed March 2013 announced at a press conference in Rome his discovery of the veil in the church of the Capuchin monastery, where it had been since 1660. Pfeiffer had in fact been promoting this image for many years before.Ian Wilson, Holy Faces, Secret Places, page 161 Pfeiffer claims that the image is the Veil of Veronica. He suggests that it was stolen from the Vatican during rebuilding that took place in 1506, before the Sacking of Rome. He further suggests the cloth was placed over Jesus' face in the tomb and that the image was a byproduct of the forces unleashed during Jesus' resurrection ‚Äì forces, he believes, that also formed the image on the Shroud of Turin. Additionally, he has proposed a history of the veil going back to the first century. His narrative, however, is unsupported by evidence. There is no substantiated evidence connecting the cloth with Rome or the crucifixion. However, some have observed bits of glass embedded in the cloth, suggesting a connection between it and its former glass container in St. Peter's, reputed to have been smashed open when the cloth was stolen. Nevertheless, the cloth has received much publicity in recent years and Pope Benedict XVI visited the veil on 1 September 2006. Likewise, Pfeiffer's claims as to the purported impossibility of painting on byssus cloth have been conclusively debunked. In fact, the 16th century art historian Giorgio Vasari wrote in his book that the German artist Albert Durer was painting in watercolours on byssus silk and sent his portrait as a gift to Raphael in honor of his work from the second edition of the works of Giorgio Vasari La Giuntina. Origins Church of the Volto Santo di Manoppello, housing the Holy Face image. The cloth has been claimed to be made of a rare fiber called byssus, which is a natural fiber coming from a bivalve mollusc Pinna nobilis, woven into sea silk, and used by ancient people mainly around the Mediterranean coasts.Phyllis Tortora & Robert Merkel (Editors), 1996, Fairchild's Dictionary of Textiles, page 82 Paul Badde, the Vatican correspondent for Die Welt, claims this is a kind of fabric which would usually only be found in the graves of Egyptian pharaohs,Inside the Vatican, October 2004 but byssus fabric (or sea silk) has never been exclusive to ancient Egyptians and was considered a high quality fabric made by the Phoenicians, Greek, the Romans,Tr.

A further objection, advanced by Ian Wilson, is that because the image does not bear a familial resemblance to known copies (see above), it cannot be the version of the Veronica that was venerated in the Middle Ages. Paul Badde, journalist for the German newspaper Die Welt, in his 2010 book The Face of God, differs with Wilson's statements, comparing images he claims were made before 1608 of an open-eyed and open-mouthed man just like the Manoppello image.Paul Badde (2010).

Urban legend theories Superposition of the Veil of Manoppello on a negative of the Shroud of Turin Fanti and Jaworski claim in a paperFanti and Jaworski article that the face on the Manoppello Image has numerous \\"interesting analogies\\" (page 1) with the face presented on the Shroud of Turin although \\"their shapes and sizes are not identical\\" (page 5). They claim that 3D properties of the Manoppello Image (similar to that of the Shroud, but weaker) have been discovered. They also conclude that the characteristics \\"speak in favor of the Acheropita image\\" (on page 1). In other words, the theory of the image being not made by human means, which is in contradiction with the studies by R. FalcinelliThe Third Dallas International Conference on the Shroud of Turin, Dallas, September 8‚Äì11, 2005 who is an expert in photography and claims instead that the Manoppello image is rather a manmade painted artifact that would be reminiscent of existing iconography. Gian Marco Rinaldi from the Italian Committee for the Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CICAP) goes as far as to say that the theory according to which there would not be any trace of pigment on the Manoppello Image is nothing but an \\"urban legend\\", which takes its roots from internet sites and blogs as well as from the public statements of religious authorities in Italy and many articles from Paul Badde in Die Welt, all of whom have extrapolated dubiously the works of Donato Vittore and Giulio Fanti. Fanti, although being pro- authenticity, has never claimed that there weren't any traces of pictural pigments; he only stated in his papers that the manner in which the image was made is not known to him and that the image has not been made by weaving \\"colored thread\\".http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/jaworski.pdf Fanti and his collaborators claimed that certain parts did contain pigments but, when zooming to a certain extent between the fibers, pigments were not found between them but only on the fabric's surface, due to the intrinsic characteristics of the extremely fine byssus fabric. Rinaldi insists upon the fact that Fanti and his associates never said in any paper whatsoever that the Manoppello Image corresponded \\"exactly\\" to the Turin Shroud, and that such an extrapolated statement has only been made public by sister Blandine Schl√∂mer, a Trappist nun from Manopello in charge of communicating with the media. Rinaldi shows that Fanti changed his theory many times, claiming pigments were absent, then only visible in particular zones such as the eyes and finally that, yes, it contains pigments but only the manner they were deposited on the byssus is unknown to him. These never-ending adjustments of the pro- authenticity arguments may have led some to extrapolate to such a degree, according to Rinaldi.\\"La legenda del colore che non c'era\\" (the legend of the non-existent paint) by G.M.

Arthur George Maule Ramsay, 14th Earl of Dalhousie JP (4 September 1878 ‚Äì 23 December 1928), styled Lord Ramsay between 1880 and 1887, was a Scottish peer and soldier. Early life Ramsay was born at Atkinson's Hotel, Torquay, Devon, the eldest of five sons of John Ramsay, 13th Earl of Dalhousie, and Lady Ida Louisa Bennet, daughter of Charles Bennet, 6th Earl of Tankerville. His brother Hon. Sir Patrick Ramsay (1879‚Äì1962) became a senior diplomat, and another brother was Admiral Hon. Sir Alexander Ramsay (1881‚Äì1972), a senior royal navy officer who married Princess Patricia of Connaught. Lord Ramsay was educated at Eton College and the University College, Oxford. He succeeded in the earldom in 1887 on the death of his father. Military career Lord Dalhousie was attached to the Forfar and Kincardine Artillery, a Militia regiment, when he was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Scots Guards on 10 February 1900. Following the outbreak of the Second Boer War in late 1899, the 2nd battalion Scots Guards were posted to South Africa as reinforcements in April 1900. He served there with the battalion until the end of the war, and was promoted a lieutenant on 14 December 1901. The war ended with the Peace of Vereeniging in June 1902, and Lord Dalhousie left Port Natal with other men of the 2nd battalion Scots Guards on the SS Michigan in late September 1902, arriving at Southampton in late October, when the battalion was posted to Aldershot. He later fought as a Captain in the First World War. He was a Justice of the Peace for Forfarshire, and was commissioned a Deputy Lieutenant of the county in December 1901.

By definition, it is described as a \\"direct translation of a data waveform to the audible domain.\\" Audification interprets a data sequence and usually a time series, as an audio waveform where input data are mapped to sound pressure levels. Various signal processing techniques are used to assess data features. The technique allows the listener to hear periodic components as frequencies. Audification typically requires large data sets with periodic components. Audification is most commonly applied to get the most direct and simple representation of data from sound and to convert it into a visual. In most cases it will always be used for taking sounds and breaking it down in a way that we can visually understand it and construct more data from it.  History  The idea of audification was introduced in 1992 by Greg Kramer, initially as a sonification technique. This was the beginning of audification, but is also why most people to this day still consider audification a type of sonification. The goal of audification is to allow the listener to audibly experience the results of scientific measurements or simulations. A 2007 study by Sandra Pauletto and Andy Hunt at the University of York suggested that users were able to detect attributes such as noise, repetitive elements, regular oscillations, discontinuities, and signal power in audification of time-series data to a degree comparable with visual inspection of spectrograms.  Applications  Applications include audification of seismic data and of human neurophysiological signals. An example is the esophageal stethoscope, which amplifies naturally occurring sound without conveying inherently noiseless variables such as the result of gas analysis. = Medicine = Converting ultrasound to audible sound is a form of audification that provides a form of echolocation. Other uses in the medical field include the stethoscope and the audification of an EEG. = Music = The development of electronic music can also be considered the history of audification. This is because all electronic instruments involve electric process audified using a loudspeaker. = Seismology = Audification is of interest for research into Auditory Seismology. It is used in earthquake prediction. Applications include using seismic data to differentiate bomb blasts from earthquakes. The technique presents sound waves of earthquakes alongside a visual representation. The addition of audio allows both the eye and ears to contribute to better understanding. = NASA = NASA has used audification to represent radio and plasma wave measurements.  Sonification  Both sonification and audification are representational techniques in which data sets or its selected features are mapped into audio signals. However, audification is a kind of sonification, a term which encompasses all techniques for representing data in non-speech audio. Their relationship can be demonstrated in the way data values in some sonifications that directly define audio signals are called audification.

Looking southbound towards the crash site (2006). On 4 November 2011, a multiple-vehicle collision occurred on the M5 motorway near Taunton, Somerset, in South West England. The crash involved dozens of cars and articulated lorries, and a large fireball ensued. Seven people were killed and 51 others were injured, making the pile-up the deadliest on a British motorway since 13 people ‚Äì 12 of them children ‚Äì died in a minibus crash on the M40 in 1993. In October 2012, a man who had organised and was operating a fireworks display for Guy Fawkes Night at Taunton Rugby Club's ground, which is adjacent to the motorway, was charged with seven counts of manslaughter. In January 2013, the manslaughter charges were dropped and instead he faced a single charge under health and safety laws of failing to ensure the safety of others. In December 2013 he was found not guilty of the charge. In April 2014, the West Somerset coroner concluded that the accident was caused by dense fog, and that smoke from fireworks may have been a contributory factor, but was not the prime cause of the incident. Circumstances At 8:25 pm on Friday 4 November 2011, 34 vehicles were involved in a pile-up on the northbound carriageway of the M5 motorway near junction 25 at Bathpool and Creech St Michael, northeast of Taunton. The vehicles included cars, vans and lorries, some of which exploded and started a fire. Flames rose up to high. Fifty-one people were injured and seven were later confirmed dead. Sixteen casualties were treated at Musgrove Park Hospital in Taunton and 26 at Yeovil District Hospital. A surgeon was flown by helicopter from the major trauma centre at the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital to cope with the load and the types of multi-system trauma, including multiple fractures and chest, abdominal and lung injuries. Fifteen fire engines from Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service attended, travelling from stations across the region. By 8:30 am on 6 November the emergency services had removed the vehicles from the crash site, but both carriageways of the motorway, between junctions 24 and 25, remained closed for repair work. The fatalities had not yet been formally identified. of the road was damaged by fuel spillage from vehicles, and of it was damaged by intense fire and explosions. Two lanes of the southbound carriageway reopened at about 5 pm on 6 November, and the motorway was fully re-opened in both directions four hours later, in time for the Monday morning rush-hour. Aftermath and reaction One of the lorries involved was from the food company Samworth Brothers, and another was from Samworth subsidiary Ginsters. Two of the company's drivers were killed and another was injured in the crash. On 8 November, the seven people who died were named: lorry drivers Terry Brice and Kye Thomas; father and daughter Michael and Maggie Barton; grandparents Anthony and Pamela Adams; and Malcolm Beacham. One eyewitness described the scene of the crash, saying: \\"It was a horrific accident. There were a number of explosions and black smoke. It's not something you expect to see on the motorway, it was more like a scene from Afghanistan.\\" Investigation Initially, an assistant chief constable of Avon and Somerset Constabulary, Anthony Bangham, told reporters that it was feared more bodies were still trapped in badly-burnt vehicles, some of which had been \\"burnt to the ground\\" and were unrecognisable. After an overnight forensic search no further bodies were found. Police stated that a fireworks display taking place at Taunton Rugby Club just before the accident occurred was a \\"major line of inquiry\\", as \\"a blanket of thick smoke\\", which could have drifted from the display, was lying across the motorway at the time of the crash. The club's location was described as only \\"a few hundred metres\\" away from the M5. Bangham went on to say: \\"Accountability is clearly something we will look at ... it is a crime investigation as well as a road policing investigation.\\" He added that driving conditions were \\"difficult\\", and that there was fog in the area at the time of the accident. Justine Greening, the Transport Secretary, told the House of Commons that it might take weeks to determine the cause of the crash. An inquest into the deaths was opened at the Old Municipal Building in Taunton on 10 November. A report by consultants Balfour Beatty-Mott McDonald into warning systems on the motorway in April 2010 advised the Highways Agency to upgrade the current fog warning system, which must be manually activated if fog is seen on the road, either via CCTV or from police calling in to the control centre. On the night of the crash, the agency said it did not receive any such reports, so the signs were not switched on.M5 report identified fog risk before crash BBC News, 12 December 2011. Retrieved 28 December 2011. On 13 March 2012, following media reports that interim findings from the investigation showed fog rather than drifting smoke was to blame, police issued a statement to clarify that they had not published any conclusions to the investigation. =Prosecution= On 19 October 2012, Geoffrey Counsell, a 50-year-old man from Somerset who had provided the fireworks display at Taunton Rugby Club, was charged with seven counts of manslaughter. He appeared at Bristol magistrates' court on 12 November and was bailed until 4 December when he appeared at Bristol Crown Court for an initial preliminary hearing. Counsell was bailed again until an additional preliminary hearing at the court on 15 January 2013. At 15 January hearing the manslaughter charges against Counsell were dropped. He instead was charged with a single count of failing to ensure the safety of others, under health and safety laws. His trial began on 19 November and concluded on 10 December when the judge directed the jury to find him not guilty of the charge, stating that Counsell had \\"no case to answer\\" and that there was not sufficient evidence that he should have foreseen smoke from the display might drift and mix with fog to form thick smog. After the trial Counsell criticised the police and local council for being \\"motivated by a desire to find someone to blame for this terrible accident, simply for the sake of it\\", saying that the Highways Agency, Taunton Deane Borough Council and Avon and Somerset police were all consulted before the event but \\"no objection of any kind was raised\\".  Consultation to increase motorway speed limit  At the time of the accident, the issue of the UK motorway speed limit was being debated widely in politics and the media, with proposals to increase it from 70 mph to 80 mph. The accident put a swift end to this debate; the speed limit has remained 70 mph ever since, with no calls to change it.

On gravel roads, frozen lakes, permanent road courses, or temporary street circuits, RealTime drivers have piloted Acura and Honda production- based automobiles to 18 professional titles in a variety of motorsports series. International Ice Racing Association (1987 ‚Äì 1990) The team campaigned a variety of Honda Civic automobiles in the International Ice Racing Association, leading to IIRA titles for Cunningham in 1987, 1989 and 1990. SCCA Pro Rally (1992 ‚Äì 1993) RTR focused its energies on SCCA PRO Rally in 1992 and 1993. Fielding an Acura Integra GS-R, Cunningham won the Production Category National Championship and the prestigious Woodner Cup in 1993. SCCA World Challenge (1993 ‚Äì current) At the close of the 2012 season, RealTime Racing has earned a record 85 race victories on 27 different tracks in World Challenge competition. Those victories are shared over three categories (GT, GTS and Touring Car) and 11 different drivers. RTR first entered the SCCA Pro Racing sanctioned World Challenge Championships in 1993 with a Honda Prelude Si in the Touring Car Category (at the time known as Class C, then renamed Super Production in 1994 and Touring 2 in 1996, finally becoming Touring Car in 1999). The team finished second in the Drivers‚Äô Championship in 1993 and 1994 with Cunningham, before winning back-to-back championships in 1995 and 1996 with Cunningham and Michael Galati, respectively. The team's success propelled Honda to four-straight Manufacturers‚Äô Championships from 1993 ‚Äì 1996. In 1997, the team's World Challenge Touring Car program transitioned to the Acura Integra Type R. RealTime drivers won championships with this model in 1997 (Pierre Kleinubing), 1998 (Galati), 2000 (Kleinubing), 2001 (Kleinubing) and 2002 (Cunningham). The strength of RealTime's Integra program gave Acura its first four World Challenge Manufacturers‚Äô Championships: 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2002. The Integra Type R would go down as the most successful car model in the history of the World Challenge Touring Car category, scoring more wins, poles and championships than any other model before or since. A winning example of RealTime's Integra Type R resides in the Honda museum. In the midst of the Acura Integra Type R's success, RTR added a World Challenge GT (then called Touring 1) program to its stable, campaigning a normally-aspirated Acura NSX. The car won eight races between the 1996 ‚Äì 1998 World Challenge seasons and Cunningham won the GT Drivers‚Äô Championship in 1997 with the car. In 2000, to complement Cunningham's efforts with the BMW factory team in the American Le Mans Series, RTR expanded its World Challenge lineup to include a BMW M3 in the GT Championship. In its first BMW venture, the team scored five front-row starting positions and four podium finishes, including a race win at St. Croix, all with Cunningham at the wheel. The team upgraded the Acura NSX to a supercharged model for the World Challenge GT category from 2001 ‚Äì 2002. The team earned six wins with this car and finished second in the 2001 and 2002 Drivers‚Äô Championships with Cunningham. The RealTime Acura NSX is also on display in the Honda Museum. In 2003, RealTime began its campaign of the Acura RSX in Touring Car. The team won three races with the RSX in the model's debut season and finished second in the Drivers‚Äô Championship with Kleinubing. The race debut of the Acura TSX came in 2004, but as the team worked to develop the TSX, the RSX continued to play a significant role in the World Challenge Touring Car Championship through 2008. Peter Cunningham's Acura TSX at Road Atlanta. The first generation TSX would go on to score championships for Cunningham in 2005 and 2008, and for Kleinubing in 2006. The second generation TSX made its debut in 2009 and netted another Drivers‚Äô Championship for Kleinubing. The TSX maintained Acura and RealTime's legacy of success in World Challenge, scoring Manufacturers‚Äô Championships in 2005, 2006, 2008 and 2009. RTR moved to the new GTS category in 2010 with Cunningham and Nick Esayian each taking home race victories that year. The team briefly and successfully added a Honda Civic Si to their stable at the Grand Prix of Toronto where driver Nick Wittmer won the Touring Car race. RealTime took home both the Drivers‚Äô Championship and the Manufacturers‚Äô Championship for Acura in 2010, but as the competition intensified and the category grew, the decision was made to upgrade the TSX to a V6 platform in 2012. The V6-powered TSX steered the team to another Drivers‚Äô Championship for Cunningham and Acura's record- extending 10th Manufacturers‚Äô Championship. In 2014, RealTime switched to the new Acura TLX, entering a factory-backed car in the GT class at the Mid-Ohio and Sonoma rounds, with Peter Cunningham claiming a best result of 13th. In 2015 the team fielded two full-time entries for Cunningham and Ryan Eversley. The latter won the first St. Petersburg race and finished sixth in the GT class drivers classification, whereas Cunningham ended 14th. Eversley continued as full-time driver in 2016, winning the two Road America races. Cunningham raced the first half of the season, claiming a runner-up finish at Road America race 1, then Spencer Pumpelly took his place for the last three rounds. The TLX GT3 will be replaced by the Acura NSX GT3 in 2017, whereas Eversley's teammate will be Peter Kox.

Various famous people and politicians have visited including singer Johnny Mathis, U.S. Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio, and former Vice President Dan Quayle. History In 1936 with a Kewpee already located in Findlay, Ohio, Hoyt ‚ÄúStub‚Äù Wilson, the Lima Kewpee licensee, opened a restaurant there called Wilson's Sandwich Shop. The original building was yellow and narrow as a subway car. It was example of the \\"enamel steel road food culture\\" and could host 32 people. Due to World War II meat rationing, all three of Hoyt Wilson's restaurants added the \\"Veggie\\", a special with out the meat patty and a historically notable vegetable sandwich. Wilson's estate sold ownership in the 1960s to three managers: Wilbur Fenbert, Harold \\"Lance\\" Baker and Woodie Curtis with the Lima Kewpees going to their manager. In the middle of that same decade, a new building was constructed. The original building stayed open by being moved to the back of the lot. With the deaths of Baker and Curtis, their spouses took over their ownership interests. In 2008, then Vice Presidential candidate Joe Biden stopped there while on the campaign trail. Wilson's faced possible closure in 2009 with the downturn in the economy and Occupational Safety and Health Administration fines over their hamburger patty molding machine potentially pinching operators, and electrical shock or electrocution. With training and safety precautions not affordable, the then manager Mike Fenbert ceased using the machine and moved to purchase premade patties. By March 2010, A new patty machine was purchased to make the patties in house once again.

The Constitution provides a legal establishment of the structure and various roles of administration of the Queen of Barbados (often referred to as The Crown, and represented by the Governor-General), the Government of Barbados, as well as legal rights and responsibilities of the public and various other government officers. The Constitution which came into force in 1966 was amended in 1974,1974 Amendment 1978, 1990, 1992, 1995, 2002, and 2003.2003 AmendmentConstitutional amendments The 1966 document succeeds several other documents concerning administration of Barbados. One of them, the Barbados Charter, is discussed in the present Constitution's Preamble. Prior statutes were created for the administration of Barbados as a colony. As a former English and later British colony, the Constitution is similar to those of other Commonwealth realms, yet distinctly different in the spirit of the Statute of Westminster. In recent years there has been some dialogue on whether Barbados should undertake a process of patriating the constitution to cease the foundation being a 1966 Act of the British House of Commons. History =Early history= In 1625 the English landed at Barbados and carved the term 'For King James of E. and this island' on a tree, then some personal items were left behind, and the ship's crew returned to England to notify The Crown and to seek initial settlers. In 1627 the initial settlers landed at Barbados and formed a colony based entirely on common law. As the population of Barbados grew a General Assembly was created and began to draft laws. After conflict in England erupted during the English Civil War, and large numbers of English settlers moved to Barbados, the General Assembly began the practice of creating a distinctly Barbados-based administration. =Recent history= As a constituent province of the West Indies Federation, Barbados became independent of the United Kingdom on 30 November 1966 under the Barbados Independence Act 1966. Elizabeth II issued an Order in Council, the Barbados Independence Order 1966, which formally enacted the present constitution. = Amendments = The Constitution may be amended by Act of Parliament.

Church, Parliament and Commonwealth  In March 1643 Robert Brewster was at once appointed to the Suffolk Committee for the enforcement of the Ordinance for sequestration of the estates of notorious delinquents, and in June Robert and Francis Brewster were named to an additional Suffolk committee for the raising of money to support the Parliamentary army.Acts and Ordinances, pp. 106-17 and pp. 168-71 (British History Online). In August Robert was appointed one of the representatives for Suffolk to the Committee (called \\"Deputy Lieutenants\\") for the Associated Counties (Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, Hertford, Huntingdon and Cambridge, and the City of Norwich) for the arrangement of their defence against rebellious or papistical armies, including that of the Earl of Newcastle.Acts and Ordinances, pp. 242-45 (British History Online). He was thereafter concerned with the raising of levies to support the Parliamentary forces, and in June 1646 was named as a deputy to adjudge scandalous offences deserving exclusion from the Sacrament by the Elderships of congregations.Acts and Ordinances, pp. 852-55 (British History Online). In 1645 Robert Brewster was elected Member of Parliament for Dunwich as a recruiter to the Long Parliament. Dunwich customarily had two Members, and at first he sat with Anthony Bedingfield. In 1644, pursuant to the Act for the appointment of local committees to investigate scandalous ministers, a Suffolk committee consisting of Alexander Bence, Squire Bence, William Blois, Francis Brewster, Robert Brewster, Sir Edward Duke, William Heveningham, Sir William Playters, Edward Read, William Rivet and Sir John Rous (1586-1662) had been appointed. As a result William Fenn, parson of Theberton, was summoned to appear at the King's Head in Beccles to be inquired into: Sir Robert Brooke (of Cockfield Hall), Robert Brewster Esquire and Francis Brewster, gent., were among the signatories to the warrant, styling themselves \\"Deputy Lieutenants\\" and \\"Committee of Parliament\\". Numerous charges, mostly of a political nature, were brought against Fenn who was accordingly ejected, and died in 1651.H.M.

Having survived Pride's Purge, Robert sat alone for Dunwich in the Rump Parliament until 1653. Dunwich was not represented at all in the Barebones Parliament of 1653, but Robert's son Francis Brewster sat for the County in that assembly. In 1654 Robert was elected as sole representative for Dunwich in the First Protectorate Parliament, but in 1656 the seat was occupied by Francis, while Robert himself sat for Suffolk: he supported the move to offer the Crown to Oliver Cromwell. In the Third Protectorate Parliament of 1659 he sat for Dunwich again, with the second seat restored and occupied by John Barrington.T.

Robert's brother Humphrey Brewster (1602-1669), of Hedenham, Norfolk, and later of Beccles, became Lieutenant-Colonel in the Parliamentary Army, raised and commanded a troop of horse, and was Governor of Landguard Fort in 1659-1660.J.H. Leslie, The History of Landguard Fort, in Suffolk (Eyre and Spottiswoode, London 1898), p. 94 (Internet Archive).  Hindolveston  Robert Brewster acquired the manor of Hindolveston in Norfolk, which had belonged to the Dean and Chapter of the Cathedral Church of Norwich. Since the time of Henry VIII, under a long lease, the stewards had permitted the usual manorial fines to be levied at the fixed rate of sixpence per acre. Brewster began to levy fines at arbitrary rates, which the copyholders refused to pay. In 1650-1653 (represented by Mr Bedingfield) he brought Chancery litigation against them under their champion Sir Edward Astley (died 1653) of Hindolveston (represented by Mr Calthorpe): his claim was dismissed.The National Archives (UK), Chancery Final Decrees, C 78/553, no. 2 (1653), images 278-294. In English. He resumed this against the copyholders in 1655-1658, naming them all in his suit, and accusing them of forming a confederacy to detain the old manorial court rolls, and of having altered the landscape by ploughing to such an extent that the enclosures could not be assessed properly. For their part the copyholders asked the court to uphold the customary usage as of common law, which in November 1658 it did, throwing Brewster's case out of court entirely.The National Archives (UK), Chancery Final Decrees, C 78/716, no. 16 (1658), rots 38-34.

He was succeeded by his son Francis Brewster (MP), who died in 1671, and was himself succeeded as master of Wrentham Hall by his brother Robert (died 1681).Burke, Landed Gentry (1862), I, p. 148 (Google). \\"1671\\" misprinted as \\"1761\\".

The signs of trouble are their hostility towards each other and conflicting opinions about whether Jessica, Rebecca's only daughter who has a different father, should receive equal stock shares of the family business as her two half-brothers. It is revealed that Mason had previously attempted to, and possibly succeeded in sexually assaulting Jessica. Rebecca feels an emotional emptiness and confides in her two lesbian best friends that she has never had an orgasm, and that she and Mason only have sex once every six months, which is fine with her. One of her friends suggests that Rebecca try a very discreet escort service run by her own cousin (Morgan Fairchild). It is then that Rebecca meets Paris and through a series of very discreet meetings, Rebecca eventually warms up to Paris' gentle advances and achieves her goals of having sex with another woman, and experiencing true happiness and satisfaction. We learn that Paris, who is well appreciated for her services, seems to be in agony over a past mistake that had led her to this profession. It is implied that Paris' husband died after she accidentally pushed him into the road and he was hit by a car shortly after their wedding day. It is Rebecca who later helps Paris to let go of her past and heal. Meanwhile, one of the three Westridge children finds the medical report of inoperable cancer that Mason Westridge has been hiding in his office desk. They all confront Rebecca and ask whether she had known about it all along. The children assume that the report refers to their father, and Rebecca tells her children that and they are not to mention it. Rebecca contacts another escort, Paris' friend, and gives her an envelope of money to help Paris leave the escort world and pursue her artistic talents. She reveals that she is the one who has cancer, and that she is dying. Afterwards, Rebecca makes the courageous decision to say goodbye to Paris. Towards the end of the movie, Rebecca is seen as a butterfly,and beautiful girl and such a kind human someone who has learned to spread her wings because of her relationship with Paris. In the final scene, Paris has her own art exhibition after Rebecca's funeral. Jessica approaches Paris and introduces herself, as the two lesbian best friends watch, and says, \\"I want to learn about my mother at the end.\\" Cast * Barbara Niven as Rebecca * Jessica Clark as Paris * Cathy DeBuono as Dawn * John Heard as Mason Westridge * Morgan Fairchild as Valentina *Kerry Knuppe as Jessica Westridge *Imelda Corcoran as Kelly *Mary Jane Wells as Shirin *Rebecca Staab as Sylvie *Erika Schiff as Ella Reception Rated 5.8 out of 10 stars by IMDb.

The town is situated on the confluence of Manson Creek and Slate Creek, north of Manson Lakes. The community is quite isolated being 180km north of Fort St. James or west of Mackenzie via all weather logging roads. During the Omenica Gold Rush, Robert Howell discovered coarse placer gold in Manson Creek on July 5 1871. The communities Manson Creek, Howellton and Dunkeld were established soon after. Howelltown, built on Discovery Bar was at first the largest and became the capital of the Omineca. Dunkeld built on upper Lost Creek was the site of a small theatre. Manson Creek, at the bottom of Kildare Gulch had for a time three saloons and became the government centre with the Post Office and Gold Commissioners offices. Of all the old communities established in the Omenica Goldfields only Manson Creek remains today. The old Gold Commissioners Office/Post Office building vintage 1871 still stands at its original site. Manson Creek has changed much over the years. During the 1930s an even greater Gold Rush revived the community as it shifted closer to the new Hudson's Bay Trading Post established in 1936. In the 1980s Manson Creek again experienced a surge of placer and lode gold prospectors when gold prices soared record highs. Forty to fifty crown residential lots were surveyed and sold quickly. In 1981 an elementary school was built and remained for only two year when it was closed due to government cutbacks. The late 1980s were hard on the community of Manson Creek. A drop in business and family squabbles led to the bankruptcy of the store. A few years later the property was donated to the newly formed Manson Creek Historic Society.

Despite the title, it is not considered to be connected to the 2002 film Blue Crush. Film reviews were generally negative. Plot After looking through her dead mother's diary filled with pictures of her time surfing in South Africa, Dana (Sasha Jackson) decides to leave California to travel there, surfing everywhere her mother did as well as Jeffreys Bay, where her mother always wanted to surf but never did. Dana leaves while her father (Gideon Emery) is away on a business trip taking a wooden carving with her. On her plane ride there, she meets Grant (Chris Fisher) and he tells her to look him up if she is in his area. After landing, Dana gets on a bus headed for the beach and is followed by a man that tries to take her backpack. When he tries to sit next to her, she calls to a girl around her age that just boarded the bus saying she saved her a seat. Pushy A.K.A. Dan Wigmore (Elizabeth Mathis) introduces herself and they go surfing together after Dana puts her backpack in a locker. On the water they meet Tara (Sharni Vinson), a stuck-up Roxy surfer. After some confrontation, Pushy leaves and Dana beats Tara for a wave. On the next wave Tara cuts in on Dana, causing her to break her board that was her mother's and cannot be replaced. Once back on the beach, Dana finds that her locker was broken into and her money and wooden carving (belonging to her mother) were stolen. Pushy takes a depressed Dana back to her place, a group of huts on the beach where she and other surfers live. Tara also lives there and continues to be mean to Dana. At the same time, policemen arrive and give the surfers one week to vacate the premises. Dana meets Tim (Ben Milliken) and he instantly takes a liking to her. After a nap there is a party that night and while Tim is trying to talk to Dana she spots Grant from the plane and dances with and kisses him. The next day she tells them about her mom and how she wants to take pictures of herself at all the same places her mom did. Tara bets her a hundred dollars that she won't be able to do it and Pushy agrees to travel with Dana on her \\"odyssey\\". Grant lets them borrow his truck in exchange for working at his restaurant. As they are about to leave, Tim gives Dana a Polaroid camera so that the pictures will be the same and her board that he repaired. After each surfing destination they return to the beach house and soon there is only Jeffreys Bay (J-Bay) left where Dana will fulfill her mother's dream and Pushy will try out for the Roxy team. While waiting for the right weather to leave for J-Bay, Dana works and one day she thinks she sees the man that stole her possessions. He is talking to Grant but Grant says he doesn't know the man. That night Dana and Pushy travel to the part of town Pushy is from to go dancing. While there Dana is confronted by the man who stole her possessions and she and Pushy follow him and find Grant's truck filled with elephant tusks. The men chase them and they barely get away. Pushy then gets mad at Dana and says she is dangerous and on her own for J-Bay. After their fight, Dana rips down all the odyssey pictures from the wall. The next morning the police come back, this time with bulldozers, to tear down the illegal beach hut where they live. After getting out, Dana and Pushy reconcile. Tim gets his bus working and they decide that everyone will drive to J-Bay. On the bus Tim has the odyssey pictures that he saved from the demolition and he and Dana grow closer. One night while everyone is gathered around a fire Dana and Tim go off and he sings her a song he wrote her and they fall in love. Meanwhile, Dana's father finds her gone and comes to South Africa looking for her. He ends up at the torn-down beach hut and is told they went to J-Bay so he flies there to find her. Dana's father then finds her and they get in a fight. While Tim and Pushy are consoling her they run into a beach party that Grant and Tara are at. Tim confronts Grant about the elephant tusks (Tim works with the elephants) and they get into a fist fight that Tim wins. The next day Pushy tries out for the Roxy surf team and wins using that 360 aerial move that Dana has been teaching her. Tara puts aside their differences and congratulates her. Tara also returns the wooden carving to Dana that she found among Grant's things. That night Dana's father comes back and after making up she shows him the pictures of her odyssey and gives him the wooden carving. They then go to the beach and drop her mother's ashes out the carving (an urn). The next day Dana goes to surf J-Bay that has very big waves and is a boy's club. Once out there Grant gets the guys to let her stay and after getting crushed on her first wave and has a great ride with Tim, Pushy, and her dad watching her. They then take a picture together and her dad says that he is proud of her and that her mother would be, too. The film ends with Dana and everybody back on the bus and heading on their next location.

Born on 23 March 1902 into a modest family in Malnia, Poland, Joseph Cebula was the eldest of three children. He suffered tuberculosis as a youth and was declared incurable at first; but after his recovery, he went to an Oblate shrine and shared his story with Father Jan Pawolik. Pawolik suggested he study at the minor seminary at Krotoszyn. Cebula completed his secondary studies there. In 1921 he began his novitiate at Markowice. He studied philosophy in Liege, Belgium, and finished his theological studies at Lubliniec.\\"Blessed J√≥zef Cebula, OMI\\", OMI China He was ordained as a priest on 5 June 1927 while still in a seminary.

In October 1939 the 100 member community at Markowice was placed under house arrest, and set to work as farm laborers. On 4 May 1940, the Oblate novices at Markowice were sent to the concentration camp at Dachau in Upper Bavaria, Germany. However, Father Cebula continued to minister as a priest in secret despite the ban on it. After being denounced for administering the sacraments to the sick he was arrested by the SS on April 2, 1941 and sent to the camp at Inowroclaw. On April 7, he was taken to a concentration camp at Mauthausen in Austria and was harassed and forced to hard labor. On 9 May, Father Cebula suddenly summoned up his strength and said, \\"It is not you who are in charge. God will judge you.\\" The Nazis ordered him to run with a rock on his back, towards the camp's barbed wire fence, where a guard shot him to death with a submachine gun and declared that Father Cebula \\"was shot while trying to escape\\". His body was taken to a crematorium and burned to ashes. He was beatified by Pope John Paul II on 13 June 1999 as one of the 108 Martyrs of World War II.

The story details Walker's experience with foreclosure on her Los Angeles home. Overview Walker describes her and husband's day-to-day life from their first foreclosure notice to the day they move out, including interactions with lenders, phone calls to elected officials and awkward looks across the office. She also recounts the pressures on her marriage and her own stress-induced illness, along with generous support from family and friends. A positive attitude is Walker's guiding principle and the core of her advice of for others facing financial hardship. Even after losing everything, she still believes she's better off because of it. \\"The biggest triumph for me,\\" Walker writes, \\"is really getting that we don't need money and stuff to make us happy. We just need each other and a good dose of perspective.\\" The book is adapted from Walker's blogLove in the Time of Foreclosure blog of the same title, with additional stories, details and insight. It is published as an ebook by Outpost19Outpost19.com and is available at major online booksellers. Critical response Recessionwire co-founder Sara Clemence describes the book this way: \\"Stephanie Walker writes about tough experiences with honesty, humor and a good dose of optimism. Her story is a window on a downturn that's affected millions of Americans - for worse, but also sometimes for better. There are life lessons in here for all of us.\\" Dick Gordon, host of American Public Media's The Story, offers this response: \\"Stephanie Walker has the wit to transform the shame and anxiety of foreclosure into a genuine human adventure. It's a rare storyteller who can endure the soul-shaking loss of a home, and the concurrent stress on relationships, and see through that - one's higher priorities in life. Stephanie does this with the kind of humor and personal insight that challenges the fierce attachment that we have to bricks and boards, and she leads us to a new understanding of what's really important as 'home.'\\" Author background Walkers currently lives in Chicago with her husband and their son.

It is a historic country house and is grade 2 listed as an important example of Victorian architecture. History 1659 map of Hertfordshire showing the enclosed estate of Penley A village of Pendley (or Penley, Pendele, or Pentlai) is recorded from the 4th century AD, held in the honour of Berkhampstead. The manor of Pendley pre-dates the Norman Conquest of 1066, after which it was confiscated by William the Conqueror and passed to his brother-in-law, Robert, Count of Mortain, who became one of the greatest landholders in the newly conquered Kingdom of England. A later owner was John de Angle, an early Member of Parliament. =The Whittinghams and the Verneys= By the 15th century, Pendley was a small town. In 1440 the county sheriff of Essex and Hertfordshire Sir Robert Whittingham (or Whytingham) and his wife Agnes received a grant of free warren from King Henry VI at Pendley manor; Sir Robert enclosed 200 acres and tore down the buildings on the land, returning the estate to pasture. He built a manor house at the western end of the now-demolished town as a double cloistered courtyard similar to those found at Herstmonceux Castle and Eton College. Whittingham subsequently obtained a papal licence to build a chapel at the manor house and engage a priest to hold services there when the roads became impassable in winter.WHITTINGHAM, Robert (d.1452), of London and Pendley, Herts. at the History of Parliament. Accessed November 2013 On the accession of King Edward IV, Whittingham's fortunes changed; the king attainded Whittingham for his loyalty to Henry and in 1461 he granted Pendley manor to George Neville, Bishop of Exeter. Around 1472, Whittingham's daughter Margaret married John Verney, son of a Lord Mayor of London Sir Ralph de Verney. Because of the king's favour for Verney, he lifted the attainder on Whittingham and Pendley Manor land passed to the Verney family. =The Andersons and the Harcourts= The Anderson tomb in the Pendley Chapel, St. John the Baptist, Aldbury The Verney family lived at the medieval manor for the next 150 years. The Anderson family then occupied it for four generations from 1606-7. In 1630, a friend of Sir Richard Anderson, the Rev. Lawrence Washington, visited Pendley Manor. During his stay there he became acquainted with Amphyllis Twigden and began an love affair with her. As a fellow of Brasenose College, Oxford, Washington was prohibited from marrying, and in 1631 Amphyllis bore him a son out of wedlock. Eventually Archbishop William Laud granted the couple a licence to marry, and Lawrence and Amphyllis were married in Tring in late 1632. Their son, John Washington, emigrated to Virginia in 1657. The Washington family became established in the new colony, and over a century later in 1789, John's great- grandson, George Washington, became the first President of the United States of America. In 1677, Anderson's daughter Elizabeth married the politician Simon Harcourt. Sir Richard Anderson died in 1699, and he was buried in the Pendley Chapel in the Church of St John the Baptist in the neighbouring village of Aldbury, alongside his wife Dame Elizabeth Anderson and their other children. As the young Elizabeth was the Anderson family's only surviving child, Pendley Manor passed through marriage to the Harcourt family. In the 1830s, at the height of the Industrial Revolution, railway engineer Robert Stephenson began construction on the new London and Birmingham Railway. The project was delayed by opposition from local landowners (among them Lord Brownlow and Sir Astley Cooper); after a change in the planned route, parliamentary approval was granted, and the railway line was built along a route parallel to the Grand Junction Canal, some distance to the east of Tring ‚Äî but too close to Pendley Manor to suit the occupant, Sir William Harcourt. He regarded the incursion of the iron horse into the locality as an intolerable nuisance and abandoned Pendley Manor. The ancient medieval manor buildings burnt down soon after in 1835.Pendley Manor - A short history. Available at the hotel reception. November 2011 =The new manor= A Local landowner and mill owner, Joseph Grout Williams commissioned architect Walter F K Ryan to build a new Tudor style Manor, the present building, in 1872.

The last private owner was BBC show jumping commentator Dorian Williams, who developed it as a center for adult education and the arts after the second World War. He inaugurated the Pendley Open Air Shakespeare Festival in 1949 in the hotel grounds which continues to run to the present day. The grounds have two landscaped open-air theatres. The indoor Court Theatre has permanently occupied the former stables to the estate since 1978 and presents a full programme of drama and musical performance.http://www.courttheatre.co.uk/index.html The Court Theatre The house was sold to a property company in 1983 and then in 1989 to a hotel company which invested in the building and re-opened it as a country house hotel in 1991. There have since been several extensions built to house additional rooms, a spa and gymnasium and a banqueting / conference suite. Architecture The present building was erected c.1874 near the site of the old manor house. It was designed in a neo-Jacobean style by the architect Walter F K Ryan and it built in red brick with Bath stone dressings. Architectural features include a half-timbered jettied top floor; tall decorated brick chimney pots; a square tower with an ogee-shaped lead roof; ornamental herringbone brickwork, carved Jacobean-style Ionic pilasters and stucco panels. The date 1875 is carved in stone above the porch.

The episode originally aired with the succeeding episode \\"Internal Affairs\\" on Fox in the United States on May 20, 2012. In the episode, Brian and Stewie respond to viewer mail. Three segments respectively feature a British version of Family Guy, Peter Griffin turning everybody he touches into Robin Williams, and a typical day from Stewie's point of view. The episode is a sequel to the first viewer mail episode in the show's third season. The episode was written by Tom Devanney, Alec Sulkin and Deepak Sethi and directed by Greg Colton. It received mixed reviews for its storyline and cultural references, the more positive reviews going to the \\"Chap of the Manor\\" and \\"Point of Stew\\" segments, and the more negative reviews going to the \\"Fatman and Robin\\" segment. This episode features guest performances from Cate Blanchett, Max Burkholder, John Finnemore, Colin Ford, Ioan Gruffudd, Tom Hollander, Rachael MacFarlane, Chris O'Dowd, Jeff Ross, and Joshua Rush, along with several recurring guest performers for the series. The episode was dedicated to musician Warren Luening. Plot Just like the first viewer mail episode, Brian and Stewie read their mail from viewers and tell three stories. =\\"Chap of the Manor\\"= The episode uses the premise that Family Guy is based on a British television show. The characters from Family Guy are all presented as stereotypical English people, apart from Stewie, who is a devoutly religious redneck with a hillbilly accent, as he already has an English accent in the main show. Brian is also an effeminate horse. In this British version of the series, Neville (Peter) states that he is going to the pub to meet his friends. When the news announces that Queen Elizabeth II will be in the parade, Neville tells his friends that he is related to the Queen (due to him misinterpreting his nana say she was in a bad marriage with a \\"bloody\\" duke, when it was just blood in her stool) and wishes to gain a lock of the Queen's hair to test it. When the Queen passes by, he tries to set up a fake barber chair along the route. When this fails to gain the Queen's attention twice, Neville and Collingsworth (Chris) steal a police motorcycle and chase the Queen to her death in a tunnel. As Neville and Collingsworth try to nonchalantly walk away, they are chased by a cohort of London Bobbies to the tune of \\"Yakety Sax\\". Back home, Neville discovers they are not related to the Queen after all. =\\"Fatman and Robin\\"= While Peter is watching a roast of his favorite stand-up comedian Robin Williams on Comedy Central, he feels offended when insult comic Jeff Ross insults Williams. Peter runs outside in the middle of a thunderstorm and accuses God of hating Williams, wishing that everyone were Williams before getting struck by lightning. Upon waking up in the hospital, he discovers he has gained the ability to turn everyone and everything he touches into Williams (similar to the Midas Touch). Peter turns everyone in the city into Robin Williams (while \\"Rockin' Robin\\" is played). At first, this goes well for Peter, but soon the multiple clones become too much for him, especially after he accidentally turns Lois into one. After numerous suicide attempts which fail because everything he touches turns into Williams, he orders the drove of clones to venture into the world to make others laugh, but chooses five clones to serve as replacements to his family members. The story ends showing that Peter appears insane and has cut both his hands off, a solution that prevents him from bringing any new clones into the world. Stewie was the only one that was not transformed, as he mimicked Williams, and at the end of the scene he is shown on the roof suggesting that Disney did not let the show portray Williams' role as the Genie from Aladdin. =\\"Point of Stew\\"= The audience sees the world through Stewie's eyes as Lois changes him, Meg wishes him to keep her ring (Stewie stating this is a \\"Red Flag\\"), and his friends ask him to go down the slide at the playground (doing a reference to the film National Lampoon's Vacation in the process). Later, Stewie secures a Twinkie to stuff in Brian's tail pipe on his car but ends up going for an unexpected ride with Brian where he chases a squirrel in his car and kills it. He then spots Herbert underneath a school bus. At bath time, he imagines a doll being eaten by a shark and Peter joins him. At bedtime, he makes a quick trip through time to stop Kurt Cobain from killing himself in 1994 by introducing him to H√§agen- Dazs ice cream; on returning to the present he sees an obese Cobain on a 2012 album. As Lois reads a bedtime story about the town from Footloose, a drunken Peter rudely interrupts for sex as Stewie is forced to listen. In his dreams, he visualizes Peter and Lois, who are having sex in reality, as lumberjacks chopping down trees with axes, with Peter, cutting down his tree signifying the end of the sex, and Lois beginning to cut down hers with a chainsaw, representing her beginning to use a vibrator, to finish. Reception The episode received a 2.6 rating and was watched by a total of 5.35 million people; this made it the most watched show on Animation Domination that night, beating The Cleveland Show, Bob's Burgers, and The Simpsons with 4.97 million. Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B with each segment getting an A-, C, and B-, respectively, saying \\"\\"Viewer Mail\\" is composed of three shorter stories, an opportunity to completely alter the structure of the show and tell a different kind of story. As far as the repetitive nature of Family Guy goes, at least this technique has a reasonable track record of success, so it's not all that surprising that the first segment in this anthology is one of the best moments for the show all year.\\" Robin Williams incident Peter attempts suicide but his revolver becomes Robin Williams. This caused controversy when the episode was shown on BBC Three in the United Kingdom shortly before it was announced that Williams had died by suspected suicide. BBC Three showed a repeat of this episode in the United Kingdom on August 11, 2014, the day that Robin Williams committed suicide. The episode aired at 23:25 BST, and news of Williams' death broke about 23:50 BST. Viewers reacted to the coincidence, highlighting that Peter attempted suicide in the episode.

He won the Derby at Epsom as a three-year-old in 1969 and was one of the few winners of the race to campaign successfully at four. He later had a successful stud career. Background Blakeney was bred by his owner and trainer Arthur Budgett at Kirtlington, Oxfordshire. He was the first of two Derby winners produced by the Oaks runner-up Windmill Girl, the other being Morston who won the race in 1973. His sire, Hethersett, was a top class racehorse who won the St Leger in 1962. Hethersett and Blakeney are representatives of the Byerley Turk sire line, unlike more than 95% of modern thoroughbreds, who descend directly from the Darley Arabian. Blakeney, who was named after a village in Norfolk, was sent to the Newmarket Sales as a yearling. Shortly before the sale the colt was kicked by another horse and the resulting swelling deterred potential buyers so that he failed to reach his reserve price of 5,000gns. Budgett therefore decided to train the colt himself at his Whatcombe Stables near Wantage. The colt's one eccentricity was that he refused to enter a horse box in the usual way, preferring to go in backwards. Racing career =1968: two-year-old season= Blakeney did not appear on the racecourse until the autumn of his first season. In September he finished fourth in the Clarence House Stakes at Ascot behind the future Coronation Cup winner Caliban. A month later, Blakeney, ridden by Ernie Johnson, recorded his first victory by winning the twenty-seven runner race at Newmarket. During the winter, Budgett claimed that he turned down a \\"big American offer\\" for the colt and backed him for the Derby at odds of 100/1. =1969: three-year-old season= Blakeney took time to reach his peak in the spring of 1969, and did not appear until two weeks before the Derby, when he ran in the Lingfield Derby Trial. Ridden by Geoff Lewis, he had problems finding a clear run, but then finished strongly to finish second to The Elk. The performance convinced some observers that the colt had been a \\"desperately unlucky\\" loser and was a serious contender for the Derby. At Epsom, Blakeney was reunited with the twenty-one-year-old Ernie Johnson, who had been promised the ride after the win at Newmarket, and started at odds of 15/2. He was held up in the early stages as the pace was set by Moon Mountain. In the straight, Johnson made his challenge on the inside and drove Blakeney through a gap along the rails to take the lead inside the final furlong. The colt ran on strongly to win by a length from Shoemaker, with Prince Regent third. After the race, Budgett described himself as \\"the luckiest man in the world.\\" In his three remaining starts in 1969, Blakeney failed to reproduce his Derby-winning form. In the Irish Derby at the end of June he finished fourth of the fifteen runners behind Prince Regent. Blakeney did not have a particularly clear run in the St Leger in September, but his fifth place behind Intermezzo was a disappointment. On his final start he ran unplaced behind Levmoss in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. =1970: four-year-old season= Blakeney started his four-year-old season disappointingly, finishing fifth in the Jockey Club Stakes at Newmarket in April. In May he recorded his first win since the Derby when taking the Ormonde Stakes at Chester. Budgett then took the unusual decision to move Blakeney up in distance for the two and a half mile Ascot Gold Cup, a race which had not been won by a Derby winner since Ocean Swell in 1945. He appeared to cope with the extreme distance, but finished second, beaten three quarters of a length by Precipice Wood. Blakeney‚Äôs best performance of the year came in defeat, when he ran in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot in July. Although he was no threat to the odds on favourite Nijinsky he kept on well under pressure to finish second, four lengths clear of the other runners who included Caliban (Coronation Cup), Crepellana (Prix de Diane) and the Washington, D.C. International winner Karabas. On his final start he improved on his 1969 effort in the Prix de l‚ÄôArc de Triomphe, finishing fifth of the twenty-four runners behind Sassafras. Assessment Timeform rated Blakeney at 123 as a three-year-old (their lowest rating for a Derby winner) and 126 as a four-year-old. In their book A Century of Champions, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Blakeney a ‚Äúpoor‚Äù Derby winner.Randall, J and Morris, T. Portway Press, 1999, p. 205 Randall, writing in the Racing Post, rated Blakeney the third worst Derby winner since 1945. Arthur Budgett called him \\"a bloody good horse.\\" Stud career Blakeney stood as a stallion at the National Stud at Newmarket, where was later joined by his fellow Derby winners Mill Reef and Grundy. He made a successful start to his stud career, getting the Oaks winner Juliette Marny in his first crop of foals. His other notable winners included Julio Mariner, Tyrnavos, Mountain Lodge and Roseate Tern. Through his daughter Percy‚Äôs Lass, he is the broodmare sire of the Derby winner Sir Percy. Blakeney died in 1992 and is buried at the National Stud.

His published books include: Principles of semiconductor device operation (1960) Dielectric relaxation in solids (1983), Universal relaxation law: a sequel to Dielectric relaxation in solids (1996), Universal relaxation law (1995), Problems in physical electronics (1973), Physics of thin films. vol. 8 (1975), and Physics of thin films. vol. 11 (1980). Jonscher pioneered the study of emergent phenomena in natural systems, and dielectric behaviour in particular. The Universal dielectric response whereby power law scaling of conductivity with frequency is found in heterogeneous materials under alternating current conditions has drawn significant attention due to its significance in many technological applications. Although this scaling behaviour is observed across a tremendously wide range of systems, there is yet no consensus regarding the origins of such emergent dielectric responses. To date (the end of 2018 year), about 9500 references had been made on two works of A. K. Jonscher (Dielectric relaxation in solids, 1999; The \\"universal\\" dielectric response, 1977).

The Uddenitinae, proposed by Miller and Furnish, and known from the Pennsylvanian (U Carb) and Lower Permian, are transitional between the ancestral Pronoritidae and the more traditional medlicottiids Morphology Genera of the Uddenitinae have narrow discoidal shells with narrow flat or sometimes grooved venters. Sutures are goniatitic to ceratitic with rounded saddles and slightly pointed to digitate lobes which form a declining series going toward the umbilicus. The ventral lobe is commonly long and narrow, and trifucated with sharp, simple prongs. Genera The Uddenitinae includes Prouddenites, (ancestral form), Uddenites,(type genus), Daixites, Neouddenites, and Uddenoceras. Prouddenites, named by Miller, 1930, which is found in the Pennsylvanian of the south-central United States and the Urals, has a discoidal shell with a flattened venter and a suture with an unequally trifid first lateral lobe. It is intermediate between Pronorites and Uddenites. Uddenites, named by B√∂se, 1919, known from the Upper Pennsylvanian of Texas and the Urals, has a discoidal shell with a retuse (grooved) venter. The ventral portion of the first lateral lobe is intermediate in depth. Diaxites, Ruzhentsev 1941, has the characteristic discoidal form but the ventral lobe is quite wide, still trifid. Diaxites is Upper Pennsylvanian and Lower Permian in age. Neouddenites, Ruzhentsev 1961, is similar to Uddenites, but later, coming from the Lower Permian. Uddenoceras, named by Miller and Furnish, 1954, from the Upper Pennsylvanian of Texas and the Urals has a discoidal shell like Uddenites, but the ventro- lateral portion of the suture forms a broad saddle. Generic phylogeny Prouddenties has its origin in the (Pronoritidae), probably in Uralopronorites from the Upper Mississippian, and giving rise to Uddenites and Daixites. Uddenites in turn gave rise to Uddenoceras and Neouddenties. Daixites left no known descendants. References * Miller, Furnish, and Schindewolf, 1957.

He played an important role in the anti- malaria campaign in the South West Pacific Area during the Second World War, and in preventative medicine in Australia after the war, but is best known for his Bibliography of Australian Medicine. After the war, Ford wrote a thesis on malaria control in the South West Pacific, for which he was awarded his Doctor of Medicine (MD) degree by the University of Melbourne in 1946. He became Director of the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine at the University of Sydney in 1946, and Professor of Preventive Medicine in 1947, concurrently holding these two positions until his 1968 retirement. Education and early life Edward (Ted) Ford was born in Bethanga, Victoria, on 15 April 1902, the son of Edward John Knight Ford and his wife Mary Doxford, n√©e Armstrong. His first job after leaving Clunes Higher Elementary School was as a telegraph boy at the Postmaster-General's Department (PMG), which he joined in April 1917, later working in its accounts branch. After he matriculated at the age of 24 he enrolled in an arts course at the University of Melbourne, but soon switched to medicine. He supported himself by continuing to work for the PMG by night. He graduated with his Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) degrees in 1932, and did his residency at Melbourne Hospital. Ford became a lecturer in anatomy at the university in 1933, and became a senior lecturer in anatomy and histology in 1934. While there he met Frederic Wood Jones, who shared and encouraged a passion for books. Ford would later dedicate his Bibliography of Australian Medicine 1790‚Äì1900 to Jones. Ford became interested in physical anthropology, and later tropical medicine. He moved to Sydney, where he became a lecturer at the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine at the University of Sydney, from which he obtained a Graduate Diploma in Tropical Medicine in 1938. That year, he travelled to Papua where he conducted a study of sexually transmitted disease among the people of the Trobriand Islands, Goodenough Island and the D'Entrecasteaux Islands for the Papuan administration. When he returned to Australia in 1939, he became the Medical Officer in Charge of the Commonwealth Laboratory in Darwin. Military career In June 1940, in the early months of the Second World War, Ford volunteered for service with the Second Australian Imperial Force and was commissioned as a major in the Australian Army Medical Corps, receiving the service number NX445. In March 1941 he was sent to the Middle East as commanding officer of the 1st Australian Mobile Bacteriological Laboratory, and was soon engaged in the diagnosis of a variety of hitherto uncertain diseases. In July 1941, Ford's unit moved to Syria, where it was attached to the 2/3rd Casualty Clearing Station, providing the latter with the diagnostic capabilities of a larger general hospital, of which none were available. Ford returned to Australia in March 1942, and was promoted to lieutenant colonel in August. He was appointed Assistant Director of Pathology, I Corps and New Guinea Force. To combat the danger of dysentery, Ford had all available supplies of sulphaguanidine in Australia shipped up to New Guinea, where Australian forces were fighting a desperate campaign against the Japanese. This was a new drug that Neil Hamilton Fairley had tested in the Middle East, and found to be effective. An initial dose of 4g followed by 2g doses at four hourly intervals was found to rapidly relieve the symptoms and permit the sufferers to travel. New Guinea had numerous tropical diseases that posed a threat to the health and fitness of the troops fighting there, but the biggest medical problem was malaria. In December Ford took his case to the Commander in Chief (and commander of New Guinea Force), General Sir Thomas Blamey. After being lectured by Ford for about an hour on the history and dangers of malaria, and what needed to be done, Blamey said: \\"I think I understand you, Colonel Ford. If I don't do these things, my troops will suffer.\\" \\"What I have been trying to tell you, Sir,\\" Ford replied, \\"is that if you don't do these things, you won't have any bloody troops to suffer.\\" Blamey liked officers who spoke to him like that. The effect was soon felt: Blamey even wrote an article on malaria in New Guinea Force's newspaper, Guinea Gold, in which he exhorted his men to take proper precautions against malaria. \\"Our worst enemy in New Guinea is not the Nip,\\" he wrote, \\"it's the bite.\\" Gradually, the incidence of the once epidemic disease began to drop. For his part, Ford was mentioned in despatches for \\"gallant and distinguished services\\". In March 1943, Ford was appointed malariologist at Allied Land Forces Headquarters (LHQ) in Melbourne. Here he was charged with responsibility for co-ordinating the Army's overall effort against malaria. In March 1945, he became Director of Hygiene, Pathology and Entomology at LHQ, and in May he was promoted to colonel. For his services he was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (Military Division) on 19 July 1945 for his \\"skill, energy and initiative of a high order\\". He was transferred to the Reserve of Officers on 25 June 1946. After the war he served in the part-time Citizen Military Forces, and was Director of Army Health from 1953 to 1964. Academia After the war, Ford wrote a thesis on malaria control in the South West Pacific, for which he was awarded his Doctor of Medicine (MD) degree by the University of Melbourne in 1946. He received a Rockefeller Fellowship that allowed him to study at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, where he gained a Diploma of Public Health with distinction in 1947. Ford became Director of the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine at the University of Sydney in 1946, and Professor of Preventive Medicine in 1947, concurrently holding these two positions until his 1968 retirement. In addition, he was the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine and a Fellow of the Senate from 1953 to 1957, and was Acting Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sydney from November 1960 until March 1961. He was involved in the establishment of the medical school at the University of Western Australia, and was a member of the council of Macquarie University. His wartime Army service was recognised in 1946 by his appointment as a fellow of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians (RACP) in 1946. He later served as its Vice-President from 1970 to 1972. He became a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) in London in 1958, and also of the Royal Australian College of Medical Administrators, the Zoological Society, London, and the Royal Sanitary Institute, London. He was made an honorary fellow of the Royal College of Pathologists of Australia in 1971, and of the Royal Australian Historical Society in 1957. On 1 January 1960, he was created a knight bachelor. In 1969 the RCP and the RACP awarded him the Neil Hamilton Fairley medal, and he was granted an honorary Doctor of Letters by the University of Sydney in 1971. Ford collected books, and he was a curator of the RACP library from 1958 until his death in 1986. He donated some 2,200 items to the library. Today other books from his collection can be found in the libraries of La Trobe University, Macquarie University and the University of Sydney, where the Burkitt-Ford library is named in his honour. In 1976, he published his Bibliography of Australian Medicine 1790‚Äì1900. Benedetto (\\"Ben\\") Haneman predicted that this work would be \\"one reason Ford's name will be permanently recalled in any study of the historiography of Australian medicine.\\" Ford, who never married, died at his home in Potts Point, New South Wales, on 27 August 1986 and was cremated. Some of his papers are in the Mitchell Library in Sydney, while others can be found in the National Archives of Australia in Sydney.

It has assets in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Zambia and elsewhere. A recent takeover bid by the Jinchuan Group of China valued the company at US$1.1 billion. History The company was founded in 1975 by a consortium that included Anthony Simon Malone, and acquired Rand London Mines. In the following years Metorex acquired additional properties mining a variety of minerals including gold, coal, asbestos, copper, zinc and tin. The mines were located in South Africa, Namibia and Zambia. In December 1999 Metorex merged with Consolidated Murchison and listed on the JSE and LSE exchanges. In the following years the company continued to expand through acquisition of new properties. In 2004 Metorex entered into a joint venture to develop the Ruashi copper mine site in the DRC, and subsequently made substantial investments in this project. In April 2011 Vale announced that it intended to offer to purchase Metorex at a price of R7,524 million. This was topped by an offer by Jinchuan Group in July 2011 that valued the company at R9,112 million. Jinchuan said it would treat Metorex as a strategic vehicle for expanding its mining presence in Africa. In October 2011 the South African and Zambian competition authorities approved the bid, now worth US$1.1 billion, and the main Zambian and DRC investors approved the deal. Assets Assets in the DRC include the existing Kinsenda Mine, the new Ruashi copper and cobalt mine, and the Dilala East and Lubembe deposit greenfields sites. In Zambia the company owns Chibuluma, a modern mechanised underground copper mine located near the town of Kalulushi that produces copper concentrate to be sold to smelters. Copper Resources Corporation is a subsidiary of Metorex. As of November 2011 it held a 92.5% interest in the Hinoba-an Porphyry Copper project in the Philippines, and a 75% interest in Miniere de Musoshi et Kinsenda (MMK). MMK, formerly a subsidiary of Forrest Group, owned the flooded Kinsenda and Musoshi copper mines in the Katanga Province. MMK became a subsidiary of Copper Resources Corporation as of 30 November 2005. Due to a Title Revisitation Process initiated by the DRC government, in February 2009 it was confirmed that the Musoshi mine would be returned to the state-owned Sodimico.

Today only a few earthworks remain. Very little is known about this castle. The name may be derived from the adjective ' = scrubby or rough.  Location  The site of the castle is on an isolated east-west limestone ridge, the Struvenberg, that descends towards the west into the basin where the village is situated, and is continued eastwards by the Ziegenberg. The castle is best reached from the western (village) side.  Layout  Whilst the steep 60¬∞ slope on the southern side of the ridge facing the Harz Mountains provided a good natural defence, the other sides were protected by straight ramparts with ditches in front of them. The ramparts, which are still recognisable today, clearly show the two adjacent rectangular wards of the castle. The eastern ward, with its deeper ditch to the west and its higher earthworks, is presumably the main, or upper, ward. The upper ward measures 70 √ó 100 metres, the lower ward 50 to 70 √ó 135 metres. Another outwork with a length of about 70 metres lies on the extreme western slope of the ridge. The Struvenburg was a hillfort typical of the Harz. There used to be a checkpoint (No. 83) on the Harzer Wandernadel hiking network located between the Struvenberg and Ziegenberg.  History  The castle may date to the Carolingian era, because its archaeological finds date to the 9th century. Because other finds are clearly of Saxon origin, it is possible that the 9th- century castle was built on the site of an even older hillfort. Little is known of the significance of the castle. From its strategic location ‚Äì the castle lay close to an important crossroads ‚Äì it may have had a military purpose in connexion with the overthrow of the local Saxon population by the Franks.

The Old Household  The Royal Household during the Habsburg dynasty was shaped after that one that existed in the Court of Burgundy. Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, but also King of Spain, imported the etiquette styled in the Court of his paternal grandmother Mary of Burgundy. To the ancient office of ‚ÄúMayordomo del Rey de Castilla‚Äù (Steward of the King of Castile), transformed in \\"Mayordomo mayor\\" (High Steward), the Emperor added that of the ‚ÄúSumiller de Corps‚Äù who was charged with everything regarding the organization of the inner rooms of the palace where the Monarch lived. Also, it was created the office of ‚ÄúCamarera mayor de Palacio‚Äù (First Lady of the Bedchamber). The latter two offices were not known in the traditional organization of the Court of the Kingdom of Castile.  The Royal Household during the 19th and 20th centuries  The Royal Household was substantially transformed during the reigns of King Ferdinand VII and Queen Isabella II but, over all, after the restoration of King Alfonso XII in 1875. Regarding the basic organization of this Royal Household, the structure was divided between the \\"Mayordomia\\" (Stewardship) and the \\"Camareria\\" (Ladyship). With organic independence, there existed the General Commander of the Royal Body of Halberdiers, the General Intendant of the Royal House and Heritage and the Royal Chaplain and Almoner. = The \\"Mayordom√≠a\\" = It was headed by the \\"Mayordomo mayor\\" (High Steward) to the King, also invested with the Office of \\"Sumiller de Corps\\", who was in charge of the protocol and organization of the ceremonies or activities presided or attended by the Monarch. Also, he was in charge of the high inspection of the royal buildings and the superior direction of the personnel at the service to the King. As holder of the privy seal, he was also responsible for the signature of official documents by the King and was the high chief of the Court honorary servants called ‚ÄúGentilhombres Grandes de Espa√±a con ejercicio y servidumbre‚Äù (Gentlemen of the bedchamber Grandees of Spain) and of those called ‚ÄúGentilhombres de camara con ejercicio‚Äù (Gentlemen of the bedchamber), both (but especially the first ones) with certain duties attached to the person of the King. Under the ‚ÄúMayordomo mayor‚Äù were also the ‚ÄúMayordomo mayor de la Reina‚Äù (High Steward to the Queen), the ‚ÄúMayordomos de semana‚Äù (Weekly stewards literally), the General Inspector of the Royal Palaces (Office created in 1852), the Private Secretary to the King, the Physicians and Pharmacists of the Bedchamber, and the Kings of Arms. = The \\"Camarer√≠a\\"= It was headed by the \\"Camarera mayor de Palacio\\" (First Lady of the Bedchamber) to the Queen who was in charge of the organization of ceremonies and activities presided or attended by the Queen and was the high chief of the \\"Damas de la Reina\\" (Ladies-in-waiting) and all the personnel attached to the service of the Queen. This office was suppressed in 1931 and never re-created after the restoration of the Monarchy in 1975. = Other offices = Also, it existed the \\"Caballerizo mayor\\" (Great Equerry) of the King who organized the travels of the King and who was in charge of the Royal Mews and the Royal hunting lodges, acting (in this latter case) as ‚ÄúMontero mayor‚Äù (Great Hunter). This office was suppressed in 1931 and never re-created after the restoration of the Monarchy in 1975. Organically independent from the ‚ÄúMayordom√≠a‚Äù and the ‚ÄúCamarer√≠a‚Äù there was the Office of General Commander of the Corps of Halberdiers, who was the Chief of the Military Household of the King. Under his command were the Chief Clerk, who was in charge of the keys of the Royal palaces, the Aides-de-camp to the King and the Military Assistants to the orders of the King, proceeding from diverse branches of the Army and Navy. Likewise under the General Commander were the so-called ‚ÄúMonteros de Espinosa‚Äù (Hunters of the Chamber), who were 12 gentlemen with proven nobility. They regularly kept guard outside the bedrooms of the King and the Queen during the night and accompanied them from the moment of their death up to the delivery of their remains to the Monastery of El Escorial. Equally independent, there existed the Office of the General Comptroller of the Royal House, who was the top financial chief and administrator of the Heritage of the Crown. Under his command were the Cashier, the General Archivist, the Royal Librarian, the Managers of the Royal Sites, the Bearers of the Royal Patronages and the Secretary of the Intendency. The third Office out of the ‚ÄúMayordom√≠a‚Äù was the ‚ÄúProcapell√°n‚Äù (Chaplain) and Great Almoner of the King who was the chief of the Royal Chapel, being the domestic prelate of the palace. Under the orders of the \\"Procapell√°n\\" were the Chaplains of Honor, the Ecclesiastic Secretary, and the so-called Chaplains of the Curtain, Chaplains of the Seal of Castile and those of the Seal of the various Military orders. During the reign of Alfonso XIII this Office was held by the Patriarch of the West Indies.  The end of the Royal Household in 1931 and the restoration of the Monarchy in 1975  This institution was suppressed after the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic in 1931. It is the historical precedent of the modern Royal Household of Spain. Nevertheless, when King Juan Carlos I acceded to the throne in 1975, he decided to create a Household completely different from the former court of his grandfather Alfonso XIII. The modern Royal Household is much simpler than the preceding institution and it was decided not to recreate the majority of Offices which had existed in the old Royal Household, maintaining basically the Head of the Royal Household and the General Secretary of the Royal Household, both Offices held by professional and prestigious civil servants.  The Heritage of the Crown  The Heritage of the Crown of Spain, managed by the General Intendant of the Royal House, was ruled by a Law of June 30, 1876, and successive decrees. The King resided at the Royal Palace of Madrid, where the official functions were exercised. Also forming part of the Heritage of the Crown were the Spanish royal sites, including the Royal Palace of Aranjuez, the Royal Palace of La Granja de San Ildefonso, the Royal Palace of El Escorial, the Royal Alc√°zar of Seville, the Royal Palace of El Pardo and the Royal Palace of La Almudaina. King Alfonso XIII built, as a personal property, the Palacio de la Magdalena. The Royal Patronages were the Royal Convent of the Salesas Reales, the Royal Convent of Las Descalzas Reales, the Royal Monastery of Saint Isabel, the Royal Convent of Santa Clara in Tordesillas, the Royal Abbey of Santa Mar√≠a la Real de Las Huelgas, the Royal Hospital of the Good Event of Madrid where it had his residence the ‚ÄúProcapell√°n‚Äù and the Royal Colleges of Alfonso XII and Maria Christina of Austria in El Escorial. All these Palaces and Patronages were transferred in 1940 to the Patrimonio Nacional which is now charged with their maintenance and is a public office depending from the Ministry of the Presidency of the Spanish Government.

It aired originally on November 3, 2011 on NBC. In the episode, Pierce decides to market Hawthorne Wipes to the gay community, only to be stopped by his homophobic father. This draws the ire of Jeff, who inadvertently exposes his own \\"daddy issues\\". Meanwhile, Troy is recruited by Greendale's secret air conditioning repair school. The episode was written by Matt Murray and directed by Joe Russo. It received mixed critical reviews. Plot Urbana Champaign \\"Pocket Full of Hawthornes\\" video excerpt. A video (\\"Pocket Full of Hawthornes\\") by drag queen Miss Urbana Champaign (Shangela Laquifa Wadley) devoted to Hawthorne Wipes has made the product popular among the gay community. Pierce decides to cash in on its popularity by launching a new line of wipes‚ÄîHawthorne's Pride Wipes‚Äîin \\"Greendale's First Annual Gay Bash\\". While plans for the party get underway, Pierce's dad, Cornelius (Larry Cedar), arrives and cancels the event. Cornelius displays deeply racist and homophobic attitudes and wears an ivory toup√©e. Jeff (Joel McHale), who grew up resenting his father's absence, is clearly affected by Pierce's submission to Cornelius and decides to help Pierce go ahead with the party. Britta (Gillian Jacobs) thinks Pierce and Jeff have Oedipal complex, although she constantly mispronounces it as \\"edible complex\\". Pierce is initially resistant to disobeying his father, but relents after receiving a warm welcome from the people at the party. Midway through the party, Cornelius shows up. Out of fear, Pierce declares Hawthorne Wipes a \\"straights-only\\" product, much to the disgust of the gay people at the event. While they jeer at him, Pierce collapses, faking a heart attack. At the hospital where Pierce is being treated, Jeff lays into Cornelius with an impassioned rant seemingly directed at his own absent father. Cornelius himself suffers a heart attack and dies. Meanwhile, Troy (Donald Glover) impresses Jerry (Jerry Minor), the school plumber, with his seemingly nonchalant talent for plumbing. Jerry warns Troy not to abuse his talent. While walking down the hallway alone, Troy is kidnapped by the secret Air Conditioning Repair School, led by Vice Dean of Air Conditioning, Robert Laybourne (John Goodman). At the school's initiation, Troy is the quickest at assembling an AC unit while blindfolded. This leads to an invitation to join the school by Laybourne, who promises Troy lucrative employment as an AC repairman for life. However, if Troy accepts, he must keep his occupation a secret. Jerry confronts Troy about being approached by the air conditioning school, but Troy rebuffs him. Troy consults Abed (Danny Pudi) about choosing between plumbing and air conditioning. Abed is indifferent, saying that both are similar, but tells Troy to go with what makes him the happiest. At the funeral of Cornelius (attended by all members of the group), Pierce tells Cornelius to \\"suck it\\" in his eulogy. Laybourne meets Troy at the funeral, asking for a decision. Troy declines Laybourne's invitation, saying his decision is to \\"watch TV with [his] friend.\\" Laybourne warns Troy that he is making a mistake and vows to keep pursuing him. At the funeral's end, Chang (Ken Jeong) picks up Miss Urbana Champaign and comically derides Jeff for going home alone. Production \\"Advanced Gay\\" was written by Matt Murray, his first writing credit for the series. It was directed by Joe Russo, his 18th directing credit. Cultural references The storyline involving Troy and his talents is a spoof of the 1997 film Good Will Hunting. His initiation ceremony as an air conditioning repairman drew references to Twin Peaks and The Big Lebowski. Troy and Abed's \\"Inspector Spacetime\\" act is a spoof of the television series Doctor Who. The name of the drag queen, Urbana Champaign, is also the name of a college town in Illinois. Reception =Ratings= In its original broadcast on November 3, 2011, \\"Advanced Gay\\" drew an estimated 3.84 million viewers, with a Nielsen rating/share of 1.7/5 in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. =Reviews= The episode received mixed reviews from critics. Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave it a 'B+', saying while \\"the episode didn‚Äôt quite earn all of its emotional moments, but I was impressed with how well it did regardless.\\" She added that the episode's ending was weak. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix praised Goodman's role but found Pierce's father's character too exaggerated. Hollywood.com's Kelsea Stahler said \\"'Advanced Gay' wasn‚Äôt terrible, it just feels like a bit of a letdown after the fantastic 'Remedial Chaos Theory' and the hilarious 'Horror Fiction in Seven Spooky Steps'.\\" Ethan Alter of Television Without Pity said the episode's A and B stories were \\"mashed together in a lumpy, misshapen way.\\" He also criticized the stereotypical portrayal of gay characters. Leigh Raines of TV Fanatic said, \\"By no means is Community opposed to tackling controversial issues and writing non-PC jokes, but this episode was sure to offend just about everyone. Still, I guess that was the point.\\" She rated the episode 3.5/5 stars.

It details their life together before returning to the present. The priest shoots and kills the mysterious blue fox he is hunting, but the sound from his rifle causes an avalanche. While trapped underneath the snow in a glacial cave, the priest starts to go insane. The fox comes back to life and argues with him about the invention of electricity and the priest kills the fox a second time, this time skinning her and wearing her fur. He then transforms into a blue fox himself. The book ends with a letter from the herbalist, who explains the girl with Down syndrome was the priest's daughter, whom he sold into slavery several years before the herbalist rescued her.

She was convicted of first-degree murder and was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole in September 2006. In March 2017, Schulhoff was given a reduced sentence of 40 years. Background Courtney Schulhoff lived in Altamonte Springs, Florida with her father after her parents divorced. She attended Lyman High School, but had dropped out and was pursuing her GED. Before dropping out of school, 15-year-old Schulhoff began dating Michael Morin, a man whom she had met at a dog race track across the street from her high school. Morin, who was five years Schulhoff's senior, was on probation for car theft after stealing his father's car. Schulhoff's father did not approve of their relationship but the couple continued to date. They would often hang out at a local gas station where Schulhoff reportedly told Morin that her father physically abused her regularly. Murder On the night of February 9, 2004, Schulhoff's father Stephen was beaten to death inside his apartment. After the murder, Schulhoff and Morin reportedly drove to a McDonald's 20 miles away in Orlando, Florida using Stephen Schulhoff's truck. Later in the afternoon, the couple returned to the apartment. Morin later said that he and Schulhoff had planned to take her father's body to Brevard County and throw it off a bridge. Schulhoff and Morin were apprehended on February 11 after Stephen Schulhoff's girlfriend, Elaine Bouck, came to the apartment to check on Stephen. Bouck called 911 after seeing the couple flee from the apartment. Schulhoff later told police that she and Morin had decided to kill her father after her father had beaten her on February 9. She initially claimed that while she was out taking her father's dog for a walk, Morin had decided to \\"take care of the problem\\" and kill Stephen. Schulhoff claimed that when she returned to the apartment, she discovered Morin covered in blood and saw the baseball bat by the front door. She stated that Morin admitted to killing her father and threatened to kill her if she called authorities. Morin denied that he had initiated the killing, stating that Schulhoff left the Louisville Slugger baseball bat used to kill Stephen Schulhoff outside the bedroom door for him to use. Morin claimed that he had tried to talk Schulhoff out of killing her father, to no avail. He also claimed to have no memory of beating Stephen Schulhoff stating that he \\"blacked out\\" as soon as he grabbed the bat and only became lucid when he was washing the blood off his body after the attack. In a second interview with police, Schulhoff admitted that she waited at the apartment's tennis court area while Morin killed her father and intentionally left the baseball bat by the door for Morin. Trials and convictions Courtney Schulhoff was the first of the defendants to stand trial. Her trial began on September 26, 2006. Prosecutors alleged that although Michael Morin had committed the murder, Schulhoff had orchestrated it. She did not testify in her own defense at the trial. The next day, she was found guilty of first-degree murder. Because she was only 16 when the murder was committed, she was ineligible for the death penalty; on September 27, 2006, she was sentenced to life without parole. After the judge handed down the obligatory sentence, Courtney Schulhoff spoke out in open court, stating: \\"Your Honor, I would like to openly admit in court that Michael Morin is not the person who killed my father. I was. So, I accept full responsibility, and I accept the verdict.\\" Michael Morin's murder trial began on April 16, 2007. Unlike his former girlfriend, he was facing a death sentence if convicted. During his testimony, he admitted killing Stephen Schulhoff but expressed regret for the action. At the trial, Schulhoff also testified in Morin's defense. She had given a new deposition after her conviction, and stated that she was the one who had bludgeoned Stephen Schulhoff to death with the baseball bat. However, on April 26, 2007, Michael Morin was convicted. He was sentenced to life in prison without parole, and is serving his sentence at the Taylor Correctional Institution. In 2009, Schulhoff was interviewed at the Lowell Correctional Institution in Ocala, Florida by RTL, a German news show, about the punishment of life without parole for juvenile offenders. In 2011, her case appeared on an episode of Snapped on the Oxygen Network. In 2015, Schulhoff was interviewed by former FBI criminal profiler Candice DeLong for the Investigation Discovery program Facing Evil. In 2017, Schulhoff was given a reduced sentence of 40 years.

When used by fishermen in the Philippines it is positioned on the sea bottom against a near-vertical underwater cliff wall (drop-off zone). Similar to a gillnet, the tangle net, or tooth net, is a type of nylon fishing net. Left in the water for no more than two days, and allowing bycatch to be released alive, this net is considered to be less harmful that other nets. The tangle net is used in the Philippines by commercial fishermen, as well as by the scientific community. When spent, these nets can be bundled, and left on the sea floor to collect smaller species. These bundles are known locally as lumen lumen nets. __TOC__ Description and technique The tangle net originated in British Columbia, Canada, as a gear specifically developed for selective fisheries.Petrunia, William Mark (1997). \\"Tooth Net Fishery. Report on Scientific License 96.149.\\" Jan. 5, 1997. Tangle nets have smaller mesh sizes than standard gillnets. They are designed to catch fish by their nose or jaw, enabling bycatch to be resuscitated and released unharmed.Tangle net fishing on the Columbia River. http://www.salmonforall.org/tanglenet/FAO Gillnets and entangling net. http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/219/en These nets are made with a very thin light nylon rope, have a small mesh and are strung between two ropes, a top rope with floats, and a bottom rope with weights. Dropped to the bottom of the ocean, located and retrieved through the use of a guide line and buoy, these nets have allowed both fishermen and scientists to reach areas not previously accessible. Tangle nets are generally left on the bottom for no more than a day or two so that the fish and bycatch does not die and spoil. Use in the Philippines For the last two decades tangle nets have been set in deep water near steep underwater cliffs off many islands in the Philippines by local fishermen in order to supplement their income through catching commercially valuable mollusks. Scientists have used this technique in recent years to explore the deep water marine habitat. The rich species diversity of the Philippine Islands has been explored through the use of tangle nets which are able to obtain specimens from areas not reachable by traditional methods of using trawls and dredges.Tangle Net Fishing, an Indigenous Method Used in Balicasag Island, Central Philippines Peter K.

After 5 years in the battle circuit, Noa realized that he wanted success as an artist and although he was young he knew he had a big story to tell.Joose Box Interviews Noa James: Who Is Noa James? Over the years James' autobiographical rhymes have made him a pioneer in the art of storytelling and although his powerful stage presence and large stature has made him a force to be reckoned with, it is the size of his heart, that has remained most imminent. Not only making a name for himself as an artist, Noa is also widely known as a leading force in Southern California's Inland Empire underground hip hop movement. Under Black Cloud Music, Noa, along with five other likeminded and passionate artists have been breaking the mold and starting a musical movement that is undeniable and worthy of its growing success. After the release of several independent mixtapes before his Black Cloud affiliation in May 2010, Noa released his first official album on the label entitled Beautiful Darkness, which was well received and respectably noted by both his fans and peers. It was a project of love and labor and showed both sides of James' personality and elaborate mind. Beautiful Darkness is now available in several record stores throughout Los Angeles, the Inland Empire, and Las Vegas. In May 2011, James released Intelligent, Elegant, Elephant: Humble Power, a project that generated quite a larger buzz digitally following his anticipated debut performance at a major hip hop music festival, Paid Dues in San Bernardino, California.

Career =HM Prison Service= Brodie Clark started his career in Her Majesty's Prison Service in 1973 as assistant governor HM Borstal Wetherby, from 1977 to 1981 he was at Acklington prison and from 1981 to 1994 had appointments as governor at Gartree, Bedford prisons and in 1992 he successfully commissioned, opened and governed the New Generation Prison at Milton Keynes, Woodhill prison. In 1994 he was appointed governor to the troubled Whitemoor top security jail. Later that year, six prisoners including Paul Magee and other IRA members, escaped from the prison's Special Secure Unit. All were immediately recaptured. Clark and his top team led the security upgrade at Whitemoor, which set the template for security procedures, practice and technologies across the High Security Prison Estate. In 1999, he was appointed as the Director of High Security Prisons, the 10 Top Security Prisons in England and Wales and from 2000 to 2003 he held the post of Director of Security for the Prison Service. He led a major programme in tightening security arrangements across the prison estate and he made a significant contribution to the reduction of suicides across the prison system. =UK Border Agency= Following some well publicised problems within the Immigration Detention Estate ‚Äì which culminated in the devastating fire at the Yarl's Wood Immigration Removal Centre in February 2002, Clark moved from the Prison Service to join the Immigration and Nationality Department of the Home Office (now UKBA) in 2003 to manage the Detention estate and the Accommodation Centre Programme. A year later he was appointed to head up the UK Immigration Service, whilst retaining his Detention Centre responsibilities. During this period he successfully led the work on the Ministerial target of 'Tipping the Balance' which saw the removal of failed asylum seekers exceed the new monthly stock; he consolidated the border control operation in Northern France (detecting and preventing some 25,000 individuals from making (in some cases repeated) clandestine attempts to reach the UK in 2009 alone) and he built important international links to enhance the global reach of the UK's border control efforts. In April 2008 he was appointed as the Head of UK Border Control and in 2009, following the 'Security in a Global Hub' Review he was charged with the responsibility of integrating the front line border customs operation (HMRC) with the border Immigration operation, thus delivering a more effective policing capability against illegal activity spanning people and goods. By 2010 the 9000 strong multiskilled Border Force was in place. He was appointed a CBE in the 2010 New Year Honours for his contribution to border security. In 2010, with Ministerial approval, he began to introduce a more risk-based approach to delivering improved front line detection ‚Äì partly to increase the efficiency of the overall operation, partly to manage and mitigate the impact of an ¬£85m running cost reduction and partly to line up more effectively with other policing operational approaches. =Suspension and resignation= In summer 2011, the Home Office gave permission for the UK Border Force to introduce a more risk based approach relating to persons entering the United Kingdom on European passports, to ensure a better and more effective use of resources. This procedure was then extended to non-EU citizens, a move which Home Secretary Theresa May said had been undertaken without her knowledge. The Home Secretary made a statement to the House on 7 November 2011 setting out the causes for concern as follows: *First, biometric checks on EEA nationals and Warnings Index checks on EEA national children were abandoned on a regular basis, without ministerial approval. *Biometric checks on non-EEA nationals were also thought to have been abandoned on occasions, without ministerial approval. *Second, adults were not checked against the Warnings Index at Calais, without ministerial approval. *Third, the verification of the fingerprints of non-EEA nationals from countries that require a visa was stopped, without ministerial approval. The Home Office suspended Clark, and carried out a precautionary suspension for two of Clark's senior team: Carole Upshall, director of the Border Force South and Europe, and Graeme Kyle, director of operations at Heathrow Airport. The BBC reported that staff may have been told not to scan biometric passports at certain times. These contain a digital image of the holder's face which can be used to compare with the printed version and check the passport has not been forged. It is also believed that \\"warning index checks\\" at Heathrow Airport and the port of Calais, which would have applied strict security checks against official watchlists of terrorists, criminals, and deported illegal immigrants were also suspended. Three investigations were subsequently commissioned: *One by Dave Wood, ex-Metropolitan Police detective, the UKBA's head of enforcement and crime group. This was a two-week inquiry designed to discover to what extent checks were scaled down, and what the security implications might have been. *One by Mike Anderson, an ex-MI6 official, director general of the strategy, immigration and international group at the Home Office. This was to investigate wider issues relating to the performance of UKBA. *It was announced on 5 November 2011 by Theresa May that an independent inquiry would also be undertaken, led by the Chief Inspector of the UK Border Agency, John Vine. Mr Vine completed his report on 7 February 2012 and it was published on 20 February 2012.http://icinspector.independent.gov.uk/wp- content/uploads/2012/02/2012-02-20-Report-of-the-UKBA-ICI-Report3.pdf In the event, the Anderson enquiry did not proceed. An additional and separate 'leak enquiry' was also commissioned into the circumstances around damaging and critical information and misinformation reaching the press about Clark and, separately, a draft of the Woods enquiry allegedly being provided to the press. The Vine Report was a public document, published in February 2012 ‚Äì highlighting the need for a more effective operating mandate between Ministers and officials; flagging up poor record keeping within the Border Force and requiring Ministers to be clearer on their requirements in respect of standards, policy and decisions. Neither the Wood Report nor the leak enquiry have been published and the Home Office has been rigorous in refusing to declare the findings. On 8 November 2011 Clark formally resigned from the UK Border Agency insisting that comments made by the Home Secretary, Theresa May amounted to constructive dismissal and that he would launch legal proceedings. In mid-March 2012, it was reported that Mr Clark had reached an out-of-court settlement with the Home Office, avoiding the need for both parties to go to an Employment Tribunal. It was also reported that under the settlement, neither Mr Clark nor the Home Office admitted any liability or wrongdoing, and that the amount of the settlement would not be disclosed. It was further reported that while the sum of money paid to Mr Clark to settle the case was undisclosed, and that while the settlement might save time and legal costs for the Government, it also meant that the full account of what had happened ‚Äì which had led to the UK Border Agency's being split in two ‚Äì might never be disclosed. On 12 July 2012, a note on page 33 of the UK Border Agency's Annual Report and Accounts 2011‚Äì2012 made the following declaration: \\"Mr Clark resigned on 8 November 2011. A settlement payment of ¬£225,000 was subsequently made without an admission of liability or wrongdoing from either side. The costs associated with Mr Clark are included within the accounts of the Home Office along with the other costs of Border Force, which became a directorate of the Home Office on 1 March\\". On 26 July 2012, BBC News reported Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Committee, as saying in hindsight that Mr Clark's departure had been \\"totally unnecessary\\" and had happened because \\"everyone panicked\\". Mr Vaz (in an apparent vindication of Mr Clark's risk-based approach to checks and queue management) was further reported as saying that \\"the home secretary's decision to suspend the risk-based approach was wrong ... I think we need to leave it to experienced officers to decide whether or not they need to check everybody 100%\\". =Home Affairs Committee= The Home Affairs Committee took evidence from several of the people involved in the matter of Brodie Clark's suspension: *8 November 2011 ‚Äì Rt Hon Theresa May MP, Home Secretary *15 November 2011 ‚Äì Brodie Clark, former Head of the Border Force and Rob Whiteman, Chief Executive, UKBA *22 November 2011 ‚Äì Damian Green MP, Immigration Minister and Dame Helen Ghosh DCB, Permanent Secretary, Home Office *8 December 2011 ‚Äì Jonathan Sedgwick, acting Chief Executive, UKBA, in charge after Lin Homer left to become Permanent Secretary at the Department for Transport and before the appointment of Rob Whiteman. On the same day, the Committee published some written evidence submitted by Brodie Clark. On 19 January 2012, the Committee published its report, Inquiry into the provision of UK Border Controls. The main burden of its findings was that the Committee could reach no reasoned conclusions because, despite first promising to do so, the Home Office eventually refused to make relevant information available to the Committee (para.27): *... we would normally expect a Government of any party to acquiesce to such a request from a Select Committee. We recommend that the Home Secretary deposit copies of all the documents that have been made available to the three internal investigations in the Library of this House. This will allow this Committee to reach an informed conclusion of our own and would be consistent with the Government's commitment to transparency and accountability ...

The Lawson Adit is a horizontal mine tunnel, or adit, on the UC Berkeley campus, near the Hearst Mining Building, dug directly through the Hayward Fault. Started in 1916, the adit is named after Andrew Lawson, one-time Dean of the College of Mining at UC Berkeley.  History  The adit was dug under the direction of Frank H. Probert, who had just previously been appointed Professor of Mining. It was dug primarily for instructional purposes, with secondary hopes that it would represent a new source of water for the campus. Much of the equipment to dig and use the tunnel was donated by the mining industry in the San Francisco Bay area. Although an initial report said that it was to go 1,800 feet into the Berkeley Hills, the actual construction resulted in a mine tunnel of about 200 feet. Berkeley School of Mining students at the entrance to Lawson Adit in 1918 during a mine rescue drill. One of the men is carrying a box from the Hercules Powder Company. Between 1919 and 1930 the adit was used to give mining and metallurgy students hands-on training, specifically to provide \\"sound, practical training in drilling, drifting, blasting, timbering, and mine surveying.\\" This training included instruction in the use of dynamite as well as the extraction of precious metals and practice and demonstration of rescuing techniques. In 1935, Berkeley engineering students celebrated the annual March 15 Engineers' Day by putting together \\"a museum of historical electrical equipment,\\" holding a dance at the Hotel Claremont, and engaging in a \\"mine rescue\\" in the Lawson Adit next to the Hearst Memorial Mining Building. Around 1939 the adit was extended to around 900 feet so that it intersected the Hayward Fault and could be used for a direct study of the fault by George Louderback, a seismologist at UC Berkeley, to help determine the safety of building a new women's dormitory, Stern Hall. Louderback's studies in the adit revealed that the Hayward Fault at this point is surrounded by a particularly unstable m√©lange of serpentine and other metamorphic rocks. He suggested that Stern Hall be built approximately fifty feet away from its original planned location. After 1939, much of the extended adit eventually collapsed, with most collapses around the point where the adit intersects the fault. Today the adit is only maintained to a length of about 260 feet, and is not in use due to safety reasons.

Chorlton Poor Law Union was founded in January 1837 in response to the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, also known as the New Poor Law. It was overseen by an elected board of 19 guardians representing the 12 parishes in the area it served: Ardwick, Burnage, Chorlton-upon-Medlock, Chorlton with Hardy, Didsbury, Gorton, Hulme, Levenshulme, Mosside, Rusholme, Stretford, and Withington, all (apart from Stretford) in present day south Manchester, England. Background The Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 placed a legal responsibility on parishes to take responsibility for the poor in their areas by organising into poor law unions, each of which was to have at least one workhouse. The Act discouraged the provision of poor relief except through entry into workhouses, and signalled the construction of more than 500 across England and Wales during the next 50 years. The townships in the union, Ardwick, Burnage, Chorlton-upon-Medlock, Chorlton with Hardy, Didsbury, Gorton, Hulme, Levenshulme, Mosside, Rusholme, Stretford, and Withington were in the ancient parish of Manchester; in 1838 Ardwick, Chorlton-upon-Medlock and Hulme were made part of the town of Manchester. The others, apart from Stretford, subsequently became part of the City of Manchester. Early history The Ormond Building, Cavendish Street The union's first workhouse, the Stretford Road Workhouse, offered accommodation for 300 inmates, with segregated living areas for various categories of paupers, such as children, lunatics, the elderly, and the sick; female inmates were housed in the west of the building and males in the east, separated by a central communal dining hall and chapel. The population of the area served by the Chorlton Poor Law Union had been 46,465 at the time of the 1831 census, but as it rapidly increased during Manchester's industrialisation it became clear that the capacity of the Stretford Road Workhouse was inadequate for the demands placed on it. As the Stretford Road site offered no scope for expansion the guardians decided to commission the construction of a second workhouse, the Withington Workhouse. Opened in 1855, and costing ¬£53,000 to build, the new workhouse was able to accommodate up to 1500 inmates. The site also included a new cemetery to serve the union's area, the Chorlton Union Cemetery, which remained in use until 1920. The Offices of the Poor Law Guardians were built in 1881. The building was designed by Mangnall & Littlewood and also included a registry office. Since 1970 it has been used by the polytechnic.Hartwell, Clare (2001), Manchester, Pevsner Architectural Guides, Penguin Books, pp. 130‚Äì131 Emmeline Pankhurst was a member of the Board of Guardians. Later developments In 1910 the Chorlton Union was consolidated into the South Manchester Township, which in turn became part of a unified Manchester Union in 1915, and the workhouse was renamed Withington Hospital.

She was sighted by the captain of a passing vessel, the SS Algonquin, around noon of that day but minutes later disappeared. The wreck of the ship has never been found, with the exception of an oar and a life preserver, and no bodies were ever recovered. Within a year of her disappearance she acquired a reputation as a ghost ship and became known as The Flying Dutchman of the Great Lakes. History of the ship prior to sinking The Bannockburn had technically sunk once before, on the morning of October 15, 1897: under Captain John Irving, laden with grain and destined for Kingston, Ontario from Chicago, Illinois, she had struck the wing wall of Lock No. 17 of Welland Canal and sprung a leak sending her to the bottom of the shallow canal where she took on nine feet of water before coming to rest. However, no lives were lost and she was raised afterward. She had also been badly damaged several months prior when she ran on the rocks near Snake Island Light on the morning of April 27 while at full speed‚Äîhowever, after dumping 30,000 bushels of grain cargo she was able to float and again no lives were lost though her forefoot and frame were badly stove in. Chronology of disappearance The final voyage of the Bannockburn began at the Canadian lakehead near what is now known as Thunder Bay, under Captain George R. Wood. She was downbound carrying 85,000 bushels of wheat, leaving the city of Fort William on November 20 and headed for Georgian Bay. She suffered a slight grounding but no apparent damage on her way out to the open lake, and her departure was delayed one day. She recommenced her journey on the 21st. Sometime that day, Captain James McMaugh of the upbound Algonquin, another lake freighter, reported viewing her through binoculars about to the southeast of him, about off Keweenaw Point and off Isle Royale. He was well-acquainted with her profile and he stated that he viewed her \\"several times\\" over the course of a few minutes to note her progress, which was very nearly on course. At a certain moment, however, he attempted to spot her and was surprised that he was unable to do so. He blamed this sudden disappearance on the somewhat foggy weather, and dismissed it. A powerful winter storm raked Lake Superior that night. At 11:00 pm the nightwatch pilothouse crew of the passenger steamer Huronic, also upbound on the lake, reported seeing lights on a ship they passed in the storm which they believed were in the pattern of those of the Bannockburn. However, no signals of distress were observed, and the two ships passed each other without incident. The Bannockburn was reported overdue the following morning at the Soo Locks, but given the weather the previous night, this was not considered unusual. When she still did not report several days later, however, the fear that she had been lost began to grow. On November 25 the steamer John D. Rockefeller passed through a field of floating debris near Stannard Rock Light which might have been that of the Bannockburn, though at this time the Bannockburn had not yet been reported lost and the crew of the Rockefeller did not know what might have caused the debris field. By November 30, the ship and crew were officially given up as \\"lost\\". By November 26, under pressure from the increasingly distressed families of the crew, a Mr. L.L. Henderson, a manager of the Montreal Transportation Company, claimed he had received a wire from the Chicago office of the underwriter's association which was providing insurance coverage for the ship. He told a local newspaper, The Fort Williams Times Journal, that the message read: \\"The steamer Bannockburn Has been located on the north shore of Lake Superior opposite Michipicoten Island. Crew safe.\\" He later admitted he had no positive information as to her whereabouts but had based his hopeful assertion on news he had heard from the Germanic, another freighter, that she had been seen safely anchored there. Eventually the underwriters came to the conclusion that the Bannockburn had stranded on Caribou Island. This island is surrounded by a dangerous reef, and its lighthouse had been intentionally turned off on November 15. If the captain of the Bannockburn had been hoping to spot its warning light in the darkness of the storm on the 21st, the only evidence he would have had of his closing proximity would have been the shock of the hull striking the reef itself. On Friday, December 12, the Captain of the Grand Marais Lifesaving Station found a cork life preserver from the Bannockburn washed up on the beach. This item is the only known wreckage from the ship ever to have been recovered. Captain Wood, from Port Dalhousie, Ontario, was the oldest person aboard the vessel, at age 37. Most of the crew were between the ages of 17 and 20. His first mate, Alex Graham, was also from Port Dalhousie, Ontario. One of the ship's two wheelsmen, Arthur Callaghan, was only 16. Although the ship was considered to be of recent manufacture (at nine years old it was still thought of as almost new) the overall inexperience of her crew might have been a factor in her being lost. Such young crews, however, were common on the Great Lakes at the turn of the 20th century because they were inexpensive to hire and shipping firms had strong financial incentives and no legislative reason not to take advantage of this whenever they might. There are many theories as to what went wrong. Captain McMaugh proposed that the ship might have experienced a boiler explosion though he did not hear one and no charred wreckage typical of such an explosion was later found anywhere along the route that the Bannockburn was known to have taken. Alternatively, the at-that-time uncharted danger of the Superior Shoal might also have been the cause. When the Soo locks were drained at the end of that season, a hull plate from a ship was found in the lock.

A sequel was released entitled Squids Wild West, and a spin-off called Squids Odyssey was also released. The object of the game is to defeat a range of aquatic enemies with a party of up to four anthropomorphic squids, which belong to one of four character classes: stomper (melee fighter), shooter (ranged fighter), scout or healer. Combat is turn-based, but not grid-bound: squids are flicked across the playing field by a motion of the player's finger, bumping like billiard-balls into enemies to attack them. In between the linear (but repeatable) levels, which are interconnected by cutscenes that develop the game's story, players can level up their squids or enhance them with items that can be bought with pearls, which in turn are found in-game or available to purchase for real currency. The game was well received upon its release, obtaining a 76% aggregated score on Metacritic by the start of November 2011. Gamezebo praised the game's \\"pitch-perfect\\" gameplay, graphics and sound. TouchArcade appreciated the game's \\"inventive, grid-less, and active\\" combat mechanic, but criticized the ability to purchase pearls as unbalancing.

History  Around the period from 850 to 870, the hermit Liutbirg, who was highly respected by her contemporaries, lived in a retreat. She was a close confidante of bishops Haimo of Halberstadt and Ansgar of Bremen. Until the 1930s, her retreat was believed to have been at Volkmarskeller, until Walther Grosse was able to show that it could have been at Wendhusen Abbey near Thale. Either way, the church near the cave of Volkmarskeller was dedicated to St. Michael and was gifted in 956 by Otto I to Quedlinburg Abbey. From then on, the cave, which was not far from the imperial hunting lodge of Bodfeld, provided shelter for pious settlers. For example, the death of a certain Bernhardus presbyter solitarius de Laide sancti Michaelis was recorded in 1118. According to the Annales Cistercienses, after several years of preparation that had begun in 1135, the cave and church was officially opened on 28 July 1146 as accommodation for Cistercian monks from Kamp Abbey under Abbot Roger. In 1146, at the request of the Abbess of Quedlinburg, Beatrix II, Pope Innocent II approved the founding of the abbey and the allocation to the monastery of estates in Marsleben, Gro√ü- and Klein-Ditfurt, S√ºlten and other places (today mostly abandoned villages near Quedlinburg). These had already been donated to the Quedlinburg Abbey in 1138/39 by Quedlinburg ministerialis, Burchard. In the period from 1151 to 1167, the monastery was moved to Evergodesrode at the lower end of the valley at the present site of Michaelstein Abbey. The ruined cave dwellings were excavated in 1884-1887 by architect (Baurat) Brinkmann and made accessible.  Tourism  The Volkmarskeller can be visited free of charge. It is located in the upper part of the monastery grounds, just above the trail that leads from Michaelstein Abbey to the hamlet of Egger√∂der Brunnen. At the Volkmarskeller is a checkpoint (no. 87) in the Harzer Wandernadel hiking network. The nearest car park is in Egger√∂der Brunnen which is about 15 minutes walk away.Harzer Wandernadel official map, Sheet 2, 1:50,000 (2008). Not far away is the former iron ore pit of Volkmar. In 1893, there was an explosion here that was caused by the complications of handling dynamite at temperatures below 7 ¬∞C. The H√ºttenrode Alpine Club erected a memorial in 2007 to the miners who were killed. This is on the track and trail between Egger√∂der Brunnen-Volkmarskeller and Michaelstein Abbey at Blankenburg.

His work focuses on typology and historical linguistics of Tibeto- Burman languages as well as North American indigenous languages such as the Penutian family, particularly the Klamath. His research is known for its diversity of its thematic and theoretical reach.Linda Konnerth, 'Review', in Himalayan Linguistics, Vol.13, No.1 pp.94-99.

Himalayan Linguistics Journal, 2010 Vol. 9, No.1, pp.1-39. Sino-Tibetan linguistics He is currently undertaking field research on several Tibeto-Burman languages of North-Eastern India. Sinitic he takes, like others, to be typologically a mainland south east Asian language.Laurent Sagart, Roots of Old Chinese, John Benjamins Publishing, 1999 p.13:'From a typological point of view, Old Chinese was more similar to modern East Asian languages like Gyarong, Khmer or Atayal than to its daughter language Middle Chinese,' The Chinese mainland consensus on Sino-Tibetan theory holds that the Sino-Tibetan language family descends from a single linguistic ancestor that accounts for shared features of monosyllabism, tonal features, and isolating characteristics. Some of these may, however, have arisen from early borrowing between members now included in this language family. The history of Vietnamese, to cite one example, shows how an originally atonal, polysyllabic language can, under Chinese influence, adopt the characteristics of the latter.Zev Handel, 'The Classification of Chinese (Sinitic (The Chinese Language Family),‚Äò in William S-Y. Wang, Chaofen Sun, (eds.) The Oxford Handbook of Chinese Linguistics, Oxford University Press 2015 pp.35-44.p.38.Scott DeLancey, 'Language replacement and the spread of Tibeto- Burman,' Journal of the Southeast Asian Linguistics Society, 2010, vol. 3.1 pp.40-55, pp.43-44: 'Sinitic is typologically a Mainland Southeast Asian family. The dramatic typological divergence, most conspicuously the word order realignment, between Sinitic and Tibeto-Burman reflects a massive reorganization of an originally Tibeto-Burman grammar. This must have been a result of intense contact with Tai and other languages which Sinitic encountered when it migrated eastward into China. The original formation of Chinese resulted through contact between invaders, identified with the Chou dynasty, speaking a SOV Tibeto-Burman-type language, and the indigenous SVO language of the Shang (Benedict 1972, Nishida 1976, see also van Driem 1997, 2008). The substantial vocabulary shared by Sinitic, Tai, and Vietnamese, as well as the astonishing degree of phonological and syntactic convergence among these languages, points to a period of intense contact along and south of the Yangzi (Ballard 1984), involving Blench‚Äôs (2009ms) ‚ÄúSouthern Yunnan Interaction Sphere‚Äù. The morphosyntactic profile which Sinitic shares with Kadai, Hmong-Mien, and the Mon-Khmer languages of Vietnam and Cambodia is strikingly similar to the so-called creole prototype.' DeLancey has developed the hypothesis that the growth of the Shang state may have led to the adoption of its language as a lingua franca among the southern Baiyue and the Sino- Tibetan speaking Zhou to the west, creating a common lexical stock. According to this theory, the emergence of the Zhou within the Shang state strengthened a Sino-Tibetan component, which, on the accession of the Zhou to dynastic power, subjected the lingua franca to a process of creolization with a stronger Zhou Sino-Tibetan lexicon while building on a morphology inherited from Shang dynasty speakers. Sinitic in his view fits a Mainland Southeast Asian typology. The sum effect of this hypothetical Zhou diffusion of their version of the lingua franca was, he argues, one of Tibeto-Burmanization, with a concomitant shift from a SVO morphological substrate to a language with an increasing tendency towards SOV structure.Scott De Lancey, 'The origins of Sinitic,‚Äô in Zhuo Jing-Schmidt (ed.) Increased Empiricism: Recent advances in Chinese Linguistics, John Benjamins Publishing Co. 2013 pp.73-99 pp.91-2, p.91: ‚ÄòWhen Zhou takes over the empire, there is, as on Benedict‚Äôs model, a temporary diglossic situation, in which genuine Zhou speech is, for a while, retained in the ruling class, but among the former Shang population, Shang speech is gradually replaced not by ‚Äúpure‚Äù Sino-Tibetan Zhou, but by a heavily Tibeto-Burman influenced version of the lingua franca.‚Äô DeLancey also proposed a new Tibeto-Burman subgroup, namely Central Tibeto-Burman.

The Milagres Church was originally established in 1680, as a result of a treaty between Rani Chennamma of Bednur and the Portuguese, and rebuilt in present form in 1881. The Church was upgraded to Cathedral status in 2012, giving a desirable fillip to the Konkani Catholic people. History During the period of the Keladi Nayakas, Kallianpur emerged as an important Christian settlement in South Canara. The church was constructed by the Portuguese in 1678, and dedicated to Our Lady of Miracles. The land on which the church was built was gifted to the local Christians by Rani Chennammaji and Somashekara Nayaka I. The miraculous statue of Milagres Kallianpur extracted from writings of Mr. Charles E. G Lewis Kallianpur dated 1982. The statue of Our Lady of Milagres, Kallianpur is popularly claimed to be miraculous in and around the surrounding region. when the English lost war in 1784, Tipu Sultan gave secret orders to his commanders to seize all Christians in Canara and take them captive to Srirangapatana. They carried out the secret orders and entered every Christian settlement simultaneously throughout Kanara. Complete families with children in arms were brutally hounded, herded and marched captive across the Western Ghats. Only a few people managed to stay in hiding. The churches were destroyed and also were the churches at Barkur and Patre. The priests had gone into hiding or had been captured and deported to Goa. It was this time the enemy soldiers played havoc destroying everything and they attempted to remove the Statue of our Lady on the High Altar for desecration. They found it was not possible to remove it or lift it with hands. She would not move. She would not yield. They used force with tools but without success. But at that very moment, a large swarm of bees (wasps) suddenly came upon them unknown from where and attacked and stung them. They ran helter shelter, the venomous bees followed them. They rode down as far as the Suvarna River; the wasps still pursued them until the soldiers dived and tried to hide in the water. This occurrence was known far and wide in the area and produced awe and reverence among the people including Non-Christians to Our Lady their ‚ÄòMILAGRI AMMA‚Äô. At that time one of the parishioners who was in hiding Mr. Menino Francies Luis of Nadu Kudru, Tonse, secretly carried away the Miraculous Statue from the devastated church after much praying and promising that he would bring and place her with due honour when the ordeal would be over. He carried her to his ancient home in Thonse and venerated it secretly with his family and the rest of the Christians in night vigils with rosary and reading of the Christian Purana of Fr. Thomas Stevens S.J. The statue had sometimes to be hidden in other houses and specially one Hindu house whose descendants were honoured every year with a candle on the occasion of the Annual parish feast. When things brightened up with the enemies death and Priests came after return of Christians from captivity, the Miraculous Statue was brought back with great honour and Jubilation amidst rejoicing through the river and road in a colourful two mile long route boat procession and re-enthroned in the church on the high Altar(currently installed in the Shrine ). In memory and honour of this event a yearly boat procession of our Lady on a gaily and artistically decorated throne ( Cherell) with much solemnity grandeur and pomp was celebrated at first from Nadu Kudru to the church on the eve of the parish feast from the ancient house of Mr. Menino Francis Luis; but in the latter years the procession was from its neighbouring Honappa Kudru from a house of his direct descendants for over a century. In the final years the procession commenced from Our Lady‚Äôs Island Property of Barikudru due to uncertainty of tides to bring it from Tonse. Glowing accounts of the grandeur of those annual evening festive processions and the devotion generated when all communities joined the celebrations with decorative lamps, arches and buntings on its route were narrated with pride and nostalgia for those days by men of the generation that has now passed. It would be interesting to know another tradition. The statue used for those processions is the one now used for Cherell in the church for processions on the feast days. This statue was found on the Malpe shore and was delivered by the fisher men to the church. It is believed to be the statue placed by Vasco da Gama on the Thonse Par Islands when he landed there and which were named by him as St. Mary's Islands.

Biography Guy Sircello was born in Tacoma, Washington, and attended Lincoln High School. His parents were Pete and Teresa Sircello, and he had a younger sister, Teresa. Upon high school graduation, he was awarded the prestigious George Baker full four-year scholarship to Reed College, in Portland, Oregon, and graduated in 1958 with a double major in philosophy and history. In 1960, he married Sharon Chapin, a fellow Reed graduate, and shortly after, they left New York for Hamburg, where he had a Fulbright grant to further his studies of Ernst Cassirer, the subject of his doctoral dissertation at Columbia University. In Hamburg, the Sircello's first child, Maria Anne Sircello was born, and the family returned to New York with another daughter as well, an adopted daughter, Deborah Ruth Sircello. In New York, the family grew as the Sircellos also became foster parents to Deborah's brothers, Billie, Alexander, and Constantine (Stan). In 1963, another daughter, Pier Andrea, was born in New York City just prior to the family's move to Portland, so that Guy could join the Reed faculty. In Portland, in 1965, another daughter, Anne-Marie Sircello was born, not long after the death of Maria Anne, who had been born with multiple serious disabilities. In 1966, the entire family of eight moved to Irvine, and finally, in 1967, the final child of the Sircello family, Christopher Chapin Sircello, was born. Guy was an attentive and involved father, and enjoyed family camping outings to Yosemite, a three-month family camping trip to Europe, and visits to museums, concerts, and the ballet. He was a major influence, along with Sharon, in three of his children becoming professional dancers, two others becoming professional visual artists, and another an accomplished amateur pianist. The Sircellos separated, and later divorced after 15 years of marriage. Sircello was a Professor of Philosophy at the University of California Irvine from 1966 until his death in 1992 at the age of 55.Obituary from University of California Irvine He earned his PhD from Columbia University in 1965. He taught at Reed College before becoming a founding member of UC Irvine's Philosophy department. While at Irvine he served as Associate Dean of Undergraduate Studies from 1973 to 1977, Dean of Undergraduate Studies from 1978 to 1983, Chair of the Committee on Educational Policy from 1988 to 1989, and as the Philosophy Department's Director of Graduate Studies from 1990 until his death. Sircello was active in the American Society for Aesthetics and served as the President of its Pacific Division from 1978 to 1979. His emphasis was in analytic philosophy of aesthetics, and he was best known for what he called his New Theory of Beauty Philosophical work Sircello's book Love and Beauty (1989) provides a sketch of his theory, which encompasses such topics as arousal, expansion, sublimity, and indulgence. He considers the implications of his theory for aesthetics and ethics. He also develops theories of pleasure, quality, beauty and love. =Introduction= According to Sircello, philosophers have usually failed to understand and theorize properly about certain fundamental human modalities. Among these is the human relation to and feeling for beauty. In particular, Sircello found it dismaying that among philosophers the ancient conception of love of beauty had been displaced by other human concerns. His last book, Love and Beauty, was intended to provide a theory to begin to fill the void left by this loss of interest.Love and Beauty, Princeton University Press, 1989,chapter 1. =Pleasure= Sircello distinguishes pleasure from enjoyment. He uses propositional pleasure as an example of a particular type of pleasure distinct from enjoyment.Love and Beauty, Princeton University Press, 1989, chapter 2 Propositional pleasure is characterized as a pleasure taken in the occurrence of a fact, event, state or the like. Such pleasure is relatively passive. We may take pleasure in the outcome of a ball game or in the fact that traffic is light on the way to work, but the pleasure itself resulting from this satisfaction is something that happens to the subject rather than something they effect. Enjoyment is constituted by the active role played by the subject. Enjoyment can be obtained from experiences that are not entirely pleasant in all their parts via effort or resolve on the part of the subject. For instance, a strenuous hike can be enjoyable even though parts of it may be difficult and painful. The subject's resolve and ability to overcome difficulties can make the hike enjoyable despite these troubles. Enjoyment involves a complex relationship to desire in that enjoyment tends to fuel further desires for its continuation. As such enjoyment of experience is fundamental in Sircello's theory of love.Love and Beauty, Princeton University Press, 1989,chapter 2. =Qualities= Central to Sircello's philosophy is his theory of qualities. He defines the precise sense in which he uses this term through the concept of Properties of Qualitative Difference (or PQDs).Barrett, Cyril. \\"The NTB and its PQDs.\\" Review of Guy Sircello's A New Theory of Beauty. TLS [Times Literary Supplement] (December 17, 1976), 3901:1594. Such properties are to be distinguished from quantitative properties. According to his theory, it is the perception of qualities that lies at the center of the experience of beauty.Fletcher, James J. Review of Guy Sircello's A New Theory of Beauty. Review of Metaphysics (September 1976), 30(1):139-140 According to Sircello qualities come in four main varieties. These constitute four ways in which we experience our world. :* Qualities that qualify our own actions: Qualities such as those we experience when we perceive or remember our own actions fall in this category. Two examples used by Sircello are ‚Äúmy gentleness when I speak‚Äù and ‚Äúmy efficiency when I work‚Äù.Love and Beauty, Princeton University Press, 1989, chapter 9, p. 38) These qualities comprise a major part of our experience of ourselves in our everyday lives. :* Qualities that we experience as qualifying the actions of others: We may experience the grace of another‚Äôs movements, or the stubbornness of their attitude. Sircello also includes in this category qualities perceived as being expressed by others in photographs, movies, painting, sculptures and so on. So, we may perceive another's stolidness or joviality in a photo or video as well in first hand encounters. :* Qualities that are experienced as ‚Äútracks‚Äù of the actions of ourselves or of others: Sircello defines ‚Äútracks‚Äù as ‚Äúobjects‚Äù that we may experience as the result of actions of sentient beings, either ourself or others. Tracks need not actually be the result of such actions but are objects that can be perceived as such, in the way that a landscape might be regarded as a trace of the hand of a creator. Sircello provides many examples of tracks in his book. For example, the mark left by the tracing of your hand in the sand or the streak of light left by the movement of a firework sparkler through the air.Love and Beauty, Princeton University Press, 1989, chapter 9, p. 40) :* Qualities experienced by a person as belonging to an ‚Äúobject‚Äù of any sort under the following two conditions: a) the quality is experienced as either like the act, trace or representation of an act of a sentient being and b) the quality is experienced by that person as belonging to that act, trace or representation: Perhaps too briefly, the quality may be experienced as being an act of the ‚Äúobject‚Äù being considered. Examples of this type of quality are: ‚ÄúA calm sea might be seen as if it were resting calmly. In the delicate rustling of the leaves of a tree we might see the tree as delicately moving its limbs.\\"Love and Beauty, Princeton University Press, 1989, chapter 9, p. 42) =Beauty= Common wisdom tells us that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Sircello's philosophy runs counter to this maxim.Beardsley, Monroe C. \\"The Refutation of Relativism.\\" Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism (Spring 1983), 41(3):269, 270n4 He maintained that beauty is objective in a very particular way.Iseminger, Gary. Review of Guy Sircello's Love and Beauty. Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism (Spring 1991), 49(2):167-168. His starting point is the recognition that when a judgment of beauty is made there is something about the object that is thought to be beautiful. For example, if an alpine sunset seen as beautiful, this is due to the quality of light expressed in the sunset, or perhaps because of the intense depth of the vista, or because of some other attribute of the scene that stands out as exceptional in some way. Beauty resides for Sircello in the possession by objects, scenes, actions, and so on of qualities to a very high degree. Qualities of lack, deficiency or defect are excluded from this because these qualities are not enjoyed qualities.Love and Beauty, Princeton University Press, 1989, chapter 7, p. 34)Moore, Ronald. \\"Ugliness.\\" In Michael Kelly, ed., Encyclopedia of Aesthetics, Vol. 4, p. 421. New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998. =Love= Sircello begins his account of love by setting it in relation to enjoyment. To distance some of the standard associations with the term ‚Äúlove,‚Äù Sircello uses the capitalized form, Love, in a technical sense. Fundamental to his theory is the notion of reproducing an experience of a quality.Williams, Clifford. Review of Guy Sircello's Love and Beauty. International Philosophical Quarterly (December 1990), 30(4):501-502. Reproductions by S a subject may be regarded as recollections, repetitions or recreations of images, memories, thoughts, actions, feelings, or states that are parts of the experience. Sircello presents his theory through the four principles paraphrased below: # For any subject S, any quality for S (Qs), and any experience of Qs by S, if S is Loving this experience, then there is some part or parts of the experience that S is reproducing such that what S produces are themselves parts of the experience.Love and Beauty, Princeton University Press, 1989, chapter 25, p. 123) # For any subject S, any quality for S (Qs), and any experience of Qs by S, S is Loving this experience only if the S's reproducing parts of the experience both arouses and satisfies S's desire to so reproduce.Love and Beauty, Princeton University Press, 1989, chapter 25, p. 124) # For any subject S, any quality for S (Qs), and any experience of Qs by S, if S is reproducing part or parts of the experience such that what S so reproduces are part(s) of the experience, and if such reproducing both arouses and satisfies S's desire to so reproduce, then S is Loving the experience. # For any subject S and any ‚Äúobject‚Äù for S, if S is Loving the ‚Äúobject‚Äù, then there is (at least) some experience for S involved with the ‚Äúobject‚Äù that S is Loving.Love and Beauty, Princeton University Press, 1989, chapter 25, p. 125) Selected works Books by Guy SircelloSelected bibliography from UC Irvine Library * Mind & Art: An Essay on the Varieties of Expression.

Davis is a researcher in biotechnology and molecular genetics, particularly active in human and yeast genomics and the development of new technologies in genomics, with over 30 biotechnology patents. In 2013, it was said of Davis that \\"A substantial number of the major genetic advances of the past 20 years can be traced back to Davis in some way.\\" Scientific career After completing his PhD at Caltech and a postdoctoral fellowship at Harvard University working with Jim Watson, Davis joined the faculty of Stanford's Department of Biochemistry in 1972. He became an Associate Professor in 1980, full Professor in 1980, and joined the Department of Genetics as a professor in 1990. He became director of the Stanford Genome Technology Center in 1994. He was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1983. Davis developed the R-loop technique of electron microscopy for mapping coding RNAs which led to the discovery of RNA splicing. With Janet E. Mertz, Davis was the first to demonstrate the use of restriction endonucleases for joining DNA fragments. Davis collaborated in the development of the first DNA microarray for gene expression profiling with Patrick O. Brown, and the gene expression profile of the first complete eukaryotic genome (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Davis, with David Botstein, Mark Skolnick, and Ray White developed the method for constructing a genetic linkage map using restriction fragment length polymorphisms that enabled and led to the Human Genome Project. He and his colleagues submitted a proposal to NIH to map the human genome in 1979; that proposal was turned down as being too ambitious. The Stanford Genome Technology Center was included in the Human Genome Project that began in 1990 and was completed in 2003. Recognition and awards In 2013 Davis was named, alongside Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, as one of today‚Äôs nine greatest innovators by The Atlantic: \\"A substantial number of the major genetic advances of the past 20 years can be traced back to Davis in some way.\\" He has won recognition for his contributions to genetic research from many groups, as early as 1976 and as recently as 2015, from one of his alumni colleges and from the National Academy of Sciences. Starting from his most recent award, here are awards and recognition Davis has received for his achievements in and contributions to science. In 2015, he received the Precision Medicine World Conference Luminary Award for his development of ‚ÄúR-loop Technique of Electron Microscopy‚Äù. In 2013, he received the Warren Alpert Foundation Prize. He received the Gruber Prize in Genetics in 2011, which noted among other achievements, two landmark papers, one in 1977 concerning genome editing and another in 1980 which \\"helped launch the field of genomics.\\" In 2007, California Institute of Technology gave him its Distinguished Alumni Award. In 2005, Davis received the Dickson Prize in Medicine. In 2004, he received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Genetics Society of America. The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) gave him the 1982 NAS Award in Molecular Biology. In 1976, he received the Eli Lilly Award in Microbiology and Immunology. Open Medicine Foundation Dr. Davis is the director of the Scientific Advisory Board at the Open Medicine Foundation, a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization (EIN# 26-4712664), whose goal is to fund and initiate research into chronic complex diseases. Presently the foundation is invested in The End ME/CFS Project, which aims to fast-track research for a cure for myalgic encephalomyelitis / chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). In April 2019, a notable result was reported; a test of blood without red cells (white cells in plasma), identified ME/CFS patients from healthy people with 100% accuracy in a small sample, 20 patients and 20 healthy people. The test used a biotechnological device designed by Davis and his team, which is called the \\"nanoneedle\\". ‚ÄúThe small device that Davis and his colleagues created was originally developed to detect changes in electrical signals when cancer cells were exposed to different treatments.‚Äù, as described in Stat News. it was used to test cells of ME/CFS patients, and in their first hypothesis, found it to be useful in distinguishing patients from healthy people. People with this disease are described as not using energy well and taking a long time to recover from energy expenditure; ‚Äúthe researchers decided to mimic this by stressing cells from 20 healthy controls and 20 ME/CFS patients by exposing them to increased levels of salt.‚Äù Rahim Esfandyarpour, lead author of the paper, said ‚ÄúWhen they [cells from ME/CFS patients] face this new environment, their reaction is different than the reaction of healthy cells.‚Äù Family Davis married Janet Dafoe in July 1969. Their son, Whitney Dafoe was born in 1983, followed by their daughter Ashley Davis. Whitney Dafoe became ill with severe ME/CFS around 2009, declining from active and healthy in his career as a photographer to housebound, and by 2015 bed bound from this disease, unable to tolerate sounds and light, unable to do much at all, and eventually unable to eat, drink or speak. As his endurance decreased, Dafoe moved back home in May 2011. His mother cut her work as a clinical psychologist to five hours a week to spend full time on his daily care as he continued declining in function, while Davis continues his research career and helps with his son‚Äôs daily care. Dafoe‚Äôs need for treatment is the motivation for Davis to direct his medical and scientific research efforts toward this disease; he dropped all other projects in hand before his son became so ill.

Description The slender, milk- white shell has an elongate-conic shape. The length of the shell measures between 7.5 mm and 10 mm. The protoconch contains three whorls. These are large, helicoid, rather elevated, and smooth. They have their axis at a right angle to the axis of the later whorls, and are about one-fourth immersed in the first of them. The twelve, scarcely convex whorls of the teleoconch are ornamented between the sutures by three strong, moderately rounded, raised spiral keels, which are separated by channels of about the same width. The first keel is at the summit of the whorl. These raised keels are marked axially by irregular lines of growth while the depressed channels are crossed by numerous more or less equally developed and equally spaced slender axial bands. A trace of the first keel anterior to the periphery may be seen above the suture in several of the last whorls. The white interstices are striate. The periphery of the body whorl is marked by the anterior edge of the third channel. The next keel anterior to this is like those between the sutures. The remainder of the short base is marked by five less strongly developed keels and channels. The space about the umbilical region has faint, wavy spiral striations. The aperture is moderately large, and suboval. The posterior angle is obtuse, slightly effuse at the junction of the outer lip and columella. The outer lip is arcuate. The columella is short, slender, and curved, with a small and very oblique fold near its insertion which scarcely shows in the aperture. The parietal wall is covered by a thin callus.Dall & Bartsch, Notes on Japanese, Indo-Pacific and American Pyramidellidae, Proceedings of U.S. National Museum, vol. XXX no. 1452, p. 344; 1909G.W.
