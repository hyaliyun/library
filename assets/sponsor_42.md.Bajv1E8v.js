History=Founding= According to Elke Garman, co-president of the Valley Village Homeowners Association in 1991, the history of Valley Village went back to the 1930s, when workers at nearby motion picture studios built houses there. The local post office on Magnolia Boulevard canceled all mail with a \\"Valley Village\\" postmark. It was, however, officially a section of North Hollywood. =Separation from North Hollywood= The idea of separating Valley Village from North Hollywood was brought into public light with a meeting of about 300 homeowners at Colfax Avenue Elementary School in December 1985, yet it wasn't until 1991 that Valley Village got seven new blue reflective markers from the city of Los Angeles to mark its borders.Aaron Curtiss, \\"Name Changes, Neighborhood Doesn't,\\" Los Angeles Times, February 13, 1991 Reporter James Quinn of the Los Angeles Times wrote that Valley Village no longer wanted to be associated with North Hollywood, \\"a community that has grown old, heavily Latino and crime-plagued,\\" but, in the same article, Valley Village leader Tom Paterson was quoted as saying that the move \\"was more than an attempt to boost property values\\" and that it \\"had nothing to do with ethnic demographics.\\" Rather, he said, \\"It was one economic level seeking to have its own identity.\\" Quinn wrote that: > Houses along Valley Village's lushly landscaped, graffiti-free streets cost > up to $800,000, and a two-bedroom, two-bath entry-level house will run > $300,000, residents say. Elsewhere in North Hollywood, that same size entry- > level house can be purchased for as little as $150,000, real estate agents > say. And the cheaper house is likely to have an overgrown, dusty yard and to > be in a neighborhood reeling from crime, with gang graffiti splattered on > block walls and street signs. ='Stucco mountains'= In December 1985, some three hundred homeowners gathered at Colfax Avenue Elementary School to begin a campaign to head off development of what they called \\"stucco mountains\\" – continued construction of large apartments and office buildings in the area. Councilman Joel Wachs said he would support the drive, although he rejected the details of a proposed advisory panel for the area. He said a proposed panel of homeowners might overlook the concerns of renters and the need for rental housing.Marc Igler, \\"North Hollywood Growth Cap Sought,\\" Los Angeles Times, December 19, 1985 Residents complained about blocked views, parking problems and traffic congestion because of buildings as high as five stories next to their single- family homes. The measure would not have banned construction but would have limited all new buildings to two stories and the square footage of commercial development to 1 1/2 times the size of the lot. The plan had the support of Valley Village resident Tom Paterson, president of the Valley Village Homeowners Association, but the opposition of, for one, Marvin Eisenman, an apartment-building owner who said it would not be fair to landowners who purchased property with the idea of developing it.Thomas Omestad, \\"Ferraro Backs Growth Curbs for Valley Village,\\" Los Angeles Times, October 10, 1986 It was touted as a temporary measure until city planners could conduct public hearings on new, permanent development limits.Richard Simon, \\"Lobbied Council Flip-Flops on Builder Curbs,\\" Los Angeles Times, October 15, 1986 On September 17, 1986, the City Council approved the idea on a 10-2 vote,Richard Simon, \\"Council Approves North Hollywood High-Density Limits,\\" Los Angeles Times, September 18, 1986 but less than a month later it reversed itself after heavy lobbying – by former Councilman Arthur K. Snyder, among others – and sent the ordinance back to committee, with the idea that it could be brought back with exemptions for areas where development had already occurred. Finally, substantially the same measure was approved by the council on a temporary basis with exemptions for two dozen properties in areas where there had already been substantial development, like the south side of Riverside Drive between Colfax Avenue and Laurel Canyon Boulevard.Richard Simon, \\"Council Enacts Building Limits on High-Rises in Valley Village,\\" Los Angeles Times, November 19, 1986 Eventually, the Los Angeles city Planning Commission recommended that a three-story limit be adopted for the Valley Village area.Tracey Kaplan, \\"L.A.

In 2006, Valley Village was described in another article as a neighborhood \\"mostly of 1,700 sqft, single-story Spanish- and ranch-style homes that typically sit on nice-size lots.\\" Most of the 3,881 single-family homes were on residential streets, and 1,073 condos and 8,213 apartment units lined the main boulevards.Diane Wedner, \\"Village Locals Say It's a Slice of the Sweet Life,\\" Los Angeles Times, January 29, 2006 Population A total of 24,190 people lived in Valley Village's 2.09 square miles, according to the 2000 U.S. census – averaging 11,600 people per square mile, about average for Los Angeles.

Marilyn Monroe house Marilyn Monroe while living in Valley Village, 1945 A house at 5258 Hermitage Avenue Location of Marilyn Monroe house on Mapping L.A. where film actress Marilyn Monroe lived in 1944-45 under her married name of Norma Jean Dougherty, was demolished by a property developer to make way for a condominium project in June 2015 even as it was under consideration as a historic landmark. She lived there at age 17 while her husband, James Dougherty, was in the Navy, and she had a job inspecting parachutes at a nearby factory. She was living there when she was asked to pose for her first pin-up photo.

The group said it also had \\"overwhelming evidence\\" that an environmental report should have been prepared for the condo project. The group also asked that the city nullify any development projects that received unanimous support during the previous twelve months.

It is located on the West Bank of the Nile at Thebes, Upper Egypt, in the desert to the south of Medinet Habu. The site also included a temple dedicated to Amenhotep III's Great Royal Wife, Tiy, which honors Sobek, the crocodile deity. The ruins of the Ancient Egyptian palace, Malkata; north is at the top. Palace of Amenhotep III Polychrome glass vase from Malkata. Walters Art Museum. The city had an extensive glass industry, the first in Egypt There are various structures in the desert, consisting of several residential palaces, a temple of Amun, a festival hall, elite villas, houses for the relatives of the royal family, apartments for attendants, and a desert altar termed the Kom al-Samak, all of which were constructed of mud bricks. The palace was built in the 14th century BC and its ancient name was Per-Hay, \\"House of Rejoicing\\". Originally, the palace was known as the Palace of the Dazzling Aten. Built mostly out of mud- brick, it was Amenhotep's residence throughout most of the later part of his reign. Construction began around year 11 of his reign and continued until the king moved there permanently around his year 29. Once completed, it was the largest royal residence in Egypt. To the east of the palace a large ceremonial lake was dug. The palace area was connected to the Nile through a system of canals, which end in a large harbour or quay, now called Birket Habu. =Layout of the palace= Painted bench end-panel at Malkata depicting a fruit bowl. In the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art The palace contained many audience halls, central halls, courtyards, villas, smaller palace complexes for the royal family, and apartments for officials. The harbor and canal connected the palace with the Nile, allowing easy travel across the river to the city of Thebes, which was situated on the eastern bank. There is little evidence of this lake today and little but the foundations of the palace itself remain. The royal apartment featured a bedroom, a dressing room, a private audience chamber, and a harem, which, after the reign of Amenhotep III, was used simply for storage. The palace had a central courtyard, and across from the pharaoh's rooms were apartments for his daughters and son. His Great Royal Wife, Tiye, had her own smaller palace complex diagonally across from the pharaoh's. The palace grounds contained gardens and a large pleasure lake. Remains exist of a temple of Amun to the north of the palace, within the complex. A \\"desert altar\\" on the outskirts of the ruins has also been excavated. Remains of a temple to the goddess Isis lie south of the main palace complex. Malqata was managed by a veritable army of servants and staff. Remains of kitchens near the royal chamber have been found, as well as servant quarters. The palace resembled a complete city, with officials in charge of different sections, such as the gardens and the different apartments and quarters. =Palace decorations= Traces of wall painting on plastered mudbrick wall at Malkata Fragments of plastered wall paintings have given archaeologists a glimpse of how the palace was decorated. Various paintings of the goddess Nekhbet made up the ceiling of the royal bedchamber. The walls were decorated with scenes of wildlife - flowers, reeds, and animals in the marshes, as well as decorative geometric designs, complete with rosettes. Ornate wooden columns painted to resemble lilies supported the ceilings. In the palace archaeologists also found some paintings of the great royal wife, Tiye. Rare traces of original wall paintings are still visible on site, despite the badly ruined state of the mudbrick walls. =History of the palace= The palace seems to have been begun by Amenhotep III in the early 14th century BC and the site was occupied as late as the Roman-Byzantine Period. Malqata was most definitely Amenhotep's main residence near Thebes, the capital of ancient Egypt, and therefore, probably his main palace in all of the country. Remains of other smaller palaces in Thebes and other cities throughout Egypt have been found, but none were as large as Amenhotep's palace at Malqata. Malqata was abandoned by Akhenaten, Amenhotep III's son and successor when he moved the capital to his new city at Amarna, perhaps in order to break the influence of the powerful priests of the Temple of Amun. However, it may have been re-inhabited by the youthful Tutankhamen, when the traditional religion and capital were restored and the priests of the temple regained their influence in the interwoven religion and government of Ancient Egypt. Tutankhamen's successor, Ay, probably inhabited the palace briefly, and pharaoh Horemheb after him as well, but by the ascension of Ramesses II, it was simply a minor residence, as the capital was moved to Pi-Ramesses in the far north. =Excavations= The palace ruins were \\"rediscovered\\" several times: in 1888 by Daressy; by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1910–1920; by University Museum of Pennsylvania in the 1970s; and since 1985, they have been the site of excavations by the Archaeological Mission of Waseda University. Deir el-Shelwit=Temple of Isis= Just south of the palace there is a temple devoted to Isis which was built in the Roman period. The modern name for this temple is Deir al-Shalwi. =Roman settlement and cemetery= Excavations of the area by the Waseda team unearthed the remains of a Roman settlement and cemetery, finding remains from the times of Trajan and Hadrian. Malkata today Next to the site is a modern village. Here there is a tiny church and monastery dedicated to St Tawdros. See also * Malqata Menat References * Fletcher, J.

He wrote several books, among which Psycho-Cybernetics was a long-time bestseller — influencing many subsequent self-help teachers. His orientation towards a system of ideas that would provide self-help is considered the forerunner of the now popular self-help books. Life and career Maxwell \\"Max\\" Maltz was born March 10, 1899, in Manhattan's Lower East Side, the third child of Josef Maltz and Taube Elzweig, both Jewish immigrants from what was then known as the town of Resche in the Austro- Hungarian Empire (today Rzeszów, Poland). In 1923, Maltz graduated with a doctorate in medicine from the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. He also undertook training under German plastic surgeons who were considered most advanced in cosmetic surgery at that time. In 1960, Psycho- Cybernetics: A New Way to Get More Living out of Life was first published by Prentice-Hall and appeared in a pocket book edition by 1969. The book introduced Maltz's views that people must have an accurate and positive view of themselves before setting goals; otherwise they will get stuck in a continuing pattern of limiting beliefs. His ideas focus on visualizing one's goals and he believed that self-image is the cornerstone of all the changes that take place in a person. According to Maltz, if one's self-image is unhealthy or faulty — all of a person's efforts will end in failure. Maltz also wrote fiction, including a play called Unseen Scar (1946) and a novel, The Time is Now (1975). His autobiography, Doctor Pygmalion: The Autobiography of a Plastic Surgeon (1953), was popular and influential, being discussed in many subsequent books on body and identity. It was re-titled Doctor Psycho- Cybernetics after his self-help work was published. Although the book Psycho- Cybernetics was first published in 1960, as of 2008 the book is one of 50 recommended in the book 50 Self-Help Classics.

Neigong practice is normally associated with the so-called \\"soft style\\", \\"internal\\" or neijia Chinese martial arts, as opposed to the category known as waigong or \\"external skill\\" which is historically associated with shaolinquan or the so-called \\"hard style\\", \\"external\\" or wàijiā Chinese martial arts. Both have many different schools, disciplines and practices and historically there has been mutual influence between the two and distinguishing precisely between them differs from school to school. There is both martial and non-martial neigong. Well known examples of martial neigong are the various breathing and focus trainings taught in some traditional Taijiquan, Baguazhang Xingyiquan and Liuhebafa schools. An example of non-martial neigong is the discipline known as Daoyin. Neigong and the internal martial arts The Neijing Tu () is a Daoist \\"inner landscape\\" diagram of the human body illustrating Neidan \\"Internal alchemy\\", Wu Xing, Yin and Yang, and Chinese mythology. The martial art school of neigong emphasises training the coordination of the individual's body with the breath, known as the harmonisation of the inner and outer energy (), creating a basis for a particular school's method of utilising power and technique. Neigong exercises that are part of the neijia tradition involve cultivating physical stillness and or conscious (deliberate) movement, designed to produce relaxation or releasing of muscular tension combined with special breathing techniques such as the \\"tortoise\\" or \\"reverse\\" methods. The fundamental purpose of this process is to develop a high level of coordination, concentration and technical skill that is known in the martial arts world as neijin (). The ultimate purpose of this practice is for the individual to become at one with heaven or the Dao (). As Zhuangzi stated, \\"Heaven, earth and I are born of one, and I am at one with all that exists ()\\". Martial Nei Gung is about developing internal power. One way to possibly achieve this is to train particular exercises regularly where the breath is matched with movements of blood or to effect the movement of blood throughout the body. Through these exercises it can be possible to move the blood to a particular area during a particular movement to have a particular result. One of the benefits of martial nei gung exercises is the relaxation of blood vessels, nerves, muscles and sinews to help the body move more freely. With the body moving freely and an excess of blood moving to a particular area with little or no effort, the practitioner can possibly develop many benefits. These benefits may include: * faster recovery from injury to the hands * an ability to hit with more force * an ability to move faster (speed is crucial in martial arts) * the health benefits of being relaxed * an increase in connection to your legs, spine, arms and head * increased stamina * increased athletic ability and health * regulation of blood pressure * actually experiencing the channels of the body as they truly are, which can possibly be different from the books * developing an authentic dan tien that is consciously nourished and deliberately formed which is not defined in the books * greater sensitivity for sparring and fighting It is important to understand that anyone looking to learn Nei Gung sincerely, is more likely to learn it from a good teacher of internal martial arts like Hsing-Yi (one of the easiest and most powerful forms of martial cultivation). It is rare to learn authentic Daoist practices from a true master of the subject as quite a lot of the Nei Gung skills are an essential part of a complete system of martial arts. Nei Gung is not a philosophy, but a technique and an art of inner cultivation. There are intellectual guidelines to the practice of Nei Gung, but it is 'Inner Work' which means effort has to be put in to develop real, substantial and testable skills. This is not something that can be imagined or talked about, only from direct experience and hard effort can an understanding of Nei Gung develop. A true practitioner and teacher will take you on a journey growing your inner-world and showing you how to demonstrate the skills you are developing. Neigong and meditation This type of practice is said to require concentration and internal reflection which results in a heightened self-awareness that increases over time with continued practice. Neigong practitioners report awareness of the mechanics of their blood circulation, peristalsis, muscular movement, skeletal alignment, balance, etc. What is said to be occurring as the result of continual practice is a type of internal alchemy, that is a refinement and transmutation of the \\"Three Treasures\\" or San Bao (), in Chinese. The Three Treasures are known as Jing (), Qi () and Shen () and can be loosely translated as Essence, Vitality and Spirit. According to Daoist doctrine the Three Treasures can be described as three types of energy available to humans. The Dao De Jing purported to be written by Lao zi states in chapter 42 that \\"The Dao () gives birth to the One, the One gives birth to the Two (Taiji () or Yin and Yang ()) and the Two gives birth to the Three (which some interpret to mean Jing , Qi and Shen , or sometimes Heaven Tian , Earth Di and Man Ren ) and Three gives birth to the Four direction's, North, South, East, and West and so on to the 10,000 Things (Wanwu ); which is all that exists between heaven and earth. Neigong training follows therefore the classical Daoist developmental stages and regards the first two stages as a preparation for the last and final stage:Damo Mitchell: Daoist Nei Gong - The Philosophical Art of Change, Singing Dragon, 2011, , page 19 Physical body (Jing) -> Energy body (Qi) -> Divine Consciousness (Shen) See also * Dantian * I Ching * Qigong * Silk reeling *Tao Yin * Traditional Chinese medicine * Zhan zhuang * Zhang Sanfeng ReferencesFurther reading *Blofeld, J.

The 1975 convention replaced the TIR Convention of 1959, which itself replaced the 1949 TIR Agreement between a number of European countries. The conventions were adopted under the auspices of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE). As of December 2018, there are 76 parties to the Convention, including 75 states and the European Union. The TIR Convention establishes an international customs transit system with maximum facility to move goods: * in sealed vehicles or containers; * from a customs office of departure in one country to a customs office of destination in another country; * without requiring extensive and time-consuming border checks at intermediate borders; * while, at the same time, providing customs authorities with the required security and guarantees. The TIR system not only covers customs transit by road but a combination is possible with other modes of transport (e.g., rail, inland waterway, and even maritime transport), as long as at least one part of the total transport is made by road. To date, more than 33,000 international transport operators had been authorised (by their respective competent national authorities) to access the TIR system, using around 1.5 million TIR carnets per year. In light of the expected increase in world trade, further enlargement of its geographical scope and the forthcoming introduction of an electronic TIR system (so-called \\"eTIR-system\\"), it is expected that the TIR system will continue to remain the only truly global customs transit system. Due to the large blue-and-white TIR plates carried by vehicles using the TIR convention, the word \\"TIR\\" entered many languages, such as Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian or Turkish, as a neologism, becoming the default generic name of a large lorry. Saudi Arabia acceded to the convention on 17 May 2018, and the convention entered into force for Saudi Arabia on 17 November 2018. With the accession of Saudi Arabia, the TIR Convention had seventy-four Contracting Parties.  TIR procedures  Lorriers making use of the TIR procedure must first obtain an internationally harmonised customs document, referred to as a TIR carnet. TIR carnets are issued by national road transport associations. This customs document is valid internationally and as well as describing the goods, their shipper and their destination, represents a financial guarantee. When a lorry arrives at a border customs post it need not pay import duties and taxes on goods at that time. Instead the payments are suspended. If the vehicle transits the country without delivering any goods, no taxes are due. If it fails to leave the country with all the goods, then the taxes are billed to the importer and the financial guarantee backstops the importer's obligation to pay the taxes. TIR transits are carried out in bond, i.e. the lorry must be sealed as well as bearing the carnet. The security payment system is administered by the International Road Transport Union (IRU). The TIR procedure is mostly used with Eastern European countries that are not in the EU (e.g. Russia and Ukraine), Turkey, and parts of the Near East. Since the formation of the European single market, the TIR procedure has become unnecessary for intra-EU goods transport. As a result of Brexit, TIR carnets could become part of the solution to merchandise traffic between Great Britain and other European countries, or for goods to transit intra-EU, for example between Ireland and mainland Europe.

During the reign of Mahmud II, when the military and imperial band were re- organized along Western lines, Giuseppe Donizetti was invited to head the process. Donizetti Pasha, as he was known in the Ottoman Empire, composed the first Western-style imperial anthem, the Mahmudiye Marşı. Like in many other monarchies of its time, the anthem of the Ottoman Empire was an imperial anthem, not a national one. Hence it paid homage to a specific ruler and a new anthem was composed at each imperial succession. However, in 1844, with the Tanzimat reforms, the Mecidiye Marşı was recognized as the first official Ottoman national anthem. The first official Ottoman national flag (which was in essence identical to the present-day Turkish flag) was also adopted in 1844.

Plot When Spike returns from his mission with Andrew, he is enraged to find that the Scooby Gang have lost faith in Buffy's leadership, during his absence, and have evicted her from her home. He denounces them all as traitors, then storms out in disgust to find Buffy after exchanging a few blows with Faith. Spike tracks down and comforts a depressed Buffy, while Faith accepts her role as the newly elected leader of the Potentials. The Scoobies capture a Bringer and magically interrogate him. Eyeless and tongueless, he speaks through Andrew, who tells them that Bringers are busy forging weapons for the coming apocalypse and do not see Buffy's army as a threat. Later, after saying goodnight to Giles, Faith is approached by The First (in the form of Richard Wilkins), who leads her to believe that Buffy only sees her as a killer and will take the first chance she gets to kill her. That evening, four couples engage in intimacy. Buffy and Spike take refuge in an abandoned house, and Buffy confesses her self-doubt and inability to let anyone become close to her. Spike tries to rally her spirits by describing that he's seen all of her, the good and the bad, but he still stands by her. Buffy asks Spike to spend the night. Initially misunderstanding her meaning, he moves toward a large chair, but Buffy requests he spend the night holding her. Faith and Wood engage in a one-night stand.

She appeared in 51 episodes (48 episodes of Law & Order, one episode of Law & Order: Criminal Intent and two episodes of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit). Her character was particularly notable for the fact that she was the first woman in the program's history to hold the position of New York County District Attorney (no woman has held the position in real life). Pursuant to New York law, an interim District Attorney is appointed by the Governor. Role within Law & Order Prior to her appointment as interim DA, Lewin was a law professor, which often provoked her critics to dismiss her as a detached academic with no practical experience. Lewin's term as DA is defined by a liberally directed program of legal application to many notable criminal cases, which often brings her into political and legal dilemmas. While she is an idealist, however, she is not prepared to subvert the correct application of the law due to her personal beliefs. In a 2001 episode, she is confronted with the decision to pursue the death penalty in a conviction of an 18-year- old murderer. While she personally opposes the death penalty, she realizes that her office would be seen as soft on crime, and reluctantly succumbs to political pressure. The young man is found guilty and sent to death row. Lewin works closely with Jack McCoy (Sam Waterston) and Abbie Carmichael (Angie Harmon). Her political beliefs often put her into conflict with both of them, especially the latter, a staunch political conservative. After Carmichael leaves the DA's office, Lewin replaces her with Serena Southerlyn (Elisabeth Röhm), whose liberal idealism more closely resembles her own political philosophy. She has a niece, indicating that she has at least one sibling. Departure In September 2002, after two years of her term as District Attorney, Lewin departs the office. The manner in which she departed the show is never specified on screen. However, in his tie-in book Law & Order: Crime Scenes, Dick Wolf wrote that his intention for the character was that Lewin found herself disenchanted with the position of D.A., and opted not to run for election following her interim term. Fred Dalton Thompson subsequently joined the cast as Republican Arthur Branch. Wiest later stated, in the book Actors at Work, written jointly by Rosemarie Tichler and Barry Jay Kaplan, that she was tired of the role and wished to move on to other projects. In her first scene, Lewin is introduced to McCoy by Mayor Rudy Giuliani (playing himself in a cameo appearance), who praises Lewin's record and assures her that she will do a fine job as District Attorney.

Cony draws its students from Augusta, as well as the surrounding communities of Chelsea, China, Jefferson, Palermo, Somerville, Vassalboro, Whitefield, and Windsor. The school's origins are in the Cony Female Academy, which was founded in 1816 by Daniel Cony to provide free education to orphans and other girls under the age of 16. The school later expanded into a co-ed high school. In the fall of 2006, the city of Augusta opened a new Cony High School adjacent to the Capital Area Technical Center on Pierce Drive. Three years later, it was consolidated with local middle schools, and currently serves grades 7-12. The new building is architecturally linked to the design of the Old Cony High School building which featured a wedge-shaped flatiron design. The flatiron building has been preserved as a building of historical significance and is in the National Register of Historical Places in Maine. As of 2018–19 enrollment for Cony High is approximately 680 students. Academics and rankings In the 2020 US News & World Report (based on results for the 2017–2018 academic year), Cony High School was ranked between 47 and 83 among ranked high schools in the state and between 13,345 and 17,792 of ranked schools nationally.

Borders on the Upper Silesian Metropolitan Union – metropolis with the population of 2 million. It is located in the Silesian Highlands. The population of the town is 9,175 (2019). Geography The municipality is situated a short distance to the south-west of Junction 41 on the A4 Highway. It has been in the Silesian Voivodeship since its formation in 1999, previously having been in the Katowice Voivodeship, and before that, in the Autonomous Silesian Voivodeship. Imielin is one of the towns included in the 2.7 million conurbation – Katowice urban area and within a greater Silesian metropolitan area populated by about 5,294,000 people.European Spatial Planning Observation Network (ESPON) Economy The area is both industrial and agricultural. There are dolomite deposits and, beneath the flatter area to the south-west of the municipality, coal deposits. History=Late Medieval= The earliest mention in the records of Imielin dates from 1386. At that time it was part of the Duchy of Racibórz (Ratibor), the eastern border of which was marked by the Przemsza River. Imielin, like the neighbouring villages of Kosztowy and Chełm Śląski was nevertheless isolated from the rest of the duchy by the dense forest which were a feature of the area formed by the sources and headwaters of the Kłodnica and Mleczna rivers. For this reason in 1391 the Duke of Opava- Ratibor gifted this eastern portion of his lands to the Bishop of Kraków. From then until 1742 these villages were no longer part of the political entity of Silesia, control over them instead being exercised by the bishops of Kraków. =Early Modern and Nineteenth century= Following the annexation of Silesia to Prussia by Frederick the Great, sovereignty over the villages was removed from the bishops of Kraków in 1772, and in 1796 administrative control and ownership of the land was also transferred to the Prussian crown. In 1802 Alt Gatsch (Stara Gać) was established as a daughter settlement, followed in 1820 by Neu Gatsch (Nova/New Gać). During the period of pan-European warfare with which the nineteenth century opened, the Napoleonic general Jean Lannes, who had been appointed Prince of Severia by the Duchy of Warsaw, asserted control over Imielin, along with Severia, citing in support the fact that historically both had belonged to the Bishopric of Kraków. Following the end of the Napoleonic War, Imielin was in 1817 returned to Prussia, and in 1818 it was incorporated into the newly created Pleß administrative district. =Twentieth century= Imielin's excellent transport links to the industrial cities of Katowice, Oświęcim and Tychy enabled it to grow considerably during the twentieth century, both as a residential town for commuters to these larger centres and on account of businesses establishing themselves in Imielin itself. The official population count increased from 2,614 in 1900 to 5,200 in 1931, and to 7,757 in 1970. =Massacre during Second World War= During the German Invasion of Poland in 1939, German soldiers mass murdered 28 Poles on the night of 4 and 5 September. The victims included refugees, 3 women and one 5-year old child.Szymon Datner \\"55 dni Wehrmachtu w Polsce\\" page 187 Sights A noteworthy building is Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church, a gothic revival building constructed between 1909 and 1912, and subsequently enlarged in 1953: in 1957 the height of the tower was increased to 27 meters.

MSDN Magazine named it as one of the Ten Must-Have utilities for developers, and Scott Hanselman listed it as part of his \\"Big Ten Life and Work-Changing Utilities\\".  Overview  .NET Reflector was the first CLI assembly browser. It can be used to inspect, navigate, search, analyze, and browse the contents of a CLI component such as an assembly and translates the binary information to a human-readable form. By default Reflector allows decompilation of CLI assemblies into C#, Visual Basic .NET, C++/CLI and Common Intermediate Language and F# (alpha version). Reflector also includes a \\"Call Tree\\" that can be used to drill down into intermediate language methods to see what other methods they call. It will show the metadata, resources and XML documentation. .NET Reflector can be used by .NET developers to understand the inner workings of code libraries, to show the differences between two versions of the same assembly, and how the various parts of a CLI application interact with each other. There are a large number of add-ins for Reflector. .NET Reflector can be used to track down performance problems and bugs, browse classes, and maintain or help become familiar with code bases. It can also be used to find assembly dependencies, and even windows DLL dependencies, by using the Analyzer option. There is a call tree and inheritance-browser. It will pick up the same documentation or comments that are stored in xml files alongside their associated assemblies that are used to drive IntelliSense inside Visual Studio. It is even possible to cross-navigate related documentation (\`xmldoc\`), searching for specific types, members and references. It can be used to effectively convert source code between C# and Visual Basic. .NET Reflector has been designed to host add-ins to extend its functionality, many of which are open source. Some of these add-ins provide other languages that can be disassembled too, such as PowerShell, Delphi and MC++. Others analyze assemblies in different ways, providing quality metrics, sequence diagrams, class diagrams, dependency structure matrices or dependency graphs. It is possible to use add-ins to search text, save disassembled code to disk, export an assembly to XMI/UML, compare different versions, or to search code. Other add-ins allow debugging processes. Some add-ins are designed to facilitate testing by creating stubs and wrappers. History .NET Reflector was originally developed by Lutz Roeder as freeware. Its first versions can be tracked back to January 2001. On 20 August 2008, Red Gate Software announced they were taking responsibility for future development of the software. In February 2010 Red Gate released .NET Reflector 6 along with a commercial Pro edition that enabled users to step into decompiled code in the Visual Studio debugger as if it were their own source code. On 10 January 2011 Red Gate announced that .NET Reflector 7 would incorporate Jason Haley's PowerCommands add-in. On 1 February 2011 Red Gate announced that .NET Reflector would become a commercial product as of version 7, which was released on 14 March 2011.

Pierre Victor, baron de Besenval de Brünstatt (1721–1791) was the last commander of the Swiss Guards in France. Born at Solothurn, he was the son of Jean Victor de Besenval, colonel of the regiment of Swiss Guards in the pay of France, who was charged in 1707 by Louis XIV with a mission to Sweden to reconcile Charles XII with the tsar Peter the Great, and to unite them in alliance with France against England. Pierre Victor served at first as aide-de-camp to Marshall Broglie during the campaign of 1748 in Bohemia, then as aide-de-camp to the duke of Orleans during the Seven Years' War. He then became commander of the Swiss Guards. When the French Revolution began de Besenval remained firmly attached to the royal court and he was given command of the troops which the king had concentrated in Paris in July 1789, a move which led to the storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789. Besenval showed incompetence in the crisis, and attempted to flee. He was arrested, tried by the tribunal of the Châtelet, but acquitted. He then fell into obscurity and died in Paris in 1791. The baron de Besenval de Brünstatt is principally known as the author of his Mémoires, which were published in 1805 to 1807 by the vicomte de Ségur, who was said to be his actual son, in which are reported many scandalous tales, true or false, of the court of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. The authenticity of these memoirs is not absolutely established.

He served in the United States Navy (in which he was a bantamweight boxing champion), and led several field explorations of the U.S. Geological Survey. In academia, he was a member of the faculty of Harvard University, University of Minnesota, University of California, Los Angeles, and lastly University of California, Santa Barbara. He was best known for his work on the geologic time scale and the origin of life on Earth, and as a pioneering ecologist and environmentalist. He was credited with coining the term \\"biogeology.\\" His works on the significance of Cambrian fossils in the 1940s led to the development of the concept \\"Cambrian explosion,\\" for which he coined the phrase \\"eruptive evolution.\\"  Early life and education  Cloud was born in West Upton, Massachusetts. He was the third of seven children of Preston Ercelle and Pauline L. (née Wiedemann) Cloud. His father was an engineer-draftsman, and his mother, a genealogist. He grew up in Waynesboro, Pennsylvania where he developed a love for the outdoors. He enjoyed Scouting and was an Eagle Scout. Upon graduating from Waynesboro High School in 1929, Cloud spent three years in the United States Navy (1930–1933) where he excelled at boxing. He was the bantamweight champion of the Pacific Fleet Scouting Force. Due to the Great Depression, he could not join university, and attended night school at George Washington University, so that he could self- support by doing odd jobs during daytime. Ray S. Bassler, his geology professor and Curator of Geology at the U.S. National Museum, helped him to get manual jobs in the museum. Because of his keen interest in paleontology, he was given a job as a preparator in the paleontology laboratory under G. Arthur Cooper. It was Cooper who guided him to have his first technical publication on Devonian brachiopods from Illinois in 1938. In 1937 he earned his BSc degree, and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. He enrolled for PhD at Yale University graduate school in geology the same year. Working on the major systematic monograph on a group of Paleozoic brachiopods, under the supervision of C. O. Dunbar, he received his doctorate in 1940. His thesis directly earned him the A. Cressey Morrison Prize in Natural History of the New York Academy of Sciences, and was published by the Geological Society of America as Special Paper 38 in 1942.  Professional career  In the summer of 1939, Cloud worked as field assistant to A. Lincoln Washburn on Victoria Island in western Arctic Canada. For the rest of the year he taught at the Missouri School of Mines in Rolla. During 1941 to 1942 he returned to Yale University to continue work on brachiopod evolution as a Sterling Research Fellow. At the height of World War II, he was recruited to the United States Geological Survey to work on the wartime Strategic Minerals Program. He embarked on a field party to investigate manganese deposits in Maine during the summer of 1941. In 1943, he joined Virgil Barnes of the Texas Bureau of Economic Geology in the Ellenburger Project, studying the stratigraphy and sedimentology of this important early Paleozoic carbonate complex. He became chief of party for bauxite investigations in Alabama. After the war, in 1946, Cloud was appointed as Assistant Professor of Paleontology and Curator of Invertebrate Paleontology at Harvard University. In 1948 he returned to the U.S. Geological Survey to become chief of the Branch of Paleontology and Stratigraphy. He was chief of party to map and investigate the geology of Saipan in the Mariana Islands in the western Pacific. He became Chief Paleontologist from 1949 to 1959. In 1961 he was appointed as Chairman of the Department of Geology and Geophysics at the University of Minnesota. He established the School of Earth Sciences at that university, becoming its first Head. In 1965 he moved to the University of California, Los Angeles, as Professor of Biogeology, jointly with the Institute of Geophysics and the Department of Geology. In 1968 he transferred to the University of California, Santa Barbara campus, as full Professor. At UCSB he founded the Preston Cloud Research Laboratory, originally dedicated to paleomicrobiology and to studies of the first lunar geological samples from the Apollo 11 space mission. In addition, between 1974 and 1979 he was again a member of the U.S. Geological Survey based in Santa Barbara. He retired in 1974, but continued as Professor Emeritus. He spent the rest of his life at UCSB.  Achievements and recognitions  Cloud was a member of the National Academy of Sciences for thirty years, he was chairman of the Geology Section and occupied positions in its Council and Executive Committee. In 1967-69 he headed the Academy's \\"Committee on Resources and Man,\\" whose alarming report \\"Resources and Man\\" introduced to a wider public, among other things, the work on energy-resources of his friend M. King Hubbert, and the Hubbert peak theory of Peak oil production. He also gave the Hadean geologic eon, Earth's earliest, its name, using the Greek word for the Underworld to refer to a molten state of constant heat. Cloud was the author of over 200 scientific and lay publications. Notably, his 1978 book, Cosmos, Earth, and Man: A Short History of the Universe, written for a general readership, has been called 'one of the first and finest presentations of \\"a more ample and more coherent picture of the world\\"' (Alles), and his 1988 Oasis in Space: Earth History from the Beginning a \\"comprehensive work of synthesis and reflection... a documented history of the earth and life on it... and an impressive capstone to his remarkable scholarship\\" (Crowell). One of Cloud's scientific heirs, his nephew John P. Grotzinger, is the Project Scientist for the NASA Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover Mission Team. In 1990 special volume titled “Proterozoic Evolution and Environments” was published in the American Journal of Science in honour of Cloud's works. University of California, Santa Barbara has a graduate student award named Preston Cloud Memorial Awards, which is given annually and carries minimum $200 for first-time attendance at a national or major meeting of a professional organization such as the Geological Society of America, American Geophysical Union, Association of American Petroleum Geologists, or for a student presenting a talk at such a meeting for the first time. = Cambrian Explosion = Preston Cloud was the first scientist to systematically recognise the importance of the rich fossils of the Cambrian rocks in evolutionary terms. In order to explain the somewhat sudden appearance of diverse animals during the Cambrian Period, he invented the term \\"eruptive radiation\\" in his 1948 paper. According to him, the earlier use of the term like \\"explosive\\" was misleading because the actual evolution could occur over a period of millions of years, and it \\"probably did not make a loud noise,\\" he described, as implicated by the term. He postulated that adaptive radiation in any favourable ecological condition could always result in diversification of an original population into several distinct lineages, thus giving rise to eruptive evolution. Although his innovative thinking was largely ignored at the time, extensive research on the Cambrian fauna since the late 1970s, such as the fossils of the Burgess Shale, has established that the bio-geological event is a true documentation of the evolutionary origins of the animals, especially the body plans of modern animals.  Personal life  Cloud was a noted public speaker and symposium participant on the subjects of resources, the human future, origin of life and the primitive earth, and he regularly delivered many popular lectures. Cloud was of small stature, and with a rather Asian-like complexion. During his service in World War II, as D. L. Peck, Director of the U.S. Geological Survey, noted in a letter dated January 29, 1941: \\"[Preston Cloud] created quite a stir among the locals who suspected that this person of slight stature, emerging from holes in the ground, must certainly be a Japanese spy in their midst.” At 5'6\\", he would often put his desk and chairs on 4-inch-high raisers so that, as he claimed, he could look down on others to show his authority. Cloud was an ardent humanist. In graduate school, Preston was engaged to Mildred Porter. When Preston resigned from Harvard, they were divorced. In his time at Washington, he married Frances Webster, with whom he had three children, Karen, Lisa, and Kevin. The family moved to Minnesota in 1961, and though Preston and Frances were amicably divorced in 1965, two years later Preston relocated the entire family to Santa Barbara, California when he accepted a professorship at the University of California, Santa Barbara. In Santa Barbara, Preston met and, in 1973, married Janice Gibson, an opera singer and mother of three children, Morgan, Dante, and Amanda. Preston and Janis remained together for the remainder of his life. Preston Cloud died at home, on January 16, 1991, of pneumonia, brought on as a complication of Lou Gehrig's disease.

Cayetano, 528 U.S. 495 (2000), was a case filed in 1996 by Big Island rancher Harold \\"Freddy\\" Rice against the state of Hawaii and argued before the United States Supreme Court. In 2000, the Court ruled that the state could not restrict eligibility to vote in elections for the Board of Trustees of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs to persons of Native Hawaiian descent.. Rice was represented by attorney John Goemans. John Roberts (who would later become the Chief Justice of the United States) argued for Ben Cayetano, the governor of Hawaii at the time. The February 2000 court ruling in Rice v. Cayetano encouraged Hawaiian sovereignty opponents to file a similar lawsuit, Arakaki v. State of Hawai‘i, months later. As the Rice case resulted in non-Hawaiians being allowed to vote in OHA elections, the Arakaki case resulted in non- Hawaiians being allowed to stand as candidates in OHA elections.  Background  Beginning in 1978, Hawaii held statewide elections for the trustees of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA), an agency charged with disbursing particular funds and benefits to those who may be classified as \\"Native Hawaiians\\" (\\"any descendant of not less than one-half part of the races inhabiting the Hawaiian Islands previous to 1778\\"), or those who may be classified simply as \\"Hawaiian\\" (\\"any descendant[s] of the aboriginal peoples inhabiting the Hawaiian islands ... in 1778, and which peoples thereafter have continued to reside in Hawaii\\"). By law, only Native Hawaiians or Hawaiians could vote for, or be elected to, this Board of Trustees. Harold F. Rice was a rancher of European descent whose family had resided in Hawaii since the mid-19th century. In March 1996, he attempted to register to vote for the OHA trustees. Where that application asked for confirmation that \\"I am also Hawaiian and desire to register to vote in OHA elections,\\" Rice scratched out the words \\"am also Hawaiian and\\" and checked \\"Yes.\\" Denied eligibility because he was not Hawaiian, Rice sued under the 14th and 15th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. The District Court for the State of Hawaii ruled against Rice, due to its conclusion (as summarized by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals) that \\"the method of electing OHA trustees meets constitutional standards for the essential reason that the restriction on the right to vote is not based on race, but upon recognition of the unique status of native Hawaiians that bears a rational connection to Hawaii's trust obligations.\\" The District Court held that the OHA does not sufficiently resemble a typical government bureau, with governmental powers, and that it is \\"carefully constrained by its overall purpose to work for the betterment of Hawaiians.\\" The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals also denied Rice's claim. For one thing, Rice contended that the legal status of an eligible voter is contingent solely upon race, and that Hawaii's contention that such status is a political designation, rather than a racial one, is an obvious effort to circumvent the Constitution with semantics. The Court of Appeals agreed that it might indeed be the case that the political designation is a racial designation under the state's statute, yet \\"the constitutionality of the racial classification that underlies the trusts and OHA is not challenged in this case. This means that we must accept the trust and their administrative structure as we find them, and assume that both are lawful.\\" Because Rice had not challenged the OHA's very existence, which is predicated on a racial classification, the Court could assume that \\"the state may rationally conclude that Hawaiians, being the group to whom trust obligations run and to whom OHA trustees owe a duty of loyalty, should be the group to decide who the trustees ought to be.\\" Thus, despite an apparent racial classification for eligibility to vote, within the context of the OHA's creation and mandate, the classification is actually \\"not primarily racial, but legal or political.\\" Furthermore, the Court of Appeals decided that the OHA trustee election was a \\"special purpose election\\" such as that upheld in Salyer Land Co. v. Tulare Water District (1973). In that case, the election for directors of a certain \\"special purpose water district\\" was limited to landowners in that district. The weight of a landowners vote was proportional to the amount of land that was owned, and thus seemed to contradict the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection clause. The Court held that because these landowners were disproportionately affected by the policies of the water district directors, and that such directors existed for a \\"limited purpose\\" and exhibited a \\"lack of normal governmental authority,\\" the districts did not violate the Constitution when they denied a vote to those who did not own land in the district, and granted votes proportionally to the amount of land owned. The elections for the OHA Board of Trustees is similar to that of the water district directors, in that \\"the vote is for the limited purpose of electing trustees who have no governmental powers and perform no governmental purposes.\\" Also, because Hawaiians, as defined by statute, are those disproportionately affected by the OHA, the vote for its trustees may be limited to them. Thus this exception to the 14th Amendment was used to justify the Hawaiian voting scheme under objections based on the 15th Amendment. Finally, the Court of Appeals concluded that \\"the voting restriction for trustees is rooted in historical concern for the Hawaiian race ... carried through statehood when Hawaii acknowledged a trust obligation toward native Hawaiians ... and on to 1993, when Congress passed a Joint Resolution 'apologiz[ing] to Native Hawaiians on behalf of the people of the United States for the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii ... and the deprivation of the rights of Native Hawaiians to self-determination'.\\" Thus the 9th circuit held that native Hawaiians were entitled to \\"special treatment\\" much like the special treatment accorded Native American Indians in Morton v. Mancari, where \\"preferential treatment that is grounded in the government's unique obligation toward Indians is a political rather than a racial classification, even though racial criteria may be used in defining eligibility.\\" Rice appealed to the Supreme Court. There, he would argue that in addition to being a naked violation of the Constitution on its face, the eligibility requirements subverted the original intended purpose of the public lands as written in the Annexation and Organic Acts, both of which granted subsequent benefits to all \\"inhabitants\\" of Hawaii, regardless of race. The elections do not qualify as \\"special purpose\\" under Salyer, nor does the eligibility requirement denote a political rather than racial classification. Finally, the protection under Morton v. Mancari is inappropriate. The Petitioner would deny that there is any \\"special relationship\\" at all, for there is no \\"former sovereign\\" or \\"historical relationship\\" clause in the Constitution, and the analogy with Indian tribes thus has no legal standing. The State of Hawaii disagreed. For them, whether the elections qualified as \\"special purpose\\" or contained explicit racial qualifications for participation were secondary concerns. The native Hawaiian people had a \\"special relationship\\" with the United States, indeed a sort of semi-sovereign status, analogous to that of native Indian tribes, which affords them a large measure of self-determination. They would seek to demonstrate that this status had been legitimized repeatedly by Congress, though it had never been made explicit by treaty or codified in the U.S. Constitution. No matter, because the Court would be sharply reminded that granting such status falls within the powers of Congress, not the Courts, and that the understanding was legitimized by ample precedent and circumstances. In order to understand this extraordinary defense, some background is necessary. The Kingdom of Hawaii was an independent, sovereign nation from 1810 until 1893. Throughout this period, the increasing economic interests of American businessmen began to clash with the interests of the Hawaiian government. In 1887, under the threat of violence, the Kingdom's Prime Minister was compelled to resign, and a new Constitution was implemented. This heavily curtailed the administrative power of the monarchy. When Queen Lili'uokalani took steps in 1893 to counter this imposition, she was overthrown in a coup d'état by the Committee of Safety which was composed of white businessmen, missionaries and colonists (both Hawaiian citizens and foreign nationals). The Committee set up a provisional government led by themselves, and the next year declared the existence of the Republic of Hawaii. In 1898, the Republic accepted annexation by the United States, and when President McKinley signed the Annexation and Organic Acts soon thereafter, Hawaii became a U.S. Territory. At this time, of land, formerly overseen by the crown, were ceded to the United States. The Annexation Act stipulated that all revenues and proceeds from the use of this public land would \\"be used solely for the benefit of the inhabitants of the Hawaiian Islands for educational and other purposes.\\" The Organic Act similarly held that all \\"funds arising from the sale or lease or other disposal ... shall be applied such uses and purposes for the benefit of the inhabitants of the Territory of Hawaii.\\" Seeing the subsequent cultural and economic decline of Hawaii's native population, in 1920 the U.S. Congress passed the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act (HHCA), which placed 200,000 of those acres under the authority of said Commission, such that they could be leased by Native Hawaiians for token sums. A \\"Native Hawaiian\\" was defined as \\"any descendant of not less than one-half part of the blood of the races inhabiting the Hawaiian Islands previous to 1778.\\" That date, 1778, is the year in which Captain Cook \\"discovered\\" the islands, and thus the date of the first known Western presence. When Hawaii became a state in 1959, it was agreed that the state would include the HHCA in its own Constitution, including the specific definition of Native Hawaiian. In 1978 the state Constitution was amended to provide for the Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA), which would hold the lease on those lands not already under the purview of the HHCA. The OHA lands would be similarly held in a \\"trust\\" managed for the benefit of Native Hawaiians. = Petitioner's argument = For the Petitioner, the relevant history of Hawaii begins with the Annexation Resolution, not in the previous era of sovereignty. Claims of sovereignty based upon the status or political standing of Natives prior to the 1893 coup are both mistaken and irrelevant. The Petitioner's Brief notes that at the time of their transfer, \\"these 'public lands' were held by the Republic of Hawaii free and clear of any encumbrances or trust obligations. None of the former citizens of the Hawaiian kingdom held any cognizable interest in these lands\\" (3). To support this claim the Petitioner notes that only the Monarch enjoyed title to \\"Crown lands.\\" When these lands were ceded by the Republic of Hawaii to the United States, the Resolution stipulated that these lands would \\"be used solely for the benefit of the inhabitants of the Hawaiian Islands for educational and other public purposes.\\" (Emphasis added by Petitioner). The Petitioner would use population statistics up through the turn of the 20th century to show that the Kingdom of Hawaii had been \\"consciously multiracial,\\" and thus the term \\"inhabitants\\" referred to numerous races, including Westerners. Furthermore, the date of 1778 had obviously been chosen for the eligibility requirements because \\"it marks the last days of what might be characterized as the era of relative 'racial purity' in the Hawaiian Islands.\\" (25). Any claim of a connection between that date and sovereignty status for native Hawaiians is bogus, for the Kingdom of Hawaii did not exist until 1810. Also, during the era of the Hawaiian kingdom, many who would not qualify as Hawaiian under the OHA statute were, in fact, full citizens of the Kingdom. In particularly strong terms, the OHA is denounced for using a \\"blood quantum\\" to define eligibility status, a requirement that is \\"disturbingly reminiscent of the 'Blood Protection' and 'Citizenship' laws adopted as part of the infamous Nuremberg Laws\\". The Petitioner also denies that Salyer, with its \\"special limited purpose\\" exception to the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection clause, is appropriate in this case. First, because Salyer dealt with land ownership, and not race, it does not apply to begin with. The 9th Circuit Court thus made a grievous error when it determined that this case was \\"'not the sort [of election] that has previously triggered Fifteenth Amendment analysis'.\\" (Pet. Br. 18). Such a determination would \\"create an infinitely elastic loophole\\" in which anyone could circumvent the 15th amendment by simply claiming that the purposes of any such election was \\"limited.\\" The Petitioner quotes Terry v. Adams (1953), which held that the 15th Amendment's prohibition of race-based election laws \\"included any election in which public issues are decided or public officials selected.\\" (19) Furthermore, Salyer is an inappropriate defense under the 15th Amendment because it was decided as an exception to the 14th Amendment, due to that amendment's \\"one man, one vote\\" rule. Thus, it cannot be applied to the 15th Amendment's explicit ban on race-based qualifications. The Petitioner quotes from Gomillion v. Lightfoot (1960) to illustrate that the 15th Amendment is absolute, no matter how carefully constructed the means to a racially discriminatory end. That case concerned a district in Alabama that had been drafted such that it excluded all potential non-white voters. Though race was mentioned nowhere in the statute, it had been struck down due to the clearly racially discriminatory result. Quoting Lane v. Wilson (1939) as well, the Petitioner notes that the 15th Amendment \\"'nullifies sophisticated as well as simple-minded modes of discrimination'\\" and goes on to say that \\"In contrast to the purportedly race-neutral grandfather clauses, white primaries, and gerrymanders invalidated in the foregoing cases, the OHA voting restriction is startlingly 'simple-minded'. Hawaii closes its election booth to anyone who fails its racial test\\" (16). The OHA cannot be justified on the grounds that enfranchisement is limited to those who are the interested parties, for the same logic could have been applied to the Gomillion gerrymander case. \\"Both constitute attempts to achieve a 'racially pure' voting bloc justified on the ground that the right to vote has merely been limited to those 'primarily affected' by the decisions of the elected officials.\\" Besides, the entire concept of an exception under Salyer is inapplicable in the first place, even if it did constitute an exception to the 15th as well as the 14th amendment. This is because the \\"'disproportionate effect' prong requires, at a minimum, that the costs of those activities be borne disproportionately by those granted the right to vote ... the Salyer exception, therefore, cannot be applied to the OHA, a state agency that expends substantial funds drawn from taxes paid by all citizens of Hawaii without regard to race\\" (20). Because those state officials chosen in OHA elections \\"manage and spend both legislative appropriations and public lands proceeds, it is axiomatic that all Hawaiian citizens ... have a legitimate interest in the proper management of those funds\\" (20-21). Furthermore, the comparative wealth of those funds and the \\"sweeping\\" authority with which the OHA manages them, along with the numerous and government-like programs that it administers, render the comparison between a small water storage district and the OHA untenable. More controversially, the Petitioner discounts the idea that there is a \\"compelling state interest\\" in limiting the OHA elections based on the history the State's relationship with native Hawaiians (i.e., in order to protect against current discrimination or offset the effects of past discrimination). \\"Nothing in the record demonstrates ... the existence of any past or present discrimination against racial 'Hawaiians'.\\" (31). The Petitioner sarcastically notes that \\"The Respondent now takes the position that the State of Hawaii has a compelling interest in engaging in blatant discrimination today – and indefinitely into the future – in order to make up for even-handed treatment of all Hawaiian citizens, regardless of race, in the past\\" (32). Nor may a compelling interest be inferred from the necessity for the State to uphold its \\"trust\\" relationship with the natives, for the Supreme Court \\"has never held that a legislatively declared 'trust' relationship suffices to justify racial discrimination in voting\\" (31). Furthermore, the use of Morton v. Mancari to illustrate the nature of that implied \\"special relationship\\" has no bearing on Hawaii. For one thing, in recognizing that the Constitution's Indian Commerce and Treaty Clauses denotes such a relationship for Indian Tribes, Morton v. Mancari's outcome \\"was expressly predicated on the fact that the challenged preference involved a tribal, rather than racial, classification\\" (39). More importantly, native Hawaiians do not constitute a federally recognized Indian Tribe. The Petitioner notes that the 1867 treaty which ceded Alaska included a clause by which all inhabitants would be given U.S. citizenship \\"with the exception of the uncivilized native tribes.\\" By contrast, the Organic Act of 1900, which granted territorial status to Hawaii, provided citizenship to \\"all persons who were citizens of the Republic of Hawaii\\" in 1898. This, of course, included native Hawaiians; the Petitioner then points out that, in fact, these Native Hawaiians \\"were the dominant political group in Hawaii for several decades after annexation, and were well represented in all forms of public office\\" (43). Thus the \\"special relationship\\" or \\"trust\\" based on tribal sovereignty no bearing on the situation in Hawaii. = Respondent's argument = Naturally, the Respondent did not agree. After reiterating that the voting qualifications are political rather than racial, and that the elections qualify for \\"limited purpose\\" and \\"disproportionate effect\\" exceptions, the Respondent turns quickly to the heart of the matter: the \\"special relationship.\\" Though native Hawaiians are not formally recognized as an Indian tribe, Congress and the Court have \\"recognized a special obligation to America's first inhabitants and their descendants ... and have recognized that Congress is empowered to honor that obligation as it sees fit\\" (Res. Br. 2). Because Congress has explicitly noted that such an obligation pertains to Alaskan Natives, despite their distinction from traditional Indian tribes of the lower 48 states, it naturally follows that this distinction extends to Hawaiian natives as well. For the Petitioner to rely on the literal wording of treaties signed at the turn of the 20th century misses the point entirely. Indeed, by 1898, \\"the era of treaty-making with the indigenous people of the American continent had come to an end,\\" and this is why there is no mention of such a distinction in the Annexation Act (6). Yet, with the creation of the HHCA in 1921, \\"Congress has recognized that it has a special relationship with indigenous Hawaiians, and has sought to enable them to benefit in some measure from their homelands\\" (6). The Respondent goes on to quote Congress' contemporary assertion that the HHCA \\"affirm[ed] the trust relationship between the United States and the Native Hawaiians\\" (42 U.S.C. § 11701 (13)) as well as the statement that \\"In recognition of the special relationship which exists between the United States and the Native Hawaiian people, [it] has extended to Native Hawaiians the same rights and privileges accorded to American Indian, Alaska Native, Eskimo, and Aleut communities\\" (20 U.S.C. § 7902(13)) (both as quoted in Respondent's Brief, 8-9). Special attention is given to the 1993 Joint Resolution of Congress known as the \\"Apology Resolution,\\" which expressed regret for the role of the United States in the 1893 coup and \\"the deprivation of the rights of Native Hawaiians to self-determination.\\" The Respondent further notes that \\"The [apology resolution] specifically acknowledged that 'the health and well- being of the Native Hawaiian people is intrinsically tied to ... the land', that land was taken from Hawaiians without their consent or compensation, and that indigenous Hawaiians have 'never directly relinquished their claims ... over their national lands'.\\" (8). The Respondent cites numerous other Congressional utterances that refer to \\"special\\" or \\"trust\\" relationships, or which refer to Native Hawaiians as \\"distinct\\" or \\"unique\\" indigenous peoples. In creating the OHA and the voting requirements thereof, Hawaii was simply \\"reaffirming the 'solemn trust obligation and responsibility to native Hawaiians'.\\" (Res. Br. 9). The fact that Congress has consistently recognized and appropriated funds to the OHA implicitly affirms its legitimacy. So does the recognition that the \\"constitution and statutes of the State of Hawaii ... acknowledge the distinct land rights of the Native Hawaiian people as beneficiaries of the public lands trust ... [and] reaffirm and protect the unique right of the Native Hawaiian people to practice and perpetuate their cultural and religious customs, beliefs, practices, and language\\" (42 U.S.C. § 11701 (3) as quoted in Res. Br. 11). In addition, the Hawaiian Constitution was amended in 1978 to include the OHA after an affirmative vote open to all citizens of the State. Finally, given the active role that the U.S. Legislature has taken in affirming the \\"special relationship,\\" and the plenary power given to Congress in acknowledging tribal status (explicitly delegated, in this instance, to the State of Hawaii), it is not appropriate for the Court to deny its existence of that status, or to determine its terms. \\"Classifications based on Congress' decision to assume a special trust relationship with an indigenous people are not based on race, but rather the unique legal and political status that such a relationship entails,\\" and, furthermore, \\"the Framers of the Constitution drew no distinctions among different groups of indigenous people in conferring [such] power ... on Congress, and the Framers of the Civil War Amendments never envisioned that those amendments would restrict the ability of Congress to exercise that power\\" (Res. Br. 14). In other words, by relying on a literal interpretation of said amendments or tribal classifications, the Petitioner was, again, missing the point.  Opinion of the Court  The Supreme Court sided with the Petitioner. In a 7-2 decision based entirely on the 15th Amendment, they reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, with Justices Stevens and Ginsburg dissenting. Justice Kennedy wrote the opinion for the Court, which was joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist, and Justices O'Connor, Scalia and Thomas. They note that the 15th Amendment is certainly not bound by the language or circumstances surrounding its enactment, and that it is \\"quite sufficient to invalidate a scheme which did not mention race but instead used ancestry in an attempt to confine and restrict the voting franchise\\" (16). After all, \\"ancestry can be a proxy for race. It is that proxy here\\" (18). The structure of the OHA elections is \\"neither subtle nor indirect. It is specific in granting the vote to persons of defined ancestry and to no others\\" (17). The Respondent's argument that \\"descendants ... of [the] aboriginal peoples\\" does not mean the same thing as \\"descendants ... of the races\\" is \\"undermined by its express racial purpose and by its actual effects\\" (20). As for Morton v. Mancari, were Hawaii's voting restrictions to be sustained under that authority, \\"we would be required to accept some beginning premises not yet established in our case law\\" (22). Regardless: \\"Even were we to take the substantial step of finding authority in Congress, delegated to the State, to treat Hawaiians or native Hawaiians as tribes, Congress may not authorize a State to create a voting scheme of this sort\\" -- that is, one that uses race as an eligibility requirement (22). The 15th Amendment is absolute even under such conditions, for the election of OHA trustees is still a State election, to which the Amendment clearly applies. Nor is the restriction based on beneficiary status rather than race, for \\"although the bulk of the funds for which OHA is responsible appears to be earmarked for the benefit of 'native Hawaiians', the State permits both 'native Hawaiians' and 'Hawaiians' to vote\\" -- that is, both those who qualify with a 50% blood quantum and those who qualify as descendants of residents in 1778 -- and \\"[this] classification thus appears to create, not eliminate, a differential alignment between the identity of OHA trustees and what the State calls beneficiaries\\" (27). Yet, again, such details are irrelevant to the Court, for \\"Hawaii's argument fails on more essential grounds ... [i.e.] the demeaning premise that citizens of a particular race are somehow more qualified than others to vote on certain matters. That reasoning attacks the central meaning of the Fifteenth Amendment\\" (27). The Court's opinion ends with a brief lecture to the State of Hawaii, concluding with the observation that Hawaii must \\"seek the political consensus that begins with a sense of shared purpose. One of the necessary beginning points is this principle: The Constitution of the United States, too, has become the heritage of all the citizens of Hawaii\\" (28). = Breyer's concurrence = Justice Breyer, in a concurring opinion joined by Justice Souter, elaborates on the problematic analogy between the OHA and a trust for the benefit of an Indian tribe. For Breyer, such a trust does not exist for native Hawaiians under the circumstances, mainly because the OHA electorate \\"does not sufficiently resemble an Indian tribe\\" (2). The OHA's hereditary requirement of an ancestor living in Hawaii in 1778 might include persons with \\"1 possible ancestor out of 500, thereby creating a vast and unknowable body of potential members\\" (4). This, Breyer believes, goes well beyond any \\"reasonable\\" definition of tribal status. = Dissents = Justice Stevens' dissent, joined in part by Justice Ginsburg, takes a much more charitable view of the \\"special relationship\\" between Hawaii and the United States, believing that \\"two centuries of Indian law precedent\\" alone justifies the OHA's voting laws under the Constitution, for \\"there is simply no invidious discrimination present in this effort to see that indigenous peoples are compensated for past wrongs\\" (3). He agrees with the Respondent that under Morton v. Mancari preferential treatment is justified if such treatment \\"can be tied rationally to the fulfillment of Congress' unique obligation towards the Indians\\" (5). Such obligations, Stevens believes, are implicit in the Apology Resolution of 1993, in addition to the more than 150 \\"varied laws passed by Congress ... [which] expressly include native Hawaiians as part of the class of Native Americans benefited\\" (7). Like the Respondent, Stevens believes that to reject the State's claims because native Hawaiians are not technically a \\"tribe\\" is to miss the point. There is a \\"compelling similarity, fully supported by our precedent, between the once subjugated, indigenous peoples of the continental United States and the peoples of the Hawaiian Islands\\" (8). In addition, Stevens points out that tribal membership alone was not the \\"decisive factor\\" when the Court upheld preferential treatment in Morton v. Mancari. In that case, the preference \\"not only extended to non-tribal member Indians, it also required for eligibility ... a certain quantum of Indian blood\\" (9). Thus, there is no tribal limitation concerning the Federal Government's authority over considerations for native peoples. \\"In light of this precedent,” Stevens continues, \\"it is a painful irony indeed to conclude that native Hawaiians are not entitled to special benefits designed to restore a measure of native self-governance because they currently lack any vestigial native government – a possibility of which history and the actions of this Nation have deprived them.\\" As for Breyer's concurring opinion, Stevens succinctly dismisses the objection that the OHA's definition of native is not \\"reasonable\\" by noting simply that \\"this suggestion does not identify a constitutional defect\\" (9).

It was the successor of the defunct Northern Spirit FC, a semi professional soccer club based in North Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales. Northern Spirit entered the National Soccer League in the 1998–99 season. Its founding was inspired in part by the success Perth Glory was enjoying as a mainstream club (as opposed to the league's mainstay European migrant founded clubs), as well as an opportunity to tap into the previously unrepresented northern suburbs of Sydney.  History = Northern Spirit = On the field, the club had early success in the National Soccer League, reaching the finals in its first attempt, but the next two seasons were not nearly as successful, the club finishing 13th in both of them. The club recovered somewhat to finish mid-table in its last 3 seasons, but only managed to make the finals once more, in 2002/03. 2003–04. During Northern Spirit's first season, then Crystal Palace owner Mark Goldberg bought a 31 per cent stake in the club and secured an option for a further 35 per cent. Beset by Palace's financial problems, he relinquished his option to a group of players and coaches including Graham Arnold, Robbie Slater and Ian Crook. The club was later owned by Rangers for a small period of time. Rangers temporarily changed the club's home colours to their own royal blue. Northern Spirit's home games were played at North Sydney Ovalhttp://www.ozfootball.net/ark/NSL/9899/Round01.html and their first league home game (against Sydney Olympic) attracted a then Australian club soccer record crowd (for a non finals match) of 18,985 a record which stood until 2005 when it was broken by Queensland Roar crowd of 20,725 (a record subsequently broken by other games). In the club's final season, Chairman Antonio Gelonesi decided to move the club to Pittwater Park, on Sydney's Northern Beaches. The decision was motivated mainly by money, with North Sydney Oval not drawing enough people to make a profit. The 23,000 capacity Brookvale Oval, a rectangular rugby league venue (home of the Manly-Warringah club) which is located roughly halfway between North Sydney Oval and Pittwater Park, was considered as a possibility for the new home but was eventually overlooked by the Spirit. After enduring financial problems for much of its existence, the club folded after the 2003/2004 NSL season. = Formation of North West Sydney Football Ltd (Gladesville Hornsby Football Association) = The former youth teams of Northern Spirit were assembled into the new Gladesville-Hornsby Football Association, nicknamed Spirit FC, in 2004.In 2019 GHFA merged with North West Sydney Women's Football Association to form North West Sydney Football Ltd. NWSF has its homeground at Christie Park in Macquarie Park, New South Wales. In 2007, won the NSW State League Division 1 premiership, but were not selected to be promoted. In 2008, they again won the State League Division 1 and this time were promoted to the Super League for 2009. In 2013, Football NSW incorporated the National Premier Leagues structure to their competition. GHFA Spirit FC were selected along with 11 other teams to join the new second division of soccer in NSW.

JPF was developed at the NASA Ames Research Center and open sourced in 2005. The acronym JPF is not to be confused with the unrelated Java Plugin Framework project. The core of JPF is a Java Virtual Machine. JPF executes normal Java bytecode programs and can store, match and restore program states. Its primary application has been Model checking of concurrent programs, to find defects such as data races and deadlocks. With its respective extensions, JPF can also be used for a variety of other purposes, including * model checking of distributed applications * model checking of user interfaces * test case generation by means of symbolic execution * low level program inspection * program instrumentation and runtime monitoring JPF has no fixed notion of state space branches and can handle both data and scheduling choices.  Example  The following system under test contains a simple race condition between two threads accessing the same variable \`d\` in statements (1) and (2), which can lead to a division by zero exception if (1) is executed before (2) public class Racer implements Runnable { int d = 42; public void run () { doSomething(1001); d = 0; // (1) } public static void main (String[] args){ Racer racer = new Racer(); Thread t = new Thread(racer); t.start(); doSomething(1000); int c = 420 / racer.d; // (2) System.out.println(c); } static void doSomething (int n) { try { Thread.sleep(n); } catch (InterruptedException ix) {} } } Without any additional configuration, JPF would find and report the division by zero. If JPF is configured to verify absence of race conditions (regardless of their potential downstream effects), it will produce the following output, explaining the error and showing a counter example leading to the error JavaPathfinder v6.0 - (C) RIACS/NASA Ames Research Center  system under test application: Racer.java ...  error #1 gov.nasa.jpf.listener.PreciseRaceDetector race for field Racer@13d.d main at Racer.main(Racer.java:16) \\"int c = 420 / racer.d; \\" : getfield Thread-0 at Racer.run(Racer.java:7) \\"d = 0; \\" : putfield  trace #1 \\\\---- transition #0 thread: 0 ... \\\\---- transition #3 thread: 1 gov.nasa.jpf.jvm.choice.ThreadChoiceFromSet[id=\\"sleep\\",isCascaded:false,{main,>Thread-0}] [3 insn w/o sources] Racer.java:22 : try { Thread.sleep(n); } catch (InterruptedException ix) {} Racer.java:23 : } Racer.java:7 : d = 0; ... \\\\---- transition #5 thread: 0 gov.nasa.jpf.jvm.choice.ThreadChoiceFromSet[id=\\"sharedField\\",isCascaded:false,{>main,Thread-0}] Racer.java:16 : int c = 420 / racer.d;  Extensibility  JPF is an open system that can be extended in a variety of ways. The main extension constructs are * listeners - to implement complex properties (e.g. temporal properties) * peer classes - to execute code at the host JVM level (instead of JPF), which is mostly used to implement native methods * bytecode factories - to provide alternative execution semantics of bytecode instructions (e.g. to implement symbolic execution) * choice generators - to implement state space branches such as scheduling choices or data value sets * serializers - to implement program state abstractions * publishers - to produce different output formats * search policies - to use different program state space traversal algorithms JPF includes a runtime module system to package such constructs into separate JPF extension projects. A number of such projects are available from the main JPF server, including a symbolic execution mode, numeric analysis, race condition detection for relaxed memory models, user interface model checking and many more.  Limitations  * JPF cannot analyze Java native methods. If the system under test calls such methods, these have to be provided within peer classes, or intercepted by listeners * as a model checker, JPF is susceptible to Combinatorial explosion, although it performs on-the-fly Partial order reduction * the configuration system for JPF modules and runtime options can be complex  See also  *MoonWalker - similar to Java PathFinder, but for .NET programs instead of Java programs  External links  *New NASA Software Detects 'Bugs' in Java Computer Code *NASA Develops New Software to Detect \\"Bugs\\" in Java Computer Code  References  *Willem Visser, Corina S.

Doe, 538 U.S. 84 (2003), was a court case in the United States which questioned the constitutionality of the Alaska Sex Offender Registration Act's retroactive requirements. Under the Act, any sex offender must register with the Department of Corrections or local law enforcement within one business day of entering the state. This information is forwarded to the Department of Public Safety, which maintains a public database. Fingerprints, social security number, anticipated change of address, and medical treatment after the offense are kept confidential. The offender's name, aliases, address, photograph, physical description, driver's license number, motor vehicle identification numbers, place of employment, date of birth, crime, date and place of conviction, and length and conditions of sentence are part of the public record, maintained on the Internet. Smith v. Doe questioned the constitutionality of the act's retroactive requirements. John Does I and II were convicted of aggravated assault before the act's passage and filed suit, claiming the act was punitive and violated the ex post facto clause of Article I of the U.S. Constitution. The district court ruled against the Does, ruling that the act was nonpunitive. The appeals court sided with the Does that the act was in fact punitive and violated ex post facto.  Supreme Court's ruling  Held: Because the Alaska Sex Offender Registration Act is nonpunitive, its retroactive application does not violate the ex post facto clause. The question is if the intention was to impose a punishment or \\"civil proceedings\\". If the intention was to punish, that ends the inquiry. If the intention was to enact a regulatory scheme that is civil and nonpunitive, the Court must examine whether the scheme is so punitive as to negate the State's intention to deem it civil. Because the Court ordinarily defers to the legislature's stated intent, only the clearest proof will suffice to override that intent and transform what has been denominated a civil remedy into a criminal penalty. The Court decided 6–3 that the legislature's intent was to create a civil, nonpunitive program to protect the public and that the resulting dissemination of the registration information was not significant enough to declare as debilitating. The dissenting justices contended that the law was punitive and imposed severe deprivations of liberty. Justice Stevens' dissenting opinion said, \\"It is also clear beyond peradventure that these unique consequences of conviction of a sex offense are punitive. They share three characteristics, which in the aggregate are not present in any civil sanction. The sanctions (1) constitute a severe deprivation of the offender's liberty, (2) are imposed on everyone who is convicted of a relevant criminal offense, and (3) are imposed only on those criminals. Unlike any of the cases that the Court has cited, a criminal conviction under these statutes provides both a sufficient and a necessary condition for the sanction\\".

Located between the River Pegnitz in the east and the south, the River Regnitz in the west and the River Main in the north, its relief, which reaches 600 metres in height, forms the northern part of the Franconian Jura (Frankenjura). As several other mountainous landscapes in the German-speaking lands, e.g. Holstein Switzerland, Märkische Schweiz, or Pommersche Schweiz, Franconian Switzerland was given its name by Romantic artists and poets in the 19th century who compared the landscape to Switzerland. The Franconian Switzerland is famous for its high density of traditional breweries. Name The region was once called Muggendorfer Gebürg (Muggendorf hills). The first tourists arrived during the age of Romanticism. Two law students of Erlangen University, Ludwig Tieck and Wilhelm Heinrich Wackenroder have been credited as \\"discoverers\\" of the region. The episode \\"Eine Reise in die Fränkische Schweiz\\" in their joint production Franz Sternbalds WanderungenFranz Sternbalds Wanderungen: \\"Wanderings of Franz Sternbald\\". (Berlin, 1798) enthralled many contemporaries. Ludwig Tieck, who publicized the region. The 1820 book Die kleine Schweiz (Little Switzerland), written by Jakob Reiselsberger of Waischenfeld, gave the region its name. In 1829, a book by German salesman and local historian Joseph Heller, Muggendorf und seine Umgebung oder die Fränkische Schweiz (Muggendorf and its surrounding or the Franconian Switzerland) was published. The description Switzerland was common during the 19th century for landscapes with mountains, valleys and most significantly rocks, e.g., Saxon Switzerland, Marcher Switzerland, Mecklenburg Switzerland and Holstein Switzerland. Geography Franconian Switzerland is the northern part of the Franconian Jura. It is often loosely defined as the region bounded by the rivers Main to the north, Regnitz to the west and Pegnitz to the east or by the motorways of the A 70 to the north, A 9 to the east and A 73 to the west. However, the actual region of Franconian Switzerland is only the catchment area of the River Wiesent. The region covers parts of the counties of Bamberg, Bayreuth and Forchheim. Its best known settlements include Pottenstein, Gößweinstein, Muggendorf, Ebermannstadt, Streitberg, Egloffstein, and Waischenfeld. Its boundaries are Obermainland (north), Erlangen (south), Bayreuth (east), Forchheim (west), and Bamberg (northwest). Information about Franconian Switzerland may be found inter alia in the Franconian Switzerland Museum in Tüchersfeld with its comprehensive regional collections. It is housed in the so-called Jew's Court (Judenhof) below two steep rock pinnacles. =Franconian Switzerland Trade Association= The following 18 municipalities across 2 counties belong to the Franconian Switzerland Trade Association (Wirtschaftsverband Fränkische Schweiz): *County of Bayreuth: **Ahorntal **Betzenstein **Creußen **Gesees **Haag **Hummeltal **Pegnitz **Plech **Pottenstein **Prebitz **Schnabelwaid *County of Forchheim: **Egloffstein **Gößweinstein **Gräfenberg **Hiltpoltstein **Igensdorf **Obertrubach **Weißenohe =Geology= Tower karst rocks in Tüchersfeld, 2008 In the White Jurassic period, about 161 million to 150 million years ago, a shallow sea lay across the whole of southern Germany. During this period, thick rock sequences were deposited on the seabed as the earth's crust constantly sank. The landscape of Franconian Switzerland is strongly influenced by the resulting limestone and dolomite rocks of the White Jurassic. It is a typical karst landscape with deeply incised river valleys and dry, arid plateaus. Many fossils, especially ammonites, may be found in the limestone strata. In the late Jurassic period, uplifting of the European continental plate caused the sea to recede and larger areas of land formed at the beginning of the subsequent Cretaceous period. During this time there was a tropical climate and there was intense weathering of limestone and dolomite rocks. During the Cretaceous a sea again advanced into the region of the Franconian Switzerland. In the Tertiary period, the sea receded again due to local uplifting and partially exposed the Jurassic landscape. =Mountains and hills= The most prominent peak is commonly known as \\"Walberla\\", a table hill east of Forchheim. Its official name is the Ehrenbürg. The Ehrenbürg consists of two peaks, the Rodenstein (532 m) and the Walberla (512 m). On the hilltop is its namesake, the small Walburgis Chapel, first mentioned in a 1360 manuscript. There is an annual festival on the hilltop on 30 April, the birthday of Saint Walburga, which attracts thousands of people. Other popular high points are as follows: *Leienfels (near Pottenstein), 590 m *Spiegelfels along with the Pfarrfelsen near Affalterthal, Markt Egloffstein, 468 m *Wichsenstein (near Gössweinstein), 587 m *Signalstein (near Wolfsberg, Obertrubach), 582 m *Little Kulm (near Körbeldorf), 623 m *Hohenmirsberger Plateau (near Pottenstein), 614 m *Neubürg (near Wohnsgehaig), 587 m *Tannenberg, 599 m *Graubühl (near Creussen), 569 m Rock climbing at the Eulenwand near Tiefenellern The rocks of Franconian Switzerland's mountains and hills are popular for rock climbing. With more than 6,500 routes it is one of the best developed climbing areas in the world. Important climbing areas are as follows: *Trubach Valley *Walberla *Wiesent Valley *Leinleiter Valley *Püttlach Valley *Aufsess Valley =Caves= Stalagmite in the Binghöhle There are countless caves in Franconian Switzerland, of which the Devil's Cave (Teufelshöhle) near Pottenstein is the most famous. The region is a typical example for a Karst topography. Accessible caves are as follows: *Binghöhle (near Streitberg) *Teufelshöhle (near Pottenstein) *Sophienhöhle (in the Ailsbach valley) *Oswaldhöhle (near Muggendorf) *Rosenmüllershöhle (near Muggendorf) *Quackenschloss (near Engelhardsberg), cave ruin *Zoolithenhöhle (near Burggailenreuth) *Esperhöhle (near Gössweinstein) *Förstershöhle (in the Zeubach valley) *Schönsteinhöhle (in the Long Valley) *Klauskirche (near Betzenstein) *Riesenburg (near Doos) *Hasenlochhöhle (near Pottenstein), known for having housed people during the Stone Age. =Castles= Greifenstein Palace The ruins of Neideck Castle Franconian Switzerland is located along the so-called Castle Road (Burgenstraße), which connects more than 70 castles, palaces and fortresses between Mannheim and Prague. Most of these castles were constructed in the Middle Ages.

It describes the colorful decoration of public water wells during the Easter season. During the time of modernization and the construction of canalization, this custom had lost its significance. Only in the early 1980s, it was rediscovered and in 1986 169 villages again decorated their water wells. Today, more than 200 villages decorate their village well with coloured easter eggs. The main reason for this custom is probably the significance of water for the arid high plateau of Franconian Switzerland. The Bieberbach Osterbrunnen (Egloffstein) was admitted to the Guinness Book of Records as \\"the largest Osterbrunnen of the world\\". Tourism Franconian Switzerland has the highest density of breweries in the world: Brewery/pub in Aufseß Franconian Switzerland is one of the oldest tourist regions in Germany. The first travelers arrived at the beginning of the 19th century. The most attractive tourist locations are the many caves. A large range of outdoor activities is possible in the area. Beside countless hiking paths the area is popular for its great rock climbing and canoeing options. Most important is however the impressing nature, which should be preserved by every visitor. Home to the annual Frankonian Switzerland Marathon, beginning in Forchheim and slowly climbing to Sachsenmühle-Wende, then back to Ebermannstadt, the area includes 375 km of some of the best trails for running, Nordic walking, and rambling in Germany maintained by the European-Community-funded Running Experience Project which was launched in July 2011. The Franconian Switzerland Steam Railway (Dampfbahn Fränkische Schweiz) or DFS is a museum railway based in Ebermannstadt251 that operates steam and diesel specials on Sundays and on public holidays.

He is the head of an international program of scientific cooperation between France and Chile. Approach Olivier Ihl is with Yves Déloye one of the main representatives of the school of the historical sociology of politics, which consists in crossing the contributions of three disciplines (sociology, history, political science) to seize complex phenomena such vote, sciences of government, the Republic, etc. =Topics= The guiding thread of his research is the representation of politics; he notably studied the republican commemorations, the rites of commensalité (e.g. banquets), political protocol, street names, presidential travels, act of voting, democracy, populism, electoral frauds, relation between violence and politics, socio-history of rewards, distinctions and merit. =Material history= The apprehension of historic facts by people and by things which make them concretely rather than by the big ideas or the institutional narratives.

Retrieved 16 May 2009 Bloom is a longtime fan of Brighton and his family has had a long association with the club: his uncle Ray is a director and his grandfather, Harry, was vice-chairman during the 1970s. On becoming chairman, Bloom appointed former Uruguay international Gus Poyet as manager, and together they led the team to promotion from Football League One as champions in 2011, the season before Brighton moved into their new home - the Falmer Stadium. Poyet left the club in 2013 after losing in a play-off semi-final to Crystal Palace. In June 2013, Bloom appointed Óscar García as the new head coach of the club; Garcia resigned after losing a second successive play-off semi-final to Derby County and left the club in May 2014. The next manager was former Liverpool player Sami Hyypiä, who only lasted a few months in the managerial role after a poor start to the 2014–15 season left Brighton in the relegation zone. Chris Hughton became manager towards the end of 2014, and the club have been successful since. Hughton steered Albion to safety in their 2014–15 campaign, and then guided the club to a 3rd-place position in the Championship in the following season, missing out on promotion to Middlesbrough on goal difference. The club would be defeated in the play-off semi final, for the third time in four years, this time to Sheffield Wednesday. Brighton went one step further in the 2016–17 season under Hughton's management and Bloom's ownership, finishing 2nd in the Championship and gaining promotion to the Premier League for the first time in the club's history. Bloom backed Hughton in the following transfer window, breaking several record transfer fees to improve the squad, readying Brighton's first Premier League season. On 13 May 2019, immediately after the end of the season, with the club ending at the 17th position and thus securing its top-tier status for the coming season, Bloom released a statement to the effect that \\"it was time for a change\\" and sacked Hughton, replacing him with Championship's Swansea coach Graham Potter.

Gladesville is located 10 kilometres north-west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Ryde and the Municipality of Hunter's Hill.Gregory's Sydney Street Directory, Gregory's Publishing Company, 2007 Gladesville is part of the federal electorates of North Sydney and Bennelong. Gladesville possesses riverside views and bush settings along the Parramatta River. The nearby Gladesville Bridge (a Sydney landmark that links the North Shore to the Inner West) takes its name from the suburb. History=Aboriginal= The Gladesville area was home to Indigenous Australians before European settlement. Evidence of their presence can still be found in the area. For instance there are rock carvings and grinding grooves that can be seen in Glades Bay Park, which overlooks Glades Bay. =European= The area was first called Doody’s Bay during the beginnings of European settlement, marked by a land grant being given to convict artist, John Doody (1795). Others to receive grants in the district were William House (1795), Ann Benson (1796) and Charles Raven (1799). By 1836, John Glade, an emancipist, was issued with the deeds to Doody’s grant, which he had purchased in 1817. Glade expanded his property with the purchase of a number of adjoining holdings. After John Glade’s death in 1848, his land was sold to a Sydney solicitor, Mr W. Billyard, who subsequently subdivided and sold the land in November 1855, naming it Gladesville. A major milestone in the development of the suburb was the establishment of the Tarban Creek Lunatic Asylum in 1838,Government Records:Retrieved 12 January 2009 on the banks of the Parramatta River. It was the first purpose-built mental asylum in New South Wales. Much of the architecture was designed by Colonial Architect Mortimer Lewis and built between 1836 and 1838. In 1869 it became the Gladesville Hospital for the Insane, and in 1915 the Gladesville Mental Hospital. In 1993, it was amalgamated with Macquarie Hospital to form the Gladesville Macquarie Hospital. In 1997, inpatient services were consolidated at Macquarie Hospital at North Ryde. The Gladesville complex includes many buildings which are listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register and the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate.The Heritage of Australia, Macmillan Company, 1981, p.2/29 One of the hospital's acquisitions was a two-storey sandstone house called The Priory, in Salter Street. It was built in the late 1840s, possibly by the Stubbs family, and featured an east-looking face in the Georgian style, and a west face with a gable and painted sundial. In the 1850s it was sold to the Marist Fathers, a French group who had an influence on the early development of Hunters Hill. The hospital acquired it in 1888; it was listed on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate in 1978. Banjo Paterson Park Another historical landmark is the cottage Rockend, where the poet Banjo Paterson lived in the 1870s and 1880s. It was built circa 1850 and is still preserved and open to the public in Banjo Paterson Park, Punt Road. It is listed on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate. The site joins the Bedlam Bay walk, where remnants of the Great North Road exists and the walls of the Bedlam Bay Ferry. Banjo Paterson lived in the sandstone house (now a restaurant) whilst attending Sydney Grammar School. The house was owned by his Grandmother and was frequented by many artists and writers. Banjo Paterson recalled in a radio interview in 1935 that the river had declined and was now lined with factories. However he could still remember when;'On the River' by A.B. Paterson, broadcast 14 July 1935, in The Ryde Recorder, Vol 7 No. 1, 1 February 1973, p4. Source: Focus on Ryde, a local studies resource, Ryde Bicentenary Schools and Youth Task Force, May 1992 Ryde River Walk Masterplan at Ryde City Council Halmeg Linseed oil was manufactured on a mill located at the end of Punt Road, overlooking Glass Bay. The linseed oil was used in the manufacturing of lead paint and varnish, as well as putties, caulking compounds, printing inks and linoleum. The production plant was established in 1923. The revolutionary extraction process did not work at first. Despite this, one hundred guests toured the new mill at its official opening. Harold Meggit, owner of the plant, increased employees wages, also advising that there would be no jobs and no wages if a new solution to distil the oil could not be found. The employees put forward hundreds of suggestions, and two were implemented. In later years, Halmeg was the first to produce Safflower Oil in Australia. It also introduced a profit sharing scheme for its employees. The site closed in 1974. In 2016 the local community crowned Madeleine Paslis as the Queen of Gladesville. Ryde River Walk Masterplan at Ryde City Council Heritage listings Gladesville has a number of heritage- listed sites, including: * Manning Road: The Priory, Gladesville * 144 Ryde Road: Gladesville Drill Hall * Victoria Road: Gladesville Bridge Education There are four primary schools in the suburb: Gladesville Public School, Our Lady Queen of Peace Catholic Primary School, Christ Church Gladesville Preschool and Boronia Park Public School.

St Joseph’s College (Boys) and Villa Maria Primary School are located in Hunters Hill. Holy Cross College (Boys) is located in Ryde and Marist Sisters' College Woolwich (Girls) is located near the peninsula of Woolwich. Ryde Secondary College, a public school, is located nearby in Ryde. Demographics At the 2016 census, there were 11,827 residents in Gladesville. The majority of people (64.9%) stated they were born in Australia, with other top responses being China 3.9%, England 3.2%, Italy 2.2%, New Zealand 1.8% and India 1.1%. 69.2% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin 3.4%, Italian 3.4%, Cantonese 2.9%, Greek 2.6% and Spanish 1.3%. Catholic (33.1%) was the most common religious affiliation, followed by No Religion 27.3% and Anglican 11.7%.\\\\ Gladesville is an affluent suburb. The largest three groups of occupations were Professionals (32.8%), Managers (19.1%), and Clerical and Administrative Workers (15.1%). The median weekly incomes for Gladesville were significantly higher than that of Australia, being Personal: $934.00, Family: $2,515.00, and Household: $1,922.00. The dwelling types in Gladesville were evenly spread between separate houses and semi-detached or units. Median monthly mortgage payments were $2,500 and this was higher than the national median of $1,755. Economy Gladesville is serviced by a commercial district centred on Victoria Road, the suburb's main thoroughfare, and by a small shopping centre (Gladesville Shopping Village) located off Cowell Street. A number of restaurants and cafes are situated within the commercial parts of Gladesville, and serve a variety of foods including Thai, Indian, Vietnamese, Greek, Mexican and Italian. These are closely situated in regards to residential buildings. Entertainment venues include the Bayview Tavern and Gladesville RSL Club. The Sawdust Hotel was once a prominent venue but is now closed. Plans to redevelop the site by Hunters Hill Council (including the removal of an important local heritage building) remain strongly opposed by some local residents. Despite complaints by many local residents to preserve the existing mix of boutique shopping and low density housing, the local municipal council has committed the suburb to high density residential redevelopment and strip mall shopping centres.

A soft key is a button flexibly programmable to invoke any of a number of functions rather than being associated with a single fixed function or a fixed set of functions. A softkey often takes the form of a screen- labeled function key located alongside a display device, where the button invokes a function described by the text at that moment shown adjacent to the button on the display. Soft keys are also found away from the display device, for example on the sides of cellular phones, where they are typically programmed to invoke functions such as PTT, memo, or volume control. Function keys on keyboards are a form of soft key. In contrast, a hard key is a key with dedicated function such as the keys on a number keypad. Screen-labeled function keys are today most commonly found in kiosk applications, such as automated teller machines and gas pumps. Screen-label function keys date to aviation applications in the late 1960s. Kiosk applications were particularly common in the 1990s and 2000s. Screen-labeled function keys are found in automotive and aviation applications such as in the primary flight and multi- function displays. An alternative to screen-labeled function keys is buttons (virtual keys) on a touchscreen, where the label is directly pushable. The increased prevalence of touchscreens in the 2000s has led to a decrease in screen-labeled function keys. However, screen-labeled function keys are inexpensive and robust, and provide tactile feedback. History ATM in Mercer Island, Washington with function keys Early examples are found in aviation glass cockpits, such as the Mark II avionics of the F-111D in the late 1960s/early 1970s (first ordered 1967, delivered 1970–73). Hewlett- Packard developed them for use in computers/calculators in the 1970s. The HP 9830 desktop computer was the first calculator with two rows of 4 keys, over which a paper overlay would be placed. These were later adapted to terminals. Programmers found that the HP 2640 terminals could lock the top two lines of the screen, so they displayed the key functions there. Starting with HP 2647 terminal, the keys were re-arranged to correspond with 2 pairs of 4 labels at the bottom of the screen. These could be programmed by escape sequence or configuration screen. This would be further developed on the failed HP 300 Amigo, which used keys at the right side of the screen and HP 250 business computers which placed them at the bottom. By arranging functions in hierarchical trees, many functions can be implemented with only 8 keys. Graphical calculators , HP calculators use this arrangement to implement hierarchical trees of functions. They are rarely found on PC applications, even though the first IBM PC BASIC labeled function key use at the bottom of the screen, and there were 12 function keys, patterned after use on IBM terminals. Modern Texas Instruments calculators such as the TI-89 series use function keys to open drop-down menus on their menu bar, the menu title acting like the key label. Casio calculators use the function keys for a menu at the bottom of the screen. Mobile phone A typical mobile phone with soft keys has them located beneath the bottom left and bottom right of the display; some, especially those made by Nokia, have an additional center soft key, activated by pressing on the center of the directional pad. Depending on the modality of the application, various functions can be mapped onto it. It can also bring up multiple functions listed on a pop-up expanded menu. Usually the prompt text on the display for the softkey is not allowed to be truncated or omitted with ellipsis. The softkey itself is usually not printed with a functional icon or text, but is often marked with a dot or short bar. Soft keys have become increasingly rare as touchscreens take the place of function keys on many modern smartphones. Point of sale Screen-labeled function keys have found use in point of sale systems; NCR Corporation claims that their DynaKey system \\"has been proven to reduce training time and cashier errors\\".

Festivals by year=2007= The Granny Smith Festival in 2007 was of particular significance, in that it became a major campaign venue for the Australian federal election, 2007. For the first time in the Festival's 22-year history, it was officially opened by the (then) local Member of parliament, Prime minister John Howard. There were speculations that his appearance was largely due to the emergence of a serious challenge towards not just his Coalition government, but indeed his very own parliamentary seat of Bennelong, from high-profile ALP candidate Maxine McKew. Apart from Howard and McKew, a number of other local politicians, along with hundreds of volunteers representing numerous political parties and interest groups, attended the Festival, with a large contingent of media crew following their campaign trails. =2008= The 2008 Granny Smith Festival was of important significance with the Ryde by- election being held on the same day, Saturday October 18.

The club has three senior sides and a junior section. The first and second teams play in the Cheshire Cricket League, while the third team play in the Cheshire County Cricket League. Ground Stockport Cricket Club was formed in 1855, and has had 2 previous grounds before moving to Cale Green in 1883. These were on Charles Street, Higher Hillgate and on Greek Street. The Cale Green Ground was donated, along with the adjacent Cale Green Park, by Henry Bell, the former Mayor of Stockport. The cricket ground is one of the largest in the borough at 135 yards wide and 130 yards long, and the site also accommodates a lacrosse pitch, two bowling greens, the pavilion and a war memorial. History Stockport Cricket Club was a member of the Manchester Cricket Association until 1937, when the club joined the Central Lancashire League. During this time the club had a number of periods of success, notably the 1960s, when 12 trophies were won by the clubs first and second XI. While in the CLL the club had a number of well known players, with the most recognisable name being Vinoo Mankad, the Indian all-rounder. Future county cricketers including Barry Dudleston also played at the club in this period. Financial difficulties forced the club to resign from the CLL in 1998, and the club merged with Stockport Sunday School and took their place in the Derbyshire and Cheshire Cricket League. The club experienced much success in this league and both the seniors and juniors, with the club winning a league competition every season and individual players collecting numerous personal awards. The junior sides were particularly strong, especially at Under 17 level where the club had a 6 season spell unbeaten in their league division, starting in 2001 and finally ending in 2007. The club resigned from the DCCL at the end of the 2007 season, and entered into the Cheshire pyramid for the start of the 2008 season. The ground was used for shooting many scenes of play for the 2014 film Believe. Cenotaph The war memorial at the corner of the cricket field is dedicated to the memory of the 18 members who died in World Wars I and II, and has the following inscriptions:- AND THESE MEN DIED LEAVING THEIR DEATH FOR AN EXAMPLE OF A NOBLE COURAGE AND A MEMORIAL OF VIRTUE UNTO ALL THE NATION II Macabees 6 SONS OF THIS PLACE LET THIS OF YOU BE SAID THAT YOU WHO LIVE ARE WORTHY OF YOUR DEAD THESE GAVE THEIR LIVES THAT YOU WHO LIVE MAY REAP A RICHER HARVEST ERE YOU FALL ASLEEP Rev T E Royde THERE'S BUT ONE TASK FOR ALL FOR EACH ONE LIFE TO GIVE WHO STANDS, IF FREEDOM FALL WHO DIES, IF ENGLAND LIVE Rudyard Kipling File:scccenotaph.jpg External links *  References  Category:Sport in Stockport Category:English club cricket teams Category:1855 establishments in England Category:Cricket in Greater Manchester Category:Organisations based in Stockport ","title":"Stockport Cricket Club"},{"id":"2285678","title":"Victor Emmanuel II Monument"},{"id":"2285690","text":"Apache Velocity is a Java-based template engine that provides a template language to reference objects defined in Java code. It aims to ensure clean separation between the presentation tier and business tiers in a Web application (the model–view–controller design pattern). Velocity is an open source software project hosted by the Apache Software Foundation. It is released under the Apache License. Jon Scott Stevens derived the name from the AltiVec Velocity Engine in the PowerPC G4 chip.  Uses  Some common types of applications that use Velocity are: *AWS API Gateway body mapping template.Web applications: Web developers render HTML page structures. The content is populated with dynamic information. The page is processed with VelocityViewServlet or any of a number of frameworks that support Velocity. * Source code generation: Velocity can be used to generate Java, SQL, or PostScript source code, based on templates. A number of open source and commercial development software packages use Velocity in this manner. * Automatic emails: Many applications generate automatic emails for account signup, password reminders, or automatically sent reports. Using Velocity, the email template can be stored in a text file, rather than directly embedded in Java code. * XML transformation: Velocity provides an Ant task, called Anakia, which reads an XML file and makes it available to a Velocity template. A common application is to convert software documentation stored in a generic \\"xdoc\\" format into a styled HTML document. *AWS API Gateway uses Apache Velocity engine for body mapping templates - JSON is output.  Code examples  The following template: ## Velocity Hello World #set( $foo = \\"Velocity\\" ) ## followed by Hello $foo World! processed by Velocity produces the following HTML: Hello Velocity World! Another example using conditions: #if( $foo < 10 ) **Go North** #elseif( $foo  10 ) **Go East** #elseif( $bar  6 ) **Go South** #else **Go West** #end For AWS API Gateway body mapping template, for DynamoDB HTTP: { \\"TableName\\": \\"happy-marketer\\", \\"KeyConditionExpression\\": \\"pk = :pk AND begins_with(sk, :sk)\\", #if ($input.params('projectStatus')  'archived') \\"FilterExpression\\": \\"projectStatus = :Archived\\", #else \\"FilterExpression\\": \\"projectStatus = :InProgress OR projectStatus = :Completed\\", #end \\"ExpressionAttributeValues\\": { \\":pk\\": { \\"S\\": \\"project\\" }, \\":sk\\": { \\"S\\": \\"$context.authorizer.claims.email\\" }, #if ($input.params('projectStatus')  'archived') \\":Archived\\": { \\"S\\": \\"Archived\\" } #else \\":InProgress\\": { \\"S\\": \\"In Progress\\" }, \\":Completed\\": { \\"S\\": \\"Completed\\" } #end } } Another example with optional array; without condition will fail because of invalid resulting JSON: { \\"email\\": \\"$context.authorizer.claims.email\\" #if ($input.params('countries') != \\"\\") , \\"countries\\": $input.params('countries') #end } The syntax and overall concept of the Apache Velocity templates is similar to the syntax of the older WebMacro template engine, which is now also an open source project.

The comic mostly follows the original work's plot, but is heavily influenced by punk culture and anarchism. Various characters have been replaced with more \\"adult\\" versions: the Lost Boys are punks, the Natives are hippies, the pirates are rockers, and the mermaids are BDSM dominas.

Attica Zoological Park is a member of the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA).And the European association of Aquatic mammals (EAAM). History The Attica Zoological Park opened in May 2000. It was initially a bird Park that was home to 1100 birds from 300 different species -- the 3rd largest bird collection in the world. World of reptiles was added in April 2001, followed by Greek fauna in 2002, the African Savannah exhibit (with zebras and giraffes) in 2003, a cat exhibit and expansion of the African Savannah exhibit in 2004, a monkey exhibit in 2005, Land of the Cheetah, a chimpanzee and gibbon exhibit, and a Somalia exhibit (with camels and donkeys) in 2008. In 2010, the zoo opened a dolphinarium and added white rhinos to its residents. Some of the animals of the park. Animals The zoo's big cats include lions and tigers, as well as black panthers and leopards. The zoo has several walk- through enclosures, including a \\"monkey's jungle\\". Shows In 2005, the zoo began to run daily shows featuring birds of prey. In 2010 the zoo began shows with its newly installed dolphinarium showing sea-lions and dolphins. The park have 7 dolphins : Veera (F), Leevi (M), Eevertti (M), Lima (M), Nojus (M), Ekinox (M) and Naska (M). The future Future plans include a museum of evolution with its primary focus on dinosaurs, called Dinosauropolis and an aquarium showing Greek marine life. Criticism In June 2010 the dolphinarium started working with shows by sea lions and dolphins. There were initially four dolphins bought from the Lithuanian Marine Institute, then seven more were added from the same source. The Greek Green Party took Attica Zoological Park to court claiming animal welfare issues in 2011. In April 2011, a Provisional Order was issued by the Athens Court temporarily prohibiting the operation of the dolphinarium. BBC has sent a correspondent to cover the story and the controversy has been presented in an article by author Lauren St John in The Sunday Times. In August 2011, the Greek court issued a decision declaring itself not competent to pass judgement on the case. Although the zoo claimed that the case in question has been decided permanently and that the company has been vindicated, this decision only addresses the ability of this particular court to decide the issue.

It is made by blending young (1-year-old) and old (2- to 3-year-old) lambics, which is bottled for a second fermentation. Because the young lambics are not fully fermented, the blended beer contains fermentable sugars, which allow a second fermentation to occur. Since gueuze is made by blending lambics, it tastes different from traditional ale and lager style beers. Because aged hops are used to produce these lambics, the beer has little to none of the traditional hop flavor and aroma that can be found in most other styles of beer. Furthermore, the wild yeasts that are specific to lambic-style beers give gueuze a dry, cider-like, musty, sour, acetic acid, lactic acid taste. Many describe the taste as sour and \\"barnyard-like\\". Because of its carbonation, gueuze is sometimes called \\"Brussels Champagne\\". In modern times, some brewers have added sweeteners such as aspartame to their gueuzes to sweeten them, trying to make the beer more appealing to a wider audience. The original, unsweetened version is often referred to as \\"Oude Gueuze\\" (\\"Old Gueuze\\") and became more popular in the early 2000s. Tim Webb, a British writer on Belgian and other beers, comments on the correct use of the term \\"'Oude gueuze' or 'oude geuze', now legally defined and referring to a drink made by blending two or more 100% lambic beer.\\"Webb, 2010, p.19 Traditionally, gueuze is served in champagne bottles, which hold either or . Traditionally, gueuze, and the lambics from which it is made, has been produced in the area known as Pajottenland and in Brussels. However, some non-Pajottenland/Brussels lambic brewers have sprung up and one or two also produce gueuze -- see table below. Gueuze (both 'Oude' and others) qualified for the European Union's designation 'TSG' (Traditional Speciality Guaranteed) in 1997/98 -- see Geographical indications and traditional specialities (EU).Webb, 2010, p.15 Etymology There is some debate on where the word gueuze originated. One theory is that it originated from Geysa (geyser), Old Norse for gush, as, during times of vigorous fermentation, Gueuze will spew out of the bunghole of its enclosing oak barrel. The most likely theory says that the name stems from the 'Geuzenstraat' (Geuzen Street) in Brussels where a lambic brewery was established. The story is that when the French under Napoleon occupied Belgium and thus Brussels, a lot of Champagne was drunk in Brussels. Champagne was something rather new in Brussels in those days and had become a real hype. This beverage came in strong glass bottles (most beer at the time was supplied in barrels). One brewer, situated in the Geuzenstraat, had the idea to collect the empty Champagne bottles and to refill them with what was called lambic beer. He added a bit of sugar for a second fermentation and re-sealed the bottles with a cork which was similar to the Champagne cork. By doing so, he hoped to benefit a bit from the Champagne hype. The new beer was a success and soon obtained the name \\"from the Geuzenstraat\\" or gueuze. The bigger gueuze bottles are still very similar to Champagne bottles today. Méthode Traditionnelle Some American craft breweries have begun blending young and old sour beers, to produce their own versions of the traditional gueuze. In 2016 Jester King Brewery released a blended, spontaneously fermented beer which it labelled as \\"Méthode Gueuze.\\" However, the High Council for Artisanal Lambic Beers (HORAL) objected to the name, and the two parties arranged a meeting in Belgium. It was agreed that in future the American brewers would use the designation \\"Méthode Traditionelle\\" as a style name.Food & Wine.

Development of the VAXstation 4000 Model 90 began in mid-1991. The workstation used the KA49-A CPU module containing a NVAX microprocessor operating at 74.43 MHz (14 ns cycle time) with a 256 KB external secondary cache. The NVAX had a 64-bit data bus to the NMC (NVAX Memory Controller) two gate array. The system module contained eight SIMM slots, and the workstation supported 16 to 128 MB of memory with parity. 16 MB MS44L-BC and 64 MB MS44-DC memory kits were used to populate the SIMM slots. Each memory kit contained four SIMMs with capacities of 4 MB and 16 MB respectively. The VAXstation 4000 Model 90 supported 3D graphics hardware, the SPXg and SPXgt options. These modules had their own connector on the system module. I/O was based around the NCA, a gate array which implemented an input/output adapter. The I/O subsystem had two independent 32-bit buses that communicated with the I/O and graphics options available. One of the buses interfaced to a TURBOchannel slot, the firmware contained within ROMs and the graphics options. The other bus interfaced to the Ethernet and EDAL controllers. EDAL was a 16-bit general-purpose bus for I/O. The EDAL controller consisted of a CEAC (CDAL-to-EDAL Chip) and a SQWF chip. Ethernet was provided by the SGEC (Second-Generation Ethernet Controller) chip. SCSI was provided by the NCR 53C94, which connected to the EDAL bus. Serial lines were provided by a DC7085 quad UART. The four serial lines were used for the keyboard, mouse, modem and printer/console. A 64-entry FIFO queue was provided for all four serial lines and was implemented by a small external SRAM.

A holder of the pass was entitled to unlimited use of the public transit system within a given period of time, with Cartes oranges being available for durations of one week or one month. The carte orange was discontinued in February 2009, and replaced by Navigo semaine (one-week pass) and Navigo mois (one-month pass) on a Navigo card. The Île-de-France region, with regards to public transportation, is divided in six concentric zones, the first one being the city of Paris. The most basic pass for Paris and its close banlieue covers zones 1–2, costing €17.20 for a one-week pass and €56.60 for a one-month pass. Description and use The Carte Orange itself is composed of a subway pass and an identity card, both of which are stored in a small, transparent, flexible plastic folder. The subway pass — a small, rectangular ticket composed mainly of stiff paper — lists the period of time and the zones for which it is valid, as well as its price. At the top of the front side of the ticket, there is a thin, holographic strip, to prevent counterfeiting. On the reverse side, there is a brown, magnetic strip on which the card's data (zones and dates) are stored. The user feeds the Carte orange ticket into a turnstile upon entering a metro station, and the machine, after reading the ticket, returns it to the user. A weekly Carte Orange is valid only for one seven-day period, always starting on Monday and ending on Sunday. The identity card is an attempt on the part of the public transit authorities to link each Carte Orange to one person, preventing multiple people from sharing one Carte Orange. The identity card features a space in which the user must print his or her full name and, in the lower left-hand corner, a space to which the user must affix a small, colour photograph of him or herself. On the back of the card, the user is required to fill out his or her full address. You must present a passport-size photo when purchasing the Carte Orange, and the ticket office worker affixes the photo to the ID card. Photo booths are often located near ticket offices. As an additional security measure, many Paris Métro turnstiles will not accept the same Carte orange ticket more than once in a short lapse of time. In the event that one accidentally exits a station prematurely (by following the wrong signs, for instance), it may be necessary to wait (usually only a few minutes) before re-using the ticket. The intention of this mechanism is to prevent multiple passengers from using a single Carte orange to enter an unmonitored metro entrance. When using the bus or tramway, the user does not validate his or her ticket electronically; rather, he or she shows the driver the identity card and the ticket, who then determines whether or not the Carte Orange is valid for the route. It is not possible to travel with a Carte Orange beyond the zones that the card is valid, and the transportation authority requires the travelers to purchase a ticket valid for the entire trip, regardless of the zones already covered by the carte orange. While some stations have special ticket windows that sell extensions for arriving passengers who need them (notably for tourists the Versailles station in Zone 4), others do not. This sometimes results in a traveller being stuck in the station until they can attract the attention of a metro employee, or jump the turnstile. The Charles de Gaulle Airport RER stop (located in Zone 5) is, unfortunately for tourists, one of those stations that does not have an accessible ticket window on the incoming side. Security features The Carte orange has several features intended to make fraud more difficult; the date of each carte's validity is printed in large characters, in 1997 the holographic strip was added, and a new kind of ink was introduced. Before the introduction of these new security features, it was estimated that 2.5% of all Cartes oranges were counterfeit. History Envelope of a carte orange The Carte orange was launched in 1975, at a time when fare collection for public transit in Paris and the surrounding region was very complicated — in fact, someone wanting to traverse Paris at the time might have had to buy five separate tickets. There had been several attempts to simplify ticketing in the Parisian public transport system in the past. Notably in 1968 a ticket valid for use in the bus and metro, the Ticket ivoire commun (common ivory ticket) was introduced and three years later a ticket valid in the SNCF, buses, metro and cars de banlieue was launched. Nevertheless, the Carte orange was novel in that it was the first ticket that gave the passenger unlimited access to all of the region's public transports for a flat rate, and during a specific period of time. a one-use ticket can be used in any form of the Paris public transit system. Initially, the Carte orange was only available to workers, who had to supply proof of employment in order to purchase it. This restriction was soon removed, however, and the Carte became very popular: while transit authorities had estimated that 650,000 Cartes oranges would be sold, within 6 months of its introduction 900,000 were in use. According to Michel Margairaz, a historian of Parisian transports, the gap between these figures can be explained due to a problem in the transit authorities' methodology — they assumed that only those public transit users who would save money with the Carte orange would buy one, but this was not to be the case. Many people were attracted to the idea of using Parisian public transports without worrying about tickets or fares, even if it proved to be more expensive. Public transit revenues, not only passenger convenience, were central concerns for the Carte's architects: according to Paul Josse, an official involved in the creation of the Carte orange, the new pass \\"couldn't cost the state or municipal governments a sou.\\" Furthermore, the RATP and the SNCF, respectively responsible for Île de France and national public transit, had to work out a revenue-sharing scheme, but this proved to be relatively easy. The Carte orange was also intended to boost the use of public transit, then in rapid decline, due to increasing use of cars. In fact, at the end of the 1960s, the transport ministry was actually considering abolishing bus service in Paris. However, within a year of the Carte's introduction, bus usage went up 40%, and more generally, it has been estimated that during the first ten years of its existence, the Carte led to an increase of 20% in the use of Parisian public transport. Finally, the Carte was intended to make fares more equitable; before the Carte's introduction, those who lived further from the city centre paid much more than more centrally located residents. While it seemed reasonable that those who wanted to travel further should pay more, many people who lived far from downtown Paris had to make many more connections as they travelled compared to others who travelled no further, connections for which they had to pay. The flat-rate system introduced by the Carte changed this. Phaseout The Carte orange has been phased out and replaced by the Navigo card. This new card contains a chip and is scanned at turnstiles, carries a photo of the user on the card itself, and may be linked to an account that the user has with the RATP. Thus, unlike the Carte orange, when a Navigo card is lost or stolen, it may be replaced (for a fee). The Carte orange was officially replaced by the Navigo card on May 20, 2008. The consequence of the phase out of the Carte orange is that it is more expensive for short-term visitors and tourists to take advantage of the maximum discounts available from advance bulk purchase of trips. This is because the Navigo card must either be linked to a French account (available to residents only) or purchased for a €5 fee (Carte Navigo Découverte).

He was a son of Ewan Christian, a deemster. In Manx, ' literally translates to Brown William—a name he received due to his dark hair, and in English he was called Brown-haired William.  Early years  Little is known about Dhone's early years. He is the third surviving son and youngest heir of Ewan Christian and his wife Katherine Harrison of Bankfield, Eastholme. Christian was an important political figure on the Isle of Man, holding the offices of deputy- governor of Peel Castle and deemster, a position he held for 51 years. Dhone was born at the family property in Derbyhaven at Ronaldsway in the parish of Malew in the south-east of the Isle of Man. The Derbyhaven farmhouse known as Ronaldsway House was demolished in the 1940s to accommodate the development of Ronaldsway Airport. Rise to prominence In 1648 the Lord of Mann, James Stanley, 7th Earl of Derby, appointed Christian as Receiver General. In 1651 the Earl went to England to fight for Charles II and Christian was left in command of the island militia. The Earl was taken prisoner at the Battle of Worcester, and his wife Charlotte de la Tremouille, who was residing on the Island, sought to obtain her husband's release by negotiating with the victorious parliamentarians for the surrender of the island. At once a revolt headed by Christian broke out, the Manx Rebellion of 1651, partly as a consequence of this step and partly due to discontent caused by some agrarian arrangements recently introduced by the Earl. The rebels seized many of the island forts and then Christian entered into negotiations with the parliamentarians. The island was soon in the power of Colonel Robert Duckenfield, who had brought the parliamentary fleet to Mann in October 1651. The Countess of Derby was compelled to surrender her two fortresses, Castle Rushen and Peel Castle, and Christian remained Receiver General. He then became Governor of the Isle of Man in 1656. Imprisonment and trial Two years later, however, Christian was accused of misappropriating money, although these charges were never substantiated. He fled to England, and in 1660 was arrested in London. After serving a year of imprisonment he returned to Mann, hoping that his offence against the Earl of Derby would be condoned under the Act of Indemnity of 1661; but, anxious to punish his conduct, Charles, the new Earl, ordered his seizure. At his trial, Christian refused to plead, and the House of Keys declared that his life and property were at the mercy of the Lord of Mann. The Deemsters then passed sentence, and Christian was executed by shooting at Hango Hill (near what is now Janet's Corner, Castletown), on 2 January 1663 on charges of high treason.Famed Manx Nationalist Remains Little Noted by Modern Officials, Cotton Boll Conspiracy, 28 May 2015 The execution was botched and he died of his injuries.http://www.isleofman.com/News/details/84916/illiam-dhone-day-2nd- january-2018 Aftermath and legacy This arbitrary act angered King Charles II and his advisers. The deemsters and others were punished, and some reparation was made to Christian's family. Christian is chiefly celebrated through the Manx ballad ', which has been translated into English by John Crellin in 1774 (and separately by George Borrow), and through the references to him in Sir Walter Scott's Peveril of the Peak. An annual commemoration is held by Mec Vannin and the Manx branch of the Celtic League at the spot of his execution. Dhone is a controversial figure in Manx history, some view him as a traitor, while others view him as a patriotic martyr who stood up for rights of the Manx people.https://www.culturevannin.im/news_story_1823.html The headquarters of the Office of Human Resources of the Isle of Man government is known as 'Illiam Dhone House'https://www.gov.im/hr/howtofindus.xml for now.

Messiah V was broadcast on BBC1 in January 2008. Starling is listed as series creator of the franchise. His second book, also a New York Times bestseller, and winner of the W. H. Smith 'Thumping Good Read' Award, was Storm. Set in Aberdeen, Storm begins with a ferry disaster, and follows the subsequent week in the life of Kate Beauchamp, one of the detectives from Messiah, as she tries to find a serial killer while her estranged father heads up the investigation into the ferry sinking. Starling changed tack substantially with his third novel. Vodka is a sprawling, epic story of Russia immediately after the end of the Soviet Union, and runs several storylines in tandem: the efforts of an American banker, Alice Liddell, to effect the first privatisation in Russian history; the battle between Slav and Chechen gangs for control of Moscow's vodka market; and the hunt for a serial killer who is killing children and draining their blood.Petit, Chris (2004) \\"Things go better with vodka\\", The Guardian, 20 March 2004, retrieved 2010-08-30 Another shift in period and location came with the publication of Starling's fourth novel, Visibility.

Assigned to investigate a suspicious drowning, detective Herbert Smith discovers that the victim, a young biochemist and son of a highly placed government official, had in the hours before his death claimed to be in possession of a discovery that could change the world. Visibility gained good reviews. The Guardian's Maxim Jakubowski called it \\"mystery at its best\\", while in the New Statesman Adam LeBor said: \\"Visibility is an intelligent and thought-provoking book, one that asks lingering questions about the very nature of loyalty and love.\\" Starling has also written a series of thrillers featuring Franco Patrese, a Pittsburgh homicide detective who later joins the FBI. The first book was published in the UK as 'Soul Murder' and in the US as 'Thou Shalt Kill.' The Pittsburgh Tribune- Review said that the book 'captures the essentials of Pittsburgh better than most natives could... This is a well-imagined thriller, a nice addition to the crowded police-procedural genre, with vivid characters and nimble-but-fitting plot twists.' The sequel, released as 'City Of Sins' in the UK in October 2011 and as 'City Of The Dead' in the US in April 2012, is set in New Orleans around the time of Hurricane Katrina.

It is an adaptation of the Earthsea novels by Ursula K. Le Guin. The teleplay was written by Gavin Scott, and the series was directed by Robert Lieberman. It was an American-Canadian co-production, filmed on-location in Vancouver, British Columbia. Combining the plots of the first and second novel, the story follows Ged (Shawn Ashmore), a powerful but reckless mage-in-training, and Tenar (Kristin Kreuk), a young priestess, who are drawn together in a battle against the ancient race of demons known as the Nameless Ones. The cast also stars Danny Glover, Isabella Rossellini, Sebastian Roché, and Chris Gauthier. The series aired over two consecutive nights in December 2004, and received generally negative reviews from both television critics and fans of the original novel, and was heavily criticized for its numerous deviations from the source material. However, it won seven Leo Awards and was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Visual Effects. Le Guin stated in interviews that she had been cut out of the creative process, and subsequently disowned the series.  Plot  In the land of Earthsea, a young wizard named Ged has visions about a girl and doors opening. Meanwhile, King Tygath wants to rule the land and release the Nameless Ones, demons from whom he hopes to learn the secret of immortality. He sends men to attack Ged's village, in search of the wizard of prophecy (Ged). Ged learns his first spell from an elderly woman. When the invasion comes, Ged uses a mist spell and lures the invaders over a cliff, saving the village. However, Ged also falls off the cliff. Tygath tries to convince High Priestess Thar to release the Nameless Ones, but she refuses. She is poisoned by Rosa, her attendant who has been tricked by the king's lover, Kossil, every time she has tea. A magus named Ogion arrives at Ged's village and revives Ged. He tells Ged his true name and takes him for training, but Ged is too impatient; he is sent to the magic school on Roke. There he meets the bully, Jasper, and befriends a student named Vetch. Ged shapeshifts into a hawk to show off. Jasper then challenges him to raise a spirit from the dead, leading him to accidentally release a Nameless One. The demon attacks Ged before being driven away by the Archmagus, who tells him that this Nameless One will hunt Ged down and try to possess him, using Ged's power for further destruction. Ged must go somewhere in hiding until he can find its true name and destroy it. With the help of Jasper, King Tygath takes control of the magic school. He throws a knife at the Archmagus, apparently killing him and making Jasper the new Archmagus. With the help of Ogion, Ged confronts the Gebbeth and attempts to drown him using a rock, however, it escapes with Ged's likeness and voice. Ged's impersonator becomes a murderer, and Vetch, a magus himself, chases Ged until he realizes Ged is not possessed by the Gebbeth and they decide to hunt it together. They are attacked by the dragon, Orm Embar, but Ged uses the dragon's true name to bind him and ask three questions. He wastes his first question, but with his second, he learns the Gebbeth's location. The dragon tells him where to find the two pieces of the Amulet of Peace, which when reunited would save Earthsea, but Ged could have asked the true name of the demon. Meanwhile, Thar appoints a successor, Tenar, and tells her the incantation to release the Nameless Ones. Kossil strangles Rosa and frames Tenar, leading to her imprisonment. Ged and Vetch return to Roke for help in decoding the dragon's riddle. The Archmagus survived Tygath's attack and made the real Jasper into a village fool as punishment. He sends Ged and Vetch to unseal the Nameless Tombs on Atuan, but Ged is captured and brought before Thar, who mistakes him for an evil wizard. In the labyrinth, Ged is locked in the cell next to Tenar. They break free and recognize each other from their visions. Thar realizes her mistake right before her death. Kossil tries to force Tenar to reveal the incantation and fails, so Tygath kills Kossil and follows Tenar to the gate of the Nameless Ones. Vetch finds the tomb first and is taken by the Gebbeth. Ged encounters Tygath in the labyrinth and fights him but then escapes into the tomb. He encounters the Gebbeth and realizes its true name is his own, because it is the darkness in himself. The demon is absorbed into Ged, making him whole again and strengthening him to strike Tygath in the tomb. Tygath forces Tenar to release the Nameless Ones with the incantation. The Nameless Ones are released and take Tygath into the sky before flying off. Ged reveals part of the key is the second half of the amulet. The Amulet of Peace is made whole, dispelling the Nameless Ones with a bright light and restoring peace to Earthsea. Ged is seen victorious with Tenar and they kiss.  Cast = Main characters  Supporting characters = Production  The series was produced by Hallmark Entertainment in association with Bender-Brown Productions. It was adapted by Gavin Scott (The Mists of Avalon) from the Earthsea novels for executive producers Robert Halmi, Sr. (Merlin, Gulliver's Travels, Animal Farm), Lawrence Bender (Kill Bill, Pulp Fiction) and Kevin Kelly Brown (Roswell). The series was filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.  Critical reception  Reviewing the miniseries, the book The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Fantasy claimed Legend of Earthsea \\"totally missed the point\\" of Le Guin's novels, \\"ripping out all the subtlety, nuance and beauty of the books and inserting boring cliches, painful stereotypes and a very unwelcome 'epic' war in their place\\". The Moria website's review of \\"Legend of Earthsea\\" states \\"Earthsea feels exactly like tv filler. In the books, Ursula Le Guin expended a great deal of time creating a world with a depth and culture, but nothing of this survives in the mini-series\\". The review also argues Legend of Earthsea \\"is shabbily and indifferently directed\\" and \\"The dialogue is dreadfully clunky and often excruciatingly bad\\".  Author's response  Le Guin, author of the novels on which the miniseries is based, was not involved in the development of the material or the making of the production. She has written a number of responses to the handling of this adaptation of her works, \\"A Whitewashed Earthsea\\" and \\"Frankenstein's Earthsea\\". She noted, \\"When I sold the rights to Earthsea a few years ago, my contract gave me the standard status of \\"consultant\\"—which means whatever the producers want it to mean, almost always little or nothing.,\\" and that, \\"Mr. Lieberman, one of the producers, published a statement telling people what 'Ursula' (whom he has never met) 'intended' by the books. That changed the situation. They were taking advantage of my silence by sticking words in my mouth. I put a reply on my website....\\" References External links  * * Ursula K.

It has a market capitalisation of PLN 1,346 trillion (EUR 319 billion; as of May 12, 2017). The WSE is a member of the Federation of European Securities Exchanges. On 17 December 2013, the WSE also joined the United Nations Sustainable Stock Exchanges (SSE) initiative. History Artus Court in Gdańsk was home to the oldest Polish mercantile exchange, established in the 14th century Old Town Hall, place of securities trading before the establishing of the Mercantile Exchange in 1817. Destroyed in 1817. Saxon Palace, the first seat of the Warsaw Exchange from 1817 to 1828. Destroyed in 1944 by the Germans. Bank of Poland and Exchange Building, home of the exchange from 1828 to 1876 Exchange Building, home of the exchange from 1877 until World War II. It was completely destroyed in the war. Centre of Banking and Finance, home of the WSE from 1991 to 2000. It was once the seat of the Polish United Workers' Party. =Kingdom of Poland= Warsaw became the capital and financial center of Poland in the early 17th century. In the Middle Ages other Polish towns, most of them members of the Hanse, were the leading economic centers of Poland. Merchants from western and southern Europe settled in Poland since the beginning of Polish statehood. They brought the system of organized exchange trading in securities, mostly bills and currencies, to Poland. The oldest Polish bill was issued in 1243 by the Cuyavien bishop Sambor. The main centers of securities tradings were at the lower Vistula, in the 14th century occupied by the Teutonic Knights. The first mercantile exchanges emerged in Gdańsk (1379), Toruń (1385), Malbork (14th century), Kraków (1405), Poznań (1429), Zamość (1590), Królewiec (1613) and Elbląg (1744). Mediaeval mercantile exchanges might have also existed for a short period in Chełmno, Grudziądz and Braniewo. =Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth= Early mercantile trade in securities emerged in Warsaw in the 15th and 16th century and was based on privileges by the Masovian Dukes and later Polish Kings. The original privileges are lost, but they have been mentioned and affirmed by King John II Casimir in 1658. An archetype of the Warsaw Exchange was first mentioned in 1624/1625. In 1643 Adam Zarzebski, the chief architect of King Władysław IV, mentioned a stone building on the Old Market Square as the seat of the Exchange, probably a part of the Old Town Hall. The securities trading minutes of the Warsaw merchants in the Old Town Hall have been recorded since 1757. The legal framework for the trading in securities was first codified by the Polish Sejm in 1775. As one of the first Polish corporations Kompania Manufaktur Welnianych issued its first 120 shares in 1768. The first Polish bonds were issued in 1782 by King Stanisław August. =Duchy of Warsaw= In 1808 the Duchy of Warsaw adopted the Napoleonic code including the Code de Commerce. The Code de Commerce also regulated stock exchange law and there were efforts made to establish a state-organized exchange on the basis of this code in Warsaw. However, due to the Napoleonic Wars and the Congress of Vienna, the plans had to be postponed. =Congress Poland= The first state-organized exchange in Poland, the Warsaw Mercantile Exchange (Giełda Kupiecka w Warszawie), was established in Warsaw by a decree of viceregent Grand Duke Constantine Romanov dated 12 May 1817. The first trading took place in the Old Town Hall on 16 May 1817 and moved in the same year to the Saxon Palace as the Old Town Hall was destroyed in the same year. Exchange trading in securities also was held in the trading house Marywil but were moved to the house of building of the Polish Central Bank in 1828 and to the building of the Financial Commission and Confraternity Harmonia in 1876, before in 1877 the Warsaw Mercantile Exchange moved into its own building at the Saxon Garden. The Warsaw Mercantile Exchange grew rapidly. The number of brokers doubled between 1817 and 1822. In the first half of the 19th century mainly bills, debentures and bonds were traded, while share trading on a broader scale developed in the second half of that century. The first public security to be traded on the Warsaw Mercantile Exchange was the debentures of Towarzystwo Kredytowe Ziemskie issued in 1826. The first shares admitted to trading were issued by railroad companies in the 1840s. Until 1853 trading sessions were twice a week between 1pm and 2pm. In 1873 a new, more liberal, stock exchange act was passed, separating the trade in securities and commodities. A separate Warsaw Commodities Exchange was founded in 1874. Central Europe was subject to a big bull market after the Prussian-Franco War of 1870-1871, followed by a harsh crash starting at the Vienna Stock Exchange in the later 1870s. However, the Warsaw Mercantile Exchange constantly grew until the First World War. In 1915 Warsaw was occupied by German and Austrian forces and the exchange was closed down during the later years of the war. =Second Polish Republic= The Warsaw Money Exchange (Giełda Pieniężna w Warszawie) was reopened after the First World War in 1919 and again in 1921. Between 1919 and 1939, the Warsaw Money Exchange was by far the largest of several bourses in different Polish cities (Katowice, Kraków, Lwów, Łódź, Poznań and Wilno), and accounted for 95% of the volume and 65 to 85% of the transactions traded on the Polish capital market. The Warsaw Money Exchange had more than 150 participants, 25 brokers, and more than 130 issuers. Its yearly turnover amounted to 1 billion PLZ. A new stock exchange law was passed in 1921 and again in 1926 and 1935. The Polish exchanges were subject to the world crises of 1929, but they recovered in the second half of the 1930s until the Second World War. In 1939 Poland was occupied by German and Russian forces and all Polish stock exchanges were closed by the aggressors. =Third Polish Republic= It was only after the fall of the communist regime in 1989, that the Warsaw Stock Exchange could be reestablished. Much needed experience and financial aid was provided by France (especially the Société des Bourses Françaises). The WSE began activity in its present form on 16 April 1991. On the first trading day only five stocks were listed (Tonsil, Próchnik, Krosno, Kable, and Exbud). Seven brokerages took part in the trading, and there were 112 buy and sell orders, with a turnover of only 1,990 złotys ($2,000). In the years 1991–2000, the stock exchange was in the building which during the previous, and then recent, communist years had been the seat of the Central Committee of the ruling Polish United Workers' Party. This can be considered an interesting reflection on the rapid transition of Poland from a communist to a market economy. Since then the WSE has been developing and growing rapidly and is now perceived as well established on the European market. In September 2008 the stock exchange was recognized as an \\"Advanced Emerging\\" exchange by FTSE, alongside markets from such countries as South Korea or Taiwan. On 29 September 2017, the index provider FTSE Russell has announced the results of the annual classification of markets. Polish market has been upgraded from Emerging Market to Developed Market status. Legal framework The legal framework for exchange operations is provided by three acts from 29 July 2005: * Act on Public Offering, Conditions Governing the Introduction of Financial Instruments to Organised Trading, and Public Companies * Act on Trading in Financial Instruments * Act on Capital Market Supervision Additionally, the WSE is governed by the Code of Commercial Companies of 2000, the Statutes of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, the Rules of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, and the Rules of the Stock Exchange Court. Structure and operations The WSE is a joint stock company founded by the State Treasury. The Treasury holds 35% share in capital. The following instruments are traded on the WSE: shares, bonds, subscription rights, allotments, and derivatives such as futures, options, and index participation units. Since its inception, the WSE has engaged in electronic trading. The WARSET trading platform has been in use from November 2000 to April 2013; it has been superseded by the UTP platform, based on the NYSE Euronext platform formerly having the same name. An additional market called NewConnect was introduced on 30 August 2007. The exchange has pre-market sessions from 08:00am to 09:00am, normal trading sessions from 09:00am to 04:50pm and post-market sessions from 04:50pm to 05:00pm on all days of the week except Saturdays, Sundays and holidays declared by the Exchange in advance.

It originally broadcast on 990 kHz, before switching to 1089 kHz, before switching to the FM band. The former Am frequency of 1089 was turned into a relay station of an automated Sydney station, and later purchased by Broadcast Operations Group. The station was founded in the mid-1930s. It was opened by the Postmaster General, Sen. McLachlan on the evening of 31 October 1935. The ceremony was actually performed in Sale, Victoria, as the Senator was performing a similar duty opening the new ABC regional station 3GI. The speech was relayed by landline to Orange. Contrary to popular thought, 2GZ was not the first to open west of the Blue Mountains as previously thought, that honour goes to 2MK at Bathurst, it opened in 1925 and closed in 1930/31. The original licensee of 2GZ was Country Broadcasting Services (later Country Television Services Ltd), who also launched CBN-8 Orange and CWN-6 Dubbo, now Prime Television, in the 1960s. The station converted to the FM band on October 8, 1999. Today the station broadcasts an Adult Contemporary/Classic Hits format, with a wide playlist of songs from the 1960s through to the 1990s and today, with a target demographic of 35–55 years. It was the Central West outlet for the John Laws morning show, as well as running its own breakfast program, similar to most of the former DMG-owned stations. It then ran the Charles Wooley morning show, sending Laws to 2EL. Ironically, 2GZ was once one of the regional stations that Laws worked at before becoming a national radio icon. In December, Macquarie severed ties with Charles Wooley, and was one of a handful of regional stations to take up a feed of Ray Hadley's 2GB radio show, commencing January 27. In late 2016 Southern Cross Austereo took over and rebranded the station, along with quite a few regional stations Triple M Central West.

Biography Miklós Glatter was the son of a vendor of the textile business company Brück & Grosz in Budapest. He was born in the 13th district quarter Újlipótváros of the Royal Hungarian capital city of Austria- Hungary. At birth, his twin brother was born dead and his mother died soon after childbirth. He spent most of his childhood years with his aunt's family whose husband Dezső Grosz was one of the owners of the textile company in which his father worked until his death in 1921. Radnóti attended primary and secondary school in his place of birth and continued his education at the high school for textile industry in Liberec from 1927–28 on his uncle's advice. Then he worked as commercial correspondent in the familiar textile business company until 1930. Ultimately, Radnóti was able to prevail with desire for another education and began studying philosophy, Hungarian and French language at the University of Szeged. In 1934, he finished his studies with the philosophical doctoral thesis The artistic development of Margit Kaffka. After graduation, he changed his name to Radnóti, after the birthplace Radnovce (Hungarian: Radnót) of his paternal grandfather. In August 1935, he married his long-standing love Fanny (1912-2014), daughter of the owner of the respected Gyarmati printing house. The very happy marriage was unfortunately childless until his deportation. In the school year of 1935-36 he gained first professional experiences as high school teacher at the Zsigmond Kemény Gymnasium in Budapest. In September 1940, he was conscripted to a Jewish labor battalion of the Hungarian Army until December of that year, then from July 1942 to April 1943 for the second time. On 2 May 1943, he converted together with his wife from Judaism to Roman Catholic faith. In May 1944, Radnóti's third military service started and his battalion was deported to Bor in Serbia. After 1943, Hungarian-Jewish forced laborers were imprisoned nearby Bor's copper mines which covered 50 percent of the copper requirement of the German war industry. On 17 September 1944, Radnóti, was forced to leave the camp in a column of about 3,600 prisoners because of the military offensive by Allied armies. He sustained the inhuman forced march from Bor to Szentkirályszabadja, where he wrote his last poem on 31 October. In November 1944, he and twenty other prisoners were shot and killed by members of the Hungarian Guards because of their total physical and mental exhaustion. Different dates of his death have been given. Some publications specify a day in the period from 6 to 10 November. In the detailed and scientific exhibition of 2009 by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, 4 November was said to be the date of death. Today it takes about 1 hour and 30 minutes to drive the 110 kilometers by car from Szentkirályszabadja to Abda. Radnóti is buried in the Kerepesi Cemetery with his wife. In 2013, his statue in Abda was damaged, but the reason for the damage has still not been clarified.Online catalogue of the Exhibition, Hungarian Academy of Sciences; retrieved 17 January 2018.Zsuzsanna Ozsváth, In the footsteps of Orpheus: the life and times of Miklós RadnótiIndiana University Press, Bloomington 2000; .Biographical Dictionary of Central and Eastern Europe in the Twentieth Century, Taylor & Francis, New York 2015; , Miklos Radnóti on Google Books, retrieved on 2018-01-17.Death Blows Overhead: The Last Transports from Hungary, November 1944, European Holocaust Research Infrastructure (EHRI); retrieved 17 January 2018.Article on Miklos Radnóti on the Website by the Poetry Foundation; retrieved 17 January 2018.Final Poem,Translation 1 on the Website The HyperTexts,Translation 2 on the Website by Hungarian Academy of Sciences; retrieved 17 January 2018.Grave of the spouses; retrieved 17 January 2018.The fate of the Radnóti statue in Abda, report on the Website Hungarian Spectrum, retrieved on 2018-01-19.

Ocean water differs in temperature and salinity. Warm surface water is generally saltier than the cooler deep or polar waters; in polar regions, the upper layers of ocean water are cold and fresh. Deep ocean water makes up about 90% of the volume of the oceans. Deep ocean water has a very uniform temperature, around 0-3°C, and a salinity of about 3.5% or as oceanographers state as 35 ppt (parts per thousand). In specialized locations such as the Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii NELHA ocean water is pumped to the surface from approximately 900 metres (3000 feet) deep for applications in research, commercial and pre-commercial activities. DOW is typically used to describe ocean water at sub-thermal depths sufficient to provide a measurable difference in water temperature. When deep ocean water is brought to the surface, it can be used for a variety of things. Its most useful property is its temperature. At the surface of the Earth, most water and air is well above 3 °C. The difference in temperature is indicative of a difference in energy. Where there is an energy gradient, skillful application of engineering can harness that energy for productive use by humans. The simplest use of cold water is for air conditioning: using the cold water itself to cool air saves the energy that would be used by the compressors for traditional refrigeration. Another use could be to replace expensive desalination plants. When cold water passes through a pipe surrounded by humid air, condensation results. The condensate is pure water, suitable for humans to drink or for crop irrigation. Via a technology called Ocean thermal energy conversion, the temperature difference can be turned into electricity. Cold- bed agriculture During condensation or Ocean thermal energy conservation operations, the water does not reach ambient temperature, because a certain temperature gradient is required to make these processes viable. The water leaving those operations is therefore still colder than the surroundings, and a further benefit can be extracted by passing this water through underground pipes, thereby cooling agricultural soil. This reduces evaporation, and even causes water to condense from the atmosphere. This allows agricultural production where crops would normally not be able to grow. This technique is sometimes referred to as \\"cold agriculture\\"West Hawaii Tech Pau Hana or \\"cold- bed agriculture\\".

He is best known as one of the founders of the Partisan air force, and served as an officer in No. 352 Squadron RAF.  Early life and career  Franjo Kluz was born in Jošik, near Bosanska Dubica. In 1931 he graduated from the Yugoslav reserve officers school as a sergeant-pilot. After the Axis invasion and establishment of Independent State of Croatia in 1941 he was drafted into the Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia and was stationed in Banja Luka. In the second half of May 1942, like Rudi Čajavec before him, he defected to the Partisans with his Potez 25 aircraft. From the improvised airfield near Prijedor he carried out a number of sorties against Axis forces, the most notable being the attack on an Ustaša column near Orahovo on 4 June. His plane was destroyed by hostile fire on 6 July. He then became a member of the Partisan command for Bosanska Krajina region. As a member of the command staff, he was required to be a Party member and on 14 August 1942 he was accepted as a member of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia. On 14 October Kluz became the station commander of the First Air Base of the Yugoslav National Liberation Army (YNLA) in Livno. After the German offensive, Kluz was sent, with 200 men, to Allied- controlled Italy, where they received training, equipment and aircraft from the RAF. Kluz was commissioned as a Pilot Officer in the RAFVR, with the service number 178171. Kluz became a member of the 1st Air Squadron of YNLA (Prva eskadrila, NOVJ), otherwise known as No. 352 Squadron RAF. On 14 September 1944, he was shot down in his Spitfire and killed KLUZ, FRANJA. Commonwealth War Graves Commission. by German AAA over Omiš. For his wartime service, Franjo Kluz was posthumously awarded the Order of a People's Hero of Yugoslavia.  Legacy  Franjo Kluz and Rudi Čajavec on a 1985 Yugoslavian stamp His unusual distinction of being 'an officer and a gentleman' in His Britannic Majesty's Royal Air Force whilst simultaneously being a member of the proletariat's Communist Party is, in reality, unlikely to be unique, but there will certainly be very few other RAF officers who have become a national Hero, whether of Yugoslavia, or any other country. A clothing factory in Belgrade was named in his honour. The company Kluz padobranihttp://www.kluzpadobrani.com/index.php?lang=1&pg;=2 makes parachutes to this day. A printing company in Omiš is also named after Kluz. An aero club in Zemun is also named in his honour. Streets in Skopje and in Novi Sad are also named after Kluz.

His inspiration was James Lackington's late 18th century \\"Temple of Muses\\" at Chiswell Street, London. The Foyle brothers were determined to create the greatest bookshop in the world. Foyles became increasingly popular with customers and members of the public throughout the world. In 1930, Foyle's nineteen-year-old daughter, Christina, brought together famous writers and distinguished figures, along with members of the public, to create the world's first public literary luncheon. During World War II, William Foyle purchased Beeleigh Abbey, a 12th-century monastery on the River Chelmer at Maldon, Essex. Although Foyle had collected books from an early age, it was at Beeleigh Abbey that he was able to house the books properly, forming one of the largest English private libraries of the 20th century. From 1963 to 1999 Christina Foyle lived at and maintained the Beeleigh estate. In July 2000 the library was sold at auction by Christie's auction house. The three day sale realised some £12,000,000, the most expensive item, a Medieval French work, selling for £883,750.Book and Magazine Collector, No. 198, September 2000, pp. 19-30. It was the single most valuable collection of books ever to be sold at auction in Britain or Europe.

It is an important passenger interchange station, opened in April 2011.Σε πορεία εξυγίανσης ο όμιλος ΟΣΕ Lines and Services The lines that converge in the junction are: *The main Piraeus–Platy railway line from Athens Central (Larissa station) to Oinoi , Chalcis and Thessaloniki. *The Athens Airport–Patras railway line connecting Athens International Airport and East Attica with the Athens Urban Area. As of 2019 the station is served by eight trains per day to Thessaloniki, one train per hour between the Airport and Ano Liosia, one train per hour between Koropi and Ano Liosia, and one train per 2 hours between Athens and Chalcis. Platforms The station has 8 platforms, as well as one low-level platform in the median of Attiki Odos Motorway. Currently, only this platform and two others are used. Future Usage of the 7 remaining platforms Apart from the 2 platforms on the Athens to Thessaloniki Line and the Proastiakos platform low level platform, the station has 6 platforms that remain unused. Those platforms exist in order to accommodate future services, especially after the completion of the P.A.Th.E./P.. *Platforms 1 and 2, which serve tracks 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively, will open after the completion of the Athens to Patras line.

The next sections are under construction (the link to the city of Patras is still under planning) and will open in stages from 2020 onwards. *Platforms 3 and 4 serve tracks 5, 6, 7 and 8. They will be used in case the Acharnes Bypass is completed. If completed, intercity and regional will be redirected through a tunnel, bypassing Acharnes, that will allow them to reach higher speeds, thus reducing travel times. Construction of this bypass seemed likely because the line north of Athens is expected to suffer from capacity issues and become a major bottleneck in the Greek Rail Network. Lack of finance as well as another proposal with the same goal, the Thriasion - Thiva Line have put this project on hold. *Platforms 5 and 6, which serve tracks 9, 10 and 11 are terminating platforms. Usage of these platforms is highly unlikely because extending services further from the station instead of having them terminate there is more favourable because of financial reasons, as well as the fact that they would attract more passengers. Metro Station A future station has been proposed on line 5 of the Athens Metro. It will not open before 2030. Criticism Low usage of the station and its unnecessarily large size and the number of platforms have led to the project being criticised as a white elephant.

Mitchell Madison Profile  Business The Mitchell Madison Group works with large corporations in the US, Asia, and Europe on a variety of performance improvement, analytics and strategy issues. Consistent with trends in the industry, MMG is working with Private Equity firm's portfolio companies on similar issues. Much of the consulting industry has shifted its focus on servicing Private Equity clients, due to their higher level of motivation to improve earnings and their experience with management consultants. In fact, the Private Equity governance model depends on fast performance improvement to add value quickly. HBR Secret of Private Equity In any large corporation, getting, say $10M in earnings improvement does not provide sufficient motivation for management to overcome organizational or political obstacles. In a Private Equity owned company, however, $10M EBITDA is equivalent to 10x or more in equity value upon exit, hence the higher level of motivation. MMG is a functional specialist, as opposed to being focussed on particular client industries, having served the tech, telecom, banking, insurance, entertainment, healthcare, business services, and manufacturing industries. Consistent with a resurgence of manufacturing in the US and globally, the firm frequently assists major manufacturing companies with cost reduction initiatives. PR News Wire on MMG Much of the work is global strategic sourcing, which is becoming more important as manufacturers seek to diversify their global supply chain in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Sourcing In Turbulent Times  Recruiting The Mitchell Madison Group is hiring various positions in the US and recruits on campus at major universities. Careers at MMG MMG's recruiting strategy is more focussed on demonstrated problem-solving skills, intelligence and creativity than on past business experience.

Biography Véron originally made his fortune from patent medicines. In 1829 he founded the literary magazine Revue de Paris, and from 1838 to 1852 was owner and director of Le Constitutionnel, in which he published Eugene Sue's novel based on the legend of the Wandering Jew. It was also during Véron's direction and at his suggestion that Sainte-Beuve contributed the Causeries du lundi, an early example of the regular newspaper column. He is largely known to history for his direction, from 1831-1835, of the Paris Opera. The new government, after the July Revolution of 1830, wished to offload the costs and responsibilities of the Opera, which had been effectively state-controlled since its inception. Véron saw the great potential of adapting the Opera to the bourgeois tastes of new audiences and applied for the franchise, which brought with it limited State subsidy. By bringing together the talents of designers (such as Duponchel), composers (such as Meyerbeer, Auber and Fromental Halévy), and librettists (such as Eugene Scribe and Casimir Delavigne), and developing great singers such as Adolphe Nourrit and Cornélie Falcon, he created the genre of Grand Opera. The first new production under Véron's management, Meyerbeer's Robert le diable (21 November 1831) began a new era in opera. When the government decided to further reduce subsidy of the Opera in 1835, Véron prudently withdrew, having made a substantial profit. In 1852 Véron was elected to the Corps Législatif (the predecessor of the Chamber of Deputies). His Memoires d'un bourgeois de Paris (1853–1855) give a lively picture of his life and times. Sketch of Louis Véron Véron was eccentric in his appearance and behaviour. A contemporary, Philarete Chasles, describes him as follows: > Ruddy, with a pock-marked face, barely any nose, scrofulous, his neck > enfolded in cloth that protected and hid his affliction, pot-bellied; [...] > mouth smiling, lips thick, hair rare, eyebrows absent, dressed like a little > lackey aping his master and with the affectations and the mincing airs of > the salon (quoted in Kelly, 2004 – see below).

He is the only fencer to win a gold medal in each of the three weapons at a single Olympic Games and won the most fencing gold medals ever at a single Games—five. Nadi won six Olympic gold medals in total. Biography=Early life= Nedo Nadi was born in Livorno, Italy, the elder son of famous Italian fencing master, Giuseppe (Beppe) Nadi. He had a younger brother, Aldo who was an Olympic gold medallist in his own right. Nedo had his first fencing lesson with a foil at the age of seven in his father’s gymnasium at Livorno. His father taught him foil and sabre but believed the épée to be an \\"undisciplined\\" weapon and refused to teach it. The brothers therefore used to go and practice by themselves and were essentially self-taught. At the age of fourteen Nedo won a solid silver trophy for his three weapon work during the Jubilee celebration of Emperor Franz Joseph at Vienna. =1912 Olympic Games= Competing for his country at 1912 Stockholm Olympics, Nadi became the youngest fencer to win a foil gold medal. Aged 18 years and 29 days, he beat teammate Pietro Speciale and Richard Verderber of Austria for the individual gold with seven straight victories in the final pool. =World War I= Nadi served in the Italian Army during World War I and was decorated for bravery. =1920 Olympic Games= Nadi resumed his competitive career after World War I was over. Defeated central European countries and the Soviet Union did not attend the Antwerp games. This meant that Hungary, one of the strongest fencing nations, would be absent. Nadi therefore decided to expand his chances for gold and entered all three fencing disciplines. Nedo Nadi’s 1920 Olympic performances were acclaimed as near to perfection as a fencer could execute. Nadi won the individual foil gold medal with a record 10 wins in the final pool. Frenchman, Roger Ducret, who won bronze went on to win the individual gold in 1924, after Nadi had retired from the Olympic arena. Nadi’s entry in the épée event annoyed his father, who regarded the épée as \\"a crude and undisciplined weapon”. Unlike the foil, where a fencer could only score off a hit which landed on the trunk of the opponent’s body, or the sabre where the upper torso and face mask count as scoring hits, in épée any part of the body is a legitimate hit. Nevertheless, Nedo Nadi led the Italian épée team, which included his brother Aldo, to the Olympic team gold medal. Nedo Nadi's perfect balance, timing and rapid reflexes were an advantage in any style of fencing, so without much difficulty he won the individual sabre gold medal by 11 victories to 9. His brother Aldo won the silver medal. In the team sabre event, the Italian team supported their star fencer and cruised to an easy victory. Nadi, carried in triumph by his opponents, added three team victories to his tally of two individual golds and his younger brother Aldo won three team gold and one silver to make the family total a record for any sport in one Olympic Games. =Later life= Aldo and Nedo only fenced each other once in public and that match was drawn. Aldo moved to Hollywood where he worked in the film industry. After his Antwerp Olympic victories Nadi turned professional and took up coaching at the Buenos Aires Jockey Club. He returned to Rome some years later and was reinstated as an amateur. From 1935 to his death in January 1940 he served as president of the Italian Fencing Federation.

Nursing theories frame, explain or define the practice of nursing. Roy's model sees the individual as a set of interrelated systems (biological, psychological and social). The individual strives to maintain a balance between these systems and the outside world, but there is no absolute level of balance. Individuals strive to live within a unique band in which he or she can cope adequately. Overview of the theory This model comprises the four domain concepts of person, health, environment, and nursing; it also involves a six-step nursing process. Andrews & Roy (1991) state that the person can be a representation of an individual or a group of individuals. Roy's model sees the person as \\"a biopsychosocial being in constant interaction with a changing environment\\". The person is an open, adaptive system who uses coping skills to deal with stressors. Roy sees the environment as \\"all conditions, circumstances and influences that surround and affect the development and behaviour of the person\\". Roy describes stressors as stimuli and uses the term residual stimuli to describe those stressors whose influence on the person is not clear. Originally, Roy wrote that health and illness are on a continuum with many different states or degrees possible. More recently, she states that health is the process of being and becoming an integrated and whole person. Roy's goal for nursing is \\"the promotion of adaptation in each of the four modes, thereby contributing to the person's health, quality of life and dying with dignity\\". These four modes are physiological, self-concept, role function and interdependence. Roy employs a six-step nursing process: assessment of behaviour; assessment of stimuli; nursing diagnosis; goal setting; intervention and evaluation. In the first step, the person's behaviour in each of the four modes is observed. This behaviour is compared with norms and is deemed either adaptive or ineffective. The second step is concerned with factors that influence behaviour. Stimuli are classified as focal, contextual or residual. The nursing diagnosis is the statement of the ineffective behaviours along with the identification of the probable cause. This is typically stated as the nursing problem related to the focal stimuli, forming a direct relationship. In the fourth step, goal setting is the focus. Goals need to be realistic and attainable and are set in collaboration with the person. There are usually both short term and long term goals that the nurse sets for the patient. Intervention occurs as the fifth step, and this is when the stimuli are manipulated. It is also called the 'doing phase' . In the final stage, evaluation takes place. The degree of change as evidenced by change in behaviour, is determined. Ineffective behaviours would be reassessed, and the interventions would be revised. The model had its inception in 1964 when Roy was a graduate student. She was challenged by nursing faculty member Dorothy E. Johnson to develop a conceptual model for nursing practice. Roy's model drew heavily on the work of Harry Helson, a physiologic psychologist. The Roy adaptation model is generally considered a \\"systems\\" model; however, it also includes elements of an \\"interactional\\" model. The model was developed specifically for the individual client, but it can be adapted to families and to communities (Roy, 1983). Roy states (Clements and Roberts, 1983) that \\"just as the person as an adaptive system has input, output. and internal processes so too the family can be described from this perspective.\\" Basic to Roy's model are three concepts: the human being, adaptation, and nursing. The human being is viewed as a biopsychosocial being who is continually interacting with the environment. The human being's goal through this interaction is adaptation. According to Roy and Roberts (1981, p. 43), ‘The person has two major internal processing subsystems, the regulator and the cognator.\\" These subsystems are the mechanisms used by human beings to cope with stimuli from the internal and external environment. The regulator mechanism works primarily through the autonomic nervous system and includes endocrine, neural, and perception pathways. This mechanism prepares the individual for coping with environmental stimuli. The cognator mechanism includes emotions, perceptual/information processing, learning, and judgment. The process of perception bridges the two mechanisms (Roy and Roberts, 1981). Types of Stimuli *Three types of stimuli influence an individual's ability to cope with the environment. These include focal stimuli, contextual stimuli, and residual stimuli. Focal stimuli are those that immediately confront the individual in a particular situation. Focal stimuli for a family include individual needs; the level of family adaptation; and changes within the family members, among the members and in the family environment (Roy, 1983). Contextual stimuli are those other stimuli that influence the situation. Residual stimuli include the individual's beliefs or attitudes that may influence the situation. Many times this is the nurse's \\"hunch\\" about other factors that can affect the problem. Contextual and residual stimuli for a family system include nurturance, socialization, and support (Roy, 1983). Adaptation occurs when the total stimuli fall within the individual's/family's adaptive capacity, or zone of adaptation. The inputs for a family include all of the stimuli that affect the family as a group. The outputs of the family system are three basic goals: survival, continuity, and growth (Roy, 1983). Roy states (Clements and Roberts, 1983): *Since adaptation level results from the pooled effect of all other relevant stimuli, the nurse examines the contextual and residual stimuli associated with the focal stimulus to ascertain the zone within which positive family coping can take place and to predict when the given stimulus is outside that zone and will require nursing intervention. Four Modes of Adaptation Levine believes that an individual's adaptation occurs in four different modes. This also holds true for families (Hanson, 1984). These include the physiologic mode, the self-concept mode, the role function mode, and the interdependence mode. The individual's regulator mechanism is involved primarily with the physiologic mode, whereas the cognator mechanism is involved in all four modes (Roy and Roberts, 1981). The family goals correspond to the model's modes of adaptation: survival = physiologic mode; growth = self-concept mode; continuity = role function mode. Transactional patterns fall into the interdependence mode (Clements and Roberts, 1983). In the physiologic mode, adaptation involves the maintenance of physical integrity. Basic human needs such as nutrition, oxygen, fluids, and temperature regulation are identified with this mode (Fawcett, 1984). In assessing a family, the nurse would ask how the family provides for the physical and survival needs of the family members. A function of the self-concept mode is the need for maintenance of psychic integrity. Perceptions of one's physical and personal self are included in this mode. Families also have concepts of themselves as a family unit. Assessment of the family in this mode would include the amount of understanding provided to the family members, the solidarity of the family, the values of the family, the amount of companionship provided to the members, and the orientation (present or future) of the family (Hanson, 1984). The need for social integrity is emphasized in the role function mode. When human beings adapt to various role changes that occur throughout a lifetime, they are adapting in this mode. According to Hanson (1984), the family's role can be assessed by observing the communication patterns in the family. Assessment should include how decisions are reached, the roles and communication patterns of the members, how role changes are tolerated, and the effectiveness of communication (Hanson, 1984). For example, when a couple adjusts their lifestyle appropriately following retirement from full-time employment, they are adapting in this mode. The need for social integrity is also emphasized in the interdependence mode. Interdependence involves maintaining a balance between independence and dependence in one's relationships with others. Dependent behaviors include affection seeking, help seeking, and attention seeking. Independent behaviors include mastery of obstacles and initiative taking. According to Hanson (1984), when assessing this mode in families, the nurse tries to determine how successfully the family lives within a given community. The nurse would assess the interactions of the family with the neighbors and other community groups, the support systems of the family, and the significant others (Hanson, 1984). The goal of nursing is to promote adaptation of the client during both health and illness in all four of the modes. Actions of the nurse begin with the assessment process, The family is assessed on two levels. First, the nurse makes a judgment with regard to the presence or absence of maladaptation. Then, the nurse focuses the assessment on the stimuli influencing the family's maladaptive behaviors. The nurse may need to manipulate the environment, an element or elements of the client system, or both in order to promote adaptation. Many nurses, as well as schools of nursing, have adopted the Roy adaptation model as a framework for nursing practice. The model views the client in a holistic manner and contributes significantly to nursing knowledge. The model continues to undergo clarification and development by the author. Applying Roy’s Model to Family Assessment When using Roy's model as a theoretical framework, the following can serve as a guide for the assessment of families. *I. Adaptation Modes **A. Physiologic Mode ***1. To what extent is the family able to meet the basic survival needs of its members? ***2. Are any family members having difficulty meeting basic survival needs? **B. Self-Concept Mode ***1. How does the family view itself in terms of its ability to meet its goals and to assist its members to achieve their goals? To what extent do they see themselves as self- directed? Other directed? ***2. What are the values of the family? ***3. Describe the degree of companionship and understanding given to the family members **C. Role Function Mode ***1. Describe the roles assumed by the family members. ***2. To what extent are the family roles supportive, in conflict, reflective of role overload? ***3. How are family decisions reached? **D. Interdependence Mode ***1. To what extent are family members and subsystems within the family allowed to be independent in goal identification and achievement (e.g., adolescents)? ***2. To what extent are the members supportive of one another? ***3. What are the family's support systems? Significant others? ***4. To what extent is the family open to information and assistance from outside the family unit? Willing to assist other families outside the family unit? ***5. Describe the interaction patterns of the family In the community. *II. Adaptive Mechanisms **A. Regulator: Physical status of the family in terms of health? i.e., nutritional state, physical strength, availability of physical resources **B. Cognator: Educational level, knowledge base of family, source of decision making, power base, degree of openness in the system to input, ability to process *III. Stimuli **A. Focal ***1. What are the major concerns of the family at this time? ***2. What are the major concerns of the individual members? ***3. This is usually related to the nursing diagnoses or the main stimuli causing the problem behaviors. It is important for the nurse to try to fix this before they can fix the problem behaviors as they are related to each other. **B. Contextual ***1. What elements in the family structure, dynamic, and environment are impinging on the manner and degree to which the family can cope with and adapt to their major concerns (i.e., financial and physical resources, presence or absence of support systems, clinical setting and so on)? ***These can be either negative or positive as it relates to the main nursing problem. **C. Residual ***1. What knowledge, skills, beliefs, and values of this family must be considered as the family attempts to adapt (i.e., stage of development, cultural background, spiritual/religious beliefs, goals, expectations)? This is normally an assumption that the nurse has that could impact care. One could describe it as one's educational guess about something going on in the patient's life that could be further contributing to the problem. The nurse assesses the degree to which the family's actions in each mode are leading to positive coping and adaptation to the focal stimuli. If coping and adaptation are not health promoting, assessment of the types of stimuli and the effectiveness of the regulators provides the basis for the design of nursing interventions to promote adaptation. By answering each of these questions in each assessment, a nurse can have a full understanding of the problem's a patient may be having. It is important to recognize each stimuli because without it, not every aspect of the person's problem can be confronted and fixed. As a nurse, it is their job to recognize all of these modes, mechanisms, and stimuli while taking care of a patient. They do so through the use of their advanced knowledge of the nursing process as well as with interviews with the individuals and the family members. Callista Roy maintains there are four main adaptation systems, which she calls modes of adaptation. She calls these the 1\\\\. the physiological - physical system 2\\\\. the self- concept group identity system 3\\\\. the role mastery/function system 4\\\\. the interdependency system.

Introduction In contrast to the Banach space case, in which the invertibility of the derivative at a point is sufficient for a map to be locally invertible, the Nash–Moser theorem requires the derivative to be invertible in a neighborhood. The theorem is widely used to prove local existence for non-linear partial differential equations in spaces of smooth functions. It is particularly useful when the inverse to the derivative \\"loses\\" derivatives, and therefore the Banach space implicit function theorem cannot be used. History The Nash-Moser theorem traces back to , who proved the theorem in the special case of the isometric embedding problem. It is clear from his paper that his method can be generalized. , for instance, showed that Nash's methods could be successfully applied to solve problems on periodic orbits in celestial mechanics in the KAM theory. However, it has proven quite difficult to find a suitable general formulation; there is, to date, no all-encompassing version; various versions due to Gromov, Hamilton, Hörmander, Moser, Saint-Raymond, Schwartz, and Sergeraert are given in the references below. That of Hamilton's, quoted below, is particularly widely cited. The problem of loss of derivatives This will be introduced in the original setting of the Nash-Moser theorem, that of the isometric embedding problem. Let \\\\Omega be an open subset of \\\\mathbb{R}^n. Consider the map :P:C^1(\\\\Omega;\\\\mathbb{R}^N)\\\\to C^0\\\\big(\\\\Omega;\\\\text{Sym}_{n\\\\times n}(\\\\mathbb{R})\\\\big) given by :P(f)_{ij}=\\\\sum_{\\\\alpha=1}^N\\\\frac{\\\\partial f^\\\\alpha}{\\\\partial u^i}\\\\frac{\\\\partial f^\\\\alpha}{\\\\partial u^j}. In Nash's solution of the isometric embedding problem (as would be expected in the solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations) a major step is a statement of the schematic form \\"If f is such that P(f) is positive-definite, then for any matrix-valued function g which is close to P(f), there exists fg with P(fg)=g.\\" Following standard practice, one would expect to apply the Banach space inverse function theorem. So, for instance, one might expect to restrict P to C5(Ω;ℝN) and, for an immersion f in this domain, to study the linearization C5(Ω;ℝN)→C4(Ω;Symn×n(ℝ)) given by :\\\\widetilde{f}\\\\mapsto \\\\sum_{\\\\alpha=1}^N \\\\frac{\\\\partial f^\\\\alpha}{\\\\partial u^i}\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\widetilde{f}^\\\\beta}{\\\\partial u^j}+\\\\sum_{\\\\alpha=1}^N \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\widetilde{f}^\\\\alpha}{\\\\partial u^i}\\\\frac{\\\\partial f^\\\\beta}{\\\\partial u^j}. If one could show that this were invertible, with bounded inverse, then the Banach space inverse function theorem directly applies. However, there is a deep reason that such a formulation cannot work. The issue is that there is a second-order differential operator of P(f) which coincides with a second-order differential operator applied to f. To be precise: if f is an immersion then :R^{P(f)}=H(f)^2-h(f)_{P(f)}^2, where RP(f) is the scalar curvature of the Riemannian metric P(f), H(f) denotes the mean curvature of the immersion f, and h(f) denotes its second fundamental form; the above equation is the Gauss equation from surface theory. So, if P(f) is C4, then RP(f) is generally only C2. Then, according to the above equation, f can generally be only C4; if it were C5 then H2-h2 would have to be at least C3. The source of the problem can be quite succinctly phrased in the following way: the Gauss equation shows that there is a differential operator Q such that the order of the composition of Q with P is less than the sum of the orders of P and Q. In context, the upshot is that the inverse to the linearization of P, even if it exists as a map C∞(Ω;Symn×n(ℝ))→C∞(Ω;ℝN), cannot be bounded between appropriate Banach spaces, and hence the Banach space implicit function theorem cannot be applied. By exactly the same reasoning, one cannot directly apply the Banach space implicit function theorem even if one uses the Hölder spaces, the Sobolev spaces, or any of the Ck spaces. In any of these settings, an inverse to the linearization of P will fail to be bounded. This is the problem of loss of derivatives. A very naive expectation is that, generally, if P is an order k differential operator, then if P(f) is in Cm then f must be in Cm+k. However, this is somewhat rare. In the case of uniformly elliptic differential operators, the famous Schauder estimates show that this naive expectation is borne out, with the caveat that one must replace the Ck spaces with the Hölder spaces Ck,α; this causes no extra difficulty whatsoever for the application of the Banach space implicit function theorem. However, the above analysis shows that this naive expectation is not borne out for the map which sends an immersion to its induced Riemannian metric; given that this map is of order 1, one does not gain the \\"expected\\" one derivative upon inverting the operator. The same failure is common in geometric problems, where the action of the diffeomorphism group is the root cause, and in problems of hyperbolic differential equations, where even in the very simplest problems one does not have the naively expected smoothness of a solution. All of these difficulties provide common contexts for applications of the Nash-Moser theorem. The schematic form of Nash's solution This section only aims to describe an idea, and as such it is intentionally imprecise. For concreteness, suppose that P is an order-one differential operator on some function spaces, so that it defines a map P:Ck+1→Ck for each k. Suppose that, at some Ck+1 function f, the linearization DPf:Ck+1→Ck has a right inverse S:Ck→Ck; in the above language this reflects a \\"loss of one derivative\\". One can concretely see the failure of trying to use Newton's method to prove the Banach space implicit function theorem in this context: if g∞ is close to P(f) in Ck and one defines the iteration :f_{n+1}=f_n+S\\\\big(g_\\\\infty-P(f_n)\\\\big), then f1∈Ck+1 implies that g∞-P(fn) is in Ck, and then f2 is in Ck. By the same reasoning, f3 is in Ck-1, and f4 is in Ck-2, and so on. In finitely many steps the iteration must end, since it will lose all regularity and the next step will not even be defined. Nash's solution is quite striking in its simplicity. Suppose that for each t>0 one has a smoothing operator θt which takes a Cn function, returns a smooth function, and approximates the identity when t is large. Then the \\"smoothed\\" Newton iteration :f_{n+1}=f_n+S\\\\big(\\\\theta_n(g_\\\\infty-P(f_n))\\\\big) transparently does not encounter the same difficulty as the previous \\"unsmoothed\\" version, since it is an iteration in the space of smooth functions which never loses regularity. So one has a well-defined sequence of functions; the major surprise of Nash's approach is that this sequence actually converges to a function f∞ with P(f∞)=g∞. For many mathematicians, this is rather surprising, since the \\"fix\\" of throwing in a smoothing operator seems too superficial to overcome the deep problem in the standard Newton method. For instance, on this point Mikhael Gromov says Remark. The true \\"smoothed Newton iteration\\" is a little more complicated than the above form, although there are a few inequivalent forms, depending on where one chooses to insert the smoothing operators. The primary difference is that one requires invertibility of DPf for an entire open neighborhood of choices of f, and then one uses the \\"true\\" Newton iteration, corresponding to (using single-variable notation) :x_{n+1}=x_n-\\\\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)} as opposed to :x_{n+1}=x_n-\\\\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_0)}, the latter of which reflects the forms given above. This is rather important, since the improved quadratic convergence of the \\"true\\" Newton iteration is significantly used to combat the error of \\"smoothing,\\" in order to obtain convergence. Certain approaches, in particular Nash's and Hamilton's, follow the solution of an ordinary differential equation in function space rather than an iteration in function space; the relation of the latter to the former is essentially that of the solution of Euler's method to that of a differential equation. Hamilton's formulation of the theorem The following statement appears in : :Let F and G be tame Fréchet spaces, let U⊂F be an open subset, and let P:U\\\\rightarrow G be a smooth tame map. Suppose that for each f\\\\in U the linearization dP_f:F\\\\to G is invertible, and the family of inverses, as a map U\\\\times G\\\\to F, is smooth tame. Then P is locally invertible, and each local inverse P^{-1} is a smooth tame map. Similarly, if each linearization is only injective, and a family of left inverses is smooth tame, then P is locally injective. And if each linearization is only surjective, and a family of right inverses is smooth tame, then P is locally surjective with a smooth tame right inverse. =Tame Fréchet spaces= A graded Fréchet space consists of the following data: * a vector space F * a countable collection of seminorms \\\\\\\\cdot\\\\_n:F\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R} such that ::\\\\f\\\\_0\\\\leq\\\\f\\\\_1\\\\leq\\\\f\\\\_2\\\\leq\\\\cdots :for all f\\\\in F. One requires these to satisfy the following conditions: :* if f\\\\in F is such that \\\\f\\\\_n=0 for all n=0,1,2,\\\\ldots then f=0 :* if f_j\\\\in F is a sequence such that, for each n=0,1,2,\\\\ldots and every \\\\varepsilon>0 there exists N_{n,\\\\varepsilon} such that j,k>N_{n,\\\\varepsilon} implies \\\\f_j- f_k\\\\_n<\\\\varepsilon, then there exists f\\\\in F such that, for each n, one has :::\\\\lim_{j\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\f_j-f\\\\_n=0. Such a graded Fréchet space is called tame if it satisfies the following condition: * there exists a Banach space B and linear maps L:F→Σ(B) and M:Σ(B)→F such that M is a right inverse of L, and such that: :* there exists r and b such that for each n>b there is a number Cn such that :::\\\\sup_{k\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N}}e^{nk}\\\\L(f)_k\\\\_B\\\\leq C_n\\\\f\\\\_{r+n} ::for every f∈F, and :::\\\\M(\\\\\\\\{x_i\\\\\\\\})\\\\_n\\\\leq C_n\\\\sup_{k\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N}}e^{(r+n)k}\\\\x_k\\\\_B ::for every {xi}∈Σ(B). Here Σ(B) denotes the vector space of exponentially decreasing sequences in B, i.e. :\\\\Sigma(B)=\\\\Big\\\\\\\\{\\\\text{maps }x:\\\\mathbb{N}\\\\to B\\\\text{ s.t. }\\\\sup_{k\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N}}e^{nk}\\\\x_k\\\\_B<\\\\infty\\\\text{ for all }n\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N}\\\\Big\\\\\\\\}. The laboriousness of the definition is justified by the primary examples of tamely graded Fréchet spaces: * If M is a compact smooth manifold (with or without boundary) then C∞(M) is a tamely graded Fréchet space, when given any of the following graded structures: :* take \\\\f\\\\_n to be the Cn-norm of f :* take \\\\f\\\\_n to be the Cn,α-norm of f for fixed α :* take \\\\f\\\\_n to be the Wn,p-norm of f for fixed p * If M is a compact smooth manifold-with-boundary then C0∞(M), the space of smooth functions whose derivatives all vanish on the boundary, is a tamely graded Fréchet space, with any of the above graded structures. * If M is a compact smooth manifold and V→M is a smooth vector bundle, then the space of smooth sections is tame, with any of the above graded structures. To recognize the tame structure of these examples, one topologically embeds M in a Euclidean space, B is taken to be the space of L1 functions on this Euclidean space, and the map L is defined by dyadic restriction of the Fourier transform. The details are in pages 133-140 of Hamilton's article. Presented directly as above, the meaning and naturality of the \\"tame\\" condition is rather obscure. The situation is clarified if one re-considers the basic examples given above, in which the relevant \\"exponentially decreasing\\" sequences in Banach spaces arise from restriction of a Fourier transform. Recall that smoothness of a function on Euclidean space is directly related to the rate of decay of its Fourier transform. \\"Tameness\\" is thus seen as a condition which allows an abstraction of the idea of a \\"smoothing operator\\" on a function space. Given a Banach space B and the corresponding space Σ(B) of exponentially decreasing sequences in B, the precise analogue of a smoothing operator can be defined in the following way. Let s:ℝ→ℝ be a smooth function which vanishes on (-∞,0), is identically equal to one on (1,∞), and takes values only in the interval [0,1]. Then for each real number t define θt:Σ(B)→Σ(B) by :(\\\\theta_tx)_i=s(t-i)x_i. If one accepts the schematic idea of the proof devised by Nash, and in particular his use of smoothing operators, the \\"tame\\" condition then becomes rather reasonable. =Smooth tame maps= Let F and G be graded Fréchet spaces. Let U be an open subset of F, meaning that for each f in U there is n and ε>0 such that f1n<ε implies that f1 is also contained in U. Let P:U→G be a smooth map. One says that it is tame if for all k∈ℕ the derivative DkP:U×F×⋅⋅⋅×F→G satisfies the following: * there exists r and b such that n>b implies ::\\\\big\\\\D^kP(f,h_1,\\\\ldots,h_k)\\\\big\\\\_n\\\\leq C_n\\\\Big(\\\\f\\\\_{n+r}+\\\\h_1\\\\_{n+r}+\\\\cdots+\\\\h_k\\\\_{n+r}+1\\\\Big) :for all (f,h1,...,hk)∈U×F×⋅⋅⋅×F. The fundamental example says that, on a compact smooth manifold, a nonlinear partial differential operator (possibly between sections of vector bundles over the manifold) is a smooth tame map; in this case, r can be taken to be the order of the operator. =Proof of the theorem= Let S denote the family of inverse mappings U×G→F. Consider the special case that F and G are spaces of exponentially decreasing sequences in Banach spaces, i.e. F=Σ(B) and G=Σ(C). (It is not too difficult to see that this is sufficient to prove the general case.) For a positive number c, consider the ordinary differential equation in Σ(B) given by :f'=c S\\\\Big(\\\\theta_t(f),\\\\theta_t\\\\big(g_\\\\infty-P(f)\\\\big)\\\\Big). Hamilton shows that if P(0)=0 and g∞ is sufficiently small in Σ(C), then the solution of this differential equation with initial condition f(0)=0 exists as a mapping [0,∞)→Σ(B), and that f(t) converges as t→∞ to a solution of P(f)=g∞.

They commemorate persons notable in the history of the district or the State. At the , Riverton had a population of 810. Including the rural areas surrounding the town, the population was 1213.  First storekeeper  The first storekeeper in the town, John Jubb Horner, arrived in South Australia in 1853 and soon made his way with his family to Riverton. His store, built in the early 1850s, was situated at the south end of the town. His store was the commercial emporium of Riverton, where the settlers would gather for social purposes as well as business. This store was also the original Post Office, Telegraph Office, and registry for births, deaths and marriages. The only other shop in the town in the early 1850s was owned by a cobbler, Mister Payne. The Riverton Hotel, originally known as the Riverton Arms, opened for business in 1855, although the building was not completed until 1857. This hotel, and the abovemention two shops, were the only business places in 1857. Local Government was proclaimed in July 1866, the first Court House and Police Station were opened that same year, the new Post Office and the Community Hall were both built in 1874.  Minerals  In 1897, it was reported that miners were engaged in opening up a mineral show in the hills about 5 miles (8 km) east of Riverton, resulting in what appeared to be a permanent lode of copper and silver lead. Samples were sent for assaying and the results were promising, silver and lead definitely being present. However no developments took place, which indicates that the lode could not have been as extensive as appeared at first. Even by 1965, fossickers still gleaned a little from this mineral deposit.  Railway  The transport problems for the Kapunda miners were eased in 1860 when the railway reached there. The question was whether the line should continue from Kapunda northwards along the valley of the River Light to Burra, or whether another line should stretch northwards from Gawler through the Gilbert Valley. The authorities decided on the latter route because it would open up thousands of acres of good agricultural land, encouraging the establishment of new towns along the route. That was a fortunate decision for Riverton. The Peterborough railway line was opened to Tarlee in 1868, Riverton on 20 December 1869 and Manoora in 1870. Railway workshops were immediately set up in Riverton. This swelled the population and sharply increased trade generally in the town. However, the workshops closed in 1878. Riverton Railway Station In 1918, the branch line to Clare was opened, which later extended to Spalding. This branch made it necessary for more railway employees to live at Riverton. In 1965, there were 25 railway employees and their families living there. Riverton station was the scene of an attempted mass shooting in 1921. A passenger who was travelling on the Broken Hill Express from Adelaide fired a number of shots into the dining room, and Percy Brookfield, the Member of Parliament for Broken Hill, was shot and killed when he tried to disarm the gunman. The massive buildings were the finest outside Adelaide, with the refreshment rooms being open for all passenger trains. At one time, passenger trains passing through Riverton had connections at Terowie to Broken Hill, Alice Springs and Perth. The refreshment rooms served a three-course dinner to east–west passengers and breakfast to Broken Hill passengers. The station building now houses tea-rooms, a gallery and bed and breakfast accommodation. Renovated, ensuite railway carriages provide unusual accommodation. The railways played a major part in the development of Riverton, both as a transport provider and as an employer. Today, the route of railway line from Riverton to Auburn has been converted into a walking/cycle rail trail, known as the Rattler Trail. The Rattler Trail joins the Riesling Trail at Auburn, providing a 43 km route from Riverton, through the heart of the Clare Valley wine region to the North. The Peterbrough railway line is also closed, although no rail trail has been created. Media Riverton was home to the Mid-North Courier, a newspaper printed between 5 January 1928 and 24 June 1942. It was available in Riverton, Saddleworth, Tarlee, Manoora, Marrabel and Rhynie. It was also home to a newspaper called the Gilbert Valley News (1 July 1965 - 27 July 1967). The distribution of the publication included: Riverton, Saddleworth, Manoora, Tarlee, Marrabel, Rhynie, Waterloo, Stockport and Black Springs. In August 1967, the newspaper merged with Hamley Bridge's Junction News and Owen Post (10 May 1946 – 28 July 1967) to form the Junction and Gilbert Valley News (4 August 1967 - 30 January 1969). This combined newspaper was then merged into The Bunyip, located in Gawler.  Governance  Riverton is in the District Council of Clare and Gilbert Valleys local government area, the state electoral district of Frome and the federal Division of Grey. Liberal politicians Clive Hannaford and Trish Worth were born in Riverton.

Miss Foyle (as she liked to be called) was born in London, England. At age 17, after leaving a Swiss finishing school, she started working at her father's bookshop, and never left. The store, Foyles, on Charing Cross Road in the West End of London, had been started in 1904 by her father, William Foyle. She fiercely resisted unionisation of bookshop staff, sacking most employees just before they had worked there six months, when they would gain limited job protection rights. In the late 1930s, she founded the Right Book Club to counter what she regarded as the pernicious influence of Victor Gollancz's Left Book Club. It offered a variety of titles with Conservative and classical Liberal themes.Right Book Club - Book Series List, publishinghistory.com. Retrieved 10 November 2019. In 1945, control of the shop passed to her. It was under her that the shop stagnated, with little investment and poorly paid staff who could be fired on a whim.John Walsh, \\"Foyles, the bookshop that time forgot\\", The Independent, 23 January 2003. She refused to install any modern conveniences such as electronic tills or calculators, nor would orders be taken by phone. However, the shop excelled in other fields: expensive books ordered from as far off as Germany were sent with a bill without prepayment. The shop operated a payment system that required customers to queue three times: to collect an invoice for a book, to pay the invoice, then to collect the book, simply because sales staff were not allowed to handle cash.Michael Handelzalts, \\"Foyled and found again\\", Haaretz, 30 May 2003. Equally mystifying to customers was a shelving arrangement that categorised books by publisher, rather than by topic or author. A quote of this period is: \\"Imagine Kafka had gone into the book trade.\\" In the 1980s a rival bookshop placed an advertisement in a bus shelter opposite Foyles: \\"Foyled again? Try Dillons\\". For 70 years she presided over Foyles lunches. Her idea for bringing readers, writers and thinkers together came after she recommended The Forsyte Saga to an elderly customer who was looking for something to read on the train. The gentleman bought a copy. However he returned it to her a short time later with the words \\"For the young lady who liked my book – John Galsworthy.\\" Foyle met many leading literary and political figures during her life. Her collection of personal correspondence included a letter from Adolf Hitler, responding to her complaint about Nazi book-burning. Her literary friends included Kingsley Amis, Charles de Gaulle, D. H. Lawrence, Yehudi Menuhin, J. B. Priestley, George Bernard Shaw, Margaret Thatcher, Evelyn Waugh and H. G. Wells. Foyle was the niece of Charles Henry Foyle, inventor of the \\"folding carton\\" and founder of Boxfoldia. Screenwriter Anthony Horowitz has said that Miss Foyle was the namesake for the title character, Christopher Foyle, in the ITV series Foyle's War. The Foyle Foundation was founded in 2001 under the terms of Christina Foyle's will. It makes grants to other UK charities, mainly in the fields of the arts and learning (until 2009, also health).

From its establishment in 1865 to its final closure in 1982, the pottery went through five distinct periods of ownership, producing a wide range of stoneware ranging from salt glazed ink bottles, utilitarian items and tableware to high quality and original art pottery.  Calvert Period – 1865 to 1883  In 1865, James Calvert, a chemist and druggist from Belper, Derbyshire, established the Langley Mill pottery on the site of a former brick-works. The company was known at that time as James Calvert. Historically, this area was already one of the major producers of stoneware pottery due to its location over the Derbyshire – Nottinghamshire Coal Field and several other stoneware potteries were already operational at that time. The local Coal Measures, as well as providing a ready source of fuel, were often associated with deposits of reddish clay, which proved to be highly suitable for the production of stoneware. It is therefore likely that Calvert chose the site for the new pottery with this in mind, although the close proximity of the Midland Railway and the Erewash Canal also afforded the prospect of excellent transport links. In the 1870s, James Calvert entered into a short lived partnership with another Belper chemist and druggist, William Peter Adshead, to form Calvert & Adshead. Around 1880, after an unsuccessful attempt to sell the business, James Calvert went into partnership with his son, William Henry Calvert, the pottery then being called J. Calvert & Son. The initial products of the pottery were items such as salt glazed inkpots, ginger beer bottles, polish pots, pitchers, jugs and mugs etc. These items were produced both for Calvert's own chemist and druggist business as well as being supplied to other similar businesses.  Calvert & Lovatt Period – 1883 to 1895  In 1883, Albert Lovatt and his brother, John Lovatt entered into partnership with William Calvert and the pottery's name was changed to Calvert and Lovatt. Both Lovatt brothers were born in Belper, Derbyshire and had previously been employed as potters at the nearby and larger Denby Pottery, operated by Joseph Bourne & Son. The new partnership at Langley Mill resulted in the development and introduction of new ranges of art wares. These were designed and decorated by artists employed by the pottery such as Mary Helen Goodyer (c1856–1941), George Leighton Parkinson (1864–1938) and William Calvert's second daughter, Eleanor \\"Daisy\\" Calvert (1874–1925). In 1895 William Calvert left the pottery, dissolving his partnership with the Lovatt brothers and effectively ending the production of art ware pottery at Langley Mill. The detailed reasons for his departure are not known, but the general difficulties experienced by the pottery industry during the 1890s and the possible disappointing profitability of the Langley art ware due to its relatively high production costs, may have been significant factors. After Calvert's departure, the company was renamed Lovatt & Lovatt. = Wares from the Calvert & Lovatt Period = The output during this period was perhaps the most accomplished to come out of the pottery at any period and included a great variety of vases, bowls, jardinières, fern pots, pot pourri and other similar decorative items - as well as the usual domestic and utilitarian items. Typical decoration of art ware pieces at this time by Helen Goodyer consisted of intricate incised designs, usually with a botanical theme, executed through one or more layers of previously applied coloured slip. George Leighton Parkinson designs also utilised incised patterns, often in conjunction with painted scenes. Typically the subjects of these miniature painted scenes were English pastoral scenes or various famous landmarks, such as the ruins of Tintern Abbey. Often, gilding was also applied to the incised designs. Art Wares produced at this time were usually marked on the base with an impressed \\"Langley Ware\\" mark, in a variety of designs. Occasionally, the artist concerned would also monogram some of the higher quality pieces. However, many pieces which were produced at Langley Mill seem to have no marks at all.  Lovatt & Lovatt Period - 1895 to 1930  New Art Ware Jardinière. c1903 (200 mm tall) Brown metallic finish Vase. 1924 (195 mm tall) Osborne Ware Jug with Pewter tilting cover. c1915 (190 mm tall) Turquoise and Cream Blossom Decoration Vases with combed glaze finish. 1915 & 1923(150 mm tall) Princess Ware Teaset. The period from the turn of the 19th century to the end of World War I (1914–1918) was a period of unparalleled prosperity, innovation and expansion for the Langley Mill Pottery, with the proprietors becoming increasingly affluent and influential. In 1913, following Albert Lovatt's death, the pottery was converted into a private limited company, Lovatt & Lovatt Ltd. with John Lovatt and Bert Lovatt (Albert's second son) as joint Chairman and Managing Director. Reginald, (Albert's third son) also joined the management of the company around this time. Unfortunately, after 1918, the post-war depression began to seriously affect the profitability of the pottery, a situation not helped by a period of apparently weak management. By 1923, the profitability of the pottery had declined significantly further, with the Directors being forced to take large cuts in their salaries. Finally, following the death of John Lovatt the previous year, the company went into voluntary liquidation on 18 July 1930. This ended the involvement of the Lovatt family in the affairs of the Langley Mill Pottery, although the Lovatt name did continue to be used by successive owners of the business. = Wares from the Lovatt & Lovatt Period = Despite the departure of Calvert, the cessation in the production of art ware proved to be only temporary and by the end of 1896, George Leighton Parkinson rejoined the company to head the Art Department. Art ware was always produced alongside the output of more mundane items and never constituted a major proportion of the pottery's output. In 1897, the production of decorated stoneware vases, pots and other items began again, although the output was not as fine as during the Calvert & Lovatt period as the emphasis was now on ease of production. Several ingenious methods to reduce production costs which did not result in a fall in quality were introduced, particularly in the area of decoration, resulting in the granting of Patent No. 8687 to the pottery in 1908. By 1905, lead had also been eliminated from the glazes used. Examples of wares from this period are Mycovera Ware, Applique Ware and Lovique Ware. By 1903, the New Art Ware was in production, consisting of hand-painted impasto flowers on a matt glaze background. The years between 1903 and 1909 also saw the introduction of additional domestic wares including Daisy Ware, Princess Ware, Green Fireproof Ware, Myrtle Ware, Royal Blue Ware and Osborne Ware.  Oakes Period – 1931 to 1959  In 1931, the Pottery was acquired as a subsidiary of James Oakes & Co. (Riddings) Ltd. and renamed Lovatts Potteries Ltd. One of the first actions of the new ownership was to introduce a substantial programme of modernisation, including the installation of a gas-fired Dressler Kiln to replace the old Round Kilns. The Dressler kiln allowed the continuous production of ware, and was much more efficient in both fuel and labour than the traditional round kilns. New ranges of distinctive domestic wares were quickly introduced including Marlborough, Sapphire, Rosslyn, Mavis and Hotspot. Production of the old Lovatt & Lovatt decorative and art wares mostly ceased and gilding was no longer used. At this time, the use of local clays was phased out and substituted by clays from Devon and Cornwall. = Wares from the Oakes Period = Production of the pottery at this time was principally domestic wares, but also included a considerable assortment of animal figures and also many utility items such as foot-warmers. It is at this time that the Langley \\"Windmill\\" trademark first appears. During World War II, (1939–1945), all art ware production ceased and the pottery output was switched to the manufacture of items for various UK Government Departments and products such as the very utilitarian General Household Brown Ware. During the 1950s the pottery brought out a series of more colourful ranges, in particular, Barbecue Ware, Casino, Roulette and Lime Grove. Despite being critically acclaimed by the Council of Industrial Design, these wares unfortunately did not prove to be popular with the public and by 1958 the pottery was once again unprofitable. James Oakes & Co. therefore had no alternative but to put the pottery up for sale. Bulb Bowl. 1931-39 (180 mm across) Windsor Green Jug. 1950-59 (200 mm tall)  Denby Period – 1959 to 1982  During this time, another major stoneware pottery at neighbouring Denby, Derbyshire (Joseph Bourne & Son) was experiencing difficulties in meeting orders on time due to some technical problems, a lack of production facilities and skilled labour. Joseph Bourne & Son therefore bought the Langley Mill pottery in October 1959, for a reported £25,000. This merger was also seen as a means of preventing the Langley Mill pottery from falling into the hands of Denby's competitors. The purchase of the Langley Mill pottery by Denby resulted in a merger of two of the larger producers of domestic stoneware in England. Initially, the two potteries were operated as two separate entities, with their own sales policies and distribution systems remaining unchanged. However, in terms of product lines, the new owners wished to impose a new direction on the Langley Mill pottery, placing a greater emphasis on the production of high quality kitchen ware and giftware. This period therefore saw a considerable number of new stoneware product ranges, some of which were targeted specifically at the American market. In 1967 the name of the pottery was changed yet again to Langley Pottery Ltd. Principal designers during this period were the father and son team of Albert and Glyn Colledge and also Gill Pemberton and Thelma Hague. In 1976 the decision was made to unite the two potteries under a single name, so the Langley Pottery Ltd. and Joseph Bourne & Son collectively became Denby Tableware Ltd. By the end of the 1970s, the two potteries were beginning to report annual losses, with the result that they were both sold to the Crown House group of companies. One of the first decisions of the new owners was that the Langley Mill site should be closed and production transferred to Denby. The final design to be produced at Langley Mill was \\"Falling Leaves\\", an oven-to-table ware designed by Thelma Hague. Soraya Pot. 1968-77 (135 mm tall)  Closure  Langley Mill pottery was closed in December 1982 with a special commemorative plate being produced to mark the last firing of the kiln and the sad end of 117 years of stoneware production. The site was eventually sold and the remaining buildings demolished in 1987. In 1997, the site was redeveloped and is now a small retail park. In 1987, the ownership of the remaining Denby pottery changed again, being purchased by the Coloroll Group, but in 1990, as a result of a management buy-out, it once again became an independent pottery, trading as Denby Pottery Company Limited and in 1994 was floated on the London Stock Exchange. It is still producing high quality stoneware today.

Population: History Kineshma was first noticed as a posad in 1429. In 1504, Ivan III gave it to Prince Feodor Belsky, who escaped to Moscow from Lithuania and married Ivan's niece. Later on, Ivan the Terrible gave Kineshma to Ivan Petrovich Shuisky, but after the latter's death it was returned to the Tsar in 1587. In the 16th and 17th centuries, Kineshma was a major fishing center, which supplied sturgeon for the Tsar's table. In 1608, it was twice ravaged by the Poles. Throughout its history, Kineshma belonged to different Russian regions, including Archangelgorod Governorate, Yaroslavl Province of Saint Petersburg Governorate, and Moscow Governorate. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Kineshma serves as the administrative center of Kineshemsky District,Law #145-OZ even though it is not a part of it.Law #145-OZ stipulates that the borders of the administrative districts are identical to the borders of the municipal districts. The Law #42-OZ, which describes the borders and the composition of Kineshemsky District, does not list the town of Kineshma as a part of that district. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the Town of Kineshma—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the Town of Kineshma is incorporated as Kineshma Urban Okrug.Law #124-OZ Economy Since the 18th century, the town's main industry has been textile manufacturing. Like all the textile centers in Russia, the town's prosperity declined after the perestroika. Architecture Kineshma's principal landmark is the Trinity Cathedral, built in 1838–1845 to a typical Neoclassical design. There are also several 18th-century churches in the town. The neighborhoods of Kineshma contain estates and museums of Alexander Ostrovsky, Alexander Borodin, and Fyodor Bredikhin. In 2010, Kineshma was granted status of a town of historical significance.

He was jailed by the Derg and later by the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF). After his death, The Guardian described him as \\"successively Ethiopia's most distinguished surgeon, physician and university dean, most controversial political party leader and best known political prisoner\\".  Medical work  Asrat studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh, becoming the first Ethiopian to qualify as a surgeon in the West. He then returned to Ethiopia, serving as Emperor Haile Selassie's personal physician until his 1975 death. He continued teaching and practicing medicine throughout the rule of President Mengistu Haile-Mariam.  Political activism and imprisonment  When Meles Zenawi succeeded Mengistu in 1991, Asrat became an active critic of the government, particularly of Meles' formation of new autonomous regions in Ethiopia. He then formed his own political party, the AAPO, with a central tenet of restoring Ethiopian unity. In 1994, he was sentenced to two years in prison for \\"planning violence against the state\\". International human rights organizations protested the evidence against him as unsound, and Amnesty International named him a prisoner of conscience. He was later convicted of more charges, extending his sentence by an additional three years. In 1996, Asrat faced a new trial which was repeatedly adjourned, keeping him in prison indefinitely.  Illness and death  In 1998, Asrat, who had previously had bypass surgery, developed further heart problems, and government doctors stated that he needed treatment overseas to survive. However, the Ethiopian government initially denied him permission to travel, triggering international appeals on his behalf. On December 25, 1998, authorities yielded to international pressure, granting him a compassionate release and allowing him treatment in Houston. Though his treatment was at first successful, Asrat died five months later of his heart ailment at the University of Pennsylvania hospital in Philadelphia.

Most of the on-reserve population lives near The Pas on the OCN 21E Reserve, but the band also has many other reserves stretching from Goose Lake, Manitoba in the north to Mountain Cabin, Saskatchewan in the south. The First Nation hosts the Opaskwayak Indian Days annually each August. The OCN Blizzard, a Manitoba Junior Hockey League team, is based on the Indian reserve and plays out of the Gordon Lathlin Memorial Centre. OCN is accessible by rail, road, water, and air travel.  History  The current townsite of Opaskwayak, reserve parcel 21E, was a historical gathering place where people travelled for spiritual healing. The area Cree would meet here every summer to fish, harvest, and cultivate the land. Also during this time it was an opportunity for creating social ties and practising the ceremonial way of life known as the or Grand Medicine Society. The language of the Opaskwayak people is from the Swampy Cree n-dialect. There was a number of local bands who shared the same defined territory which in turn, composed of a number of interrelated families who came together periodically through the year for various social, cultural activities and ceremonies. When the Opaskwayak people signed Treaty 5 on in 1876, the federal government agreed to give the band Timber Rights. In 1904, the band opened a sawmill on Mission Island in the Saskatchewan River. Soon after, the band surrendered their land on the south side of the river, and in 1908, they moved their sawmill to the north side. The sawmill operated intermittently until 1930, and provided wood for most of the homes built in the first few decades of the 20th century. The nation has made many developments, including the Joe. A. Ross, Oscar Lathlin Collegiate, and a Community Plex for the events such as bingos, socials and community events, etc. The local hotel, known as Kikiwak Inn, was built and completed in July 1996. The Otineka Shopping Mall was built in the early 1970s and opened in the 1975 which has various retail outlets. The McGillivary Care Home was constructed in 1982 for community elders. The community of Opaskwayak Cree Nation has two churches on the reserve. The Church of Redeemer is situated in Big Eddy, and the Church of Messiah is situated in the townsite area. Both of these churches have been recently constructed to replace the old churches. According to oral traditions Cree people have occupied the landscape of north- central Manitoba since a time before memory; archaeology supports this. The earliest archeological evidence of the people occupying the area has been carbon dated 2,600–4,000 years ago. Government The Band is governed by the Chief and eight Councilors, who are elected according to its own election code which was adopted by its members in 2012, for a three-year term. The reserve consists of 24 parcels of land varying in size from 10 to 5200 acres and totaling about 45,000 acres. The most populated settlements are located in and around the Town of The Pas. Most of the reserve's borders are with the Rural Municipality of Kelsey and the Town of The Pas. The balance is with the unorganized portion of Census Division No. 21.

Bacillary dysentery is associated with species of bacteria from the family Enterobacteriaceae. The term is usually restricted to Shigella infections. Shigellosis is caused by one of several types of Shigella bacteria. Three species are associated with bacillary dysentery: Shigella sonnei, Shigella flexneri and Shigella dysenteriae. A study in China indicated that Shigella flexneri 2a was the most common serotype. Salmonellosis caused by Salmonella enterica (serovar Typhimurium) has also been described as a cause of bacillary dysentery, though this definition is less common. It is sometimes listed as an explicit differential diagnosis of bacillary dysentery, as opposed to a cause. Bacillary dysentery should not be confused with diarrhea caused by other bacterial infections. One characteristic of bacillary dysentery is blood in stool, which is the result of invasion of the mucosa by the pathogen. Pathogenesis Transmission is fecal-oral and is remarkable for the small number of organisms that may cause disease (10 ingested organisms cause illness in 10% of volunteers, and 500 organisms cause disease in 50% of volunteers). Shigella bacteria invade the intestinal mucosal cells but do not usually go beyond the lamina propria. Dysentery is caused when the bacteria escape the epithelial cell phagolysosome, multiply within the cytoplasm, and destroy host cells. Shiga toxin causes hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic-uremic syndrome by damaging endothelial cells in the microvasculature of the colon and the glomeruli, respectively. In addition, chronic arthritis secondary to S. flexneri infection, called reactive arthritis, may be caused by a bacterial antigen; the occurrence of this syndrome is strongly linked to HLA-B27 genotype, but the immunologic basis of this reaction is not understood. Diagnosis Specimen: Fresh stool is collected. Culture: Specimen is inoculated on selective media like MacConkey's agar, DCA, XLD agar. Selenite F broth(0.4%) is used as enrichment medium which permits the rapid growth of enteric pathogens while inhibiting the growth of normal flora like E. coli for 6–8 hours. Subculture is done on the solid media from selenite F broth. All the solid media are incubated at 37 degrees for 24 hours. Cultural characteristics: Colorless (NLF) colonies appear on MacConkey's agar which are further confirmed by gram staining, hanging drop preparation and biochemical reactions. Treatment Dysentery is initially managed by maintaining fluid intake using oral rehydration therapy. If this treatment cannot be adequately maintained due to vomiting or the profuseness of diarrhea, hospital admission may be required for intravenous fluid replacement. Ideally, no antimicrobial therapy should be administered until microbiological microscopy and culture studies have established the specific infection involved. When laboratory services are not available, it may be necessary to administer a combination of drugs, including an amoebicidal drug to kill the parasite and an antibiotic to treat any associated bacterial infection. Anyone with bloody diarrhea needs immediate medical help. Treatment often starts with an oral rehydrating solution—water mixed with salt and carbohydrates—to prevent dehydration. (Emergency relief services often distribute inexpensive packets of sugars and mineral salts that can be mixed with clean water and used to restore lifesaving fluids in dehydrated children gravely ill from dysentery.) If Shigella is suspected and it is not too severe, the doctor may recommend letting it run its course—usually less than a week. The patient will be advised to replace fluids lost through diarrhea. If the infection is severe, the doctor may prescribe antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin or TMP-SMX (Bactrim). Unfortunately, many strains of Shigella are becoming resistant to common antibiotics, and effective medications are often in short supply in developing countries. If necessary, a doctor may have to reserve antibiotics for those at highest risk for death, including young children, people over 50, and anyone suffering from dehydration or malnutrition. No vaccine is available. There are several Shigella vaccine candidates in various stages of development that could reduce the incidence of dysentery in endemic countries, as well as in travelers suffering from traveler's diarrhea.

Two other forms are known: beta-Lithium nitride, formed from the alpha phase at has the sodium arsenide (Na3As) structure; gamma-Lithium nitride (same structure as Li3Bi) forms from the beta form at . Lithium nitride shows ionic conductivity for Li+, with a value of c. 2×10−4Ω−1cm−1, and an (intracrystal) activation energy of c. 0.26eV (c. 24 kJ/mol). Hydrogen doping increases conductivity, whilst doping with metal ions (Al, Cu, Mg) reduces it. The activation energy for lithium transfer across lithium nitride crystals (intercrystalline) has been determined to be higher at c. 68.5 kJ/mol. The alpha form is a semiconductor with band gap of c. 2.1 eV. Reaction with hydrogen at under 300 °C (0.5 MPa pressure) produces lithium hydride and lithium amide. Lithium nitride has been investigated as a storage medium for hydrogen gas, as the reaction is reversible at 270 °C. Up to 11.5% by weight absorption of hydrogen has been achieved. Reacting lithium nitride with carbon dioxide results in amorphous carbon nitride (C3N4), a semiconductor, and lithium cyanamide (Li2CN2), a precursor to fertilizers, in an exothermic reaction.

Isovists are naturally three-dimensional, but they may also be studied in two dimensions: either in horizontal section (\\"plan\\") or in other vertical sections through the three-dimensional isovist. Every point in physical space has an isovist associated with it. The boundary-shape of an isovist may or may not vary with location in, say, a room. If the room is convex (for example, a rectangle or circle), then the boundary-shape of every isovist in that room is the same; and so is its volume (or area, if we are thinking in plan). But the location of the viewpoint relative to the boundary would or could be different. However, if the room were non-convex (for example, an L-shaped or partitioned room), then there would be many isovists whose volume (area) would be less than that of the whole room, and perhaps some that were the whole room; and many would have different, perhaps unique shapes: large and small, narrow and wide, centric and eccentric, whole and shredded. One can also think of the isovist as the volume of space illuminated by a point source of light. It is used in the field of architecture for analysis of buildings and urban areas, typically as one of a series of methods used in space syntax.

He is best known for his contributions to atomic and molecular physics and solid-state physics. His key achievements include calculating relativistic effects on the spin-orbit interaction in a hydrogen atom (Thomas precession), creating an approximate theory of N-body quantum systems (Thomas-Fermi theory), and devising an efficient method for solving tridiagonal system of linear equations (Thomas algorithm).  Life and education  Born in London, he studied at Cambridge University, receiving his BA, PhD, and MA degrees in 1924, 1927 and 1928 respectively. While on a Traveling Fellowship for the academic year 1925–1926 at Bohr's Institute in Copenhagen, he proposed Thomas precession in 1926, to explain the difference between predictions made by spin-orbit coupling theory and experimental observations. In 1929 he obtained a job as a professor of physics at the Ohio State University, where he stayed until 1943. He married Naomi Estelle Frech in 1933. In 1935 he was the master's thesis advisor for Leonard Schiff, whose thesis was published with Thomas as coauthor. From 1943 until 1945 Thomas worked on ballistics at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland. In 1946 he became a member of the staff of the Watson Scientific Computing Laboratory at Columbia University, remaining there until 1968. In 1958 he was elected as a member of the National Academy of Sciences. In 1963, Thomas was appointed as IBM's First Fellow in the Watson Research Center. He was appointed professor at North Carolina State University in 1968, retiring from this position in 1976. In 1982 he received the Davisson-Germer Prize. He died in Raleigh, North Carolina.  Contributions  Thomas was responsible for multiple advances in physics. The Thomas precession is a correction to the atomic spin-orbit interaction in quantum mechanics, which takes into account the relativistic time dilation between the electron and the atomic nucleus. The Thomas–Fermi model is a statistical model for electron-ion interactions, which later formed the basis of density functional theory. The Thomas collapse is effect in few- body physics, which corresponds to infinite value of the three body binding energy for zero-range potentials. In mathematics, his name is frequently attached to an efficient Gaussian elimination method for tridiagonal matrices—the Thomas algorithm.  Notable publications  * Thomas L. H.

Reis was born in Rio de Janeiro, the eleventh of thirteen children. He attended secondary school at Colégio D. Pedro II, and, on leaving school in 1924, was awarded the \\"Pantheon\\" prize, conferred on the best students of Colégio D. Pedro II. He went on to study medicine at the University of Brazil's National Faculty of Medicine (presently Federal University of Rio de Janeiro) from 1925. During his medical course, he studied pathology at the Instituto Oswaldo Cruz. After graduation, he worked from 1928 to 1929 at the Institute as a bacteriologist, having decided to specialize in scientific research in virology. For his achievements there, he received the Oswaldo Cruz Medal. As a result, he accepted an invitation to move to São Paulo in the next year and work at the Instituto Biológico (Biological Institute), an applied research center set up by the state government, in the section of bacteriology. Later, he studied at the Rockefeller Institute in New York City, United States, from 1935 to 1936. Returning to Brazil, Dr. Reis resumed his work at the Biological Institute. Under the instigation of the Institute's director, the German biologist Hermann von Ihering, to study a mysterious viral disease afflicting chicken producers in the state, he became gradually a renowned world expert on ornithopathology (avian diseases) and eventually was nominated director of the Institute. He felt also the urge to write pamphlets and booklets in a simple language, in order to instruct the agriculturists of the state on how to prevent and fight this and other diseases, and soon started to contribute regularly to a specialized magazine in this field, \\"Chácaras & Quintais\\". In 1947, Dr. José Reis, who now displayed a marvelous talent for explaining scientific concepts for laypeople, started a parallel career as a journalist, first by writing a science column at one of the town's two most important newspapers, the Folha de S.Paulo. He maintained this column for the next 55 years, until shortly before his death, probably a world record for a science newspaper columnist. The column was syndicated to many other newspapers. He also dabbed in general journalism, and became one of the editors-in-chief at the Folha from 1962 to 1968, during the critical years of the military régime which was installed in April 1964 in Brazil. As a scientific leader, Reis was exceedingly important for the history of Brazilian science and technology, as one of the founders of the Brazilian Society for the Advancement of Science (SBPC), in 1949, together with other important scientific personalities of the country, such as Jorge Americano, Paulo Sawaya, Maurício Rocha e Silva, Gastão Rosenfeld, Wilson Teixeira Beraldo, José Ribeiro do Vale and others . He was also the founder and the editor-in-chief for almost his entire life of \\"Ciência e Cultura\\", SBPC's official journal. Reis received many national and international prizes, awards and honours, such as the Jonh R. Reitermeyer Award, granted by the Inter-American Press Society and the Panamerican Press Union in 1964; and the prestigious Kalinga Prize for the Popularization of Science by UNESCO (United Nations Organization for Education, Science and Culture). In his honour, the Brazilian National Research Council (CNPq) instituted in 1978 the José Reis Science Communication Award. His name is honoured also in the Núcleo José Reis de Divulgação Científica, a research and education centre at the School of Communication and Arts of the University of São Paulo. Reis continued his work at Folha de S.Paulo until his death in São Paulo; he died of complications of multiple pneumonia in 2002, at 94 years of age.

After Yaohan filed for bankruptcy in the late 1990s, the centre became a lower-end mall specialising in various oriental foods and items. Oriental City was located on Edgware Road, near Colindale tube station. It had a dedicated car park, and two floors. The complex was closed for redevelopment on 1 June 2008 and, after several changes of ownership, was demolished in August 2014. Between December 2009 and April 2011, a complex similar to Oriental City traded in Wembley Retail Park, called Pacific Plaza. In July 2017 the Bang Bang Oriental Food Hall opened on the site, comprising 32 food kiosks, massage and beauty therapy suites as well as shops and a cultural centre.http://www.bangbangoriental.com/ Yaohan Plaza Yaohan Plaza was built as a Yaohan Shopping Centre, where it operated as a high-end Japanese shopping centre. After the Yaohan Corporation filed for bankruptcy in the late 1990s, it was sold to Malaysian owners, which was when it was renamed Oriental City. Many locals and visitors still continued to refer to it as Yaohan Plaza.  Oriental City  After the centre was bought by Malaysian owners, it contained a large oriental supermarket, now relocated to Bayswater, and a food court with a range of foods from different areas of South-East Asia; stalls offered Malaysian, Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese, Korean and Japanese foods including bento boxes and sushi, ramen noodles, and assorted Asian desserts. The food court was immensely popular with surrounding office workers and the North London community; and often became very crowded at weekends. The food court was complemented by a number of oriental restaurants in the complex, with the majority of them located on the upper floor. The complex contained two Dim Sum restaurants, a Szechuan restaurant, and an 'all you can eat' restaurant. Outside, there was a durian stall and a satay stall. Aside from the food outlets, the complex also contained a number of small shops and stalls. Over its history there was a high turnover of shops, with only one remaining original tenant in the facility, the Japanese tableware store, Utsuwa-No-Yataka. The centre also previously housed a shop selling video games and toys imported from Japan, a Sanrio boutique, and one of the largest Japanese bookshops in Europe, called Asahiya Shoten. These have been closed down since 2003. In the period shortly before the centre closed down, shoppers could find a tailor's shop, a jeweller, a hairdresser, a beauty shop, Chinese medicine shops, a martial arts store, and a large furniture store. Oriental City was also host to a Sega Dome (Later Sega Park) arcade which has been a feature since the complex's opening in 1993. The arcade's outer façade was highly noticeable for the large picture of Sonic the Hedgehog attached to it, which had been on the complex since the early 1990s. It also boasted one of the largest Oriental supermarkets in London; The only comparable supermarkets today would be Wing Yip and the Japan Centre in Regent Street. The centre was a focal point for the Oriental community, often hosting weeks which promoted the cultural identity of different South East Asian countries. These events typically consisted of various performing arts, and the promotion of that country's particular cuisine. The original Yaohan Plaza also featured a small example of a traditional Japanese garden outside the centre, which was allowed to fall into disrepair after the change of ownership. Proposed redevelopment Facade along Edgware Road Entrance In November 2006, Oriental City was bought out by the developer Development Securities who planned to demolish the centre and replace it with a B&Q;, a housing development and a primary school. This private business transaction was beset by delays from store owners, the East Asian community, petitions, and even interference by the Chinese Consul-General and an ex-Arsenal football player. The developer was not able to close the complex until 2008, by which time the Great Recession had soured their ability to proceed with the redevelopment. In 2006, the developers stated that there would be provisions for the current tenants of Oriental City to continue in the new development; however, the tenants objected to this, owing to the lack of consultation. Tenants stated that the new complex would take up to 9 years to complete, contrary to Development Securities' claim that redevelopment would take 3 years. Most tenants did not believe they could survive even a temporary relocation of their businesses.'Asian traders protest over plans to demolish \\"Oriental City\\"', The Independent, 17 November 2006 (accessed 19 November 2006) Aside from business considerations, the East Asian community feared any redevelopment would mean the loss of an important community focal point. The tenants shut their businesses for a day to protest to the council at Brent Town Hall on 21 November 2006 feeling that they had been treated like 'second class citizens'.'Campaign to save \\"'real Chinatown'\\"', BBC News, 17 November 2006 (accessed 19 November 2006) The tenants' plight was backed by a long-time visitor of the Centre, ex-Arsenal football player Ian Wright, who met the then London Mayor Ken Livingstone's planning officials in early December 2006 to object to the redevelopment plans.'Wright backs Oriental City fight', BBC News, 4 December 2006 (accessed 6 December 2006) In February 2007, the Chinese Consul-General wrote to London's mayor to express his \\"deep concern\\" about the project, calling for the proposal to be modified.'Beijing enters Oriental City row', BBC News, 8 February 2007 (accessed 8 February 2007) Following a petition, it was announced that Oriental City would remain open until at least May 2008. The centre closed permanently at 7:00 pm on Sunday 1 June 2008, with thousands of people flocking to see Oriental City for the last time on its final day. On 31 July 2008 Development Securities sold the site to a new developer, B & S Homes, for £68 million. The purchasers paid a £16 million deposit but were unable to find the £52 million required to complete their purchase. Their deposit was lost, the building went back into the hands of Development Securities, and further progress in the prevailing economic climate looked unlikely. As a result, the building remained boarded up and derelict.‘Oriental City deal collapses’, Property Week, 31 March 2009 (accessed 19 August 2009) From early 2009, there was much talk amongst former tenants of a proposal to reopen the doors of Oriental City in its previous form later that year. Discussions were understood to be taking place between the owners and former tenants. In February 2010, former tenants of Oriental City held a protest at the site over the continued closure of the centre. A campaign to re-open the centre was initiated, and it was reported that Morrisons was interested in developing the site.(Kilburn Times, 1 March 2012) In May 2013, planning permission was granted for a full redevelopment of the site by Development Securities with Morrisons as an anchor tenant. In August 2014 the Oriental City building was demolished, and a new development including flats and a Morrisons Superstore was built on the location, the store opening in March 2016. Brent Council reserved the remaining part of the retail site for \\"Far Eastern and Oriental uses\\" only, incorporating 30,000 sq ft of restaurant space. This was later allocated to the Bang Bang Oriental Food Hall. TV/Film Set The centre was used as an abandoned mall in the BBC One series Luther. It appeared in the 2012 film Dredd, where it was restored to a semblance of its former glory with a Blade Runner-like makeover. It was used in the first episode of the 2011 BBC Three series The Fades. Oriental City was the single location used for the 2012 TV film of a Royal Shakespeare Company production of Julius Caesar, directed by Gregory Doran.http://www.illuminationsmedia.co.uk/tis-time-to-part-days-11-12/ The complex appeared in 2013 during a first season episode of the BBC Two series Charlie Brooker's Weekly Wipe, with Brooker wandering around various parts of the derelict car park, Zen Tian Di Chinese buffet and a set of escalators. The centre was also used for the music video Bittersweet Memories by Welsh metalcore band Bullet For My Valentine. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cW_BuQqzGs See also * Japanese community of London * Pacific Plaza * Chinatown * Wing Yip * British Chinese ReferencesExternal links * Video of Oriental City Food Court taken 25.05.08 * Flickr group for photos and videos of Oriental City * Route79's Flickr pictures of Oriental City * 'Oriental City Agreement Reached', dimsum.co.uk * 'Oriental City protest', dimsum.co.uk * \\"Anger over continued closure of 'real Chinatown'\\" BBC article, February 2010 * \\"End of the road for 'real Chinatown'?\\", BBC article * London Randomness Guide to Oriental City * Early Look at Pacific Plaza, willeatformoney.blogspot.com] * Campaign & petition to re-open Oriental City * https://web.archive.org/web/20110216090458/http://www.yell.com/reviews/oriental+city+supermarket-1g16x8a-r Category:Shopping centres in the London Borough of Brent Category:Former buildings and structures in the London Borough of Brent Category:Demolished buildings and structures in London Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 2014 ","title":"Oriental City"},{"id":"2286338","text":"Maque choux (left) with dill mashed potatoes Maque choux is a traditional Cajun dish of Louisiana. It is thought to be an amalgam of Creole and American Indian cultural influence, and the name is likely to derive from the French interpretation of the Native American name. It contains corn, green bell pepper, onion, and sometimes garlic, celery, and tomato. The ingredients are braised in a pot. Historically bacon grease was used for the braising stage, although various combinations of oil, butter, or cream may be substituted. The vegetables are then left to simmer until they reach a tender consistency, with chicken stock or water added as necessary. The dish is finished with salt and a combination of red and black pepper. Some cooks include hot sauce and a bit of sugar for greater complexity. Maque choux is usually served as an accompaniment; however, it can also act as a base for a main meal and use local ingredients such as bite-sized portions of chicken or crawfish. Shrimp is often added in the later stages of cooking as well. References * DeMers, John. The Food of New Orleans. 1997 Perplus Editions (HK) Limited: Boston. p. 76 * The Junior League of New Orleans.

It stands at the southeast foot of an extinct volcano, Rocca Monfina. Its St. Clement's cathedral is the see of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Teano-Calvi, which started as the Diocese of Teano circa AD 300.  History = Ancient times and Middle Ages= The ancient Teanum Sidicinum was the capital of the Oscan tribe of the Sidicini, which drove the Aurunci from Roccamonfina. They probably submitted to Rome in 334 BC and their troops were grouped with those of Campania in the Roman army. Thus the garrison of Regium, which in 280 attacked the citizens, consisted of one cohort of Sidicini and two of Campanians. Like Cales, Teanum continued to have the right of coinage, and, like Suessa and Cales, remained faithful to Rome in both the Hannibalic and the Social wars. Its position gave it some military importance, and it was apparently made a colony by Claudius, not by Augustus. Strabo speaks of it as the most important town on the Via Latina, joined by a branch road from Suessa, of which remains still exist, and which continued east to Alife. In the 4th century Teano became seat of a diocese, and was later an important Lombard county, as part of the Duchy of Benevento. The Benedictines had several properties in the city, where the monks from Montecassino took refuge when their abbey was destroyed in 883. Here one of the first document of vulgare Italian was issued in 963. = \\"Handshake of Teano\\"= Teano was the site of the famous meeting of 26 October 1860, between Italian nationalist fighter Giuseppe Garibaldi and Victor Emanuel II, the King of Sardinia. Having wrested the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies from the Neapolitan Bourbons, Garibaldi shook Victor Emanuel's hand and hailed him as King of Italy. Thus, Garibaldi sacrificed republican hopes for the sake of Italian unity under a monarchy. The event is a popular subject for Italian patriotic statuesFor example, see entry for The Encounter of Teano, Fiesole. and paintings. The Handshake of Teano, by Carlo Ademollo  Main sights  * Roman remains of Teano include the theater (2nd century BC, rebuilt in the 2nd century AD), once one of the greatest in Italy with its 85 m of diameter, some extensive baths (Le Caldarelle) containing several statues, and some Roman dwellings. A tomb with a Christian mosaic representing the visit of the Three Wise Men to Bethlehem was found in 1907. Of the famous amphitheater, cited by several sources, no traces remain. * Cathedral of St Clement (also called San Giovanni Ante Portam Latinam), begun around 1050 and completed in 1116, using Corinthian columns obtained from the ruins of the ancient town. It has a basilica plant with a nave and two aisles. After a fire, the church was rebuilt in 1610. The portico preceding the facade houses two sphinxes in red granite, coming from a pre-existing pagan temple. In the interior are a pergamum, with interesting parts from the original of the 12th century and a 14th-century Crucifix of Giotto's school, while the crypt houses a noteworthy Roman sarcophagus. * Castle, built by the dukes of Sessa in the 15th century, originating from a 4th-century BC fortress. In the Bourbon era it was used as prison. Other sights include: * Loggione, built over Roman baths in Gothic style. * San Peter in Aquariis: 14th century church, built over a Palaeo- Christian edifice (in turn constructed over a Roman bath, whence the epithet in Aquariis, \\"on the water\\"). Recent restoration work has revealed precious Byzantine frescoes depicting St. Agatha, St Martha, and St Mark and John the Evangelist. The belfry is a rare example of Byzantine architecture in southern Italy. * St Benedict, the most ancient church within the walls, built in the 9th century over a temple dedicated to Ceres. It has 12 granite and marble columns with antique capitals, and once housed precious Benedictine documents which went lost after a fire. * San Paride ad Fontem: Paleo-Christian church located on the southeast site below the town. It was built over a Roman cisterna, whence the name (fons, fontis being Latin for a fountain or water source). Built originally in the 4th century, the current construction is from the 11th-12th centuries (extensively restored in 1988). * Franciscan convent of St Anthony of Padua was built in 1427, according to tradition, by the will of Bernardino da Siena, who also lived here for some years.  Transportation  Teano is from the gate of Capua of A1 Milan-Naples highway. It can be also reached by road through SS.7 Via Appia and SS.6 Via Casilina. The city is also served by a railway station.

Life He entered the civil service after the completion of his education at the École Polytechnique. He was a railway expert, becoming secretary-general of the Railway Commission established in 1842, government commissioner to the authorized railway companies, administrator of the Lyon-Mediterranean railway, and commissioner to examine foreign railways. In 1846 he was returned to the Chamber of Deputies for Hérault, but the revolution of 1848 drove him into private life, from which he only emerged after the downfall of the Second Empire, when in February 1871 he was returned to the National Assembly. He supported the government of Adolphe Thiers and was minister of agriculture and commerce in 1872–73. He sat in the Left Centre, and steadily supported republican principles. He entered the Senate in 1876, and was minister of agriculture in the Dufaure-Ricard cabinet of that year, retaining his portfolio in the Jules Simon ministry which fell on 16 May 1877. In 1878, when he joined the new Dufaure cabinet, he opened the Paris exhibition of agriculture and manufactures, the original suggestion of which had been made by him during his 1876 ministry. In 1879 he was sent as ambassador to Vienna, whence he was next year recalled on the score of health. Two years later he re-entered the Senate, where he did good service to the cause of \\"Republican Defence\\" during the Boulangist agitation.

Side effects of nandrolone decanoate may include symptoms of masculinization like acne, increased hair growth, voice changes, and increased sexual desire. The medication is a synthetic androgen and anabolic steroid and hence is an agonist of the androgen receptor (AR), the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). It has strong anabolic effects and weak androgenic effects, which give it a mild side effect profile and make it especially suitable for use in women and children. Nandrolone decanoate is a nandrolone ester and a long-lasting prodrug of nandrolone in the body. Nandrolone decanoate was first described in 1960 and was introduced for medical use in 1962. It was the second nandrolone ester to be introduced, following nandrolone phenylpropionate (NPP) in 1959, and is one of the most widely used nandrolone esters. It is also one of the most widely used AAS worldwide. In addition to its medical use, nandrolone decanoate is used to improve physique and performance, and is said to be the most widely used AAS for such purposes. The drug is a controlled substance in many countries and so non-medical use is generally illicit. Medical uses Nandrolone decanoate is approved in the United States specifically for the treatment of anemia of chronic kidney disease and in the United Kingdom specifically for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=3f059e04-1ebc-40bb-a49c-f9d90d41b1cbhttps://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/files/pil.5374.pdf?filename=PIL.5374.pdf In Australia, it is approved specifically for the treatment of kidney failure, chronic kidney disease, anemia of kidney failure, aplastic anemia, osteoporosis (in women in whom estrogens are contraindicated), inoperable breast cancer, and for patients on long-term corticosteroid therapy.https://web.archive.org/web/20190309024812/https://gp2u.com.au/static/pdf/D/DECA- DURABOLIN-PI.pdf In New Zealand, it is approved for osteoporosis, inoperable breast cancer, and as an adjunct to therapy for conditions characterized by a negative nitrogen balance. The drug is often used off-label to preserve lean mass in HIV/AIDS patients and in other wasting syndromes. In the past, nandrolone decanoate has also been indicated and used for a variety of other conditions and situations including pre- and postoperative use for increasing lean mass, treating weight loss due to convalescence or disease, geriatric states (e.g., general weakness, fatigue), burns, severe trauma, ulcers, and selected cases of growth failure in children. Starting in the 1970s, the indications of nandrolone decanoate were refined and use of the drug became more selective and restricted. Its use in medicine continues to decline and has become limited, with its sale having been discontinued in many countries. Nandrolone esters can be used as a form of androgen replacement therapy for treatment of androgen deficiency in men. However, they have not generally been used for this purpose, and have instead mostly been used only as anabolic agents. In any case, nandrolone decanoate has widely been used at low doses as a means of androgen replacement in postmenopausal women, for instance to maintain or increase bone mineral density and decrease the risk of osteoporosis. It is one of only three androgens approved for androgen replacement in postmenopausal women, the others being testosterone (and esters) and methyltestosterone. Nandrolone esters have more recently been proposed for more widespread treatment of androgen deficiency in men due to favorable properties including their high ratio of anabolic to androgenic effect and hence lower or negligible risk of scalp hair loss, prostate enlargement, and prostate cancer relative to testosterone. Nandrolone esters and related compounds such as trestolone and dimethandrolone undecanoate have also been studied as means of androgen replacement in investigational male contraceptive regimens. =Dosages= A dosage of nandrolone decanoate of 25 to 50 mg once every 6 to 12 weeks (working out to an average exposure of about 2 to 8 mg per week) by intramuscular injection is considered to be appropriate for general androgen replacement therapy in women. A dosage of 50 mg once every 2 to 4 weeks by intramuscular injection is used in the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and in the palliative treatment of inoperative breast cancer. For children aged 2 to 13 years, the average dosage for anemia of chronic kidney disease is 25 to 50 mg every 3 to 4 weeks by intramuscular injection. Dosages in men and for other uses have also been described. =Available forms= Nandrolone decanoate has been available in 25 mg/mL, 50 mg/mL, 100 mg/mL, and 200 mg/mL formulations in oil solution for intramuscular injection. Non-medical uses Nandrolone decanoate is used for physique- and performance-enhancing purposes by competitive athletes, bodybuilders, and powerlifters. It is consumed by bodybuilders as per 8-12 weeks bulking cycles with some form of Testosterone as a base because, according to the studies: if consumed solo (i.e., without a base); it shuts down the natural production of Testosterone by altering blood–testis barrier components. Despite this fact, Nandrolone decanoate is one of the most popular injectable AAS worldwide, and nandrolone esters have been said to be the most popular AAS used by bodybuilders and in sports. This is in part due to the high ratio of anabolic to androgenic effect of nandrolone and its weak propensity for androgenic and estrogenic side effects. Contraindications Contraindications for nandrolone decanoate include pregnancy, breastfeeding, prostate cancer, male breast cancer, breast cancer in women with hypercalcemia, hypersensitivity (to nandrolone decanoate or excipients such as arachis (peanut) oil; includes those with peanut and soy allergies), nephrosis or nephritis, liver disease with impaired bilirubin excretion, and heart failure. High dosages may also be considered contraindicated in women due to their high potential for virilization. Side effects The side effects of nandrolone decanoate are dependent on dosage, duration of treatment, and individual sensitivity. A number of common, uncommon, and rare side effects have been observed with the medication at recommended dosages. While less common or severe than with many other AAS, the most common side effect of nandrolone decanoate is virilization (masculinization) in women. Uncommon side effects of nandrolone decanoate at recommended dosages include fluid retention, inhibition of spermatogenesis, testicular atrophy, erectile dysfunction, gynecomastia, increased frequency of penile erections, increased penis size in pre-pubertal boys, clitoral hypertrophy, increased pubic hair growth, oligomenorrhea, amenorrhea, hyperlipidemia, decreased HDL cholesterol, increased hemoglobin (to abnormal high levels), hypertension, nausea, epididymitis, bladder irritability, reduced urine flow, benign prostatic hyperplasia, priapism, premature epiphyseal closure (in children), and acne. Rare side effects include abnormal liver function, jaundice, peliosis hepatis, liver tumors, oily skin, greasy hair, rash, pruritus, exanthema, urticaria at the injection site, and furunculosis. Local injection site reactions may also occur. Unlike 17α-alkylated AAS such as methyltestosterone, nandrolone decanoate is not associated with liver toxicity. =Virilization= Nandrolone decanoate causes virilization as a common side effect in women, including acne, hoarseness of the voice, hirsutism (excessive facial/body hair growth), and libido changes, among others. Clitoral enlargement is an uncommon symptom of virilization that can occur. Virilization is especially prevalent and marked at high dosages of nandrolone decanoate and/or with long-term treatment, and some aspects of virilization like voice deepening can be irreversible. Hoarseness is often the first sign of voice changes. Although said to be only slightly androgenic, nandrolone decanoate may still occasionally cause virilization at recommended dosages in women, especially with long-term treatment. A minor though statistically insignificant incidence of virilization has been observed in women treated with nandrolone decanoate short-term at a dosage of 100 mg every 2 weeks for 12 weeks. Conversely, long- term (>1 year) studies have shown significant virilization in women even at a dosage of 50 mg every 2 or 3 weeks. Overdose The acute toxicity of nandrolone esters in animals and donkeys is very low and there are no reports of acute overdosage with nandrolone decanoate in humans. There are no specific recommendations for the management of nandrolone decanoate. Interactions Antiestrogens like aromatase inhibitors (e.g., anastrozole) and selective estrogen receptor modulators (e.g., tamoxifen, raloxifene) can interfere with and prevent the estrogenic effects of nandrolone decanoate. 5α-Reductase inhibitors like finasteride and dutasteride can prevent the inactivation of nandrolone in so-called \\"androgenic\\" tissues like the skin, hair follicles, and prostate gland, and may therefore considerably increase its androgenic side effects. This is opposite to the case of most other AAS, which are either potentiated by 5α-reductase in such tissues or are not substrates of 5α-reductase. Antiandrogens like cyproterone acetate, spironolactone, and bicalutamide can block both the anabolic and androgenic effects of AAS like nandrolone decanoate. Pharmacology=Pharmacodynamics= Nandrolone, the active form of nandrolone decanoate. Nandrolone decanoate is a nandrolone ester, or a prodrug of nandrolone. As such, it is an androgen and anabolic steroid, or an agonist of the AR, the biological target of androgens like testosterone and DHT. Relative to testosterone, nandrolone decanoate has enhanced anabolic effects and reduced androgenic effects. It is considered to have strong anabolic effects but weak androgenic effects, with respective potency ratios of 3.29–4.92 and 0.31–0.41 (index value 10.6–12.1 or about an 11:1 ratio of myotrophic to androgenic effect) relative to testosterone propionate. This is defined specifically on the basis of a rodent model in which change in the weights of the rat bulbocavernosus/levator ani muscle (\\"anabolic\\" or \\"myotrophic\\" activity) and the rat ventral prostate or seminal vesicles (\\"androgenic\\" activity) are compared with testosterone and then used to form a ratio. Along with oxandrolone (which has a ratio of about 10:1), nandrolone esters are thought to have the highest ratio of anabolic to androgenic effect of any other AAS. For this reason, they are considered to be among the most appropriate AAS for use in women and children. Androgenic effects like virilization are relatively uncommon with nandrolone decanoate at recommended dosages, though may still occur especially at higher dosages or with extended use. The low androgenicity of nandrolone decanoate is thought to be due to the fact that whereas many other AAS like testosterone are potentiated via transformation by 5α-reductase into more potent AR agonists like DHT in specific tissues including the skin, hair follicles, prostate gland, liver, and brain, nandrolone is instead inactivated by 5α-reductase via transformation into the low-affinity AR ligand 5α-dihydronandrolone in such tissues. This is thought to result in a much lower incidence and magnitude of facial/body hair growth, scalp hair loss, and possibly prostate issues like prostate enlargement and prostate cancer with nandrolone esters relative to testosterone. In addition to its anabolic and androgenic activity, nandrolone decanoate has low estrogenic activity (via its metabolite estradiol) and moderate progestogenic activity. This may result in side effects such as fluid retention and gynecomastia. Like other AAS, nandrolone decanoate has antigonadotropic effects. It has been found to suppress testosterone levels by 57% at a dosage of 100 mg/week and by 70% at a dosage of 300 mg/week in men following 6 weeks of treatment. Both the androgenic activity and the progestogenic activity of nandrolone decanoate may contribute to its antigonadotropic potency. Relative to testosterone, due to its lower estrogenic potency, much less of the antigonadotropic potency of nandrolone decanoate is derived from its estrogenic activity. =Pharmacokinetics= Upon intramuscular injection in oil, which results in the formation of a long- lasting depot in the muscle, nandrolone decanoate is stored unchanged and is slowly absorbed into the body. Once in the circulation, it is converted into nandrolone, which is the active form of the drug. There is a sharp spike in nandrolone levels 24 to 48 hours after an intramuscular injection of nandrolone decanoate, followed by a steady decline to baseline levels within approximately two or three weeks. The bioavailability of nandrolone decanoate is 53 to 73% with intramuscular injection and varies with the site of injection, with the highest bioavailability seen when injected into the gluteal muscle. Like testosterone, nandrolone is highly protein-bound and is present in the blood in both bound and free fractions. It has very low affinity for sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), about 5% of that of testosterone and 1% of that of DHT. Nandrolone decanoate is rapidly hydrolyzed in the blood by esterases into nandrolone, with a terminal half-life of one hour or less. It does not appear to be hydrolyzed in muscle or fat. The metabolism of nandrolone occurs in the liver and is very similar to that of testosterone, including reduction by 5α-reductase and 5β-reductase, dehydrogenation by 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and conjugation. The metabolites of nandrolone include 5α-dihydronandrolone, 19-norandrosterone, and 19-noretiocholanolone, with 19-norandrosterone being the major metabolite. Other metabolites include 19-norandrostenedione, 19-norandrostanediols, 19-norepiandrosterone, and conjugates. Nandrolone also undergoes aromatization into estradiol similarly to testosterone, though at a rate of only about 20% of that of testosterone or possibly even less; one study found virtually no aromatization of nandrolone in men. The elimination half-life of nandrolone decanoate administered by intramuscular injection is approximately 6 to 12 days. Studies that have assessed the duration of nandrolone decanoate via its anabolic effects, for instance on nitrogen balance, have found that a single 50 to 100 mg intramuscular injection had a duration of about 18 to 25 days. The blood half-life for the combined process of hydrolysis into nandrolone and elimination of nandrolone is 4.3 hours. Nandrolone and its metabolites are excreted in the urine, mainly in the form of conjugates. Although nandrolone decanoate is usually administered by intramuscular injection, it has been found to be similarly effective when administered by subcutaneous injection. The pharmacokinetics of nandrolone decanoate via subcutaneous injection closely resemble those of intramuscular injection. However, subcutaneous injection is considered to be easier, more convenient, and less painful compared to intramuscular injection. In addition, research suggests that most intramuscular injections in practice are in fact subcutaneous injections. Chemistry Nandrolone decanoate, or nandrolone 17β-decanoate, is a synthetic estrane steroid and a derivative of testosterone. It is an androgen ester; specifically, it is the C17β decylate (decanoate) ester of nandrolone (19-nortestosterone), which itself is the 19-demethylated analogue of testosterone. History Nandrolone decanoate was first described in the literature in 1960. It was developed by Organon and was introduced for medical use under the brand name Deca-Durabolin in 1962. Shortly thereafter it became one of the most widely used AAS in the world. Nandrolone decanoate was the second form of nandrolone to be introduced, having been preceded by nandrolone phenylpropionate in 1959. Society and culture=Generic names= Nandrolone decanoate is the generic name of the drug and its and . It has also been referred to as nandrolone decylate. =Brand names= Nandrolone decanoate is or has been marketed under the brand names Deca-Durabolin, Deca- Durabol, Decaneurabol, Metadec, and Retabolil, among others. =Availability= Nandrolone decanoate is available widely throughout the world, including in the United Kingdom, other European countries, Australia, New Zealand, Latin America, Asia, and elsewhere in the world. It has been discontinued in United States and Canada. Its availability is becoming increasingly limited with time. =Legal status= Nandrolone decanoate, along with other AAS, is a schedule III controlled substance in the United States under the Controlled Substances Act. Research Nandrolone decanoate has been studied in the treatment of bone loss in men, but in contrast to testosterone esters, was found to be ineffective. In short-term (6- to 8-week) studies in healthy male bodybuilders, nandrolone decanoate did not alter bone mineral density. However, the short duration of these studies limits conclusions on the influence of nandrolone decanoate on bone in men.

Interrupt storms are typically caused by hardware devices that do not support interrupt rate limiting. Background Because interrupt processing is typically a non-preemptible task in time-sharing operating systems, an interrupt storm will cause sluggish response to user input, or even appear to freeze the system completely. This state is commonly known as live lock. In such a state, the system is spending most of its resources processing interrupts instead of completing other work. To the end-user, it does not appear to be processing anything at all as there is often no output. An interrupt storm is sometimes mistaken for thrashing, since they both have similar symptoms (unresponsive or sluggish response to user input, little or no output). Common causes include: misconfigured or faulty hardware, faulty device drivers, flaws in the operating system, or metastability in one or more components. The latter condition rarely occurs outside of prototype or amateur-built hardware. Most modern hardware and operating systems have methods for mitigating the effect of an interrupt storm. For example, most Ethernet controllers implement interrupt \\"rate limiting\\", which causes the controller to wait a programmable amount of time between each interrupt it generates. When not present within the device, similar functionality is usually written into the device driver, and/or the operating system itself. The most common cause is when a device \\"behind\\" another signals an interrupt to an APIC (Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller). Most computer peripherals generate interrupts through an APIC as the number of interrupts is most always less (typically 15 for the modern PC) than the number of devices. The OS must then query each driver registered to that interrupt to ask if the interrupt originated from its hardware. Faulty drivers may always claim \\"yes\\", causing the OS to not query other drivers registered to that interrupt (only one interrupt can be processed at a time). The device which originally requested the interrupt therefore does not get its interrupt serviced, so a new interrupt is generated (or is not cleared) and the processor becomes swamped with continuous interrupt signals. Any operating system can live lock under an interrupt storm caused by such a fault. A kernel debugger can usually break the storm by unloading the faulty driver, allowing the driver \\"underneath\\" the faulty one to clear the interrupt, if user input is still possible. As drivers are most often implemented by a 3rd party, most operating systems also have a polling mode that queries for pending interrupts at fixed intervals or in a round-robin fashion. This mode can be set globally, on a per-driver, per-interrupt basis, or dynamically if the OS detects a fault condition or excessive interrupt generation. A polling mode may be enabled dynamically when the number of interrupts or the resource use caused by an interrupt, passes certain thresholds. When these thresholds are no longer exceeded, an OS may then change the interrupting driver, interrupt, or interrupt handling globally, from an interrupt mode to a polling mode. Interrupt rate limiting in hardware usually negates the use of a polling mode, but can still happen during normal operation during intense I/O if the processor is unable switch contexts quickly enough to keep pace.  History  Perhaps the first interrupt storm occurred during the Apollo 11's lunar descent in 1969.  Considerations  Interrupt rate limiting must be carefully configured for optimum results. For example, an Ethernet controller with interrupt rate limiting will buffer the packets it receives from the network in between each interrupt. If the rate is set too low, the controller's buffer will overflow, and packets will be dropped. The rate must take into account how fast the buffer may fill between interrupts, and the interrupt latency between the interrupt and the transfer of the buffer to the system.  Interrupt mitigating  There are hardware-based and software-based approaches to the problem. For example, FreeBSD detects interrupt storms and masks problematic interrupts for some time in response. The system used by NAPI is an example of the hardware-based approach: the system (driver) starts in interrupt enabled state, and the Interrupt handler then disables the interrupt and lets a thread/task handle the event(s) and then task polls the device, processing some number of events and enabling the interrupt. Another interesting approach using hardware support is one where the device generates interrupt when the event queue state changes from \\"empty\\" to \\"not empty\\". Then, if there are no free DMA descriptors at the RX FIFO tail, the device drops the event. The event is then added to the tail and the FIFO entry is marked as occupied. If at that point entry (tail−1) is free (cleared), an interrupt will be generated (level interrupt) and the tail pointer will be incremented. If the hardware requires the interrupt be acknowledged, the CPU (interrupt handler) will do that, handle the valid DMA descriptors at the head, and return from the interrupt.

Superbases are valuable in organic chemistry, which abounds in very weak acids. Reactions involving superbases often require special techniques since they're easily destroyed by water, atmospheric carbon dioxide, and, often, oxygen. A common superbase is lithium diisopropylamide. Definitions A \\"superbase\\" has been defined as an organic compound whose basicity is greater than that of proton sponge, which has a conjugate pKa of 12.1. Strong superbases can be prepared from extending the hydrogen bond network of multiple amino groups substituted on an aromatic core. Superbases are of great interest to practicing organic chemists due to their reactivity as well as good solubility in organic solvents. IUPAC broadly defines a superbase as a \\"compound having a very high basicity, such as lithium diisopropylamide.\\" Caubère defines superbases as \\"bases resulting from a mixing of two (or more) bases leading to new basic species possessing inherent new properties. The term superbase does not mean a base is thermodynamically and/or kinetically stronger than another, instead it means that a basic reagent is created by combining the characteristics of several different bases.\\" Superbases have also been defined semi- quantitatively as any species with a higher absolute proton affinity (APA = 245.3 kcal/mol) and intrinsic gas phase basicity (GB = 239 kcal/mol) than Alder's canonical proton sponge (1,8-bis-(dimethylamino)-naphthalene). Superbases have been described and used since the 1850s. Organic superbases Protonation of Verkade base. Its conjugate acid has a pKa of 32.9 in acetonitrile. Organic superbases are almost always charge-neutral, amine- containing species. Despite enormous proton affinity, some organosuperbases exhibit low nucleophilicity. Increasingly important in organic synthesis, these include the phosphazenes, amidines, and guanidines. Other organic compounds also meet the physicochemical or structural definitions of 'superbase'. Proton chelators like the aromatic proton sponges and the bispidines are also superbases. Multicyclic polyamines, like DABCO might also be loosely included in this category.Superbases for Organic Synthesis Ed. Ishikawa, T., John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.: West Sussex, UK. 2009. =Organometallic= Deprotonation using LDA . Organometallic compounds of electropositive metals are superbases, but they are generally strong nucleophiles. Examples include organolithium and organomagnesium (Grignard reagent) compounds. Another type of organometallic superbase has a reactive metal exchanged for a hydrogen on a heteroatom, such as oxygen (unstabilized alkoxides) or nitrogen (metal amides such as lithium diisopropylamide). The Schlosser base (or Lochmann-Schlosser base), the combination of n-butyllithium and potassium tert-butoxide, is commonly cited as a superbase. n-Butyllithium and potassium tert-butoxide form a mixed aggregate of greater reactivity than either component reagent. =Inorganic= Inorganic superbases are typically salt-like compounds with small, highly charged anions, e.g. lithium hydride, potassium hydride, and sodium hydride.

It was a finalist for the National Book Award in 1962, along with Catch-22 and The Moviegoer. When published by Atlantic- Little, Brown in 1961, it received critical acclaim, and The New York Times reviewed it as \\"beautifully crafted... a remarkable and deeply troubling book.\\" In 2005, the novel was chosen by TIME as one of the 100 best English- language novels from 1923 to the present.\\"All-Time 100 Novels\\", Time, 2005. When DeWitt Henry and Geoffrey Clark interviewed Yates for the Winter 1972 issue of literary journal Ploughshares, Yates detailed the title's subtext: A film adaptation of the book, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, and Kathy Bates, directed by Sam Mendes, and written by Justin Haythe, was released in 2008.  Plot summary  Set in 1955, the novel focuses on the hopes and aspirations of Frank and April Wheeler, self-assured Connecticut suburbanites who see themselves as very different from their neighbors in the Revolutionary Hill Estates. In the opening scene, April stars in an embarrassingly bad amateur dramatic production of The Petrified Forest. After the performance, Frank and April have a fight on the side of the highway, and Frank later begins an affair with his office colleague Maureen Grube. Seeking to break out of their suburban rut (and consequently blaming herself for all of Frank's \\"problems\\"), April convinces Frank they should move to Paris, where she will work and support him while he realizes his vague ambition to be something other than an office worker. The promise of France brings the two together in love and excitement again, and Frank seemingly ends his relationship with Maureen. While April sees the emigration as an opportunity to escape their bland environment, Frank's plans are more driven by vanity of his own intelligence, which April panders to. When the dull and prim neighbor Mrs. Givings begins bringing her \\"insane\\" son John around to the Wheelers' house for regular lunches, John's honest and erratic condemnation of his mother's suburban lifestyle strikes a chord with the Wheelers, particularly Frank. Their plans to leave the United States begin to crumble when April conceives their third child, and Frank begins to identify with his mundane job when the prospect of a promotion arises. After arguing over the possibility of aborting the child, Frank tries to manipulate April into seeking psychiatric help for her troubled childhood. April, overwhelmed by the situation, suffers something of an identity crisis and sleeps with her neighbor Shep Campbell, while Frank resurrects his relationship with Maureen. April attempts to self- abort her child, and in doing so is rushed to the hospital and dies from blood loss. Frank, scarred by the ordeal and feeling deep guilt over the outcome, is left a hollow shell of a man. He and his children spent time living with their uncle, hence mirroring the youth of their mother.John Mullan,\\"Left unsaid\\", The Guardian, September 18, 2004. Themes In the October 1999 issue of the Boston Review, Yates was quoted on his central theme: \\"If my work has a theme, I suspect it is a simple one: that most human beings are inescapably alone, and therein lies their tragedy.\\" For all their personal hopes and dreams, Frank and April are unable to communicate them to each other; this syndrome is also seen in the other characters, Shep and Milly Campbell, and Mr. and Mrs. Givings. The Wheelers' frustrations and yearnings for something better represent the tattered remnants of the American Dream.  Literary significance  Stewart O'Nan probed the neglect of Yates in \\"The Lost World of Richard Yates: How the Great Writer of the Age of Anxiety Disappeared from Print\\".Stewart O'Nan. \\"The Lost World of Richard Yates: How the Great Writer of the Age of Anxiety Disappeared from Print\\".

William Styron, who once gave a reading of the novel's opening chapter at Boston University, called Revolutionary Road \\"a deft, ironic, beautiful novel that deserves to be a classic.\\" Kurt Vonnegut called it \\"The Great Gatsby of my time... one of the best books by a member of my generation.\\" Tennessee Williams also praised the book: \\"Here is more than fine writing; here is what, added to fine writing, makes a book come immediately, intensely and brilliantly alive. If more is needed to make a masterpiece in modern American fiction, I am sure I don't know what it is.\\"  Film adaptation  Screenwriter Justin Haythe adapted the novel for filming, which was directed by Sam Mendes, stars Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio, and co-stars Kathy Bates and Michael Shannon.\\"Revolutionary Road (2008)\\".

In 2009, he was appointed Honorary Chairman of the CSU. Early life Waigel was born as the son of a small-time farmer from the Swabian village of Oberrohr. When he was 6, his older brother, August, was killed in France during World War 2.Nathaniel C. Nash (November 29, 1995), Club Europe's Tough Doorman New York Times. Member of the Bundestag, 1972–2002 Waigel first became a Member of the German Bundestag in the 1972 federal elections. From 1980 to 1982, he served as spokesperson of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group on economic affairs. He was the group's deputy chairman from 1982 until 1989. In this capacity, he also served as the leader of the Bundestag group of CSU parliamentarians. Federal Minister of Finance, 1989–1998 In a 1989 cabinet reshuffle, Chancellor Helmut Kohl named Waigel as new Federal Minister of Finance, replacing Gerhard Stoltenberg. During his time in office, his state secretaries included leading economists Horst Köhler (1990-1993) and Jürgen Stark (1995-1998), among others. =German reunification= During his time in office, Waigel oversaw the early economic integration of East Germany after the fall of Communism. He not only had to impose enormous new taxes on the German public, but he also had to keep the country's budget deficit from ballooning while Germany was spending $150 billion a year to rebuild the east.Nathaniel C. Nash (November 29, 1995), Club Europe's Tough Doorman New York Times. In March 1990, Waigel publicly announced that his Government's policy was considering a proposal by its central bank, the Bundesbank, for conversion at a rate of one Deutsche mark for every two East marks, with an exception for a small portion of personal savings. In response, hundreds of thousands of East Germans to protest the plan, including about 10,000 in East Berlin, who took to the Palace of the Republic, where the newly elected Parliament was holding its inaugural meeting.Ferdinand Protzman (April 6, 1990), Bonn Works on Money Plan Amid Protests in East New York Times. Chancellor Helmut Kohl said that was not the policy after all.David Rosenbaum (April 5, 1990), Group of 7 Meeting Is Expected to Be Quiet New York Times. On 19 May 1990, Waigel and his East German counterpart Walter Romberg signed a state treaty to merge their economies and make the West German mark the sole legal currency in both nations by 2 July 1990. In July 1990, Waigel joined Kohl and Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher on a trip to Moscow for meeting President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, where both worked to convince the Soviet leader to drop his remaining objections to German unification within NATO.Craig R. Whitney (July 14, 1990), Evolution in Europe; Kohl Will Meet Gorbachev Today in Moscow on Unity New York Times. On 9 August 1990, Waigel announced that West Germany's 1990 budget would be its last and that he was withdrawing the Cabinet draft for the 1991 budget to make way for an all- German budget consonant with unification.David Binder (August 10, 1990), German Leaders Agree On Elections on Dec. 2 New York Times. Later that year, he said that borrowing by Government, state and local authorities would total up to $95 billion the following year, nearly five times the equivalent figure for West Germany in 1989.Ferdinand Protzman (November 16, 1990), Evolution in Europe: Kohl Pledges Help in Soviet Food Crisis New York Times. Between 1989 and 1991 alone, the central government's budget deficit soared from 0.5 percent of national income to 5 percent.Germany’s great survivor European Voice, October 25, 1995. Following a proposal developed by Waigel, the Kohl government agreed in February 1991 to an unexpectedly large package of tax increases – including a 7.5 percent surcharge on personal income and corporate tax payments – to help pay for reunification, as well as the government's contribution to the allied forces during the Gulf War and aid to Eastern Europe's fledgling democracies.Ferdinand Protzman (February 27, 1991), Bonn Sets Big Tax Rise For Unity and Gulf Aid New York Times.

In the subsequent years, however, both CDU and CSU favored increasing taxes, fearing the consequences of further budgetary cuts; by 1997, the government was already in danger of breaking a Constitutional Court ruling that spending on public investment must exceed the budget deficit.

After Germany and France failed to get the 18th G7 summit to agree on ways to assure the safety of deteriorating nuclear power plants in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, Waigel pledged that public funds from the West would nonetheless be mobilized not simply to repair dangerous plants but \\"to change the whole energy policy in these states so they can conserve energy, develop alternative energy sources and thereby create more leeway for shutting down plants that are unsafe.\\"Stephen Kinzer (July 8, 1992), Summit In Munich; 7 Leaders Divided On A-Plant Safety New York Times. =Introduction of the Euro= Under the leadership of Kohl and Waigel, the adoption of a common currency became central to Germany's goals of political and economic integration in Europe.Alan Cowell (September 22, 1995), Europe's Dream of Common Currency: A German Warning Shot New York Times. At the height of speculative attacks on the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) in 1992-93, acting closely with his then counterpart Michel Sapin of France, Waigel repulsed speculators trying to break the French franc's parity with the Deutsche Mark by selling marks en masse until the bank traders gave up.Daniel Flynn (May 14, 2012), \\"Head chopper\\" tipped for French finance minister Reuters.Robert Chote Andrew Marshall and Peter Torday (September 23, 1992), Last-ditch defence of ERM: France pours out foreign currency reserves to defend the sliding franc The Independent. Throughout the 1990s, Waigel was seeking to assure a skeptical German public as well as small companies and banks that the new currency would be as stable as the Deutsche Mark, which had become a symbol of Germany's economic hegemony in Europe at the time.Tom Buerkle (September 19, 1995), Paris-Bonn Currency Dispute Deepens International Herald Tribune. In September 1995, Waigel first proposed that countries adopting a single currency agree to reinforce rules on budget deficits and impose financial sanctions against deficit violators that go beyond the penalties included in the Maastricht Treaty.Tom Buerkle (September 19, 1995), Paris-Bonn Currency Dispute Deepens International Herald Tribune. Also in September 1995, Waigel first floated Euro as the name of the new single currency. He later overruled the French government with his proposal; France had favored want the name ECU, the European Currency Unit which was used in many accounts and the issuance of some debt at the time.Nathaniel C. Nash (November 28, 1995), With a European Currency, The Currency Is Conflict New York Times. The name \\"Euro\\" was later chosen for the new currency at the European Council in Madrid. In a move to reduce government spending, Waigel led the call for a reduction in Germany's contributions to the budget of the European Union in 1996. He wrote to Kohl pointing out that contributions from Germany made up about 60 percent of the EU's regional and structural funds and urging him to push for a cut in Germany's burden.Thomas Klau (November 6, 1996), to cut Germany’s EU burden European Voice. In 1998, he joined fellow finance ministers Gerrit Zalm of the Netherlands, Rudolf Edlinger of Austria and Erik Åsbrink of Sweden urging President of the European Commission Jacques Santer to cap the proportion of a country's income which goes to the EU as part of his Agenda 2000 spending review.Tim Jones (May 27, 1998), Santer moves to pacify EU’s biggest paymasters European Voice. After his failed attempt to pressure Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer into a quick revaluation of the country's gold reserves in order to bring Germany's budget deficit into line with the criteria for the single currency, Waigel had to confront a parliamentary motion against him on 4 June 1997.

In November 1997, Waigel imposed the strictest budget freeze in the country's history, in a last-ditch effort to fulfill the Euro convergence criteria. The freeze, which lasted until the end of that year, was imposed to save the government a further one billion marks ($578.2 million).Matt Marshall (October 31, 1997), Waigel Imposes Budget Freeze To Fulfill EMU Entry Criteria Wall Street Journal.

During what turned into a bitter struggle, it was revealed that he was estranged from his wife and had been in a long-standing relationship with former Olympic skier Irene Epple.

In late 1995, Waigel was re-elected to the CSU leadership with 95 percent of the vote.Germany’s great survivor European Voice, October 25, 1995.

Biography Ma was born in Qingdao, a city in Shandong Province on China's Yellow Sea coast, on 18 August 1953. As a child, he was the pupil of a painter who had been persecuted as a Rightist. After his school education was cut short by the Cultural Revolution, he studied by himself, copying out a Chinese dictionary word by word. At fifteen, he joined a propaganda arts troupe, and was later assigned a job as a watchmender's apprentice. For a few years he worked in a petrochemical plant near Beijing, then in 1979, moved to the capital and became a photojournalist for a magazine published by the All China Federation of Trade Unions. During this time, he joined the 'underground' No Name art group, the Yuanmingyuan poetry group, and the April photographers' group. He held clandestine exhibitions of his paintings in his one-room shack in Nanxiao Lane, which became a meeting point for dissident artists and writers of Beijing. In 1983, his paintings were denounced during the Anti-Spiritual Pollution Campaign, and he was placed in detention. After his release, he resigned from his job and set off on a three-year journey through China, selling his paintings and stories as he went. When he returned to Beijing in 1986, he wrote Stick Out Your Tongue, a novella inspired by his travels through Tibet. Its publication in the official journal People's Literature in February 1987 coincided with a nationwide crackdown on the arts, and the government publicly denounced the work as an example of Bourgeois liberalism. All copies of the journal were confiscated and destroyed, and a blanket ban was placed on the future publications of Ma Jian's books. Just before this event, Ma Jian had moved to Hong Kong, where speech freedoms are much higher. He wrote Bardo, a novel about two doomed lovers who are reincarnated through Chinese history, and The Nine Crossroads, about a group of sent-down youth who are sent to a remote mountain inhabited by a primitive tribe. In 1989, Ma Jian returned to Beijing and took part in the democracy protests. After the Tiananmen massacre, he remained in the capital and wrote The Noodle Maker, a dark political satire. For the next few years, he travelled back and forth between Hong Kong and China, editing, briefly, the Hong Kong arts magazine, Wen Yi Bao, and setting up 'New Era' publishing company and the literary journal 'Trends', which published essays and novels banned in China. After the Handover of Hong Kong to China in 1997, Ma Jian moved to Germany to take up a post teaching Chinese literature at Ruhr University, and to work on Beijing Coma, a novel about the Tiananmen massacre and the decade of political repression and economic growth that followed it.Holbrook Pierson, Melissa. \\"Strong Medicine\\", review of Beijing Coma, The Nation, 4/11 August 2008, p. 34–36. In 1999, he moved to London and wrote Red Dust, a fictionalised account of his journey through China in the 1980s, which won the 2002 Thomas Cook Travel Book Award. He returned to China regularly, and resumed work on Beijing Coma, which was finally published in 2008 and won the 2009 Index on Censorship T.R. Fyvel Book Award and the 2010 Athens Prize for Literature. In 2008–2009, he travelled extensively through the remote interior of China to research The Dark Road, a novel that explores the One Child Policy, published by Chatto & Windus and Penguin in 2013. In 2001, he collaborated in founding the Independent Chinese PEN Centre, a branch of PEN International, became its board member in 2003–2005 and 2009–2011, a member of its Freedom to Write Committee since 2003, and director of its Press & Translation Committee since 2011. Ma Jian is a vocal critic of China's Communist regime. His works explore themes and subjects that are taboo in China. He has continually called for greater freedom of expression and the release of jailed writers and other political prisoners. As a result, his books have been banned in China for the last 25 years, and since the summer of 2011, he has been denied entry into the mainland. Despite the restrictions placed on him, Ma Jian has become a leading Chinese writer, internationally distinguished with his works translated into a great number of languages, including English, French, Spanish, German, Swedish, Norwegian, Catalan, Japanese, Dutch, Hebrew, Romanian, Turkish, Greek, Polish, Korean, Italian and Portuguese. In April 2012, while attending the London Book Fair, Ma used red paint to smear a cross over his face and a copy of his banned book Beijing Coma and called his Chinese publisher a \\"mouthpiece of the Chinese communist party\\" after being \\"manhandled\\" while attempting to present the book to the director of the General Administration of Press and Publication and the director of National Copyright Administration, Liu Binjie, at the fair. In November 2018, Ma was a guest at the Hong Kong International Literary Festival. Tai Kwun, the venue for the events, initially cancelled his two talks, because it did not want to \\"become a platform to promote the political interests of any individual\\", but subsequently reversed course. The incident sparked public outcry in Hong Kong. Many related this with the recent Victor Mallet visa controversy and the cancellation of Badiucao's exhibition, complaining that China was covertly silencing critics in the autonomous territory and curbing her autonomy. He lives in London with his partner and translator, Flora Drew, and their four children. Work Ma came to the attention of the English-speaking world with his story collection Stick Out Your Tongue, translated into English in 2006. The stories are set in Tibet. Their most remarked-upon feature is that traditional Tibetan culture is not idealised, but rather depicted as harsh and often inhuman; one reviewer noted that the \\"stories sketch multi-generational incest, routine sexual abuse and ritual rape\\". The book was banned in China as a \\"vulgar and obscene book that defames the image of our Tibetan compatriots.\\" Ma's travel memoir Red Dust: A Path Through China (2001) is about his wanderings through remote areas of China from 1983–86 as a long-haired jobless vagabond. It won the 2002 Thomas Cook Travel Book Award. His novel Beijing Coma (2008) tells the story of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 from the point of view of the fictional Dai Wei, a participant in the events left in a coma by the violent end of the protests. The comatose narrator functions as a metaphor for the ability to remember and the inability to act. It has received critical acclaim, with Tom Deveson of The Times describing it as \\"epic in scope but intimate in feeling … magnificent\\" and the Financial Times calling it \\"an epic yet intimate work that deserves to be recognised and to endure as the great Tienanmen novel.” Awards and honours * 2002 Thomas Cook Travel Book Award * 2009 China Free Culture Prize * 2009 Index on Censorship TR Fyvel Book Award * 2010 Athens Prize for Literature List of works Books of short stories and novellas * Stick Out Your Tongue (亮出你的舌苔或空空荡荡) (1987) banned in China, English version: Chatto & Windus and Farrar, Straus & Giroux (2006) * A Dog's Life (你拉狗屎) (1987) * The Lament (怨碑) (1996) Novels * Bardo (思惑) (1989) * The Noodle Maker (拉面者) (1991), English version: Chatto & Windus (2004) and Farrar, Straus & Giroux (2005) * The Nine Crossroads (九条叉路) (1993) * Red Dust (红尘) (2003), English version: Chatto & Windus and Pantheon Books (2001) * Beijing Coma (肉之土) (2009) banned in China, English version: Chatto & Windus and Farrar, Straus and Giroux (2008) * The Dark Road (阴之道), Yun chi dao (2012), Taipei: Yun Chen Publishing.

He brought chemistry under quantum mechanics through his theory of valence bonding. Education In 1922, Heitler began his study of physics at the Karlsruhe Technische Hochschule, in 1923 at the Humboldt University of Berlin, and in 1924 at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU), where he studied under both Arnold Sommerfeld and Karl Herzfeld. The latter was his thesis advisor when he obtained his doctorate in 1926; – Dr. phil. Ludwig- Maximilians-Universität München. 1926 Dissertation title: Zur Theorie konzentrierter Lösungen. Herzfeld taught courses in theoretical physics and one in physical chemistry, and in Sommerfeld's absence often took over his classes.Karl Herzfeld From 1926 to 1927, he was a Rockefeller Foundation Fellow for postgraduate research with Niels Bohr at the Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of Copenhagen and with Erwin Schrödinger at the University of Zurich. He then became an assistant to Max Born at the Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of Göttingen. Heitler completed his Habilitation, under Born, in 1929, and then remained as a Privatdozent until 1933.Author Catalog: Heitler – American Philosophical Society In that year, he was let go by the university because he was Jewish.Uta Schäfer-Richter, Jörg Klein (1992), p. 93 At the time Heitler received his doctorate, three Institutes for Theoretical Physics formed a consortium which worked on the key problems of the day, such as atomic and molecular structure, and exchanged both scientific information and personnel in their scientific quests. These institutes were located at the LMU, under Arnold Sommerfeld, the University of Göttingen, under Max Born, and the University of Copenhagen, under Niels Bohr. Furthermore, Werner Heisenberg and Born had just recently published their trilogy of papers which launched the matrix mechanics formulation of quantum mechanics.W.

[English translation in Gunter Ludwig Wave Mechanics 127–150 (Pergamon Press, 1968) ] These papers immediately put the personnel at the leading theoretical physics institutes onto applying these new tools to understanding atomic and molecular structure. It was in this environment that Heitler went on his Rockefeller Foundations Fellowship, leaving LMU and within a period of two years going to do research and study with the leading figures of the day in theoretical physics, Bohr's personnel in Copenhagen, Schrödinger in Zurich, and Born in Göttingen. In Zurich, with Fritz London, Heitler applied the new quantum mechanics to deal with the saturable, nondynamic forces of attraction and repulsion, i.e., exchange forces, of the hydrogen molecule. Their valence bond treatment of this problem, was a landmark in that it brought chemistry under quantum mechanics. Furthermore, their work greatly influenced chemistry through Linus Pauling, who had just received his doctorate and on a Guggenheim Fellowship visited Heitler and London in Zurich, as Pauling spent much of his career studying the nature of the chemical bond. The application of quantum mechanics to chemistry would be a prominent theme in Heitler's career.Mehra, Volume 5, Part 1, 2001, p. 312.Pauling – Oregon State UniversityJammer, 1966, p. 343. While Heitler was at Göttingen, Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933. With the rising prominence of anti-Semitism under Hitler, Born took it upon himself to take the younger Jewish generation under his wing.The younger generation of Jewish physicists included Walter Heitler, Lothar Nordheim, Fritz London, and Edward Teller. See Greenspan, 2005, p. 183. In doing so, Born arranged for Heitler to get a position that year as a Research Fellow at the University of Bristol, with Nevill Francis Mott.Greenspan, 2005, p. 183.Mott – Bristol Physics in the 1930s Career At Bristol, Heitler was a Research Fellow of the Academic Assistance Council, in the H. H. Wills Physics Laboratory. At Bristol, among other things, he worked on quantum field theory and quantum electrodynamics on his own, as well as in collaboration with other scientific refugees from Hitler, such as Hans Bethe and Herbert Fröhlich, who also left Germany in 1933.Fröhlich, Heitler, Kemmer. With Bethe, he published a paper on pair production of gamma rays in the Coulomb field of an atomic nucleus, in which they developed the Bethe-Heitler formula for Bremsstrahlung. Heitler also contributed to the understanding of cosmic rays,Homi Jahangir Bhabha as well as predicted the existence of the electrically neutral pi meson. In 1936, Heitler published his major work on quantum electrodynamics, The Quantum Theory of Radiation, which marked the direction for future developments in quantum theory.Moore, 1992, p. 376. The book appeared in many editions and printings and has been translated into Russian. After the fall of France in 1940, Heitler was briefly interned on the Isle of Man for several months.Moore, 1992, p. 368. Heitler remained at Bristol eight years, until 1941, when he became a professor at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, which was arranged there by Erwin Schrödinger, Director of the School for Theoretical Physics.Walter Heitler: the forgotten hero of Éamon de Valera’s science push The Irish Times, Oct 15, 2015Heitler – Irish University Science He has been described as the \\"unsung hero of DIAS in the 1940s\\".https://www.irishtimes.com/news/science/walter-heitler-the- forgotten-hero-of-%C3%A9amon-de-valera-s-science-push-1.2380717?mode=amp At Dublin, Heitler's work with H.

S. E. Hickson took notes and prepared a finished copy. These notes were the basis for Heitler's book Elementary Wave Mechanics: Introductory Course of Lectures, first published in 1943. A new edition was published as Elementary Wave Mechanics in 1945. This version was revised and republished many times, as well as being translated into French and Italian and published in 1949 and in German in 1961. A further revised version appeared as Elementary Wave Mechanics With Applications to Quantum Chemistry in 1956, as well as in German in 1961. Schrödinger resigned as Director of the School for Theoretical Physics in 1946, but stayed at Dublin, whereupon Heitler became Director. Heitler stayed at Dublin until 1949, when he accepted a position as Ordinarius Professor for Theoretical Physics and Director of the Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of Zurich, where he remained until 1974, when he retired. In 1958, Heitler held the Lorentz Chair for Theoretical Physics at the University of Leiden.Lorentz Chair – 1958 Walter Heitler While in Zurich, after some years, he began writing on the philosophical relationship of science to religion.Moore, 1992, p. 445.

Relationships Myotis has historically been included in the subfamily Vespertilioninae, but was classified in its own subfamily, Myotinae, by Nancy Simmons in 1998. In her 2005 classification in Mammal Species of the World, Simmons listed the genera Cistugo and Lasionycteris in the Myotinae in addition to Myotis itself.Simmons, 2005, p. 499 However, molecular data indicate that Cistugo is distantly related to all other Vespertilionidae, so it was reclassified into its own family, the Cistugidae,Lack et al., 2010 and that Lasionycteris belongs in the Vespertilioninae.Roehrs et al., 2010 The genus Submyotodon has since been added to the subfamily, making it and Myotis its only members. Appearance and behavior Their ears are normally longer than they are wide, with a long and lance-shaped tragus, hence their English and zoological names (in Greek, myotis and myosotis mean \\"mouse-ear\\"). The species within this genus vary in size from very large to very small for vesper bats, with a single pair of mammary glands. Mouse-eared bats are generally insectivores. M. vivesi, and several members of the trawling bat ecomorph Leuconoe, have relatively large feet with long toes, and take small fish from the water surface (they also take insects).Levin, E.; A. Barnea; Y. Yovel; and Y. Yom-Tov (2006). Have introduced fish initiated piscivory among the long-fingered bat? Mammalian Biology 71(3): 139–143. Longevity Myotis species are remarkably long-lived for their size; in 2018, researchers revealed that a longitudinal study appears to indicate that Myotis telomeres do not shrink with age, and that telomerase does not appear to be present in the Myotis metabolism.Growing old, yet staying young: The role of telomeres in bats’ exceptional longevity, These Bats Don't Seem to Die of Old Age—Can They Help Extend the Human Lifespan?, by Kate Lunau, at Vice; published February 7, 2018; retrieved June 12, 2018 Species Traditionally, Myotis has been divided into three large subgenera—Leuconoe, Myotis, and Selysius. However, molecular data indicate that these subgenera are not natural groups, but instead unnatural assemblages of convergently similar species.Simmons, 2005, p. 500 Instead, Myotis species largely fall in two main clades, one containing Old World and the other New World species. However, the Asian species Myotis latirostris falls outside the clade formed by these main groups, and may represent a separate genus,Lack et al., 2010, p. 984 and the Eurasian Myotis brandtii is related to New World species.Stadelmann et al., 2007, fig. 2 Myotis is a highly species-rich genus, and the classification of many species remains unsettled.

Life Born in the Netherlands, he attended school at Düsseldorf and Essen, studied for half a year at the University of Münster, and then moved to the University of Bonn, where his teachers included Friedrich Diez and Nicolaus Delius. After finishing his doctoral dissertation, \\"Coniectanea in historiam rei metricae Francogallicae,\\" he began to lecture at the University of Münster on the philology of the English and Romance languages, and defended his post-doctoral thesis (Habilitation) on the Roman de Rou. In 1870 he became professor of modern languages at the University of Marburg, and after the reconstitution of Strassburg University as Kaiser-Wilhelm-Universität was appointed the very first Professor of English on the European continent. In 1874 he began to edit, in collaboration with Wilhelm Scherer, Ernst Martin and Erich Schmidt, Quellen und Forschungen zur Sprach- und Kulturgeschichte der germanischen Völker, a book series meant to assist the German government in the Germanizing of Strasbourg and Alsace-Lorraine. While he continued to lecture on French and English literature, he smartly focused his research on the father of English poetry, Geoffrey Chaucer. In 1877, he published Chaucer: Studien zur Geschichte seiner Entwickelung und zur Chronologie seiner Schriften, a study which analyzed Chaucer's literary models and verse forms to determine the later widely accepted division of the poet's works into three periods: a first period during which he was mostly influenced by French models as well as by Ovid; a second period during which his main inspiration came from Italian models (Dante, Boccaccio, Petrarch); and a third period of mature literary production. In 1884, he published Chaucers Sprache und Verskunst, the first full-fledged investigation of Chaucer's grammar and metrics and an achievement that guaranteed him a place of honor as recently as 1987, in the General Bibliography of the Riverside Chaucer, the most widely used edition of Chaucer in the world. English-language publishing houses, such as Henry Holt & Company, N.Y., and G. Bell & Sons, London, published English translations of his works on Early English Literature during these years. He also published critical editions of the General Prologue of the Canterbury Tales and the Compleynte unto Pity. Ten Brink's work stimulated a revival of Chaucer study in the United Kingdom as well as in Germany, and to him was indirectly due the foundation of the English Chaucer Society. In addition, he made important contributions to the study of Shakespeare and Beowulf and authored one of the first scholarly histories of English literature. His international scholarly reputation as well as his efforts at Germanizing the University of Strasbourg contributed to his appointment as Rektor (President) of his institution in 1890. Together with Julius Zupitza, Eugen Kölbing, and Ewald Flügel, ten Brink helped found modern English Studies.

They are easily identified by their large size, black and white plumage and distinctive yellow crown and hindneck. The pale blue bill is pointed with fine serrations near the tip; perhaps because of the depth and speed of the gannet's dive when fishing (depending on altitude, gannets hit the water at speeds of between ,Beak Protects during Dives: Cape Gannet, AskNature its beak has no external nostrils into which the water might be forced. Taxonomy German naturalist Hinrich Lichtenstein described the Cape gannet in 1823. The Sulidae, the gannets and boobies, appeared about 30 million years ago. Early Sulidae fossils most resembled the boobies, although they were more aquatic, with the gannets splitting off later, about 16 million years ago. The gannets evolved in the northern hemisphere, later colonising the southern oceans. The most ancient extant species may be the Abbott's booby, possibly the sole survivor of an otherwise extinct separate lineage. A 2011 genetic study of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA suggests that the ancestor of the gannets arose around 2.5 million years ago before splitting into northern and southern lineages. The latter then splitting into the Cape and Australasian gannets around 0.5 million years ago. The three gannets are generally considered to be separate species forming a superspecies, though they have also formerly been classified as subspecies of the northern gannet (Sula bassanus). Description When seen in flight the snow-white body with the black tail, primaries and secondaries, and dark bill makes them easy to identify. At closer range the distinctive golden crown and nape, which gradually becomes white on the neck, is noticeable. Juveniles and immatures are dark brown with a pale bill, and can resemble the dark-coloured boobies at first glance. Adults are about long and have a wingspan and weigh ca. . The Cape gannet is identified from the Australasian gannet by the all-black tail, a longer black stripe down the throat (from underneath the beak) and more extensive black on the face, but all of these features are difficult to identify unless at close proximity. The Cape gannet is also very similar to the northern gannet, but the latter differs from its entirely white tail and its wings, which are only black at the tip. It also is similar to the blue-footed booby (Sula nebouxii). Breeding Gannet pairs may remain together over several seasons. They perform elaborate greeting rituals at the nest, stretching their bills and necks skywards and gently tapping bills together. Cape gannets begin breeding in August or September. Typically the clutch is a single bluish egg, which soon becomes soiled. Both parents are actively involved in the incubation process which lasts for 42 to 46 days until hatching. Gannets use their foot webs to incubate the egg. The foot webs, which are richly irrigated with blood vessels are wrapped around the egg. The hatchling is black, naked and blind, it weighs only about , but within three weeks its body mass is one third of that of an adult. At eight weeks the chick outweighs the adult, and this remains so until it becomes a fledgling at 95–105 days of age. Feeding Cape gannets are powerful fliers, using mainly a flap-gliding technique, which is more energy consuming than the dynamic-soaring favoured by albatrosses. As all Sulids, they are fish-eating birds that plunge-dive from considerable height. Status and distribution=Breeding and non-breeding range= The breeding range of the Cape gannet is restricted to southern Africa in three islands off Namibia and three islands off South Africa. They normally nest in large and dense colonies on flat islands or on flat ledges of the steeply sloping Mercury Island off Namibia. The world population was estimated in 1996 to number about 340,000 birds, with 12% in Namibia and 88% in South Africa. The largest colony of this bird, with over 140,000 birds, is found on Malgas Island, South Africa. Several birds have occasionally been found breeding on offshore Australian islands, together with Australasian gannets, although the Cape species is never represented by more than a few pairs. The non-breeding range of the Cape gannet extends from the coastal waters off the Gulf of Guinea on the west coast of Africa, to Mozambique on the east coast. They seldom occur farther offshore than 100 km, though records of birds more than 200 km offshore exist for both the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. =Population trends= Numbers of Cape gannets at the Namibian islands have declined considerably between 1956 and 2000 from 114,600 to 18,200 breeding pairs respectively, an 84% decrease in less than fifty years. This contrasts with the trends at the South African islands where numbers have increased about 4.3 times during the same period, from 34,400 to 148,000 breeding pairs. =Vagrancy= Vagrancy to the northern Atlantic Ocean has been reported for the Cape gannet on several occasions, but is currently believed to be unproven.Paterson A.M. and N.J. Riddiford (1990). \\"Does the Cape Gannet Enter European Waters?\\" British Birds 83(12):519–526. Crochet and HaasCrochet, Pierre-André and Marcel Haas (2008). Western Palearctic list update: deletion of Cape Gannet Dutch Birding 30(2):103–4. examined the status of the species in the western Palearctic realm. They list a number of historical claims which had not been accepted by national bird records committees, and analyse the single record which had hitherto been widely accepted, a juvenile recovered offshore from Western Sahara in 1966. In relation to the latter bird, they conclude that a mistake had occurred; the original data placed the bird inland, in Chad, with the offshore Western Saharan location being the result of an attempt to correct this to a more plausible location. A retransposition of the original latitude and longitude gives a location off the Namibian coast, well within the regular wintering range of the species. As a result, they recommend that the Cape gannet be deleted from the Western Palearctic list. References=Cited text= * Further reading *Crawford (1997). Cape Gannet.

It stretches over an area of comprising scrub-thorn arid forests, dry deciduous forests, grasslands, and rocky hills. This area was a hunting preserve of the Alwar state and was declared a wildlife reserve in 1955. It was given the status of a tiger reserve making it a part of India's Project Tiger in 1978. The wildlife sanctuary was declared a national park in 1990, with a total area of about . It is the first reserve in the world with successfully relocated tigers. It is an important biodiversity area in the Northern Aravalli leopard and wildlife corridor. The park is situated away from Hindaun, from Jaipur and from Delhi. It is a part of the Aravalli Range and the Khathiar-Gir dry deciduous forests ecoregion. It is rich in mineral resources, such as copper. In spite of the Supreme Court's 1991 ban on mining in the area, marble mining continues to threaten the environment. General information Water body within the Sariska Reserve, Rajasthan. *Area: *Elevation: between *Rainfall: average per year *Forest types: tropical, dry, deciduous, and tropical thorn Flora The dominant tree in the forests is dhok (Anogeissus pendula). Other trees include the salar (Boswellia serrata), kadaya (Sterculia urens), dhak (Butea monosperma), gol (Lannea coromandelica), ber (Ziziphus mauritiana) and khair (Acacia catechu). Bargad (Ficus benghalensis), arjun (Terminalia arjuna), gugal (Commiphora wightii) or bamboo. Shrubs are numerous, such as kair (Capparis decidua), adusta (Adhatoda vesica) and jhar ber (Ziziphus nummularia). Wildlife Apart from the Bengal tiger, the reserve includes many wildlife species including Indian leopard, jungle cat, caracal, striped hyena, golden jackal, chital, sambar deer, nilgai, wild boar, small Indian civet, Javan mongoose, ruddy mongoose, honey badger, Rhesus macaque and Northern plains gray langur and Indian hare. Sariska is also ethereal for bird watchers with some of the rarest feathered species like grey partridge, white-throated kingfisher, Indian peafowl, bush quail, sandgrouse, treepie, golden-backed woodpecker, crested serpent eagle and the Indian eagle-owl. In 2003, 16 tigers lived in the reserve. In 2004, it was reported that no tigers were sighted in the reserve, and that no indirect evidence of tiger presence was found such as pug marks, scratch marks on trees, scats. The Rajasthan Forest Department explained that \\"the tigers had temporarily migrated outside the reserve and would be back after monsoon season\\". Project Tiger, now National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), backed this assumption. In January 2005, it was reported that there were no tigers left in Sariska.Have you seen a tiger at Sariska since June? If yes, you’re the only one Indian Express, 23 January 2005. The Rajasthan Forest Department and the Project Tiger Director declared an \\"emergency tiger census\\" in Sariska. The Central Bureau of Investigation, India's intelligence agency, conducted a probe. After a two-month investigation, the agency finally declared that no tigers were left in the reserve. Poaching was blamed for the disappearance of tigers. In July 2008, two tigers from Ranthambhore National Park were relocated to Sariska Tiger Reserve. Another female tiger was relocated in February 2009. In 2012, two tiger cubs and their mother were spotted in the reserve bringing the total number of tigers to seven with five adults. In July 2014, two more cubs were spotted, so that there were 11 tigers in total. As of October 2018, there are 18 tigers including five cubs. By 2020, the tiger population in the reserve has risen to 20. =Relocation efforts= Tiger in the Sariska Tiger Reserve. The collar around its neck is used to track and monitor it. In 2005, the Government of Rajasthan, in cooperation with the Government of India and Wildlife Institute of India, planned the re-introduction of tigers to Sariska and also the relocation of villages. Plans to construct a bypass were also discussed. It was decided to import one male and two females from Ranthambore National Park. The Wildlife Institute of India along with the Government of Rajasthan started tracking the relocated tigers with the help of ISRO's reconnaissance satellites. The first aerial translocation of the male tiger from Ranthambhore to Sariska was carried out on 28 June 2008 by helicopter.* Only two of the four villages' experts were actually moved, though the second, Kankwari, was shifted long after the tigers were re-introduced. However, Kankwari fort has been renovated by the state tourism department, which can possibly violate wildlife protection norms. The first relocated village was Bhagani. Also, the diversion of roads crossing the reserve, an issue critical to the survival of its wildlife, continues to be a problem. One more tigress was shifted to Sariska from Ranthambhore in February 2009. On 28 July 2010, another tigress was brought from Ranthambhore National Park. Totaling five tigers — two males and three females — were living in the reserve until November 2010 when the first relocated tiger died due to poisoning. Unfortunately, the first three of the relocated tigers came from one father. Moreover, the first two tigresses have the same mother.

Plot The movie follows two female American officers (played by Maria Lease and Kathy Williams) who volunteer to enter a Nazi camp undercover to gain information from, and possibly rescue, an inmate. The camp's female inmates serve as prostitutes for German officers and are subjected to humiliating treatment, torture, and rape. When the two female agents learn that their target is being held in solitary detention, one of them arranges to be punished so that she can make contact. This leads to Lt. Harman (Lease) being stripped and strung up by her wrists. The target uses her body to free Harman and they attempt their escape. The escape plan ends in a climactic battle. The movie shows female full frontal nudity for a majority of the film. Reception The movie is seen as a cult classic because it represents the beginning of a fashion for exploitation films about women in prison in the 1970s, such as Women in Cages (1971) and The Big Bird Cage (1972), both of which made Pam Grier a recognizable name in the genre. It is also the first in the Nazi exploitation (or Nazisploitation) genre of concentration camp movies, including Ilsa: She-Wolf of the SS (1974)–which was produced by David F. Friedman and led to several sequels with Dyanne Thorne as the titular character–and the Italian Nazi Love Camp 27 (1977) and Last Orgy of the Third Reich (1977), the latter of which helped launch Daniela Poggi's showbusiness career. It was declined a video certificate by the British Board of Film Classification in 2002 and by the New Zealand Office of Film & Literature Classification. The BBFC upheld their rejection of the film when it was submitted for a certificate for streaming in 2020. It was originally banned in Australia, before passing several times in a modified version with an R18+ rating. It was finally passed uncut in 2005.

This ferry operated across the Gulf of Maine between Portland, Maine, and Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, until the end of the 2004 sailing season. Lion Ferry The Portland-Yarmouth seasonal (summer only) ferry service was established in 1970 by European ferry operator Lion Ferry. The first vessel was the M/S Prince of Fundy which operated from 1970-1976. She was assisted on the route between 1973-1976 by the M/S Bolero. Between 1976-1981 the only vessel in use was the M/S Caribe. Lion Ferry leased the International Marine Terminal from the City of Portland. At the City's request the original lease included a clause for bilateral \\"route protection\\" which prevented Lion from operating a route from any other New England port to Nova Scotia, and prevented the City from allowing another operator to sail to Nova Scotia during Lion's operating season. The City's facilities were used by other operators including cruise ships. Lion also used the Yarmouth Ferry Terminal in Nova Scotia which was owned by the federal Department of Transport, although Lion had to share its Yarmouth facility with Canadian National Railways which operated the MV Bluenose service to Bar Harbor, Maine. From 1978-1982, CN Marine also operated the MV Marine Evangeline (ex-MS Duke of Yorkshire) between Yarmouth and another terminal owned by Canadian National Railways on the Portland waterfront. Prince of Fundy Cruises The service was sold by Lion Ferry in 1982 to Baron Stig Leuhusen who established Prince of Fundy Cruises as a subsidiary of Panamanian-based Transworld Steamship Company. The vessel M/S Scotia Prince (ex-M/S Stena Olympica) was acquired and began service that season. In 1983, the other Yarmouth ferry operator, CN Marine, began using a sistership M/V Bluenose II (ex-M/S Stena Jutlandica) on its Bar Harbor crossing. Prince of Fundy Cruises had the Scotia Prince lengthened in 1987 for increased capacity, changing the visual similarities between both ships. Leuhusen died in 1996 and his estate listed the company for sale in 1999. In August 2000 the company's shares were purchased by a group led by Matthew Hudson of Virginia. The company was renamed Scotia Prince Cruises. The Scotia Prince was re-flagged (Bahamas). The company upgraded the ship and onboard services in addition to other improvements made at the company. The service was repositioned from a transport provider to a transport and package vacation company. The service was marketed as a cruiseferry and destination in its own right. In 1997, CN Marine's successor (government-owned and subsidized) Marine Atlantic Yarmouth- Bar Harbor service was privatized by the government and taken over, along with the M/V Bluenose, by Northumberland Ferries Limited which established a subsidiary service named Bay Ferries Limited. At the same time, the federal Department of Transport transferred operational responsibility of the Yarmouth ferry terminal to Bay Ferries. The Bluenose II was sold at the end of the 1997 season by Bay Ferries and the proceeds were used to purchase the high-speed catamaran ferry HSC INCAT 046, named The Cat. Service began the following summer in 1998 dropping the crossing time from 6 hours to 2.5 hours. A few years later, HSC INCAT 046 was replaced by a slightly larger ship, HSC The Cat, still referred to as The Cat. During the winter of 2002-2003, Scotia Prince Cruises Ltd. inaugurated a service called the \\"Yucatan Express\\", using the M/S Scotia Prince on a route between Tampa, Florida, in the United States and Cancun, Quintana Roo, and Merida, Yucatán, in Mexico. In 2004, the company discovered dangerous levels of mold in the City of Portland's terminal. The CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health evaluated the terminal in March 2005. Based on toxicological and remediation reports and NIOSH's comments on the then current state of the IMT and the likelihood that the building could not be made safe, SPC cancelled its 2005 season. NIOSH's final report reiterates their on-site evaluation stating \\"a health hazard did exist at the IMT building\\" and \\"Additional work has been done at the remaining north (east) building of the IMT since the NIOSH site visit. However, the underlying structural defects of the building have not been addressed, resulting in a high likelihood of continued microbial growth\\". Within hours of SPC notifying the City that it was cancelling the 2005 season for safety reasons, the City of Portland held a press conference announcing they had terminated SPC's lease. The City immediately evicted Scotia Prince Cruises. Scotia Prince moored in Toulon harbour in May 2009 The company will not resume services from Portland. The ship was laid-up in Charleston, South Carolina, in December 2004 and was placed on the market for charter or sale. Following Hurricane Katrina, the Federal Emergency Management Agency chartered the vessel in mid-September 2005 for 6 months as a floating hotel for victims made homeless from that natural disaster. The ship was eventually sold in early 2007. In late September 2005 it was announced that Bay Ferries Limited would begin offering high-speed service from Yarmouth-Portland in 2006 using HSC INCAT 059. Current status Yucatán Express offered on-again, off-again pedestrian and vehicle ferry service on the Canadian ferry ship Scotia Prince. For a short time, it ran in the winter from Tampa, Florida, to Mérida, Mexico, and to Puerto Moreles near Cancún. However, this service was discontinued. In March 2011, the vessel was acquired by Flemingo Liners, a UAE-registered company with roots in India, to revive the ferry route between India and Sri Lanka, which had been suspended in 1983 due to the Sri Lankan civil war. The vessel's first overnight sea crossing was on 11 June 2011, from Tuticorin to Colombo harbour, which will be its standard route, taking 14 hours. The most expensive tickets are generally half-price compared to air tickets between Colombo and the nearest airports in south India, namely Chennai and Bangalore.http://www.flemingoliners.com/ The vessel was earlier idled in a Gibraltar dock between June 2010 and March 2011, after being briefly operated by Marmara Lines company between Ancona and Cesme earlier in 2010. On March 20, 2012, the media reports that the vessel was sold for scrap metal in India. See also *The Boat Mail, the previous vessel serving the Colombo-Tuticorin route.

It was recorded during 1966 and released early in following year on the Verve Folkways imprint of the Verve Records label. The name of the label was later changed to Verve Forecast and the album was re- issued on that label as The First Songs in 1969. This re-issue has a different track order and revised cover design. It peaked at #97 on the Billboard 200, then known as the Pop Albums chart. Starting with this release the song \\"Hands Off the Man\\" was retitled \\"Flim Flam Man (Hands Off the Man)\\". Columbia Records re-issued The First Songs with all-new cover art (featuring a rose illustration) in 1973. In 1999, the album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. In 2008, Rev-Ola released a remastered version of the original album on Compact Disc in the original song order and cover art. Production Nyro signed a contract with Verve Folkways after she gained recognition when Peter Paul and Mary recorded her song \\"And When I Die\\" in 1966. The album was recorded in the fall of 1966 with Herb Bernstein as arranger and Milton Okun producing. There was some uncertainty about Nyro's ability to lead the musicians by playing piano. As a result, pianist Stan Free was hired, and Nyro was encouraged to play the guitar instead, which she rejected. Songs \\"Wedding Bell Blues\\" was released as a single in September 1966 and remained on the \\"Bubbling Under\\" segment of the Billboard Hot 100 (then \\"Pop Singles\\") for 12 weeks, peaking at #103. For the single version of \\"Stoney End,\\" Nyro was forced to rework some of the lyrics that referred to the Bible, because Verve felt it would cause too much controversy. The album included several songs that would become hits for other artists. Blood, Sweat & Tears scored with \\"And When I Die\\" (US #2), The 5th Dimension with \\"Wedding Bell Blues\\" (US #1) and \\"Blowin' Away\\" (US #21), and Barbra Streisand with \\"Stoney End\\" (US #6).

The paper has been soaked with a Potassium nitrate solution. A salt bridge, in electrochemistry, is a laboratory device used to connect the oxidation and reduction half-cells of a galvanic cell (voltaic cell), a type of electrochemical cell. It maintains electrical neutrality within the internal circuit, preventing the cell from rapidly running its reaction to equilibrium. If no salt bridge were present, the solution in one half cell would accumulate negative charge and the solution in the other half cell would accumulate positive charge as the reaction proceeded, quickly preventing further reaction, and hence production of electricity. Salt bridges usually come in two types: glass tube and filter paper.  Glass tube bridges  One type of salt bridge consists of a U-shaped glass tube filled with a relatively inert electrolyte; usually potassium chloride or sodium chloride is used, although the diagram here illustrates the use of a potassium nitrate solution. The electrolyte is so chosen that they are mainly delocalised into their ions. # it does not react with any of the chemicals used in the cell # the anion and cation have similar conductivity, and hence similar migratory speed. The electrolyte is often gelified with agar-agar to help prevent the intermixing of fluids which might otherwise occur. The conductivity of a glass tube bridge depends mostly on the concentration of the electrolyte solution. At concentrations below saturation, an increase in concentration increases conductivity. Beyond-saturation electrolyte content and narrow tube diameter may both lower conductivity.  Filter paper bridges  The other type of salt bridge consists of a filter paper, also soaked with a relatively inert electrolyte, a few common examples of which include potassium nitrate, potassium chloride, and sodium chloride. No gelification agent is required as the filter paper provides a solid medium for conduction. Conductivity of this kind of salt bridge depends on a number of factors: the concentration of the electrolyte solution, the texture of the filter paper and the absorbing ability of the filter paper. Generally, smoother texture and higher absorbency equates to higher conductivity. A porous disk or other porous barriers between the two half-cells may be used instead of a salt bridge; however, they basically serve the same purpose.

It flows from the hills surrounding Calne and meets the River Avon about a mile upstream of Chippenham. The river has a mean flow of . Course The Marden rises just north of the valley of Ranscombe Bottom near Calstone Wellington in Wiltshire. It then flows in a north west direction through Blacklands Park and Quemerford, where it is joined on the right bank by the Rivers Brook. In Calne, the Abberd Brook joins it on the right and the river turns in a westerly direction and is joined by the overspill from Bowood Lake, part of the Bowood House estate on the left at Studleybrook Farm. The river is then joined by the combined Fishers and Cowage brooks before turning to the north- west, past the village of Stanley. later it joins the Bristol Avon to the north east of Chippenham. History The Domesday survey of England in 1086 records four watermills on the Marden at Calne.

Both work by guiding railway carriages and trucks from a dangerous route onto a separate, safer track. Catch points are used to derail vehicles which are out of control on steep slopes (known as runaways). Trap points are used to protect main railway lines from unauthorised vehicles moving onto them from sidings or branch lines. Either of these track arrangements may lead the vehicles into a sand drag or safety siding, track arrangements which are used to safely stop them after they have left the main tracks. A derail is another device used for the same purposes as catch and trap points.  Trap points  Diagram showing the use of trap points to protect the main line at the exit of a siding An insulated track circuit interrupter fitted to trap points Trap points are found at the exit from a siding or where a secondary track joins a main line. A facing turnout is used to prevent any unauthorised movement that may otherwise obstruct the main line. The trap points also prevent any damage that may be done by a vehicle passing over points not set for traffic joining the main line. In the United Kingdom, the use of trap points at siding exits is required by government legislation. An unauthorised movement may be due to a runaway wagon, or may be a train passing a signal at danger. When a signal controlling passage onto a main line is set to \\"danger\\", the trap points are set to derail any vehicle passing that signal. Interlocking is used to make sure that the signal cannot be set to allow passage onto the main line until the trap points have been aligned to ensure this movement can take place. Trap points should preferably be positioned to ensure that any unauthorised vehicle is stopped a safe distance from the main line. However, due to space limitations, it is not always possible to guarantee this. If the lines are track circuited and a wagon or train using the catchpoint could foul an adjacent line, then a track circuit interrupter will be fitted to one of the run-off rails. When a train runs off it will break the track circuit and set main line signals to 'danger'. = Types = There are several different ways of constructing trap points: * A single tongue trap consists of only one switch rail, leading away from the main line to a short tongue of rail. This is usually placed in the rail farthest from the main line. * Double trap points are a full turnout, leading to two tongues. Usually the tongue nearer the main line is longer than the other. * Trap points with a crossing are double trap points where the tongues of rail are longer, so that the trap point rail nearest the main line continues over the siding rail with a common crossing or frog. * A trap road with stops is a short dead-end siding leading to some method of stopping a vehicle, such as a sand drag or buffer stop. * Wide to gauge trap points have switches that work in opposite directions and are therefore either both open or both closed. Vehicles derailed at these points will tend to continue in a forward direction rather than being thrown to one side. Wide to gauge points are typically found on sidings situated between running lines. The type of trap points to be used depends on factors such as the gradient of the siding, and whether locomotives enter the siding. * Independent switches are a kind of wide to gauge switch which are part of two separate crossovers. There are three positions: part of crossover A to left; wide to gauge switches; part of crossover B to right. A good place to view these independent switches are at both ends of Platforms 1 and 2 at Hornsby railway station, Sydney.

They are used to derail (or \\"catch\\") any unauthorised vehicles travelling down the gradient. This may simply be a vehicle that has accidentally been allowed to run away down the slope, or could be a wagon that has decoupled from its train. In either case, the runaway vehicle could collide with a train farther down the slope, causing a serious accident. Catch points may consist of a full turnout or a single switch blade. In some cases, on a track that is only traversed by uphill traffic, trailing point blades are held in a position to derail any vehicle travelling downhill. However, any traffic travelling in the correct (uphill) direction can pass over the turnout safely, pushing the switch blades into the appropriate position. Once the wheels have passed, the catch points are forced back into the derailing position by springs. In these cases, a lever may be provided to temporarily override the catch points and allow safe passage down the gradient in certain controlled circumstances. The use of catch points became widespread in the United Kingdom after the Abergele rail disaster (1868), where runaway wagons containing paraffin oil (kerosene) collided with an express train. Catch points continued to be used in the UK until the mid-20th century. At this time, continuous automatic brakes, which automatically stop any vehicles separated from their train, were widely adopted, making catch points largely obsolete.  Wide to gauge catch points  Sometimes a track is located between two other tracks that are converging, and there is nowhere for a catchpoint to divert a train to. In such cases, a pair of single catchpoints of left and right hand may be provided to derail the overrunning train without directing it to either side. The two blades of an ordinary turnout may also be operated separately for the same purpose. Examples would be the north and south ends of platforms 1 and 2 at Hornsby in New South Wales.  Sand drag  In some cases, catch points and trap points direct vehicles into a sand drag or safety siding, also sometimes called an arrestor bed. This may be a siding simply leading to a mound of sand, gravel or other granular material, or a siding where the rails are within sand-filled troughs. This method of stopping a vehicle travelling at speed is preferred over a buffer stop as there is less shock to the vehicle involved.  Chock block  A cheap and simple alternative to catch points or a derail is a chock block, which is a piece of timber that can be positioned and locked over one of the rails at the end of a siding to protect the main line from runaways. In order for the siding to be used the chock block must be removed.  Effectiveness  North Castle Cary railway station in England; these trap points would run the derailed train into a footbridge. A British Rail Class 165 that was derailed by a set of trap points at London Paddington station, June 2016. The train suffered severe damage to the rear driving unit and also damaged a stanchion after the derailed train collided with it. Because catch points are rarely needed, it is not always clear whether they will in fact derail a runaway train effectively and as safely as possible. For example, use of Castle Cary catch points would result in the train being directed into a footbridge. Use of catch points to derail a train that had passed a signal at danger at London Paddington station in June 2016 resulted in the empty train, a Class 165, hitting and severely damaging an overhead line electrification stanchion, causing all services to and from the station to be halted for hours.  Accidents  In 2010, in snowy conditions, at Carrbridge, a Class 66 passed a red signal as well as catch points, leading to the train going down the embankment, injuring the two crew on board.

Its main theme is women in prison. Unlike most of Franco's work, the film remains banned in the United Kingdom due to large amounts of sexual violence and because one of the lead actresses in many of the sex scenes, Susan Hemingway, was 16 at the time the film was made. The film was rejected by the British Board of Film Classification when submitted in 2004 and has since not been successfully appealed.BBFC website - WOMEN IN CELLBLOCK 9, Rejected 24 February,2004. Plot The film is set in a South American jungle prison during a revolution. Initially, the camp commander and the prison physician, Dr. Costa, wait for a few guards on a truck. On board are six young women. Three of them were arrested on suspicion of revolutionary activities, the other three are made available to the guards to be raped. The three detainees, Karine, Barbara, and Aida, are found shortly thereafter, naked and chained in a standing position, in the notorious Cellblock 9. Gradually, they are presented to the \\"interrogation\\", which is supported by the doctor through various tortures. Barbara and Aida resist the torture and remain silent, Karine, however, breaks down under the torture, and some revolutionaries denounced the (unnamed) city. In the meantime, the young indigenous student Marie also ends up in the cellblock. Allegedly, propaganda material was found on her by the insurgents. Their torture was to spend three days without food and water in a single cell. She was then taken to dinner with the commander of the doctor, where they have oral sex in order to then get a little sip of salty Champagne. After the four women in Cellblock 9 again are forging among themselves, they devise a plan to contact their contacts in the capital. The quartet manages to distract the guard in order to knock him out and flee with his rifle. Shortly after leaving the cellblock, Aida is killed in a gunfight with another guard who is also killed. The other three flee into the jungle, where Barbara has been shot and they progress slowly. They make it to an old temple, where they feel safe and remove the bullet from Barbara's shoulder. Karine and Marie go into the jungle to look for food, but the guards find their trail and meet them at the temple. As Barbara is killed, the other two, alerted by her screams, run back to the temple and are suddenly confronted by the camp commander and the doctor (surrounded by prison guards). In a last desperate action Karine attempts to steal the commander's pistol. When she fails to pull the trigger, the commander gives the order to fire and the last two prisoners are struck down on the spot. With the desecration of the corpses, the film ends.

He attended Westminster High School in Westminster, California. Early life Klesko was born June 12, 1971, in Westminster, California. His father was an oilfields worker whom Klesko lost at a young age. His mother, Lorene, worked at an aerospace parts company in Santa Ana and helped Klesko learn to play baseball. When he was nine, she dug a pitcher's mound for him in his backyard. She enrolled him in pitching school with Ron Lefebvre and put on catcher's gear herself to catch Klesko three times a week. Klesko attended Westminster High School, where even though he hit a lot of home runs, he starred as a pitcher, throwing a ninety-two mile per hour fastball and pitching for the USA Junior Olympic team. He strained a ligament pitching for the junior team at 17, though, and concentrated on hitting thereafter. Klesko signed a letter of intent to play college baseball at Arizona State, but he never did so, instead signing with the Atlanta Braves after the team selected him in the fifth round of the 1989 Major League Baseball (MLB) Draft. Professional career Klesko hit a home run in three consecutive World Series games against the Cleveland Indians in Games 3, 4, and 5 of the 1995 World Series. In Game 3, he hit a solo shot off of Charles Nagy in the seventh inning of a 7-6 loss. The Game 4 home run, another solo shot (this time off Ken Hill) put the Braves up 1-0 in the sixth; they would win the game 5-2. In Game 5, his ninth-inning two-run home run to right field off José Mesa was almost caught by his mother; Klesko wound up trading the man who caught it an autographed Greg Maddux baseball for it. The Braves lost that game 5-4, but they beat the Indians for the fourth time in the sixth game to become World Series champions. Klesko hit at least 21 home runs in eight of his 13 major league seasons, with a high of 34 homers in . His most productive season came in , when he hit .286 with 30 home runs and posted career highs in RBI (113), runs (105), stolen bases (23) and slugging percentage (.539), and made the National League All-Star team. In , Klesko hit .300 with 29 HR and 95 RBI, and collected career-highs in hits (162) and doubles (39). Defensively he shuttled around the outfield and first base. In his career, Klesko compiled a .370 on-base percentage with a .500 slugging average, for an .870 OPS. His .525 slugging percentage as a Brave ranks fourth all-time among the team's career leaders, ahead of Eddie Mathews. His .886 OPS as a Brave ranks him fifth among Braves' all-time leaders. Klesko missed nearly the entire season due to major shoulder surgery. He returned on September 21, drawing a walk as a pinch-hitter in his first plate appearance. On December 19, 2006, Klesko signed a one-year contract with the San Francisco Giants. Klesko announced his retirement from baseball on April 18, . Off the field *As of 2019, Klesko serves as a pre-game and post-game analyst for the Atlanta Braves on Fox Sports South and SportsSouth. *Klesko has been actively involved with the Padres Community Relations efforts.

Born in Romania in a Jewish family, Doru Davidovici became one of the most loved Romanian fiction writers in the 1980s. During the communist years, his books gave an unusual sense of liberty and new horizons by describing the experience of flying, and the closeness it forged - both between pilots, and between pilots and their machines. The plane is seen by Davidovici not simply as a machine that enables one to fly but as an actual character, with its own personality and almost with its own soul. His work is influenced by writers like Ray Bradbury, Radu Tudoran and Bertolt Brecht. The titles include The Horses of Voroneţ (1974), The Colour of the Sky (1981), Silver Wings (1983) and Rise and Walk (1989). Keeping a sense of proportion, it is reasonable to draw a parallel between Davidovici and the French aviator and writer Antoine de Saint Exupéry. They both found a source of literary inspiration in their profession, and they both died, at about the same age, flying a fighter plane. Beside his narrative work, Doru Davidovici is known for his essay on the UFOs, My colleagues from the unknown. Here Davidovici regards, once again through his pilot eyes, the UFOs and the issues raised by their presumed existence. Doru Davidovici lost his life together with Dumitru Petra on 20 April 1989 during landing procedures while flying his MiG-21 from a training flight back home to RoAF 86th Air Base.

Tennyson Point is located 10 kilometres west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Ryde and is part of the Northern Sydney region. Tennyson Point sits on the northern bank of the Parramatta River on a peninsula positioned between Morrisons Bay and Glades Bay. The suburb was originally called Tennyson before it was renamed Tennyson Point by the Geographical Names Board of New South Wales in 2001.  History  Tennyson Point takes its name from the Tennyson Estate, named after the poet Alfred Tennyson, which was subdivided in 1887. Captain William Raven,ADB on Raven (1756-1814) who sailed to New South Wales in 1792 as captain and part owner of the Britannia, was granted 100 acres (40 ha) of land in the area in 1795, plus another 285 acres (115 ha) in 1799. The grant to Raven was known as Grove Farm. These Eastern Farm properties were managed for him by the brewer James SquireADB on Squire of Kissing Point until 1822. The tip of the peninsula into the Parramatta River at Tennyson Point is now called Raven Point. The creek running into Morrisons Bay near the western boundary of Tennyson Point is now called Grove Creek. In the 1820s all the land of the current suburb was owned by James Squire's daughter Mary Ann Farnell and her husband Thomas Charles Farnell (brewer). Mary Ann and Thomas were the parents of James Squire Farnell who became the first Australian born premier of New South Wales.  Population  In the 2016 Census, there were 1,219 people in Tennyson Point. 66.9% of people were born in Australia and 68.8% of people spoke only English at home.

Diehr, 450 U.S. 175 (1981), was a United States Supreme Court decision which held that controlling the execution of a physical process, by running a computer program did not preclude patentability of the invention as a whole.. The high court reiterated its earlier holdings that mathematical formulas in the abstract could not be patented, but it held that the mere presence of a software element did not make an otherwise patent-eligible machine or process patent ineligible. Diehr was the third member of a trilogy of Supreme Court decisions on the patent-eligibility of computer software related inventions.The other two cases were , and . The Supreme Court's most recent decisions on patent eligibility of software-related inventions are and , both of which are cases concerning business methods.  Background =The problem and its solution= The inventors, respondents, filed a patent application for a \\"[process] for molding raw, uncured synthetic rubber into cured precision products.\\" The process of curing synthetic rubber depends on a number of factors including time, temperature and thickness of the mold. Using the Arrhenius equation > k = A e^{{-E_a}/{RT}} > which may be restated as ln(v) = CZ + x it is possible to calculate when to open the press and to remove the cured, molded rubber. The problem was that there was, at the time the invention was made, no disclosed way to obtain an accurate measure of the temperature without opening the press. In the traditional method the temperature of the mold press, which was apparently set at a fixed temperature and was controlled by thermostat, fluctuated due to the opening and closing of the press. The invention solved this problem by using embedded thermocouples to constantly check the temperature, and then feeding the measured values into a computer. The computer then used the Arrhenius equation to calculate when sufficient energy had been absorbed so that the molding machine should open the press. =The claims= Independent claim 1 of the allowed patent is representative. It provides: 1\\\\. A method of operating a rubber-molding press for precision molded compounds with the aid of a digital computer, comprising: *providing said computer with a data base for said press including at least, natural logarithm conversion data (ln), the activation energy constant (C) unique to each batch of said compound being molded, and a constant (x) dependent upon the geometry of the particular mold of the press, *initiating an interval timer in said computer upon the closure of the press for monitoring the elapsed time of said closure, *constantly determining the temperature (Z) of the mold at a location closely adjacent to the mold cavity in the press during molding, *constantly providing the computer with the temperature (Z), *repetitively calculating in the computer, at frequent intervals during each cure, the Arrhenius equation for reaction time during the cure, which is :::ln(v)=CZ+x :::where v is the total required cure time, *repetitively comparing in the computer at said frequent intervals during the cure each said calculation of the total required cure time calculated with the Arrhenius equation and said elapsed time, and *opening the press automatically when a said comparison indicates equivalence.Diehr, 450 U.S. at 177, n. 1. =Proceedings before Office and CCPA= The patent examiner rejected this invention as unpatentable subject matter under 35 U.S.C. 101.. He argued that the steps performed by the computer were unpatentable as a computer program under Gottschalk v. Benson. The Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences of the USPTO affirmed the rejection. The Court of Customs and Patent Appeals (CCPA), the predecessor to the current Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, reversed, noting that an otherwise patentable invention did not become unpatentable simply because a computer was involved. The U.S. Supreme Court granted the petition for certiorari by the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks to resolve this question.  The Supreme Court's opinion  The Court repeated its earlier holding that mathematical formulas in the abstract are not eligible for patent protection. But it also held that a physical machine or process which makes use of a mathematical algorithm is different from an invention which claims the algorithm, as such, in the abstract. Thus, if the invention as a whole meets the requirements of patentability--that is, it involves \\"transforming or reducing an article to a different state or thing\\"--it is patent-eligible, even if it includes a software component. The CCPA's reversal of the patent rejection was affirmed. But the Court carefully avoided overruling Benson or Flook. It did criticize the analytic methodology of Flook, however, by challenging its use of analytic dissection, which the Flook Court based on Neilson v. Harford. The Diehr Court cited the Senate Report and the CCPA Decision in In re Bergy, 596 F.2d 952, 961 (CCPA 1979) to hold that (a) claims must be considered \\"as a whole,\\" just as they are for all other patentability determinations, without extracting a \\"gist\\" or \\"point of novelty\\" to be considered in isolation, and (b) section 101 governs the kind of subject matter that can be patented, while concerns for novelty and non- obviousness are considered separately under sections 102 and 103:Diehr, 450 U.S. at 188-189.Section 103, which concerns obviousness, states that the obviousness or non-obviousness of what is claimed to be an invention must be determined by considering whether \\"the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made.\\" (Emphasis supplied.) No comparable language is found in section 101, which has retained substantially the same form since the first patent act in 1790. :In determining the eligibility of respondents' claimed process for patent protection under § 101, their claims must be considered as a whole. It is inappropriate to dissect the claims into old and new elements and then to ignore the presence of the old elements in the analysis. This is particularly true in a process claim, because a new combination of steps in a process may be patentable even though all the constituents of the combination were well known and in common use before the combination was made. The \\"novelty\\" of any element or steps in a process, or even of the process itself, is of no relevance in determining whether the subject matter of a claim falls within the § 101 categories of possibly patentable subject matter. :It has been urged that novelty is an appropriate consideration under § 101. Presumably, this argument results from the language in § 101 referring to any “new and useful” process, machine, etc. Section 101, however, is a general statement of the type of subject matter that is eligible for patent protection “subject to the conditions and requirements of this title.” Specific conditions for patentability follow and § 102 covers in detail the conditions relating to novelty. The question therefore of whether a particular invention is novel is “wholly apart from whether the invention falls into a category of statutory subject matter.” The patent no 3591.978 The patent that issued after the decision was U.S. Patent 4,344,142, \\"Direct digital control of rubber molding presses.\\". The patent includes 11 method claims, three of which are independent. All method claims relate to molding of physical articles. The only diagrams in the patent are flowcharts. There are no diagrams of machinery. As the dissenting opinion in Diehr noted, the patent specification \\"teaches nothing about the chemistry of the synthetic rubber-curing process, nothing about the raw materials to be used in curing synthetic rubber, nothing about the equipment to be used in the process, and nothing about the significance or effect of any process variable such as temperature, curing time, particular compositions of material, or mold configurations.\\"Diehr, 450 U.S. at 206. Subsequent developments For many years, it was believed that Diehr effectively overruled Flook, despite the majority opinion's avoiding any such statement.See Diehr, 450 U.S. at 209-215 (Stevens, J., dissenting, contending that the fact patterns in both cases are indistinguishable). In 2012, in Mayo v. Prometheus,. the unanimous opinion of the Supreme Court interpreted Diehr so as to harmonize it with Flook. The Court \\"found the overall process patent eligible because of the way the additional steps of the process [besides the equation] integrated the equation into the process as a whole.\\"Mayo, 132 S. Ct. at 1298. The Court \\"nowhere suggested that all these steps, or at least the combination of those steps, were in context obvious, already in use, or purely conventional.\\"Mayo, 132 S. Ct. at 1299. \\"These other steps apparently added to the formula something that in terms of patent law’s objectives had significance—they transformed the process into an inventive application of the formula.\\" The Court interpreted Diehr slightly differently in Alice v. CLS Bank, another unanimous opinion, but without taking issue with the Mayo interpretation. The Alice Court said: > In Diehr, by contrast [with Flook], we held that a computer-implemented > process for curing rubber was patent eligible, but not because it involved a > computer. The claim employed a \\"well-known\\" mathematical equation, but it > used that equation in a process designed to solve a technological problem in > \\"conventional industry practice.\\" The invention in Diehr used a > \\"thermocouple\\" to record constant temperature measurements inside the rubber > mold — something \\"the industry ha[d] not been able to obtain.\\" The > temperature measurements were then fed into a computer, which repeatedly > recalculated the remaining cure time by using the mathematical equation. > These additional steps, we recently explained, \\"transformed the process into > an inventive application of the formula.\\" Mayo, supra, at ___, 132 S.Ct., at > 1299. In other words, the claims in Diehr were patent eligible because they > improved an existing technological process, not because they were > implemented on a computer.134 S. Ct. at 2358 (citations omitted). These two opinions state the current Supreme Court interpretation of what the Diehr case holds. See also * Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U.S. 63 (1972). * Parker v.

It was created in 1964 as the House of Assembly of Papua and New Guinea but gained its current name after the nation was granted independence in 1975. The 111 members of parliament serve five- year terms, 89 of whom are chosen from single-member \\"open\\" electorates, which are sometimes referred to as \\"seats\\" but are officially known as constituencies. The remaining 22 are chosen from single-member provincial electorates: the 20 provinces, the autonomous province of Bougainville (North Solomons), and the National Capital District. Each provincial member becomes governor of their province unless they take a ministerial position, in which case the governorship passes to an open member of the province. From 1964 until 1977 an Optional Preferential Voting System was used. The first past the post system was used from 1977 until 2002. Electoral reforms introduced by former Prime Minister Mekere Morauta introduced Limited Preferential Voting, in which voters numbered three preferred candidates. LPV was first used nationally in the 2007 election. As in other Commonwealth realms, the party or coalition with the most seats in the parliament is invited by the Governor- General to form a government, and its leader subsequently becomes Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea. The Prime Minister then appoints his cabinet from fellow parliament members. Members of parliament are seated in a similar manner to other Westminster system parliaments, but use chairs instead of benches. Papua New Guinea has a fractious political culture, and no party in the history of parliament has yet won a majority. Therefore, negotiations between parties have always been necessary to form governments. New governments are protected from votes of no confidence during their first 18 months and during the last 12 months before a national election. More recently, in a move aimed at further minimizing no-confidence motions, then- Prime Minister Mekere Morauta introduced changes that prevented members of the government from voting in favour of such a motion. All citizens over the age of 18 may vote, although voting is not compulsory.

Both names translate literally to \\"Japanese stringed instrument.\\" According to Shintō myth as written in the Kojiki, the yamatogoto played an important role in the origins of Japan itself. In the myth, Amaterasu, goddess of the sun, is insulted by her brother Susano-o no Mikoto and hides in a cave, refusing to emerge. The world is therefore plunged into darkness. Amaterasu is eventually coaxed out of her cave by the goddess Ame no Uzume, who performs a dance outside the cave, to music provided by the twanging of six hunting bows. Amused by the music, and by the entertained sounds of the other gods, Amaterasu leaves the cave and returns to the firmament. The six bows are lashed together to form an instrument, and the first wagon or yamatogoto is born. The instrument's form has changed very little since the eighth century. Similar in shape to the more commonly known koto, the yamatogoto is narrower, as it has fewer strings. Bridges are made from the natural forks of tree branches, particularly maple trees, according to tradition. Unlike many instruments, the yamatogoto's strings are not arranged in a scale, from low to high pitch, but in a preset melodic sequence which is played in rhythmic patterns. Another common playing technique involves a quick glissando across all the strings, with all but the last string played immediately muted with the hand, thus allowing only the last string to resonate. Today, the instrument is used only in the Shintō ceremonial/court music called gagaku, and even then it is not common. Nevertheless, its central role in Japanese mythology allows it to retain some reverence.

The Complete Film Dictionary Meridian / NAL Books p.372. The Techniscope format uses a two film-perforation negative pulldown per frame, instead of the standard four-perforation frame usually exposed in 35 mm film photography. Techniscope's 2.33:1 aspect ratio is easily cropped to the 2.39:1 widescreen ratio,NOTE: In 1970, the SMPTE revised the 2.35:1 aspect ratio to 2.39:1 (now known as 2.40:1), however, before standardization, most Techniscope films were photographed and released in the 2.35:1 aspect ratio because it uses half the amount of 35 mm film stock and standard spherical lenses. Thus, Techniscope release prints are made by anamorphosizing and enlarging each frame by a factor of two. Techniscope-photographed films During its primary reign of 1960–1980, more than 350 films were photographed in Techniscope, the first of which was The Pharaoh's Woman, released 10 December 1960.—retrieved 2007-03-19 Given its considerable savings in production cost but lesser image quality, Techniscope was primarily an alternative format used by low-budget film makers, mainly in the horror and western genres. Since the format originated in Italy, most Techniscope format films were European productions. In the U.S., Techniscope was used in the low- budget A.C. Lyles Westerns for Paramount Pictures, as well as in a few Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer pictures as well, and Universal Studios briefly used it extensively in the mid to late 1960s.http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/widescreen/wingts2.htm Producer Sid Pink recalled that unlike Europe, the American film studios were charged by the Technicolor company for using Techniscope in their film prints.p.194 Pink, Sidney So You Want to Make Movies: My Life as an Independent Film Producer Pineapple Press, 1989 George Lucas shot his first two features, THX 1138 and American Graffiti, in Techniscope in order to give them a gritty, documentary- like feel.Jones, Brian Jay George Lucas: A Life Little/Brown, 2016 Regarding the diminished image quality, film reviewer Roger Ebert wrote about the film Counterpoint (1968): \\"The movie is shot in Techniscope, a process designed to give a wide-screen picture while saving film and avoiding payment of royalties to the patented processes like Panavision. In this film, as in 'Harry Frigg', Techniscope causes washed-out color and a loss of detail. Universal shouldn't be so cheap.\\"Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times review for Counterpoint Recent films shot with 2-perf 35 mm \\"Techniscope\\" include I'm Yours (2012), Silver Linings Playbook (2012), Argo (2012), and Too Late (2015). Techniscope's commercial revival Techniscope employs standard 35 mm camera films, which are suitable for 2-perf (Techniscope), 3-perf, conventional 4-perf (spherical or CinemaScope), and even 6-perf (Cinerama) and 8-perf (VistaVision), as all of those processes listed employ the same camera and intermediate films, and positive print films intended for direct projection (although 2-, 3- and 8-perfs are not distribution formats). In 1999, in Australia, MovieLab film laboratory owner Kelvin Crumplin revived the Techniscope format renamed as MultiVision 235, attempting to commercialise it as a cinematography format alternative to the Super 16 mm format. His proposition was that it yielded a 35 mm-quality image (from which could be derived natural 2.35:1 and 1.85:1 aspect ratio images) for the same cost as Super 16 mm cinematography. Mr Crumplin established MovieLab to provide telecine and film processing and printing services, and, with engineer Bruce McNaughton of The Aranda Group, Victoria, Australia, engineered and produced Arriflex BL1 and Arriflex IIC 35 mm cameras for the Techniscope 2-perf format.Holben, Jay & Bankston, Douglas (February 2000). \\"Inventive New Options for Film\\" American Cinematographer Magazine Vol. 81, No. 2, pp.96–107. Aaton, Panavision, and Arriflex have modern 2-perf cameras. Aranda in Australia is also currently converting cameras like Arriflex 2A/B/C Arri 3, Arri BL, Mitchell, Eclair, Moviecam. The Russian cameras, Kinor and Konvas are also converted. Factory-made kits for certain Mitchell and Mitchell-derived cameras are occasionally available on auction sites. In the specific case of a Mitchell, the kit includes a replacement aperture plate and cam for the film movement, a replacement gear for the camera body, and, for a reflex camera, a replacement focusing screen. As all Mitchell cameras incorporate the provision for a \\"hard mask\\" within the movement itself, it is often possible to keep the 4-perf aperture plate, and insert a 2-perf mask in the mask slot, as an economy measure. In 2011, Lomography released a movie camera, the Lomokino, capable of making short movies on standard 35 mm still photography film which uses a frame format similar to Techniscope, with two perforations for each exposure, though with no space or capabilities for the sound track, taking 144 frames on a 36 exposures roll. The camera is erroneously labeled as being \\"Super 35\\", Super 35 having three perforations per frame. Movies made with the Lomokino may not show properly without modifications on Techniscope projectors, the Lomokino is hand cranked and the frame rate is controlled manually, usually being around 2-6 FPS. Techniscope vs. anamorphic: advantages and disadvantages Techniscope's advantages over anamorphic CinemaScope are: * More economical: half the film stock used in 4-perforation frame cinematography; half the stock, same running time, less negative to develop. * Cinematography requires simpler, but technically superior, spherical lenses. * Film stock loads last twice as long; 2-perf stock shoots at 45 feet per minute (@24fps), while 4-perf stock shoots at 90 feet per minute. * (may be seen aesthetically as either an advantage or disadvantage:) The circle of confusion of Techniscope is circular (due to its spherical lenses), whereas that of CinemaScope is elliptical (due to its anamorphic lenses). Techniscope's disadvantages against CinemaScope: * Two-perf 35 mm is a production-only format, that must be converted to other formats for distribution. For distribution prints for theatrical venues, the frame is enlarged from a 2-perf flat ratio to a 4-perf anamorphic ratio. Enlarging the image to the 35 mm print subsequently enlarges the negative's film grain. (Although some cineastes sought this visual feel for the story; e.g. westerns photographed to appear unpolished, thereby enhancing the period settings' verisimilitude.) This step is also an additional production expense. If the enlargement process is done optically, the generation loss will add even more grain and reduce the image sharpness. Alternatively, the enlargement can be done as part of the Digital Intermediate (DI) process. This involves digitally scanning the 2-perf film negative. Output to film is done with a film recorder, such as the Arrilaser. * Two- perforation cameras and telecine installations are rare. (Note: As of early 2008 Aaton is coming out with their newly designed 2-perf-native (3-perf user- switchable) Aaton Penelope camera. Konvas cameras have been available in 2-perf for a while, and Arri is making 2-perf gates for their Arricams soon, available only through the rental dealers though. And more and more telecine suites have 2-perf gates for their film scanners.) * The narrower frame line (between frames) emphasises imperfections (e.g. hairs in the gate, lens flares). Note: When transferring a Techniscope film to a digital video format, the 2-perf negative or 2-perf interpositive A/B rolls can be used (the original film negative from the camera, or the first-generation film elements prepared for the making of the anamorphic 4-frame 35 mm release print negative), thus bypassing any blown-up 4-perf element. Many DVD editions have been transferred this way and the results have frequently been stunning, e.g. Blue Underground's The Bird with the Crystal Plumage and MGM's special editions of Sergio Leone 's Westerns.

The Baháʼí teachings state, however, that the international auxiliary language should not suppress existing natural languages, and that the concept of unity in diversity must be applied to preserve cultural distinctions. The Baha'i principle of an International Auxiliary Language (IAL) represents a paradigm for establishing peaceful and reciprocal relations between the world's primary speech communities – while shielding them from undue linguistic pressures from the dominant speech community/communities.Gregory P.

The Baháʼí teachings see improved communication between peoples throughout the world as a vital part of world unity and peace. The Baháʼí teachings see the current multiplicity of languages as a major impediment to unity, since the existence of so many languages cuts the free flow of information and makes it difficult for the average individual to obtain a universal perspective on world events. The principle of the selection and institutionalization of a Universal/International Auxiliary Language is among the Baháʼí Faith's key tenets. Baháʼuʼlláh, the founder of the Baháʼí Faith, writing in the Tablets of Ishráqát and Maqṣúd, taught that the lack of a common language is a major barrier to world unity since the lack of communication between peoples of different languages undermines efforts toward world peace due to misunderstandings of language; he urged that humanity should choose an auxiliary language that would be taught in schools in addition to one's own native language, so that people could understand one another. He stated that until an auxiliary language is adopted, complete unity between the various parts of the world would continue to be unrealized. ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, the son of the founder of the religion, called the promotion of the principle of the international auxiliary language \\"the very first service to the world of man\\" and its realization as \\"the greatest achievement of the age in conferring profit and pleasure on mankind.\\" Baháʼuʼlláh stressed, however, that the auxiliary language should not suppress existing natural languages, and that the concept of unity in diversity must be applied to languages. The Baháʼí teachings state that cultural heterogeneity is compatible with unity, and that the Baháʼí teaching of unity requires the embracing of cultural diversity since humanity is enriched by the various cultures throughout the world. The Baháʼí teachings state that having an international auxiliary language would remove the pressure from the natural aggrandizement of majority language groups and thus preserve minority languages, since each person would keep their own mother-tongue, and thus minority cultures. Choice of language Neither Baháʼí literature, nor any of the various Baháʼí authorities, have specified which language should be used as global auxiliary. The Baháʼí writings state that any natural or constructed language may be selected. The predominant language of the time is not necessarily to be used as the auxiliary language by default. The Baháʼí writings stipulate that the auxiliary language is to be selected or invented by the world's parliaments and rulers, thus placing the choice of language in the hands of language planners. Baháʼuʼlláh states that a \\"world language will either be invented or chosen from among existing languages\\" and: Various Baháʼí leaders have made various comments to certain languages and qualities. ʻAbdu'l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi made occasional comments favorable to the notion that potential auxiliary languages be simple and easy to learn. ʻAbdu'l-Bahá also praised the ideal of Esperanto, a constructed language, and there was an affinity between Esperantists and Baháʼís during the late 19th century and early 20th century. While ʻAbdu'l-Bahá encouraged people to learn Esperanto, he never stated that it should become the auxiliary language. On February 12, 1913, ʻAbdu'l-Bahá gave a talk to the Paris Esperanto Society, > Now, praise be to God that Dr. Zamenhof has invented the Esperanto language. > It has all the potential qualities of becoming the international means of > communication. All of us must be grateful and thankful to him for this noble > effort; for in this way he has served his fellowmen well.

If one studies fifty languages > one may yet travel through a country and not know the language. Therefore I > hope that you will make the utmost effort, so that this language of > Esperanto may be widely spread. Also both Shoghi Effendi and the Universal House of Justice, the governing body of the Baháʼís, emphasized that there is no official Baháʼí endorsement of Esperanto as the international auxiliary language. Today there exists an active sub-community of Baháʼí Esperantists; the Baháʼí Esperanto-League was founded in 1973, and Lidia Zamenhof, daughter of Esperanto creator L. L. Zamenhof, was a Baháʼí. Ehsan Yarshater, the founding editor of Encyclopædia Iranica, notes how as a child in Iran he learned Esperanto and that when his mother was visiting Haifa on a Baháʼí pilgrimage he wrote her a letter in Persian as well as Esperanto. At the request of ʻAbdu'l-Baha, Agnes Baldwin Alexander became an early advocate of Esperanto and used it to spread the Baháʼí teachings at meetings and conferences in Japan. James Ferdinand Morton, Jr., an early member of the Baháʼí Faith in Greater Boston, was vice-president of the Esperanto League for North America. The selection of the existing language or the creation of a new one each have their advantages; the selection of an existing language allows for a certain portion of the world's population to have already learnt it, but using an invented language would presumably have the advantage of being emotionally neutral. Mother tongue and unity in diversity The Baháʼí teachings on an auxiliary international language does not in itself threaten living languages or cultures; they do not call for cultural uniformity. Instead, the Baháʼí teachings value and promote cultural diversity by stating that there should be unity in diversity. The term \\"auxiliary\\" in Baháʼí scripture means that the international language will be taught in addition to first languages and that it will be secondary to those. Since the auxiliary language is meant for community-external, inter- community communication, it is functionally separate from one's primary language. While secondary to the primary language of one's culture, it establishes reliable communication between members of differing primary speech communities. The Baháʼí teachings see minority group members as full members of the broader society, and thus see the need for unique cultural rights. Language is strongly attached to culture. In Baháʼí literature, one's mother tongue is described as \\"the most profound characteristic of a people\\", \\"the garment of the spirit of the people\\", the \\"native air which we need for living and dying, which surrounds us from cradle to grave, which is and remains our most personal property.\\" Whereas both cultural and linguistic change are normal and ever-greater world unity expected, the precipitous extinction of non-dominant languages and cultures is therefore undesirable. Since the Baháʼí teachings on oneness of humankind emphasize the value of both diversity and unity in the sense of harmony rather than simple sameness, minority cultural rights can be seen as a matter of cultural justice, and language rights a subset of those cultural rights.

It is operated by United States Coast Guard but is funded by the 13 nations interested in trans-Atlantic navigation. As of 2011 the governments contributing to the International Ice Patrol include Belgium, Canada (see Canadian Ice Service), Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Panama, Poland, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The organization was established in 1914 in response to the sinking of RMS Titanic. The primary mission of the Ice Patrol is to monitor the iceberg danger in the North Atlantic Ocean and provide relevant iceberg warning products to the maritime community. History= Founding = From the earliest journeys into the North Atlantic, icebergs have threatened vessels. A review of the history of navigation prior to the turn of the 20th century shows an impressive number of casualties occurred in the vicinity of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. For example, sank in 1833 with a loss of 215 people. Between 1882 and 1890, 14 vessels were lost and 40 seriously damaged due to ice. This does not include the large number of whaling and fishing vessels lost or damaged by ice. It took one of the greatest marine disasters of all time to arouse public demand for international cooperative action to deal with this marine hazard. This disaster, the sinking of on 15 April 1912, was the prime impetus for the establishment of the International Ice Patrol. On her maiden voyage from Southampton, England bound for New York, Titanic collided with an iceberg just south of the tail of the Grand Banks and sank in less than three hours. The loss of life was enormous with more than 1,500 of the 2,224 passengers and crew perishing. Titanic, the brand new ship of the White Star Line, was the largest passenger liner of her time displacing 45,000 tons and capable of sustained speed in excess of . The loss of Titanic gripped the world with a sobering awareness of an iceberg's potential for tragedy. The sheer dimensions of the Titanic disaster created sufficient public reaction on both sides of the Atlantic to prod reluctant governments into action, producing the first Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) convention in 1914. After the Titanic disaster, the U.S. Navy assigned the cruisers and to patrol the Grand Banks of Newfoundland for the remainder of 1912. In 1913, the United States Navy could not spare ships for this purpose, so the Revenue Cutter Service (forerunner of the United States Coast Guard) assumed responsibility, assigning USRC Seneca and USRC Miami to conduct the patrol. At the first International Conference on the Safety of Life at Sea, which was convened in London on 12 November 1913, the subject of patrolling the ice regions was thoroughly discussed. The convention signed on 30 January 1914, by the representatives of the world's various maritime powers, provided for the inauguration of an international derelict-destruction, ice observation, and ice patrol service, consisting of vessels, which should patrol the ice regions during the season of iceberg danger and attempt to keep the trans-Atlantic lanes clear of derelicts during the remainder of the year. Due primarily to the experience gained in 1912 and 1913, the United States Government was invited to undertake the management of the triple service, the expense to be defrayed by the 13 nations interested in trans-Atlantic navigation. The second International Conference on Safety of Life at Sea was convened in London on 16 April 1929. Eighteen nations participated, all of which signed the final act on 31 May 1929. Because of the fear in the United States Senate as a result of ambiguities in Article 54 dealing with control, the 1929 convention was not ratified by the United States until 7 August 1936, and even then the ratification was accompanied by three reservations. At the same time, Congress enacted legislation on 25 June 1936, formally requiring the Commandant of the Coast Guard to administer the International Ice Observation and Ice Patrol Service (Chap. 807, para. 2 49 USC 1922) and describing in general fashion the manner in which this service was to be performed. With only minor changes, this remains today as the basic Coast Guard authority to operate the International Ice Patrol. Since 1929, there have been three SOLAS conventions (1948, 1960 & 1974). None of these have recommended any basic change affecting the Ice Patrol. Every year since 1914, the United States Coast Guard and the International Ice Patrol lay a wreath from a ship or an aircraft at the site of the Titanic disaster on 15 April. The solemn ceremony is attended by the craft's crew and a dedication statement to the Titanic and her lost passengers is read. = Administration = patch International Ice Patrol From its inception until the beginning of World War II, the Ice Patrol was conducted from two surface patrol cutters alternating surveillance patrols of the southern ice limits. In 1931 and thereafter a third ship was assigned to Ice Patrol to perform oceanographic observations in the vicinity of the Grand Banks. After World War II, aerial surveillance became the primary ice reconnaissance method with surface patrols phased out except during unusually heavy ice years or extended periods of reduced visibility. Use of the oceanographic vessel continued until 1982, when the Coast Guard's sole remaining oceanographic ship, , was converted to a medium endurance cutter. The aircraft has distinct advantages for ice reconnaissance providing much greater coverage in a relatively short period of time. From 1946 until 1966, the Ice Patrol offices, operations center and reconnaissance aircraft were based at the Coast Guard Air Detachment Argentia, Newfoundland during the ice season. Due to changing operational commitments and financial constraints the Coast Guard Argentia Air Detachment closed in 1966. Ice Patrol headquarters and operations center moved to Governors Island, New York where they remained until October 1983. Today the International Ice Patrol is located at the Coast Guard Research and Development Center in New London, Connecticut. The ice reconnaissance detachment, usually composed of eleven aircrew and four ice observers flying in an HC-130 aircraft, continues to work out of Newfoundland. The Ice Patrol disseminates information on icebergs and the limit of all known sea ice via radio broadcast from the U.S. Coast Guard Communications Command (COMMCOM) located in Chesapeake, Virginia via Inmarsat Safetynet, and radio facsimile chart. Ice Patrol information is also available via Internet access. 2002 changes to SOLAS requires ships transiting the region guarded by the Ice Patrol to use the services provided during the ice season. =Aviation history of the International Ice Patrol= * 6 February 1946 - A PBY-5A makes the first International Ice Patrol reconnaissance flight. * 24 February 1946 - Two PB4Y-1s arrive in Argentia, Newfoundland to become the first dedicated Ice Patrol aircraft. * 1 July 1946 - First helicopter deployments in International Ice Patrol.

Holgate played a major role in Montreal's art community, and the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, where he both studied and taught. He was known primarily as a portraitist and for a number of female nudes in outdoor settings that he painted during the 1930s.  Life and career  Edwin Holgate painting in his workshop, Montreal, 1940 Holgate was born in Allandale, Ontario, Canada, the son of Bessie Bell (Headley) and Henry Holgate.http://www.patrimoine- culturel.gouv.qc.ca/rpcq/detail.do?methode=consulter&id;=9205&type;=pge Holgate's family moved to Jamaica in 1895 where his father worked as an engineer. In 1897 he was sent to Toronto to go to school. In 1901 his family returned from Jamaica and settled in Montreal. Holgate studied at the Art Association of Montreal under William Brymner (who also taught A. Y. Jackson), Alberta Cleland and later Maurice Cullen. In 1912, he studied in Paris. He was travelling in the Ukraine at the outset of World War I, and was forced to cross Asia to return to Canada. He returned to France with the Canadian Army. Holgate's first exhibition was held at the Arts Club of Montreal in 1922. He taught wood engraving at the École des Beaux-Arts de Montréal from 1928 to 1934. Holgate was the ninth member of the Group of Seven -- he was invited to join the group in March 1929. In 1934 he was elected an associate of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts. He was elected a full member in 1935. He resigned in 1945 but was reinstated in 1953. He was also a founding member of the Canadian Group of Painters. He worked as a war artist in England during World War II. On his return to Montreal after the war, he found that the arts scene had changed, with the arrival of the Automatistes. He left Montreal to live in the Laurentians in 1946. In 1954 he was one of eighteen Canadian artists commissioned by the Canadian Pacific Railway to paint a mural for the interior of one of the new Park cars entering service on the new Canadian transcontinental train. Each the murals depicted a different national or provincial park; Holgate's was Mont-Tremblant National Park. Holgate died in 1977 and buried at Mount Royal Cemetery in Montreal. The National Gallery of Canada held a retrospective of his work in 1975. The Montreal Museum of Fine Arts organized a second retrospective in 2005. NotesReferences * Harper, Russell.

Such particles were first identified, through their X-ray spectrum, at the KEK proton synchrotron in Tsukuba, Japan in 1997. More detailed studies have been performed at DAFNE in Frascati, Italy. Kaonic hydrogen has been created in very low energy collisions of kaons with the protons in a gaseous hydrogen target. At DAFNE, kaons are produced by the decay of φ mesons which are in turn created in collisions between electrons and positrons. The experiments analyzed X-rays from several electronic transitions in kaonic hydrogen. Unlike in the hydrogen atom, where the binding between electron and proton is dominated by the electromagnetic interaction, kaons and protons interact also to a large extent by the strong interaction. In kaonic hydrogen this strong contribution was found to be repulsive, shifting the ground state energy by 283 ± 36 (statistical) ± 6 (systematic) eV, thus making the system unstable with a resonance width of 541 ± 89 (stat) ± 22 (syst) eV (decay into Λπ and ΣπYiguang Yan, Kaonic hydrogen atom and kaon-proton scattering length, ). Kaonic hydrogen is studied mainly because of its importance for the understanding of kaon-nucleon interactions and for testing quantum chromodynamics.

These are found on either side of the foot protruding above the level of the coronary band. The lateral cartilages support the hoof wall and provide an important role in the support and cushioning provided to the heel. The front feet are most commonly affected. Causes Repeated concussion of the foot is probably the cause in many cases. Such concussion could be produced when a horse is always worked on a hard surface. There also appears to be a hereditary component to sidebone but this may be because bad conformation is hereditary and bad conformation appears to predispose to sidebone. Bad conformation would include * those with narrow, upright feet * those with unbalanced feet, especially if they have toe-in or toe-out conformation * draft horses, or horses with a heavy build, are more likely to develop sidebone than light horses or ponies Symptoms Sidebone may be associated with lameness but many horses with sidebone are not lame. It follows that sidebone often gets blamed for being the cause of lameness when there is actually another cause. Diagnosis Careful examination of the collateral cartilages by palpation can give a good indication that they are solid and bony rather than firm, springy cartilage. Usually, however, sidebone is found accidentally when the foot is radiographed, as sidebone has few outward signs in most cases. In mild cases, there are small areas of calcification; more advanced cases will have ossification of the entire cartilage. Rarely, severe lameness can be caused by fracture of an ossified cartilage, or by ossification which deviates enough to impinge on the short pastern bone. Treatment Sidebone usually does not cause any problems, but when it does it is difficult to treat. Box rest and Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as bute may be useful. In some cases the only useful treatment is a neurectomy of the palmar digital nerves. Prognosis Many horses compete actively in demanding sports with sidebone, and are not hindered in any way. If the ossification is severe and associated with lameness then the prognosis is more guarded. Discovery of sidebone on an equine prepurchase exam without signs of lameness or local sensitivity should not affect the purchaser's opinion of the horse.

He was one of the most brilliant personages of his day, and the most prominent representative of French culture in Sweden. He was also a fine orator. Tessin's art collection became the original core of the collection of Sweden's Nationalmuseum. Life Carl Gustaf Tessin (1695–1770) Carl Gustaf Tessin was born in Stockholm. His father's family were burghers, while his mother came from the nobility; one of his maternal great-great- grandmothers had been born a princess-duchess of Brunswick-Luneburg. This genealogy led some to regard him as \\"trash\\" and a social climber compared to real aristocracy. On the other hand, members of his paternal line had shown high talent artistically and aesthetically; designers, architects, and also political talent. He married Ulrika Sparre in 1727. He began his public career in 1723, at which time he was a member of the Holstein faction, which promoted the claims of the young Duke Carl Frederick of Holstein to the Swedish throne. In 1725 Tessin was appointed ambassador at Vienna, and in that capacity counteracted the plans of the Swedish chancellor, Count Arvid Horn, for joining the anti-Russian Hanoverian Alliance. During the riksdags of 1726–27 and 1731, Tessin fiercely opposed the government, and his wit, eloquence, and imposing presence made him one of the foremost protagonists of the party subsequently known as \\"The Hats\\". From 1735 to 1736 he was again Swedish ambassador at Vienna. During the riksdag of 1738 he was elected marshal of the Riksdag of the Estates and contributed more than anyone else to the overthrow of the Horn administration the same year. Jacques-Andé Aved. Count On the division of the spoil of patronage he chose for himself the post of ambassador extraordinary at Paris, and from 1739 to 1742 delighted Versailles with his brilliant qualities of grand seigneur, at the same time renewing the traditional alliance between France and Sweden which had been interrupted for more than sixty years. His political ability, however, was by no means commensurate with his splendid social qualities. It was his sanguine credulity which committed the Hats to their rash and unconsidered war with Russia in 1741–42, though in fairness it must be added that Tessin helped them out of their difficulties again by his adroitness as party leader and his stirring eloquence. He gained his seat in the senate as a reward for his services on this occasion. In 1743 Tessin attempted to reconcile the long outstanding differences between Sweden and Denmark in a special mission to Copenhagen. In 1744 he was sent at the head of an extraordinary embassade to Berlin to escort to Stockholm Frederick the Great's sister, Louisa Ulrika, the chosen bride of the Swedish crown prince, Adolphus Frederick. As överhovmarskalk of the young court, Tessin speedily captivated the royal pair. He also succeeded in extricating the crown prince from the influence of the Russian Empress Elizabeth of Russia, to whom Adolphus Frederick owed his throne when he became king of Sweden in 1751, thereby essentially contributing to the maintenance of the independence of Sweden. He was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1741. From 1746 to 1752 Tessin was president of the chancellery, as the Swedish prime minister was called in those days. His system aimed at a rapprochement with Denmark with the view of counterbalancing the influence of Russia in the north. It was a dignified and prudent policy, but his endeavour to consolidate it by promoting a matrimonial alliance between the two courts alienated the Swedish crown prince, who, as a Holsteiner, nourished an ineradicable hatred of everything Danish. As, moreover, on the accession of Adolphus Frederick in 1751, Tessin refused to countenance any extension of the royal prerogative, the rupture between him and the court became final. On the occasion of the coronation (1752) he resigned the premiership, and in 1754 the governorship of the young crown prince Gustavus also, spending the rest of his days at his estate at Åkerö Manor, where he died. He was given the L’Ordre de l’Harmonie. Art collection Carl Gustaf Tessin was also an art collector. During his mission in Paris he bought many paintings and drawings, including 2000 drawings from the famous 1741 auction of the former Pierre Crozat collection. Being heavily in debt on his return to Sweden, he was obliged to sell part of his collection to the then King Fredrik I, who gave them to Queen Louisa Ulrika. Part of his art collection is now in the Swedish Nationalmuseum. The collection was on display in New York at the Morgan Library & Museum, \\"Treasures from the Nationalmuseum of Sweden: The Collections of Count Tessin.\\" Principal works by Tessin *Tessin och Tessiniana (1st ed.

This can also be called what-if analysis or back-solving. It can either be attempted through trial and improvement or more logical means. Basic goal seeking functionality is built into most modern spreadsheet packages such as Microsoft Excel. According to O'Brien and Marakas,O’Brien, J & Marakas, G. (2011). Supporting Decision Making. In B.Gordon (Ed.), Management Information Systems 10e (p. 409). New York: McGraw-Hill Irwin optimization analysis is a more complex extension of goal-seeking analysis. Instead of setting a specific target value for a variable, the goal is to find the optimum value for one or more target variables, given certain constraints. Then one or more other variables are changed repeatedly, subject to the specified constraints, until you discover the best values for the target variables. Examples Suppose a family wanted to take out the biggest loan that they could afford to pay for. If they set aside $500 a month, the goal-seeking program would try to work out how big a loan the family could afford to take out. Even using simple trial and improvement, a computer could quickly determine that they could not afford a $50,000 loan, but could afford a $48,000 loan. It would then repeat the process until it had reached a figure such as $48,476.34, which would give them a monthly repayment as close to $500 as possible, without exceeding it. A more efficient method, especially on more complicated calculations, would be for the program to logically work through the argument. By drawing up a simple equation, the program could come to the conclusion that the output equalled one ninety-sixth of the input, and could then multiply the output (or goal) by ninety-six to find the necessary input.

It was discovered by William Herschel in 1784.The NGC/IC Project : NGC Discoverers List by Bob Erdmann. NGC 7331 is the brightest galaxy in the field of a visual grouping known as the NGC 7331 Group of galaxies. The other members of the group are the lenticular or unbarred spirals NGC 7335 and 7336, the barred spiral galaxy NGC 7337 and the elliptical galaxy NGC 7340. These galaxies lie far in the background at distances of approximately 332, 365, 348 and 294 million light years, respectively. The galaxy is similar in size and structure to the Milky Way, and is sometimes referred to as \\"the Milky Way's twin\\". However, discoveries in the 2000s regarding the structure of the Milky Way may call this similarity into doubt, particularly because the latter is now believed to be a barred spiral, compared to the unbarred status of NGC 7331. In spiral galaxies the central bulge typically co-rotates with the disk but the bulge in the galaxy NGC 7331 is rotating in the opposite direction to the rest of the disk.A Counter-rotating Bulge in the Sb Galaxy NGC 7331 , F.

Bitòn Coulibaly (also Mamary Coulibaly, 1689?-1755) founded the Bambara Empire in what is now Mali's Ségou Region and Mopti Region. Great-grandson of former Ségou king Kaladian Coulibaly, Mamary Coulibaly settled in Ségou in his youth and soon became head of the Tòn, a voluntary organization for young men, taking the title of \\"Bitòn.\\" Under Coulibaly's leadership, the Tòn transformed from an egalitarian society into an army of \\"Tondions.\\" Prompted by popular up rise against the king of Ségou, the populace suggested he take over the leadership of the Bambara kingdom. Coulibaly quickly subdued rival chiefs of Ségou through a vote a cloture of the Chiefs and used the city as a capital for his new Bambara Empire. Fortifying himself with defensive techniques from the Songhai tradition, Coulibaly created a thousand-man army and a navy of war canoes to patrol the Niger River, staffing both with men already captured in his conquests. Coulibaly then proceeded to launch successful assaults against his neighbors, the Fulani, the Soninke, and the Mossi; he also attacked Tomboctou, though he held the city only briefly. During this time he also founded the city of Bla as an outpost and armory. Coulibaly's new empire thrived on trade with the Berber to the north due to the Islamic influence, including that of local slaves captured in its many wars. The slaves were drafted in the army, used for labor and or resold to African local traders to the south and west (not European Slave trade); the demand for slaves then fueled the empire on to further wars. Note: Slaves had the right to property and could win their way to nobility as Ngolo Diarra did. Bitòn Coulibaly was succeeded by Dinkoro Coulibaly following his death in 1755 and Ali Coulibaly. However,the slavery was over whelming so he soon stepped down and handed the throne over to his trusted right hand man.

The Derby Canal  In 1792, Benjamin Outram was asked to prepare plans for a broad canal from Swarkestone to Smithy Houses, near Denby, with a branch at Derby to the Erewash Canal at Sandiacre, which he estimated would cost £60,000. The original report has been lost in time with only a dated and signed map drawing surviving in Derbyshire Records Office. William Jessop on 3 November 1792 confirmed Outram's proposals. The Derby Canal Act of 1793 authorized a rail connection between the Derby Canal at Little Eaton and the collieries to the north. The wagonway ran four miles (6 km) from the canal wharf to Smithy Houses and another mile further to Denby Hall Colliery. Further short branches served Salterwood North and Henmoor Collieries as well as the Denby Pottery. The purpose of this long plateway was to carry coal from Kilburn and Denby down to the canal at Little Eaton and general goods including stone, pottery and \\"clogs of wood\\". Construction Outram's original plan was for a conventional waggonway with wooden sleepers and oak rails reinforced with cast iron plates. Accordingly, an advertisement appeared in the Lincoln & Stamford Mercury for 16 August 1793 for oak sleepers long squared at each end for a length of . However, by the time the railway was approved, Outram had decided to use the flanged rails with which his name has become associated. In this he may have been greatly influenced by William Jessop (1745 to 1814) and also by Joseph Butler of Wingerworth near Chesterfield, who had constructed a similar line in 1788. Butler is believed to have been the first to do so in Derbyshire and supplied the rails, rather than Outram's own works. Outram considered himself the first to use stone blocks as sleepers. These were drilled with a hole into which an oak plug was fitted. The rails of cast iron were usually long (he also manufactured long rails when asked) and of L-shaped cross-section, were attached by means of spikes into a notch at the end of the rail. The line was originally gauge, being increased later to at an unknown date. The cast iron plates used to build the track initially weighed although this was increased to for plates made after 1804. By 1825, there were nine passing places on the single-track line, which carried waggons. Each waggon carried a box of coal, with a load of between , which was transferred to a barge at Little Eaton wharf by a crane. From Smithy Houses, several private lines served the Denby Main colliery and other mines in the locality. Further extensions were made between 1827 and 1829, when lines were built to provide links to the colliery owned by Harrison, Pattinson and Davenport at Denby, to Kilburn colliery and to Salterwood pits. The waggons, built at Outram's Butterley works consisted of containers mounted loosely on a chassis, or tram, with four cast iron wheels. The container would be lifted off at Little Eaton and loaded complete into narrowboats or transferred to two-wheeled carts for carriage by road. The canal line from Little Eaton led to Gandy's Wharf in Derby for onward distribution through the canal network or by road and was an early example of a containerised system (see Duke of Bridgewater Canal for first use) The gangway and the Little Eaton line of the canal opened in 1795 to a great ceremonial fanfare with the wagons being kitted out with seats for the dignitaries and a Band to mark the occasion. The first load of coal from Denby was distributed to the poor of Derby. Decline Replica Wagon at the Midland Railway Trust When the Midland Railway built its branch line to Ripley in 1856, it lost most of its trade, finally closing in 1908. The trackbed was used for a new road, the A61, bypassing the old road through Coxbench. This, in turn, was superseded at the end of the twentieth century by the A38 trunk road, demoting it to the B6179. Thus there are three generations of highway side-by-side, plus the remains of the railway. The only remaining trace of the gangway is the Wharf building seen in the photo above, the easternmost arch of Jack O' Darley bridge, and another two arch bridge over the Bottle Brook, with a few of the sleeper stones that have been used in nearby walls. A wagon from this period of the gangway's history was preserved in the National Mining Museum at Lound Hall, Bothamsall and is now in the National Railway Museum.NRM  Collections  Remains of Little Eaton Gangway coal wagon, c 1798 A replica Little Eaton Gangway wagon is on display at the Midland Railway Trust near Ripley.

The killings happened after plainclothes officers approached a Standard Vanguard estate car,The Murders of the Black Museum: 1870-1970 p. 517 in which Roberts and two other men were sitting in Braybrook Street near Wormwood Scrubs prison in London. Roberts feared the officers would discover firearms his gang were planning to use in a robbery. He killed two, while one of his accomplices fatally shot the third. After Roberts had spent nearly 48 years in prison, in 2014 the Parole Board for England and Wales approved his release, at the age of 78. Having far exceeded his minimum term of 30 years, he was one of the United Kingdom's longest-serving prisoners, having remained in custody since 1966. Early life Roberts was born in Wanstead, Essex, on 21 July 1936 where his parents ran The George public house. As a child he became involved in crime by helping his mother sell stolen goods on the black market. Roberts later described how the family owned a café in north London where his mother was \\"...selling on mostly food—tea and sugar—and sometimes ration books. Anything she could get her hands on\\". In his late teens, he was sentenced to detention after using an iron bar to attack a shopkeeper during a robbery. Roberts served a 19-month sentence inside Gaynes Hall borstal, and was released in January 1956. One week after leaving the borstal, Roberts was called up for national service and joined the Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own), with whom he saw action during the Mau Mau Uprising and Malayan Emergency. Of his service in the jungle he said that this was where he learned to kill and that he had \\"personally killed at least four\\". Roberts has claimed that he reached the rank of Sergeant while in the Army although others have given his rank as Lance Corporal. Journalist and former armed robber John McVicar has said that Roberts \\"gloated\\" about his killings while in prison, and had \\"acquired a taste for killing prisoners [of war] on the orders of his officers\\" in the Army. After leaving the Army, Roberts returned to his criminal activities, and in partnership with Jack Witney carried out \\"dozens\\" of armed robberies, targeting bookmakers, post offices and banks. He said, \\"The most I earned was £1,000 from a single job. Witney was the eldest, the boss: he knew the best places to rob. [John] Duddy joined us later.\\" In 1959 Roberts and an accomplice posed as tax inspectors to gain entry into the home of an elderly man. The man was bound, robbed, and beaten about the head with a glass decanter. Roberts was arrested, and at his trial the judge, Mr Justice Maude, said, \\"You are a brutal thug. You came very near the rope this time. It is to be hoped you do not appear before us again.\\" Roberts received a sentence of seven years. Shepherd's Bush murders Following the shootings of 41-year- old Police Constable Geoffrey Fox, Detective Sergeant Christopher Head, aged 30, and 25-year-old Temporary Detective Constable David Wombwell in Shepherd's Bush, West London, Roberts hid in Thorley Wood near Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, to avoid capture. He was familiar with the area from visits there as a child. A £1,000 reward was offered for information leading to his arrest. Roberts used his military training to evade capture for ninety-six days, but was finally caught by police while sleeping rough in a barn at Blount's Farm near Bishop's Stortford. Trial and imprisonment Roberts was convicted of all three murders and sentenced to life imprisonment with a recommended minimum term of 30 years. The murders occurred just eight months after the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965 suspended the death penalty in England, Wales and Scotland and substituted a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment. While in prison, Roberts made several attempts to escape. In 2001, he was moved to an open prison. Roberts was returned to a closed prison within months after allegations that he was involved in drug dealing and contraband smuggling. Author Kate Kray, who interviewed Roberts for her book Natural Born Killers (1999, ), said that he has no remorse for his victims and recreates the murders in art and pastry decorations, making apple pies and decorating them with pastry cut-outs of policemen being shot. Kray said that he also produces \\"precisely drawn and coloured\\" paintings depicting someone shooting a policeman. Appeals In 2005 he failed in his appeal to the House of Lords over the use of secret evidence to keep him in prison. The evidence had been obtained by tapping private phone calls between Roberts and his solicitor. The material was then introduced as evidence at his parole hearings. In September 2006, 70-year-old Roberts applied for a judicial review over apparent delays by the parole board in reaching a decision to free him by the end of the year. In December 2006, he was again turned down for parole. On 29 June 2007, he was given leave to seek a High Court judicial review over his failed parole bid, with the judge saying his case \\"was of great public interest.\\" It was reported in February 2009 that Roberts hoped to be freed from prison within months, having already served 42 years in jail and completing the first stage of a parole board hearing; he believed this would pave the way for his release. Roberts hoped a final hearing would find that at the age of 72 he was no longer a risk to the public and that the parole board would order his immediate release. At this time he had already served 12 years more than the minimum term recommended by his trial judge who at the time of sentencing told Roberts that it was unlikely that any future Home Secretary would \\"ever think fit to show mercy by releasing you on licence... This is one of those cases in which the sentence of imprisonment for 'life' may well be treated as meaning exactly what it says\\". It was recognised that government ministers were concerned that any decision on the matter would provoke public fury and that Roberts' safety might be put at risk but the parole board would nonetheless be powerless to halt the release. Supporters of Roberts had previously claimed that successive Home Secretaries have blocked his release for political reasons because of fears of a public backlash. Peter Smyth, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said that there would be widespread anger among serving and former officers. Legal sources said they believed that the parole board was likely to recommend that he was eligible for an open prison as a way of preparing him for release. Jack Straw, the former Justice Secretary, retained the power to reject a parole board recommendation that Roberts be moved to an open prison but he could not block a decision by the board to order his release. In April 2009, it was alleged by the owners of an animal sanctuary where Roberts was working on day release, that he made violent threats to them. In October 2014 the Parole Board for England and Wales approved his release at an unspecified later date. Roberts was released on 11 November 2014 after serving 48 years in prison (from 15 November 1966). Cultural impact Roberts' name has been used for many years to antagonise the police, with chants like \\"Harry Roberts is our friend, is our friend, is our friend. Harry Roberts is our friend, he kills coppers. Let him out to kill some more, kill some more, kill some more, let him out to kill some more, Harry Roberts\\" as well as \\"He shot three down in Shepherd's Bush, Shepherd's Bush, Shepherd's Bush. He shot three down in Shepherd's Bush, our mate Harry\\" (to the tune of \\"London Bridge Is Falling Down\\"), which originated with groups of young people outside Shepherd's Bush police station after Roberts had been arrested. There have been artistic representations of Roberts. The character of Billy Porter in the 2001 novel He Kills Coppers by Jake Arnott, and the 2008 TV adaptation, is based on Roberts. To the tune of the chant \\"Hari Krishna\\", in the song \\"Happiness Is Just A Chant Away\\" by Chumbawamba on their 1992 album Shhh, the words \\"Hari Krishna\\" are replaced with \\"Harry Roberts\\".

He established communities of Munsee (Lenape) converts to Christianity in the valley of the Muskingum River in Ohio; and for a time, near modern-day Amherstburg, Ontario. Biography Zeisberger was born in Zauchtenthal, Moravia (present day Suchdol nad Odrou in the Czech Republic) and moved with his family to the newly established Moravian Christian community of Herrnhut, on the estate of Count Nicolaus Ludwig von Zinzendorf in the German Electorate of Saxony in 1727. However, when his family migrated to the newly established colony of Georgia, Zeisberger remained in Europe to complete his education. In 1738, he came to Georgia in the Thirteen Colonies, with the assistance of governor of Georgia James Edward Oglethorpe. He later rejoined his family in the Moravian community at Savannah, Georgia. At the time, the United Brethren had begun a settlement, merely for the purpose of preaching the gospel to the Creek Indians. From there he moved to Pennsylvania, and assisted at the commencement of the settlements of Nazareth and Bethlehem. In 1739, Zeisberger was influential in the development of a Moravian community in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and was there at its dedication on Christmas Eve 1741. Four years later, at the invitation of Hendrick Theyanoguin, he came to live among the Mohawk. He became fluent in the Onondaga language and assisted Conrad Weiser in negotiating an alliance between the Thirteen Colonies and the Iroquois in Onondaga (near present-day Syracuse, New York). Zeisberger also produced dictionaries and religious works in Iroquoian and Algonquian.Eben Horsford (editor) (1887) Zeisberger's Indian Dictionary : English, German, Iroquois, Algonquin, Cambridge Massachusetts Zeisberger began as a missionary to Native American peoples following his ordination as a Moravian minister in 1749. He worked among the Lenape (Delaware) of Pennsylvania, focusing his efforts on converting as many Indians as possible to Christianity. He was the senior missionary of the United Brethren (as the Moravians sometimes referred to themselves) among the Indians. His relations with the British took a turn for the worse during the American Revolutionary War (as they suspected he was providing aid to the American patriots, and in 1781 he was arrested and detained at Fort Detroit. While he was detained, ninety-six of his Native converts in Gnadenhutten, Ohio were brutally murdered by Pennsylvania militiamen, an event known as the Gnadenhutten Massacre. After Zeisberger was released, violent conflicts with other Native tribes and the expansion of white settlement forced many Moravian Christian settlements to relocate to present-day Michigan and Ontario. A large group of Munsee moved there in 1782, but Zeisberger later returned to live the rest of his life among the Native converts remaining near the village of Goshen (in present Goshen Township, Tuscarawas County, Ohio). Zeisberger spent a period of 62 years, excepting a few short intervals, as a missionary among the Indians. He died on November 17, 1808 at Goshen, Ohio, on the river Tuscarawas, at the age of 87 years. Zeisberger is buried in Goshen.

The instrument is known by various names within the region, including la gyan hsaing (), la gyan kye waing (လခြမ်းကြေးဝိုင်း), khong mon (, ) and kong mon (). In the Mon language, it is called naung not () or pat kon cao (, lit. \\"ten child gongs\\"). Design and variations The pat kon consists of about a dozen (10 - 15) gongs mounted in a vertical crescent-shaped wooden frame. It produces the same range of pitches as the more common gong circles (such as the Kong toch and khong wong), but rather than resting on the ground, the wooden frame of this instrument extends into the air in the shape of a horseshoe. The instrument was formerly used in nat (spirit) propitiation ceremonies, and originally consisted of 14 gongs, but a 15th gong was added in 1962, tuned to the fifth note. The instrument's wooden frame is made of beechwood (Gmelina arborea), with rattan used to suspend the individual gongs. The wooden frame is embellished with traditional arabesque or kanok designs, inlaid with glass mosaic, and carvings depicting a stylized kinnari bird or devas. The image of a half-man, half-bird figure carved onto the frame is traditional, and is meant to symbolize a celestial musician.

Originally established by Danes in the 13th century, it is the oldest church in Tallinn and mainland Estonia. It is also the only building in Toompea which survived a 17th-century fire.Toomkirik Originally a Roman Catholic cathedral, it became Lutheran in 1561 and now belongs to the Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church. It is the seat of the Archbishop of Tallinn, the spiritual leader of the Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church, and chairman of that church's governing synod.  History  The first church was made of wood most likely already and built by 1219, when the Danes invaded Tallinn. In 1229, when the Dominican friars arrived, they started building a stone church replacing the old wooden one. The monks were killed in a conflict between the Knights of the Sword and vassals supporting the Pope’s legate in 1233 and the church was thus desecrated. A letter asking permission to consecrate it anew was sent to Rome in 1233 and this is the first record of the church’s existence.Official home page The Dominicans couldn’t finish the building. Actually, they built only the base walls. The building was completed in 1240 and it was a one-aisled building with a rectangular chancel. In 1240, it was also named cathedral and consecrated in honour of Virgin Mary. In the beginning of the 14th century, reconstruction of the church began. The church was made bigger. The reconstruction began with building a new chancel. At about the same time, the new vestry was built. The enlargement of the one-aisled building to a three-aisled building began in the 1330s. The construction work, however, lasted almost 100 years. The new longitudinal part of the church, 29 meters long, built by following the principles of basilica, was completed in the 1430s. The nave’s rectangular pillars had been completed in the second half of the 14th century, though. The church suffered considerable damage in the great fire of 1684 when the entire wooden furnishings were destroyed. Some vaults collapsed and many stone-carved details were severely damaged- especially in the chancel. In 1686, after the fire, the church was practically rebuilt to restore it to its previous state. The new pulpit with figures of the apostles (1686) and the altarpiece (1696) were made by the Estonian sculptor and carver Christian Ackermann. The Dome Church’s exterior dates from the 15th century, the spire dates from the 18th century. Most of the church’s furnishings go back to the 17th and 18th centuries. From 1778 to 1779, a new baroque spire was built in the western part of the nave. One should also mention the numerous different kinds of tombstones from 13th –18th century, the stone-carved sarcophagi from the 17th century, also the altar and chancel, chandeliers, numerous coats-of arms from the 17th – 20th centuries. Two of the church’s four bells date back to 17th century, two date to the 18th century. The organ was made in 1914. Among the people buried in the cathedral are the Bohemian nobleman Jindřich Matyáš Thurn, one of leaders of the Protestant revolt against emperor Ferdinand II and in events that led to the Thirty Years' War; the Swedish soldier Pontus De la Gardie and his wife, Sofia Johansdotter Gyllenhielm (John III's daughter); as well as the Scotsman Samuel Greig (formerly Samuil Karlovich Greig of the Russian Navy); the Swedish field marshals and cousins Otto Wilhelm and Fabian von Fersen; and the Russian navigator, Adam Johann von Krusenstern.

Biography Adriaen van der Cabel, Port of Genua, 1660 He was born and grew up in the small town of Rijswijk, near The Hague. Cabel was also known as Ary. According to Houbraken, he was a student of Jan van Goyen, and his real name was van der Touw (English: \\"of String\\"), but that wasn't grand enough according to Van Goyen, so he changed it to mean \\"of Cable\\".Ary vander Kabel biography in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature Houbraken wrote that his brother Engel was also a painter, and that Adriaen was already living in Lyon when Johannes Glauber made his grand tour. Cabel moved to Lyon as a young man and spent the rest of his life there. According to the RKD, he lived in Lyon from 1655-1658, then Rome from 1659–1666, and finally Lyon again from 1668 to his death.Adriaen van der Kabel in the RKD His bentname was Geestigheid. His work is sometimes confused with that of his brother Engel van der Cabel (1641-after 1695), also known as Ange or Angelo. Engel accompanied his brother on his travels and they both married on the same day.

Like van der Cabel, Manglard moved to Rome, where he became one of the best known landscape painters of his day.

Unlike a conventional hot air balloon where people ride inside a basket, there is no basket on a hopper balloon. Instead, the hopper pilot usually sits on a seat or wears a harness similar to a parachute harness. Hoppers are typically flown for recreation. These aircraft are sometimes called \\"Cloud Hoppers\\" or \\"Cloudhoppers.\\" However, these terms formally refer to the products of a particular manufacturer, specifically Lindstrand Balloons. Nonetheless, \\"Cloudhopper\\" is used by many people as a genericized trademark, which refers to all craft of this general type. Most hopper balloons have envelopes that range in volume from and have a maximum flight duration of 1 to 1.5 hours. The two principal commercial balloon manufacturers today offering hopper balloons for sale are Cameron Balloons and Lindstrand Balloons. Most other hopper balloons are experimental aircraft designed and built by amateur constructors. History Balloon-jumping as a sport emerged in the United States as early as 1923,Edward Brooke-Hitching. Fox Tossing, Octopus Wrestling, and Other Forgotten Sports, p.19. Simon and Schuster, 2015. and in England not later than 1927. Balloon-jumping really meant jumping for many enthusiasts: with insufficient buoyancy to sustain flight, the balloonists actually had to use their muscles to start a balloon- assisted hop. In the United States helium was hailed as the choice lifting gas due to its fire safety, allowing the balloonists to smoke while airborne; elsewhere, hydrogen was common, but hot air balloons were not. Hopper balloons, or jumping balloons, consisting of nothing more than an air bag and a suspension sling with a primitive bench, were immediately employed by operators of large airships and stratospheric balloons as cheap tools for inspecting and repairing aircraft surfaces. The tool was especially handy, since the safest places to launch large high-altitude balloons (Stratobowl and Crosby, Minnesota iron pits) were located in remote places without real airport facilities. In one instance, the second launch of Georgy Prokofiev's ill-fated USSR-3, it took two hopper balloons to untie the tangled nets on top of the giant balloon: the first jumper fell off his bench but managed to hold on to the balloon's cables and survived. The first modern hot air balloon was flown by Ed Yost under sponsorship by the U.S. Office of Naval Research on October 22, 1960, in Bruning, Nebraska. Since Yost's balloon had a small envelope of and a chair for the pilot, not a basket, this was arguably also the first hopper balloon flown since the golden age of airships in 1930s. Cloudhopper The name Cloudhopper is often used to refer to a one-person hot air balloon where the pilot sits in a harness or small seat. There is often a propane tank behind the pilot's back, and the burner is on a frame above the pilot's head. Often the balloon's burner, tank, and pilot's harness can swivel independently of the hot air balloon envelope, to let the pilot turn to any direction in flight and for landing. The term \\"Cloudhopper\\" was originally coined and trademarked by British balloonist Colin Prescot. The development of the Cloudhopper was carried out by Per Lindstrand of Colt Balloons in 1979. Colt Balloons later merged with Thunder Balloons to form Thunder & Colt Balloons, which inherited the Cloudhopper name. Finally, Per Lindstrand left Thunder & Colt to form his own Lindstrand Balloons, which manufactures the present-day Cloudhopper. Shortly after the team at Colt built and flew its first Cloudhopper, Cameron Balloons came up with its own backpack-style balloon, called the SkyHopper. Its main distinguishing feature was a twist-grip mounted on an arm rest to control the burner. On the original Colt Cloudhopper, as well as all modern-day Cloudhopper designs, the burner controls are mounted at the bottom of the burner, like on regular passenger- carrying hot air balloons.

Splint bones are attached to the cannon by the interosseous (suspensory) ligament, providing some mobility in the young horse. As the horse ages, the interosseous ligament is typically replaced by bone. In some older horses, the cannon and splint bones may become completely fused. Causes Direct trauma, such as from an interference injury or a kick from another horse, is a common causes of splints. The periosteum is damaged by the trauma, and the horse's body lays down new bone in the injured area. Splints caused by trauma are more commonly seen lower down the leg than ones caused by strain. The splints may occur in a front leg or hind, in one leg or both. Severe enough trauma can fracture the splint bone. If minimally displaced, and in the lower portion, some heal well. Others may need surgical removal of a portion of the damaged splint bone. Concussion is another cause of splints. Concussive forces run from the carpus or tarsus into the splint bones. Working a horse on hard surfaces increases the concussion received by the interosseous ligament, which causes tearing. Splints caused by concussion are usually found on both front legs, most commonly on the inside of the leg a few inches below the knee. Overworking young or unfit horses at speed or in tight circles may cause splints. The uneven loading of the limb in tight circles places excessive force on the medial splint, which can cause it to move excessively relative to the cannon bone, causing tears in the interosseous ligament and periosteal reaction. Bench-kneed conformation causes excess loading of the medial splint bone, which can lead to splints. Blind splints Because the splint bone does have some mobility independent of the cannon bone, it can cause tension and strain on the periosteum of the splint bone where the interosseous ligament attaches. The horse will then lay down new bone and the area will become inflamed. \\"Blind splints\\" are named because the bony reaction happens on the inside border between the splint bone and cannon bone, where it can not be seen, and is usually not palpable. Besides causing pain as any active splint reaction can, the swelling can impinge on the suspensory ligament. This condition is difficult to diagnose, but ultrasound is generally diagnostic. MRI and CT also show these well. Symptoms Splints usually cause mild lameness (a grade of 1–2 out of 5). The injured area is hot, painful, and inflamed with a small bony swelling. However, splints do not always cause lameness, especially once \\"cold\\". More severe lameness is sometimes associated with a fractured splint bone, or soft tissue injury adjacent to the splints. \\"Blind splints\\" usually produce mild lameness that is difficult to pinpoint because there is no obvious swelling, pain, or bony changes related to the exterior of the splint bone. At times, bone proliferation on the axial border of the splint bone can be seen radiographically, but ultrasound is much more sensitive for detecting blind splints. The body will eventually absorb some of the bone it placed down in the splint, flattening out the splint over several months and possibly making it completely disappear. A splint involving the cannon alone is more likely to disappear than one involving the splint bone itself. Treatment The horse should have a reduced workload for 1–3 weeks. If a trainer does not decrease the workload sufficiently, and the splint bone continues to receive concussion, the injury is likely to continue or worsen. Light exercise on soft ground is best for a horse with splints, as work can help encourage the needed bone growth to heal the splint. Those trainers concerned with the cosmetic appearance of their horse usually prefer to hand-walk twice daily and keep the animal stalled until the splint is resolved, eliminating the chance that the splint will accidentally be knocked during work and the swelling increased. Several days of cold therapy, sweats, and NSAIDs can help a \\"hot\\" splint. NSAIDs can help reduce the inflammation and help the bone growth by doing so. However, none of these treatments are incredibly effective. The most important factor is time. Counter-irritants, which increase inflammation, only hinder the formation of bone and can actually prolong the healing process. Surgery to remove the fractured end of the splint bone, particularly in the lower third, is typically successful. However, surgical removal of the bone growth in large splints, performed by chiseling it away, usually does not produce satisfying results. Often, bone growth is stimulated by the surgery, and the size of the splint is increased. Only about a third of the time is surgery at all successful. Prognosis Prognosis is excellent in uncomplicated cases. The horse will be able to return to full work once the inflammation and pain ceases. Although the horse usually recovers quite quickly, horses with \\"blind splints\\" may take longer because there may be impingement on the suspensory ligament. The calcification of the splint is usually a permanent blemish, though over a period of many years, the excess calcification may be reabsorbed to some degree, occasionally to the point that the splint is no longer visible.

It superseded the RPG-43, RPG-40 and RPG-6 series of grenades. It entered service in 1950, but is still used by Iraqi and Afghan insurgents in the 2000s and 2010s, against vehicles of NATO forces. Design RKG stands for Ruchnaya Kumulyativnaya Granata (\\"handheld shaped-charge grenade\\"). The grenade has an odd strap-like lever (or \\"spoon\\") that covers the base of the handle and runs up each side of the handle. When the pin is pulled, the \\"spoon\\" falls away, and when the grenade is thrown a spring deploys a four-panelled drogue parachute. This parachute stabilizes the grenade in flight and ensures that the grenade strikes the target at a 90 degree angle, maximising the effect of the shaped charge. Realistic accurately thrown ranges are within 15 to 25 meters. The lethality radius is within 2 meters from concussion and fragmentation. The casualty radius is within 20 meters and the danger space from fragmentation is within 50 meters. The fuze in the handle activates the grenade. When the parachute deploys, its ejection throws a weight to the rear of the handle and disables the safety. When it impacts or stops, inertia causes the weight to fly forward and hit the spring-loaded firing pin, which activates the primer detonator in the base. This sets off the booster charge in the base of the shaped charge, detonating and enhancing the main charge. The sensitive fuze guarantees that the grenade will detonate if it impacts any target. Armour penetration depends on the model. The original RKG-3 used a basic shaped charge with a steel liner and had a penetration of 125 mm against Rolled Homogeneous Armor (RHA). The RKG-3M used a copper-lined shaped-charge warhead and had a penetration of 165 mm; the RKG-3T had an improved copper liner that had a penetration of 170 mm. The RKG-3EM has a larger warhead and boasts a penetration of 220 mm. History The RKG-3 was adopted into service in 1950. A few years later it was replaced by the improved RKG-3M and enhanced RKG-3T. Thicker top armor caused the Soviets to develop the larger RKG-3EM. In early 1970s the Soviet Army replaced this grenade with the RPG-18, but many other countries and guerrilla movements are still using the RKG-3 in their armed forces. It was used extensively during the 1973 Yom Kippur War. Ulrike Meinhof was injured by an RKG-3 while training with the PLO in a Syrian training camp.

It is usually expressed in a number of years either starting from the filing date of the patent application or from the date of grant of the patent. In most patent laws, annuities or maintenance fees have to be regularly paid in order to keep the patent in force. Thus, a patent may lapse before its term if a renewal fee is not paid in due time.  International harmonization  Significant international harmonization of patent term across national laws was provided in the 1990s by the implementation of the WTO's Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs Agreement). Article 33 of the TRIPs Agreement provides that :\\"The term of protection available [for patents] shall not end before the expiration of a period of twenty years counted from the filing date.\\" Consequently, in most patent laws nowadays, the term of patent is 20 years from the filing date of the application. This however does not forbid the states party to the WTO from providing, in their national law, other type of patent-like rights with shorter terms. Utility models are an example of such rights. Their term is usually 6 or 10 years.  Jurisdiction = Europe = The European Patent Convention requires all jurisdictions to give a European patent a term of 20 years from the actual date of filing an application for a European patent or the actual date of filing an international application under the PCT designating the EPO. The actual date of filing can be up to a year after the earliest priority date. The term of a granted European patent may be extended under national law if national law provides term extension to compensate for pre-marketing regulatory approval. For EEA member states this is by means of a supplementary protection certificate. = United States = In the United States, for utility patents filed on or after June 8, 1995, the term of the patent is 20 years from the earliest filing date of the application on which the patent was granted and any prior U.S. or Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) applications from which the patent claims priority (excluding provisional applications). For patents filed prior to June 8, 1995, the term of patent is either 20 years from the earliest filing date as above or 17 years from the issue date, whichever is longer. Extensions may be had for certain administrative delays. The patent term will additionally be adjusted to compensate for delays in the issuance of a patent. The reasons for extensions include: * Delayed response to an application request for patent. * Exceeding 3 years to consider a patent application. * Delays due to a secrecy order or appeal. Because of significant backlog of pending applications at the USPTO, the majority of newly issued patents receive some adjustment that extends the term for a period longer than 20 years. For design patents (patents based on decorative, non-functional features), for design applications filed on or after May 13, 2015 the term is 15 years from the issue date. For design applications filed before May 13, 2015, the term is 14 years from the issue date.http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/s1505.html See also *Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, provides what is called the \\"priority year\\" *Patent cliff, when the patent expiration leads to an abrupt drop in sales *Provisional patent application *Submarine patent *Supplementary protection certificate (SPC), provides a limited time extension to the protection conferred by certain patents in the European Union ReferencesFurther reading * United States ** - Contents and term of patent; provisional rights ** 2701 Patent Term - 2700 Patent Terms and Extensions in Manual of Patent Examining Procedure (MPEP), USPTO Category:Patent law Category:Time in government ","title":"Term of patent"},{"id":"2286885","text":"Brenda Olive Fowlie (born May 15, 1953) is a journalist and politician in the Canadian provinceof New Brunswick.

She was originally declared the winner in 2003 by a margin of 16 votes and a recount delayed the swearing in of the cabinet and the first session of the legislature.

The group, upon formally repudiating Trotskyism, renamed themselves the International Leninist Workers Party and later the Economic and Philosophic Science Review.

Ruz Lhuillier is sometimes referred to as the \\"Hitchcock of Archaeology\\". Early life Ruz Lhuillier was born in Paris, France to a Cuban father and a French mother. He went to college in Havana, Cuba, where he learned about the impact of American interference in Cuban affairs and he became deeply involved in the socialist revolution to oust Cuba’s US puppet dictators and to free his country from ‘yanqui’ imperialism. In addition, these early student life experiences exposed him to other students who espoused the theories and ideas of Karl Marx. Later Ruz would use some of these theories to explain the development and fall of ancient Maya civilization. He moved to Mexico in 1936, later acquiring Mexican citizenship. Career After the unexpected death of Miguel Ángel Fernández in 1945, Ruz Lhuillier took charge of the INAH's investigations at Palenque. While he served as the INAH's southern Director of Pre-Hispanic Monuments, Ruz Lhuillier excavated much of the city and restored and conserved such edifices as the Palace. In 1948, he discovered the entrance to the tomb of the Maya ruler, K'inich Janaab' Pakal, hidden beneath the Temple of the Inscriptions.

A unit trust pools investors' money into a single fund, which is managed by a fund manager. Unit trusts offer access to a wide range of investments, and depending on the trust, it may invest in securities such as shares, bonds, gilts, and also properties, mortgage and cash equivalents. Those investing in the trust own \\"units\\" whose price is called the \\"net asset value\\" (NAV). The number of these units is not fixed and when more is invested in a unit trust (by investors opening accounts or adding to their accounts), more units are created.

Different investment structures There are a number of collective investment schemes — Unit Trust, Open-ended investment company, Mutual fund, Unit investment trust, Closed-end fund — with similar objectives and/or names, sometimes confused with each other. Variations include open-ended and closed- ended, business trust or management company/corporate structure, Actively managed or un-managed. In the UK there are generally two types of open-ended, actively managed investment companies: *Unit Trusts - which are organized as a business trust where the legal owner of the underlying assets is the trustee and the investors/unit-holders are beneficiaries. Unit Trusts have a \\"bid–offer spread\\", i.e. the investor pays more to buy units of the trust then they receive when they sell them—a difference that can vary and goes to the trust management as a profit. *Open-ended investment company - which have a company, not trust, form. They also have a single price for purchase and sale of units (no bid–offer spread), making them similar to European SICAVs and U.S. mutual funds. In Western Europe there are *SICAV - (société d'investissement à capital variable) is an open-ended collective investment scheme common in Western Europe, especially Luxembourg, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Malta, France and the Czech Republic.Akciová společnost s proměnlivým základním kapitálem (SICAV) – právní a daňová specifika EPRAVO.CZ 8.4.2013 *SICAF - (Société d'Investissement À Capital Fixe) is similar to a closed-end fund. In the United States *Mutual funds - in the form of open- ended, actively managed funds have traditionally been a very popular form of collective investment. Like Unit Trusts, their investors are unit-holders, and there are not a finite number of units in issue. Units could be increased or decreased depending on the net sales and repurchase by existing unit holders. Unlike Unit trusts they are limited liability companies where investors are like shareholders in a company. While open-ended mutual funds do not have a bid–offer spread, they may have \\"loads\\" (sale charges) and other fees paid to fund management. *Closed-end funds - a collective investment model based on issuing a fixed number of shares which are not redeemable from the fund.Lemke, Lins and Smith, Regulation of Investment Companies, §9.05 (Matthew Bender, 2014 ed.). Even more different from a unit trust, investors own shares rather than units. They buy and sell the shares on the stock market, rather than from the fund itself. New shares are not created by managers to meet demand from investors. *Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) - also traded in the market and not bought and redeemed from the fund, but unlike closed-end funds the price is not completely determined by the valuation of the market, and trades in a narrow range very close to its net asset value, because the structure of ETFs allows major market participants to redeem shares of an ETF for a \\"basket\\" of the fund's underlying assets. (More than US$2 trillion were invested in ETFs in the United States between when they were introduced in 1993 and 2015.) *Unit investment trust - an exchange-traded fund with a fixed (unmanaged) portfolio of securities and a fixed life-span before it liquidates and distributes its net asset value as proceeds to the unit-holders. Despite its similar name and being a trust, it differs from a unit trust in being closed- end, un-managed, and having a termination date.Lemke, Lins and Smith, Regulation of Investment Companies, §4.03 (Matthew Bender, 2014 ed.). Structure * Unitholders are the owners of trust property and the trustee administers the trust. * The trustee has a fiduciary duty to ensure that unit holders are treated equally. * The fund manager is appointed by the trustee to manage the investment of the trust assets. * The fund manager runs the trust for a management fee and sometimes for a performance fee. * Trust profits are either distributed to unitholders as income or reflected in the unit prices as capital gain when sold. * The trustee ensures the fund manager keeps to the fund's investment objective. * The trustee or fund manager can appoint a custodian to safeguard the trust assets. * The trustee is required to maintain a registry to allow the transaction of units. =Open-ended= Unit trusts are open-ended; the fund is equitably divided into units which vary in price in direct proportion to the variation in value of the fund's net asset value. Each time money is invested, new units are created to match the prevailing unit buying price; each time units are redeemed the assets sold match the prevailing unit selling price. In this way there is no supply or demand created for units and they remain a direct reflection of the underlying assets. Unit trust trades do not have any commission. =Bid–offer spread= The fund manager makes a profit in the difference between the purchase price of the unit or offer price and the sale value of units or the bid price. This difference is known as the bid–offer spread. The bid–offer spread will vary depending on the type of assets held and can be anything from a few basis points on very liquid assets like UK/US government bonds, to 5% or more on assets that are harder to buy and sell such as property. The trust deed often gives the manager the right to vary the bid–offer spread to reflect market conditions, with the purpose of allowing the manager to control liquidity. In some jurisdictions the bid–offer spread is referred to as the \\"bid–ask spread\\". To cover the cost of running the investment portfolio the manager will collect an annual management charge or AMC. Typically this is 1 to 2 percent of the market value of the fund. In addition to the annual management charge, costs incurred in managing and dealing the underlying assets will often be borne by the trust. If this is the case, the provider will extract revenue equal to the AMC without incurring any expenses managing the fund. This makes the charges in such vehicles lack transparency. =Mechanics= In a unit trust, units are managed within what is known as the \\"Managers Box\\". The Box Manager of the fund will make a decision at each valuation point whether or not to Create (add) or to Liquidate (Remove) units based on the final net sales and redemptions prior to the next valuation point where the Fund is priced on a \\"Forward Basis\\", or at the actual valuation point where the fund is priced on an Historic basis. Forward pricing is the most common. The underlying value of the assets is always directly represented by the total number of units issued multiplied by the unit price less the transaction or management fee charged and any other associated costs. Each fund has a specified investment objective to determine the management aims and limitations. A unit is created when money is invested and cancelled when money is divested. The creation price and cancellation price do not always correspond with the offer and bid price. Subject to regulatory rules these prices are allowed to differ and relate to the highs and lows of the asset value throughout the day. The trading profits based on the difference between these two sets of prices are known as the box profits. =OEIC conversion= In the UK many unit trust managers have converted to open-ended investment companies (OEICs) in recent years. OEICs normally have a single price for purchase and sale, although recent regulatory change now permits dual pricing too, in line with unit trusts. The motivation for conversion is often cited as a simplification and precursor to offering funds Europe-wide under EU rules. More cynical observers may have noted that there is increased latitude to hide charges in the OEIC Dilution Adjustment (more commonly referred to as \\"Swinging Single Price\\") whilst maintaining the veneer of simplification . History The first unit trust was launched in the UK in 1931 by M&G; under the inspiration of Ian Fairbairn. The rationale behind the launch was to emulate the comparative robustness of US mutual funds through the 1929 Wall Street crash. The first trust called the 'First British Fixed Trust' held the shares of 24 leading companies in a fixed portfolio that was not changed for the fixed lifespan of 20 years. The trust was relaunched as the M&G; General Trust and later renamed as the Blue Chip Fund By 1939 there were around 100 trusts in the UK, managing funds in the region of £80 million.For more details of the trust origin of the unit trust and its relationship with American mutual funds, see Ways to invest In the UK, units can be bought direct from the fund manager, held through a nominee account or through an individual savings account (ISA). It is also possible to invest via fund platforms. From 1 January 1987 to 5 April 1999 it was also possible to invest via a personal equity plan (PEP) however these were discontinued and all PEP accounts automatically became stocks and shares ISAs on 6 April 2008.

It is a remake of the classic Dungeons & Dragons adventure The Temple of Elemental Evil using the 3.5 edition rules. This is the only video game to take place in the Greyhawk campaign setting, and the first video game to implement the 3.5 edition rule set. The game was published by Atari, who then held the interactive rights of the Dungeons & Dragons franchise. The Temple of Elemental Evil was released in autumn of 2003 and was criticized for stability issues and other bugs. The turn-based tactical combat, however, was generally thought to be implemented well, and is arguably the most faithful representation of the then-current tabletop role-playing game (\\"3.5e\\") rules in a video game.  Gameplay  A radial menu is used for choosing a character's actions The game focuses on a party of up to five player- controlled characters. These characters can be created by the player or can be one of the pre-made characters that come with the game. All, however, must be within one step of a party alignment. Any player-made characters are created in a 13-step process; there is, however, an option to let the game deal with most aspects of character creation for the player. At any time, the party can have up to three NPC followers, and all player characters can have a familiar and/or animal companion as allowed by class. All characters have a screen that shows information pertaining to them. Five tabs—inventory, skills, feats, spells, and abilities—allow the player to manage equipment, change spell configurations, and compare character attributes. This screen also appears when the party is bartering with an NPC or looting a body, but clicking out of the inventory tab will eject the player from the interaction. Additionally, small portraits of the characters appear on the bottom of the screen, along with a small red bar showing remaining health and icons depicting any status conditions, such as level drain, blessings, or paralysis. The characters are controlled via radial menus. After selecting a character, the player right clicks to open a circular menu. From there, hovering over wedges brings out more options, such as specific spells, actions, or inventory items. The main radial menu, which encircles a picture of the character selected, has up to six sections, the number being based on class abilities. Specific actions are color-coded based on the type of action they are. Characters can use their skills throughout the game by selecting them on the radial menu. If a player wanted to pick another character's pocket, he or she would select a character with the Sleight of Hand skill, left-click on the skill from the radial menu, and left click on the victim. Dialog skills, such as Intimidate and Gather Information, appear as options in dialog with an icon denoting the skill being used. Skills are increased every level at a rate derived from the character's class and Intelligence. Combat is turn-based, with characters going individually based on their initiative. Each character can make five types of actions: free, no, full-round, move, and standard. Characters can take a move action and a standard action each turn. Full-round actions count as a use of both actions. Free actions take a negligible amount of time to perform, so they count as neither actions. No actions also count for neither actions, but they require special circumstances in order to be performed. Characters can choose special attacks to perform or spells to cast, and they can also choose to attack or cast in specific ways. Defensive casting and fighting, dealing non-lethal damage, tripping an opponent, and coup de graces are examples of particular actions in combat. Characters have a set yet semi-random number of hit points based on their level, class, and Constitution score. Upon being reduced to zero hit points, a character is staggered, and a full round action will cost him or her one hit point. A creature with hit points between −1 and −9 is unconscious, and loses one hit point a round. The character has a 10% chance of stabilizing, which will stop the loss of hit points but will keep the character unconscious. Other characters can stop this loss of life through a successful heal check. If a character or creature reaches −10 hit points, it dies. Although most of the main rules from 3.5 edition of Dungeons & Dragons are implemented, there are several exceptions. Some of them, such as applying a bonus to AC from the Dodge feat, are simplified to streamline play. Others, such as not letting prone characters attack, are implemented to reduce the number of required animations. The structure of the engine is also utilized, allowing encumbered characters to move at 3/4 their maximum rate, even if the resulting speed is not a whole number. Certain abilities, including Barbarian Rage, are modified to better flow with the game. A hybridization of some rules also occurred; the spell Doom is modified to reflect the first printing of the Player's Handbook, and weapon sizes are a blend of 3 and 3.5 editions. The game also has two difficulty levels, Normal and Ironman, with the latter intended to more closely mimic the paper-and-pencil game.  Plot  Thirteen years before the start of the game, Hommlet was a peaceful town. Due to low taxes and safe roads, the area became prosperous, and the village flourished. This prosperity drew the attention of evil forces, who began slowly trickling into the area. It is not known where these forces came from, but the Dyvers of Nyr Dyv and the inhabitants of the forestlands of the Wild Coast were the chief suspects. As the presence of bandits, kobolds, and goblins increased, a local militia led by Waldgraf of Ostverk was raised to defend Hommlet. This only served to check the evil forces, however. Six miles from Hommlet, a group of hovels formed a center for the evil activity. The locals ignored this threat since it was in the marshes, and Nulb began growing. A small chapel built to an evil god grew into a stone structure as the evil forces pillaged and robbed the lands around Hommlet. For three years the Temple of Elemental Evil served as a center for the swarms of vile creatures who plagued Hommlet. As the evil grew in power, the land around the Temple suffered from pestilence, famine, and a lack of commerce. The leaders of the Temple grew too power-hungry, and they were defeated in the Battle of Emridy Meadows after challenging the kingdoms of the north. The evil forces were slaughtered, and their mighty Temple was destroyed and sealed with magic and blessings. In the years that followed, Hommlet became a destination for adventurers, who brought wealth to the city and returned the area to its peaceful origins. Eventually, adventurers stopped coming, and the village went back to life as usual. A year before the start of the game, however, bandits once again began trickling into the region, and the villagers appealed to the Lord the Viscount of Verbobonc for aid. He responded by providing funds for Burne and Rufus, two well-known adventurers from the area, to build a keep just outside Hommlet. = Story = The game begins with an opening vignette that is determined by the alignment of the party. All of these require the player to start in the town of Hommlet. After arriving in town and completing minor quests for the townsfolk, the player is directed to the moathouse, a small, fortified outpost to the east. The moathouse is home to bandits, and the player is asked to clear them out. However, in the dungeons of the moathouse, the player encounters a large force of bugbears led by an ogre named Lubash and a priest of the Temple of Elemental Evil, Lareth the Beautiful. After defeating Lareth, the player can then go to either the Temple itself, or to Nulb, a town in the swamplands nearby. If the player goes to Nulb, many of the citizens will talk of the Temple. Spies for the Temple are living in the town, and the player can gain passage into the heart of the Temple by pretending to be interested in joining. The Temple is divided into four factions: Earth, Air, Water, and Fire Temples. Each Temple is at war with the other three in a perpetual struggle for supremacy. The player is asked by all four to provide assistance, and can gain access to Hedrak, the leader of the Temple of Elemental Evil, by performing quests for the sub-Temples. Most of the sub-Temples require the player to kill a leader of an opposing Temple to gain access to Hedrak. Upon meeting Hedrak, the player has two options: kill him, or accept his quest. If the player accepts the quest, which is to kill Scoorp the Hill giant, Hedrak will make the player a part of the Temple of Elemental Evil, thus ending the game. If the player kills Hedrak, the way to four nodes of elemental power will be available. Inside each of these nodes is a gem. These gems can be inserted into the Orb of Golden Death, which is hidden inside the Temple, to form a powerful artifact. Deep inside the Temple, the player must then deal with Zuggtmoy, the Demoness Lady of fungus. The player can, based on choices made, fight Zuggtmoy, fight a weaker version of Zuggtmoy, or avoid a fight altogether. This can lead to one of three endings if the player succeeds: Zuggtmoy is banished for 66 years, Zuggtmoy is destroyed permanently, or Zuggtmoy lives on, but the player is well rewarded.  Development The Temple of Elemental Evil was intended as re-creation of the classic Dungeons & Dragons module of the same name. The publisher was Atari, who then held the interactive rights to the Dungeons & Dragons franchise. Its developer was Troika Games, who began the project on February 1, 2002 with a development team of 14 people. The game was first announced on January 9, 2003 under the title Greyhawk: The Temple of Elemental Evil. It was developed with an enhanced version of the Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura game engine. Originally the designers intended to use the Dungeons & Dragons 3.0 edition rule set, but decided in mid-development to use the 3.5 edition rule set instead. In order to complete this adaptation, Atari gave Troika an additional two months of development time, extending their deadline to August 1. However, the game was not completed until August 30. Some of the reasons for this included the need for extensive testing and the creation of unique play experiences for characters of different alignments. The game went gold on September 4, 2003, 19 days before it was originally intended to be shipped.  Reception  With sales of 128,000 copies and revenues of $5.2 million by February 2005, The Temple of Elemental Evil was less commercially successful than Arcanum, Troika Games' previous release. GameDaily characterized both games' commercial performances as substandard, and as contributing factors to Troika's closure in 2005. The Temple of Elemental Evils critical reception was \\"mixed or average\\", according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. The game was reviewed in 2004 in Dragon #321 by Clifford Horowitz in the \\"Silicon Sorcery\\" column. Horowitz comments: \\"The Temple of Elemental Evil computer game is about as classic Dungeons & Dragons as you can get.\\" PC Gamers Desslock called it \\"a game by D&D; fans and for D&D; fans, and it provides all RPG fans with the opportunity to experience one of the genre’s classic adventures.\\" GameSpot's Greg Kasavin echoed those sentiments; it gave the game a 7.9 out of 10, calling the game \\"one of the most authentic PC Dungeons & Dragons experiences of the past few years.\\" Jamie Madigan of GameSpy gave the game four out of five stars, but he made note of a lack of multiplayer options. Tal Blevins of IGN gave it a 7.5, saying \\"ToEE isn't perfect, but it's certainly not a stinker.\\" GameZone gave an 8.4 out of 10, saying it \\"is a game that those who are serious about D&D-based; RPGs should have in their library.\\" John Breeden II of The Washington Post complimented the game's graphics, particularly the animated scenery, and also said that \\"[m]onsters appear suitably gruesome\\". According to GameSpy, \\"players who persevered were rewarded with an ultimately fun and satisfying experience – just not the mind-blowing one they had hoped for.\\" Adam Fleet of Computer Games Magazine wrote, \\"That this game is still recommendable in its current state is a testament to just how good this game could have been, as well as the barren state of the current RPG landscape in general.\\" The Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences nominated The Temple of Elemental Evil as its pick for 2003's best computer role-playing game, but ultimately gave the prize to Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. It was also a finalist in RPG Vault's special award categories for audio design and art direction that year. However, the game did receive Computer Games Magazines special \\"Raid™ Post- patch Recovery Award\\" and GameSpy's \\"Old School RPG Award\\" for 2003. The latter publication's editors wrote, \\"No game brought back memories of the old pen-and-paper Dungeons & Dragons days the way Temple of Elemental Evil did.\\" = Controversy = Upon its release, The Temple of Elemental Evil created a small stir due to the availability of the option for a male character to enter a same-sex marriage. In the town of Nulb, a pirate named Bertram begins flirting with male characters in the party and offers a lifetime of love and happiness in exchange for his freedom. This relationship was noted as another example of video games \\"pushing the boundaries\\" by The Guardian. Game developers and publishers generally did not object to the inclusion of a homosexual story option. Criticism of the relationship came primarily from gamers who felt that gay characters should not be included in video games. Industry observer Matthew D. Barton commented on the irony of so-called \\"geeky gamers\\", subject to stereotyping themselves, stereotyping gays in their opposition. Producer Tom Decker defended the move, saying in an interview with RPG Vault: \\"I particularly felt strongly that since we had several heterosexual marriages available in Hommlet, we should include at least one homosexual encounter in the game and not to make it a stereotyped, over the top situation, but on par with the other relationships available in the game\\". Bertram was named #6 on GayGamer.net's Top 20 Gayest Video Game Characters. Legacy As the release version of the game had many bugs, Troika released three patches which addressed some of the problems. After the closure of the developer and consequent end of official support, the game community took up the patching efforts with community-made patches and mods, providing many bugfixes, improvements, and new content. More recently, another improvement released in 2015, is a recreated game engine called 'Temple Plus', similar in functionality to OpenMW for Morrowind and built using Python, in allowing for increased flexibility and avoidance of legacy coding limitations and issues. The game was re-released by gog.com, a digital distributor, on October 13, 2010.Temple of Elemental Evil storms GoG on RPGamer.com (October 14, 2010) Ian Williams of Paste rated the game #6 on his list of \\"The 10 Greatest Dungeons and Dragons Videogames\\" in 2015.

It was established in 1985 with the support of AIPAC and the funding of many AIPAC donors, in order to provide higher quality research than AIPAC's publications. The institute's mission statement says that it seeks \\"to advance a balanced and realistic understanding of American interests in the Middle East and to promote the policies that secure them.\\" The institute was described in 2008 as \\"part of the core\\" of the Israel lobby in the United States, a charge that WINEP denies. Background WINEP was started in 1985 by founding chairwoman Barbi Weinberg of Los Angeles, CA. Martin Indyk, an Australian-trained academic and former deputy director of research for AIPAC, was the first executive director. Indyk described the think tank as \\"friendly to Israel but doing credible research on the Middle East in a realistic and balanced way.\\" The research was thus designed to be more independent and academic-quality. At the time it was founded, the institute focused research on Arab–Israeli relations, political and security issues, and overall U.S. Middle East policy. In the 1990s, prompted by the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Persian Gulf War, and changes in regional strategy, the institute expanded its research agenda to \\"focus on Turkey and the rise of Islamic politics.\\" It was during the Gulf War that the institute gained public recognition as a source for commentary and analysis. By 1992, it had a staff of 12–15 in-house research fellows, in addition to visiting scholars and support staff. Under Indyk's leadership, the institute gained notability as a center for the study and discussion of Middle East policy, and attracted Arab intellectuals to its events. Indyk would go on to serve in several U.S. diplomatic posts including U.S. ambassador to Israel, special envoy for Israeli–Palestinian negotiations, special assistant to President Clinton and senior director for Near East and South Asian affairs at the National Security Council and assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs. Indyk is currently vice president and director of the Foreign Policy Program at the Brookings Institution. In addition to ongoing research, the institute has striven to provide in-depth analysis at key inflection points in Middle East policy, such as during presidential election years. Beginning in 1988, the institute convened bipartisan Presidential Study Groups that have offered policy papers for incoming administrations of either party. The inaugural PSG document informed the policy of the George H. W. Bush administration toward the Middle East peace process. According to The New York Times, the institute has earned a reputation for solid scholarship, is committed to the peace process, and is supportive of Israel—a relationship with which it believes advances U.S. security interests. However, the institute does not identify as pro-Israel, saying the moniker \\"projects two false impressions—first, that the institute does not value American interests above special pleading for a foreign power and second, that the institute must be 'anti' others in the region (Palestinians, Arabs).\\" It adds: > This shorthand terminology perpetuates 'old thinking' that views the > Arab–Israeli conflict as the key dividing line in a region where the > division between moderates versus radicals is a more accurate prism through > which to understand local politics. On the personal level, this one- > dimensional description of the institute's quarter-century of research does > a disservice to the many current and former United States government > officials and military officers at the institute over the years as well as > the numerous institute scholars from Iran, Iraq, Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan, > Turkey, Morocco and other Middle Eastern countries over the years who have > undertaken impeccable research on a broad array of topics. The institute has come to be regarded as the preeminent think tank with a regional focus. It has made major contributions to the search for a peaceful resolution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. It produces research with policy assessments of current events, and its recommendations have been adopted by senior policymakers. It has a bipartisan agenda and board and is respected by both major political parties. It is closer ideologically to the Democratic Party; it generally opposes neoconservative policy. To underscore its commitment to U.S. policy, the institute only accepts donations from American citizens, foundations, corporations and institutions. In 2011, the institute devised a report entitled \\"Imagining the Border\\", which received much attention for drafting maps that sought to reconcile the Palestinian demand for sovereignty over the West Bank and the Israeli demand for control over most of the Jewish population there. The report drew heavily on statistical data, and proposed certain land swaps to ensure that a future Palestinian state would be viable and have quality land. The institute gave briefings to senior American, Israeli, and Palestinian government officials about the maps. In November 2017, the research organization created \\"Settlements and Solutions\\", which provides interactive maps detailing information about Israeli settlements over the Green Line. After the takeover of areas of Iraq by the Sunni militant group Daesh (ISIL) in 2014, The New York Times reported that Institute Lafer FellowFred S. Lafer was the third president of WINEP. (Fred Lafer, longtime Jewish leader, dies, May 1, 2013. Accessed 23 January 2015.) Michael Knights had alerted the U.S. National Security Council as early as 2012 to the rising level of insurgency among Iraq's Sunni minority. White House officials questioned his statistics and did not take action. The institute has been a forum for the discussion of key issues in U.S. policy toward Saudi Arabia. In May 2016, it hosted the former Saudi intelligence chief, Prince Turki bin Faisal al Saud, alongside IDF Maj. Gen. (res.) Yaakov Amidror, a former national security adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a rare joint public appearance. Two years later, Dr. Mohammad Al-Issa, secretary-general of the Muslim World League, addressed the institute and advocated a more moderate and tolerant Islam. Dissident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi participated in an institute forum in November 2016 in which he stated that Saudi Arabia should be \\"rightfully nervous about the Trump presidency,\\" according to The Economist.https://www.economist.com/open-future/2018/07/26/how-free- expression-is-suppressed-in-saudi-arabia The magazine reported that Saudi authorities asked Khashoggi to stop writing after the institute appearance but the journalist chose to live in exile instead. He was assassinated in Istanbul in 2018 while visiting the Saudi consulate. Activities The Washington Institute is considered an academic think tank (akin to the Brookings Institution and Public Policy Institute of California), staffed largely by researchers holding doctorate degrees and generally not having a mission affiliated with a particular ideology, as opposed to an advocacy think tank, which is staffed by individuals with strong ideological leanings. Academic think tanks focus on producing extensive research reports and books, whereas advocacy think tanks focus on marketing their ideas with condensed materials. Think tanks of all types typically also organize conferences, provide briefings to legislative committee staff, and testify as policy experts. The Washington Institute accesses the policy process from many angles: the written word, the spoken word, and personal contact. Institute experts research the region and brief officials in all branches of the U.S. government, both civilian and military. In addition to producing printed long-form monographs, the institute issues time-sensitive policy briefs which are distributed electronically by e-mail and social media. A Chicago Tribune editorial declared that institute-sponsored polls bring to light trends in popular thinking across the Middle East. While the institute frequently hosts off-the- record events with policymakers and scholars, its policy forums are public events featuring newsmakers and analysts that are attended by officials and journalists and are broadcast live on-line. The institute also holds an annual policy conference that convenes policymakers, journalists and diplomats in Washington, D.C., for in-depth discussion and debate on the key Middle East issues facing the United States. Institute scholars are public intellectuals who share their analysis frequently in major print and broadcast outlets. All institute output is available through its website in both English and Arabic. In addition to its permanent resident fellows—a group of experienced policymakers from government and academia—the institute also hosts visiting fellows from around the world. Visiting fellows include both young people beginning their foreign policy careers and veterans who take advantage of a year in Washington, D.C., to study the Middle East from an American vantage point. In cooperation with the Army, Navy, Air Force, and State Department, WINEP offers one-year fellowships that enable rising officers to immerse themselves in the geopolitics of the Middle East and the process of Washington policymaking. The institute also supports a program for research assistants and interns that provides foreign policy experience for undergraduates and recent college graduates. Several institute alumni now hold positions in the government, military, and academia internationally. The institute's Scholar- Statesman Award honors individuals \\"whose public service and professional achievements exemplify sound scholarship and a discerning knowledge of history.\\" Recipients have included former U.S. President Bill Clinton, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and former CIA directors Michael Hayden and George Tenet. =Current programs= The Washington Institute currently supports eight in-house research programs: * Beth and David Geduld Program on Arab Politics — focuses on social, political, and economic developments in the Arab world. * Project on the Middle East Peace Process — analysis on issues of critical concern to Israel and its Arab neighbors. * Bernstein Program on Gulf and Energy Policy — focuses on the conservative Arab States of the Persian Gulf and their role as a primary source of oil and natural gas. * Viterbi Program on Iran and U.S. Policy — analysis, private dialogue, public debate, and operational recommendations to address the challenges posed by Iran. * Military and Security Studies Program — issues that affect United States security interests. * Jeanette and Eli Reinhard Program on Counterterrorism and Intelligence — analysis of militant groups, their logistical and financial support networks, and counter-terrorism policy. * Fikra Forum — to stimulate debate and generate ideas for potential democracy in Arab countries * Turkish Research Program — discussion about Turkey's political, diplomatic, and strategic environment. Reception=Praise= In a 2014 study by the University of Pennsylvania's Lauder Institute of all think tanks worldwide, the Washington Institute was ranked 42nd on \\"Best Transdisciplinary Research Program at a Think Tank\\" and 42nd on \\"Think Tanks with Outstanding Policy- Oriented Public Programs\\". \\"You have for almost three decades been engaged in the extraordinarily important work of making ideas matter in some of the most vexing, critically important issues of our time. Ideas do matter, but they matter only if they are ideas that are tested by people who are willing to engage in civil discourse with those who might disagree, people, indeed, who search for the truth. That has been the reputation and the reality of the Institute since it was founded.\\" — former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice. \\"For nearly 30 years, the Washington Institute for Near East Policy has helped the United States government better understand and respond to big policy challenges focused in the Middle East.\\" — Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel =Criticism= The organization has been criticized for having strong ties to the pro-Israel lobbying group AIPAC and for being founded by a former AIPAC employee. In a December 2003 interview on Al Jazeera, Rashid Khalidi, a Palestinian-American professor and director of Columbia University's Middle East Institute, sharply criticized WINEP, stating that it is \\"the fiercest of the enemies of the Arabs and the Muslims\\", and describing it as the \\"most important Zionist propaganda tool in the United States.\\" In response, Martin Kramer, the editor of the Middle East Quarterly and a visiting fellow at WINEP, defended the group, saying that it is \\"run by Americans, and accepts funds only from American sources,\\" and that it was \\"outrageous\\" for Khalidi to denounce Arabs that visited WINEP as \\"blundering dupes.\\"\\"Columbia's Radical Caravan\\" by Martin Kramer, New York Sun, January 6, 2004. John Mearsheimer, a University of Chicago political science professor, and Stephen Walt, academic dean at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, describe it as \\"part of the core\\" of the pro-Israeli lobby in the United States. Discussing the group in their book, The Israel Lobby and US Foreign Policy, Mearsheimer and Walt write: > Although WINEP plays down its links to Israel and claims that it provides a > 'balanced and realistic' perspective on Middle East issues, this is not the > case. In fact, WINEP is funded and run by individuals who are deeply > committed to advancing Israel's agenda ... Many of its personnel are genuine > scholars or experienced former officials, but they are hardly neutral > observers on most Middle East issues and there is little diversity of views > within WINEP's ranks.\\" Notable current and former scholars Several current and former members of WINEP have served in senior positions in the administrations of presidents George H.W.

The romantic comedy series features 7th grader Ayu Tateishi, a tennis club member, and her transfer student friend, Nina Sakura, who is actually a trainee witch from the magical kingdom. It premiered in Shueisha's Ribon manga magazine in February 2001 and ran until January 2004. It was also published in five collected volumes by Shueisha. Viz Media licensed and released an English translation of the series in North America. The series was first adapted into a 20-minute anime OVA, released August 6, 2002. Later, it was also adapted into a 26-episode anime television series. Both were produced by Ashi Productions and Animax. The anime series premiered on May 20, 2003 in Japan on Animax, and was later licensed for Region 1 distribution by Geneon Entertainment. Plot Ayu Tateishi is a well-adjusted middle-schooler in her second year, until the fateful day when she finds a dejected looking Nina Sakura outside of the school. Nina explains that she lost something very dear to her earlier that day. And that she has fallen in love with her. Ayu offers to help Nina, the annoying girl look for her lost item, but Nina seems reluctant to say what the item is that she lost, and runs off. On her way home Ayu finds what seems to be a mini-computer underneath the bench she knew Nina to be at earlier that day. After returning the item to Nina, Nina struggles to decide whether to let Ayu in on the 'big secret' she keeps. In order to see if Ayu is trustworthy, she starts to follow Ayu around and eventually decides she can trust Ayu. Nina reveals that she is actually from the Magic Kingdom and is a magic girl. Ayu, however, doesn't believe Nina and thinks she is a bit crazy at first. Ayu herself had always shunned the ideas of magic and fairy tales, even admitting she had never read Harry Potter, so having someone tell her they are a witch truly isn't something she can easily accept. After several mishaps with her magic, Nina proves she is a magic girl, and a failure who came to Earth as her last chance to prove that she can get things right. These first mishaps and the fact that Nina has shared her secret with Ayu, Nina attaches herself to Ayu as a friend and does everything she can to help Ayu with getting the attention of her crush, Tetsushi Kaji. As their adventures continue many friends from the Magic Kingdom come and visit Nina to the chagrin of Ayu. The anime adaptation has a very different plot starting after Ayu and Nina have first met. Instead of coming as a witch failure who is trying to prove herself to be more than she is said to be, Nina has come to Earth to find the five \\"Holy Stones\\". She tells Ayu that whoever collects all five will qualify to marry the prince of the Magic Kingdom. Nina's childhood friend Maya is also on Earth from the start, competing with Nina to find the stones. Though Nina does collect them all first, she learns that the prince and Maya are truly in love with one another, so Nina gives up the stones and her dream, allowing Maya and the prince to be with one another, and Nina stays on Earth with her other lovers. Even though she still loves her. Characters ; : :Nina Sakura is a second female protagonist in the story Ultra Maniac. Her first scene is when Ayu Tateishi finds her crying because she lost a small, pink \\"box.\\" Later, when Ayu finds and returns to box to Nina Sakura, Nina realizes that she has found a perfect person to reveal her strange secret to. She later reveals it to Hiroki Tsujiai, who, in the manga, later becomes her boyfriend. In the anime, she is often seen trying to help Ayu with her love life. She'll do absolutely anything to ensure that her friends are happy, even if it means suffering a little grief herself. Nina is very peppy and perky, and she loves sweets. She also enjoys manga. In the anime, her real name is Nina Saqurail, and near the end, the last of the five holy stones are unleashed when she and Tsujiai reach to each other in the Dark Zone. ; : :Ayu is one of the female protagonists of the story. She constantly tries to stay calm and keep her cool about everything. This is quite a facade for her to keep up, because the only reason she wants to be \\"cool\\" is because Tetsushi Kaji (her crush, and later on her boyfriend) told her once that he liked how cool she was about everything. He said this because when their class was given a pop quiz she was the only one in the class who didn't freak out (she was actually just tired). However, after Ayu meets Nina, she is everything but cool and calm. She is the president of the girls' tennis club and one of the most popular girls in the school, and she works hard on keeping up her \\"cool, calm and collected\\" reputation. ; : :Considered an idol by the girls and a role model to the boys in his school, Tetsushi appears to be cool and always has a nice smile, but that's just his outer shell. In reality, Tetsushi is a normal person who doesn't even like being an idol. He only acts like \\"Prince Charming\\" because Ayu stated once that she liked him that way. (Ayu acted \\"cool\\" for the same reason.) He later explains to Nina that he's being \\"the nice guy\\" because of Ayu and that he worked hard for the title. Nina has a crush on Tetsushi during the second volume of the manga, but she forgets her original feelings for him when she sees how happy Ayu is to be with him. In both the manga and anime, he and Ayu eventually begin dating. ; : :Tetsushi's best friend, who is often seen together with him. He is the head of the boys' tennis club. He is a fan of many manga and has similar taste with Nina. He is very steadfast and has a good sense of self-worth. Hiroki is in love with Nina, and he and Nina start to go out with each other mid-way through the manga. They continue to date up to the end of the series. ; : :Yuta is from the Magic Kingdom, and he and Nina are childhood friends. He is adept enough with magic that he doesn't need a computer to cast spells like Nina does, and teases her about that frequently. He has a kind heart. At first, Yuta appears to show affection for Ayu, but, as Ayu later discovers, he is actually crazy about Nina. In the last episode of the anime, Yuta appears to have some feelings for Luna, but in the manga, he falls in love with Sayaka and goes out with her until the series ends. ; : :Nina's pet cat, Leo (called \\"Rio\\" in the English translation of the anime) can change into the form of a little boy by using a magic candy. In the anime, all he has to do is a flip and he becomes human. In the anime, he starts to like Ayu's dog, Tamako. ; : :One of the candidates to be the princess of the Magic Kingdom and Nina's childhood friend. Maya has a pet chameleon named and a talking crow named Shiro who wears an orange bandana. Her hobby is black magic. At the beginning of the story, Maya has a strong rivalry with Nina, but in episode 26, the rivalry ends. Maya has a crush on the prince, who loved her since the time when they danced together as children and she saved him. They later get married and Maya becomes princess of the Magic Kingdom. Her real name is Maya Orphelia. She does not appear in the manga, but in the epilogue chapter she is mentioned as Nina's roommate in Eltoria. ; :A beautiful girl at school who is known as an \\"ice doll\\" because she is frosty towards all of her classmates. She is interested in dating Yuta, but has a secret agenda. Sayaka is revealed to be half-witch on her deceased mother's side. She taught herself magic, and because she grew up on Earth, Yuta and Nina could not detect that Sayaka had magic powers. Due to bad experiences Sayaka had as a child after revealing her powers, she is envious of Nina who has so many magical and non- magical friends. Near the end, she admits her feelings for Yuta, and they get together for real. She is a manga-exclusive character. ; : :Another character exclusive to the anime. He is the Committee Chairman at Ayu and Nina's school. He wears eyeglasses and he always takes his red camera with him. The first time around, Jun accidentally sees Nina use magic. He instantly becomes determined to expose her as a witch and is constantly trying to take pictures of her. In time, he relents. After seeing Maya, he realizes that she became a wicked witch because of her dark magic. ; :A manga-only character, Yuta's older sister comes to school to teach and flirt with the teachers. She takes Nina and Ayu to bars and tends to get them in trouble. In the final chapter she is dating her crush. ;The Principal :A cheerful member of the school. ;, and :A trio of little girls also called the triplets loyal to Nina. Pine looks like Blossom from The Powerpuff Girls, but with a red dress, her matching eyes and short hair tied in pigtails. Bamboo is the only tomboy of the group. She wears a blue shirt with a white \\"B\\" on it and a green cap on her head. Plum is the only one to have blond hair wearing glasses. She also wears a purple dress and her pigtails are more elegant than Pine's. All three have the ability to ride on a blue stuffed dinosaur that can use its tail as a propeller.

In 2012 the U.S. Department of Defense assessed that the Taepodong-2 had not been deployed as a missile. The Taepodong-2 is the technology base for the Unha space launch vehicle, and was likely not intended as ICBM technology. Details As there is no publicly available imagery of the only Taepodong-2 launch in 2006, all estimates of technical parameters are approximate. Based on the size of the missile, the fuel composition, and the likely fuel capacity, it is estimated that a two- stage variant would have a range of around 4,000 km (2,500 statute miles) and a three-stage variant would be capable of reaching as far as 4,500 km (2,800 statute miles), giving it potentially the longest range in the North Korean missile arsenal. The burn time of each stage is a little over 100 seconds, thus allowing the missile to burn for 5 or 6 minutes. Speculative variants of the missile could be capable of a range of approximately 9,000 km (5,600 statute miles). At maximum range, the Taepodong-2 is estimated to have a payload capacity of less than 500 kg (~1,100 lbs). According to a former worker in the publications department of one of North Korea's top research centres, who defected to South Korea, North Korea began development of the missile in 1987. Very few details concerning the technical specifications of the rocket are public information; even the name \\"Taepodong-2\\" is a designation applied by agencies outside North Korea to what is presumed to be a successor to the Taepodong-1. The TD-2 first stage likely uses a liquid propellant (TM-185 fuel and AK-27I oxidizer) driven engine and the second stage likely utilises the Rodong short-range missile. Depending on the range, the estimated payload capacity could be as high as 700-1,000 kg (~1,550 - 2,200 lbs) at short range, making it potentially suitable for conventional weapons payloads, NBC payloads as well as Earth orbit satellite delivery. At maximum range, the Taepodong-2 is estimated to have a payload capacity of less than 500 kg (~1,100 lbs). North Korea has yet to demonstrate the ability to produce a re-entry vehicle, without which North Korea cannot deliver a weapon from an ICBM. In 2015, aerospace engineer and North Korea missile program analyst John Schilling stated that North Korea did not seem to be planning to create an operational ICBM from the Taepodong-2 technology, and that the Taepodong-2 had been mistakenly identified as an ICBM development, whereas in reality it was a space launch development vehicle. Structure=First stage= Taepodong-2's first stage consists of four Rodong motors. =Second and third stages= Little is known about the Taepodong-2 design beyond the first stage. Most likely the second stage is one of the Scud-derived North Korean ballistic missiles (either Rodong-1 or Hwasong-6), and the third stage most likely uses Chinese solid-fuel engines.Taepodong-2 specs, globalsecurity.org Launches=2006 test= A Taepodong-2 was test fired on 5 July 2006 from the Tonghae test facility. According to reports, the missile failed in mid-flight about 40 seconds after launch. =Subsequent Unha launches= Subsequent launches were intended to launch satellites, using a Taepodong-2 development called the Unha rocket. After two failures in April 2009 and April 2012, its first successful flight, Unha-3, occurred in December 2012 with the launch of the second version of Kwangmyŏngsŏng-3 satellite. This successful flight was repeated on 7 February 2016 (UTC) with the successful launch of Kwangmyŏngsŏng-4 using a similar rocket as Unha-3 even though the rocket is officially named as Kwangmyŏngsŏng (not to be confused with the satellite with the same name).

GIL governed Marbella beginning in 1991 on a platform of fighting petty crime and carrying out public ornamental works in the city. At the same time, Marbella was known as a refuge for British, Italian and Russian crime lords. After Gil was removed by a Spanish tribunal on charges of political corruption, Julián Muñoz, (also known for his romance with singer Isabel Pantoja), assumed the mayoralty of the city. He was later ousted by GIL members supporting Marisol Yagüe Reyes with the help of a turncoat Spanish Socialist Workers' Party councillor who had been a vocal critic of corruption. In March 2006, Yagüe and most of her administration were brought to trial on charges of corruption concerning their management of urban development and planning permissions in Marbella. In April 2006, the Spanish government initiated procedures to forcibly dissolve the council, an unprecedented movement in the history of recent Spanish democracy. GIL also established a strong presence in Estepona, Ceuta and Melilla. Gilismo (\\"gilism\\") has been identified as an italianized populism and as example of the berlusconization of Spanish politics, and along the political experiences of José María Ruiz Mateos and Mario Conde, as an example of protestary populism in Spain.

The name means \\"joyous\\". A sword identified as Joyeuse was used in French royal coronation ceremonies since the 13th century, and is now kept at the Louvre museum. In legend sheath at the Musée de Cluny in 2012. Some legends claim Joyeuse was forged to contain the Lance of Longinus within its pommel; others say the blade was smithed from the same materials as Roland's Durendal and Ogier's Curtana.Bullfinch's Mythology, Legends of Charlemagne, Chapter 24 The 11th century Song of Roland describes the sword: Some seven hundred years later, Bulfinch's Mythology described Charlemagne using Joyeuse to behead the Saracen commander Corsuble as well as to knight his comrade Ogier the Dane. The town of Joyeuse, in Ardèche, is supposedly named after the sword: Joyeuse was allegedly lost in a battle and retrieved by one of the knights of Charlemagne; to thank him, Charlemagne granted him an appanage named Joyeuse. Baligant, a general of the Saracens in The Song of Roland, named his sword Précieuse, in order not to seem inferior to Charlemagne. Coronation sword of the French kings Louis XIV with Joyeuse (Hyacinthe Rigaud, 1701) A sword identified with Charlemagne's Joyeuse was carried in front of the Coronation processionals for French kings, for the first time in 1270 (Philip III), and for the last time in 1824 (Charles X). The sword was kept in the Saint Denis Basilica since at least 1505, and it was moved to the Louvre in 1793. This Joyeuse as preserved today is a composite of various parts added over the centuries of use as coronation sword. But at the core, it consists of a medieval blade of Oakeshott type XII, mostly dated to about the 10th century. Martin Conway argued the blade might date to the early 9th century, opening the possibility that it was indeed the sword of Charlemagne, while Guy Laking dated it to the early 13th century. Some authors have even argued that the medieval blade may have been replaced by a modern replica in 1804 when the sword was prepared for the coronation of Napoleon Bonaparte. The Louvre's official website dates the pommel to the 10th to 11th centuries, the crossguard to the 12th and the scabbard to the 13th century.Coronation sword and scabbard of the Kings of France on the Official Website of the Louvre.

Edmond is largely credited with having introduced crack cocaine into the Washington, D.C. area during the crack epidemic, resulting in an escalating crime rate in the city which became known as the \\"murder capital of the United States\\". Criminal career Edmond was alleged to have moved large amounts of cocaine. In an indictment involving two of Edmond's associates, it was said that they bought between 1,000 and 2,000 kilos per week in 1992 from the Trujillo-Blanco brothers, who were associated with the Medellin cartel, and sold the drugs to Washington area wholesalers. He was known to have spent some $457,619 in an exclusive Georgetown store (Linea Pitti, specializing in Italian men's clothing) owned by Charles Wynn who was later convicted on 34 counts of money laundering. Edmond's estimated revenue was approximately $300 million annually. In one year, Edmond's organization, which employed 150 people, committed 30 murders. Remarking on Edmond, longtime D.C. mayor Marion Barry wrote in his autobiography: > He was a young, likable guy, good-looking, with a good personality, and a > lot of his friends he played basketball with had no idea that he was > involved in drug selling. He was basically pulled into it from his family, > That doesn't make it right, but Rayful had a lot of people who liked him and > were very loyal to him. The meeting with John Thompson Edmond was an avid fan of the Georgetown Hoyas, and frequently sat courtside with his entourage at the Capital Centre for home games. At the height of his empire, he became very friendly with several Hoyas players. When Georgetown University basketball coach (and D.C. native) John Thompson confirmed what was happening, he sent word through his sources to have Edmond meet him at his office at McDonough Gymnasium. When Edmond arrived, Thompson was initially cordial, and informed Edmond that he needed to cease all contacts with his players, specifically John Turner and Alonzo Mourning, both of whom had befriended Edmond. However, Thompson's parting words to Edmond were that Edmond would face serious consequences if he did not stay away from his players. It is believed that Thompson is the only person to stand up to Edmond without consequence, initially causing some shock and surprise that there was no reprisal against Thompson for it. Arrest, trial, and conviction Edmond was arrested on April 15, 1989 at the age of 24. His arrest and subsequent trial were widely covered by local and national media. Judicial officials, fearful of reprisals from members of Edmond's gang, imposed unprecedented security during the trial. Jurors' identities were kept secret before, during, and after trial, and their seating area was enclosed in bulletproof glass. The presiding judge even barred the public from the trial in an effort to protect the jury. Edmond was jailed at the maximum security facility at Marine Corps Base Quantico in Virginia and flown to the Federal Court House in Washington, D.C. by helicopter each day for his trial. Authorities took this unusual step due to heightened fears of an armed escape attempt. Edmond was convicted of numerous federal violations: (1) Engaging in a Continuing Criminal Enterprise, under 21 U.S.C. §§ 848(b), 853 (Count One); (2) Conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute more than 5 kilograms of cocaine and more than 50 grams of cocaine base, under 21 U.S.C. § 846 (Count Two); (3) Unlawfully employing a person under 18 years of age, under 21 U.S.C. § 845b (Count Five); (4) Interstate travel in aid of racketeering, under 18 U.S.C. § 1952(a) (Count Eleven); (5) Unlawful use of a communications facility, under 21 U.S.C. § 843(b) (Counts Fourteen, Fifteen, Sixteen, and Eighteen). On September 17, 1990, the District Court imposed sentences of mandatory life without parole on Count One, life without parole on Counts Two and Five, 60 months on Count Eleven, and 48 months on Counts Fourteen, Fifteen, Sixteen, and Eighteen. Edmond's sentences were to run concurrently. Edmond was eventually sentenced to life in prison without parole. His mother, Constance \\"Bootsie\\" Perry, was sentenced to 14 years in prison for participating in his criminal enterprise. Several of his sisters and cousins also received sentences. Edmond continued to deal after being incarcerated in the Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary, in Pennsylvania. He hooked up with Dixon Dario and Osvaldo \\"Chiqui\\" Trujillo-Blanco (son of Griselda \\"Godmother\\" Trujillo Blanco) who shared the same cell block with him. Edmond was setting up deals between D.C. area traffickers and his Colombian connection while incarcerated. In 1996, Edmond and another drug dealer from Atlanta, named Lowe, were convicted after conducting drug business from a federal prison phone. Edmond received an additional 30-year sentence. In an interview with the Bureau of Prisons, Edmond said he had spent several hours every day on the telephone, occasionally using two lines simultaneously to conduct his drug business. Attorney General Eric Holder criticized the Federal Bureau of Prisons for its lax management that allowed drug deals to be conducted from inside prison. In 1996, federal authorities revealed that Edmond had become a government informant. With Edmond's cooperation, the government arrested 11 alleged drug dealers working in Washington D.C. In exchange, federal prosecutors agreed to seek a reduced sentence for Edmond's mother. Edmond is still incarcerated but is now part of the United States Federal Witness Protection Program. The prison where he is held has not been disclosed by the government. In 2019, Edmond returned to D.C. for hearings on whether his life sentence should be reduced to time served based on the information he provided to authorities concerning 20 homicides. At the time, a survey by the District of Columbia Attorney General showed that half of D.C. residents thought Edmond should be released.

It is one of several specialist hospitals located within the Liverpool City Region alongside Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital, Alder Hey Children's Hospital, Liverpool Women's Hospital, Mersey Regional Burns and Plastic Surgery Unit and Clatterbridge Cancer Centre. The wards in the hospital are all named after pioneering neurosurgeons in the 20th and 21st century. It is managed by the Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust. History The Walton Centre originated from the Walton Centre for Neurology at Walton Hospital on Rice Lane in Walton, Liverpool. The Walton Centre originally provided services from the Walton Centre for Neurology at Walton Hospital on Rice Lane in Walton, Liverpool. However, as demand for services continued to increase, the capacity for provision at the relatively small Rice Lane site failed to keep pace and in 1998 all services were transferred to a new, purpose-built complex two miles north in Fazakerley adjacent to and adjoining Aintree University Hospital. The centre has subsequently continued to provide an expanding service to the public ever since. The centre achieved NHS Trust status in 1992, and gained NHS Foundation Trust status in 2009. In 2014 the Walton Centre became the first hospital in the UK to virtually open its doors to Google Street view to the main clinical areas. Services The Walton Centre is a specialist neurosciences NHS trust dedicated to providing comprehensive neurological, neurosurgical and pain management services. The majority of patients originate from Merseyside, Cheshire, North Wales, Lancashire and the Isle of Man, but for some specialist treatments of complex disorders the centre sees patients from all regions of the United Kingdom, referred by their general practitioner (GP) or other hospitals. The hospital does not have an accident and emergency department. However, alongside adjoining Aintree University Hospital, Walton acts as a designated major trauma centre and receives emergency transfers for those who have sustained neurological trauma in the region. Performance In 2006, the hospital was identified as \\"the most dangerous hospital in Merseyside and Cheshire for health workers\\". There were allegations, in February 2007, that a surgeon at the hospital removed brain tissue for research purposes without the patient's consent. The samples were used to test a new treatment for brain diseases on which the surgeon was joint owner of the patent. The hospital has been criticised for not offering treatments available in the United States. In 2015 it was named by the Health Service Journal as the second best acute specialist trust to work for. At that time it had 1,160 full-time equivalent staff and a sickness absence rate of 4.45%. 88% of staff recommend it as a place for treatment and 77% recommended it as a place to work. In November 2015 leaders at The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust were shortlisted for five separate awards. The Walton Center became the second specialist hospital in the UK to receive the top rating by the Care Quality Commission in October 2016. It retained the status following a Care Quality Commission inspection in August 2019.

A profound monarchist, he was a close friend and confidant of the heir to the throne of Spain, the Count of Barcelona, who he served as the Head of his Household from 1954 to 1993. Beltrán was born in Madrid to one of the great noble houses of Spain. At its peak, the House of Alburquerque held 18 titles in the peerage of Spain, 6 of which had the status of Grandee. His father, Miguel Osorio y Martos, 17th Duke of Alburquerque, was Gentilhombre Grandee of king Alfonso XIII while his mother was Inés Díez de Rivera y Figueroa, daughter of the Counts of Almodóvar, also Grandees of Spain. The closeness of the Dukes of Alburquerque to the kings of Spain had existed for many generations; the 8th, 15th and 16th duke had all been Mayordomos mayores or Heads of the Royal Household. Aspiring to become an engineer was soon frustrated by the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, which resulted in his enlistment in the cavalry of the nationalist faction, eventually becoming lieutenant colonel.Pepe Díaz, Deportistas Andaluces en los Juegos Olímpicos de la Era Moderna: Atenas 1896 a Turín 2006, Wanceulen (Sevilla, 2011), p. 180 His passion for equestrianism emerged after he was given his first pony age 5. On his 8th birthday, his father gifted him with a newsreel clip of the 1926 Grand National. He thereafter became enthusiastic with the idea of competing at the Grand National.Robin Oakley et al., Six Years of Jump Racing: From Arkle to McCoy, Bloomsbury (London, 2017), p. 24 The duke quickly became one of the promising horse riders of his home club, Puerta de Hierro, rising to prominence when he competed at the 1952 Summer Olympics and later at the 1960 Summer Olympics.Mariola Gómez Laínez, El Real Club de la Puerta de Hierro, Ediciones El Viso (Madrid, 2010), p. 56 His jockey career began when he came second in the Sussex Stakes at Lingfield Park. Despite the duke's unhelpful physique (he was as tall as a basketball player), he finally rode the Grand National as \\"gentleman rider\\" in 1952. Osorio also took part in 1963, 1965, 1966, 1973, when he already had 16 bone screws; in 1974, when he finished in a respectable 8th place; and finally at the remarkable age of 58 in 1976, breaking 7 ribs and vertebras, his right wrist and femur as well as suffering a severe concussion that gave him a two- day coma. As a result, the Jockey Club stewards declined to renew his riding permit and it was popularly said that should he continue, \\"the hospital would run out of screws and the duke out of legs\\". The Duke of Alburquerque continued riding in Europe until he was 65. He retired leaving behind an extremely popular legacy, particularly in Britain, where he is remembered for his \\"courageous and injury-defying performances\\" at Aintree in which he and his horse \\"Nereo\\" became fundamental.Tim Fitzgeorge-Parker, Steeplechase Jockeys: The Great Ones, Pelham Books (London, 1971), p. 82 On his death in 1994, a racing journalist described him as \\"an immensely popular character in British racing who cut the distinctive figure of being a tall, slender man with the nose and prominent chin of the traditional Spanish Grandee, closely resembling a Punch cartoon.\\"Tim Fitzgeorge-Parker, \\"Obituary: The Duke of Alburquerque\\" in The Independent, 10 February 1994 Jockey career Racing colours of the Duke of Alburquerque The duke became obsessed with winning Britain's Grand National Steeplechase horse race after watching a film of the race on his eighth birthday. However, each of his attempts ended in failure. On his first attempt in 1952, he fell from his horse, waking up later in hospital with a cracked vertebra. He tried to win again in 1963, and fell from his horse yet again. (Bookies placed a bet of 66-1 against him finishing still on the horse). He raced again in 1965, but again fell from his horse after it collapsed underneath him, breaking his leg. In 1974, after having sixteen screws removed from a leg he had broken after falling in another race, he also fell while training for the Grand National and broke his collarbone. He then competed in a plaster cast in the race, this time managing to finish, but only in eighth place. In 1976, the duke fell again during the race, this time being trampled by other horses. He suffered seven broken ribs, several broken vertebrae, a broken wrist, a broken thigh, and a severe concussion which left him in a coma for two days. At 57, the Iron Duke still tried to compete, but officials revoked his license for \\"his own safety\\". He never won the Grand National, but broke more bones than any other jockey in attempting to do so.

The financing can take the form of credits (financial support) or credit insurance and guarantees (pure cover) or both, depending on the mandate the ECA has been given by its government. ECAs can also offer credit or cover on their own account. This does not differ from normal banking activities. Some agencies are government-sponsored, others private, and others a combination of the two. ECAs currently finance or underwrite about US$430 billion of business activity abroad - about US$55 billion of which goes towards project finance in developing countries - and provide US$14 billion of insurance for new foreign direct investment, dwarfing all other official sources combined (such as the World Bank and Regional Development Banks, bilateral and multilateral aid, etc.). As a result of the claims against developing countries that have resulted from ECA transactions, ECAs hold over 25% of these developing countries' US$2.2 trillion debt. Export credit agencies use three methods to provide funds to an importing entity: * Direct Lending: This is the simplest structure whereby the loan is conditioned upon the purchase of goods or services from businesses in the organizing country. * Financial Intermediary Loans: Here, the export–import bank lends funds to a financial intermediary, such as a commercial bank, that in turn loans the funds to the importing entity. * Interest Rate Equalization: Under an interest rate equalization, a commercial lender provides a loan to the importing entity at below market interest rates, and in turn receives compensation from the export–import bank for the difference between the below- market rate and the commercial rate. Officially supported export credits Credits may be short term (up to two years), medium term (two to five years) or long term (five to ten years). They are usually supplier's credits, extended to the exporter, but they may be buyer's credits, extended to the importer. The risk on these credits, as well as on guarantees and insurance, is borne by the sponsoring government. ECAs limit this risk by being \\"closed\\" on risky countries, meaning that they do not accept any risk on these countries. In addition, a committee of government and ECA officials will review large and otherwise riskier than normal transactions. Tied aid credits Officially supported export credit may be connected to official development assistance (ODA) in two ways. First, they may be mixed with ODA, while still financing the same project (mixed credit). As the export credit is tied to purchases in the issuing country, the whole package qualifies as a tied aid credit, even if the ODA part is untied aid. Second, tied aid credits are not very different from export credits, except in interest, grace period (the time when there is no repayment of the principal) and terms of repayment. Such credits are separated from export credit by an OECD requirement that they have a minimum degree of \\"softness\\". \\"Softness\\" is measured by a formula that compares the present value of the credit with the present value of the same amount at standardized \\"commercial\\" terms. This difference is expressed as a percentage of the credit and called \\"concessionality level\\". Thus a grant has a concessionality level of 100%, a commercial credit scores zero per cent. The higher the concessionality level, the more the tied aid credit looks like ODA, the lower, the more it looks like an export credit. Partially untied credits consist of a tied and an untied part. The latter is usually intended to finance \\"local cost\\", investment cost to be made in the importing country. This part may also be in a local currency. Partially untied aid is treated as tied aid. International regulation Both officially supported export credits and tied aid credit and grants are extended on terms bound by the OECD's arrangement on official export credits. The Arrangement is a \\"Gentlemen's Agreement\\" amongst its Participants who represent most OECD Member Governments. The Arrangement sets forth the most generous export credit terms and conditions that may be supported by its Participants. The main purpose of Arrangement is to provide a framework for the orderly use of officially supported export credits. In practice, this means providing for a level playing field (whereby competition is based on the price and quality of the exported goods and not the financial terms provided) and working to eliminate subsidies and trade distortions related to officially supported export credits. http://www.oecd.org/tad/xcred/arrangement.htm Since 1999, country risk categories have been harmonized by the Arrangement and minimum premium rates have been allocated to the various risk categories. This is intended to ensure that competition takes place via pricing and the quality of the goods exported, and not in terms of how much support a state provides for its exporters. The Arrangement does not extend to exports of agricultural commodities or military equipment. A recent decision at the World Trade Organization (WTO) indicates that the use of officially supported export credits in agriculture is bound by WTO members' commitments with respect to subsidised agricultural exports (see the WTO Appellate Body decision on the Brazil-US cotton case as it relates to the General Sales Manager (GSM) 102 and 103 programs and other US agricultural export credits, summarized here). At EU level, the European Commission, in particular the Directorate General for Trade, plays a role in the harmonization of Export Credit Agencies and the co- ordination of policy statements and negotiation positions. This is based on council decisions 73/391/EEC and 76/641/EEC. These decisions provide for prior consultations among member states on long term export credits. Member states may ask each other if they are considering to finance a specific transaction with official export credit support. EU members may not subsidize intra-EU export credits. The application of the OECD arrangement in providing export credit is mandatory in EU countries under Art. 1 of Regulation (EU) No. 1233/2011.(EU) No. 1233/2011 The Berne Union, or officially, the International Union of Credit & Investment Insurers, is an international organisation for the export credit and investment insurance industry. The Berne Union and Prague Club combined have more than 70 member companies spanning the globe. Its membership includes both commercial and state-sponsored insurers. Support and Criticism Some observers view state-sponsored export credits as nothing more than export subsidies by a different name. As such, the activities of ECAs are considered by some to be a type of corporate welfare. Others argue that ECAs create debt in poor countries motivated not by development goals but to support rich countries' industry. In addition, ECAs may soak up aid money as debt relief programs predominantly relieve poor countries from debt owed to donor countries' ECAs. ECAs are also criticised for insuring companies against political actions that aim to protect workers' rights, other human rights, or the natural environment in the countries in which the investment is being made. Advocates of ECAs assert that export credits allow impoverished importers to purchase needed goods that would otherwise be unaffordable; export credits are components of a broader strategy of trade policies; and government involvement can achieve results that the private sector cannot, such as applying greater pressure on a recalcitrant borrower. These arguments for and against export credits are not new and have been studied at length in academic literature. For a good general discussion, see Baron, David P.

It is distinguished from linguistic performance, which is the way a language system is used in communication. Noam Chomsky introduced this concept in his elaboration of generative grammar,Chomsky, Noam. (1965). Aspects of the Theory of Syntax. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. where it has been widely adopted and competence is the only level of language that is studied. According to Chomsky, competence is the ideal language system that enables speakers to produce and understand an infinite numberIn his use of \\"infinite number\\", Chomsky assumed no upper bound for the length of a sentence.

According to him, competence is the ideal speaker-hearer's knowledge of his or her language and it is the 'mental reality' which is responsible for all those aspects of language use which can be characterized as 'linguistic'.Kroy, Moshe. (1974). The Conscience, A Structural Theory. Israel: Keterpress Enterprise Chomsky argues that only under an idealized situation whereby the speaker-hearer is unaffected by grammatically irrelevant conditions such as memory limitations and distractions will performance be a direct reflection of competence. A sample of natural speech consisting of numerous false starts and other deviations will not provide such data. Therefore, he claims that a fundamental distinction has to be made between the competence and performance. Chomsky dismissed criticisms of delimiting the study of performance in favor of the study of underlying competence, as unwarranted and completely misdirected. He claims that the descriptivist limitation-in-principle to classifying and organizing data, the practice of \\"extracting patterns\\" from a corpus of observed speech, and the describing of \\"speech habits\\" are core factors precluding the development of a theory of actual performance. =Other generativists= Linguistic competence is treated as a more comprehensive term for lexicalists, such as Jackendoff and Pustejovsky, within the generative school of thought. They assume a modular lexicon, a set of lexical entries containing semantic, syntactic and phonological information deemed necessary to parse a sentence.Jackendoff, R. 1997. The architecture of the language faculty. Cambridge (Massachusetts): The MIT Press.Pustejovsky, J. 1998a. The generative lexicon. Cambridge (Massachusetts) & London (England): The MIT Press. In the generative lexicalist view this information is intimately tied up with linguistic competence. Nevertheless, their models are still in line with the mainstream generative research in adhering to strong innateness, modularity and autonomy of syntax.Paridis, Carita. (2003) Annual Review of Cognitive Linguistics 1. (pp 207-231). John Benjamins Publishing Company. Ray S. Jackendoff Ray S. Jackendoff's model deviates from the traditional generative grammar in that it does not treat syntax as the main generative component from which meaning and phonology is developed unlike Chomsky. According to him, a generative grammar consists of five major components: the lexicon, the base component, the transformational component, the phonological component and the semantic component.The Five Major Components of the Generative Grammar * The lexicon contains a list of the formatives of the language and their syntactic, phonological and the semantic properties. It also contains a set of redundancy rules which express morphological and semantic relationships among lexical items. * The base component contains a context-free phrase structure grammar, consisting of a set of unordered rules which collectively expand the symbol S into phrase markers whose preterminal strings are lexical category symbols. The base also contains a set of lexical insertion rules, which freely insert lexical items by category into the preterminal strings to form deep structure. * The transformational component consists of a set of transformations which collectively map deep structures. * The phonological component maps surface structures into phonetic representations, as proposed in Chomsky and Halle(1968). * The semantic component consists of at least four subcomponents: functional structure, modal structure, coreference relations and focus and presupposition.Jackendoff, Ray S.(1972).Semantic Interpretation in Generative Grammar.The MIT Press Classics. Against the syntax-centered view of generative grammar(syntactocentrism), he specifically treats phonology, syntax and semantics as three parallel generative processes, coordinated through interface processes. He further subdivides each of those three processes into various \\"tiers\\", themselves coordinated by interfaces. Yet, he clarifies that those interfaces are not sensitive to every aspect of the processes they coordinate. For instance, phonology is affected by some aspects of syntax, but not vice versa. James Pustejovsky In contrast to the static view of word meaning (where each word is characterized by a predetermined number of word senses) which imposes a tremendous bottleneck on the performance capability of any natural language processing system, Pustejovsky proposes that the lexicon becomes an active and central component in the linguistic description. The essence of his theory is that the lexicon functions generatively, first by providing a rich and expressive vocabulary for characterizing lexical information; then, by developing a framework for manipulating fine-grained distinctions in word descriptions; and finally, by formalizing a set of mechanisms for specialized composition of aspects of such descriptions of words, as they occur in context, extended and novel sense are generated.Pustejovsky, James. (1995). The Generative Lexicon. The MIT Press Cambridge, Massachusetts, London, England. Katz & Fodor Katz and Fodor suggests that a grammar should be thought of as a system of rules relating the externalized form of the sentences of a language to their meanings that are to be expressed in a universal semantic representation, just as sounds are expressed in a universal semantic representation. They hope that by making semantics an explicit part of generative grammar, more incisive studies of meaning would be possible. Since they assume that semantic representations are not formally similar to syntactic structure, they suggest a complete linguistic description must therefore include a new set of rules, a semantic component, to relate meanings to syntactic and/or phonological structure. Their theory can be reflected by their slogan \\"linguistic description minus grammar equals semantics\\".A.Fodor, Jerry. and J.Katz,Jerrold.(1964).The Structure of Language, Readings in the Philosophy of Language. Prentice-Hall, Inc. Critiques A broad front of linguists have critiqued the notion of linguistic competence, often severely. Functionalists, who argue for a usage-based approach to linguistics, argue that linguistic competence is derived from and informed by language use, performance, taking the directly opposite view to the generative model.Newmeyer, Frederick. 2001. \\"The Prague School and North American functionalist approaches to syntax\\" Journal of Linguistics 37, pp. 101-126.\\"Since most American functionalists adhere to this trend, I will refer to it and its practitioners with the initials \`USF'. Some of the more prominent USFs are Joan Bybee, William Croft, Talmy Givon, John Haiman, Paul Hopper, Marianne Mithun and Sandra Thompson. In its most extreme form (Hopper 1987, 1988), USF rejects the Saussurean dichotomies such as langue vs. parôle. For early interpretivist approaches to focus, see Chomsky (1971) and Jackendoff (1972). parole and synchrony vs. diachrony. All adherents of this tendency feel that the Chomskyan advocacy of a sharp distinction between competence and performance is at best unproductive and obscurantist; at worst theoretically unmotivated. \\"Bybee, Joan. \\"Usage- based phonology.\\" p. 213 in Darnel, Mike (ed). 1999. Functionalism and Formalism in Linguistics: General papers. John Benjamins Publishing Company As a result, in functionalist theories emphasis is placed on experimental methods to understand the linguistic competence of individuals. Sociolinguists have argued that the competence/performance distinction basically serves to privilege data from certain linguistic genres and socio-linguistic registers as used by the prestige group, while discounting evidence from low-prestige genres and registers as being simply mis-performance.Noonan, Michael. \\"Non- Structuralist Syntax\\" p. 21. in Darnel, Mike (ed). 1999. Functionalism and Formalism in Linguistics: General papers. John Benjamins Publishing Company Noted linguist John Lyons, who works on semantics, has said: : Chomsky's use of the term performance to cover everything that does not fall within the scope of a deliberately idealized and theoretically restricted concept of linguistic competence, was perhaps unfortunate. Lyons, John : Semantics: v.2, Cambridge University Press, 1977, p.568 Dell Hymes, quoting Lyons as above, says that \\"probably now there is widespread agreement\\" with the above statement. in Martin Pütz (ed), Thirty Years of Linguistic Evolution (1992), p.41 Many linguists including M.A.K. Halliday and Labov have argued that the competence/performance distinction makes it difficult to explain language change and grammaticalization, which can be viewed as changes in performance rather than competence.see e.g. Haspelmath, Martin. \\"Why is grammaticalization irreversible?\\" Linguistics 37–6 (1999), 1043–1068 Another critique of the concept of linguistic competence is that it does not fit the data from actual usage where the felicity of an utterance often depends largely on the communicative context.see e.g. Coseriu, Eugenio. 1985. \\"Linguistic Competence: What Is It Really?

Neurolinguist Harold Goodglass has argued that performance and competence are intertwined in the mind, since, \\"like storage and retrieval, they are inextricably linked in brain damage.\\"Charles Fillmore etal, Individual Differences in Language Ability and Language Behavior, 2014, p. 188 Cognitive Linguistics is a loose collection of systems that gives more weightage to semantics, and considers all usage phenomenon including metaphor and language change.

Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press =Critique in psycholinguistics= Numerous experiments on infants in the last two decades have shown that they are able to segment words (frequently co-occurring sound sequences) from other sounds in a stream of meaningless syllables.Saffran, Newport, and Aslin, (1996). Statistical learning by 8-month-old infants. Science, 274, 1926–1928. This together with computational results that recurrent neural networks can learn syntax-like patterns,Elman, J. L. (1991). Distributed representations, simple recurrent networks, and grammatical structure. Machine Learning, 7, 195–224. resulted in a wide questioning of nativist assumptions underlying psycholinguistic work up to the nineties.Seidenberg, M. S. (1997). Language acquisition and use: Learning and applying probabilistic constraints. Science, 275(5306), 1599–1603. According to experimental linguist N.S. Sutherland, the task of psycholinguistics is not to confirm Chomsky's account of linguistic competence by undertaking experiments. It is by doing experiments, to find out what are the mechanisms that underlie linguistic competence.Sutherland, N.S. (1966) Comments on the Fodor and Garrett paper. In Lyons and Wales (eds.) 1966. (pp 161-162). Psycholinguistics generally reject the distinction between performance and competence.Newmeyer, Frederick. 2003. Grammar is grammar and usage is usage. Language. 79:682–707 Psycholinguists have also decried the competence- performance distinction on the ability to model dialogue: : Dialogue sits ill with the competence/performance distinction assumed by most generative linguistics (Chomsky, 1965), because it is hard to determine whether a particular utterance is \\"well-formed\\" or not (or even whether that notion is relevant to dialogue). Dialogue is inherently interactive and contextualized.Alan Garnham, Simon Garrod, and Anthony Sanford, Handbook of psycholinguistics, Elsevier, 2006, p.9 =Pragmatics and communicative competence= The narrow definition of competence espoused by generativists resulted in the field of pragmatics where concerns other than language have become dominant. This has resulted in a more inclusive notion called communicative competence, to include social aspects – as proposed by Dell Hymes.Hymes, Dell. (2000 [1965]) On communicative competence. In Alessandro Duranti (ed) Linguistic Anthropology: A Reader (pp 53-73). Malden, MA: Blackwell.Hymes, Dell. 1971. Competence and performance in linguistic theory. Language acquisition: Models and methods (1971), pp. 3-28. This situation has had some unfortunate side effects: :Having grown up in opposition to linguistics, pragmatics has largely dispensed with grammar; what theoretical input it has had has been drawn from strands in philosophy and sociology rather than linguistics. [But this is a] split between two aspects of what to me is a single enterprise: that of trying to explain language. It seems to me that both parts of the project are weakened when they are divorced one from the other.M.A.K. Halliday, \\"On Grammar\\", Continuum Publishing, 2005, p.10 The major criticism towards Chomsky's notion of linguistic competence by Hymes is the inadequate distinction of competence and performance. Furthermore, he commented that it is unreal and that no significant progress in linguistics is possible without studying forms along with the ways in which they are used. As such, linguistic competence should fall under the domain of communicative competence since it comprises four competence areas, namely, linguistic, sociolinguistic, discourse and strategic.Retrieved on November 17, 2010 Related areas of study Linguistic competence is commonly used and discussed in many language acquisition studies. Some of the more common ones are in the language acquisition of children, aphasics and multilinguals. =Child language= The Chomskyan view of language acquisition argues that humans have an innate ability – universal grammar – to acquire language. Retrieved on November 17, 2010 However, a list of universal aspects underlying all languages has been hard to identify. Another view, held by scientists specializing in Language acquisition, such as Tomasello, argues that young children's early language is concrete and item-based which implies that their speech is based on the lexical items known to them from the environment and the language of their caretakers. In addition, children do not produce creative utterances about past experiences and future expectations because they have not had enough exposure to their target language to do so. Thus, this indicates that the exposure to language plays more of a role in a child's linguistic competence than just their innate abilities.Tomasello, Michael. (2000). Cognition 74. (pp 209-253). Elseiver Science B.V. Retrieved on November 17, 2010 =Aphasia= Aphasia refers to a family of clinically diverse disorders that affect the ability to communicate by oral or written language, or both, following brain damage.Goodglass, Harold. (1993). Understanding Aphasia. Academic Press, inc. In aphasia, the inherent neurological damage is frequently assumed to be a loss of implicit linguistic competence that has damaged or wiped out neural centers or pathways that are necessary for maintenance of the language rules and representations needed to communicate. The measurement of implicit language competence, although apparently necessary and satisfying for theoretic linguistics, is complexly interwoven with performance factors. Transience, stimulability, and variability in aphasia language use provide evidence for an access deficit model that supports performance loss.LaPointe, Leonard L. (2008).Linguistic Competence in Aphasia LaPointe Perspectives on Augmentative and Alternative Communication. 17: 87-92. =Multilingualism= The definition of a multilingualThe term multilingual is also commonly used to refer to a bilingual. is one that has not always been very clear-cut. In defining a multilingual, the pronunciation, morphology and syntax used by the speaker in the language are key criteria used in the assessment. Sometimes the mastery of the vocabulary is also taken into consideration but it is not the most important criteria as one can acquire the lexicon in the language without knowing the proper use of it. When discussing the linguistic competence of a multilingual, both communicative competence and grammatical competence are often taken into consideration as it is imperative for a speaker to have the knowledge to use language correctly and accurately. To test for grammatical competence in a speaker, grammaticality judgments of utterances are often used. Communicative competence on the other hand, is assessed through the use of appropriate utterances in different setting.Myers-Scotton, Carol. (2006). Multiple Voices : an introduction to bilingualism . Australia: Blackwell Publishing. =Understanding humour= Language is often implicated in humor. For example, the structural ambiguity of sentences is a key source for jokes. Take Groucho Marx's line from Animal Crackers: \\"One morning I shot an elephant in my pyjamas; how he got into my pyjamas I'll never know.\\" The joke is funny because the main sentence could theoretically mean either that (1) the speaker, while wearing pajamas, shot an elephant or (2) the speaker shot an elephant that was inside his pyjamas. Retrieved on November 17, 2010 Propositions by linguists such as Victor Raskin and Salvatore Attardo have been made stating that there are certain linguistic mechanisms (part of our linguistic competence) underlying our ability to understand humor and determine if something was meant to be a joke. Raskin puts forth a formal semantic theory of humor, which is now widely known as the semantic script theory of humor (SSTH). The semantic theory of humour is designed to model the native speaker's intuition with regard to humor or, in other words, his humor competence. The theory models and thus defines the concept of funniness and is formulated for an ideal speaker-hearer community i.e. for people whose senses of humor are exactly identical. Raskin's semantic theory of humor consists of two components – the set of all scripts available to speakers and a set of combinatorial rules. The term \\"script\\" used by Raskin in his semantic theory is used to refer to the lexical meaning of a word. The function of the combinatorial rules is then to combine all possible meaning of the scripts. Hence, Raskin posits that these are the two components which allows us to interpret humor.Raskins, Victor. (1985). Semantic mechanisms of humor. D. Reidel Publishing Company.

History Hardin–Simmons University was founded as Abilene Baptist College in 1891 by the Sweetwater Baptist Association and a group of cattlemen and pastors who sought to bring Christian higher education to the Southwest. The purpose of the school would be \\"to lead students to Christ, teach them of Christ, and train them for Christ.\\" The original land was donated to the university by rancher C.W. Merchant. It was the first school of higher education established in Texas west of Fort Worth. The school was renamed Simmons College in 1892 in honor of an early contributor, James B. Simmons. By 1907 it claimed an enrollment of 524 and a staff of 49. In 1925, it became Simmons University. It was renamed Hardin–Simmons University in 1934 in honor of Mary and John G. Hardin, who were also major contributors.Handbook of Texas Online, s.v. \\"Hardin-Simmons University\\" (accessed January 8, 2007). The university has been associated with the Baptist General Convention of Texas since 1941. The university publicly experienced financial challenges in the late 2010s continuing into 2020 as the state and the Baptist General Convention of Texas reduced the funding levels of programs in which the university participates. In 2018, the university ended 9 undergraduate and 4 graduate programs and closed 5 campus extensions (Logsdon Seminary campuses in Coppell, Lubbock, Corpus Christi and McAllen; Acton MBA Program in Austin). These changes also included terminations of staff and faculty. Two years later, in 2020, the university announced that it would close Logsdon Seminary and end an additional 22 academic programs with accompanying terminations of staff and faculty. =Presidents= * 1892–1894 Rev.

Pre-professional programs include dentistry, engineering, medicine, law, pharmacology, physical therapy, and seminary. HSU offers courses in geography, Greek, Hebrew, humanities, and physical sciences, as well. The university offers a doctorate in physical therapy, the first in Texas which is open to private citizens, as well as Doctor of Education, Doctor of Ministry and a Doctor of Science degrees. HSU students come from diverse backgrounds and a variety of Christian denominations. With an approximate enrollment of 2,500 students, the student- to-teacher ratio is 12:1. =Rankings= In 2016, U.S. News & World Report ranked Hardin-Simmons 33 among Regional Universities in the West. That same year, Princeton Review included the university among its Best Western Colleges. Campus life HSU's Student Activities host an event on campus almost every week of the semester, including concerts, movie nights, dances, game nights, pool parties, SMORES cookouts, volleyball tournaments, and much more. The basement of the Student Center is a place for students to hang out and relax. It is complete with giant flat-screen TVs, cutting-edge gaming systems, bowling, pool, and ping-pong, all which can be used for free. Hardin–Simmons offers numerous opportunities to get involved: All-School SING, Campus Recreations, Greek Life, Six White Horses, Student Congress, Student Activities, International Club, International Student Fellowship, The Brand, The Bronco, intramurals and recreational sports, various academic clubs, the World Famous Cowboy Band, Spurs Dance Team, and HSU Cheerleaders. Opportunities also exist for students to minister to each other and to the extended Christian community at HSU. Chapel services are held weekly for the entire student body. Neighborhood outreach programs are also available in which students can participate. Baptist Student Ministries (BSM) offers free noon lunches for students every Wednesday. The BSM provides possibilities for students to get involved in Bible study groups and go on mission trips, in addition to hosting concerts and other campus events. Campus resources include career services, a writing center, academic advisors, library services, faculty mentors, disability services, health services, peer mentors, and counseling. HSU’s grounds include six residence halls and three apartment complexes. Campus infrastructure is built in classic brick architecture, and the school’s golden-domed, red brick clock tower serves as its signature building, along with the 30 by 41-ft stained glass wall of Logsdon chapel, on the campus' southeast corner. HSU was named one of the 50 Most Beautiful Christian Colleges and Universities in 2017. =Western Heritage Day= Western Heritage Day is an annual celebration of the heritage and way of life in the American frontier that has occurred since the Abilene Centennial Celebration in 1981. The event is held on the HSU campus and includes activities such as trick roping, pit branding, chuck wagon snacks, and a small farm animal petting area. The activities have become a fun educational opportunity for Abilene-area elementary school-aged children.Timothy Chipp, \\"HSU goes back in time for 35th Western Heritage Day\\", Abilene Reporter News, April 20, 2017 Athletics Hardin–Simmons was a member of the Border Intercollegiate Athletic Association from 1941 to 1961, during which time the football team won three conference championships. For the first 15 years after HSU restarted its football program (1990–2005), the Hardin–Simmons Cowboy football team had the best winning percentage (77.4%) of all Texan college football programs. HSU athletics now plays in the American Southwest Conference, and had won 75 conference titles, the most of any school. Hardin–Simmons is a Division III school and offers 18 varsity sports for men and women, including: football, volleyball, baseball, softball, soccer (men/women), tennis (men/women), basketball (men/women), cross country (men/women), track (men/women), and golf (men/women). Women's soccer has been HSU's single-most successful athletic program with 22 ASC Conference Championships in the 1996-2019 period, and an NCAA Division III National Championship title in 2010.

Biography By profession an advocate of the high court, he also took a vigorous share in literary, social, municipal and political work, as well as in the affairs of the University of Bombay, over which he presided as vice-chancellor from 1892 until his death. At the age of five Telang was sent to the Amarchaud Wadi vernacular school, and in 1859 entered the high school in Bombay which bears the name of Mountstuart Elphinstone. Here he came under the influence of Narayan Mahadev Purmanand, a teacher of fine intellect and force of character, afterwards one of Telang's most intimate friends. From this school he passed to the Elphinstone College, of which he became a fellow, and after taking the degree of M.A. and LL.B., decided to follow the example of Bal Mangesh Wagle, the first Indian admitted by the judges to practise on the original side of the high court, a position more like the status of a barrister than a vakil or pleader. He passed the examination and was enrolled in 1872. His learning and other gifts soon brought him an extensive practice. He had complete command of the English language, and his intimacy with Sanskrit enabled him to study and quote the Hindu law-books with an ease not readily attained by European counsel. Telang, finding his career assured, declined an offer of official employment. But in 1889 he accepted a seat on the high court bench, where his judgments are recognized as authoritative, especially on the Hindu law. He was syndic of the university from 1881, and vice-chancellor from 1892 until his death. In that year also he was elected President of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society. These two offices had never been held by a native of India before. The decoration of C.I.E. conferred on him in the 1884 Birthday Honours was a recognition of his services as a member of a mixed commission appointed by the government to deal with the educational system of the whole of India. He was nominated to the Bombay legislative council in 1884, but declined a similar position on the viceroy's council. He was the first secretary of the Indian National Congress. Along with Pherozshah Mehta, he was the originator of the Bombay Presidency Association. As a student he had won the Bhugwandas scholarship in Sanskrit, and in this language his later studies were profound. His translation of the Bhagavad Gita into English prose and verse is a standard work, and available in Max Müller's monumental compilation, the Sacred Books of the East, vol. 8, as the Bhagavadgita With the Sanatsugâtiya and the Anugitâ (published 1882). Also notable is his publication, in 1884, of the historical Sanskrit play, Mudrarakshasa of Vishakhadatta under the auspices of the Education Department and the Government Central Book Depot, Bombay. He criticized Albrecht Weber's hypothesis that the story of the Ramayana was influenced by the Homeric epics. While devoted to the sacred classics of the Hindus, Telang did not neglect his own vernacular, Marathi literature being enriched by his translation of Lessing's Nathan the Wise, and an essay on Social Compromise.

The original use of the term All-America seems to have been to the 1889 College Football All-America Team selected by Caspar Whitney and published in This Week's Sports.The All-America Team for 1889 selected by Casper Whitney is identified in the NCAA guide to football award winners Football pioneer Walter Camp also began selecting All-America teams in the 1890s and was recognized as the official selector in the early years of the 20th century. NCAA recognition As of 2009, the College Football All-America Team is composed of the following College Football All-American first teams: Associated Press (AP), Football Writers Association of America (FWAA), American Football Coaches Association (AFCA), Walter Camp Foundation (WCFF), The Sporting News (TSN), Sports Illustrated (SI), Pro Football Weekly (PFW), ESPN, CBS Sports (CBS), College Football News (CFN), ProFootballFocus (PFF), Rivals.com, and Scout.com. =Consensus All-Americans= Starting in 2009, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) recognizes the All-America teams selected by the AP, AFCA, FWAA, Sporting News, and the WCFF to determine consensus All- Americans. If more than half of the organizations select a player to their first team, he receives the \\"consensus\\" honor. If no player qualifies under that criterion, a player named to two first teams can be chosen. Second- and third-team selections can be used as tie-breakers. If still tied, each player is listed. If a player is named an All-American by all five organizations, he receives \\"unanimous All-American\\" recognition. Depending upon the distribution of first team honors at any given position, it is possible to be consensus with fewer than three first-team selections. As of 2018, the University of Oklahoma had produced the most unanimous All-Americans of any program with 35. =Individual All-Americans= There have been 2,868 players from 156 colleges and universities since 1889 who were selected to at least one All-American first team. Only four players have earned that honor four times:NCAA Football Media Guide, 2008, pp. 161, 171 They are: *Marshall Newell, Tackle, 1890, 1891, 1892, 1893 Harvard *Frank Hinkey, End, 1891, 1892, 1893, 1894 Yale *Gordon Brown, Guard, 1897, 1898, 1899, 1900 Yale *T.

The Selection Process is an All-America Selection Committee is made up of three head coaches from each of the AFCA's nine I-A (Bowl Division) districts, one of whom serves as a district chairman, along with another head coach who serves as the chairman of the selection committee. The coaches in each district are responsible for ranking the top players in their respective districts; that information, along with ballots submitted by FBS head coaches, are used to select the AFCA FBS Coaches’ All-America Team. The Coaches’ All- America Team has been sponsored by various entities throughout the years but it is now under its own banner, the AFCA. These are the sponsors/publishers of the team throughout the years. 1945–1947: Published in Saturday Evening Post 1948–1956: Published in Collier's 1957–1959: General Mills 1960–1993: Eastman Kodak 1994: Schooner's International 1995–1996: AFCA 1997–1999: Burger King 2000–present: AFCA =FWAA= The Football Writers Association of America (FWAA) Team, the second longest continuously published team in college football, has been a staple of the college football scene since 1944. It is sometimes referred to as the \\"Writers' All-America Team\\". The FWAA has selected an All-America team with the help of its members and an All-America Committee which represents all the regions in the country. Some who have helped to select this team over the years: Mark Blaudschun, Grantland Rice, Bert McGrane, Blackie Sherrod, Furman Bisher, Pat Harmon, Fred Russell, Edwin Pope, Murray Olderman, Paul Zimmerman. The All-America team is selected by a committee of writers representing all conferences and regions of the NCAA. The Writers' Team has been highlighted in various media forums. From 1946-70, Look published the FWAA team and brought players and selected writers to New York City for a celebration. During that 25-year period, the FWAA team was introduced on national television shows by Bob Hope, Steve Allen, Perry Como and others. After Look folded, the FWAA started a long association with NCAA Films (later known as NCAA Productions), which produced a 30-minute television show and sold it to sponsors. The team was part of ABC Television's 1981 College Football Series. From 1983-90, the team was either on ABC or ESPN, and since 1991 has returned to the national spotlight on ABC. The corporate sponsor for the Writers' team is AT&T;, after several years of Cingular being the sponsor. =WCFF= The Walter Camp Football Foundation (WCFF) All-America team is selected by the head coaches and sports information directors of the 120 Football Bowl Subdivision schools and certified by UHY Advisors, a New Haven-based accounting firm. Walter Camp, \\"The Father of American Football,\\" first selected an All-America team in 1889. The WCF claims an 80% participation rate in the voting for its All-America team. =Sporting News= Sporting News, formerly known as The Sporting News and known colloquially as TSN, have teams college football editors and staff select teams, which they have been doing since 1934. From that year through the 1962 season TSN's All- America team was picked by a poll of sportswriters. Beginning in 1964 the team was selected by \\"professional scouts and observers\\".The Sporting News, December 18, 1976, pg. 22. The Sporting News cited the advent of two-platoon football as the need to go to that system. =UPI= United Press International (UPI) is a defunct organization that selected players in a national poll of sportswriters and began selecting teams in 1925 as \\"United Press\\". In 1958, after it merged with the International News Service (INS), it became United Press International. The INS had chosen teams since 1913. UPI continued to choose an All-America team, based on a poll of sportswriters, through the 1996 season. =Central Press= The Central Press Association, a newspaper syndicate based in Cleveland, polled team school captains for its \\"Captain's All-America Team\\" =Newspaper Enterprise Association= :See: Newspaper Enterprise Association#College football awards Another media group who polled writers and players to compose its team.

The main impressive New York skyscraper style tower, recognised as a symbol of the police in Victoria, was designed by Public Works Chief Architect Percy Edgar Everett and constructed 1940–43.Biography – Percy Edgar Everett – Australian Dictionary of Biography The 1940s construction also included lower wings on the corner of Russell Street and Latrobe Street, incorporating the Police Theatrette / Ballroom, while an 1889 wing on Mackenzie Street remained of the earlier police buildings, and in 1970 a large brown brick building was added behind the tower. The main tower was famously used in the opening titles of the long- running television series Homicide, a fictional police drama series dealing with the homicide squad of the Victoria Police, who were located in the building. The building is located in what was a police and justice precinct; across the road on Russell Street is the Old Melbourne Gaol, old City Police Station and City Courts buildings (both now occupied by the RMIT University). The Russell Street Police Headquarters was the site of the Russell Street Bombing in 1986. The Victoria Police vacated the building in 1995, leaving it empty for many years while several failed redevelopment proposals including conversion to student accommodation and to a hotel came and went.

Jenkins (August 26, 1823 – March 30, 1915), was an American attorney, soldier, businessman and philanthropist who homesteaded Spokane, Washington. Biography Jenkins was born on a farm near Mount Pleasant, Ohio, to orthodox Quaker parents. He was educated at the local Quaker seminary and in the high school in Mount Pleasant. He studied law in Cincinnati, Ohio, and passed his bar exam. He moved to LaSalle, Illinois, where he established a prosperous legal practice. He was an acquaintance of Abraham Lincoln (both men were lawyers for the Illinois Circuit Courts). Chewelah Museum During the American Civil War, Jenkins served in the Union Army under Generals Grant, Pope, Sherman and Burnside in the Western Theater. Initially, he was the major of the 1st Illinois Cavalry. Jenkins saw his first combat action in two engagements near Lexington, Missouri, and helped negotiate the surrender of Federal forces in that vicinity to the Confederates in September 1861, becoming a prisoner of war. He was exchanged that November and returned to the ranks, commanding two companies of the cavalry at Bird's Point, Missouri, from December until the spring of 1862, when he was assigned command of a battalion of the 1st Illinois Cavalry in southern Missouri, where his men protected supply lines to the army of General Samuel Curtis operating in Arkansas. In mid-1863, Jenkins became the lieutenant colonel and later the colonel of the 14th Illinois Cavalry, a regiment which he helped recruit and train.Wilson, p. 100 Jenkins in 1890 Following the war he moved to the Washington Territory, establishing a law firm in Seattle in 1874Bagley, Clarence. \\" History of Seattle from the Earliest Settlement to the Present Time, Volume 1\\", p. 294 and serving as Seattle's city attorney in 1876.Office of the City Clerk, City of Seattle, \\" Corporation Counsel/City Attorney\\".

Accessed September 3, 2013 where he became a friend to Chief Spokane Garry and Chief Joseph the Younger, whom he admired for their honesty and integrity. Jenkins kept a photograph of Chief Joseph on his mantle. Jenkins donated part of his homestead and $5,000 for land and capital to build the Spokane County Courthouse. His daughter, Emma Rue, donated the eastern edge of their homestead to the city for the Coliseum (now the Spokane Veterans Memorial Arena). Jenkins, a strong supporter of education, attempted twice to fund the first university in Spokane, which ultimately failed due to the economic Panic of 1893. The colonel was also concerned about young men who had to forego higher education to work to support themselves and their families, so he created a trust of $50,000 to fund Spokane's first vocational school for adults, located in and directed by the YMCA. The Institute prospered, reaching its peak of popularity about the time World War I broke out. He retired to Chewelah, Washington. He is best known in Chewelah for donating the land and capital to build Jenkins High School in 1910. Jenkins loved animals; he bought land in Chewelah partly to house his many pets, including domesticated deer. He donated land in Spokane to establish a Humane Society (on which it stands today).

Marinera is a graceful and romantic couple's dance that uses handkerchiefs as props. The dance is a mix of Spanish contradanza and Andean zamacueca and is an elegant and stylized reenactment of a courtship, and it shows a blend of the different cultures of Peru. The dance itself has gained recognition throughout South America and is known as the most prominent traditional dance of Peru. The city of Trujillo has been recognized as the national birthplace of the marinera since 1986. The Marinera Festival, a cultural event dedicated to marinera held in Trujillo, has held annual competitions of the dance since 1960. In 2012, the Congress of Peru observed nationally October 7 as a commemorative day for the marinera. The dance is traditionally accompanied by several instruments: cajón, clarinets, guitars, drums, and bugles. History Peruvian paso dancing marinera The origins of the dance can be traced to Spanish, Moorish, Andean, and Gypsy rhythmic influences. Although the dance had informally been around in Peru since the colonial era, it was formally recognized as \\"Marinera\\" in honor of the Navy of Peru, or the Marina de Guerra del Peru in 1879 during the War of the Pacific. According to the Peruvian historian Romulo Cuneo Vidal, the Zamacueca was itself a dance of rest during the era of the Inca Empire. Thus, coming from such a far natively Peruvian background, the dance is itself simply a derivation of an ancient Peruvian dance. Ancient pottery dating from the Pre-Columbian era called huacos depicted people resting in Zamacueca positions. The first Marinera to be written in musical notation was La Concheperla composed by Abelardo Gamarra Rondó and José Alvarado, by Rosa Mercedes Ayarza de Morales in 1894. Creation theories=Peruvian proposal= The claim coming from Peru is that the dance is exclusively Peruvian. According to Peruvian historian Rómulo Cúneo Vidal, the zamacueca was itself a dance of rest during the times of the Inca Empire (And in some but that is not important Pre-Inca cultures). Thus, coming from such a far natively Peruvian background, the dance is itself simply a derivation of an ancient Peruvian dance. A fact that may validate this statement are the ancient huacos depicting people resting in Zamacueca positions. =Hispanic proposal= Some favor the idea that the ballroom dances of the days of the Viceroyalty (brought from Europe) are what later evolved into the Latin American dances such as the Marinera. According to its supporters, the European rhythms such as \\"Fandango\\" and \\"Cashuas\\" led to the creation of the Chilean Sajuriana, the Venezuelan Zambo, the Argentine Cielo Gaucho, the Mexican Tas-be, the Colombian Bambuco, the Ecuadorian Amor Fino, and the Peruvian Toro Mata. Varieties Peruvian Paso. Different schools and dancing styles of the Marinera exist, based on location. There are Marinera dance academies all over Peru, and competitions are frequently held. The most important competition is the National Competition of the Marinera (Concurso Nacional de Marinera) held during the National Festival of the Marinera (Festival Nacional de Marinera), held in Trujillo, every January. The three main variations are the Marinera Limeña, the Marinera Norteña, and the Marinera Serrana. Sometimes the Marinera is danced with a Chalan mounted on a Peruvian Paso (The horse dancing, and the Chalan directing it) =Marinera Limeña= This Marinera is elegant and a little slow-paced in comparison to other variations. The dance can be interpreted in low or high tones. The Marinera of contrapunto or \\"canto de jarana\\" usually consists of three Marineras, Resbalosa (Slippery), and a succession of \\"fugas\\" (Escapes). Nowadays, the Marinera Limeña seems to be becoming overshadowed by the Marinera Norteña, because of its popular qualities. Nevertheless, the dance still has a small number of fans that dance it during October fests or during the anniversary of Lima. =Marinera Norteña= It acquired characteristics of the Marinera Limeña, and soon enough it became a new variation of the dance. The dance itself tends to be quick-paced and though not as \\"elegant\\" as the Limeña, it can also be very stylish. Even though the dance originated in the Northern coasts of the country, it has become quite popular throughout Peru. It is thanks to that popularity that the Marinera is considered the National Dance of Peru, along with the Peruvian Waltz. In Marinera Norteña, the man wears shoes, while the woman dances completely barefoot. With constant practice women are even able to dance barefoot on extremely hot pavement and coarse, very rough surfaces, as the soles of their feet become well seasoned and toughened up, something they are really proud of. The dancer must go to the dance floor wearing their best clothes but with bare feet, in the same way they did the rural northern girls of the nineteenth century. Being forced to dance barefoot on any surface without showing any discomfort, professional dancers should practice enough to develop thick calluses on the soles of their feet.\\" \\"The Marinera Norteña allows men to wear shoes, but women must dance barefoot, soon developing thick calluses on their feet, of which they are proud to show off.\\" \\"It was in Trujillo that female dancers started the whole tradition of going barefoot—some even pride themselves on being able to put out cigarettes on their callused soles.\\" Very often the Marinera Norteña presentations on open air are purposedly scheduled at noon, when the pavement is hotter, because this motivates and encourages the barefoot female dancers to dance better and to conquer the Chalán and also because the public is astonished to see how the girls smile and enjoy as they burn the soles of their feet on the scorching hot ground. Besides high skills and constant rehearsals, marinera also demands great physical effort and sacrifices from the dancers, who must exercise and have a proper diet. In order to strengthen the soles of their feet it is known that many marinera dancer women train by walking barefoot in the street, going to different places as a part of their regular routine and in their spare time, becoming what's known as \\"barefooters\\". The braver, more advanced female dancers are even able to walk barefoot on broken glass and to put cigarettes out on the tough soles of their feet, in order to make them stronger and to show others what they are capable of. Men, on the other hand, have intense practice on \\"zapateo\\" and the different steps of the dance until they master them. A marinera norteña dancer leaves aside social life, family reunions and resting hours in order to dedicate time to his/hers passion. There's no \\"Marinera Dress\\". Female dancers should wear the typical clothing of the towns where this marinera style is performed. It's mandatory though that women dance barefoot. It is unacceptable for them to wear sandals, canvas shoes, ballet slippers or any kind of footwear to perform this dance. For the men it is typical to wear \\"chalan\\" clothing, with cotton poncho and wide straw hat. In some places they wear a white drill suit. Men wear black, glossy shoes. =Marinera Serrana= This Marinera is typical from the highland and mountain regions of Peru. It usually has a minor tone and is characterized by a slower movement. This marinera is also repeated twice, and then is followed by a \\"fuga de huayno\\". The second part is more sentimental than the first one.

Background  The British victory at Vinegar Hill on 21 June had denied the rebels static bases of operation but had not finished the rebellion and at least three major columns of rebels were operating throughout the southeast, moving outwards from county Wexford in an effort to spread and revive the rebellion. One such column, numbering about 1,000 but accompanied by a number of women and juveniles was mobile in north county Wexford, continually altering course to elude combined movements of pursuing British forces. The column was led by Joseph Holt and headed in the direction of Carnew, County Wicklow toward the security offered by its mountain ranges when one of its foraging parties was intercepted and destroyed by a cavalry patrol. It quickly became evident to the British authorities that this party was a detachment from the main body of rebels and a mounted force of 200 troops consisting of Ancient Britons, dragoons, and three yeomanry corps, assembled near the neighbourhood of Monaseed to begin a pursuit of the rebels.  Battle of Ballyellis  However, the approaching British had been spotted and a force of rebels then moved ahead of the main force to prepare an ambush at the townland of Ballyellis. The spot chosen was behind a curve in the road flanked by high ditches and estate walls; wagons were then placed on the road and access points cut into the ditches. The main force arrived and deployed itself behind the wagons, on the wall and ditches with a small force left to stand on the road ahead of the barricades standing to face and lure in the approaching soldiers. Upon spotting the small force standing on the road, the pursuing British quickened their pace and charged forwards, assuming that they were facing only the rearguard of the fleeing column. Upon reaching the turn, they were met by a barrage of gunfire and hemmed in by the rebels on three sides. As more mounted troops arrived they pressed their comrades further into the trap making effective manoeuvre impossible and many were easily picked off by the long pikes of the rebels. The rear-ranks quickly fled with a few more soldiers escaping by jumping their mounts over the ditch but the rebels organised a relentless pursuit of the soldiers who were tracked and killed through the adjoining fields. At the end of the action about 60 troops (including a French émigré) and two officers were killed for no rebel casualties.  Aftermath  The news of this rebel victory came as a shock to the authorities in Dublin Castle who had assumed that the offensive capabilities of the rebels had been finished at the battle of Vinegar Hill. Reports of the defeat were downplayed and the scale of losses withheld from the general public, but the military now recognised Wicklow as the main theatre of rebel operations and began to transfer troops there in anticipation of a new anti-insurgency campaign.

They are a large group of tribes ranging about the headwaters of the Bermejo River and the Pilcomayo River, in Argentina and Bolivia. Notes on designation This ethnic group was named by the English settlers and is still widely known as Mataco. The etymology of the term is obscure but in several sources, it is cited that the Wichí find the term derogatory. Among the group exists a folk etymology for this term, which relates it to the Spanish verb matar, to kill. Thus their preferred name, their own word for themselves, is Wichí, pronounced , and their language, Wichí Lhamtés . There is a pronunciation variant in some areas of Bolivia, , where the self-denomination of the group is Weenhayek wichi, translated by Alvarsson (1988) as \\"the different people\\" (pl. Weenhayey). Weenhayey informers of Alvarsson state that the old name was Olhamelh (), meaning simply us. The subgroups within Wichí have been identified and received different names in literature: Nocten or Octenay in Bolivia, Véjos or (perhaps more properly) Wejwus or Wehwos for the Western subgroup(s), and Güisnay for the Eastern subgroups of Argentina. The latter corresponds to Tewoq-lhelej, \\"the river people\\". Population At present, a number of Wichí groups can be found in Argentina and Bolivia, distributed as follows: * Argentina: **18 groups in the north-west of Chaco, about 180 km north-west of the town of Castelli. **Many communities in Formosa, departments of Bermejo (15 communities), Matacos (10 communities), Patiño (7 communities) and Ramón Lista (33 communities). **Other communities are located in Salta, departments of San Martín (21 communities), Rivadavia (57 communities, some of them with just a few individuals), Orán, Metán (2 communities) and Anta (3 communities), being the latter three more isolated; and in Jujuy, departments of Santa Bárbara, San Pedro and Ledesma. * Bolivia: Gran Chaco province, Tarija Department, on the Pilcomayo River, 14 communities living in the area from (and including) the town of Villa Montes up to D'Orbigny, in the Argentine border. Languages Wichi are the most widely spoken languages of the Matacoan language family, and include three languages: *Wichí Lhamtés Vejoz *Wichí Lhamtés Güisnay *Wichí Lhamtés Nocten. The total number of speakers can only be estimated; no reliable figures exist. Comparing several sources, the most probable number is from 40 to 50,000 individuals. The Argentine National Institute of Statistics and Censuses (INDEC) gives a figure of 36,135 for Argentina only. In Rosario, the third biggest city of Argentina, there's a community of about 10,000 wichi people, all of them fluent in whichi, and some native speakers. There are even a couple of bilingual primary schools. For Bolivia, Alvarsson estimated between 1,700 and 2,000 speakers in 1988; a census reported 1,912, and Diez Astete & Riester (1996) estimated between 2,300 and 2,600 Weenhayek in sixteen communities. According to Najlis (1968) and Gordon (2005), three main dialects can be distinguished in the Wichí group: southwestern or Vejós (Wehwós), northeastern or Güisnay (Weenhayek) and northwestern or Nocten (Oktenay). Tovar (1981) and other authors claim the existence of only two dialects (northeastern and southwestern), while Braunstein (1992-3) identifies eleven ethnical subgroups. The Wichí language is predominantly suffixing and polysynthetic; verbal words have between 2 and 15 morphemes. Alienable and inalienable possession is distinguished. The phonological inventory is large, with simple, glottalized and aspirated stops and sonorants. The number of vowels varies with dialect (five or six). History Much of the information available about the history of the Wichí comes from Jesuit and Franciscan missionaries of the 17th and 18th centuries. The first mission came in 1690, but it was unsuccessful. In 1771 the Franciscan Mission of Zenta found a better reception. However, with the decline of the Spanish power these missions also fell into decay. The Wichí territory does seem to have changed since the 18th century, when the first precise information on their existence and location were known. Their neighbors in the Pilcomayo River area were the Toba, and their lands on the Bermejo River extended from the current town of Embarcación, Salta, to a region north of current town of Castelli in the Chaco Province. According to Father Alejandro Corrado, a Franciscan of Tarija, the Wichí were nomadic; their houses were light structures scattered in the jungle. Corrado claims the Wichí lived chiefly upon fish and algarroba, that is, the fruit of the local algarrobo tree (usually identified with Prosopis alba or South American mesquite), as well as honey-locust, but \\"they ate anything that was not poisonous, even rats and grasshoppers\\". From the algarroba they were said to prepare an intoxicating liquor (this is probably aloja, produced by fermentation of the sugar-loaded patay paste inside the fruit). The ripening of the algarroba was celebrated by a ceremony. Also in Corrado's words, among the Wichí \\"everything is in common\\". He claimed that there was a division of tasks, the men occupying themselves with fishing or occasional hunting with bow or club, and the women doing practically all the other work. As for religious belief, Corrado wrote that the Wichí medicine men fight off disease \\"with singing and rattle\\", that the Wichí believe in a good spirit and a bad spirit, and that the soul of the deceased is reincarnated in an animal. The Pentecostal Church of Sweden started working within the Wichí community in the early parts of the last century which resulted in that a vast majority of the Weenhayek's are Christians. The fact that the terms of possessions and ownership does not exist within the community has made this conversion quite easy. Everyone owns everything (and nothing) together just as the Bible talks about was the case with the first churches as well. There are other facts that has helped the contextualisation of the gospel, like the Weenhayek being fishermen (in the Pilcomayo River ) just as some of the deciples of the bible. These facts has made it possible for the Weenhayek to maintain their unique cultural identity and traditions in spite of also embracing faith in Christianity. Current threats Wichí have traditionally lived from hunting, fishing and basic agriculture. Since the beginning of the 20th century, significant portions of their traditional land have been taken over by outsiders, and what was once a grassland became desertified by deforestation, introduction of cattle and, more recently, by the introduction of alien crops (soybean). A study made in 1998 by a graduate student from Clark University, Worcester, MA based on satellite photo surveys showed that between 1984 and 1996 20% of the forest has been lost. The Wichí were affected by the recession that lasted from 1999 to 2002, but their relative economic self-sufficiency, their physical isolation and the lack of recognition on the part of the authorities largely diminished the impact of the crisis, which was circumscribed on inflation in the price of certain goods they cannot produce (such as sugar and red meat, replaceable by wild honey and fish) and on problems with the supply of medicines and healthcare. For many years, the Wichí have been struggling to get legal titles to the land they traditionally own, constantly seized and fenced by non-indigenous cattlers and farmers. Their main claims are centered in two large public land areas in eastern Salta, known as Lote 55 (about 2,800 km²) and Lote 14. The Wichí rights to that land have been recognised by law, but no practical enforcement actions have been taken by the Salta provincial government. At the beginning of 2004, the government of Salta decided to lift the protected status of the General Pizarro Natural Reserve, an area of 250 km² in the Anta Department inhabited by about 100 Wichí, and sell part of the land to two private companies, Everest SA and Initium Aferro SA, to be deforested and planted with soybean. After months of complaints, legal struggle, and a campaign sponsored by Greenpeace, on 29 September 2005 (after an exposure in a popular TV show) a group of Argentine artists, actors, musicians, models, environmental groups and Wichí representatives arranged a hearing with Chief of Cabinet Alberto Fernández, Director of the National Parks Administration Héctor Espina and President Néstor Kirchner himself. The national government promised to discuss the matter with Salta governor Juan Carlos Romero. On 14 October 2005 the National Parks Administration and the government of Salta signed an agreement to create a new national protected area in General Pizarro. Of the approximately 213 km² comprised by the new reserve, the Wichí will have the right of use of 22 km², and they will own 8 km². El Chaco, where Wichí also live, is the largest subtropical dry broadleaf forest of the earth. Currently, the Wichí and other indigenous groups are in danger of losing their land and livelihood to agrobusinesses. Soy and cotton farmers want to cut the trees in order to expand cultivation. The Chaco forest is being cut down six times faster than the Amazon jungle. The greatest profiteers are logging companies. Additionally, soy cultivation has accelerated deforestation. In a lot of cases this also means, that the indigenous communities lose their land to agrobusinesses and suffer under the intense use of fertilizers and pesticides, that poisons the water they depend on. Since 2008, many indigenous people are organised in the “Movimiento Nacional Campesino Indígena” (National Movement of Indigenous Peasants) and fight for the legal right to their land.Conquest by chainsaw http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/logging-subtropical-dry-forest- deprives-indigenous-people-argentina-their-livelihood Wichí society Wichí, as other hunter-gatherer peoples, were semi-nomadic. Even today and despite transculturation, there is a fairly large number of montaraces (nomadic) communities or clans. Each Wichí village has its own territory, but usually a few communities share the use of the overlapping areas. Each community consists of one or more clans. Wichi society is matrilocal, i.e., people belong to their mothers' clans; upon marriage, men move to their wives' villages. Individuals and families of some of the neighboring peoples like the Iyojwaja (Chorote), Nivaklé, Qomlek (Toba) and Tapy'y (Tapieté) often live amongst the Wichí, sometimes marrying into their society. They build small mud houses with roofs made of leaves and branches, well adapted to the high temperatures of summer that can reach 50 °C (120 °F). During the dry season (winter) they depend on fishing in the Bermejo and Pilcomayo rivers, and cultivate corn, pumpkins, beans and watermelons during summer. Throughout the year the Wichí hunt deers (Cervidae) like \\"guasuncho\\" (Mazama goauzoubira) and \\"corzuela roja\\" (Mazama americana), armadillos (Dasypus, Tolypeutes and Euphractus genii), rabbits (\\"tapetí\\", Sylvilagus brasiliensis), several types of iguana and peccaries (Tayassu albirostris, Tayassu tajacu); search for wild honey and gather fruits. For centuries they have used the strong fibers of chaguar (Bromelia serra, Bromelia hieronymi) for weaving nets, purses and other textile objects; some communities base a substantial part of their economy in selling chaguar handicrafts. The most popular game among the Wichí is a team sport called \`yaj ha\`lä, which resembles lacrosse. Games usually last from dawn to dusk without interruption, and are agreed between clans. The magical significance of the game is lost, but it is still a subject of heavy gambling: rival clans bet animals, clothes, seeds and horses on the outcome of the game.

It was produced by Cookie Jar Entertainment for CBC Television. The Doodlebops' starred Lisa Lennox as Deedee Doodle, Chad McNamara as Rooney Doodle, and Jonathan Wexler as Moe Doodle. The Doodlebops were members of a children's band. The series featured a mix of music, dancing, humor, and skits that taught social lessons. It included scenes from a concert in front of a preschool audience who actively participated in the singing and dancing. The band members wore heavy makeup and/or prosthetics to look like live action cartoon characters. In the United States, The Doodlebops aired on Disney Channel's Playhouse Disney block from 2005 to 2009 and on Cookie Jar TV from 2010 to 2013. It now shows reruns on Starz Kids & Family.

Episodes=Series overviewSeason 1 (2005)Season 2 (2005-2006)Season 3 (2007)=Recurrent themes * Where's Moe? – Deedee and Rooney enter through a door and introduce themselves (with Deedee getting praise and Rooney not getting good reception), and subsequently can't find Moe. Deedee or Rooney will say says \\"Uh-oh, where's Moe?\\" This initiates the recurring \\"Where's Moe?\\" theme, in which the two Doodlebops search for Moe, sometimes acquiring help from Moosehead or Mudge. Eventually, Moe reveals himself, after the Doodlebops are not successful in finding him. However, sometimes, the two Doodlebops find him. * The Pledge – The lights in the clubhouse go dark and the Doodlebops all line up together and recite the Doodlebop pledge, waving their flags in the process. Once they finish, they all engage in acrobatic activities for a few seconds. * It's Mazz & Jazzmin! – After the Doodlebops pledge, their manager Jazzmin appears from behind a bookshelf, scat singing before speaking in rhyme to the Doodlebops. She departs by snapping her fingers and disappearing, which the Doodlebops then try to copy and wonder how she does it. * Don't Pull the Rope! – Just before the Doodlebops head into the recording studio to meet with Audio Murphy, a rope falls from the ceiling, which Moe pulls down, regardless of the others warnings of pulling the rope. When Moe tells something related to the episode’s theme while managing to pull the rope anyway, he is drenched in water and subsequently shakes it off. * Get on the Bus! – The Doodlebops each join Bus Driver Bob on his bus after their session at the recording studio ends. Bob honks the bus' horn, the Doodlebops board, and dance and sing their way to the Doodlebops concert. =Changes from season 1 to season 2= There were several production and design changes that occurred on the TV show between season one and season two. Among them: * Most episodes in season 1 were processed by using Film look, but in season 2, the episodes were filmized. * The opening montage ends with a computer generated version of the interior of the Doodlebops' clubhouse. In season one a jib arm was used for a real shot of the room. * Mr. Moosehead announces the name of the episode starting with season two. In season one, he would just say \\"Go Doodlebops\\" during the title card. * The Doodlebops wore a Spandex hood that matched their makeup, with fake ears attached to make them appear more cartoon-like. In season two, the stick out style ears were removed, along with the hood. * Deedee's bouffant hair style became slightly bigger, and more stylish between season one and two. * Deedee's keytar is different and so is Rooney's guitar. Moe sometimes uses a portable version of his drums during the video. * Two talking mannequin heads, who looked and sounded like a mocked up version of British royalty, were gone after season one. * Occasional appearances from a chicken, a small alien, and other smaller creatures during the search for Moe no longer appeared after season 1. * Moe frequently shrinks himself in order to hide from his fellow Doodlebops during the \\"Where's Moe?\\" sequence. In season one, Moe did not display his shrinking ability, opting to hide behind props, inside of boxes, etc. * During season two, \\"The Pledge\\" has a longer introduction and a playful acrobatic sequence at the end. * In season two, the featured song of the episode is performed by the Doodlebops in Audio Murphy's recording studio. In season one, the song is performed at Doodlebop Central (sometimes accompanied by Mazz). * In season two, the Doodlebops manager, Jazzmin, is able to snap her fingers then disappear when she leaves, only to have the Doodlebops ask, \\"How does she do that?\\" at every occurrence. In season one, the manager was Mazz, who would exit the same way that she came in which was through a secret passage on the wall, while singing a jazzy scat style lyric. Jazzmin also does a slightly different jazz style lyrics in season two. * Although not a very big change, the splash that hits Moe's head after he pulls the ropes is a much bigger splash in season two than in season one. Moe also grunts while shaking the water off and no longer utters “Refreshing” after getting splashed. * After Moe pulls the rope, the Doodlebops head straight to their recording studio where they record and shoot the video for their upcoming concert with Audio Murphy. In season one, no recording studio was used and the Doodlebops would head outdoors to play and go about having fun. * The \\"Get on the Bus\\" sequence underwent several changes from season one to season two. The bus itself was increased in size (from the outside), slight artistic alterations in the interior, the dance music was re- recorded adding in more instruments (such as horns or percussion); the Doodlebops no longer performed a \\"musical break\\" in the middle of the song. * In season two, while on stage, each of the Doodlebops would have an article of clothing that is more sparkly than their usual everyday attire. However, when they are backstage and about to run onto the stage and start singing, they still have their casual costumes on. When the curtains go up, their concert outfits seem to have magically appeared on them when they ran onstage. *In season one, during the concert segment the Doodlebops would perform two songs, sometimes three, or even four. Starting with season two, the concert was shortened to two songs maximum. In some episodes, only one song is performed. * Deedee performs the \\"Knock Knock\\" joke in every episode with Mudge, and it takes place at a hot dog stand where Mudge is the hot dog attendant. In season one, this skit was performed in front of Deedee's mirror. * The ending song is cut down in most episodes for timing reasons. =Changes made in season 3= * Deedee's keyboard on the concert stage is now more like a benchtop. * The \\"Knock Knock\\" joke goes back to taking place in front of the mirror, and has shifted the emphasis off the \\"knock-knock\\" variety. Also, the curtain doesn't come down during this segment anymore. * The Doodlebops do the dance they did in Audio Murphy's studio again on stage. The dance is known as the Dance of the Day and is shown to the kids before the concert. * To change into their tour jackets and their concert gear, the Doodlebops spin around. On the later costume change, they say \\"We're the Doodlebops!\\" while changing. * The bookcase spins around instead of sliding outwards when Jazzmin comes in. * The \\"Get on the Bus\\" song is sometimes cut down to save time. * The background during the end credits is changed to one of the Doodlebops meeting and greeting their fans before the show. Rockin' Road Show After The Doodlebops TV series was cancelled, the Doodlebops returned for a 2010 animated TV series called Doodlebops Rockin' Road Show. The series, like the live action version, was produced by Cookie Jar Entertainment; however, in Germany it was co-produced with Optix Entertainment and in Argentina it was co-produced with Illusion Studios.https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cbc- picks-doodlebops-spinoff-20819 Jazzmin, Audio Murphy, Mr. Moosehead, and Mudge no longer appeared, since the Doodlebops were on tour. The only characters seen in every episode were Bus Driver Bob, Deedee, Rooney, Moe, and a small pink dog named Bop-Bop. In each episode, Mail Snail would deliver the Doodlebops a DVD sent by a live acted child in need of help. The child would then be turned into an animated character and sent to the bus to be a \\"Doodle for a Day\\". The Doodlebops: Together Forever Tour A live theatrical show entitled The Doodlebops: Together Forever Tour was developed and toured Canada in early 2009. The show includes musical performances of signature favorites as well as new songs. The live version incorporates giant screens and original sets and costumes. This production features a new cast of performers portraying the Doodlebops. The show was produced by Koba Entertainment, and presented by Paquin Entertainment.

Officially, secularism has always inspired modern India. In practice, unlike Western notions of secularism, India's secularism does not separate religion and state. The Indian Constitution has allowed extensive interference of the state in religious affairs. India does partially separate religion and state. For example, it does not have an official state religion and state-owned educational institutions cannot impart religious instructions. In matters of law in modern India, however, the applicable code of law is unequal, and India's personal laws – on matters such as marriage, divorce, inheritance, alimony – varies with an individual's religion. The Indian Constitution permits partial financial support for religious schools, as well as the financing of religious buildings and infrastructure by the state. The Islamic Central Wakf Council and many Hindu temples of great religious significance are administered and managed by the Indian government. The attempt to respect unequal, religious law has created a number of issues in India such as acceptability of polygamy, unequal inheritance rights, extra judicial unilateral divorce rights favorable to some males, and conflicting interpretations of religious books. Secularism as practiced in India, with its marked differences with Western practice of secularism, is a controversial topic in India. Supporters of the Indian concept of secularism claim it respects \\"minorities and pluralism\\". Critics claim the Indian form of secularism as \\"pseudo-secularism\\". Supporters state that any attempt to introduce a uniform civil code, that is equal laws for every citizen irrespective of his or her religion, would impose majoritarian Hindu sensibilities and ideals. Critics state that India's acceptance of Sharia and religious laws violates the principle of Equality before the law.  History  Ellora Caves, a world heritage site, are in the Indian state of Maharashtra. The 35 caves were carved into the vertical face of the Charanandri hills between the 5th and 10th centuries. The 12 Buddhist caves, 17 Hindu caves and 5 Jain caves, built in proximity, suggest religious co- existence and secular sentiments for diversity prevalent during pre-Islamic period of Indian history.Pia Brancaccio (2000). \\"The Buddhist Caves at Aurangabad: The Impact of the Laity\\". Ars Orientalis, Vol. 30, Supplement 1, pp. 41–50Owen, L. (2012). Carving Devotion in the Jain Caves at Ellora (Vol. 41). Brill, The Netherlands Ashoka about 2200 years ago, Harsha about 1400 years ago accepted and patronised different religions. The people in ancient India had freedom of religion, and the state granted citizenship to each individual regardless of whether someone's religion was Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism or any other. Ellora cave temples built next to each other between 5th and 10th centuries, for example, shows a coexistence of religions and a spirit of acceptance of different faiths.Ellora Caves UNESCO, World Heritage List (1983)Brockman, N. (2011), [ Encyclopedia of sacred places]; 2nd Edition; see entries for Ajanta, Ellora and other sacred places of India, This approach to interfaith relations changed with the arrival of Islam and establishment of Delhi Sultanate in North India by the 12th century, followed by Deccan Sultanate in Central India. The political doctrines of Islam, as well as its religious views were at odds with doctrines of Hinduism, Christianity and other Indian religions.Makarand Paranjape (2009), Altered Destinations: Self, Society, and Nation in India, London, Anthem Press South Asian Studies, , pp 150-152 New temples and monasteries were not allowed. As with Levant, Southeast Europe and Spain, Islamic rulers in India treated Hindus as dhimmis in exchange of annual payment of jizya taxes, in a sharia-based state jurisprudence. With the arrival of Mughal era, Sharia was imposed with continued zeal, with Akbar – the Mughal Emperor – as the first significant exception. Akbar sought to fuse ideas, professed equality between Islam and other religions of India, forbade forced conversions to Islam, abolished religion-based discriminatory jizya taxes, and welcomed building of Hindu temples.See \\"Mughal Empire\\". Gale Encyclopedia of World History: Governments. Vol. 1. Detroit; Gale, 2008Richards, John F. The Mughal Empire. New York: Cambridge University Press, 1993 However, the descendants of Akbar, particularly Aurangzeb, reverted to treating Islam as the primary state religion, destruction of temples, and reimposed religion-based discriminatory jizya taxes. Akbar's tomb at Sikandra, near Agra India. Akbar's instruction for his mausoleum was that it incorporate elements from different religions including Islam and Hinduism. After Aurangzeb, India came into control of East India Company and the British Raj. The colonial administrators did not separate religion from state, but marked the end of equal hierarchy between Islam and Hinduism, and reintroduced the notion of equality before the law for Hindus, Christians and Muslims. The British Empire sought commerce and trade, with a policy of neutrality to all of India's diverse religions. Before 1858, the Britishers followed the policy of patronizing and supporting the native religions as the earlier rulers had done.Domenic Marbaniang, Secularism in India, 2005 as cited by Shiv Shankar Das in \\"Buddha Dharma, Secular Laws and Bahujan Politics in Uttar Pradesh\\", Madhya Pradesh Journal of Social Sciences, Vol.19. No.1, June 2014, p. 121 By the mid-19th century, the British Raj administered India, in matters related to marriage, inheritance of property and divorces, according to personal laws based on each Indian subject's religion, according to interpretations of respective religious documents by Islamic jurists, Hindu pundits and other religious scholars. In 1864, the Raj eliminated all religious jurists, pandits and scholars because the interpretations of the same verse or religious document varied, the scholars and jurists disagreed with each other, and the process of justice had become inconsistent and suspiciously corrupt. The late 19th century marked the arrival of Anglo-Hindu and Anglo-Muslim personal laws to divide adjacent communities by British, where the governance did not separate the state and religion, but continued to differentiate and administer people based on their personal religion. The British Raj provided the Indian Christians, Indian Zoroastrians and others with their own personal laws, such as the Indian Succession Act of 1850, Special Marriage Act of 1872 and other laws that were similar to Common Laws in Europe.Nandini Chatterjee, The Making of Indian Secularism: Empire, Law and Christianity Macmillan, Although the British administration provided India with a common law, its divide and rule policy contributed to promoting discord between communities.Shashi Tharoor, \\"The Partition: The British game of 'divide and rule'\\" The Morley-Minto reforms provided separate electorate to Muslims, justifying the demands of the Muslim league. In the first half of 20th century, the British Raj faced increasing amounts of social activism for self-rule by a disparate groups such as those led by Hindu Gandhi and Muslim Jinnah; the colonial administration, under pressure, enacted a number of laws before India's independence in 1947, that continue to be the laws of India in 2013. One such law enacted during the colonial era was the 1937 Indian Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, which instead of separating state and religion for Western secularism, did the reverse. It, along with additional laws such as Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act of 1939 that followed, established the principle that religious laws of Indian Muslims can be their personal laws. It also set the precedent that religious law, such as sharia, can overlap and supersede common and civil laws, that elected legislators may not revise or enact laws that supersede religious laws, that people of one nation need not live under the same laws, and that law enforcement process for different individuals shall depend on their religion. The Indian Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act of 1937 continues to be the law of land of modern India for Indian Muslims, while parliament-based, non-religious uniform civil code passed in mid-1950s applies to Indians who are Hindus (which includes Buddhists, Jains, Sikhs, Parsees), as well as to Indian Christians and Jews.Chandra Mallampalli, Christians and Public Life in Colonial India: Contending with Marginality (London, 2004) Current status The 7th schedule of Indian constitution places religious institutions, charities and trusts into so-called Concurrent List, which means that both the central government of India, and various state governments in India can make their own laws about religious institutions, charities and trusts. If there is a conflict between central government enacted law and state government law, then the central government law prevails. This principle of overlap, rather than separation of religion and state in India was further recognised in a series of constitutional amendments starting with Article 290 in 1956, to the addition of word 'secular' to the Preamble of Indian Constitution in 1975. The central and state governments of India finance and manage religious buildings and infrastructure. Above, the inauguration of National Waqf Development Corporation Limited in 2014 for Waqf properties.Prime Minister to Launch National Waqf Development Corporation Tomorrow, Press Information Bureau, Government of India, Ministry of Minority Affairs, 28 January 2014 The overlap of religion and state, through Concurrent List structure, has given various religions in India, state support to religious schools and personal laws. This state intervention while resonant with the dictates of each religion, are unequal and conflicting. For example, a 1951 Religious and Charitable Endowment Indian law allows state governments to forcibly take over, own and operate Hindu temples,K. N. Kumari (1998), History of the Hindu Religious Endowments in Andhra Pradesh, Northern Books, and collect revenue from offerings and redistribute that revenue to any non- temple purposes including maintenance of religious institutions opposed to the temple;Presler, F. A. (1983). \\"The structure and consequences of temple policy in Tamil Nadu, 1967-81\\". Pacific Affairs, 56(2), 232-246 Indian law also allows Islamic religious schools to receive partial financial support from state and central government of India, to offer religious indoctrination, if the school agrees that the student has an option to opt out from religious indoctrination if he or she so asks, and that the school will not discriminate any student based on religion, race or other grounds. Educational institutions wholly owned and operated by government may not impart religious indoctrination, but religious sects and endowments may open their own school, impart religious indoctrination and have a right to partial state financial assistance. In matters of personal law, such as acceptable age of marriage for girls, female circumcision, polygamy, divorce and inheritance, Indian law permits each religious group to implement their religious law if the religion so dictates, otherwise the state laws apply. In terms of religions of India with significant populations, only Islam has religious laws in form of sharia which India allows as Muslim Personal Law. Secularism in India, thus, does not mean the separation of religion from state. Instead, secularism in India means a state that supports or participates in a neutral manner in the affairs of all religious groups. Religious laws in personal domain, particularly for Muslim Indians, supersede parliamentary laws in India; and currently, in some situations such as religious indoctrination schools the state partially finances certain religious schools. These differences have led a number of scholarsMadan, T. N. (1987), \\"Secularism in Its Place\\", Journal of Asian Studies, 46 (4): 747–759 to declare that India is not a secular state, as the word secularism is widely understood in the West and elsewhere; rather it is a strategy for political goals in a nation with a complex history, and one that achieves the opposite of its stated intentions. The attempt to have a Uniform Civil Code has long been discussed as a means to realize a secular Indian state. The overlap between religion and state has created tension between supporters of Indian form of secularism and the supporters of Hindu nationalism. Hindu nationalists use the Uniform Civil Code platform to agitate their base, even though there has been no actual implementation. They characterize secularism as practiced in India as \\"pseudo-secularism\\", a camouflaged hypocrisy for the political \\"appeasement of minorities\\"., Quote: \\"they contend that secularism, as practiced in India, has amounted to little more than the pampering of minorities and is therefore pseudo-secularism.\\" Comparison with Western secularism In the West, the word secular implies three things: freedom of religion, equal citizenship to each citizen regardless of his or her religion, and the separation of religion and state (polity). One of the core principles in the constitution of Western democracies has been this separation, with the state asserting its political authority in matters of law, while accepting every individual's right to pursue his or her own religion and the right of religion to shape its own concepts of spirituality. Everyone is equal under law, and subject to the same laws irrespective of his or her religion, in the West. In contrast, in India, the word secular does not mean a \\"thorough-going separation of religion and state\\" states Donald Smith. However, some separation exists. According to the Constitution of India, states Smith, there is no official state religion in India, schools that are wholly owned by the state can not mandate religious instruction (Article 28), and there can be no taxes to support any particular religion (Article 27). Overlap is permitted, whereby institutions that are not entirely financed by the state can mandate religious instruction, and state can provide financial aid to maintain and construct religious buildings or infrastructure. Furthermore, India's constitutional framework allows \\"extensive state interference in religious affairs\\". According to R.A. Jahagirdar, in the Indian context, secularism has been interpreted as the equal treatment of all religions.Justice R. A. Jahagirdar, \\"Secularism in India\\" , International Humanist and Ethical Union, 11 May 2003. In particular, the most significant impact of religion in everyday life of an Indian citizen is in matters of civil law – marriage, divorce, inheritance and others. The Indian Constitution allows the applicable personal law to be different if an individual's religion is Hinduism (or another Indian religion), Islam or Christianity. However, Article 44 of the Directive Principles of State Policy adds, \\"the state shall endeavor to secure for the citizens a uniform civil code throughout the territory of India.\\" This intent for secular personal laws has been unsettling especially to Indian Muslims, states Smith, in part because they view the alteration of Muslim personal law to be a \\"grave violation of their freedom of religion\\". The term secularism in India also differs from the French concept for secularity, namely laïcité.Elizabeth Hurd (2008), The Politics of Secularism in International Relations, Princeton University Press While the French concept demands absence of governmental institutions in religion, as well as absence of religion in governmental institutions and schools; the Indian concept, in contrast, provides financial support to religious schools and accepts religious law over governmental institutions. The Indian structure has created incentives for various religious denominations to start and maintain schools, impart religious education, and receive partial but significant financial support from the Indian government. Similarly, the Indian government has established statutory institutions to regulate and financially administer the Islamic Central Wakf Council, historic Hindu temples, Buddhist monasteries, and certain Christian religious institutions; this direct Indian government involvement in various religions is markedly different from Western secularism.D. D. Acevedo (2013), \\"Secularism in the Indian Context\\", Law & Social Inquiry, Volume 38, Issue 1, pp 138–167, Gary Jacobsohn, The Wheel of Law: India's Secularism in Comparative Constitutional Context, Princeton University Press, 2005 According to Ashis Nandy, a better term for \\"Indian secularism\\" would be \\"religious tolerance\\", rather than importing and redefining the Western concept of secularism.Nandy A, \\"A Billion Gandhis\\", Outlook India, 21 June 2004 Issues Indian concept of secularism, where religious laws supersede state laws and the state is expected to even-handedly involve itself in religion, is a controversial subject.Craig Duncan, \\"Shah Bano: The Dilemma of Religious Liberty and Sex Equality\\", Cornell University, Ithaca, 2009 Any attempts and demand by the Indian populace to a uniform civil code is considered a threat to right to religious personal laws by Indian Muslims.M.G. Radhakrishnan (22 September 2013). \\"Muslim groups want minimum marital age scrapped\\". India Today. =Shah Bano case= In 1978, the Shah Bano case brought the secularism debate along with a demand for uniform civil code in India to the forefront.John H. Mansfield, \\"The Personal Laws or a Uniform Civil Code?\\" in Robert D. Baird, ed., Religion and Law in Independent India (Manohar Press, 1993), pp. 139–177 Shah Bano was a 62-year-old Muslim Indian who was divorced by her husband of 44 years in 1978. Indian Muslim Personal Law required her husband to pay no alimony. Shah Bano sued for regular maintenance payments under Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1978. Shah Bano won her case, as well appeals to the highest court. Along with alimony, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of India wrote in his opinion just how unfairly Islamic personal laws treated women and thus how necessary it was for the nation to adopt a Uniform Civil Code. The Chief Justice further ruled that no authoritative text of Islam forbade the payment of regular maintenance to ex- wives.Laura Jenkins, Shah Bano: Muslim Women's Rights, University of Cincinnati, Ohio (2000) The Shah Bano ruling immediately triggered a controversy and mass demonstrations by Muslim men. The Islamic Clergy and the Muslim Personal Law Board of India, argued against the ruling. Shortly after the Supreme Court's ruling, the Indian government with Rajiv Gandhi as Prime Minister, enacted a new law which deprived all Muslim women, and only Muslim women, of the right of maintenance guaranteed to women of Hindu, Christian, Parsees, Jews and other religions. Indian Muslims consider the new 1986 law, which selectively exempts them from maintenance payment to ex-wife because of their religion, as secular because it respects Muslim men's religious rights and recognises that they are culturally different from Indian men and women of other religions. Muslim opponents argue that any attempt to introduce Uniform Civil Code, that is equal laws for every human being independent of his or her religion, would reflect majoritarian Hindu sensibilities and ideals.Kirti Singh, \\"Obstacles to Women's Rights in India\\", in Rebecca J. Cook, ed. Human Rights of Women: National and International Perspectives (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1994), pp. 375–396 =Islamic feminists= The controversy is not limited to Hindu versus Muslim populations in India. The Islamic feminists movement in India, for example, claimSylvia Vatuk, \\"Islamic Feminism in India: Indian Muslim Women Activists and the Reform of Muslim Personal Law\\", Modern Asian Studies, Volume 42, Issue 2–3, March 2008, pp. 489–518 that the issue with Muslim Personal Law in India is a historic and ongoing misinterpretation of the Quran. The feminists claim that the Quran grants Muslim women rights that in practice are routinely denied to them by male Muslim ulema in India. They claim that the 'patriarchal' interpretations of the Quran on the illiterate Muslim Indian masses is abusive, and they demand that they have a right to read the Quran for themselves and interpret it in a woman-friendly way. India has no legal mechanism to accept or enforce the demands of these Islamic feminists over religious law. =Women's rights in India= Some religious rights granted by Indian concept of secularism, which are claimed as abusive against Indian women, include child marriage, polygamy, unequal inheritance rights of women and men, extrajudicial unilateral divorce rights of Muslim man that are not allowed to a Muslim woman, and subjective nature of shariat courts, jamaats, dar-ul quzat and religious qazis who preside over Islamic family law matters.Zoya Hasan and Ritu Menon (2005), The Diversity of Muslim Women's Lives in India, Rutgers University Press, , pp. 26–45, 59–64, 92–119 Triple Talaq was banned in India, following a historic bill being passed on 30 July 2019. =State subsidy for religious pilgrimage= India continued offering liberal subsidies for religious pilgrimage after 1950, under its polymorphous interpretation of secularism. The largest and most controversial has been the Haj subsidy program for the Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca, which was criticized as benefitting affluent Muslims and discriminatory against Hindus and Christians who did not get similar subsidy for trips to their own holy places. The central government spent about $120 million in Haj subsidies in 2011. In 2012, the Supreme Court of India ordered an end to the religious subsidies program within 10 years. According to a Wall Street Journal article, Indian Muslim leaders supported an end to the Hajj subsidies, because \\"people from other religions don't get subsidies for pilgrimages: Why should we? We all are equal citizens of the country.\\" =Goa= Goa is the only state in India which has Uniform Civil Code. This system is derived from Portuguese colonization and is maintained until today. The Goa Civil Code, also called the Goa Family Law, is the set of civil laws that governs the residents of the Indian state of Goa. In India, as a whole, there are religion-specific civil codes that separately govern adherents of different religions. Goa is an exception to that rule, in that a single secular code/law governs all Goans, irrespective of religion, ethnicity or linguistic affiliation. It suggests the possibility to establish uniform civil code within a country having rich religious diversity like India. There are still problems in terms of actual implementation in everyday life. =Article 25(2)(b)= Article 25(2)(b) of the Indian constitution clubs Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains along with Hindus, a position contested by some of these community leaders. Views A Hindu temple in Jaipur, India, merging the traditional tiered tower of Hinduism, the pyramid stupa of Buddhism and the dome of Islam. The marble sides are carved with figures of Hindu deities, as well as Christian Saints and Jesus Christ. Writing in the Wall Street Journal, Sadanand Dhume criticises Indian \\"Secularism\\" as a fraud and a failure, since it isn't really \\"secularism\\" as it is understood in the western world (as separation of religion and state) but more along the lines of religious appeasement. He writes that the flawed understanding of secularism among India's left wing intelligentsia has led Indian politicians to pander to religious leaders and preachers including Zakir Naik, and has led India to take a soft stand against Islamic terrorism, religious militancy and communal disharmony in general. Historian Ronald Inden writes:Ronald Inden. Imagining India. Indiana University Press. 2000. p. xii. Amartya Sen, the Indian Nobel Laureate, suggestsAmartya Sen (2006), The Argumentative Indian: Writings on Indian History, Culture and Identity; ; Picador that secularism in the political – as opposed to ecclesiastical – sense requires the separation of the state from any particular religious order. This, claims Sen, can be interpreted in at least two different ways: \\"The first view argues the state be equidistant from all religions – refusing to take sides and having a neutral attitude towards them. The second view insists that the state must not have any relation at all with any religion,\\" quotes Minhaz Merchant. In both interpretations, secularism goes against giving any religion a privileged position in the activities of the state. Sen argues that the first form is more suited to India, where there is no demand that the state stay clear of any association with any religious matter whatsoever. Rather what is needed is to make sure that in so far as the state has to deal with different religions and members of different religious communities, there must be a basic symmetry of treatment. Sen does not claim that modern India is symmetric in its treatment or offer any views of whether acceptance of sharia in matters such as child marriage is equivalent to having a neutral attitude towards a religion. Critics of Sen claim that secularism, as practised in India, is not the secularism of first or second variety Sen enumerates. Author Taslima Nasreen sees Indian secularists as pseudo secularist, accusing them of being biased towards Muslims saying, \\"Most secular people are pro-Muslims and anti- Hindu. They protest against the acts of Hindu fundamentalists and defend the heinous acts of Muslim fundamentalists.\\" She also said that most Indian politicians appease Muslims which leads to anger among Hindus. Pakistani columnist Farman Nawaz in his article \\"Why Indian Muslim Ullema are not popular in Pakistan?\\" states \\"Maulana Arshad Madani stated that seventy years ago the cause of division of India was sectarianism and if today again the same temptation will raise its head then results will be the same. Maulana Arshad Madani considers secularism inevitable for the unity of India.\\" Maulana Arshad Madani is a staunch critic of sectarianism in India. He is of the opinion that India was divided in 1947 because of sectarianism. He suggests secularism inevitable for the solidarity and integrity of India.

A puttee, also spelled puttie, is the name, adapted from the Hindi paṭṭī, bandage (Skt. paṭṭa, strip of cloth), for a covering for the lower part of the leg from the ankle to the knee, alternatively known as: legwraps, leg bindings, winingas, or wickelbander. They consist of a long narrow piece of cloth wound tightly, and spirally round the leg, and serving to provide both support and protection. They were worn by both mounted and dismounted soldiers, generally taking the place of the leather or cloth gaiter. History Roman fasciae crurales, depicted in a 4th-century CE hunting scene Puttees of bog boy Søgårds Mose Man, Denmark, early Iron Age King Edgar of England, 966 CE Battle of Hastings, 1066 CE Soldiers of the Queen's Own Corps of Guides of the British Indian Army in 1897.Boris Mollo, p128 \\"The Indian Army\\", They are in various orders of uniform but all wear puttees. Worn since antiquity, the puttee was adopted as part of the service uniform of foot and mounted soldiers serving in British India during the second half of the nineteenth century. In its original form the puttee comprised long strips of cloth worn as a tribal legging in the Himalayas. The British Indian Army found this garment to be both comfortable and inexpensive, although it was considered to lack the smartness of the gaiter previously worn.Boris Mollo, p158 \\"The Indian Army\\", According to the British author and soldier Patrick Leigh Fermor, infantry puttees were wound up from ankle to knee, but in cavalry regiments they were wound down from knee to ankle.Quoted in \\"Patrick Leigh Fermor: An Adventure\\" by Artemis Cooper, London 2012, page 37 The puttee was subsequently widely adopted by a number of armies including those of the British Commonwealth, the Austro-Hungarian Army, the Chinese National Revolutionary Army, the Belgian Army, the Ethiopian Army, the Dutch Army, the Imperial German Army (when stocks of leather long marching boots ran short during WWI), the French Army, the Imperial Japanese Army, the Italian Army, the Portuguese Army, the Turkish Army and the United States Army. Most of these armies adopted puttees during or shortly before World War I. Puttees were in general use by the British Army as part of the khaki service uniform worn from 1902, until 1938 when a new battledress was introduced, which included short webbing gaiters secured with buckles.R.M. Barnes, p282 \\"A History of the Regiments & Uniforms of the British Army\\", First Sphere Books 1972 One of the largest providers of the puttee during World War I to the British Army was Fox Brothers, produced at Tonedale Mill, Somerset. Puttees generally ceased to be worn as part of military uniform during World War II. Reasons included the difficulty of quickly donning an item of dress that had to be wound carefully around each leg, plus medical reservations regarding hygiene and varicose veins. However the cheapness and easy availability of cloth leggings meant that they were retained in the Italian, French, Japanese and some other armies until various dates between 1941 and 1945. The Red Army typically used them with laced ankle boots where the legs were insufficiently protected, though jackboots were more common.Soviet Reenactment - footwear When the British Army finally replaced battledress with the 1960 Pattern Combat Dress, ankle high puttees replaced the webbing gaiters.Smith, Digby (1977) The British Army 1965-80, Osprey Publishing, (p. 12) These continued to be worn until the 1980s. =Recent find= In 2013, the remains of two teenaged Austrian First World War soldiers were found on the Presena glacier. One of them carried a spoon tucked into his puttees, apparently a common practice amongst soldiers eating out of communal pots. \\"The Blue Puttees\\" and \\"The Glamour Boys\\" National War Memorial in Ottawa depicts Canadian Army infantrymen from World War I wearing puttees Two current Canadian infantry regiments were given nicknames based on non-standard leg wear: the Royal Newfoundland Regiment and the 48th Highlanders of Canada. At the outbreak of World War I the Dominion of Newfoundland raised a regiment for active service. Lacking a local militia or garrison of soldiers, there were no military stores; uniforms had to be fashioned from scratch. In the absence of khaki broadcloth, puttees were fashioned from blue broadcloth. The Newfoundland Regiment was thus nicknamed \\"The Blue Puttees\\". This distinctive feature was retained for several months until the regiment was issued with standard British Army uniform and equipment upon arrival in England.Rene Chartrand, p46 \\"The Canadian Corps in World War I\\", During World War II, 1 Brigade of the 1st Canadian Division was being inspected by King George VI. By this date the traditional knee-length puttees had been replaced with short ankle-length leggings worn with battledress. There were not enough khaki leggings for issue, so the 48th Highlanders made do with unofficial blue ones reportedly cut down from stocks of blue cloth found in regimental stores. The King inquired as to why the 48th wore different \\"puttees\\" from the rest of the brigade. Upon being told of the shortage, the king replied that he liked the blue puttees better and that they should keep them. The 48th Highlanders continued to wear blue puttees until the regimental service dress was eventually phased out. Reportedly other regiments nicknamed them as \\"The Glamour Boys\\" for this distinctive form of legging.

In local lore she is known as a \\"Prostitute with a heart of gold\\" and the \\"Patron Saint of Murray\\".  Biography Hall was born in Dublin, Ireland, to an English Protestant father and an Irish Catholic mother, both of whom were well educated. They ensured their daughter was also well educated. She could recite Shakespeare, Dante and John Milton. Hall felt confined in Ireland and, despite her parents begging her not to, she sailed for America to seek her fortune. She arrived in New York City in 1873. Once there, she started working as a barmaid. Soon, she met a wealthy young man named Burdan and agreed to marry. Hall wanted a Catholic marriage, but Burdan wanted to marry immediately. He woke a city official who promptly married them. Burdan thought Maggie too common a name for the wife of a man in his position, so she changed her name to Molly. The marriage was kept a secret from Burdan's father who would not approve and gave his son a generous monthly allowance. The father eventually found out and cut Burdan off. =Prostitution= Without any income, and now in debt, Burdan tried to talk his wife into prostitution. She eventually, and reluctantly, agreed. Feeling guilt for her actions, she went to Confession, but instead of receiving forgiveness, she was excommunicated from the Catholic Church. With her husband making more demands on her, and her love for him fading, in around 1877, Hall left her husband to work solely for her own rewards. She travelled to Chicago, Virginia City, Nevada, San Francisco and Portland, Oregon, increasing her charges as she went. At one stage she was reputed to be the mistress of a millionaire. During this time she built up an expensive wardrobe. =Murray= In 1884, after hearing about the gold strikes in the Coeur d'Alene Mountains, she headed to Idaho. Whilst heading there on a train, she met Calamity Jane, although their paths diverged at Thompson Falls, Montana. Hall brought a horse and joined a pack train heading to Murray, Idaho. On the way, the train encountered a blizzard while in Thompson Pass. She noticed a woman and child struggling in the snow, so took them and found shelter for the night whilst the train carried on its journey. When they arrived in Murray the day after the train, word of her actions had spread and she was admired by the townsfolk. In Murray, Hall met a man named Philip O'Rourke and the two became longtime friends. O'Rourke helped her to find a cabin in Paradise Row where she set up a brothel. Hall gained the nickname Molly B'Damn in Murray. In some accounts, this originated from O'Rourke misshearing her when she told him her name; Molly Burdan (her married name). In other accounts, she gained the nickname from her colorful language. On miner's payday, Hall would fill a bathtub with water in the alley behind the brothel and invite miners to throw gold dust in it. When enough had been thrown in, she would strip off and bathe in the tub. For extra gold dust, the miners could help wash her. Hall was known for her kindness and charity. She would home the homeless, feed the hungry and nurse the sick. Murray had only one doctor. When the town was affected by smallpox in 1886, Hall rallied the town into setting up makeshift hospitals and led the nursing of the sick. =Death= Hall contracted tuberculosis in October 1887 and died on January 27, 1888, aged 34. O'Rourke was at her bedside. The community pulled all their curtains shut and the bars, gambling dens and surrounding mines shut down for her funeral. The service was given by a Methodist minister as the Catholic priest refused. At her own request she was buried as Maggie Hall in Murray Cemetery. Her tombstone erroneously gives her age as 35.  Legacy  Hall's legendary compassion led the citizens of Murray to name their annual city celebration the \\"Molly B'Damn Gold Rush Days\\" in her honor. They have trouble casting the role of Molly B'Damn as there are no known photographs of her. The Sprag Pole Museum located in Murray features a reconstruction of her bedroom as one of the exhibits.

It is located in the city of Rio de Janeiro, where it is installed in the Paço de São Cristóvão (Saint Christopher's Palace), which is inside the Quinta da Boa Vista. The main building was originally the residence of the Portuguese Royal Family between 1808 and 1821 and was later used to house the Brazilian Imperial Family between 1822 and 1889. After the monarchy was deposed, it hosted the Republican Constituent Assembly from 1889 to 1891 before being assigned to the use of the museum in 1892. The building was listed as Brazilian National Heritage in 1938 and was largely destroyed by a fire in 2018. Founded by King João VI of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves on 6 June 1818, under the name of \\"Royal Museum\\", the institution was initially housed at the Campo de Santana park, where it exhibited the collections incorporated from the former House of Natural History, popularly known as Casa dos Pássaros (\\"House of the Birds\\"), created in 1784 by the Viceroy of Brazil, , as well as collections of mineralogy and zoology. The museum foundation was intended to address the interests of promoting the socioeconomic development of the country by the diffusion of education, culture, and science. In the 19th century, the institution was already established as the most important South American museum of its type. In 1946, it was incorporated into the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. The National Museum held a vast collection with more than 20 million objects, one of the largest collections of natural history and anthropological artifacts in the world, encompassing some of the most important material records regarding natural science and anthropology in Brazil, as well as numerous items that came from other regions of the world and were produced by several cultures and ancient civilizations. Built-up over more than two centuries through expeditions, excavations, acquisitions, donations and exchanges, the collection was subdivided into seven main nuclei: geology, paleontology, botany, zoology, biological anthropology, archaeology, and ethnology. The collection was the principal basis for the research conducted by the academic departments of the museumwhich are responsible for carrying out activities in all the regions of the Brazilian territory and several places of the world, including the Antarctic continent. The museum holds one of the largest scientific libraries of Brazil, with over 470,000 volumes and 2,400 rare works. In the area of education, the museum offers specializations, extension and post-graduation courses in several fields of the knowledge, in addition to hosting temporary and permanent exhibitions and educational activities open to the general public. The museum manages the Horto Botânico (Botanical Garden), adjacent to the Paço de São Cristóvão, as well as an advanced campus in the city of Santa Teresa, in Espírito Santothe Santa Lúcia Biological Station, jointly managed with the Museum of Biology Prof. Mello Leitão. A third site, located in the city of Saquarema, is used as a support and logistics center for field activities. Finally, the museum is also dedicated to editorial production, outstanding in that field the Archivos do Museu Nacional, the oldest scientific journal of Brazil, continuously published since 1876. The palace, which housed a large part of the collection, was destroyed in a fire on the night of 2 September 2018. The building had been called a \\"firetrap\\" by critics, who argued the fire was predictable and could have been prevented. The fire began in the air-conditioning system of the auditorium on the ground floor. One of the three devices did not have external grounding, there was no individual circuit breaker for each of them, and a wire was without insulation in contact with metal. In the wake of the fire, the ruined edifice is being treated as an archaeological site and undergoing reconstruction efforts, with a metallic roof covering a 5,000 m² area including debris. In 2019, more than 30,000 pieces of the Imperial Family's past were found during archaeological works on Rio de Janeiro Zoological Garden nearby, part of Quinta da Boa Vista. Among the finds are many items such as fragments of crockery, cups, plates, cutlery, horseshoes and even buttons and brooches with imperial coat of arms from military clothing. Those items were given to the museum. After being destroyed by fire, the National Museum has received donations to the amount of R$ 1.1 million in seven months towards rebuilding efforts. The financial help is expected more from international influences than from the local Brazilian population.  History  Imperial Palace that housed the National Museum The National Museum was officially established by King João VI of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves (1769–1826) in 1818 with the name Royal Museum, in an initiative to stimulate scientific research in the Kingdom of Brazil, then a constituent part of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves. Initially, the museum housed plant and animal specimens, especially birds, which caused it to be known by locals n as the \\"House of the Birds\\". After the marriage of King João VI's eldest son and Brazil's first Emperor, Dom Pedro I (1798–1834), to H.I. & R.H. Archduchess Maria Leopoldina of Austria (1797–1826), the Museum started to attract some of the greatest European naturalists of the 19th century, such as Maximilian zu Wied-Neuwied (1782–1867), Johann Baptist von Spix (1781–1826), and Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius (1794–1868). Other European researchers who explored the country, such as Augustin Saint-Hilaire (1799–1853) and the Baron von Langsdorff (1774–1852), contributed to the collections of the Royal Museum. By the end of the 19th century, reflecting the personal preferences of His Imperial Majesty Emperor Pedro II (1825–1891), the National Museum started to invest in the areas of the anthropology, paleontology and archaeology. The Emperor himself, who was an avid amateur scientist and enthusiastic supporter of all branches of science, contributed with several of the collections of the art of Ancient Egypt, botanical fossils, etc., which he acquired during many of his trips abroad. In this way, the National Museum was modernized and became the most important museum of natural history and human sciences of South America. Edmund Roberts visited the museum in 1832, noting that the museum only had three open rooms at that time, and that the closed rooms were \\"sadly plundered of its contents by Don Pedro.\\" The National Museum at its first location in Campo de Sant'Anna, today's Praça da República, ca. 1870 Sala Spix, D. Pedro II was well aware of the shortage of true scientists and naturalists in Brazil. He fixed this problem by inviting foreign scientists to come to work at the Museum. The first to come was Ludwig Riedel (1761–1861), a German botanist who had participated in Baron von Langsdorff's famed expedition to Mato Grosso from 1826 to 1828. Other scientists to come were German chemist Theodor Peckolt and American geologist and paleontologist Charles Frederick Hartt (1840–1878). In the following years, the museum gradually became known so it continued to attract several foreign scientists who wished to achieve scientific stature with their work in Brazil, such as Fritz Müller (1821–1897), Hermann von Ihering (1850–1930), Carl August Wilhelm Schwacke (1848–1894), Orville Adalbert Derby (1851–1915), Émil August Goeldi (1859–1917), Louis Couty (1854–1884) and others; all of them were fired by museum director Ladislau Netto when the Emperor was deposed. The Emperor was a very popular figure when he was deposed by a military coup in 1889, so the republicans tried to erase the symbols of the Empire. One of these symbols, the Paço de São Cristóvão, the official residence of the emperors in the Quinta da Boa Vista, became vacant; therefore, in 1892, the National Museum, with all its collections, valuables and researchers, was transferred to this palace, where it stays until today. In 1946, the museum's management was passed to the University of Brazil, currently the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. The researchers and their offices and laboratories occupy a good part of the palace and other buildings erected at Botanical Gardens (Horto Florestal), in the Quinta da Boa Vista park – one of the largest scientific libraries of Rio. The National Museum offers graduate courses in the following areas: anthropology, sociology, botany, geology, paleontology, and zoology. It was presented as a Lego Idea.  Former collections  Bendegó meteorite, which survived the fire The museum sheltered one of the largest exhibits of the Americas, prior to the fire, consisting of animals, insects, minerals, aboriginal collections of utensils, Egyptian mummies and South American archaeological artifacts, meteorites, fossils and many other findings. One of the meteorites that was on display is the Bendegó meteorite, which weighs over and was discovered in 1784. = Archaeology = The collection of archaeology of the National Museum comprised more than 100,000 objects, covering distinct several civilizations that lived in the Americas, Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, since the Paleolithic Age until the 19th century. The collection is subdivided into four main segments: Ancient Egypt, Mediterranean cultures, Pre-Columbian archaeology, and Pre-Columbian Brazil last nucleus, systematically gathered since 1867, is the largest segment of the archaeological collection, as well as the most important collection of its typology in the world, covering the history of Pre-Cabraline Brazil in a very comprehensive manner and sheltering some of the most important material records related to Brazilian archaeology. It was, therefore, a collection of considerable scientific value, and object of several works of basic research, theses, dissertations, and monographs.  Ancient Egypt  Sarcophagus and mummy of Sha-Amun-en-su. Third Intermediate Period, XXIII Dynasty, . With more than 700 items, the collection of Egyptian archaeology of the National Museum was one of the largest of Latin America and one of the oldest in the Americas. Most part of the objects entered the museum collection in 1826, when the tradesman Nicolau Fiengo brought from Marseille an assemblage of Egyptian antiquities that belonged to the famous Italian explorer Giovanni Battista Belzoni, who had been in charge of excavating the Theban Necropolis (modern-day Luxor) and the Temple of Karnak. This collection had Argentina as the initial destination, and had probably been ordered by the president of that country, Bernardino Rivadavia, creator of the University of Buenos Aires and a noted enthusiast of museums. However, a naval blockade at the La Plata River would impede Fiengo from completing his journey, forcing him to return from Montevideo to Rio de Janeiro, where the pieces were offered at an auction. Emperor Pedro I bought the entire collection for five million réis, and subsequently donated it to the National Museum. It has been suggested that the action of Pedro I would have been influenced by José Bonifácio de Andrada, a relevant early member of Freemasonry in Brazil, perhaps driven by the interest that the organization had for the Egyptian iconography. The collection started by Pedro I would be expanded by his son, emperor Pedro II, an amateur Egyptologist and notable collector of archaeological and ethnographic artifacts. One of the most important additions to the Egyptian collection of the National Museum made by Pedro II is the polychromed wood sarcophagus of the singer of Amun, Sha-Amun- en-su, from the Late Period, offered to the emperor as a gift during his second trip to Egypt, in 1876, by the Khedive Ismail Pasha. The sarcophagus is distinguished for its rarity, since it is one of few examples that have never been opened, still preserving the mummy of the singer in its interior. The collection would be enriched through other acquisitions and donations, becoming, at the beginning of the 20th-century, sufficiently relevant to draw the attention of international researchers and Egyptologists, such as Alberto Childe, who served as conservator of the Department of Archaeology of the museum between 1912 and 1938 and was also responsible for publishing the Guide of the Collections of Classical Archaeology of the National Museum, in 1919. Egyptian mummy (\\"Princess Kherima\\"). Roman Period, 1st–3rd centuries AD. Besides the aforementioned coffin of Sha-Amun-en-su, the museum possesses other three sarcophagi, from the Third Intermediate Period and the Late Era, belonging to three priests of Amun: Hori, Pestjef, and Harsiese. The museum also conserves six human mummies (four adults and two children), as well as a number of mummies and sarcophagi of animals (cats, ibises, fishes, and crocodiles). Among the human examples, the highlight is a mummy of a woman from the Roman Period, which is considered extremely rare for the preparatory technique used, of which there are only eight similar examples worldwide. Called \\"princess of the Sun\\" or \\"princess Kherima\\", the mummy has her members and fingers of the hands and feet individually swaddled and is richly adorned, with painted strips. \\"Princess Kherima\\" is one of the most popular items of the National Museum collection, being even related to accounts of parapsychological experiences and collective trances, that supposedly occurred in the 1960s. \\"Kherima\\" also inspired the romance The Secret of the Mummy by Everton Ralph, member of the Rosicrucian society. The collection of votive and funerary steles is composed of dozens of pieces dated, in their majority, from the Intermediate Period and the Late Era. The steles of Raia and Haunefer, which are graved with titles of Semitic origins present in the Bible and in the tablets of Mari, stand out, as well as an unfinished stele, attributed to the emperor Tiberius, of the Roman Period. The museum also had a vast collection of shabtis, i.e. statuettes representing funerary servers, including a group of pieces that belonged to pharaoh Seti I, excavated from his tomb at the Valley of the Kings. The rare artifacts included a limestone statue of a young woman, dated of the New Kingdom, carrying a conic ointment vessel on the top of her headan iconography that is almost exclusively found among paintings and reliefs. The collection also includes fragments of reliefs, masks, statues of deities in bronze, stone and wood (such as representations of Ptah-Sokar-Osiris), canopic jars, alabaster bowls, funerary cones, jewels, and amulets.

Greek civilization, . The collection of classical archaeology of the National Museum added up to around 750 pieces and consists mostly of Greek, Roman, Etruscan, and Italiote objects, being the largest collection of its kind in Latin America. Most of the pieces previously belonged to the Greco-Roman collection of empress Teresa Cristina, who had been interested in archaeology since her youth. When the empress disembarked in Rio de Janeiro in 1843, right after her proxy wedding to emperor Pedro II, she brought an assemblage of antiquities found during the excavations of Herculaneum and Pompeii, the Ancient Roman cities destroyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD. Part of this collection had also belonged to Carolina Murat, sister of Napoleon Bonaparte and queen consort of the king of Naples, Joachim Murat. In turn, Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies, brother of empress Teresa Cristina, had ordered the excavations of Herculaneum and Pompeii, initiated in the 18th century, be resumed. The recovered pieces were sent to the Royal Bourbon Museum of Naples. Aiming to increase the number of classical artifacts in Brazil with a view to the future creation of a museum of Greco-Roman archaeology in the country, the empress established formal exchanges with the Kingdom of Naples. She requested the shipment of Greco-Roman objects to Rio de Janeiro, while sending artifacts of indigenous origins to Italy. The empress also personally financed excavations in Veios, an Etruscan archeological site located fifteen kilometers north of Rome, thus enabling a large part of the objects found there to be brought to Brazil. A greater part of those had been gathered between 1853 and 1859, but Teresa Cristina continued to enrich the collection until the fall of the Brazilian empire in 1889, when the Republic was proclaimed and the empress left the country with all the royal family. Temple of Isis, representing a sea dragon and a dolphin, 1st century AD (Fourth Style) Among the highlights of the collection were a set of four frescos from Pompeii, made around the 1st century AD. Two of those are decorated with marine motifs, respectively depicting a sea dragon and a seahorse as the central figure surrounded by dolphins, and had adorned the lower walls of the room of the devotees at the Temple of Isis. The other two frescos are decorated with representations of plants, birds, and landscapes, stylistically close to the paintings of Herculaneum and Stabiae. The museum also housed a large number of objects from Pompeii portraying the daily life of Ancient Roman citizens: fibulae, jewels, mirrors, and other pieces of the Roman female toilette, glass and bronze vessels, phallic amulets, oil lamps molded in terracotta, etc. The collection of Mediterranean pottery comprised more than dozens of objects and is noted for the diversity of origins, shapes, decorations and utilitarian purposes. Several of the most important styles and schools of classical antiquity are represented, from the Corinthian geometric style of the 7th century BC to the Roman terracotta amphoras of the Early Christian era. The museum houses examples of kraters, oenochoai, kantharos, chalices, kyathos, cups, hydriai, lekythoi, askoi, and lekanides. The groups of Etruscan Bucchero pottery (7th–4th centuries BC), Greek black-figure vases (7th–5th centuries BC), Gnathian vessels (4th century BC), and the vast set of Italian red-figure vases, with ceramics from Apulia, Campania, Lucania and Magna Graecia, which also stand out. The collection of sculptures comprised a large number of Tanagra figurines, small terracotta sculptures of Greek origin that were widely appreciated in the Ancient world, as well as a group of Etruscan bronze statuettes representing warriors and female figures. The collection of military artifacts included entire pieces or fragments of helmets, maces, scabbards, bronze blades, brooches and phalleras. File:Torso nu (Vênus ou Leda) 01.jpgVenus or Leda.

Anthropomorphic ceramic figurine, 500–1200 AD The National Museum housed an important group of about 1,800 artifacts produced by the Indigenous peoples of the Americas during the Pre- Columbian era, as well as Andean mummies. Gathered throughout the 19th century, the collection was based on holdings of the Brazilian royal family, with several objects coming from the private collection of Emperor Pedro II. It was later enlarged through acquisitions, donations, exchanges, and excavations. By the end of the 19th-century, the collection already had considerable prestige, being cited, on the occasion of opening the 1889 Anthropological Exposition, as one of the largest collections of South American archaeology. Peruvian Chancay culture. Fragment of textile with representation of birds. Huaca del Sol, Late Period, Shrunken head, mummified by the Ecuadorian-Peruvian Jivaroan peoples The collection comprised mostly objects related to the textile manufacturing, featherwork, ceramic production, and stonecraft of the Andean cultures (groups of Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina) and, to a lesser extent, of the Amazonian natives (including a rare assemblage of artifacts from the area of present-day Venezuela) and Mesoamerican cultures (mainly from present-day Mexico and Nicaragua). Several aspects of the daily routine, social organization, religiosity, and imagery of the Pre-Columbian civilizations are addressed in the collection, which has items from common daily use (clothing, body ornaments, weapons) to more refined artifacts, imbued with notable artistic sense (measurement and musical instruments, ritual objects, figurative ceramic sculptures and vessels distinguished for their aesthetic features). Other aspects of Pre-Columbian life, such as the dynamics of trade, ideological diffusion, and cultural influences among the groups, are also represented in the collection. Items are evaluated in terms of the similarity of decorative patterns and artistic techniques, as well as in the subjects portrayed. Common to nearly all distinct groups are such subjects as plants, nocturnal animals (bats, serpents, owls), and fantastic creatures associated to natural elements and phenomena. The best represented groups, in the context of Andean cultures, include: * Nazca culture, which flourished on the southern coast of Peru between the 1st century BC and 800 AD. The National Museum has a large set of fragments of Nazca textiles depicting animals (mainly llamas), fantastic beings, plants, and geometric patterns; * Moche civilization, which flourished on the northern coast of Peru between the early Christian era and 8th century AD, responsible for building large monuments, temples, pyramids, and ceremonial complexes, represented in the collection by a group of figurative pottery of high artistic and technical quality (zoomorphic, anthropomorphic, and globular vessels) and examples of goldsmithery; * Wari culture, which inhabited the south-central Andes since the 5th century AD, represented by anthropomorphic ceramic vessels and textile fragments; * Lambayeque culture, which arose in the homonymous region of Peru during the 8th century AD, exemplified in the collection through textiles, pottery and metalwork; * Chimú culture, which flourished on the Valley of the Moche River since the 10th century AD, represented by a group of zoomorphic and anthropomorphic pottery (characteristically dark, obtained through the technique of reducing burning, and inspired by stylistic elements of the Moche and Wari cultures), as well as textiles decorated with varying motifs; * Chancay culture, which developed between the Intermediate and Late periods (from about 1000 to 1470 AD), on the valleys of the rivers Chancay and Chillon, presented in the collection by a set of anthropomorphic pottery (characteristically dark, decorated with light- colored engobe and brown painting) and sophisticated textiles depicting animals and vegetablesnamely a large mantle, with three meters of length; * Inca civilization, which flourished around the 13th century AD and became the largest empire of the Pre-Columbian Americas in the following century. The National Museum possesses a set of figurative pottery and vessels decorated with geometric patterns (\\"Incan aryballos\\"), miniature figures of human beings and llamas, made with alloys of gold, silver, and copper, miniatures of Inca ceremonial clothing, featherwork, quipus, mantles, tunics, and several other examples of textiles. The collection of Andean mummies of the National Museum allows a glimpse at the funerary practices of the cultures of the region. The mummies of the collection were preserved either naturally (as a result of the favorable geo-climatic conditions of the Andean Mountains) or artificially, in the context of religious and ritualistic practices. Originating from Chiu Chiu, at the Atacama Desert, northern Chile, there is a mummy of a man with an estimated age of 3,400 to 4,700 years, preserved in a seated position, with the head resting on the knees and covered by a wool cap. This was the position which the Atacaman cultures used to sleep, due to the cold climate of the desert. It was also the position in which they were buried, together with their belongings. A second mummy in the collectionan Aymara man, found in the surroundings of Lake Titicaca, between Peru and Boliviais preserved in the same position, but involved in a funerary bundle. The collection of mummies also include a boy, donated by the Chilean government, and, illustrating the techniques of artificial mummification of Pre-Columbian cultures, an example of a shrunken head, coming from the Jivaroan peoples of equatorial Amazon, of ritualistic purposes.

Anthropomorphic funerary urn, 400–1400 AD The collection of Brazilian archaeology of the National Museum brought together a vast set of artifacts produced by the cultures that flourished in the Brazilian territory during the pre-colonial era, with more than 90,000 objects. It was considered the largest collection in its typology worldwide. Gradually assembled since the early 19th century, the collection started being systematically gathered since 1867 and has been continually expanded until the present day, through excavations, acquisitions and donations, also serving as basis for a large number of research projects conducted by the academics of the museum, the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, and other institutions. It was composed of objects coming from all regions of Brazil, establishing a timeline spanning more than 10,000 years. From the oldest inhabitants of the Brazilian territory (horticulturists and hunter-gatherer groups), the museum preserved several artifacts made of stone (flint, quartz and other minerals) and bones, such as projectile points used for hunting, axe blades of polished stone and other tools used for carving, scraping, cleaving, triturating, and piercing, in addition to artifacts of ceremonial use and adornments. Although objects made of wood, fiber, and resin were also produced, the majority of them didn't stand the test of time and are almost absent in the collection, except for some individual piecesnamely a woven straw basket covered by resin, only partially preserved, found in the southern coast of Brazil. In the segment regarding the Sambaqui people, i.e. the fishing and gathering communities which lived in the south-central coast of Brazil between 8,000 years before present and the early Christian era, the National Museum holds a large number of vestiges originating from deposits constituted of agglomerated lime and organic materialthe so-called Sambaquis, or middens. Two fragments of Sambaquis are preserved in the collection, in addition to a group of human skeletal remains found in these archaeological sites, as well as several cultural testimonies of the Sambaqui people, encompassing utilitarian objects used in routine tasks (vessels, bowls, pestles and mortars carved in stone), ceremonies and rituals (such as votive statuettes). Among the highlights of the Sambaqui collection, there is a large set of zoolites (stone sculptures of votive use, with representation of animals, such as fish and birds, and human figures). Santarém culture. Ceramic vessel (\\"caryatid\\" vase), 1000–1400 AD The collection included several examples of funerary urns, rattles, dishes, bowls, clothing, dresses, idols, and amulets, with emphasis being placed on ceramic objects, produced by numerous cultures of precolonial Brazil. Best represented groups in the collection include: * Marajoara culture, which flourished on Marajó island, at the mouth of the Amazon River, between the 5th and the 15th centuries, considered the group that reached the highest level of social complexity in precolonial Brazil. The museum has a vast assemblage of Marajoara pottery, notable for their heightened artistic and aesthetic sense, as well as for the variety of shapes and refined decorationmostly works of figurative nature (representations of humans and animals), combined with rich geometric patterns (compositions imbued with symmetry, rhythmic repetitions, paired elements, binary oppositions, etc.) and with a predominant usage of the excision technique. Major part of the ceramic pieces are of ceremonial nature, used in funerary contexts, rites of passage, etc. Among the highlights, it's possible to mention the anthropomorphic statuettes (particularly the phallus- shaped female figurines, uniting the male and female principles, a recurring theme of the Marajoara art), large-scale funerary urns, anthropomorphic vases with geometric decoration, ritual thongs, zoomorphic, anthropomorphic and hybrid vessels, etc. * Santarém culture (or Tapajós culture), which inhabited the region of the Tapajós River in the state of Pará, between the 5th and the 15th centuries, known for their ceramic work of peculiar style and high technical quality, produced with the techniques of modeling, incision, dotted lines, and appliqué, imbued with aesthetic features that suggest the influence of the Mesoamerican civilizations. Among the highlights of the collection were the anthropomorphic statuettes of naturalist style (characterised by the closed eyes, shaped like coffee beans), the anthropomorphic and zoomorphic vessels, vases for ceremonial use and, above all, the so-called \\"caryatid vases\\" – complex ceramic vessels, endowed with bottlenecks, reliefs and pedestals decorated with anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figurines and fantastic beings. The museum also possesses several examples of Muiraquitãs, i.e. small statuettes carved in green gems, shaped like animals (mainly frogs) used as adornments or amulets. Santarém culture. Anthropomorphic vase representing a seated man, 1000–1400 AD. * Konduri culture, which reached their apex in the 7th century and met their decline in the 15th century, and inhabited the region between the Trombetas and Nhamundá rivers, in Pará. Although this culture kept an intense contact with the Santarém culture, their artistic production developed unique features. The Konduri collection is primarily composed of pottery, noted for the techniques of decoration such as incision and dotted lines, the lively polichromy, and the reliefs with anthropomorphic and zoomorphic motifs. * Trombetas River culture, which inhabited the lower Amazon, in the state of Pará, near the region of Santarém. This culture, still largely unknown, was responsible for producing rare artifacts sculpted in polished stone and objects imbued with stylistic elements common to the Mesoamerican cultures. The museum collection preserves lithic artifacts of ceremonial use, as well as anthropomorphic and zoomorphic statuettes (zoolites representing fish and jaguars). * Miracanguera culture, which flourished on the left bank of the Amazon river, in the region between Itacoatiara and Manaus, between the 9th and the 15th centuries. The museum preserved several examples of ceremonial pottery, mainly anthropomorphic funerary urns characterized by the presence of bulges, necks, and lids, used to store the ashes of the deceased, and other vessels related to funerary rituals. The Miracanguera pottery is distinguished for the presence of tabatinga layers (clay mixed with organic materials) and the eventual painted decoration of geometric motifs. The plastic composition frequently outlines specific details, such as human figures in a seated position, with the legs represented. Trombetas River culture. Zoolite in the shape of a fish, w/d * Maracá culture, which lived in the region of Amapá between the 15th and the 18th centuries, represented in the collection by a group of typical funerary urns depicting male and female figurines in hierarchic position, with head- shaped lids, as well as zoomorphic funerary urns depicting quadrupedal animals, originating from indigenous cemeteries located in the outskirts of the Maracá River. The Maracá pottery was frequently adorned with geometric patterns and polychromed with white, yellow, red, and black pigments. Ornaments in the members and the head of the figures expressed the social identity of the deceased. * Tupi-Guaraní culture, which inhabited the Brazilian coast when the Portuguese arrived in the 16th centurysubdivided into the group of the Tupinambá people (in the North, Northeast, and Southeast regions of Brazil) and the group of the Guaraní people (in the South region of Brazil and parts of Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay). The collection is predominantly composed of ceramics and lithic artifacts of daily use (such as pans, bowls, jars, and dishes) or ritual nature (mainly funerary urns). The Tupi-Guaraní pottery is characterized by its distinct polychromy (with predominance of red, black, and white pigments) and drawings of geometric and sinuous patterns. The National Museum held the oldest known examples of indigenous mummies found in the Brazilian territory. The collection consisted of the body of an adult woman of approximately 25 years of age, and two children, one located at her feet, with an estimated age of twelve months, involved in a bundle, and a new-born, also covered by a mantle, positioned behind the head of the woman. This mummified set is composed of individuals that probably belonged to the group of the Botocudos (or Aimoré) people, of the Macro-Jê branch. They were found at the Caverna da Babilônia, a cavern located in the city of Rio Novo, interior of the state of Minas Gerais, in a farm that belonged to Maria José de Santana, who donated the mummies to emperor Pedro II. As an act of gratitude for this favor, Pedro II awarded Maria José with the title of Baroness of Santana. File:Ponta de projétil MN 01.jpgHunter-gatherer groups. Projectile point.

The budget was so low, there was US$ 0.01 to spend on each of the artifacts. The building fell into disrepair, evidenced by peeling wall material, exposed electrical wiring, and termite problem. By June 2018, the museum's 200th anniversary, it had reached a state of near-complete abandonment. There was an offer from the World Bank to purchase the museum for US$80 m, which was turned down because the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro would have to give up ownership. According to the dean of UFRJ Denise Pires de Carvalho, the university does not have the money to pay bills of light delayed since January 2019, of water since 2 years, of security and cleaning services. She also said that although they do not have any more money available, she would seek the release of 20% of the R$43 million released by the parliamentary bench in Rio de Janeiro to continue the reconstruction works of the National Museum. It aims to reopen at least one wing of the palace in 2022, the year of independence bicentennial.  2018 fire  The building was heavily damaged by a large fire which began about 19:30 local time (23:30 UTC) on 2 September 2018. Although some items were saved, it is believed that 92.5% of its archive of 20 million items were destroyed in the fire, though circa 1.5 million items are stored in a separate building, which were not damaged. First responders fighting the fire were hindered by a lack of water. Rio's fire chief claimed that two nearby fire hydrants had insufficient water, leaving firefighters to resort to pumping water from a nearby lake. According to a CEDAE () employee, although the hydrants did have water, the water pressure was very low, due to the fact that the building is on top of a hill. Brazil President Michel Temer claimed the loss due to the fire to be \\"incalculable.\\" = Background = Museum Deputy Director Luiz Fernando Dias Daniel pointed to neglect by successive governments as a cause of the fire, saying that curators \\"fought with different governments to get adequate resources to preserve what is now completely destroyed\\" and that he felt \\"total dismay and immense anger.\\" The museum lacked a fire sprinkler system, although there were smoke detectors and a few fire extinguishers. The museum did not receive the R$520,000 per year necessary for its maintenance since 2014, and it closed temporarily in 2015 when cleaning and security staff could no longer be paid. Repairs to a popular exhibit hall had to be crowd-funded, and the museum's maintenance budget had been cut by 90 per cent by 2018. There were visible signs of decay before the fire, such as peeling walls and exposed wiring. The museum celebrated its 200th anniversary in June 2018 in a situation of partial abandonment. No state ministers attended the occasion. alt=Photograph of the museum fire lighting the night sky at the end of a long, dark street lined with vehicles at either side = Fire = A large fire broke out shortly after the museum closed on 2 September 2018, reaching all three floors of the building. Firefighters were called at 19:30 local time (22:30 UTC) and arrived quickly at the scene. However, the fire chief reported that the two fire hydrants closest to the museum had no water, and trucks had to be sent to a nearby lake. According to the spokesman for the fire department, the fire crews went inside the burning building to rescue artifacts, despite there being no people inside, and they were able to remove items with the help of museum staff. The fire was out of control by 21:00 (00:00 UTC 3 September), with great flames and occasional explosions, being fought by firefighters from four sectors. Dozens of people went to Quinta da Boa Vista to see the fire. A specialized team of firefighters entered the building at 21:15 to block areas still not hit by the flames and to evaluate the extent of the damage. However, by 21:30, the whole building had been engulfed by the fire, including exhibitions of Imperial rooms that were in the two areas at the front of the main building. The four security guards who were on duty at the museum managed to escape; first reports stated that there were no casualties, although a firefighter suffered burns to the fingers while trying to rescue the Luzia’s fossil. Two fire engines were used with turntable ladders, with two water trucks taking turns to supply water. The Brazilian Marine Corps also provided fire engines, water trucks, and a decontamination unit from a nearby base. Pictures on social media showed artifacts being rescued from the burning building by firefighters and civilians. At 22:00 (01:00 UTC 3 September), dozens of museum employees joined the fight against the flames. Two floors of the building were already destroyed by this time, and the roof had collapsed. Brazilian Culture Minister Sérgio Sá Leitão suggested that it was probably caused by either an electric fault or by a sky lantern accidentally landing on the building. = Damage to collection = Paço de São Cristóvão following the fire. A building area of 13600 m² with 122 rooms was destroyed. The building was started on 1803 with luso-lebanese Elie Antun Lubbus. According to museum officials, approximately 92.5 percent of the collection has been destroyed. The building was uninsured. A spokesman for the fire department reported that pieces had been recovered from the blaze, due to efforts from firefighters and workers from the museum. Information about the condition of pieces that had been displayed started being reported as early as late 2 September, when the images of items had been shared. One of these was a Roman fresco from Pompeii that had survived the eruption of Vesuvius, but was lost in the fire. Preservation director of the museum João Carlos Nara told reporters that \\"very little will be left\\" and that they would \\"have to wait until the firefighters have completed their work here in order to really assess the scale of it all.\\" The next day, firefighters began more salvage work inside the museum, trying to rescue what they could from beneath the charred remains of the collapsed roof. The collection relating to indigenous languages is believed to have been completely destroyed, including the recordings since 1958, the chants in all the extinct languages, the Curt Nimuendajú archives (papers, photos, negatives, the original ethnic-historic-linguistic map localizing all the ethnic groups in Brazil, the only extant record from 1945), and the ethnological and archaeological references of all ethnic groups in Brazil since the 16th century. One of the linguistic researchers, Bruna Franchetto, who returned only to see her office as a pile of ash, criticised the fact that a project to back up the collection digitally had only just received funding and barely started, asking for any student who had ever come to the museum to scan or photocopy things for projects to send a copy back. The fire destroyed the museum's collection of thousands of indigenous artifacts from the country's pre-Columbian Indo-American culture. The items include many indigenous peoples' remains as well as relics amassed in the personal collection of Pedro II. This collection also featured items from present native tribes, including \\"striking feather art by the Karajá people\\". There are only about 3,000 Karajá people left. Indigenous people expressed anger that there was no money given to a museum with indigenous history but \\"the city had recently managed to find a huge budget to build a brand new Museum of Tomorrow\\". Cira Gonda also confirmed shortly after the fire that the indigenous linguistics collected had been completely destroyed, and so that original recordings of spoken word and song in dead languages have been lost, as well as other artifacts including those detailing the land and language distribution of tribes in Brazil. = Surviving items = The burned facade. Some items survived the fire. The Bendegó meteorite from the museum's collection of meteorites, which is the biggest iron meteorite ever found in Brazil, was unscathed, due to its inherent fire-resistance. From images and video of salvage after the fire, at least three other meteorites also survived undamaged. Another meteorite called Angra dos Reis was rediscovered among the debris. The meteorite is worth R$ 3 million and was lost in the rubble of the National Museum. With a mass 76 thousand times smaller than that of Bendegó, with mere 65 grams and 4 cm long, Angra dos Reis rock is the most valuable of the collection and was already the object of meteorite hunters. In more than a century of research, this fragment was divided into small portions. The biggest one was buried in the rubble of the museum. Some meteorites were found on 19 October 2018, including the Angra dos Reais, besides, burnt. In the days following the fire, firefighters recovered several portraits from the upper floor of the museum, which had been burnt, smoke and water damaged but not destroyed. Cristiana Serejo, deputy director of the museum, also said that \\"part of the zoological collection, the library and some ceramics\\" had survived. Images were shared of research microscopes, freezers, and specimen jars being collected outside of the building by museum staff during the fire, next to a rusted hydrant. During the fire, part of the Zoology department pulled out mollusks and other marine specimens, and only stopped due to the imminent danger the fire posed.Alejandro Chacoff Brazil Lost More Than the Past in the National Museum Fire The New Yorker 16 September 2018 The fire did not reach an annex of the site where vertebrate specimens were kept, but due to a loss of electricity parts of the collection could become damaged. During the salvage, an intact skull that appeared to be that of Luzia Woman was found, and sent to a nearby scientific laboratory for analysis. Due to other skulls and fragments of bones were discovered in the remains of the building prompting a need for lab testing on the found items. On 19 October 2018, it was announced that the Luzia skull indeed was found however as many fragments, which 80% were identified as being part of the frontal (forehead and nose), side, bones that are more resistant and the fragment of a femur that also belonged to the fossil and was stored. A part of the box where Luiza's skull was, was also recovered. Though the assembly of them was postponed. The bones became white, because the earth along them were burned. A portion of the museum's collection, specifically the herbarium, and fish and reptile species, was housed elsewhere and has not been affected. There was also a large scientific library within the museum, containing thousands of rare works. People on social media were reported to have found burnt pages from the library in the nearby streets; it was later confirmed that the library proper is housed in an adjacent building and was mostly undamaged. Some burnt pages, of unknown origin, were recovered by security guards. Nine Torah scrolls from the 15th century had previously been on display but were in the library at the time and survived. = Reactions = Picture shows funerary vases destroyed Brazil's president, Michel Temer, said that \\"the loss of the National Museum is incalculable for Brazil. Today is a tragic day for our country's museology. Two hundred years of work, research and knowledge were lost. The value of our history cannot be measured now, due to the damage to the building that housed the Royal Family during the Empire. It is a sad day for all Brazilians.\\" His statement was echoed by Rio Mayor Marcelo Crivella, who called for rebuilding stating: \\"It's a national obligation to reconstruct it from the ashes, recompose every detail of the paintings and photos. Even if they are not original, they will continue to be a reminder of the royal family that gave us independence, the empire and the first constitution and national unity\\". The archaeologist Zahi Hawass says that the tragedy legitimizes the movement for the repatriation of Egyptian objects in museums around the world and that if museums are not able to guarantee the safety and conservation of the objects, the archaeologist argues that to be returned to the native land. Although the collection of the National Museum was not targeted by Egyptian archaeologists, Hawass says that the destruction of the collection strengthens the movement for the repatriation of objects and that UNESCO observes countries with overseas collections and overseas museums to control them, to ensure that objects are properly protected and restored. French President Emmanuel Macron expressed his condolences on Twitter at the event. He offered to send experts to help rebuild the museum. Brazilian environmentalist and politician Marina Silva called the fire \\"a lobotomy of the Brazilian memory\\". News of the fire quickly spread through the city of Rio de Janeiro, and protesters turned up at the gates in the early hours of Monday morning. Initial reports suggested that there were 500 people, forming a chain around the still-smoking building. Some of the protesters tried to climb over fencing into the museum grounds; the police who were called to attend, in full riot gear, threw tear gas bombs into the crowds. The public were later allowed to enter the grounds. A group of Museum Studies students from the Federal University of the State of Rio de Janeiro called for the public to send in any photographs or videos of the destroyed collections. Their appeal received 14,000 videos, photos, and drawings of the museum's exhibitions within hours. = Cultural institutions = The president of the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage, Kátia Bogéa, said that \\"It's a national and worldwide tragedy. Everybody can see that this is not a loss for the Brazilian people, but for the whole humanity\\" and commented that it was \\"a predictable tragedy, because we've known for a long time that Brazilian cultural heritage has no budget\\". Museums around the world sent their condolences. In the UK, the British Library said \\"our hearts go out to the staff and users of [the National Museum] of Brazil\\" and called the fire \\"a reminder of the fragility and preciousness of our shared global heritage\\"; London's Natural History Museum, the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, and the Smithsonian Institution were among other institutions expressing their sorrow. The head of the Australian Museum said that she was \\"shocked\\", \\"devastated\\", and \\"distraught\\". Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities expressed both solidarity with the museum and concern over the status of more than 700 ancient Egyptian artifacts that were housed in the building. It offered to send experts, if requested by the Brazilian government, to assist the National Museum in restoring the damaged pieces. = Salvage efforts = On 12 September 2018, work began to implement a plan to temporarily shelter and work with what is currently the ruins of the museum: * Wooden structures, including a metallic wall, completely surrounding the São Cristovão Palace to protect what remains of the building, * Containment measures for the building to avoid risk of landslide, * An improvised roof to protect against rain water, * Modules and containers outside to serve as temporary research laboratory space. For this plan, the Brazilian government offered R$9 million as an emergency budget which has since been received by the museum. The company, Concrejato, is contracted to reinstall the walls of the building at a cost of R$8,998,075.66. and Unesco says that the reconstruction would take 10 years to get ready. Researchers are recreating 300 parts of the collection of the National Museum, including the skull of Luzia, with 3D printers. The studies are being resumed in a laboratory of the National Institute of Technology (INT), by master's and doctoral students of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. A digitally scanned page from the museum's Brazilian ethnology archives The museum is still doing some festivals called Museu Nacional Vive or Museum lives to public in tents mounted in front of current under construction improvements to the burned headquarters, with exposition of fossils, living snakes and taxidermied animals like Pterosaurs and Armadillo among others. The museum would do a permanent exposition outside. By some estimates, it would take R$100 million to rebuild the main dependencies. With the exception of a few metal cabinets intact, there are only charred fragments. Around 80% of the roof and 60% of the floors have been affected. The one million euro aid announced by Germany would allow the installation of laboratories for analysis of archaeological finds. The museum director said there is a collective effort to rebuild the collection, pursue research, and plan the reconstruction of the institution housing six major graduate programs. He reported that classes, thesis defenses and dissertations were resumed and knowledge production did not stop. \\"The National Museum has lost part of its collection but has not lost the ability to create knowledge and do science,\\" said the director. The social anthropology library, one of the most important in Latin America and totally destroyed by the fire, has received a considerable amount of donations, including the personal library of Rio de Janeiro researcher Gilberto Velho (1945–2012), who was dean of the Department of Anthropology of the museum until his death. Museum zoologists have already gone to the field to collect new specimens in an attempt to repopulate the invertebrate collection, one of the richest (with 5 million copies only in the case of insects) and harder hit by the fire. Before a revamped headquarters is available, Kellner said the museum's intention is to re-display its collection – still considerable – to the public. There is a collective funding campaign to allow the institution's loan back to schools and the plan to revitalize the museum's botanical garden so that it houses a small exhibition that would receive visitors again. \\"It would be an illusion, even a frivolous thing, to say that the old collection will be reconstituted, but we will continue to fulfill our role,\\" said the director. It was also informed they plan to keep part of ruins as historical exposition with a high modern structure of equipment inside. According to UFJR dean Roberto Leher, the facade and the exterior of the National Museum is to be preserved in the reconstruction works, but the building could be different. The recovery of the building will take into account a new concept of architecture. The cost would still depend on the concept of the museum. Technicians focus are on 3D modeling and a term of reference. New materials with low-carbon, energy-less, environmentally friendly will be used because it is a science museum. IPHAN has endorsed (since the property is overturned) to do the reconstruction taking this model into account. The new project could be with high roof space or with more slabs, depending the approval of R$100 million or € 22,610,000,00 in the budget of 2019. In 7 May 2019, the museum presented 27 small pieces found of Egypt collection. The current director took the chance to ask for more money, a minimum of R$1 million to guarantee his services further. In 14 May 2019, the statue of the Bés god about 2,350 years old was found. The piece in rock and glass paste was one of the highlights of the collection. The roof was finished on 8 June 2019, nine months after the fire. It is 23 m high sustained by 42 truss tower pillars with 30 thousand steel bars and 147 tons of total weight. Cooperation agreement with the Italian government provides for restoration of damaged parts and long-term loan of Italian parts that would be displayed in the National Museum when it is ready for reopening. Until then, the exhibition would be installed in the Sala Roma of the Consulate General of Italy, in the Center of Rio de Janeiro. The Italian Ministry of Culture would collaborate in the restoration of a Koré, an important Greek female statue, which was found in 1853 in a tomb in Italy, in which Empress Teresa of Bourbon brought dowry of her marriage to Emperor Pedro II of Brazil. However, the director denied to borrow pieces. Instead, he prefers money donations, which is denied by Italian and French governments. Samba Mangueira and Chico Buarque tries with music to help the museum in some way.  Reconstruction  During the signing of a protocol of intent for technical-scientific cooperation with the Brazilian Institute of Museums (Ibram), held on 14 May 2019, it was reported that the works of restoration of the patrimony would be initiated in 2019, with an elaborated executive project of the reconstruction of the facades and of the roof, with an endowment of R$1 million. Paulo Amaral, president of Ibram, said that the new concept of the National Museum would probably be announced in April 2020, when the final formatting of the space would be defined, with parts dedicated to the historical collection, contemporary works and equipment. On the first floor of the building was the Francisca Keller Library, which had the largest collection of anthropology and human sciences in South America. To speed up the fundraising process, they are making a crowdfunding campaign on the Benfeitoria platform. The money would be used for the demolition of the interior walls of the space, restoring the floor, finishing and painting, laying the ceiling, making the electrical and air conditioning installation and the restoration of hardware. They expect to get R$129,000 by 12 September 2019. The Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, responsible for the museum, signed on Saturday 31 August 2019 a memorandum of understanding with the Vale Foundation, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the BNDES to create a governance steering committee that can lead the museum's recovery project. Vale provides R$50 million and BNDES R$21.7 million for this reconstruction. The Ministry of Education had allocated R$16 million to the National Museum. Of this total, R$8.9 million was used in emergency works, and the rest for facade and roof projects. The Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovations and Communications contributed R$10 million to acquire equipment for scientific research and infrastructure actions. Germany had donated 230,000 euros so far. After 1 year since the destruction, 44% of the museum's collections had been saved. More than 50 of the 70 areas hit by the fire were searched. Reconstruction of the facade and roof is expected to take place between the end of 2019 and the beginning of 2020. In the first half of 2020, the salvage of parts of the collection and the start of the inventory process are expected to be completed. R$69 million in public funds for the project. The amount is composed of R$21 million from BNDES (R$3.3 million of which have already been released), R$43 million from the amendment of the Rio de Janeiro bench in the Chamber of Deputies and R$5 million from the Ministry Education. On 3 October 2019, the museum has about 120 million reais available to make works, coming from funds from parliamentary amendments, the BNDES and Vale. But, the money cannot be used to buy the material needed to continue the rescue, only in the works. In the box of the Association Friends of the National Museum, there are 80 thousand reais in cash, coming from donations, but only R$25 thousand are not yet committed. The Rio de Janeiro Legislative Assembly (Alerj) donated R$20 million to help in the works. Funding are available as project steps are completed.  Donations  Drawings showing ancient vases *The German Foreign Ministry has offered €1 million in aid to rebuild Brazil's National Museum. This amount was used to buy container-laboratories to investigate specimens. Those equipment were to be located in a donated field nearby Maracanã Stadium. From the initial amount announced, R$180 thousand was delivered. On 21 May 2019 the Director travelled to Germany and France to ask for the rest and more help, because Brazil Government seems not possible to financially further help. From Germany, the second amount of €145 thousand or R$654 thousand was donated. *Each of 140 geoparks of UNESCO's conservation areas will collect and send a lithic, fossil, or cultural artifact to Brazil. This means 140 objects would complement the future collection. *On 17 October 2018, Secretary of the Patrimony of the Union, Sidrack Correia confirmed the donation of the area of 49,300 m², that is about a kilometer from the museum, to install laboratories containers in 45 days, budgeted at R$2.2 million, purchased with funds from the TJRJ Pecunary Penalty Fund to be used by museum researchers. It also serves as a center for students visitation. Part of the total, 10 thousand square meters will be for the Justice Court to install its transport area. *The National Institute of Industrial Property (INPI), linked to the Ministry of Industry, Foreign Trade and Services (MDIC), concluded on 17 October 2018 the donation of 1,164 items, mostly mobile, to the National Museum. The furniture, which includes tables, chairs, workstations, drawers and cabinets, aid in the restructuring of the Museum. The idea of the donation came from the need for the institute to free itself of idle equipment that was in its old headquarters, in Edifício A Noite, located in Praça Mauá, the port area of Rio de Janeiro, to allow the return of the property to the Secretariat of the Patrimony of the Union (SPU), which should have been empty. Part of the furniture was taken to the Botanical Garden of the National Museum, located in Quinta da Boa Vista, where some sectors are working. Others will be used in the direction of the museum, in the services of museology and teaching assistance, and in the departments of invertebrates, geology, paleontology, entomology and ethnology. *On 24 October 2018, a farmer from Cuiabá donates 780 old Brazilian coins at an average value of R$5 thousand to Rio de Janeiro National Museum. More than R$100 thousand was donated in campaign to museum. *On 13 November 2018, the Universidade Estadual do Pará donated 514 insects to the Museum, 314 were borrowed from there. Among them were grasshoppers. *On 25 May 2019, Nuuvem, largest gaming platform in Latin America, donated R$16,860 to the National Museum. The two-day income from the game \\"The Hero's Legend\\" was reverted to the museum and 500 gamers engaged in the action. The inspiration came from an initiative that Ubisoft created for the game \\"Assassin's Creed\\" for the reconstruction of the Cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris. *Until June 2019, the small donations from several private individuals summed R$323 thousand. *The British Council donated R$150 thousand for educational exchange. *The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew would donate in 2020 a collection of relics collected in the Amazon, stored in the British institution for over 150 years. The items were grouped by botanist Richard Spruce, who spent 15 years gathering specimens and making notes while travelling through the forest and brought to Queen Victoria ceremonial tools and objects used by indigenous tribes in the region. His collection, later stored in the Kew Gardens archives, also includes wooden baskets and graters, trumpets, rattles, and ritual headdresses. *Wilson Saviano, professor at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, donated 300 pieces, 15 paintings and 40 books from his private collection of contemporary African art. *Books: In entomology, it had 20 donations that would give about 23,000 items, it was certainly one of the areas that suffered the most. In vertebrates, more than 500 specimens from various areas of Brazil were donated. In geology and paleontology, it had assets seized by the IRS that were destined for the National Museum. Kellner points out that the Francisca Keller Library of the Graduate Program in Social Anthropology, which had 37,000 documents and books and was fully incinerated, is already being rebuilt. About 10,500 volumes had been donated, and another 8,000 were on the way. From France is approximately 700 kilos. At the Central Library the donation of several other books, over 170 kilos.  Political influences  Figures which had in museum The director of the National Museum, Alexander W. A. Kellner, issued an open letter addressed to presidential candidates Jair Messias Bolsonaro and Fernando Haddad on the evening of 15 October 2018, which, along two pages, reinforces the historical importance of the institution, and recalls that his survival is tied to the responsibility of those who hold \\"power in the hands.\\" The document was also sent to the National Congress, where he had regularly gone to ask for a public hearing, during which he asked for the inclusion of resources for the museum, and for the next budget. Without these resources, he says the institution will end up harming decades of research. In the letter, the director says that many reflect on what could have been done differently to avoid a disaster that led to the loss of an invaluable patrimony, involving millions of cultural and scientific pieces. He also adds that \\"others should be deeply reflecting on why, being in a position of decision, they did not act firmly in triggering actions that would have avoided the absurdity of that loss\\". On 17 October 2018, the Director of the Museum had a meeting with federal deputies to first resolve the R$50 million needed to reinstall the front part of Palace.In late October 2018, the museum's director attended an audience in Brasília at the Chamber of Deputies in order to secure R$56 million for the basic reconstruction of the front part of main building, No. 1, including the facade, roof and its structure. He negotiated the money before the President- elect Jair Bolsonaro, being afraid that the building would remain destroyed for years in an abandoned state. Also, the laboratory containers were not received. On 31 October 2018, the Chamber of Deputies approved an amendment of R$55 million to the budget of 2019. This would need to be further approved by a joint committee and also by the plenary. The Director travelled to China to guarantee pieces of collections for the museum. During his travel to (Germany), specifically Berlin, Munich and Paris, France to bargain some money, the amount of R$55 million, supposed to reconstruct some part of building was reduced to R$43 million by Government. However the Louvre Museum could lend some Egyptian pieces to be displayed in Rio de Janeiro, when its reconstruction comes done. From this sum, until June 2019, Education Ministry or Ministério da Educação (MEC) paid R$908.800,00 for the facade project. A proposal by Senator Maria do Carmo Alves (DEM-SE) under review in the Commission of Education, Culture and Sport proposes to include a National Day of the Museum, in the official Brazilian calendar to be celebrated on 18 May. Until December 2018, the concern was the change of the Brazilian Government, because none of the transition teams of the future Governor of Rio de Janeiro, nor the President of the Republic Jair Messias Bolsonaro have sought the direction of the museum to talk about the disaster that hit the former Residence of the Imperial Family. Even then, the containers to store restored objects, until the reconstruction work is completed, had not yet been delivered by the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, which did not express its opinion on the delay. The top of this piece, the head, was recovered  Recent Events  During the three months after the fire debris was removed, the \\"economic support network\\" promised by the president was not established. The partnership to help the museum would count on the participation of the Brazilian Federation of Banks (Febraban), Petrobrás, Bradesco, Itaú, Santander, Caixa, Banco do Brasil, BNDES and Vale. According to the entity, the banks are awaiting approval of Provisional Measure 851 in the National Congress to be able to make the donations. The text must be approved by Congress until February 2019. If this does not happen, the Provisional Measure loses its validity. \\"The first disbursement of the contract between the BNDES, the Association of Friends of the National Museum and UFRJ, with a total execution period of four years, was scheduled for October 2018 of R$ 3 million.\\" In June 2018, when the National Museum completed 200 years, the BNDES signed a R$21.7 million contract to pay for the update of the building, but before the first transfer of R$3 million, it caught fire. The agreement was maintained, and the BNDES promised that the money would be used to support the reconstruction works. That was not done. Until final of 2018, only R$8.9 million was released to carry out emergency works for the reconstruction of the building. The Ministry of Education (MEC) gave R$5 million to a second phase of elaboration of recovery project of the Museum. Unesco personnel and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs visited the debris. Another R$2.5 million was allocated to the research of the institution through the Coordination of Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (Capes). 1,500 items were found among the rubble, between parts of the collection, equipment, personal property and others not unidentifiable. Among them were pieces from the Egyptian collection and minerals from the Werner collection, that came to Brazil along with the Portuguese Crown, as well as pre-Columbian ceramics. A partnership with Google Brasil, through Google Arts & Culture, allowed guided virtual tours via internet of 160 items from the collections in 2016.

In the case of re-emergence, the severity of the symptoms is often worse than pretreatment levels. Examples=Sedative hypnotics= Rebound insomnia Rebound insomnia is insomnia that occurs following discontinuation of sedative substances taken to relieve primary insomnia. Regular use of these substances can cause a person to become dependent on its effects in order to fall asleep. Therefore, when a person has stopped taking the medication and is 'rebounding' from its effects, he or she may experience insomnia as a symptom of withdrawal. Occasionally, this insomnia may be worse than the insomnia the drug was intended to treat. Common medicines known to cause this problem are eszopiclone, zolpidem, and anxiolytics such as benzodiazepines and which are prescribed to people having difficulties falling or staying asleep. Rebound depression Depressive symptoms may appear to arise in patients previously free of such an illness. Daytime rebound Rebound phenomena do not necessarily only occur on discontinuation of a prescribed dosage. For example, daytime rebound effects of anxiety, metallic taste, perceptual disturbances which are typical benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms can occur the next day after a short acting benzodiazepine hypnotic wears off. Another example is early morning rebound insomnia which may occur when a rapidly eliminated hypnotic wears off which leads to rebounding awakeness forcing the person to become wide awake before he or she has had a full night's sleep. One drug which seems to be commonly associated with these problems is triazolam due to its high potency and ultra short half life but these effects can occur with other short acting hypnotic drugs. Quazepam due to its selectivity for type1 benzodiazepine receptors and long half life does not cause daytime anxiety rebound effects during treatment, showing that half life is very important for determining whether a nighttime hypnotic will cause next day rebound withdrawal effects or not. Daytime rebound effects are not necessarily mild but can sometimes produce quite marked psychiatric and psychological disturbances. =Stimulants= Rebound effects from stimulants such as methylphenidate or dextroamphetamine include stimulant psychosis, depression and a return of ADHD symptoms but in a temporarily exaggerated form. Up to a third of ADHD children experience a rebound effect when methylphenidate is withdrawn. =Antidepressants= Many antidepressants, including SSRIs, can cause rebound depression, panic attacks, anxiety, and insomnia when discontinued. =Antipsychotics= Sudden and severe emergence or re-emergence of psychosis may appear when antipsychotics are switched or discontinued too rapidly. =alpha-2 adrenergic agents= Rebound hypertension, above pre-treatment level, was observed after clonidine, and guanfacine discontinuation. =Others= Other rebound effects An example is the use of highly potent corticosteroids, such as clobetasol for psoriasis. Abrupt withdrawal can cause a much more severe case of the psoriasis to develop. Therefore, withdrawal should be gradual, diluting the medication with lotion perhaps, until very little actual medication is being applied. Another example of pharmaceutical rebound is a rebound headache from painkillers when the dose is lowered, the medication wears off, or the drug is abruptly discontinued. Continuous usage of topical decongestants (nasal sprays) can lead to constant nasal congestion, known as rhinitis medicamentosa.

It takes its name from the \\"black earth\\" residue of settlement mounds. Terramare is from terra marna, \\"marl-earth\\", where marl is a lacustrine deposit. It may be any color but in agricultural lands it is most typically black, giving rise to the \\"black earth\\" identification of it. The population of the terramare sites is called the terramaricoli. The sites were excavated exhaustively in 1860–1910. These sites prior to the second half of the 19th century were commonly believed to have been used for Gallic and Roman sepulchral rites. They were called terramare and marnier by the farmers of the region, who mined the soil for fertilizer. Scientific study began with Bartolomeo Gastaldi in 1860. He was investigating peat bogs and old lake sites in north Italy but did some investigations of the marnier, recognizing them finally as habitation, not funerary, sites similar to the pile dwellings further north. His studies attracted the attention of Pellegrino Strobel and his 18-year-old assistant, Luigi Pigorini. In 1862 they wrote a piece concerning the Castione di Marchesi in Parma, a terramare site. They were the first to perceive that the settlements were prehistoric. Starting from Gaetano Chierici's theory that the pile dwellings further north represented an ancestral Roman population, Pigorini developed a theory of Indo-European settlement of Italy from the north. Settlements Reconstructed Terramare houses The Terramare, in spite of local differences, is of typical form; each settlement is trapezoidal, with streets arranged in a quadrangular pattern. Some houses are built upon piles even though the village is entirely on dry land and some are not. There is currently no commonly accepted explanation for the piles. The whole is protected by an earthwork strengthened on the inside by buttresses, and encircled by a wide moat supplied with running water. In all over 60 villages are known, almost entirely from Emilia. In the Middle Bronze Age they are no larger than placed at an average density of 1 per . In the Late Bronze Age many sites have been abandoned and the ones that were not are larger, up to . The remains discovered may be briefly summarized. Stone objects are few. Of bronze (the chief material) axes, daggers, swords, razors, and knives are found, as also minor implements, such as sickles, needles, pins, brooches, etc. Also remarkable is the finding of a large number of stone moulds, needed to obtain the bronze objects. There are also objects of bone and wood, besides pottery (both coarse and fine), amber, and glass paste. Small clay figures, chiefly of animals (though human figures are found at Castellazzo), are interesting as being practically the earliest specimens of plastic art found in Italy. Society Bronze axe The occupations of the terramare people as compared with their Neolithic predecessors may be inferred with comparative certainty. They remained hunters, but also had domesticated animals; they were fairly skilful metallurgists, casting bronze in moulds of stone and clay; they were also agriculturists, cultivating beans, grapes, wheat, and flax. According to William RidgewayWho were the Romans? p. 16; and Early Age of Greece, i. 496 the dead were treated to inhumation: further investigation, however, of the cemeteries shows that both inhumation and cremation were practiced, with cremated remains placed in ossuaries; practically no objects were found in the urns. Cremation may have been a later introduction. Development and collapse For the early phases of the Middle Bronze Age it is plausible to think of the Terramare in terms of a polycentric settlement system, with apparently no substantial differences between one village and another. The density of dwellings rose, and in the MB2 (1550–1450 BC) is worthy of note. There are areas, coinciding with those that have been most extensively investigated, in which the inhabited settlements in this phase are no more than 2 kilometres one from the other. It can therefore be supposed that the entire territory was occupied by a tight-knit network of villages, a polycentric system with settlements generally covering between 1 and 2 hectares and occupied by up to 250/260 inhabitants (about 125 per hectare). At that point, the dimension of the settlements began to vary. Until the MB2, their size did not normally exceed two hectares, but during the MB3 (1450–1350 BC), there was a substantial increase in the surface area occupied by certain of these settlements, while others remained limited in size or disappeared altogether. This tendency was consolidated in the LBA. Several of these settlements cover an area of up to 20 hectares. The size of the embankments and ditches can reach remarkable proportions, some exceeding 30 metres in width. For the more advanced phase of the Middle Bronze Age, and above all during the Late Bronze Age (1350–1150 BC), we can hypothesise a greater degree of diversified territorial organisation, including centres which are larger and tending towards hegemony, adjacent to smaller sites. In certain areas during the LBA, we see a higher frequency of sites occupying a larger extension and a scant presence of small-size settlements, perhaps due to a marked tendency towards concentration of population. This trend seems to be accentuated during the advanced LBA, when the overall number of settlements decreases, with a tendency towards concentration in larger-size settlements and probable subordination of the smaller settlements to the larger ones. Around 1200 BC a serious crisis began for the terramare culture that within a few years led to the abandonment of all the settlements; the reasons for this crisis, roughly contemporaneous with the Late Bronze Age collapse in the eastern Mediterranean, are still not entirely clear, it seems possible that in the face of an incipient overpopulation (between 150,000 and 200,000 individuals were calculated) and depletion of natural resources, a series of drought periods led to a deep economic crisis, famine, and consequently the disruption of the political order, which caused the collapse of society. Around 1150 BC the terramare were completely abandoned, with no settlements replacing them. The plains, especially in the area of Emilia, were abandoned for several centuries, and only in the Roman era they regain the density of population reached during the terramare period. It has been suggested that the memory of the fate of the terramare culture may have lasted for centuries, until it was recorded by Dionysius of Halicarnassus, in his first book on the Roman Antiquities, as the fate of the Pelasgians. In his record the Pelasgians occupied the Po Valley up to two generations before the Trojan War, but were forced, by a series of famines of which they could not understand the reason, or find a solution, to leave their once-fertile land and move to the south, where they merged with the Aborigines. Theories of ethnic identity Significant differences of opinion have arisen as to the origin and ethnographic relations of the Terramare population. Edoardo Brizio, in his Epoca preistorica (1898), advanced a theory that the Terramare population had been the original Ligurians. Brizio believed that the Ligures, at some early point, took to erecting pile dwellings, although why they should have abandoned their previously unprotected hut-settlements for elaborate fortifications is unclear. While Brizio did not envision invading peoples until long after the Terramare period, the pile dwellings, ramparts and moats at Terramare sites have usually seemed more akin to military defenses, than the prevention of inundation during regular flooding; for instance, Terramare buildings usually stood on hills. There are other difficulties of a similar character with Brizio's theory. Luigi Pigorini (1842–1925) proposed that a population derived from the Terramare culture was a dominant component of the Proto-Villanovan culture—especially in its northern and Campanian phases and the Terramare culture has been an Indo-European-speaking population, the ancestors of the Italici, i.e. the Italic-speaking peoples. Pigorini also attributed to the Italici a tradition of lake dwellings, modified in Italy into Terramare-style pile dwelling on dry land. More recently, Italian archeologist Andrea Cardarelli has proposed re-evaluations of contemporaneous Greek accounts, such as that of Dionysius of Halicarnassus, and to link the Terramare culture to the Pelasgians whom the Greeks generally equated with the Tyrrhenians and specifically, therefore, the Etruscans.

Early life Ducat was born in Brixton, London, but grew up in Southend. The cricket writer David Foot said his surname was \\"pronounced 'Dewkitt' by the family, 'Duckett' on the football terraces\\". Cricket career He joined the ground staff at the Oval in 1906, and soon became a regular member of the county team, playing alongside Tom Hayward, Jack Hobbs and Ernest Hayes. Standing 5'10\\" high, he was a powerful, forcing batsman, and made 52 centuries for Surrey, including 306 not out in 280 minutes against the University of Oxford in 1919. He was also one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1920. He missed many matches due to injury: a broken leg in 1912 almost ended his career, and he missed the 1924 season after breaking his arm in the nets. In 1928, he made 994 runs in less than six weeks, including centuries in four successive matches. He played in only one Test, the 3rd Test against Australia at Headingley in 1921 when he was unlucky to only make 3 and 2. He was \\"doubly\\" out in the first innings: his bat disintegrated when he played a ball bowled by Ted McDonald, the ball looping to slip where it was caught, and part of the bat dislodging a bail. He was given out caught rather than hit wicket. Football career Ducat also had a successful football career. He started out playing for non-league Southend United before joining First Division Woolwich Arsenal in 1905. He made his Arsenal debut on 11 February 1905, in a 2–0 win against Blackburn Rovers, playing at centre forward. After losing his place in 1906–07, he was later switched to right half and became a regular in 1907–08 and 1908–09. During his time at Arsenal, he won three caps for England, with his debut coming against Ireland in Belfast on 12 February 1910; England won 6–1. On his second appearance for England, against Wales on 14 March the same year, Ducat scored the only goal in a 1–0 win. Ducat's ability and success with England brought attention from bigger clubs than Arsenal, who were at the time going through a financial crisis. Eventually, he was sold for £1,000 to England's most successful club Aston Villa in 1912, having played 188 matches and scored 21 goals for Arsenal. After suffering a broken leg in his first season at Villa, he recovered to become a stalwart in the side, captaining Villa to their sixth FA Cup win in 1919–20, beating Huddersfield Town. He also regained his England place; having not played since 1910, he won three more caps during 1920, the last coming in a 2–0 win against Ireland at Roker Park on 23 October 1920, bringing his total number of England appearances to six. He moved to Fulham in 1921, and upon his retirement from playing in 1924, he succeeded Phil Kelso (his former boss at Arsenal) as Fulham manager. However, the Cottagers struggled with Ducat in charge, finishing 12th and 19th in the Second Division during the two seasons he was at the helm. He was sacked in 1926. After his departure from Fulham, he continued to play amateur football for the Casuals. Retirement and death After retiring from cricket in 1931, Ducat became cricket coach at Eton College for five years. He was also a sports reporter for the Daily Sketch. He died suddenly in 1942 during a game at Lord's Cricket Ground of an apparent heart attack after lunch whilst playing in a wartime cricket match between teams from his unit of the Home Guard from Surrey against another from Sussex. The match was immediately abandoned as a mark of respect for Ducat. He was aged 56, and is the only person to have died while playing in a match at Lord's.

The mobile device and the network negotiate phases in which data transfer occurs. During other times the device turns its receiver off and enters a low power state. This is usually a function designed into the protocol that allows this to happen - most notably how the transmission is structured - for example in slots with headers containing address details so that devices can listen to these headers in each slot to decide whether the transmission is relevant to them or not. In this case, the receiver only has to be active at the beginning of each slot to receive the header, conserving battery life. Other techniques include polling, whereby the device is placed into standby for a given amount of time and then a beacon is sent by the access point or base station periodically which indicates if there is any waiting data for it.

It was the flag of the former Government of Northern Ireland and common flag of Northern Ireland from 1953 until that government was abolished in 1972. Origin Arms of the former Government of Northern Ireland, 1924–1972 Original Tudor Crown version of flag based on escutcheon of arms granted by Royal Warrant in 1924 Traditional Flag of Ulster The arms and flag were designed in Dublin Castle by Major Sir Nevile Wilkinson, Ulster King of Arms, in 1923–1924. The flag is based on the flag of the traditional province of Ulster,CRW Flags of the World – Northern Ireland (United Kingdom) including a Red Hand of Ulster in the centre, and the red de Burgh crossCRW Flags – Northern Ireland (United Kingdom) (though some claim this is the Saint George's CrossCAIN: Symbols – Flags Used in Northern Ireland).

Loyalists often use 'Ulster' as another name for Northern Ireland, and Stormont was the seat of the former Government of Northern Ireland. History=Use by the Government of Northern Ireland= In 1924, the Government of Northern Ireland was granted its own coat of arms by Royal Warrant and had the right to display these arms on a flag or banner. This right was exercised for the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. From 1953 until 1972, the flag was used officially by the Government of Northern Ireland and also as a de facto civic flag for Northern Ireland. In 1972, the Government and Parliament of Northern Ireland were abolished by the Parliament of the United Kingdom under the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973. =Later use= Since the Government of Northern Ireland was abolished in 1972, the flag (and variations thereof) has continued to be used by unionists. In 2004, Belfast City Council commissioned a study on the flying of flags which noted that the Ulster Banner continued to be flown, alongside the Union flag, by three unionist-controlled local authorities in Northern Ireland: Ards Borough Council, Carrickfergus Borough Council and Castlereagh Borough Council.http://www.belfastcity.gov.uk/equality/docs/FlyingOfUnionFlagEQIA.pdf International sport The Ulster Banner is used to represent Northern Ireland at the Commonwealth Games,Commonwealth Games Federation Telegraph players on the PGA Tour, and by FIFA to represent the Northern Ireland national football team.Northern Ireland: Country information, FIFA.com At recent Rugby World Cups the Irish Rugby team, which represents the entire island of Ireland, has played under two flags - the Irish national flag and the Flag of Ulster, the official flag of the IRFU Ulster Branch - rather than a flag representing Northern Ireland.https://danieldcollins.wordpress.com/2015/10/21/is-irish-rugby-truly- the-beacon-of-inclusiveness-it-is-purported-to-be/ See also * List of flags of Ireland * List of flags of the United Kingdom * List of flags used in Northern Ireland References Category:Flags of Ireland Category:Ulster Category:Government of Northern Ireland Category:Flags of Northern Ireland Category:Flags with crosses ","title":"Ulster Banner"},{"id":"2287313","title":"The Yellow Rose of Texas (song)"},{"id":"2287314","text":"The Racist Mind: Portraits of American Neo-Nazis and Klansmen is a book by Raphael S.

It is the fifth most populous municipality of the Metropolitan City, behind Catania, Acireale, Misterbianco and Paternò. Alongside Catania, it is the only town who is seat of a tribunal in the former province. Since 1987, the comune has obtained the City title, through presidential act. After Caltanissetta, it is the second most populous comune in Central Sicily. The town is a production center of pottery, particularly maiolica and terra-cotta wares. Nowadays, the production is more and more oriented to artistic production of ceramics and terra-cotta sculptures. Other activities are mainly related to agriculture (production of grapes, olives, peaches), third-sector activities and tourism. History The city's name derives from the Arabic \\"qal'at-al-jarar\\" (\\"Castle of [pottery] jars\\") – a name that attests to the antiquity of the pottery works which are still thriving. It has been inhabited since prehistoric times, as shown by the presence of two necropoleis dating from the second millennium BCE and by numerous other archaeological finds. It was later inhabited by the Sicels pre- Roman population. The Arabs built a castle here that in 1030 was attacked by Ligurian troops under the Byzantine general George Maniakes, who have left traces of Ligurian language in the current dialect. The city flourished under the Norman and Hohenstaufen domination, becoming a renowned center for production of ceramics. The city was almost completely destroyed by the earthquake of 1693. Many public and private buildings have then been reconstructed in earthquake Baroque style. Primarily for this reason the city has been included, together with the surrounding territory, in an area protected by the UNESCO World Heritage program. During the first part of the XX Century, it was the house of Italian Christian democracy, due to the presence of renowned politician Luigi Sturzo. Later, the town expressed various nationwide politician, such as Italian Prime minister Mario Scelba, and Sicilian president Silvio Milazzo. Today, Caltagirone is a mid-tier Sicilian town. It is one of the 25 most populous town in Sicily, and one of the 250 most populous in Italy. Geography The municipality borders with Acate (RG), Gela (CL), Grammichele, Licodia Eubea, Mazzarino (CL), Mazzarrone, Mineo, Mirabella Imbaccari, Niscemi (CL), Piazza Armerina (EN) and San Michele di Ganzaria. Its hamlets (frazioni) of Albanazzo, Colleggiata (or Collegiata), Favarella, Granieri, Mulino Buongiovanni, Piano Carbone, Piano San Paolo, Rangasia, San Basilio – Casa Prete, San Mauro, Santo Pietro, Serra Fornazzo, Signore del Soccorso, Villa Gravina and Villa Grazia. Main sights A collection of ancient and modern pottery and terra-cotta, dating back to the Magna Grecia period, is available in the local Museum of Pottery, created in 1965. The main landmark of the city is the 142-step monumental ' (Staircase of Santa Maria del Monte), built from 1608 in the old part of the town. The peculiarity is that each step is decorated with different hand-decorated ceramics, using styles and figures derived from the millennial tradition of pottery making. Once a year, on and around the day of the city's patron saint, (St. James, 25 July), the staircase is illuminated with candles of different colours arranged in order to reconstruct an artistic drawing of several tens of meters. Religious buildings include: * The Cathedral of St. Julian, of Norman origin, with a twentieth-century art nouveau façade by Saverio Gulli. * The Baroque Saint Francis of Paula Church. The sacristy is in Gothic style, dating from before the 1693 earthquake. * Saint Francis Church, edified in 1236 and rebuilt in Baroque style after 1693. The façade has two orders with marine symbols and a statue of the Immaculate. The dome is unfinished. * Jesus Church or Chiesa del Gesù (1570). The façade has eight statues portraying saints and the Madonna with Child. The interior, one a single nave, houses a Pietà by Filippo Paladino (1607) and Christ's Nativity by Polidoro da Caravaggio. * Santa Maria del Monte (12th century). * The Renaissance Church of the New Capuchins, in white stone, with a noteworthy treasure and a picture gallery. * St. James. * Also noteworthy is the Palazzo Senatorio (15th century), the former Town Hall.

He served as director of the Geological Survey of Norway. Biography Born in Bergen, he was educated at the University of Leipzig and Heidelberg University. He graduated Ph.D. at the University of Christiania (now University of Oslo) in 1883. He was married to the painter Helga Marie Ring Reusch He joined the Geological Survey of Norway in 1875, and was its Director from 1888 to 1921. He was a Sturgis Hooper Professor of Geology at Harvard University (1897–98). He is distinguished for his research on the crystalline schists and the Palaeozoic rocks of Norway. He discovered Silurian fossils in the highly altered rocks of the Bergen region; and in 1891 he called attention to the so-called \\"Reusch's Moraine\\" a Precambrian conglomerate of glacial origin in the Varanger Fjord, a view confirmed by A. Strahan in 1896, who found glacial striations on the rocks beneath the ancient boulder-bed. Reusch has likewise thrown light on the later geological periods, on the Pleistocene glacial phenomena and on the sculpturing of the scenery of Norway. In 1877 Reusch founded a popular science magazine, Naturen. He edited it for the first four years. Among his separate publications were Silurfossiler og pressede Konglomerater (1882) and Det nordlige Norges Geologi (1891). He chaired the Norwegian Geographical Society from 1898 to 1903, and from 1907 to 1909. In 1900 he was among the founders of the Norwegian association of book artwork (Foreningen for norsk bokkunst). In 1907, his honorary doctorate was awarded at Oxford University. In 1922, he served as the first chairman of the Norwegian Association of Bibliophiles (Bibliofiklubben). Reusch died at Hvalstad Station while attempting to enter a train. At the time of his death, his large private library of books encompassed 12 000 volumes. He is commemorated by the Reusch Medal, awarded by the Norwegian Geological Society. Reusch Glacier in Antarctica, Reuschhalvøya and Reuschfjellet on Svalbard were also named in his honor.

These muscles both insert into the calcaneus, the bone of the heel of the human foot, and form the major part of the muscle of the posterior leg, commonly known as the calf muscle.  Structure  The triceps surae is connected to the foot through the Achilles tendon, and has 3 heads deriving from the 2 major masses of muscle. * The superficial portion (the gastrocnemius) gives off 2 heads attaching to the base of the femur directly above the knee. * The deep (profundus) mass of muscle (the soleus) forms the remaining head which attaches to the superior posterior area of the tibia. The triceps surae is innervated by the tibial nerve, specifically, nerve roots L5–S2.  Function  Contraction of the triceps surae induce plantar flexion (sagittal plane) and stabilization of the ankle complex in the transverse plane. Functional activities include primarily movement in the sagittal plane, stabilization during locomotion (walking, running), restraining the body from falling and power jumping. By controlling the disequilibrium torque, the triceps surae can affect force through the exchange of potential into kinetic energy. Clinical significance= Calf strain (torn calf muscle) = A calf strain refers to damage to a muscle or its attaching tendons. A premature return before recovery is achieved will result in a prolonged recovery or incomplete return to baseline prior to injury. Stretches such as alternating calf raises can improve flexibility as well as mobilize legs before running. Calf muscles are also very suspectable to Fasciculations and people with Benign Fasciculation Syndrome often complain of twitching in either one or both calves.

It prompted a large influx of refugees from the mainland, causing a huge population surge: from 1945 to 1951, the population grew from 600,000 to 2.1 million. The government struggled to accommodate these immigrants. Unrest in China also prompted businesses to relocate their assets and capital from Shanghai to Hong Kong. Together with the cheap labour of the immigrants, the seeds of Hong Kong's economic miracle in the second half of the 20th century were sown. Background Causeway Bay 1955 As the Communists drew near to a victory in early 1949, there were fears that Hong Kong was going to be invaded by the Communists. The British Government was determined to keep Hong Kong as a capitalist outpost within a communist sphere of influence, though the memories of the Berlin Blockade and the perceived antagonism of communist governments was still fresh in their mind. The garrison was reinforced and plans of emergency evacuation to Australia were made. However, the People's Liberation Army were ordered to stop advancing at the Sham-chun-Hong Kong border and Hong Kong remained a British colony. Hong Kong was a valuable trade centre at the mouth of China and hoped that by retaining this connection doing business with the new government in Peking would be easier. To give up Hong Kong to the Communists without a fight would be seen as a national weakness in the face of the growing communist threat in Europe and Asia, especially the Emergency in Malaya. Debates did take place during the 1950s at the British Parliament in Westminster in which it was discussed that Hong Kong would have to be handed back to China if the colony's entrepôt trade could not be maintained.Wiltshire, Trea.

ISBN Volume Three 962-7283-61-4 The people were outraged at any suggestion of this, so the Government of Hong Kong became committed to turning Hong Kong into a manufacturing centre. Demographics Coat of Arms of Hong Kong (1959-1997), officially adopted in late January 1959 =Population= The 1950s began with a large number of impoverished people without jobs and natural resources. The problem was further compounded with a flood of refugees from mainland ChinaWalters, Alan Arthur. Walter, James. Hanke, Steve. [1998] (1998). The Revolution in Development Economics. Cato Institute Publishing. who were able to cross due to the lack of border controls until June 1951. The People's Republic of China was established in 1949 under a reorganised Communist Party. As many as 100,000 people fled to Hong Kong each month under the new regime, many of whom were rich farmers and capitalists who brought with them management experience, though even more were criminals who established the influential triad society in Hong Kong. By the mid-1950s, Hong Kong had increased its population to a staggering 2.2 million. By 1956, Hong Kong's population density became one of the highest in the world.Chan, Shun- hing. Leung, Beatrice. [2003] (2003). Changing Church and State Relations in Hong Kong, 1950-2000. Hong Kong: HK University Press. Page 24. =Rising buildings= In 1953, the Shek Kip Mei Fire left 53,000 homeless. This prompted major change: Sir Alexander Grantham, the 22nd Governor of Hong Kong, drew up an emergency housing programme that introduced the 'multi-storey building' as a common building form. His structures were capable of housing 2,500 people in a fire/flood-proof structure. The idea was to house as many and as fast as possible to deal with the homeless shelter crisis. Every floor in the building incommunal room, washroom, and toilet facility. Each person was granted 24 square metres of space.Wiltshire, Trea. [First published 1987] (republished & reduced 2003).

ISBN Volume Three 962-7283-61-4 The high rise buildings would become the norm, as skyscrapers have a small footprint compared to their overall volume. Culture Cantonese Opera =Lifestyle= At the end of the Japanese occupation, the Government of Hong Kong held a monopoly on the purchase and distribution of food and raw materials including rice and cotton yarn. Price controls by the Government were not eliminated until 1953. The period can best be summarised by low resources and an endless increase in population. Many mainlanders would cross the border to Hong Kong and establish illegal huts on rooftops and edge of mountains.Ma, Eric Kit-wai. Ma, Chieh-Wei. [1999] (1999). Culture, Politics, and Television in Hong Kong. United Kingdom: Routledge. The integration of different groups from China and original tenants of Hong Kong would also create a society in which everyone had to wrestle with the overwhelming number of language dialects. =Education= Those who were born in Hong Kong were provided with education and housing by the government. The first group of refugees were only granted temporary asylums since the government believed they would return to the mainland. An estimated 9% of the government's expense were spent on education and health care.Schenk, Catherine Ruth. [2001] (2001). Hong Kong as an International Financial Centre: Emergence and Development, 1945-1965. United Kingdom: Routledge. The curriculum made it crucial that students did not feel associated with Hong Kong or China in any national sense. It emphasised that they were the middleman for the Sino-British trade relationships. An internal government paper in the period indicated about 34 schools in the urban area were actually classified as controlled by the Communists, including 24 in the New Territories. Another 32 schools by leftist elements such as staff and teachers. A new ordinance was passed in 1952 to allow any director of education to shut down a school believed to be controlled by political indoctrination.Chan, Shun-hing. Leung, Beatrice. [2003] (2003). Changing Church and State Relations in Hong Kong, 1950-2000. Hong Kong: HK university press. Page 26. The refugees mostly sought their education and social services from Christian churches. Actions were taken at the Heung Tao Middle School and Nanfang College.Bray, Mark. Koo, Ramsey. [2005] (2005) Education and Society in Hong Kong and Macao: Comparative Perspectives on Continuity and Change. Hong Kong: Springer Press. =Entertainment= One of the main forms of entertainment in the 1950s was Cantonese Opera. Shaw Brothers Studio would also produce some of the first groups of martial art films. Their notable sword fighting style would be emulated on many movies and TV dramas for years to come. =Law and order= The Hong Kong 1956 riots was one of the first full-scale riots in the territory. It awoke the Government to the dangers of low wages, long working hours, and overcrowded conditions. Tighter law control would diminish the triads in the period. Most of the social problems in the 1950s dealt with Nationalist and Communist factions on Hong Kong soil. The British Government in Whitehall, London, feared the Communists would promote anti-British sentiments in the colony. Thus, the Colonial Office in Whitehall encouraged the Government of Hong Kong to follow anti-Communist policies within the colony. Economy Royal Observatory, Hong Kong, in Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon, in 1950 =Transportation= Hong Kong Taxi service was founded in 1947 with just a mere 329 cars. By the end of the decade in 1959, it had expanded to 851 cars.HK Gov. \\"HK Gov .\\" Taxi Annual Traffic report. Retrieved 23 February 2007. The service became more popular since it does not require passengers to follow a particular bus route. =Industrial= In 1953, two land reclamation projects added to Hong Kong. The first project would specifically add runway space to the Kai Tak Airport. Additional land would turn Kwun Tong and Tsuen Wan into industrial towns. The early industrial centres churned out anything that could be produced in a small space, like buttons, artificial flowers, umbrellas, textiles, enamelware, footwear and plastics. =Hospital and hospitality= The handling of the refugees required the collaboration of numerous services and programs. The British Red Cross would set up their first branch in Hong Kong on 12 July 1950 as the Hong Kong Red Cross. They started in the Lai Chi Kok Hospital and began the Patient Concern Service. Blood donation also began in 1952 with 483 people donating in the first year. A Disaster Relief service was established in 1953 mostly to deal with the Shek Kip Mei fire.Lui, Tai-lok. Lü, Dale. [2001] (2001). Light the Darkness: The Story of the Hong Kong Red Cross, 1950-2000. Hong Kong: HK university press. The Hong Kong Tourism Association was established in 1957. =Finance= The banks at the time were not regulated by the Government. There were no central banks or monetary policies. The Governor did not want to regulate the Hong Kong Stock Exchange even though it had become a serious problem in financing the fast-growing economy at the time. Manufacturers constantly complained about the shortage of investments. Pressure was coming from within and outside Hong Kong to get the policies fixed.

General description The French cover of the book The Kybalion was first published in 1908 by the Yogi Publication Society in Chicago, Illinois and has been in the public domain since 1977. Purportedly based upon ancient Hermeticism, its philosophies became founding pillars within the New Thought movement of the early 1910s. The book early on makes the claim that it makes its appearance in one's life when the time is appropriate and includes axioms and insights similar to those found in the Book of Proverbs. Authorship The \\"Three Initiates\\" who authored The Kybalion chose to remain anonymous. As a result, a great deal of speculation has been made about who actually wrote the book. The most common proposal is that The Kybalion was authored by William Walker Atkinson, either alone or with others, such as Paul Foster Case and Elias Gewurz. Atkinson was known to use many pseudonyms, and to self-publish his works. Also suggestive is that among his earliest published pseudonymous and anonymous works may have been a series entitled The Arcane Teachings (first published prior to 1909 and the second edition in 1909), which bears many superficial similarities to The Kybalion. While the latter explores seven \\"Hermetic Principles\\", The Arcane Teachings examines seven \\"Arcane Laws\\"; The Kybalion claims to be an elucidation of an ancient, unpublished Hermetic text of the same name, and The Arcane Teachings claims to reveal the wisdom of an ancient, unpublished scroll of occult aphorisms. Both books describe three \\"Great Planes\\" of reality which are further subdivided into seven lesser planes. Both also describe three of the lesser planes as \\"astral black keys\\" analogous to the black keys on a piano, and inhabited by elemental spirits. And both books describe the process of \\"Mental Alchemy\\" in great detail, and in near-complete agreement with each other. There are other similarities, and some argue that The Arcane Teachings might have been Atkinson's \\"first draft\\" of material which later became The Kybalion. Atkinson also attempted to describe the workings of the universe in terms of a set of laws in his last manuscript The Seven Cosmic Laws, written in 1931 and published posthumously in 2011. A common theory is that Atkinson co-wrote the book with Paul Foster Case and Michael Whitty. This theory is often held by members of Builders of the Adytum (B.O.T.A.), the Mystery School later founded by Case, though it doesn't publicly make this claim. This story appears to have originated with a B.O.T.A. splinter group, the Fraternity of the Hidden Light.Clark, P. (2013).Paul Foster Case. His Life and Works. Covina CA: Fraternity of the Hidden Light, 23. See also for more information. Along these lines, much has been made about Paul Foster Case's being a Freemason, and that The Kybalion's publisher, the Yogi Publication Society, gave its address as \\"Masonic Temple, Chicago IL\\" on the book's frontispiece. However, Chicago's \\"Masonic Temple\\" was also the city's first skyscraper, housing dozens of stores and small businesses without any Masonic affiliations, and named for the Masonic Lodge which financed much of its construction and met in its top few floors. Other names speculatively mentioned as co-authors of The Kybalion include Harriet Case (Paul Foster Case's wife at the time), Mabel Collins (a prominent Theosophical writer), Claude Bragdon (an architect, Theosophist, and writer on \\"mystic geometry\\"), and Claude Alexander (a well- known stage magician, mentalist, proponent of crystal gazing, and New Thought author). Ann Davies, who succeeded Case as head of the B.O.T.A., is often mentioned as a possible Kybalion contributor, but she was born in 1912—four years after the book's first publication. The introduction for a 2011 edition of The Kybalion published by Tarcher/Penguin presents an argument that William Walker Atkinson was the sole author of the work, including evidence such as the 1912 edition of Who's Who in America, which attributes Atkinson as the author, and a 1917 French language edition of The Kybalion in which the translator's introduction attributes the work to \\"the American psychic master W.W. Atkinson.\\" The seven Principles The book devotes a chapter to each of its seven \\"Principles\\", or axioms: =Principle of Mentalism= The Principle of Mentalism embodies the idea that \\"All is Mind.\\" Everything that happens has to be a result of a mental state which precedes it. For anything to exist, thoughts had to form first, which then form physical reality or manifestation. \\"Your thoughts are seeds, plant positive seeds in your mind garden.\\" =Principle of Correspondence= The Principle of Correspondence expresses the idea that there is always a correspondence between the laws of phenomena of the various \\"planes\\" of being and life.Kybalion page 28 As above, so below; as below, so above. This principle states that there is a harmony which can be made, agreement and correspondence between these planes, delineated as: * The Great Physical Plane * The Great Mental Plane * The Great Spiritual Plane =Principle of Vibration= This expounds the idea that motion is manifest in everything in the Universe, that nothing rests, and everything moves, vibrates and circles.Kybalion page 137 This principle explains that the distinction between manifestations of Matter, Energy, Mind, and even Spirit, are the result of only different \\"vibrations\\".Kybalion page 30 The higher a person is on the scale, the higher the rate of vibration will be. Here, The All is said to be at an infinite level of vibration, almost to the point of being at rest. There are said to be millions upon millions of varying degrees between the highest level, The All, and the objects of the lowest vibration.Kybalion page 31 Mental Transmutation is described as the practical application of this principle. To change one's mental state is to change vibration. One may do this by an effort of Will, by means of deliberately \\"fixing the attention\\" upon a more desirable state.Kybalion page 214 =Principle of Polarity= The Principle of Polarity embodies the idea that everything is dual, everything has two poles, and everything has its opposite.Kybalion page 32 All manifested things have two sides, two aspects, or two poles.Kybalion page 149 Everything \\"is\\" and \\"isn't\\" at the same time, all truths are but half truths and every truth is half false, there are two sides to everything, opposites are identical in nature yet different in degree, extremes meet, and all paradoxes may be reconciled.Kybalion pages 149-150 =Principle of Rhythm= The Principle of Rhythm expresses the idea that in everything there is manifested a measured motion, a to and from, a flow and inflow, a swing backward and forward, a pendulum-like movement.Kybalion page 36 There is rhythm between every pair of opposites, or poles, and is closely related to the Principle of Polarity.Kybalion page 159 It can be seen that this Principle enables transition from one pole to the other, and not necessarily poles of extreme opposites. =Principle of Cause and Effect= It explains that there is a cause for every effect, and an effect for every cause.Kybalion page 38 It also states that there is no such thing as chance, that chance is merely a term indicating extant causes not recognized or perceived.Kybalion page 171 The Principle is clarified in the chapter Causation. =Principle of Gender= The Principle of Gender embodies the idea that gender is manifested in everything.Kybalion pages 39-40 The authors state that this does not relate explicitly to the commonly understood notion of sex, but rather \\"... to beget; to procreate, to generate, to create, or to produce...\\" in general.Kybalion page 183 Gender manifests itself on all planes as the Feminine and Masculine principles. Mental Gender is described as a Hermetic concept which relates to the feminine and masculine principles. It does not refer to someone's physical sex, nor does it suggest that someone of a certain sex necessarily has a matching mental gender. Ideally, one wants to have a balanced mental gender.Three Initiates pp. 193-211 The concept put forth in The Kybalion states that gender exists on all planes of existence (Physical, Mental and Spiritual), and represents different aspects on different planes. Everything and everyone contains these two elements or principles.(Three Initiates page 40) The Feminine principle is always in the direction of receiving impressions, and has a much more varied field of operation than the Masculine. The Feminine conducts the work of generating new thoughts, concepts and ideas, including the work of the imagination.(Three Initiates p. 203) The Masculine principle is always in the direction of giving out or expressing, and contents itself with the \\"Will\\" in its varied phases.(Three Initiates page 203) Influences The works of the English philosopher Herbert Spencer are referred to approvingly in The Kybalion as showing an understanding of hermetic principles; and Spencer himself is eulogised as a reincarnation of the 5th century BCE Greek philosopher Heraclitus; who is in turn described as being a reincarnation of a still more ancient, Egyptian philosopher.

Languages The Builders of the Adytum consider The Kybalion an essential foundation of their beliefs, and have translated the original text into Spanish, German and French, the last was completed by André Durville.

Carpi (; ) is an Italian town and comune of about 71,000 inhabitants in the province of Modena, Emilia-Romagna. It is a busy centre for industrial and craft activities and for cultural and commercial exchanges. History The name \\"Carpi\\" is derived from carpinus betulus, a hornbeam tree particularly widespread in medieval times in the Po valley region. In Prehistoric times it was a settlement of the Villanovan Culture. The foundation by the Lombard king Aistulf of St. Mary's church in the castle (Castrum Carpi) in 752 was the first step in the current settlement of the city. From 1319 to 1525 it was ruled by the Pio family, after whom it was acquired by the Este, as part of the Duchy of Modena. The city received a Silver Medal for Military Valour in recognition of its participation in the resistance against the German occupation during World War II. The town has one of the largest squares in all Italy (3rd place), the heart of the city, Piazza dei Martiri. It is surrounded by the castle, the cathedral, the town hall and a 52 arches long portico. Every Thursday and Saturday the square hosts the local market. Carpi used to be the finishing point of the annual Italian Marathon, which begins in nearby Maranello. Almost 1000 athletes enter the senior men's and women's race which has been held every year since 1988 in honor of Dorando Pietri, a long distance runner born in Carpi that lost his Olympic Gold Medal for being helped to stand up after a fall near the finish line. The area was crippled in the earthquakes of May 2012. = Title = As a titular Duke of Modena, the current holder of the title of \\"Prince of Carpi\\" would be Prince Lorenz of Belgium, Archduke of Austria-Este. Geography Located in the northern area of its province, at the borders with the one Reggio Emilia, Carpi borders with the municipalities of Campogalliano, Cavezzo, Correggio (RE), Fabbrico (RE), Modena, Novi di Modena, Rio Saliceto (RE), Rolo (RE), San Prospero and Soliera. It counts the hamlets (frazioni) of Budrione, Cantone di Gargallo, Cibeno Pile, Cortile, Fossoli, Gargallo, Lama di Quartirolo, Migliarina, Osteriola, San Marino, San Martino Secchia and Santa Croce.

The periodical was instrumental in developing and formalizing the individualist anarchist philosophy through publishing essays and serving as a format for debate. Contributors included Tucker, Lysander Spooner, Auberon Herbert, Dyer Lum, Joshua K. Ingalls, John Henry Mackay, Victor Yarros, Wordsworth Donisthorpe, James L. Walker, J. William Lloyd, Voltairine de Cleyre, Steven T. Byington, John Beverley Robinson, Jo Labadie and Henry Appleton. Included in its masthead is a quote from Pierre-Joseph Proudhon saying that liberty is \\"Not the Daughter But the Mother of Order\\".  Purpose  Benjamin Tucker was an American individualist anarchist and made it clear that the purpose of the journal was to further his point of view, saying in the first issue: However, the journal did become a forum for argumentation about diverse views and Tucker credited both Josiah Warren and the social anarchist Proudhon as influences for Liberty. For instance, says of Proudhon the following: \\"Liberty is a journal brought into existence almost as a direct consequences of the teachings of Proudhon\\" (Liberty I). He later said that Liberty was \\"the foremost organ of Josiah Warren's doctrines\\" (Liberty IX).  Revival  In 1974, an attempt to revive Tucker's Liberty was undertaken by some of Laurance Labadie's associates. Edited by Earl Foley and Walter Carroll, it billed itself as \\"The Revival of Liberty\\". The first issue contained articles by Labadie, Lynne Farrow and Earl Foley. Its editorial says: \\"We align ourselves with the Individualist Anarchist tradition of Josiah Warren and Benjamin Tucker\\". However, the revival did not survive past the first issue.\\"Laurance Labadie: Keeper of the Flame\\". In 2007, mutualist archivist Shawn P.

Like Cronenberg's previous feature, Stereo, Crimes was shot silent with a commentary added afterwards. The commentary is spoken by the character Adrian Tripod (Ronald Mlodzik). The film is set in 1997. Summary Crimes of the Future details the wanderings of Adrian Tripod (Ronald Mlodzik), sometime director of a dermatological clinic called the House of Skin, who is searching for his mentor, the mad dermatologist Antoine Rouge. Rouge has disappeared following a catastrophic plague resulting from cosmetic products, which has killed the entire population of sexually mature women. Tripod joins a succession of organisations, including Metaphysical Import-Export and the Oceanic Podiatry Group, and meets various individuals and groups of men who are trying to adjust themselves to a defeminized world. One man parodies childbirth by continually growing new organs which are removed from his body. Eventually Tripod comes upon a group of paedophiles that is holding a 5-year-old girl, and they urge him to mate with her. Tripod senses the presence of Rouge in the girl.

A crooked spire, (also known as a twisted spire) is a tower showing a twist and/or a deviation from the vertical. A church tower usually consists of a square stone tower topped with a pyramidal wooden structure, the spire. The spire is usually clad with slates or lead to protect the wood. Through accident or design the spire may contain a twist, or it may not point perfectly straight upwards. Some however have been built or rebuilt with a deliberate twist, generally as a design choice. There are about a hundred bell towers of this type in Europe. Reasons for spires to twist and bend Twisting can be caused by internal or external forces. Internal conditions, such as green or unseasoned wood, can cause some twisting until after about 50 years when fully seasoned. Also the weight of any lead used in construction can cause the wood to twist. Dry wood will shrink, causing further movement. External forces, such as water ingress that causes rot, can cause partial collapse, resulting in tilting. Heat from the sun on one side can also cause movement. Earthquakes have also occasionally caused twisting. Subsidence can cause leaning. Strong winds have been blamed at times, but there is little evidence to back this up. Finally, weak design can be at fault, for instance with a lack of cross- bracing, resulting in the ability of the tower to move. St Mary's Church in Cleobury Mortimer. One legend relating to Chesterfield says that a virgin once married in the church, and the church was so surprised that the spire turned around to look at the bride. Another version of the myth common in Chesterfield is that the devil twisted the spire when a virgin married in the church, saying that he would untwist it when the next virgin got married there. A third myth says that the devil perched on the spire and twisted his tail around it to hold on, the twist of his tail transmitting to the structure.

Langbein, Thomas P. Gallanis, Lawrence W. Waggoner, Uniform Trust and Estate Statutes (2010), p. 201. There are a number of reasons why a person might wish to avoid an inheritance, particularly if the proceeds would only go to their creditors, or if it would drastically affect their income tax liabilities. Under the common law, a person who disclaimed their interest would be treated as though they had died before the trust or will came into effect. This was a sensible option if the disclaiming party was an heir by descent, whose own children would then take in his place and without the imposition of a gift tax. The disclaimer must be in writing and submitted to the court overseeing the disposition of the estate within a legally specified time period, which is usually nine months after the death of the person from whom the disclaiming party stands to inherit, or twelve months after the creation of a trust by a living person. An affidavit may be required in which the disclaiming party must swear that he has not received any consideration (i.e., compensation) for the disclaimer. The disclaimer must also occur before the disclaiming party has enjoyed any benefits of the trust or inheritance. Many jurisdictions now have statutes that prohibit a disclaimer when the individual is insolvent or receiving certain public benefits due to low income. A disclaimer of interest is irrevocable. It must be a complete, and not a partial disclaimer. Such a disclaimer can be made by a legal guardian on behalf of a person who lacks the capacity to make the disclaimer themselves, but this usually requires the finding by a court that the disclaimer is in the ward's best interest.  Disclaimers and deeds of variation: England and Wales  In England and Wales, a disclaimer is likewise irrevocable and covers the entire testamentary gift. It may be a unilateral act but should be communicated in writing to the persons administering the estate. It does not need to be registered with the court; the persons administering the estate are obliged to retain the communication as they may be required to provide an account to the court of their actions in the administration. A similar effect to a disclaimer (including for inheritance tax and capital gains tax purposes) can be achieved with a greater degree of flexibility through the use of a \\"deed of variation\\" (or \\"deed of family arrangement\\"). A person or persons due to inherit property may enter into such a deed with the personal representatives (executors or administrators of an intestate estate) and redirect property due to the persons entering into the deed to whomsoever they wish. However, one cannot vary one's entitlement under a deed of variation. A deed of variation may be revocable or irrevocable. Disclaimers and deeds of variation may be overturned by the bankruptcy court and assets traced. Disclaimer of other interests In addition to the more typical disclaimer under wills, an individual may also be able to disclaim his interest as the beneficiary of a life insurance policy or employee benefit plans. It may also apply to concurrent interests in real property that automatically transfer after death by operation of law rather than by the rules of inheritance (such as joint tenancies or tenancies by the entirety).

Two years later he published his first work, Das Rheinische Ubergangsgebirge (1844), in which he dealt with the older rocks and fossils. In 1845 he paid a visit to America, and devoted a year and a half to a careful study of the geology of Texas and other Southern states. He published at Bonn in 1849 a general work entitled Texas, while the results of his investigations of the Cretaceous rocks and fossils were published three years later in a treatise, Die Kreidebildungen von Texas und ihre organischen Einschlusse (1852), which also included a general account of the geology, and gained for him the title Father of the geology of Texas. Subsequently, he published at Breslau Die Silurische Fauna des westlichen Tennessee (1860). During the preparation of these works he was from 1847 to 1855 privatdocent at Bonn, and was then appointed professor of geology, palaeontology and mineralogy in the University of Breslau, a post which he held with signal success as a teacher until his death. As a palaeontologist he made important contributions to our knowledge especially of the vertebrates of the Devonian and older rocks. He assisted H. G. Bronn with the third edition of the Lethaea geognostica (1851–56), and subsequently he labored on an enlarged and revised edition, of which he published one section, Lethaea palaeozoica (1876-1883). In 1862 he was called on to superintend the preparation of a geological map of Upper Silesia, and the results of his researches were embodied in his Geologie von Oberschlesien (3 vols., 1870). As a mineralogist he was likewise well known, more particularly by his practical teachings and by the collection he formed in the Museum at Breslau. He died at Breslau on 14 December 1891.

After several mergers with tertiary art institutions it became part of the University for the Creative Arts in 2008.  Background  Before 1900 Britain was famous for its Arts and Crafts movement, a style of architecture and interior design practiced at the then School of Art,'Local and District News,' The Hampshire Advertiser, Saturday, 12 Jan 1878, p.6 and which was influential on western design leading up to Modernism, the latter propounded in the German Bauhaus, particularly their use of a \\"Preliminary\\" course to change students' basic thinking. That was widely replicated in British art schools as a \\"Foundation\\" course.Gillian Naylor, The Bauhaus, Studio Vista, 1968, (London), page 55 After World War II the British Government realized that British design was less popular than American and Swiss design.  History  The Guildford Working Men's Institute was a successor to the Guildford Institute which itself was formed on 14 June 1843 out of a union of the Mechanics' Institute founded in 1834 and the Literary and Scientific Institution, founded in 1835. By 1859 the Institute had 541 students.Report of the Department of Science and Art of the Committee of Council on Education: with appendix : presented to both Houses of Parliament by command of Her Majesty. (1854). United Kingdom: H.M. Stationery Office. In 1892 the Guildford Institute and the Guildford Working Men's Institution were amalgamated under the title of the Guildford and Working Men's Institution offering both technical and art classes. The Guildford Institute and the Science, Art and Technical classes run by Surrey County Council separated in 1910. In 1939, the institution, then known as the School of Art, moved into Stoke Park Mansion. The school had once enjoyed a reputation as a major centre of photographic excellence under the Head of Photography, Ifor Thomas. Among his students were Jane Bown, John Hedgecoe, John Cleare, and Ray Dean. Staff included Thurston Hopkins. One of the part-time staff, always critical to the intellectual and creative health of the school, was Alfred Lammer. Guildford School of Art had a photography department and in 1957 was referred to as \\"Guildford School of Art and Photography\\",Manchester Guardian, Wednesday 08 May 1957, p.7 and that year students' work Portrait of a Town featuring the people and buildings of Guildford, was shown at the Royal Institute of British Architects in London. Its Printing Department was popular with printing companies. It had an excellent complementary studies department headed by a fine artist and with many art historians, broadcast scriptwriters and published authors on the staff who taught students to think critically about the world around them. Alan Coleman, a sculptor, who had studied at Goldsmiths' College School of Art and the Royal College of Art, was Principal of Guildford School of Art from 1956 - 65. In 1966 the school was inspected by the Summerson committeehttp://vads.ac.uk/diad/article.php?year=1968&title;=2&article;=d.265.32/ on behalf of the National Council for Diplomas in Art and Design (NCDAD)http://dscalm.warwick.ac.uk/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=DServe3.ini&dsqApp;=Archive&dsqDb;=Catalog&dsqCmd;=Document.tcl&dsqItem;=NCD.pdf/ which was charged with deciding which art schools were capable of awarding degree-equivalent Diplomas in Art and Design. The committee concluded that Guildford School of Art would not be accredited to offer the Diplomas. Surrey County Council invited Professor Lewis Elton of the University of Surrey to assess the school independently. Elton reached the same conclusion as the Summerson committee. Surrey County Council then decided that the School would award a \\"Guildford Diploma\\". Students protested in 1968 about the quality of education at the School. A large number of the staff were dismissed. In 1969 the School merged with Farnham College of Art to become the West Surrey College of Art and Design. The Epsom School of Art & Design and West Surrey College of Art & Design merged to form Surrey Institute of Art & Design in 1995. The Kent Institute of Art & Design and Surrey Institute of Art & Design and University College merged to form University College for the Creative Arts at Canterbury, Epsom, Farnham, Maidstone & Rochester in 2005. The University College for the Creative Arts at Canterbury, Epsom, Farnham, Maidstone & Rochester received its University Title from the Privy Council and was renamed the University for the Creative Arts in 2008.  Student unrest and staff dismissals  In 1968 student unrest began in response to underfunding, quality and qualifications of teachers, dissatisfaction with the principal, ceramicist Tom Arnold, and certification of graduate qualifications; the school offered a \\"Guildford Diploma\\", falsely believed to be a degree-level qualification. A 1969 brochure for 3D Design Dept. at Pewley described the Interior Design Dept. as offering a (WSCAD student 69-71) qualification affiliated to RIBA. Against a background of a period of student protest across Europe and America, students held a 'sit-in'.British Journal of Photography 13-Sep-1968. Article by John Walmsley \\"The Guildford Sit-In\\"pp. 782-4 On 5 June the students occupied the refectory and spent many days writing a proposal to the principal Tom Arnold demanding changes. The proposal was backed by a majority of the staff, the students' parents and many eminent artists. Jack Straw, the newly elected President of the National Union of Students (NUS) and later the Foreign Secretary visited the School and tried to persuade the students to end their protest. The support for the Guildford students by the NUS was limited but Straw would later help to raise the issue in the press. As Tom Arnold was unable to contain the protest and end the sit- in, the Governors began issuing writs to the striking students on 11 June. Tom Arnold approached the students and offered to set up departmental panels to resolve the issue but students rejected the proposal. On 3 July the staff held a meeting at an hotel near the School. The School Registrar accompanied by Police entered uninvited and handed them writs requiring them to appear before a Judge on Monday 8 October. On 6 October the students locked the building and Council representatives shouted at them through a loudhailer to leave by 11:30. SCC sent letters to thirty four students warning them of consequences if they stayed. The students stayed. Questions began to be asked in the House of Commons. On 9 July a letter from a number of noted academic. writers and artists including David Hockney was published in the Times. It was the first of many and would eventually lead to the collapse of SCC's case and a Public Enquiry. On 14 July the Chairman of the Governors offered to rescind the students' suspension if the students agreed to leave. The students stayed. SCC went to the High Court and asked for a temporary order that twenty nine of the students leave the School. It was refused because the request had not been made by the entire Council (many councillors were on holiday. All SCC members were recalled. On 29 July, after an eight-week sit-in, the students left the building. On 30 July Tony Heath asked amidst shouting how much ratepayers money had been spent on hiring security guards. He praised the students some of whom cheered him from the public gallery. The security guard company \\"Interstate Security\\" was a \\"shelf\\" company which was quickly wound up. The school reopened in the autumn of 1968. A Select Committee enquiry was eventually launched in 1970 and the vice-Principal Bernard Brett, was dismissed. The Principal Tom Arnold became head of the united Guildford and Farnham Schools of Art until he left in 1974 and went to Australia. Twenty eight part-time teachers, including eight from the Complementary Studies department who had been teaching in the school since 1951, including its Head, John Kashdan, were informed on 8 August that their contracts would not be renewed, removing almost all Complementary Studies and Foundation Departments teachers. Many were members of the Association of Teachers in Technical Institutions (ATTI). On 10 August, Eric Moonman MP for Billericay, made the first of what would become many appeals to the Education Secretary Edward Short to hold a public enquiry into Guildford School of Art, On 14 August the Governors suspended seven of the Complementary Studies staff aligned with the students. A week later students' parents formed their own committee to pressurize the SCC. Their leader Mr. Colin Ferguson said \\"The students have been baulked at every step. They have behaved in an extremely democratic and constitutional way\\". The next day the Governors closed the building, but the students stayed in. The Governors installed security guards who having talked to the students, sided with them, one, James Teelan, saying \\"We have just about had enough. The students are law-abiding citizens and are doing no harm … Our sympathies are now wholly with the students. They are causing no trouble … From what I can gather, the firm's idea was to build up the force of security men gradually and without the students suspecting, so that they could be ousted. I could not bring myself to be part of it\\". Councillor Tony Heathhttp://www.slideshare.net/orkedfaudzan/danger-in-32368979/ also sided with the students. Hampshire County Council, having withdrawn a £9-a-week grant from a student, Sally Williams, at the request of SCC realized this might be illegal, restituted it. Fifty parents asked the Governors not to victimise students or staff. The Governors said nothing but brought an injunction against the security guards and cut off the electricity to the College. The students hired a generator and remained on the premises. On 16 August the ATTI echoed Moonman's appeal to Short. Short refused, but by 22 August the SCC, realising that were ATTI to boycott them, recruiting new staff to replace the total of forty-two dismissed staff would face union action, agreed to discuss the sackings in September. SCC had claimed that the sackings were only due to the need for economies but started to advertise for new staff in the Photographic department. By 19 September SCC were talking of an offer of compensation to the 7 full-time staff who had been sacked. The School reopened but a student was victimised by being told to stay away by SCC. Her parents were members of the parents association which had opposed the Governors and SCC. Tom Arnold reinstated her. SCC employed twenty-five new staff, none of whom was a member of ATTI. In October the Guildford Trades Council added their voice to the growing demand for a public enquiry. By 12 October with the confirmation of the dismissal of the seven full-time staff by SCC, Jack Straw added to the call for a public enquiry. Sir John Summerson, chairman of the National Council for Diplomas in Art and Design found the decision to sack the staff \\"deplorable\\". By November the ATTI had blacklisted Guildford School of Art and was threatening to blacklist all other art establishments under SCC control. 50 students started a 24-hour sit-in at Guildford School of Art in protest against the way it was reorganised and being run and demanding the reinstatement of the sacked staff. Tom Arnold met 130 parents of students but refused to answer their questions about the staff sackings, the sit-in or the restructuring of the School. On 12 December 5 members of the Select Committee on Education and Science started their own enquiry led by Christopher Price MP. The questions elicited the history of friction at Guildford School of Art and the secrecy surrounding the amalgamation with Farnham School of Art.Student Relations: Report. -. (1969). United Kingdom: H.M. Stationery Office.

The following term another student was victimised by the SCC until the Minister of Education intervened. The Liberal Party also called for a public enquiry. In October 1969, the Select Committee reported that there was indeed a \\"prima facie case for a public enquiry at Guildford School of Art\\". SCC immediately rejected the call. On the second anniversary of the sit-in Moonman again called for a public enquiry., and was supported in a letter to the The Times signed by David Hockney, Peter Sellers, C Day Lewis and many other noted artists, writers, politicians and academics. In September the dispute was referred to the Department of Employment. In May 1971, Henry Moore, Shirley Williams and others wrote to The Times asking for the Secretary of State for Science and Education to intervene in an effort to resolve the long-standing dispute. By mid-June 1971 there was a sign of a thaw: SCC agreed to discuss compensation with ATTI and an agreement was reached by the end of June. Seven full-time lecturers were to be re-employed by Surrey County Council.

The lake is a major attraction for those engaging in watersports, with a number of tourist parks and accommodation facilities available. Permissible activities on the lake include high-speed boating, water skiing, sailing, canoeing, fishing and swimming. The lake water levels were low for approximately eight years between 2002 and 2010 during a prolonged drought, which restricted the amount of recreational activity until rainfall in the latter half of 2010 returned the lake to 100 percent capacity. A speed restriction of 5 knots is placed on the lake when the level falls below 16 percent or . Camping is permitted only in caravan parks and/or on private land surrounding the lake with a permit from the land owner. Built between 1961 and 1964, Lake Eppalock remains the only water storage on the Campaspe River system. The lake was full in August 2000 then ran dry over two years, to 2002. It remained below 15 percent for 8 years due to drought. The reservoir rose from 8 percent in June 2010, to full capacity by November. The lake overflowed its spillway for the first time since 1996, on 28 November 2010, after significant rainfall over the preceding 48 hours.

A Commodore 64 port followed in 1992 and an Amiga CD32 version in 1994. The game was subsequently published by Krisalis Software for the Acorn Archimedes. Virgin Interactive published the game for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, Master System, and the Game Gear. Sony Imagesoft published the game for the Sega Mega-CD, Super NES, and Game Boy. The character of Chuck Rock was an early mascot for Core Design before the introduction of Lara Croft in the 1996 game Tomb Raider, and the character of Chuck Rock himself and his family even featured in some UK comic books of the 1990s. Chuck Rock spawned two video game sequels. Plot The setting of the game is a fantasy prehistorical Stone Age-era world that is shared by both neanderthals, woolly mammoth, saber-tooth tigers, dinosaurs, and various assorted wild primeval monsters such as prehistoric mammals, giant insects, human-eating plants, and other exotica; thus, the setting is similar to that of films such as One Million Years B.C., or television shows such as The Flintstones or Dinosaurs. The eponymous Chuck Rock is an overweight, square-jawed caveman characterized by loutish and lewd behaviour perhaps influenced by the lad culture of the 1990s. Chuck has a limited vocabulary (his favourite phrase being \\"Unga Bunga\\" and not much else), has a balding head cut into a punk-style mohawk, eats whole dinosaur- steaks raw in one bite, and has a penchant for picking up rocks and throwing them at things, hence his name. Chuck is a guitarist and singer (or shouter) in a rock band along with some other cavemen, his attractive wife Ophelia Rock, and a long-haired dinosaur bass player; and whilst on stage he wears a long wig to hide his balding head. One day, Ophelia Rock is kidnapped by jealous local bully Garry Gritter (a pun on the name of contemporary pop star Gary Glitter) and carried off to Gritter's hang-out in the creepy dinosaur graveyard. Chuck must go to her rescue, searching for her in primeval jungles, swamps, lakes, an ice-capped mountain top, caves, and even the insides of a gigantic dinosaur. Gameplay Some dinosaurs will assist Chuck, such as the brontosaurus that helps Chuck across a swamp, although almost all dinosaurs encountered will attack Chuck. The game was notable for the major form of defense, which was to belly bounce with Chuck's beer belly, and for the catchphrase \\"unga bunga!\\" which was shouted by Chuck at the start of each level. Alternatively the character could pick up and \\"chuck\\" rocks at opponents. There is also a puzzle element to the game, as certain rocks are used to reach high areas. Health is indicated by the size of a heart icon. Health and score can be raised by finding dinosaur steaks and eating them. There is a boss at the end of each level. ReceptionLegacy A direct sequel came in 1993 in the form of Chuck Rock II: Son of Chuck, which was also ported to several consoles like its predecessor. Chuck Rock II: Son of Chuck was more aimed at a younger audience than its predecessor, and the player character was not actually Chuck Rock himself but his infant son, Chuck Junior. It was not as well received by fans. Nonetheless around the time of the game's release, Core commissioned a comic strip in the long-running UK children's magazine LookIn, centering on the day-to-day lives of Chuck, Ophelia and Junior. As a meta-referential joke, Chuck Jr owned a 'SteggaDrive' console, as a reference to the Mega Drive name. A year later the magazine was closed (after almost 25 years), and the final strip saw Chuck being swept away from his boat, presumed dead but washing up on a tribal island and being revered as a God - as an inexplicable comic touch, mourners at his 'funeral' included then-Prime-Minister John Major. A spin-off to Chuck Rock came in the game BC Racers, released later in the same year as Chuck Rock II: Son of Chuck. BC Racers was released on the Mega-CD, Sega 32X and 3DO, and the format was changed from that of a platformer to that of a racing game. The game was designed by Toby Gard, who later created Lara Croft. BC Racers retained the characters of Chuck Rock as well as his son Chuck Junior. Other prehistoric racers include Millstone Rockafella, Brick Jagger and Jimi Handtrix. The game was generally well received among the fans of the consoles in question, and BC Racers was named the Best Sega CD Driving/Racing Game of the Year in GameFan's 1994 \\"Megawards\\" (Vol 3, Iss. 1). BC Racers was released as freeware two years later for the PC. Core promised an updated version of Chuck Rock for a next generation console, although it never materialized.

In 2000, he purchased Crystal Palace Football Club and remained chairman of the club until administration in early 2010. In 2002, he co-founded and funded the car Magazine Octane, selling his 50% shareholding in 2006. In 2006, he opened the restaurant Club Bar and Dining in London's Warwick Street, Jordan sold it to the Ottenlenghi Group in 2010 who renamed the restaurant Nopi. Early life At 16, Jordan joined Palace and then Chelsea on schoolboy forms, but his career never took off, and Chelsea released him when he was sixteen. He has described himself as being \\"good enough to be a professional, but mentally I wasn't interested. You often get players who have bags of talent, but not the required application. I was one of them.\\" All this happened whilst he was at Purley High School for Boys in Old Coulsdon. His father Peter Jordan used to play for Crystal Palace F.C., although never appeared for the first team. In the late 1980s or early 1990s he was invited by a friend, James Wright, to join him in his business, Wright Connections, selling mobile phones via adverts placed in Loot and Exchange and Mart. Jordan and Wright rented an office from Delta 5, another mobile phone dealer, and the business lasted for a short time before changing its name to Corporate Cellular Ltd (CCL). This business was not considered to be a great success either and Jordan left in the early 1990s. In 1994, Jordan and Andrew Briggs set up their own mobile phone retail company called the Pocket Phone Shop. They started with £30,000 and a unit in Slough, and after forming an agreement with service provider Astec, the business flourished. By 2000 the Pocket Phone Shop had 208 outlets nationwide, employed 1100 staff and was forecasting a turnover of £102m for the 1999/00 financial year. Pocket Phone Shop was seen as one of the main rivals in its sector to leader The Carphone Warehouse – the organisation that Jordan and Briggs both worked for before launching their own venture. At its peak the Pocket Phone Shop enlisted the services of Ulrika Jonsson to promote its new store openings, but the relationship turned sour when Jordan sued Jonsson claiming she had not fulfilled her promotional activities. It is unknown what the outcome of this action was. Crystal Palace Jordan and Briggs left Pocket Phone Shop in 2000 after selling the company to One2One for £73m. That year, Singapore financier Jerry Lim bought Crystal Palace Football Club, a club that had been hours from extinction, from the administrators, and immediately sold the club to Jordan. Then aged 32, Jordan immediately appointed himself chairman, making him the youngest chairman of a Football League club. Having been born \\"100 yards from the ground\\" Jordan had been a lifelong fan, and he noted \\"I have achieved exactly what I set out to do, and that is to be Chairman of Crystal Palace. I have been prepared to put my money into something I truly believe in, and my first job is to turn the fortunes of this club around.\\" Jordan also vowed that the club would be promoted to the Premiership, within five years. However, despite owning the club, Jordan did not own the ground, which belonged to Ron Noades, who had been chairman until 1998. Jordan caused a storm in July 2008 by announcing his plans to sell the club and move away from football altogether, stating he had \\"been disillusioned with football for a long time\\". This occurred following a Football Association tribunal's decision on the John Bostock transfer to Tottenham Hotspur left Jordan to declare \\"It's a panel of halfwits\\". Palace were awarded only £700k, having valued Bostock at £5m. No potential buyers came forward to make a bid for Palace, and the club have become embroiled in deep financial trouble. Rumours persist of personal financial difficulties as Jordan faced \\"cashflow\\" problems relating to wage payments at the club in November and December 2009. On 26 January 2010 Crystal Palace went into administration and Jordan's ownership came to an end. =Managers= Jordan gained a reputation as a manager-killer early in his Palace reign, though this changed as his reign progressed. Between 2000 and 2003 no fewer than the following five managers departed the manager's post: Steve Coppell (August 2000), Alan Smith (April 2001), Steve Bruce (November 2001), Trevor Francis (April 2003), and Steve Kember (November 2003). Of these, only Coppell and Bruce left of their own accord, with Coppell's departure brought about by a personality clashJordan has stated \\"Steve Coppell and I just didn't get on\\" (i), and Coppell has stated \\"I didn't feel comfortable with Simon Jordan and neither did he with me.\\"(ii) *(i) *(ii) and Bruce's resignation leading to a high court case. Iain Dowie was appointed in December 2003 and the club bounded up the table from the relegation zone to win promotion in May 2004, beating West Ham United at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium in the play-off final, fulfilling Jordan's promise of promotion within five years. However, the club remained in the Premier League for just one season before being narrowly relegated in 2005. In May 2006, having accepted Dowie and Jordan had differences but the same goal, Dowie left the club by mutual consent. However, towards the end of the month Dowie joined Charlton Athletic as their new manager, prompting Jordan to issue a legal writ against him, claiming Dowie had lied about his reasons for departure. Peter Taylor, an ex-Palace player was installed on 13 June 2006. However, his reign would last just 16 months, ending on 8 October 2007 with the sack. Jordan stated he wanted Taylor to be remembered as a good player for Palace rather than a bad manager. On 11 October at a press conference he unveiled Neil Warnock as the new manager, which failed to surprise many as the two were reported to be good friends. Jordan's choice appeared to have been a good one, since the club embarked on a superb run of form that saw them move from the relegation places into the 2007–08 season play-offs, but the relationship between the pair ended in a dispute after Warnock left the club to join Queens Park Rangers following the Eagles' entering administration. =Dowie Court Case= Jordan succeeded in his High Court battle against Dowie, with The Hon. Mr Justice Tugendhat ruling that Dowie had lied when negotiating his way out of his contract at Palace. Dowie won the right to appeal against that decision, leading to it being heard in the Court of Appeal. In April 2008, Crystal Palace F.C settled out of court with Iain Dowie, and issued the following statement. > \\"Prior to appeal being heard a mutually satisfactory settlement of all > matters has now been reached on terms acceptable to Crystal Palace Football > Club\\" =Selhurst Park= In October 2006 Jordan claimed to have purchased the freehold to Selhurst Park from Ron Noades for £12m, using an investment mechanism that kept his identity secret. He claimed the obfuscation had been necessary due to the \\"very, very difficult\\" relationship he had with Noades. Palace were now seen to be safe for the future. It later transpired that the freehold had been bought by the company Selhurst Park Limited, which was owned by another company. A maze of ownership finally showed the legal ownership being 60% Paul Kemsley and 40% a venture capital company owned by HBOS. Simon Jordan has since offered the freehold for sale with the intention of taking back a long lease on the property. Simon Jordan's exact position on the freehold was unknown, although Jordan later agreed a 25-year lease for Selhurst Park. Selhurst Park Limited later went into administration (separate from Crystal Palace Football Club's own administration), leading to the stadium being purchased by the CPFC 2010 consortium, led by Steve Parish at the same time as the consortium buying Crystal Palace F.C. Career as a columnist As of the 2005–06 season, Jordan wrote a fortnightly column for The Observer newspaper. A particular column, written by Jordan, led to him being charged by the Football Association with bringing the game into disrepute. The case was heard on 7 December 2005 with a charge of improper conduct proven. Jordan was given a suspended fine of £10,000. But, backed by other journalists and by media advisor Max Clifford, Jordan indicated his intention to appeal, stating \\"I didn't start this fight, but it's not something I'm going to walk away from.\\". His appeal was heard on 10 April, and was rejected by the three-member panel, two votes to one. Jordan commented in his 16 March column in The Observer that he and his advisors were \\"now considering taking this through the courts. Any legal action I take won't be about wasting time or resources on a petty point of principle – it'd be an attempt to see the whole thing unravel.\\" Jordan also used the column to highlight the inconsistencies in the F.A. disciplinary panel. The same panel decided no disciplinary action would be taken against Paul Jewell, manager of Wigan, who had been charged on the basis of making comments similar to Jordan's. Jordan described the compliance process as being \\"based on mood\\", noting: \\"There's no frame of reference, no consistency – and, yes, it's personal. It amounts to me not being able to say a referee is incompetent while others can, using the same language.\\" Whilst awaiting the outcome of the appeal, it appeared as though the events were having an effect upon him, as on 26 February 2006 it was reported by The News of the World newspaper that Jordan was tired of being chairman, and wanted to go back to being a regular fan. He has since reported in his 5 March 2006 Observer column that he was misquoted and that he had simply restated what he had said eight months before, that \\"I don't plan to stay at Palace or in football all my life. I'd like to return to the stands 'as quickly as possible', but I won't sell until I've secured a sound legacy – Premiership football and a new ground\\" Jordan did not continue writing for the Observer in the 2006–07 season. Television work Aside from appearances in football-related programmes, Jordan's first major TV appearance was in early 2007, appearing in Fortune: Million Pound Giveaway for ITV along with fellow millionaires the Ann Summers managing director Jacqueline Gold (daughter of West Ham chairman David Gold, a personal enemy of Jordan's); entrepreneur Duncan Bannatyne; MOBO Awards founder Kanya King; and former Conservative Member of Parliament-turned-novelist Jeffrey Archer. In May 2019, Jordan appeared on BBC's Question Time. Film production In 2008, Jordan produced the film Telstar based on the play about the life of record producer Joe Meek. The film followed Jordan's production of the play of the same title at London's New Ambassadors Theatre. The film was solely funded by Jordan and featured Kevin Spacey, James Corden and JJ Feild. It was a critical success but only opened in 45 screens in the UK. In 2006, Jordan part-funded and executive-produced Sweeney Todd, a television film starring Ray Winstone and Tom Hardy. Author In 2012 Simon Jordan published an account of his life, an autobiography \\"Be Careful What You Wish For\\". The book recounts his business success in the cellular phone business, but mostly focuses on his time as the youngest ever owner of a professional football club as chairman of Crystal Palace Football Club. The book was a critical success and commercial, it was published by Random House achieved an award at The British Sport books awards and was a finalist in the William Hill sports awards, Personal life It was reported by the Daily Mirror's website in January 2006 that Jordan had bought girlfriend Meg Mathews (the former wife of Oasis guitarist Noel Gallagher) a Porsche worth £100,000 for Christmas, along with a personalised number plate, and that the couple had been together since July 2005. However Jordan gave details of the ending of this relationship in March 2006, admitting that it had been Mathews who had ended the relationship, while attacking the News of the World, which had reported that Jordan had \\"ditched Mathews\\" the week before. Jordan wrote of the matter in his Observer column, \\"the piece belittled someone who has been very important to me over the last nine months.\\" In June 2006, a woman accused of stalking Jordan, Tara Stout, 36, posed in a Union Jack bikini and high heels, then put on tiny shorts and a revealing top to face Bow Street Magistrates Court in Central London over a case regarding Jordan. The pair also faced each other in court in October of that year, when Stout was found guilty of harassing Jordan. Jordan has a daughter with his ex partner Suzi Walker, a girl called Cameron, born in January 2008. On 21 March 2018 at about 13:00 GMT, Jordan was robbed of his £100,000 watch during a gunpoint robbery in Croydon, South London. Jordan has resided in Marbella and London. Jordan is in a relationship with business woman and Broadcaster Michelle Dewberry a fact regularly referenced on his social media.Twitter References Category:English businesspeople Category:English football chairmen and investors Category:Crystal Palace F.C. directors and chairmen Category:People from Thornton Heath Category:Crystal Palace Baltimore Category:1967 births Category:Living people ","title":"Simon Jordan"},{"id":"2287537","title":"Battle of the Basque Roads"},{"id":"2287538","text":"Camphuysen is a Dutch surname and the name of a 17th-century family of painters: *Dirk Rafaelsz Camphuysen (1586–1627), Dutch painter, poet and theologian *Govert Dircksz Camphuysen (1624–1672), Dutch animal painter, son of Dirk *Joachim Govertsz Camphuysen (1601–1659), Dutch landscape painter, brother of Rafaël, nephew of Dirk *Rafaël Govertsz Camphuysen (1597–1657), Dutch landscape painter, brother of Joachim, nephew of Dirk See also *Jan Kamphuijsen (1760–1841), Dutch painter *Kamphuis, Dutch surname Category:Dutch-language surnames ","title":"Camphuysen"},{"id":"2287544","text":"The drawer test is used in the initial clinical assessment of suspected rupture of the cruciate ligaments in the knee.

While not featured on the cover, the Wrecking Crew's first appearance is in The Defenders #17 (Nov 1974). Fictional team history The Wrecking Crew are formed when Dirk Garthwaite—the Wrecker—is approached by Dr. Eliot Franklin in prison and asked to retrieve a gamma bomb Franklin had designed, with the intent of ransoming New York for millions of dollars. The Wrecker had formerly been a violent criminal who demolished crime scenes with his crowbar, but gained his power when he was mistaken for Loki and given mystical powers by Karnilla the Norn Queen. Garthwaite manages to retrieve his enchanted crowbar, and during a lightning storm tells Franklin and fellow prisoners Henry Camp and Brian Calusky to grip the weapon simultaneously. A lightning bolt then strikes the crowbar, increases the Wrecker's power and transforms him and the other three men into the Wrecking Crew. They promptly escape from prison and, in the course of searching for the gamma bomb, are defeated by the Defenders and Luke Cage.Defenders #17–19 Over the years the Wrecking Crew have followed a very familiar cycle—escape from prison, fight (and subsequently lose to) superheroes, and be returned to prison. The Wrecking Crew have battled the Avengers, Captain America, Iron Fist, the Runaways, Spider-Man, Namor the Sub-Mariner, the Thing, Doctor Strange, Daredevil, Alpha Flight, the She-Hulk and the X-Men, but their main foe is Thor. When the Wrecking Crew first battle Thor, they are confident that it will be a quick victory. Thor, however, infuriated by the fact that one of the Wrecker's offensives has killed an innocent bystander, defeats them all in moments and critically injures the Wrecker.Thor #304 Thunderball escapes and, several weeks later, recovers the Wrecker's crowbar, going on to form his own gang before being defeated by Spider-Man.Amazing Spider-Man #248 The Wrecking Crew is later chosen by the being known as the Beyonder to participate in the Secret Wars against a team of select superheroes.Marvel Super-Heroes Secret Wars #1–12 The Wrecking Crew's most notorious act was to participate in the near-fatal beating of the hero Hercules during a siege of Avengers Mansion by the fourth incarnation of Masters of Evil.

The Wrecking Crew's most despicable act was murdering nearly everyone inside a Canadian bar all because of an \\"annoying\\" cell phone ringtone. They then join forces with the mythical Great Beasts and battle the superhero team Omega Flight.Omega Flight #1–5 After being defeated by Omega Flight, they are imprisoned in a jail in Manitoba, but manage to escapeMarvel Comics Presents #5 and return to the United States, where they are recruited to join the Hood's crime syndicate.New Avengers #32–37 The Wrecking Crew were later hired by Jigsaw to kill the Punisher during Jigsaw's revenge plot against him.

It was written by Frank Miller and drawn by Walt Simonson. Plot Using elements from both the RoboCop and Terminator universes, the comic book series begins with Skynet sending three Terminators back in time to Detroit to protect a troubled RoboCop from a lone human soldier also sent back to destroy him. Discovering that the technology used to build him is partly responsible for the future development of Skynet, RoboCop sets out to take down Skynet in the post-apocalyptic future single- handedly. Part of the story focuses on his mind, the only part left of him, hiding and moving throughout Skynet's systems, fighting back as best he can. RoboCop's human consciousness (Alex Murphy) waits for decades in hiding deep within Skynet's \\"consciousness\\", avoiding detection as the slaughter of humanity takes place. He waits for the opportunity when Skynet's attention will be focused on other matters with the war against the humans for him to make a move. A human assault allows Murphy to create a Terminator body that resembles his old form. He makes his escape and is nearly destroyed by human resistance fighters. He identifies himself as an ally and, after gaining their confidence, begins to plot to destroy Skynet with them. =Human allies= As the planning continues, the humans devise a final assault on the central location where Skynet is being housed. They realize that they do not have the manpower to complete their assault. One of the humans asks RoboCop how he was able to build his body. Upon explaining how he accomplished this, the human asks him why he could not do the same thing many times over. The group begins their assault on the Skynet compound and it is evident that they will not succeed when a buzzing is heard from behind them. The original RoboCop has succeeded in not only replicating, but improving himself. A swarm of flying RoboCops (in a different fashion than in RoboCop 3) descend upon the battle and turn the tide. While the battle rages on outside the facility, the original RoboCop sneaks into the facility and shuts down Skynet. He then surrounds himself in a blob of the human flesh that covers the Terminators in order to travel back to the past before the appearance of the original Terminators. Upon the appearance of the strange blob in the present, the people are confused and then terrified as the metal RoboCop tears forth from the mass of flesh and immediately blasts off into space. He finds the earliest iteration of Skynet (which in this story is a spy satellite) and destroys it. Upon the explosion of the satellite, he immediately disappears as the caption explains that this version of RoboCop would never have existed without Skynet. The story ends with the RoboCop of modern times feeling a sense of peace without any inner turmoil from the beginning of the story, returning to the police headquarters for a much-needed rest. Video game A video game loosely based on the comic was released for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Sega Game Gear, and the Nintendo Game Boy. A platformer tie-in game for the Nintendo Entertainment System was also produced, but was ultimately cancelled; the ROM for it has since been distributed online. The Genesis version was awarded Bloodiest Game of 1993 by Electronic Gaming Monthly. Collected editions The four issues, including stiff cardboard inserts intended as pull-out cut-outs, were bound together with a new cover as an \\"exclusive\\" collection by Diamond Comics.

It was the 18th entry in the Ultra Series. The series aired on Tokyo Broadcasting System, including TBS, CBC, MBS, etc. The show ran from October 2, 2004 until June 25, 2005, with a total of 37 broadcast episodes. Subsequent DVD releases from Bandai Visual saw a brand new 45-minute Episode EX and an extended 45-minute Director's Cut of Episode 29. On April 24, 2017, Toku announced that the series would be broadcast in the United States on its channel beginning May 9, 2017 until June 2, 2017.  History  Ultraman Nexus was part of Tsuburaya Productions' Ultra N Project, an experiment in 2004 to re-invent Ultraman for a new generation of fans. Prior to this, however, Tsuburaya had begun a project called Ultra Collaboration 2 at the end of 2003, which involved a brand-new radio adaptation of Ultra Q called The Ultra Q Club. The project was also due to include a new TV series called Ultraman Noa in early 2004, which is presumably what Ultraman Nexus evolved into. Following the success of the new radio show, Tsuburaya forged a brand-new season, Ultra Q: Dark Fantasy on April 6, 2004, a show which attracted top-rung directors such as Shusuke Kaneko (popular with fans for his work on the Gamera series and Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack). The first stage of the Ultra N Project was entitled Noa: Nostalgia. The project mascot, Ultraman Noa, was a rather radical change design - an all-silver Ultraman with protruding wings on its back. Ultraman Noa was mainly used for live stage shows and merchandising. The second stage of the project was Next: Evolution. This saw the creation of a new theatrical film, ULTRAMAN. The final stage was Nexus: Trinity - the piece that ties the entire project together. Unlike the previous series Ultraman Cosmos, which was strictly aimed at young children, Ultraman Nexus was the first Ultraman TV series specifically aimed at adults. The show abandons the traditional monster-of-the-week stories in order to be replaced with longer character-based story arcs. Tsuburaya Productions had intended the show to be run during prime time, but the CBC network gave the show a 7:30 AM Saturday morning slot once Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon ended its 49-episode run. The TV series received weak ratings which were attributed to the change in style and not being able to have the target demographic tune in, resulting in the series being cut short from around 50 episodes down to 37. Three months after its initial run, it was re- run in a new time slot. This time the show aired at 2:30 AM on Tuesday mornings and the ratings met the expectations that were set for the Ultra N Project. Following the ULTRAMAN movie, Tsuburaya ran a teaser trailer for Ultraman 2 Requiem. Due to the performance of Ultraman Nexus, the film was canceled, and Tsuburaya moved ahead with a theatrical version of the then- current television series, Ultraman Mebius.  Story  Taking place four years after the events of Ultraman: The Next (2008, the series progresses into 2009 prior to the finale), Nexus focuses on the viewpoint of Kazuki Komon, the rookie of Night Raider in the fight against Space Beast threats. During the mission, Komon comes in contact with the titular Ultraman and the relationship he established with the latter's hosts. In the first half of the series, Nexus bonds with Jun Himeya, a former cameraman who's traumatized by his inability to save a girl from his past. Despite Komon's good relationship with Himeya, TLT views him as a threat regardless of Ultraman's constant attempts in rescuing them. The reveal of Komon's girlfriend, Riko Saida as Dark Faust and her immediate sacrifice nearly sent him into despair until Himeya and Nagi managed to bring him to his senses. Sometime later, former Night Raider member Shinya Mizorogi returned as he was revealed to be Dark Mephisto and attempted to persuade his former lover Nagi to his side. After exhausting himself from killing Golgolem, Himeya was captured by TLT, who proceed to dissect him in hopes of learning the secret of Ultraman's power. His brief death allows him to escape the facility but the Illustrator warned him that another transformation would result in his death. Not long after, Mizorogi utilized the help of Space Beast Kutuura to capture Nexus and imprison him in the Land of the Dead by using his former comrade Sakuta as a hostage. The Night Raider pursue the same dimension, only to discover the deceased Ultraman tied and his energies absorbed for Mizorogi to harvest it. As a result of Himeya's renewed courage, Nexus was partially revived during the fight while the Night Raiders used the last bit of Ultimate Vanisher in replenishing his energy. The battle between two giants resulted in a massive explosion that seemingly claimed their lives. Himeya confronts Komon for the last time to convey his message; the light shall be passed to someone else. Starting on episode 26, the light of Nexus was inherited by Ren Senjyu, the child of Prometheus Project who runs from the facility and started his life as a worker in the carnival. Despite his near inhuman feat, Ren has a very short life expectancy and wished to spend his final days surrounded by smiles. In the same way as his predecessor Himeya, Ren becomes fast friends with Komon and develops a relationship with Mizuo, a Memory Police who was sent to spy on him. Shinya Mizorogi was revealed to have survived his battle with Nexus and quickly captured by TLT to investigate his abilities as Dark Mephisto. While attempting to escape, Memory Police officer Hiroyuki Misawa was revealed to be the next victim and becomes Dark Mephisto Zwei, intending to replace Mizorogi. During his fight with Nexus, Mizorogi managed to becomes Mephisto once more and rescue his former adversary by claiming his own life in the process. With his dying breath, Mizorogi reveals that the Night Raiders had a traitor within their rank. As stronger Space Beasts keep emerging one after another, Ren's body took a huge toll with his life running short. The fight against Ezmael was his last as Ren survived due to the Raphael drug's intervention but the light of Nexus left him for another candidate. In the final episode, Nagi was chosen as the new holder of light. Mizorogi's words came true as the Unknown Hand, the perpetrator behind all Space Beast attacks reveals himself among the Night Raider members as he assaulted them and gloats of how the past events were all for the sake of having Nagi inherit Nexus' light and revive himself. By tricking Nagi into transforming, the Unknown absorbed her into Lethe as he resurrected in the form of Dark Zagi to attack the city. Komon managed to save Nagi from the darkness as his actions allow him to inherit the light. Transforming into Nexus, Komon used up the forms of his predecessors and their memories until encouragement by the public allows him to evolve into Nexus' long lost form; Ultraman Noa. With his full power, the silver giant expels Zagi to space and put an end to his doppelganger. A year later, the Space Beast threat has become public knowledge, and TLT has expended their forces even further.

Biography According to Houbraken, he was the son of a respected surgeon at Gorcum. Dirk Rafelsz Kamphuysen Biography in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature His mother was a mennonite whose father Hans van Mazeik was beheaded for his beliefs.Hans van Mazeik is not listed as one of the Martyrs of Gorkum His mother died when young Dirk was eight, and his father followed her soon after into the grave. Camphuysen manifested great artistic talent. His older brother, who took over his father's surgical business, sent young Dirk to learn drawing from the painter Dirck Govertsz, who later also taught his son Govert and his son's contemporary Hendrik Verschuring.Dirk Rafaelsz Camphuysen in the Netherlands Institute for Art History (RKD) He practised art quite successfully until the age of eighteen, whereupon he started to study languages. Houbraken saw some of his paintings and drawings and said he did well at landscapes with farmsheds and animals. Houbraken also mentions maneschyn or moonlight scenes. At Leiden, Camphuysen was recommended as a tutor to the 'Heer van Langerak', so deserted the pursuit of art, to become a private tutor and secretary in Nieuwpoort (Netherlands), where he studied theology in his free time. After substituting a few times for pastor Taurinus in the Domkerk in Utrecht (city), he was appointed minister of Vleuten by his boss, 'Heer van Langerak'. He married and was relatively successful as a minister, but he had embraced the doctrines of Arminianism, and like other Arminians or Remonstrants, he was banned from ministry and teaching and driven into exile (1619). Another painter-minister Lambert Jacobsz told him to leave the ministry and take up safer pursuits. He apparently took up poetry rather than painting, since so few of his paintings survive today. Houbraken claimed to have taken his information from Life of Dirk Rafelsz. Kamphuizen, a pamphlet that was published four times; first in Rotterdam, by Barent Bos, 1683, then in Amsterdam, by Jan Rieuwertsz, 1699 (this is the version Houbraken read); third in Amsterdam, by Marten Schagen, 1723, and lastly in Amsterdam, by Petrus Conradi, 1775. The close of his life was spent at Dokkum. His nephew Raphael (born 1597) is by some considered to have been the author of several of the works ascribed to him, and his son Govaert (1624–1674), a follower or imitator of Paul Potter, is similarly credited. Houbraken was surprised that Camphuysen let his son learn painting, since his biography seemed to be a treatise against the pursuit of arts. Family treeWorks Camphuysen left a translation of the Psalms, and a number of short pieces of poetry. He was also author of several theological works, among which is a Compendium Doctrinae Sociniorum. His pictures are mostly small. According to the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition, the best of his works are his sunset and moonlight scenes and his views of the Rhine and other rivers.

The film was actually produced and completed in 2002. It also features cameo appearances by Dangerfield's real-life friends, Ron Jeremy and Michael Bolton, as well as Louie Anderson. Plot Dangerfield plays Jake Puloski, a comedic and friendly warden who runs a privately owned prison for white-collar criminals and less serious offenders. Trouble starts when Puloski's plans for renovating his rundown prison are ruined by his superior, Eli Rockwood (Randy Quaid), a greedy businessman who inherited the prison from his deceased parents, who rejects his budget request. Rockwood also informs Puloski that his contract will not be renewed, which means that Puloski will be forced to retire in two months. At the same time, Rockwood is in the midst of selling his company to the very wealthy Gloria Beaumont (Kirstie Alley). Without the funds for a proper remodeling, Puloski decides to allow a group of prisoners, Mile-Away (Phil LaMarr), Next-Week (Paul Rodriguez), Jerk-Off (Marty Belafsky), and Ears (Joe Nipote), to leave the prison to burgle a sporting goods store owned by Rockwood (on the condition that they are \\"back by midnight\\" before the guard Smitty (Tony Cox) makes his rounds). The plan meets many surprises however, complicating Jake's plan, including excitable store clerk Lance (Kevin West) and a sadistic security guard (Gilbert Gottfried) with his vicious guard dog named Princess. As Jake distracts Smitty, the four prisoners break into the store, distract the store's guard dog Princess with the prison's guard dog whom they had fed viagra to earlier that night, and make off with their stolen gym equipment, but on the way back to the prison one of their truck tires goes flat. As Ears and Jerk-Off look for a tire jack in a farm house, Next-Week and Mile-Away try to fast-talk their way past Sheriff Jack Hubbard (Harland Williams), who it turns out is an old school chum of Mile-Away. Jerk-Off finds love with the farmer's sheep, alerting farmer Baxter (Blake Clark), who comes out with a shotgun, sending Jerk-Off and Ears running away with no tire jack. As Sheriff Jack Hubbard and Mile-Away reminisce, Next-Week changes the truck tire with the tire jack Sheriff Hubbard loaned them. After picking up Ears and Jerk-Off from the side of the road, the four head back to the prison. The next morning, the store security guard discovers that all the equipment has been stolen, and his beloved dog Princess was \\"a slut\\". Sheriff Hubbard inspects the crime scene, promising Rockwood that he will catch the culprits. The security guard informs them that one of the security cameras was still operational and they may have footage of the culprits; however it has only footage of the two guard dogs. At the prison, the convicts are ecstatic with their new equipment and Jake feels very proud of himself. The burglars tell Jake that they think they should get the other items the prison needs by robbing the other stores owned by Rockwood in the area, justifying it because Rockwood had been fiddling with their budget in the first place. Jake agrees to the plan since he has only two months left of his contract. As Jake distracts Smitty at the strip clubs, Ears, Jerk-Off, Mile-Away, and Next-Week rob Rockwood's other stores of their cash to pay for the renovations to the prison. Rockwood meets with Mrs. Beaumont to discuss their merger, while Mrs. Beaumont's pet monkey makes quick work of destroying Rockwood's office. Jake throws a Valentine's dance at the prison, inviting the wives and girlfriends of the convicts, where Next-Week introduces his girlfriend (Lisa Arturo) and her friend Veronica (Yeardley Smith) to his cousin Carlos (Jsu Garcia). Veronica figures out that the convicts stole money from Rockwood to afford all the changes to the prison and Carlos has to kiss her to keep her quiet. Inside the dance, a riot breaks out due to another inmate stealing Jerk-Off's inflatable date, resulting in a scuffle, and a fistfight between the inmates. At the police station, Sheriff Hubbard discovers that a shoe left by Jerk-Off at the farm belongs to a prisoner uniform at Rockwood's prison. He visits Mile-Away and after a scene of interrogation Sheriff Hubbard leaves. Mile-Away warns Jake and tells him to spread the word that there will be no more burglary jobs. Rockwood, however, has other plans. Along with Sheriff Hubbard, he creates a trap for the burglars in the form of a big weekend sale. The convicts read about it and decide to pull one last job to have some cash for themselves once they re- enter society. But Carlos demands to be a part of the job because he had to kiss Veronica to keep her quiet, leaving Jerk-Off out. At the store, Ears drills into the safe but Next-Week mistakenly leaves his cousin Carlos to roam. Carlos breaks into jewelry cases trying to take them but trips the alarm. Upon opening the safe, they find it is empty, then run outside and are caught by Sheriff Hubbard and the rest of the police department. Mile-Away escapes in the van to warn Jake. Mile-Away admits that they pulled one last job and Jake admits that Rockwood was firing him. Jerk-Off and Mile-Away enter the sheriff's department disguised as guards and manage to free Ears, Carlos, and Next-Week, escaping in the prison van, and entering a high-speed chase with Mile-Away riding with Sheriff Hubbard chasing the other burglars. Jake shows up at Rockwood's house trying to confess to the masterminding the burglaries but Sheriff Hubbard calls Rockwood from the road, hot on the burglars' trail. Rockwood decides to chase down the burglars himself. Rockwood grabs a gun and has Jake ride with him, who are joined by Mrs. Beaumont, who has an odd attraction to criminals and high speed chases. The chase ends at the prison where Ears, Jerk-Off, Next-Week, and Carlos zoom through the gate pretending to be prison laundry returning. Rockwood follows them in and notices the changes to the prison and realizes Jake masterminded the robberies. Rockwood says he will turn Jake in until Mrs. Beaumont comes into the prison and tells Rockwood how much she loves how well he treats the prisoners. Mrs. Beaumont says after seeing how he runs his prisons she definitely wants to merge her company with his and have Jake oversee all the prisons. Jake agrees and tells his gang that they need to stop the robberies permanently. A year later Jake narrates, saying he retired and finally took the fishing trip he and Smitty had always talked about. Carlos and Next-Week were released first and were greeted by their women Veronica and Next-Week's girlfriend. Ears was released and led a decent life until he cheated on a game show using his super hearing and won a million dollars. Jerk-Off was married to his inflatable girlfriend and started a family; they had an inflatable baby boy. Mile-Away became Sheriff Hubbard's deputy and they became a great crime fighting duo.

One of Dadrian's major researches is the volume titled The History of the Armenian Genocide which had seven printings and appeared in numerous languages. In this book Dadrian described the background, initiation and unfolding of the genocide, and placed it within a conceptual framework of genocide theory.Fifty Key Thinkers on the Holocaust and Genocide, by Paul Robert Bartrop, Steven L. Jacobs, Taylor & Francis, 15.11.2010, p. 82 Roger W. Smith praised it as a \\"rare work, over 20 years in the making, that is at once fascinating to read, comprehensive in scope, and unsurpassed in the documentation of the events it describes.\\" According to William Schabas, the president of the International Association of Genocide Scholars, \\"Dadrian's historical research on the Armenian Genocide is informed by a rich grasp of the legal issues\\", and \\"his contribution both to historical and legal scholarship is enormous.\\"No Stopping Now: Dadrian Celebrates 85th Birthday, Armenian Weekly, 2011 Dadrian's latest project was the translation of the Turkish Courts-Martial of 1919-20 from Ottoman Turkish to English. According to David Bruce MacDonald, Dadrian is a \\"towering figure in the field of Armenian genocide history\\".Identity Politics in the Age of Genocide: The Holocaust and Historical Representation. David Bruce MacDonald, Routledge, 2008, p. 127 Taner Akcam writes that by employing Justin McCarthy's own method of calculating population figures and classifying individuals, Vahakn Dadrian has shown the ridiculousness of the claim that \\"the events of 1915 were in fact a civil war between the Armenians and Turks\\".The Young Turks' Crime Against Humanity: The Armenian Genocide and Ethnic Cleansing in the Ottoman Empire. Taner Akçam, Princeton University Press, 2012, p. 166 German Swiss scholar Hans-Lukas Kieser writes that the documents related to fifteen Turkish ministers published by V. Dadrian show best the ministers' conception of their responsibility in the \\"abuses\\" committed against Ottoman Armenians.Turkey Beyond Nationalism: Towards Post-Nationalist Identities, Hans-Lukas Kieser, 2006, p. 113 Criticism One of the main critics of Dadrian is Guenter Lewy, who is criticized for the denial of Armenian Genocide by many scholars.MacDonald, David B. Identity Politics in the Age of Genocide: The Holocaust and Historical Representation. London: Routledge, 2008, p. 139. . In a response to critics equating Lewy's position on the Armenian genocide \\"with that of the Holocaust-denier David Irving\\", he accuses Dadrian of being \\"guilty of willful mistranslations, selective quotations, and other serious violations of scholarly ethics.\\" In his book, Lewy mentions, among others, Dadrian's defense of the authenticity of the book published by Mevlanzade Rifat, and of the \\"Ten Commandments\\", Dadrian's allegations against Turkish sociologist Ziya Gökalp, the use of Jean Naslian's Memoirs praising of Turkish court-martial of 1919–1920, and misleading references to writings of Esref Kuscubasi Bey and German General Felix Guse.Guenter Lewy, The Armenian Massacres in Ottoman Turkey, Salt Lake City: University of Utah Press, 2005, pp. 43-89, 93-94, 280, 282. Malcolm E. Yapp, of London University, describes in a book review that Dadrian's approach was \\"not that of an historian trying to find out what happened and why but that of a lawyer assembling the case for the prosecution in an adversarial system\\".Macolm E. Yapp, \\"Review of The History of the Armenian Genocide, by V. N. Dadrian\\", Middle Eastern Studies, 32 (1996), p. 397 Mary Schaeffer Conroy, professor of Russian history at Colorado University, Denver, and Hilmar Kaiser criticize Dadrian's tone, and failure to use Turkish archival sources.

In a book review Another kind of critique is based on the absence of reference, in Dadrian's publication, to the Russian policy vis-à-vis the Armenians during the First World War. Sean McMeekin argued that \\"it is far more distortion of the truth to tell the story of the Armenian tragedy of 1915 without reference (or with only passing reference) to Russia. It is akin to writing about, say, 'the bloodbath in Budapest' during the ill-fated Hungarian Revolution of 1956 without reference to the Soviet Union.\\" Sean McMeekin, The Russian Origins of the First World War, Cambridge (Massachusetts)-London: Harvard University Press, 2011, pp. 142 and 272-273, n. 3.

Dick. It was first published in 1980 in Omni magazine and subsequently in the 1985 short story collection I Hope I Shall Arrive Soon. The story was also included on We Can Remember It For You Wholesale, volume five of the Collected Short Stories of Philip K. Dick in 2003. The story is about Agneta Rautavaara, a young Finnish technician, who dies in an accident while working on a space vessel with two other technicians. However, a rescue team from Proxima Centauri gets there in time to save Rautavaara's brain and impose artificial life support on it. In her damaged brain, Rautavaara goes through a series of experiences that draw on the conceptions of afterlife held by herself on the one hand and the Proxima Centauri natives on the other. A theme of the story is whether it is ethically right to keep a human on life-support if they exist only as a mind, with their body paralyzed or otherwise destroyed.

He credits his entrepreneurial drive to the business successes of his father and grandfather, and says the catalyst for him starting his own business was being fired from his first job in investment banking for being \\"a prima donna\\".Fildes, Nic. \\"The very latest in furnishing for couch potatoes\\", \\"The Times\\", London, 11 April 2011. Hoberman has stated that he believes what makes a business successful is passion; in an interview with BBC 'The Bottom Line', he states his belief that the most successful small businesses are those where the founders remain passionate about their business, and are themselves part of their target market. He believes that by building a business to offer a solution to a problem you have yourself – as he did with lastminute.com and mydeco.com – founders stand a greater chance of remaining passionate and being successful.

Life Caricature of Mirabeau. Known as Barrel Mirabeau (Mirabeau-Tonneau) because of his \\"rotundity\\" and voluminous taste for drink, he was sent to the army in Malta in 1776, and spent part of his two years there in prison for insulting a religious procession. He served as a colonel, commanding the Touraine Regiment under the comte de Rochambeau in the American Revolution. During the war, he was in several sea-fights with the English and witnessed the Battle of Yorktown in 1781. In the following year, he had two narrow escapes from drowning. With his debts paid up by his father, he was elected by the noblesse of Limoges a deputy to the States General. Unlike his brother, he opposed the French Revolution. He was a violent conservative and opposed everything that threatened the old régime. and in 1790 left France to join the royalist counter-revolutionary forces in Germany. He was not very successful in his efforts to form a regiment from French exiles and deserters, and died of a stroke in Freiburg two years later. To Mirabeau is attributed a statement otherwise associated with Voltaire, He shared fully in the eccentric family pride; and boasted of his brother's genius even when bitterly opposing him. He emigrated about 1790 and raised a legion which was to bear his name; but his insolence alienated the German princes and his command was taken from him. He died in August 1792 of apoplexy or from a duel in Freiburg im Breisgau. He wrote some verse as well as various pamphlets.

F.\\", generally believed to be a pseudonym for Edward Fisher, a lay theologian of the seventeenth century). The work consists of religious dialogues which discuss the doctrine of the atonement and aim to guide the reader safely between Antinomianism and Neonomianism. History Thomas Boston In 1700, while making a pastoral visit in the small country parish of Simprin, in the course of his work as a Church of Scotland minister, Thomas Boston saw and borrowed a copy of The Marrow of Modern Divinity. He greatly appreciated the book and while a member of the 1717 General Assembly, commended it to a fellow minister. As a consequence of this conversation, in 1718 arrangements were made to have the Marrow reprinted, with a preface by James Hog of Carnock. The book displeased those who comprised the majority in the Church of Scotland. James Hadow, Professor of Divinity and Principal of St. Mary's College in the University of St Andrews, took the lead in opposing The Marrow, assailing it in his opening sermon at the Synod of Fife in April 1719. This was published shortly thereafter as The Record of God and Duty of Faith Therein required. An interchange of pamphlets with Hog ensued, with Hadow accusing the Marrow of the Antinomian heresy and Hog asserting that Hadow was misrepresenting the Marrow. Committee for Purity of Doctrine report At the May 1719 General Assembly, an existing \\"Committee for Purity of Doctrine\\" was instructed to \\"enquire into the publishing and spreading of Books and Pamphlets\\", tending to the spread of doctrines \\"inconsistent with our Confession of Faith\\" and to call such authors to account. The committee's report, submitted in May 1720, strongly condemned the book as Antinomian. The Assembly overwhelmingly approved this report, prohibited all ministers of the Church of Scotland from recommending The Marrow in any way, and instructed them to warn their people against reading it. This had the effect of advertising a previously obscure book to people throughout Scotland and many proceeded to buy a copy and to read it carefully. Representation and Petition At the Assembly in 1721 twelve men, including Boston, Hog and Ralph and Ebenezer Erskine, submitted a \\"Representation and Petition\\", arguing that in condemning The Marrow the Assembly had condemned propositions which were scriptural, and other expressions which were plainly taught both by many orthodox divines and in the doctrinal standards of the Church of Scotland. They also argued that the report had misrepresented the book's teaching, taking various expressions out of context. Their petition was rejected. In the Assembly of 1722 The Marrow's condemnation was reaffirmed and the twelve Representers were rebuked. Associate Presbytery Subsequently, every effort was made by the men who had opposed The Marrow to prevent ministers holding Marrow doctrines from obtaining more influential pastoral charges, but no effective disciplinary action was taken against them. The ecclesiastical controversy thus gradually drew to an end, but theological disagreement continued. In the 1730s, though over a different issue, that of patronage, some of the proponents of Marrow theology left the Church of Scotland to form the Associate Presbytery, with the distinctive doctrines of The Marrow forming the theological basis for the new church. In 1726 a new edition of The Marrow was published, with a preface and extensive annotations by Thomas Boston, defending and expounding the Marrow's teaching as Scriptural. In this form The Marrow has been frequently reprinted over the last nearly 300 years and has been widely influential. References * C. A.

Miniter's book alleged that Obama was indecisive and delayed when action was needed on the attack of bin Laden, which brought Bergen to state \\"Miniter's account of the intelligence that led to bin Laden and the decision- making surrounding the operation that killed him is a pile of poppycock served up with heaps of hogwash\\". Responding to this, Miniter wrote to CNN saying that reporters rely too heavily on White House officials and Pakistani government officials, and marginalize those who were actually present during the hours and days after the operation, hence standing behind his account detailed in his latest book. Publishers Weekly debuted Miniter's work as #13 on Week's Best Sellers in late August and discussed how Miniter's book received major press from publication through the election, appearance on Sean Hannity's television show and The Drudge Report, in addition to national television appearances, national radio shows, and so on. =Eyes On Target= Center Street, published Eyes on Target: Inside Stories from the Brotherhood of the U.S. Navy SEALs in February, 2014.

It has its southern terminus at Cairo Junction (about north of Cairo) at the intersection of U.S. Route 51 (US 51) and Illinois Route 37 (IL 37), and its northern terminus in Grafton at IL 100\\\\. Route description The majority of IL 3 has four lanes from Waterloo to Godfrey, with a brief six-lane stretch from the entrance to the McKinley Bridge in Venice to near the River's Edge area (formerly the Army Depot of Granite City) and around Alton, and a brief two-laned section between its separation from I-55, I-64, and US 40 in East St. Louis and Venice. It is also two-laned the majority of the southern part from Waterloo to Mound City around the Shawnee National Forest Area. It briefly overlaps IL 111 at Alton, I-255 and US 50, and IL 127 north of Cache. IL 3 parallels the Mississippi River for the entire length of its journey, and it carries the Illinois portion of the Great River Road for most of its length. South of St. Louis, I-55 is its parallel on the west side of the river, along with US 61\\\\. The road runs along many historical sites along the Mississippi River, and is the closest Illinois state highway to the old state capital of Kaskaskia. History=Original 1918 route= The original IL 3 route went from Chester in southern Illinois to Morrison in northwest Illinois via Rock Island. With the completion of highway bridges over the Mississippi River (e.g. Clark Bridge at Alton) U.S. Route 67 (US 67) was extended from St. Louis to Godfrey and replaced the original IL 3 to Rock Island. Today, this route is still the major north–south corridor for western Illinois—and the only major Illinois north–south route never upgraded to the Interstate Highway System like I-57, I-55, or I-39. =Current route= On August 4, 1976, the new Berm Highway from Wood River to Alton was opened. It was signed as IL 3, which left the old alignment on Lewis and Clark Boulevard and Broadway unmarked. However, on June 29, 1987, the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) built the new Madison Avenue extension in Wood River and marked that road and the Berm Highway as IL 143 and truncated IL 3 at IL 143 (highway signage and IDOT planning maps suggested otherwise, however). This new terminus for Route 3 was short-lived, however. On November 26, 1987, a new section of Homer M. Adams Parkway in Alton opened to traffic, and IL 3 was extended onto Lewis and Clark Boulevard (a former IL 3 alignment) back into Alton and onto the extension. IL 3 was then cosigned with IL 111 until the intersection with Godfrey Road, where IL 3 takes over the former IL 100 alignment.

He worked in France and London and his commissions for Colonial powers, mostly neo-classical sculpture, reliefs, and equestrian monuments in bronze and marble are found around the world. He also made some coloured marble statues. Life Carlo Marochetti was born in Turin, where his father, Vincenzo, was a priest and professor at Turin University, but after the family moved to France, he was brought up in Paris as a French citizen. He studied at the Lycée Napoléon and then studied sculpture at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris where his teachers were François Joseph Bosio and Antoine-Jean Gros. There his statue of A Young Girl playing with a Dog won a medal in 1829, and his Fallen Angel was exhibited in 1831. Between 1822 and 1830 he studied chiefly in Rome where his mother had settled. While in Rome he collaborated with François- Joseph Duret and Antoine Étex and worked briefly at the studio of Bertel Thorvaldsen. He adopted the neo-classical Romantic school of sculpture. From 1832 to 1848 he lived in Paris, France. He married Camille de Maussion in 1835 and they would have two sons and a daughter. While in Paris, Marochetti took up commissions for a relief panel of the Battle of Jemappes for the Arc de Triomphe and the Elevation of Mary Magdalene for the altar of the Church of La Madeleine. He rapidly gained fame after this and made several equestrian statues including those of Emanuele Filiberto of Savoy in Turin and of Ferdinand, Duke of Orleans. Marochetti followed the French king Louis-Philippe into exile in the United Kingdom after the fall of the July monarchy in 1848. Busts of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert Marochetti spent the greater part of his time from then until his death in London. He lived in Onslow Square, and maintained a large studio and his own foundry, nearby in Sydney Mews. Among his chief works were statues of Queen Victoria, Colin Campbell, 1st Baron Clyde (erected 1867 in Waterloo Place), and King Richard the Lionheart. The Richard Coeur de Lion (statue) was displayed in the Great Exhibition, and a bronze copy was made in 1860 to be displayed in front of the Palace of Westminster on the orders of Prince Albert. His major commissions were for equestrian monuments and mourning seraphim. Equestrian statues include those of Viscount Combermere in Chester and Sir Mark Cubbon in Bangalore. Monuments with mourning seraphim include those in St. Paul's Cathedral, the Scutari obelisk in Turkey, and the Cawnpore memorial in India. Marochetti's statue of Robert Stephenson, from 1871, still stands in the forecourt of Euston Station. He made a bust of William Makepeace Thackeray for Westminster Abbey. He also created the marble recumbent effigies for the tomb of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in the Royal Mausoleum at Frogmore in Windsor Great Park and the statue on the Duke of Wellington Commemorative Column outside Stratfield Saye House. From 1864 Marochetti collaborated with Sir Edwin Landseer on the four bronze lions to be placed around the base of Nelson's Column in Trafalgar Square, and cast them at his foundry. He experimented in coloured marbles following the work of John Gibson and a coloured statuette of Queen Victoria was exhibited at Bayswater studio but is now lost. As a favourite sculptor of Queen Victoria, Marochetti was commissioned to make the seated figure of Prince Albert for the Albert Memorial in Kensington Gardens. However the first version was rejected by the architect of the monument, Sir George Gilbert Scott, and Marochetti died before a satisfactory second version could be completed. He designed Queen Victoria's memorial to Princess Elizabeth and a bust of Prince Albert at Newport Minster on the Isle of Wight. Marochetti was created a baron by the King of Sardinia and was also a chevalier of the Legion of Honour. He was elected an associate of the Royal Academy 1861 and a full academician in 1866. Marochetti died, suddenly, at Passy in Paris and was buried at the Vaux-sur-Seine cemetery.

Traditionally this test was developed for the textiles industry but it has now been adopted by the printing industry as measure of lightfastness of ink colourants.Textile Fading Card example 1, Gaylord. Retrieved 2010-10-18.Textile Fading Card example 2 , Pel. Retrieved 2010-10-18. The American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists pioneered the work on these test methods and together with the ASTM D13 committee. Normally two identical dye samples are created. One is placed in the dark as the control and the other is placed in the equivalent of sunlight for a three-month period. A standard bluewool textile fading test card is also placed in the same light conditions as the sample under test. The amount of fading of the sample is then assessed by comparison to the original colour. A rating between 0 and 8 is awarded by identifying which one of the eight strips on the bluewool standard card has faded to the same extent as the sample under test.Faded Card example , Talas. Retrieved 2010-10-18.Faded Card example, PDF. Retrieved 2010-10-18. Zero denotes extremely poor colour fastness whilst a rating of eight is deemed not to have altered from the original and thus credited as being lightfast and permanent. The ultraviolet (UV) radiation in light is responsible for ink fading. As the intensity of UV radiation differs from place to place, the ink fading also depends on place. It will be more in areas with more UV radiation and vice versa. This difficulty is overcome by the bluewool testing method. Absolute values of fading will depend on light intensity. Relative values of fading, comparing the sample with the standard blue test strip, will depend less on intensity. For example, if a pigment is rated as \\"BW5\\" it can be expected to fade to the same degree as strip number 5 on a bluewool test card, for any specific light exposure. The method of comparison between the sample and a test strip enables accelerated testing to be carried out under intense artificial illumination.

When Franklin was eight, she began performing in plays at the Fresno Memorial Auditorium. She was in the concert choir at Central High School, where she was bullied. At fifteen, Franklin became motivated to leave Fresno to pursue a career in entertainment, after her aunt moved to Los Angeles. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fQpVKSBR-k She went by the name, Destiny Franklin, before her stint in Destiny's Child. https://www.instagram.com/p/BUiPwoYlgP1/ She is of African-American and Italian descent, and the oldest of nineteen children, including a younger sister named Karrie. 1999–2000: Destiny's Child In 1999, while living in Los Angeles, Franklin was hired to be an extra in the music video for Destiny's Child's \\"Bills, Bills, Bills\\". It was there that she met with group members Beyoncé Knowles, Kelly Rowland, LeToya Luckett, and LaTavia Roberson.

A day later, group member Beyoncé claimed in an interview that Franklin had missed three major promotional dates and expressed a lack of interest in continuing with the group, leaving them with no other choice but to dismiss her. In a later interview, Franklin denied Beyoncé's allegation, stating that she had suffered from dehydration and a stomach virus but was recovering as she traveled with the group to do shows in Seattle and Europe. Farrah contended that after being verbally attacked by management (Mathew), due to her not showing up because she was ill, she stormed out of the room and left the group. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFVfhfAdcOI 2001–present: Solo projects After leaving Destiny's Child, Franklin embarked on a solo career.

She uses her magical powers to prey on drug dealers in her hometown of Dayton, Ohio. Fictional character biography=Origin= Lori Zechlin is a teenager who lives with her father John and her mother. Neither Lori nor her father is aware that Mrs. Zechlin is addicted to prescription pharmaceuticals, which she purchases from local drug dealers. One day, overwhelmed by shame, Mrs. Zechlin commits suicide by overdosing and drowning herself in her pool. Lori discovers the body when she comes home from school. Lori also discovers, later that same night, that she has the mystical ability to \\"borrow\\" the magical powers of other superheroes or supervillains. She does not have the same control over the powers as their owners and has little control over when she can take them or how long she can use them. Despite this, Lori (taking the name Black Alice) formulates a plan to avenge her mother's death and punish the prescription drug traffickers. Lori's father, shattered and slipping into depression, becomes a recluse, although he tries to pretend for Lori's sake that nothing is wrong. Her mother's death also distresses Lori, but she is aware of the change in her father and assigns herself the role of caregiver. Her grades begin to slip, and she becomes alienated from her peers. Her primary social group, a Wiccan circle, expels her, claiming she is emitting \\"black energy\\" after her mother's death (in actuality, the circle's leader, Lori's best friend Dawn, is jealous of Lori's real and growing powers). Having recently left Gotham City following the destruction of their clock tower headquarters, the superhero team the Birds of Prey are traveling the country by jet in order to identify and help previously unknown metahumans. Oracle becomes aware of Lori's power, but not her specific abilities. She sends Huntress, disguised as a school teacher, to keep an eye on Lori and offer counseling, while Black Canary is tasked with keeping surveillance on all of Lori's activities, to determine the specific nature and strength of her powers. Lori abruptly leaves her boyfriend, Kyle, when she manifests Doctor Fate's powers, and seeks out a trio of suspected drug dealers. Before Lori can use lethal force, Black Canary intervenes. Doctor Fate's power fades, and Lori flees the scene, tailed by Black Canary. Suddenly manifesting Zatanna's powers, Lori binds and gags Canary and escapes. Black Canary and Huntress unite to tail Kyle in the hopes of rediscovering Lori, and instead find that Kyle is two-timing Lori with Dawn. Lori discovers the same thing shortly afterwards and prepares to destroy a shopping mall (having now manifested the powers of Black Adam) in her efforts to avenge herself on Kyle. Black Canary is able to bring her down in an all-out brawl, but the Huntress brings a stop to Lori's rampage by presenting a contrite Dawn. Oracle turns Lori over to the care of the real Doctor Fate, where she can receive guidance in the use of her powers. =Day of Vengeance= Black Alice makes her second appearance in the Day of Vengeance miniseries. The Shadowpact asks for her aid in confronting the Spectre and Eclipso. Over her father’s objections, she goes with the team. Despite her efforts, she does little more than delay the Spectre. Alice does manage to temporarily take the Spectre's powers. Since he is hostless, all this does is make the Spectre an intangible phantom, immune to harm. After witnessing both the death of the wizard Shazam and the destruction of the Rock of Eternity at the hands of the Spectre, she declines an offer to join the Shadowpact, choosing to return to her father and her hometown. Later, in the Villains United: Infinite Crisis Special, she helps combat the global prison break that Alexander Luthor, Jr. orchestrates. =The Society= Lori is approached by Talia al Ghul, Felix Faust, and Cheetah. They attempt to get her to join the Society, offering both training and the resurrection of her mother. The Birds of Prey attempt to intervene. A frustrated and enraged Black Alice (who almost hangs Black Canary to death using Wonder Woman's golden lasso) teleports everyone to the outskirts of Dayton and states that she just wishes to be left alone. She returns home with her parents, her mother apparently fully resurrected, but living in a constant-shock state (she barely speaks, mechanically doing house chores). Lori's life continues downhill, with her father turning alcoholic again due to his wife's condition, and popular boys and girls continuing to bully her at school. She summons the traveling helmet of Doctor Fate in an attempt to tame its powers. When the helmet starts to punish everyone who wrongs her, even her loved ones, Lori realizes that she does not need more power to attain happiness and sets the helmet free, spending more time to help rehabilitate her father. Her realization, however is short lived, as her difficult life finally takes a toll on her sanity. When Oracle summons her to help the Birds of Prey again, Black Alice apparently forgives the Birds and agrees. However, she soon snaps when Oracle reveals that her mood swings are a side effect of the antidepressants she has been taking to restrain herself, and that Lori has mirrored her mother's own addiction.Birds of Prey vol. 1 #115–116 (April–May 2008) Her addiction to antidepressants saves her when she is kidnapped by Darkseid's henchmen and taken to the \\"Dark Side Club.\\" Dosed with will- suppressing drugs and pitted against other teenaged metahumans, she discovers that her own drugs interfere with Darkseid's. Finding Misfit similarly trapped, but almost completely brainwashed and vulnerable, she briefly contemplates the idea of stealing her teleport abilities to flee alone. After discovering in Darkseid's files that she may be a blood relative of Misfit, she has a change of heart, and helps the girl escape. She leaves behind a letter, explaining her discoveries, but claiming that her feud with the young teleporter is not over.Birds of Prey vol. 1 #118 (July 2008) A few weeks later, with a new scholastic year beginning, Lori brings her rivalry to a new level. Transferring to Platinum Heights High School, she learns that Misfit is also a student, forced to attend by Oracle. While Misfit has a difficult time adapting, Lori's \\"exotic\\" lifestyle, perceived as rebellious and independent, gains the instant acceptance and adoration of the school's Silicon Valley elite.Birds of Prey vol. 1 #121 (October 2008) Various comics, including Birds of Prey and Day of Vengeance, say Black Alice is potentially the most powerful (and dangerous) teenager on the planet.Birds of Prey vol. 1 #97 (October 2006) =Reign in Hell= In the Reign In Hell storyline, Black Alice is referred to by Phantom Stranger as both \\"a novice\\" and \\"the Black Alice abomination\\". While in Hell, she seemingly teams up with Danny Khalifa, the latest incarnation of Ibis the Invincible, only to immediately betray him, apparently revealing herself to be loyal to Neron in the war for control of Hell. In actuality, she is there to find the one who stole a portion of her powers, retrieve the missing fragment, and bring vengeance down on whomever did it. She incurs the wrath of Lobo when she steals part of his strength to reach Hell's ruler. After Lori's unsuccessful attempt at stealing Satanus' power allows Blaze to gain sole control of Hell, she is returned to Earth, emotionally scarred by whatever she saw within the mind of Satanus. =Secret Six and Blackest Night= Black Alice resurfaces again by following Deadshot and Catman who had been hired to capture a child molester and bring him to the father of one of his victims. Alice confronts both Catman and Deadshot asking how much they pay. Following that she fights several policemen, as a trial of sorts, easily besting by stealing the powers of various magic users. She is accepted once she reveals that her dad is sick and that she needs money. Catman is troubled by the fact that Alice is not disturbed at the stuff they did and how easily she tends to violence.Secret Six vol. 3 #16 (February 2010) On Alice's first official mission (taking place during the events of \\"Blackest Night\\"), the team is hired to free a drug kingpin from Belle Reve. Despite being enraged at the idea of helping a drug dealer, Alice participates in the attack on the prison, using the powers of Giganta to distract the guards while her teammates sneak in. It is revealed that the entire mission is a setup staged by the Suicide Squad in order to arrest the Six. Alice steals the powers of Suicide Squad member Nightshade and defeats both her and Count Vertigo. As Alice revels in her victory, a group of Black Lanterns attack her and the other Sixers. Her fear of them inhibits her control over her stolen powers until Bane's threat forces her to teleport the Six, Rick Flag, and Bronze Tiger to the House of Secrets. Unfortunately, she brings the Black Lanterns with them and she refuses to return the power to Nightshade so she can teleport Amanda Waller to a place where she can find help. Waller knocks her out, and Nightshade takes her away only to return shortly with a Manhunter android containing the Green Lantern energy they need to destroy the Black Lanterns. Alice remains with the Six while the Squad leaves. Some time later, Alice goes with Deadshot, Scandal, and Rag Doll to try to help Catman retrieve his kidnapped, and possibly murdered, infant son. However, all the four find are a trail of corpses Catman has left behind, the sight of which brings Alice to tears. Using Dr. Occult's abilities to locate and transport the four to South Africa, Alice suddenly reacts very hostilely towards Scandal. She mistakenly believes that Scandal is after Rag Doll, whom she calls her \\"boyfriend\\" (while Rag Doll does not exactly feel the same way, he does care for Alice), despite the fact that Scandal is a lesbian. Alice summons Etrigan's abilities, turning into Estrogan, and fights Scandal. She then turns back to normal and tearfully apologizes. Alice explains that she had attempted to cure her father's asthma using Raven's healing abilities, but unsure of how to properly use them, believes she gave him cancer by mistake.Secret Six vol. 3 #21–22 (July–August 2010) In May 2010, Alice began co-starring in a back-up feature in Teen Titans alongside Zachary Zatara and Traci 13. Following this, Black Alice appears alongside fellow teen heroines Batgirl, Supergirl, Miss Martian, Lightning, Cyclone, Stargirl, Ravager, Misfit, and Terra as part of an all-female group of heroines gathered together to fight off Professor Ivo's army of robot sirens.Wonder Woman vol. 1 #600 (August 2010) =New 52= In the New 52 Alice's origin is changed. In Secret Six it is revealed that she lost her parents in a car crash that she believed she was the only survivor of. It is revealed that she actually died that day and her body is animated by the spirit of a dark elder pagan god. Secret Six (Volume 4) #10 Powers and abilities Black Alice has the ability to temporarily usurp the magical powers of any being, even ones as powerful as the Spectre, gaining all its skills and power and leaving it powerless in turn. The limit to the distance at which she can steal power of a target being is unknown, but potentially limitless as she borrows Alan Scott's abilities during the prison breakouts while he is in space. She also stole the powers of Dark Orko in the Masters of the Universe vs Justice League crossover, an impressive accomplishment as Orko was in an entirely different dimension at the time. When she steals a being's power, her clothing partially transforms to somewhat resemble that of her target. In Birds of Prey #118, she apparently steals some of Etrigan the Demon's magic, including the compulsion to speak in rhyme. She has even shown the ability to steal the powers of two beings simultaneously. In the Helmet of Fate miniseries, she takes the powers of two heroes of her choice while in school and exudes magical abilities of her own, possibly indicating a growing level of control over her powers. During the Reign in Hell storyline, she loses much of this power, and at the end, is left a shriveled, addled wreck of the sorceress she used to be, traumatized by her experience in Hell, though later stories do not show her significantly reduced. She has taken the powers of the following: *Orko *Doctor Fate *Zatanna *A member of the Marvel Family *SpectreDay of Vengeance #5 (October 2005) *Wonder Girl or Wonder Woman *Felix Faust *John Constantine *Misfit *Raven *Giganta *Alan Scott *Etrigan the Demon *Phantom Stranger *Blue Devil *Johnny Thunderbolt *Jeannette *NightshadeSecret Six vol. 3 #18 (April 2010) In Secret Six, she threatened to use the powers of the Spectre at the League of Shadows headquarters against Lady Shiva. Other versions=DC Super Friends= In DC Super Friends #19 \\"Head of the Class\\", Black Alice is a member of a class of aspiring teenage supervillains taught by Headmaster Mind. Here, her power is to duplicate the magical powers of others instead of stealing them. In a battle with the Super Friends, she is able to duplicate Wonder Woman's powers and capture them with a copy of the Magic Lasso. After Mindgrabber Kid decides to do the right thing, Black Alice decides to do so as well, and the two help the Super Friends defeat and capture the other villains. As thanks, the Super Friends decide not to arrest the two. Black Alice says she'll go back to regular school and become a hero when she grows up.

These people include, but are not limited to, Ashanti Alston, Kuwasi Balagoon, Lorenzo Kom'boa Ervin, Greg Jackson and Martin Sostre. Critics of the term suggest that it broadly eclipses important political differences between these multi-varied thinkers and incorrectly presents them as having a shared theory or movement. Ultimately, Black anarchism is a term that many of these individuals do not, or did not, all accept. Regardless, the individuals to whom the label has been applied all oppose the existence of the state, the subjugation and domination of Black people and other ethnic groups and favor a non-hierarchical organization of society. In general, these individuals argue for class struggle while stressing the importance of ending racial and national oppression, opposing capitalism, patriarchy, the state and white supremacy. They have generally rejected narrow or explicit forms of anarchism that ignore issues of race and national oppression, a deformed \\"white, petty-bourgeois Anarchism that cannot relate to the people\\" and that refuses to deal with issues of race by saying \\"No, don't talk about racism unless it is in that very abstract sense of we-are-all-equal-let's-sing-kumbayas-and-pretend-the- color-of-our-skin-does-not-matter\\" anti-racism.Riberiro, Pedro Ribeiro. \\"Reflections on APOC and the fate of Black Anarchism\\".

So, when I speak of a Black anarchism, it is not so tied to the color of my skin but who I am as a person, as someone who can resist, who can see differently when I am stuck, and thus live differently.\\"Alston, Ashanti. \\"Black Anarchism\\". Anarchist Panther. . As an anarchist, Alston added that he viewed Black nationalism as progressive yet also as deeply limited, stating that \\"Panther anarchism is ready, willing and able to challenge old nationalist and revolutionary notions that have been accepted as 'common- sense.' It also challenges the bullshit in our lives and in the so-called movement that holds us back from building a genuine movement based on the enjoyment of life, diversity, practical self-determination and multi-faceted resistance to the Babylonian Pigocracy. This Pigocracy is in our 'heads,' our relationships as well as in the institutions that have a vested interest in our eternal domination.\\"@narchist Panther Zine. October 1999. 1 (1). Most recently, activists and scholars have emphasized the importance of Black anarchism in the formation of histories surrounding the Black Liberation Army, Black Panther Party and other modes of the Black radical tradition beginning with slave rebellions in the European colonies of the late 18th century to the present-day. In \\"As Black As Resistance: Finding the Conditions of Liberation\\", activists William C. Anderson, Mariame Kaba and Zoé Samudzi, describe the necessity of Black anarchism in current political struggles, arguing that \\"Black Americans are residents of a settler colony, not truly citizens of the United States. Despite a constitution laden with European Enlightenment values and a document of independence declaring certain inalienable rights, Black existence was legally that of private property until postbellum emancipation. The Black American condition today is an evolved condition directly connected to this history of slavery, and that will continue to be the case as long as the United States remains as an ongoing settler project. Nothing short of a complete dismantling of the American state as it presently exists can or will disrupt this.\\"  See also  * Anarchism and nationalism * Anarchist Black Cross Network * African anarchism * Black Liberation Army * Black separatism * MOVE * Prison abolition movement * Zabalaza Anarchist Communist Front  Notes  External links  * \\"Black Anarchism\\" by Chuck Morse includes transcript of a talk by Ashanti Alston. * \\"Anarchist Panther\\". * \\"Black Anarchism.

He was one of the founders of the Négritude movement. He also used the pseudonym Lionel Georges André Cabassou.\\"Damas, Léon Gontran\\", in Donald E. Herdeck (ed), Caribbean Writers: A Bio-Bibliographical-Critical Encyclopedia, Washington, DC: Three Continents Press, 1979, p. 349. Biography Léon Damas was born in Cayenne, French Guiana, to Ernest Damas, a mulatto of European and African descent, and Bathilde Damas, a Métisse of Native American and African ancestry. In 1924, Damas was sent to Martinique to attend the Lycée Victor Schoelcher (a secondary school), where he would meet his lifelong friend and collaborator Aimé Césaire. In 1929, Damas moved to Paris to continue his studies. There, he reunited with Césaire and was introduced to Leopold Senghor. In 1935, the three young men published the first issue of the literary review L'Étudiant Noir (The Black Student), which provided the foundation for what is now known as the Négritude Movement, a literary and ideological movement of French-speaking black intellectuals that rejects the political, social and moral domination of the West. In 1937, Damas published his first volume of poetry, Pigments. He enlisted in the French Army during World War II, and later was elected to the French National Assembly (1948–51) as a deputy from Guiana. In the following years, Damas traveled and lectured widely in Africa, the United States, Latin America and the Caribbean. He also served as the contributing editor of Présence Africaine, one of the most respected journals of Black studies, and as senior adviser and UNESCO delegate for the Society of African Culture. In 1970 Damas and his Brazilian- born wife Marietta, moved to Washington, D.C., to take a summer teaching job at Georgetown University. During the last years of his life, he taught at Howard University in Washington and served as acting director of the school’s African Studies program. He died on January 22, 1978, in Washington and was buried in Guyana. Although the political aspect of his poetry held less appeal in the later years of the twentieth century, Damas’s reputation was on the rise. His poems, which sometimes experimented with typography and with the sound of words, were astonishingly modern for their time, and they seemed to anticipate the black poetry, both English and French, of a much later timeframe.

It adds two additional speakers to the more conventional six-channel (5.1) audio configuration. As with 5.1 surround sound, 7.1 surround sound positional audio uses the standard front left and right, center, and LFE (subwoofer) speaker configuration. However, whereas a 5.1 surround sound system combines both surround and rear channel effects into two channels (commonly configured in home theatre set-ups as two rear surround speakers), a 7.1 surround system splits the surround and rear channel information into four distinct channels, in which sound effects are directed to left and right surround channels, plus two rear surround channels. In a 7.1 surround sound home theatre set-up, the surround speakers are placed to the side of the listener's position and the rear speakers are placed behind the listener. In addition, with the advent of Dolby Pro Logic IIz and DTS Neo:X, 7.1 surround sound can also refer to 7.1 surround sound configurations with the addition of two front height channels positioned above the front channels or two front wide channels positioned between the front and surround channels. Label for 7.1 extended surround sound History=Home Entertainment= The Blu-ray Disc and the HD DVD home video formats provide up to eight channels of lossless DTS-HD Master Audio, Dolby TrueHD or uncompressed LPCM audio at 96/48 kHz 24/16-bit. The Sony PlayStation 3 video- game console can output up to 7.1 LPCM through HDMI for both Blu-ray movies and games. =Cinema= While some movies have been remixed to 7.1 audio tracks on Blu-ray Discs for home cinema, the first discrete theatrical 7.1 soundtrack was Toy Story 3 in 2010, followed by Step Up 3D. Disney announced that they will use 7.1 surround for their future 3D releases. Recent titles include Megamind, Tangled, Tron: Legacy, Gnomeo and Juliet, Mars Needs Moms' , Gulliver's Travels and The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. In 2011, additional movies were released with theatrical 7.1 audio, including Thor, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, Kung Fu Panda 2, Super 8, Green Lantern, Cars 2, Transformers: Dark of the Moon, Captain America: The First Avenger. All these titles are exhibited in the Dolby Surround 7.1 theatrical format. 7-1-surround-sound =Music= The history of electronic music includes the evolution of multi-channel playback in concert (arguably the real roots of \\"surround sound\\" for cinema) and for a considerable time the 8-channel format was a de facto standard. This standardisation was fostered, in great measure, by the development of professional and semi-professional 8-track tape recorders—originally analog, but later manifesting in proprietary cassette formats by Alesis and Tascam. The speaker configuration, however, is much less traditional, and unlike cinematic reproduction systems, there is no hard-and-fast \\"standard\\". In fact, composers took (and to some extent still take) considerable interest in experimenting with speaker layouts. In these experiments, the goal is not limited to creating \\"realistic\\" playback of believably natural sonic environments. Rather, the goals are often simply to experience and understand the psychoacoustics effect created by variations on source and imaging. Some of the first live concerts to appear were Chris Botti in Boston in 2009 and Satchurated in 2012.

She made her first screen appearance in the episode broadcast on 31 July 2003. Tasha departed the series on 10 October 2006. Tasha arrives in Summer Bay as a disoriented young girl who only speaks Pig Latin for several weeks. Her backstory of being raised by adoptive survivalist parents soon comes to the fore. She quickly befriends Max Sutherland (Sebastian Elmaloglou), Flynn Saunders (Joel McIlroy) and Sally Fletcher (Kate Ritchie). Tasha has a love interest in the form of Robbie Hunter (Jason Smith) and the couple later marry. Other storylines see Tasha on the hunt for her biological parents Angie Russell (Laurie Foell) and Ian Osbourne (Andrew McFarlane). She is also involved in some of the more dramatic storylines including joining a cult called The Believers, led by Mumma Rose (Linden Wilkinson) and Jonah Abraham (James Mitchell). Tasha subsequently falls pregnant and is held against her will by Mumma Rose following the child's birth. Casting Lucas joined the serial in 2003 after being discovered by talent scout Sharron Meissner, who was on holiday at the time. Meissner encouraged Lucas to audition for the part of Kit Hunter, which eventually went to Amy Mizzi. However, Series Producer Julie McGuaran created the role of Tasha specifically for Lucas. Lucas was then required to move from her home town of Melbourne to Sydney, where the serial is filmed. She told Michael Gadd of the Newcastle Herald: \\"It gets a little crazy at times, but when we have to get up at sunrise to start a shoot it hits me the most,\\" Lucas said. \\"I just walk out to see the start of the day at Palm Beach and think 'Wow, this is my office'. \\"Believe me, most of the time I don't feel like I'm working 60-hour weeks.\\" She described the role as \\"meaty\\" for someone relatively new and said it was part of the reason she enjoyed playing Tasha. Lucas described the event as \\"fate intertwined with my own self-belief\\". Storylines=Backstory= Tasha was born to Angie Russell (Laurie Foell) after a one-night stand with the wealthy Ian Osbourne (Andrew McFarlane). Ian paid Angie off and she subsequently put Tasha up for adoption by survivalist couple Mike and Jenny Andrews, who had dropped out of society. Angie put $30,000 along a letter to her daughter to be opened when she reached the age of eighteen in a box and gave it to the couple. Mike and Jenny raised Tasha in a fortress camp in the bush and prepared for Y2K. They were killed trying to protect camp with firearms, leaving Tasha traumatised, forcing her to flee. =2003–06= Tasha is spotted walking along the beach by Max Sutherland (Sebastian Elmaloglou). She is seemingly spooked by him and jumps into the sea. When Max returns the next day with Flynn Saunders (Joel McIlroy), Tasha runs off again but falls and hurts her ankle. They bring her to Flynn's surgery but Tasha does not say a word. At the hospital,Tasha tries to escape and but is immediately sedated. Flynn tries to communicate with Tasha by speaking several different languages to no avail. He soon realises she is speaking Pig latin. Tasha forms an attachment to Irene Roberts (Lynne McGranger), who is able to calm her down one day at the hospital. Tasha's stay at the Beach House is met with drama after she burns her hands in a fire when is she is nowhere near it. She is visibly scared of Kane Phillips (Sam Atwell) and through flashbacks it is revealed that Kane and his older brother, Scott (Josh Rosenthal) held her hostage during a petrol station robbery. Irene quickly works out Tasha's name and she begins learning some English. Tasha's enrollment in the local High school does not run smoothly but Kit Hunter takes her under her wing and helps her to adjust to normal society. Flynn learns that Angie is Tasha's biological mother which shocks Irene, who makes a realisation after seeing a photo of a younger Angie. Irene tries to protect Tasha but she finds out anyway. Max is shocked as Angie had caused problems between his uncle Rhys (Michael Beckley) and aunt Shelley (Paula Forrest). Tasha is hurt when she discovers Irene trying to hide the truth and runs away. Kit's brother, Robbie tries to find her by setting a trap but needs rescuing himself after he is bitten by a snake. Tasha saves him and they quickly become friends and share a kiss. Kim Hyde (Chris Hemsworth) arrives in Summer Bay and Tasha and Robbie quickly become friends with him. There is a small love triangle when Tasha kisses Kim and Robbie is hurt but they reconcile and they all remain friends. Duncan Stewart (Brendan McKensy) exposes Angie's true nature in a videotape Seb Miller (Mitch Firth) made a year earlier. Tasha has dream in which Angie appears and heads to the bush to unearth the money she had hidden and finds some guns in the process. Duncan blackmails Tasha into paying him off in exchange for her father's identity, which she does. Tasha uses the remainder of the money to buy friends presents but they kindly turn her down. After some more tension with Irene, Tasha goes looking for her father, Ian Osbourne. Ian sets Tasha some tests and gives her a choice; join him in the city or remain in Summer Bay. She chooses the latter. Tasha meets her half-brother Dylan (Brett Hicks-Maitland) and Angie's cousin, Josie (also played by Foell). She builds up a relationship with Josie, much to Irene's chagrin. During this time Tasha and Robbie consummate their relationship. Things are strained when Robbie has a HIV scare after stepping on a needle during a camping trip and behaves erratically, pushing Kim and Tasha away. She is also disappointed in Josie when she jilts Jesse McGregor (Ben Unwin) at the altar after cheating on him with Marc Edwards (Christopher Hobbs). Tasha joins a cult named the believers much to worry of her friends who warn her, but she refuses to listen. The cult's leader, Mumma Rose (Linden Wilkinson) decides Tasha will be the chosen one and carry her son Jonah Abraham's (James Mitchell) baby. She is later drugged and falls pregnant (Jonah is later revealed to be sterile). Tasha struggles to love the baby at first but after the child is kidnapped by Mumma Rose, she changes her mind. Following Robbie's trial for the murder of his grandfather, Graham Walters) (Doug Scroope) and a guilty verdict (albeit with no jail time), Josie invites the couple and baby Ella to join her in Boston and they leave. Reception For her portrayal of Tasha, Lucas won the Most Popular New Female Talent accolade at the 2004 Logie Awards. Brian Courtis of the Sunday Age referred to Tasha as a \\"Blonde Princess\\" ahead of her wedding to Robbie. In an interview with The Sunday Times, Catholic Priest Toby Sherring spoke out against the storyline where Mumma Rose convinces Tasha to join the Believers. He said: \\"Sometimes it is assumed that all churches operate like cults, who will steal away naive teenagers from their families, brainwash them with strange ideas and involve them in strange suicide pacts, or send them knocking on people's doors with predictions about the end of the world.\\" He added: \\"Because religion in TV shows such as Home and Away is portrayed in this way, the media version is firstly more believable and secondly much more intriguing, although ultimately unappealing.\\" References Category:Home and Away characters Category:Fictional adoptees Category:Television characters introduced in 2003 Category:Female characters in television ","title":"Tasha Andrews"},{"id":"2287777","text":"Nanak Singh, (b. July 4, 1897 as Hans Raj - December 28, 1971), was an Indian poet, songwriter, and novelist of the Punjabi language. His literary works in support of India's independence movement led the British to arrest him. He published novels that won him literary acclaim. Early life Nanak Singh was born to a poor Punjabi Hindu family in the Jhelum district of Pakistan as 'Hans Raj'. He later changed his name to Nanak Singh after adopting Sikhism. Although he did not receive a formal education, he started writing at an early age by writing verses on historical events. Later, Singh started to write devotional songs, encouraging Sikhs to join the Gurdwara Reform Movement. In 1918, he published his first book Satguru Mehma, which contained hymns in praise of the Sikh Gurus. It is considered his first commercially successful literary work. Indian Independence movement On April 13, 1919 British troops shot and killed 379 peaceful rally participants in what became known as the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre on Baisakhi (Punjabi New Year) day in Amritsar. Singh was present with two friends who were killed in the massacre. This incident impelled Singh to write Khomeini Visayans – Bloody Baisakhi (Punjabi New Year), an epic poem that mocked colonial rule. The British Government became concerned about his provocative publication and banned the book. Singh participated in India’s independence struggle by joining the Akali movement. He became the editor of Akali papers. This was noticed by the British Government. Singh was charged with participation in unlawful political activities and was sent to Borstal Jail, Lahore. He described the savagery and oppression of the British on peaceful Sikhs during the Guru ka Bagh Mocha demonstration in his second poetry collection, Zakhmi Dil. It was published in January 1923, and was banned within two weeks of publication. Singh wrote several novels during his time in jail, including over 40,000 pages in longhand Gurmukhi (Punjabi) script. He was publicly recognized with many awards, including Punjab's highest literary award in 1960. His great historical novel, Ik Mian Do Talwaran (One Sheath and Two Swords, 1959), won him India’s highest literary honor, the Sahitya Akademi Award, in 1962. Prolific writer In 1945 he wrote his popular novel , which won him acclaim. It was translated into Hindi and other Indian languages, and into English by his grandson Navdeep Singh Suri. In 1968 the book was adapted into the successful motion picture, (Pavitra Paapi), by his admirer Balraj Sahani. Quoting the Tribune, \\"Nanak Singh was the best selling novelist in India for thirty to forty years. He wrote over 50 books including novels and collection of short stories. He made significant contributions to various literary genres. For him character was the determination of incident and incident the illustration of character. His greatest contribution to Punjabi fiction is its secularization. He depicted excerpts from contemporary life, cloaked with a veil of romantic idealism.\\" In his novel Chitta Lahu (White Blood), Singh writes, \\"It seems to imply that in the lifeblood of our society, red corpuscles have disappeared.\\" In 2011, Singh's grandson, Dilraj Singh Suri, translated Chitta Lahu into English (titled White Blood). Natasha Tolstoy, the granddaughter of novelist Leo Tolstoy, translated Singh's novel Chitta Lahu into Russian. She visited Nanak Singh in Amritsar to present to him the first copy of the translated novel.

Stalls for animals can often be found wherever animals are kept: a horse stable is often a purpose-built and permanent structure. A farmer's barn may be subdivided into animal stalls or pens for cows and other livestock. Horse care In horse care, the standard dimensions for a \\"loose box\\" (UK) or \\"box stall\\" (US) vary from to , depending on local cultural traditions, the breed of horse, gender, and any special needs. Mares with foals often are kept in double stalls. Stallions, kept alone with less access to turnout, are also often given larger quarters. Ponies sometimes are kept in smaller box stalls, sometimes as small as , and warmbloods or draft horses may need larger ones. Box stalls usually contain a layer of absorbent bedding such as straw or wood shavings and need to be cleaned daily. Prior to the late 20th century, the tie stall or standing stall was a more common housing for working horses that were taken out daily.

It was originally published in the October/November 1997 issue of The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction. In 2000, it was included in the game Stephen King's F13, and in 2002, in King's collection of the same name. Plot summary Richard \\"Dinky\\" Earnshaw, a 19-year-old high school dropout, explains that he's got a good job in which he gets his own house, car, and virtually anything he asks for -- including CDs that have not been released yet. He also gets a small weekly cash allowance, provided he doesn't look for the people who drop it through his mail slot and that he gets rid of any money left over at the end of the week; he dumps his excess change into the gutter by his house and he puts his bills in the garbage disposal. It is revealed that Dinky has the ability to mentally influence people by drawing complicated designs or pictures, in a way that he does not completely understand. This is illustrated when he recalls that, as a child, when a dog tormented him on his way home from school, he (semi-knowingly) drove it to suicide. At Dinky's previous job at a convenience store, he was forced to endure humiliating treatment by another employee named Skipper, until the day Dinky used his power to make Skipper kill himself. Dinky is discovered by a man named Mr. Sharpton, who claims to work for an organization that searches across the world for people with such talents. Dinky is recruited to kill very specific targets by e-mailing them his designs that he creates on an Apple computer. He is, in return, given a life that seems ideal, complete with a house and other benefits. Mr. Sharpton tells Dinky that the people he is ordered to kill are wicked, horrible criminals, and that the world is better off without them. For a time, Dinky lives his new life in a semi-mindless bliss; however, when he finds an article in the newspaper about one of the individuals whom he has killed (a seemingly innocent old newspaper columnist) he begins to feel guilty for what he has done. After researching more into his other victims, Dinky realizes that the organization has been using him to assassinate political dissidents and alternative thinkers. As the story ends, Dinky plans his escape, but not before sending one final email to Mr. Sharpton, his recruiter, with a nondescript symbol attached. Inspiration King states in the foreword for this short story that the idea came from a dream about a person pouring change into the storm drain. According to Stephen Spignesi, a recognized authority on the subject, Stephen King told Peter Straub that the character of Dinky is a \\"Breaker\\", like Ted in the novella Low Men in Yellow Coats, thereby connecting this tale to the world of The Dark Tower, The Stand and other King Dark Tower works.

His revolvers were used during the Crimean War, the Indian Mutiny, the U.S. Civil War, and the Anglo- Zulu War. Career=Dean and Adams= Adams Revolver, made by Durussel in Morges circa 1860. On display at Morges military museum Adams cal .36 revolver Adams was the manager for the London arms manufacturers George & John Deane. On August 22, 1851, he was granted a British patent for a new revolver design. The .436 Deane and Adams was a five-shot percussion (cap-and-ball) revolver with a spurless hammer, and the first revolver with a solid frame. The revolver used a double-action only system in which the external hammer could not be cocked by thumbing it back, like most other pistols of the era, but instead cocked itself when the trigger was pulled. This made it possible to fire the gun much more rapidly than contemporary single-action revolvers, such as the Colt, which had to be cocked before each shot. Deane and Adams' revolver was shown at the Great Exhibition of 1851 and subsequently approved by the British Army's Small Arms Committee in addition to being adopted by the East India Company for use by their cavalry. Orders for the revolver were great enough to prompt the Deane brothers to make Adams a partner in their firm, which became Messrs. Deane, Adams, and Deane. Although highly regarded, the hand-crafted Adams revolver was more expensive than Colt's mass-produced guns. It lacked a recoil shield behind the cylinder, which left the shooter's hand subject to powder burns resulting from \\"blowback\\" caused by the sometimes unpredictable black powder of the era. The lack of a hammer spur was criticized since the longer trigger pull of the Adams made it less accurate than the Colt. Furthermore, the Adams' nipples, upon which the percussion caps were set, were unhardened and sometimes burst upon firing. An \\"Improved Frame\\" model was offered in 1854, presenting both a sleeker look and more comfortable grip. In that same year the British Board of Ordnance reviewed the Adams together with other percussion revolvers with a view to adopting one as an official service sidearm. Concerns about the gas escape between the cylinder and barrel during discharge resulted in no decision being made. Nevertheless, British officers purchased the Adams privately and the gun proved its worth in battle during the Crimean War. =Beaumont–Adams= In 1855 a veteran of the Crimean conflict, Lieutenant Frederick E.B. Beaumont, improved the gun by linking the trigger to a spurred hammer, permitting both single- and double- action fire. A new version of the revolver, the Beaumont–Adams, was produced and became so popular that it is said Samuel Colt was forced to shut down his London manufactory as a result. An Improved Frame Model of 1854 A Beaumont–Adams =London Armoury Company= Adams had a falling out with the Deane brothers the following year and founded a new arms concern, the London Armoury Company, on February 9, 1856. Another important stockholder was Adams' cousin, James Kerr, who later invented the Kerrs Patent Revolver. The factory was established on the former site of the South-Eastern Railway Company in the Bermondsey section of London. The Indian Mutiny of 1857 established the Adams as the official revolver of the British Army. In the bitter fighting it was found that rapid fire was more important than accuracy, and the man-stopping power of the Adams' large caliber bullet was also valued. Last Adams percussion, Model of 1866 British Army Mark III, Model of 1872 Several variations and improvements were made upon the Adams, which was manufactured in Europe and briefly in the United States under license. The majority of British-made Adams guns seem to have been in 54 bore (approximately .44 caliber), but several smaller and at least one larger bore were also offered. In 1857 the U.S. government purchased 100 revolvers in .36 caliber and another 500 from the Adams-licensed Massachusetts Arms Company. The 100 British-made guns were issued to the U.S. Army with the rest held in storage until issued at the outbreak of the U.S. Civil War. In addition Adams revolvers were purchased from the London Armoury prior to and during the war by individual states and the U.S. and Confederate governments. The London Armoury Company flourished due to the manufacture of the Adams revolver, however, in 1859 the company's board of directors decided to increase the production of infantry rifles, decreasing revolver production. Adams disagreed with the decision, selling his stock and leaving the company. Kerr then became the armoury's dominant figure and his revolver, together with a large number of rifles, were sold to the Confederate government which became the armoury's principal client. With the fall of the Confederacy the fortunes of the company declined and it went into receivership in 1866. Adams owned the rights to his revolver, which the London Armoury Company had only produced under license, and he now manufactured them in Birmingham, with minor improvements keeping his revolvers in competition with other designs. =John Adams= In 1867, Robert Adams' brother John Adams patented a breech-loading revolver which was adopted by the British government in place of the Beaumont–Adams. It was a solid frame pistol with six chambers, in .450 caliber. After official acceptance of his pistol, Adams left the London Armoury Company and established his own factory, the Adams Patent Small Arms Company. His pistol was manufactured in three distinct variations (differences related mainly to methods of spent cartridge ejection) between 1867 and about 1880. The models were tested and adopted by the British Army and Navy, with the last, the M1872 Mark III, seeing the widest use. The John Adams revolver remained the official sidearm of the British Army until replaced by the Enfield Mark I in 1880.

History  In 1948, the library at Fairfield University under the leadership of Librarian Robert Gaffney, boasted over 5,000 books and the panoramic view of all panoramic views of the Long Island Sound from the windows of Berchmans Hall. With a new Librarian, Robert Barrows, it moved in 1949 to two rooms in Xavier Hall. Father Francis A. Small was named Director of Libraries in 1952, a position he would hold for over two decades of great change. Father Small led the move in 1957 to Canisius Hall, where the library remained for a decade. During this move, the science library was to stay in Xavier Hall. It was under the leadership of Father Small that the library began a microform collection, purchased its first electronic typewriter, and developed a procedure for duplication catalog cards. Groundbreaking for a library building took place in 1967, with the building opening the following year. The new building was planned with an estimated 20 years worth of space to grow. With the opening of the new building in 1968, the library increased its capacity from 90,000 books to 300,000 books. It featured a smoking area, two typing rooms, and its first full-time reference librarian. In 1971, the library was named Nyselius Library in honor of benefactors Gustav and Dagmar Nyselius. They were Swedish immigrants who had settled in Stamford and wanted to make a donation to Fairfield University to repay in part the kindness of their adoptive country. At the time of donation their gift was the largest ever given to Fairfield University. In 1973, the library joined OCLC, an online cataloging service that provided access to a database as well as printed catalog cards. In 1974, Barbara Bryan, then Associate Director, was named University Librarian. The library added a media department in 1980, thanks to a grant from the Gladys Brooks Foundation. In 1982 it joined the Bibliomation consortium, which introduced barcodes and wands to replace handwritten sign out slips for checking out books. The library's first computer lab opened in 1986, offering access to 8 Apple computers. Steady technological improvements continued to augment the library-a CD-ROM reference center in 1990 thanks to the Gladys Brooks Foundation; a CD-ROM LAN in 1991 thanks to grants from the E.L. Cord Foundation and the George I. Alden Trust; an online public access catalog in 1993; and a computer lab with 25 workstations in 1997. In 1996, James Estrada became the University Librarian and took the lead on the library expansion and renovation project. After long and careful planning, July 1999 marked the groundbreaking ceremonies for the library expansion, an undertaking supported largely by a gift from alum Joseph A. DiMenna, Jr. '80. The project neared completion as classes started in the fall semester of 2001, under the leadership of Estrada and Director of Library Services Joan Overfield. In the fall of 2001, the DiMenna–Nyselius Library opened.

It was consolidated in the Taihō Code of 702. The Asuka Kiyomihara Code of 689 marks the initial appearance of this central administrative body composed of the three ministers—the Daijō-daijin (Chancellor), the Sadaijin (Minister of the Left) and the Udaijin (Minister of the Right).Hall, John Whitney et al.. (1993). The Cambridge History of Japan, p. 232. The Imperial governing structure was headed by the Daijō-kan. This council and its subsidiary ministries handled all secular administrative affairs of the country, while the Jingi-kan or Department of Worship, oversaw all matters regarding Shintō ritual, clergy, and shrines. This structured organization gradually lost power over the course of the 10th and 11th centuries, as the Fujiwara clan, dominating the post of Imperial regent, began to dominate the Daijō-kan as well. It became increasingly common for the regent to hold the post of chancellor or other office simultaneously. By the 12th century, the council was essentially powerless as a separate entity, though it seems clear that the system was never formally dismantled. Over the course of centuries, the ritsuryō state produced more and more information which was carefully archived; however, with the passage of time in the Heian period, ritsuryō institutions evolved into a political and cultural system without feedback.Mesheryakov, Alexander (2003). \\"On the Quantity of Written Data Produced by the Ritsuryō State\\" , Japan Review, 15:187–199. By the time of the Emperor Kōmei, the kuge aristocracy were joined in common goals by a number of newly powerful provincial figures from outside Kyoto. Together, this tenuous, undefined coalition of men worked together to restore the long latent prestige, persuasive power, and active strengths of a re-invigorated Imperial center. This combination of factors thrust an archaic hierarchy into the center of national attention, but with so many other high-priority matters demanding immediate attention, there was little time or energy to invest in reforming or re-organizing the Daijō-kan. Ritsuryō organization and hierarchy The eighth century ritsuryō innovations would prove to be remarkably durable and resilient across the span of centuries.Ritsuryō -- court structure and offices, Sheffield. Any exercise of meaningful powers of court officials reached its nadir during the years of the Tokugawa shogunate, and yet the Daijō-kan did manage to persist intact through the initial years of the Meiji Restoration.Ozaki, Yukio. (2001). The Autobiography of Ozaki Yukio: The Struggle for Constitutional Government in Japan pp. 10-11. It is not possible to assess or evaluate any individual office without assessing its role in the context of a durable yet flexible network and hierarchy of functionaries.Dickson, Walter G. et al. (1898). ; excerpt at p. 56, \\"Klaproth has given in his \\"Annals of the Emperors\\" a sketch of these eight boards, with the offices under each. It is ... a concise account of the government of Japan. The study of such a subject is rather dry and uninteresting, but it is necessary for any one who wishes to make himself acquainted with Japanese history, either of the past or of the present day....\\" In the early Meiji period, the appointed Imperial Daijo-kan was filled with princes, aristocrats, loyalists domain lords (daimyō), and samurai.Ozaki, pp. 1-6. Within months after Emperor Meiji's Charter Oath, the ancient ritsuryō structure was slightly modified with an express focus on the separation of legislative, administrative, and judicial functions within the Daijō-kan system.Ozaki, p. 10. The evolution of a deliberative body within a modern constitutional system was gradual, and its constituent differences from the old Daijō-kan were not entirely self-evident at first, as revealed in an Imperial message in 1869: :\\"The Assembly shall be for the wide ranging consultation of public opinion and, respecting the Imperial will which laid the foundations of national government, it will be a place where the energies of the multitude are harnessed. Thus, it is necessary that proceedings will show respect for the Imperial rescript, be united in purpose with the Daijō-kan, take the fundamentals of government to heart, judiciously address matters which arise, and act to ensure that unity within the country is not compromised.\\"Ozaki, p. 11. Some months later, another major reform of the Daijō-kan re-united the legislative and executive functions which had been clearly separated earlier. In 1871, The office of Daijō-daijin in the Great Council of State was briefly resurrected under the Meiji Constitution with the appointment of Sanjō Sanetomi. Despite the similarity of names for its constituent offices, this Daijō-kan would have been unrecognizable to Fujiwara courtiers of the Heian period. Nor would it have seemed at all familiar to those men who surrounded the emperor in the days of the Kenmu Restoration. In due course, it was decided that a modern integrated cabinet system would better serve a modern Japan. The Daijō-kan system, which had been divided into ministerial committees, would be replaced by a more modern model. In December 1885, the old system was abolished completely;Ozaki, p. 86. and yet, even afterwards, some elements of old system were adapted to new uses. For example, in that year, the title of Naidaijin was reconfigured to mean the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal of Japan in the Imperial Court.Dus, Peter. (1988). The Cambridge History of Japan: The Twentieth Century, pp. 59, 81. The man who had previously held the office of prime minister or chief minister of the initial restoration government was the Daijō-daijin, Sanjō Sanetomi. Sanjō petitioned the emperor to be relieved of his ancient ritsuryō office; and he was then immediately appointed Naidaijin, or Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal. The office of the Privy Seal was identical with the old Naidaijin only in its Japanese title—not in terms of function or powers.Unterstein (in German): Ranks in Ancient and Meiji Japan (in English and French), pp. 6, 27. Council of State This dry catalog does provide a superficial glimpse inside the complexity of what was initially designed as a pre-feudal court structure. What this list cannot easily explain is how or why the Daijō-kan turned out to be both flexible and useful across a span of centuries: * Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). See also, .Varley, H. Paul. (1980).

Ritsuryō Eight Ministries The Asuka-, Nara- and Heian-period Imperial court hierarchy encompassed a multi-faceted bureaucracy focused on serving the needs of the Emperor, the Imperial family, the Imperial Household and the Imperial state.Ministry of Emperor's Household, Sheffield. Imperial power and prestige would wax and wane during the subsequent Kamakura-, Kenmu-, Muromachi-, Nanboku-chō-, Sengoku-, Azuchi–Momoyama-, and Edo-periods; nevertheless, the basic structure of the Imperial household remained largely unchanged.

The origins of the current can be traced back to structures which were put into effect during the reign of Emperor Monmu,History of Imperial Household Agency with some subsequent modifications. In 1702, the Taika era name for the palace organization, kunai _-kan_ or \\"government\\" of the palace, was changed to the kunai _-shō_ or \\"ministry\\" of the palace. Accompanying this modification, the chief administrative official was afterwards called kunai-kyō. After the Meiji Restoration, the kunai-shō name remained unchanged. There were two other periods of modification and in 1889.\\"Ministry of the Imperial Household\\", Catholic Encyclopedia.

Tokugawa courtiers Even nominal administrative powers of court officials reached a nadir during the years of the Tokugawa shogunate. In this impoverished period, titles and court rank were still prized by those outside the traditional kuge. The Tokugawa shōguns did not demur when the Emperor offered rank and an office in the court: * Tokugawa Ieyasu had the rank of Jūichii (First Rank, Second Class) and the office of Udaijin (Great Minister of the Right, i.e., inferior to the Minister of the Left)Screech, T.

After serving at the Battle of Austerlitz on 2 December 1805, he was promoted to General of Brigade. He earned further distinction in Germany and Poland as a dashing leader of horse, and in 1808 he was sent into Spain. Here occurred an incident which unfavourably influenced his whole career. He found himself obliged to overstay his leave of absence in order to protect the lady who afterwards became his wife. Napoleon was furious, and deprived him of his command, and Montbrun was awaiting his master's decision when an opportunity came to retrieve his reputation. Some doubt exists as to the events of the famous cavalry charge at the Battle of Somosierra, but Montbrun's share in it was most conspicuous. Soon afterwards he was promoted to General of division, and in 1809 his light cavalry division took no inconsiderable part in the victories of Eckmühl and Raab. He was employed in the Peninsular War, during 1810–1811. At the battles of Bussaco and Fuentes de Onoro, he commanded Marshal Andre Masséna's cavalry reserve. He was killed while commanding the II Cavalry Corps (Grande Armée) at the beginning of the Battle of Borodino (7 September 1812). Montbrun was considered, as a leader of heavy cavalry, second only to Kellermann of all the generals of the First Empire. Shot by a cannonball from side to side, he whispered \\"excellent shot !\\", before losing consciousness. References * Bowden, S. & Tarbox, C. Armies on the Danube 1809.

Early life Breckinridge was born in Paris, France to Adelaide Murphy and John Cabell Breckinridge Sr. (1879–1914), a wealthy Californian family. He was the great- great-great-grandchild of U.S. Attorney General John Breckinridge (and the great-grandchild of both U.S. Vice President and Confederate general John C. Breckinridge and Wells Fargo Bank founder Lloyd Tevis). He spent time at Eton College and Oxford University in England. Career=Plan 9 from Outer Space= Bunny Breckinridge in Plan 9 from Outer Space In 1958, Breckinridge agreed to play the role of an alien leader in the film Graverobbers from Outer Space (later retitled Plan 9 from Outer Space), directed by his friend, Ed Wood. Wood and Breckinridge were introduced to one another by their mutual friend Paul Marco, who played Kelton the Cop in three Wood films. Breckinridge and Marco were living together in the latter's modest home at the time, despite the fact that he was a struggling B-movie actor and Breckinridge was an independently wealthy socialite. David Demering, who played the airplane co-pilot in the film, also lived with them. Breckinridge's previous stage experience convinced Wood to cast him as the alien ruler who oversees an attempt to take over the Earth using an army of reanimated corpses. Indeed, his background made him one of the few truly experienced actors in the entire cast. Dressed in a pajama-like outfit which is curiously less ornate than those worn by his underlings, he sports very visible mascara and lipstick, and constantly rolls his eyes and mugs for the camera. =Later years= Breckinridge continued his theatrical career throughout the 1950s, but in small local productions, such as playing the role of The Inquisitor in Richard Bailey's production of The Lark in Carmel. By 1980, Plan 9 from Outer Space had amassed a cult following among B-movie buffs as the \\"worst film ever made\\", making Breckinridge's name known to a new generation. Meanwhile, he returned to stage acting, appearing mostly in local productions in San Francisco. In 1994, Breckinridge was surprised to find himself portrayed as a character in a major motion picture, played by Bill Murray in Tim Burton's 1994 biopic Ed Wood. His advanced years and failing health, however, prevented him from participating in any of the publicity surrounding the film. Personal life In 1927, while working as a drag/burlesque entertainer in Paris, he married Roselle du Val de Dampierre (1903-1999), the daughter of Robert Henri du Val de Dampierre, a French Count, and Marie du Val de Dampierre (née Serailler). They divorced two years later, but had one daughter: *Solange Breckinridge, who married Comte Lionel de Bruchard. She later married Prasad. Breckinridge maintained homes on each coast – one in New Jersey and one in San Francisco. He died on November 5, 1996 at age 93, in a nursing home in Monterey, California. He was quoted in his obituary as saying, \\"I was a little bit wild when I was young, darling, but I lived my life grandly.\\" =Sexuality= Openly gay at a time when it was daring (and even dangerous) to be so, he was well known for his flamboyant lifestyle, his outrageous sense of humor, and his penchant for perfume and costume jewelry. He performed in Shakespearean plays in England before moving to San Francisco in the late 1920s. He also frequently performed in drag. In 1955, he was arrested in a San Francisco waterfront bar and charged with vagrancy and jailed, though the charges were later dropped because of his family and wealth. In 1959, shortly after Plan 9 From Outer Spaces disappointing release, Breckinridge was convicted on ten counts of \\"sex perversion\\" for taking two underage boys on an excursion to Las Vegas. He was committed to the Atascadero State Hospital for the criminally insane, and released the following year. Upon his release, he returned to his San Francisco home, a Spanish-style bungalow adorned with gold framed photographs of the many celebrities he met and befriended, including Princess Margaret, Noël Coward, J. Edgar Hoover, Elvis Presley, and Ed Sullivan. Breckinridge frequently opened his home to members of the growing hippie movement, who were enthralled not only by his stories of his flamboyant youth, but also his favorable opinions on free love and his encyclopedic knowledge of both gay history and the lives of closeted Hollywood stars. =Gender identity= In the 1940s, male-to-female sex change operations were becoming more widely available in Europe, and Breckinridge expressed many times his desire to undergo the procedure. With the nationwide attention given to Christine Jorgensen's sex change in 1952, Breckinridge became more determined than ever to begin transitioning. In 1954, he announced plans to travel to Denmark and undergo the operation so he could marry his male secretary. Though Breckinridge was by this time a grandparent, his granddaughter supported him in his efforts. Shortly thereafter, a San Francisco judge scuttled his Denmark trip by ordering him into court for failing to make good on an earlier agreement to pay $8,500 a year to support his elderly, blind mother in England. He then made arrangements with a sex- change surgeon in Mexico, but had a serious car accident while traveling there. He gave up his pursuit of the matter afterwards.

Born in Darlington, County Durham, Bewick was the son of an upholsterer. He went to London to train under the painter Benjamin Haydon at the age of 20. Bewick executed a large cartoon of some of the figures in the Elgin Marbles at the request of the German poet Goethe. He also worked as a copyist, so successfully that Sir Thomas Lawrence sent him to copy Michelangelo's frescoes of the Sistine Chapel in Rome in 1826. Upon his return three years later, he worked as a historical and portrait painter. Forced to retire by illness, Bewick spent his last 20 years in north-east England. Bewick's Life and Letters were published by Thomas Landseer, the brother of the famous painter, in 1871. They form a source for Haydon's circle, and include a character study of William Hazlitt, whom Bewick knew well. They include a description of the poet Foscolo reciting his poetry in the presence of Wordsworth.

The route passes through or close to the towns of Portsmouth, Waverly, Chillicothe, Grove City, and Columbus. From Waverly to Chillicothe, it overlaps US 23\\\\. SR 104 is an original state highway with two parts: One from Portsmouth to Waverly, and one from Chillicothe to Columbus. The southern part of the route was decertified when U.S. Route 23 was certified in 1926. This southern route was replaced with the now defunct route number State Route 112. In 1951, the southern part of the route was recertified as State Route 104, connecting to the northern part of the route by overlapping U.S. Route 23. The route close to Portsmouth was concurrent with State Route 73. Since 1968 the northern terminus has been extended twice – to U.S. Route 23 in 1968 and to U.S. Route 33 via freeway in 1989 – and its southern terminus has been extended twice into Portsmouth in 1972 and to U.S. Route 23 in 1974. In 1998, a section of SR 104, concurrent with SR 73, in Scioto County had its grade raised out of the flood plain to prevent recurring flooding on the roadway in a $3.8 million project. In 2010, a section of SR 104 north of Chillicothe to SR 207 in Ross County was widened into a four-lane highway. $6.5 million out of the $10.6 million cost to widen were from funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.

Geography  Saxonville is located at 42.3203 degrees N latitude, 71.4404 degrees W longitude. Large areas of Saxonville are situated on hilly terrain that rises up steeply in places from the Sudbury River, a small river that winds through the village. In a description of the area for the proposed Saxonville Historic/Nature Walk, Stephen Herring (Framingham Town Historian), writes: \\"...The area from the Concord Street Bridge to Central Street is surrounded on three sides by the Sudbury River, giving it the early name of Otter Neck. Framingham's first settler, John Stone, built his home at Otter Neck in 1647. We do not know the exact site of the homestead. Native Americans of the Nipmuc tribe had a village and fort here before the arrival of European settlers. For almost two hundred years this part of Framingham was known as Stone's End due to the dominance of the Stone family. It became Saxonville when the textile industry was established here, one of the early companies being named the Saxon Factory Company...\\" In addition to the village's name, a road in the northern end is named Saxony Road. Though the name Saxonville has been thought to have come directly from Europe, Saxonville was named after a land development company, the Saxon or Saxony land development company.  History  Native Americans lived and fished in the area of the Sudbury falls for centuries up through the 18th century. In the 1970s, arrowheads were found when portions of the river were drained to conduct maintenance on the dam and water control system around the falls. In all likelihood Saxonville sprung up due to the Sudbury River's drop in elevation in the region and the free power represented by the falls. The first industry in Framingham was a grist mill that John Stone erected at the falls on the river, granted by Act of the Great and General Court of Massachusetts. In May 1656, Edmund Rice and Peter Noyes surveyed of land purchased by John Stone of Sudbury from the Indians that was supplemented by a grant of the General Court to Stone of an additional at the Sudbury River falls.p. 404, In: Shurtleff, Nathaniel Bradstreet (ed.), (1854), Records of the Governor and Company of the Massachusetts Bay in New England, Vol. 3, 1644-1657. Press of William White, Boston. The mill rights were held by the Stone family for 165 years when it was sold to the Saxonville Mills. Around 1865 a dam was built across the river to control and exploit for power. The remnants of the dam's power control gates and gears can still be seen near the falls at Central Street, near the intersection of Central and Water streets. An underground channel supplied water from above the falls to the manufacturing plant where it was used to drive water wheels or turbines to provide mechanical manufacturing power at the mill. The lower portion of the 1858 section of the mill where waste water exited the turbines and poured into the lower portion of the river is now behind flood control walls. Through the 1960s Saxonville still had its own operating dairy in a high, flat area on Danforth street about 3/4 mile east of the village center. The Twin Maple Farms dairy was located just east of Meadow Street, bounded by Danforth Street. The dairy maintained a small herd of dairy cows located in fields near Danforth Street. Until 1966, the dairy operated a fleet of delivery trucks that delivered fresh milk and dairy products to homes around area. Sometime around 1967 the dairy ceased operations. The dairy's milking machines and bottling facility were left idle and slowly deteriorated through in the early 1970s. The site is now occupied by residences. The town operated the Saxonville elementary school on the hilly portion of Elm Street, just above the village. Originally a wooden school house that held four large classrooms on two floors, it was replaced with a newer structure during the new deal era Works Progress Administration. The original structure became known as the annex. The annex building was still used into the 1960s. The building was razed in the 1970s when the town constructed a new gymnasium and cafeteria addition to the building. The school is now known as the Mary E. Stapleton school after a local school instructor and principal.

It is the largest shopping centre in Gothenburg with approximately 180 shops and 150 offices. The shopping centre's total area is about divided into nine interconnected buildings, where retail and restaurant floor space makes up around . The covered streets and squares comprise . The companies housed in Nordstan employ approximately six thousand people and the total annual turnover was SEK 4.1 billion in 2013. The main passageways in the centre are public spaces and therefore are open for use after shops have closed. The character of the centre changes after closing time of the shops. The presence of adults is drastically reduced and the premises become a hangout for youth. History The construction of Nordstan began in 1967, over a part of the city previously neglected. The area was called Östra Nordstan (Eastern North city), as it was located north of the Great Canal and east of the Östra Hamngatan street, in opposite to Västra Nordstan (Western North city) located west of that street. Östra Nordstan was shortened to Nordstan when the shopping centre was opened. Most of the current Nordstan was finished by 1972. At its time, the construction of the shopping centre was Sweden's largest ever city renovation project. In the last few years (written 2006) Nordstan has gone through a major renovation to make it more attractive. Nordstan was for some time a hangout for street children with foreign backgrounds, from the suburbs of Gothenburg and from outside Sweden, after the shops close at night. These gangs threatened shop keepers, traded drugs and fought with other gangs in the centre. Many of the unaccompanied minors hanging in the shopping centre have had several asylum applications rejected. Location and transportation Nordstan is located in Gothenburg's city centre, connected to the Gothenburg Central Station and the Nils Ericson Terminal by an underground pedestrian tunnel, and to the Lilla Bommen marina and the Gothenburg Opera house by sheltered walkways. The shopping centre also offers parking space to 2,700 cars. Just outside Nordstan are three different tram stops on three sides of the shopping center, making it easy to reach Nordstan by public transportation. A majority of the visitors use public transportation. If almost all of the visitors had used cars (as it is for many shopping centres outside city centres), around 8,000 parking places would be needed and this would need more parking space area than shop area.

Childhood and early career  Gifford was born in Greenfield, New YorkAmerican Archives of Art, Smithsonian Institution. Biographical information. and spent his childhood in Hudson, New York, the son of an iron foundry owner. He attended Brown University 1842-44, where he joined Delta Phi, before leaving to study art in New York City in 1845. He studied drawing, perspective and anatomy under the direction of the British watercolorist and drawing-master, John Rubens Smith. He also studied the human figure in anatomy classes at the Crosby Street Medical college and took drawing classes at the National Academy of Design. By 1847 he was sufficiently skilled at painting to exhibit his first landscape at the National Academy and was elected an associate in 1851, an academician in 1854. Thereafter Gifford devoted himself to landscape painting, becoming one of the finest artists of the early Hudson River School.  Gifford's travels  George Fuller, William Page, Henry Kirke Brown, Joseph A. Ames, Asher B. Durand, John Quincy Adams Ward and Sanford Robinson Gifford (seated). Like most Hudson River School artists, Gifford traveled extensively to find scenic landscapes to sketch and paint. In addition to exploring New England, upstate New York and New Jersey, Gifford made extensive trips abroad. He first traveled to Europe from 1855 to 1857, to study European art and sketch subjects for future paintings. During this trip Gifford also met and traveled extensively with Albert Bierstadt and Worthington Whittredge. In 1858, he traveled to Vermont, \\"apparently\\" with his friend and fellow painter Jerome Thompson. Details of their visit were carried in the contemporary Home Journal. Both artists submitted paintings of Mount Mansfield, Vermont's tallest peak, to the National Academy of Design's annual show in 1859. (See \\"Mt. Mansfield paintings controversy\\" below.) 'Thompson's work, Belated Party on Mansfield Mountain, is now owned by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York,' according to the report.Scandal over Mansfield by Mark Bushnell, Rutland [Vt.] Herald, January 11, 2009. Retrieved 1/13/09. Thereafter, he served in the Union Army as a corporal in the 7th Regiment of the New York Militia upon the outbreak of the Civil War. A few of his canvases belonging to New York City's Seventh Regiment and the Union League Club of New Yorkhttp://hamiltonauctiongalleries.com/Gifford-62.JPG are testament to that troubled time. During the summer of 1867, Gifford spent most of his time painting on the New Jersey coast, specifically at Sandy Hook and Long Branch, according to an auction Web site. The Mouth of the Shrewsbury River, one noted canvas from the period, is a dramatic scene depicting a series of telegraph poles extending into an atmospheric distance underneath ominous storm clouds. Another journey, this time with Jervis McEntee and his wife, took him across Europe in 1868. Leaving the McEntees behind, Gifford traveled to the Middle East, including Egypt in 1869. Then in the summer of 1870 Gifford ventured to the Rocky Mountains in the western United States, this time with Worthington Whittredge and John Frederick Kensett. At least part of the 1870 travels were as part of a Hayden Expedition, led by Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden.SRG pictured on horseback, with caption Picture 1. Archive of American Art. Smithsonian Institution.  In the studio  Lake Scene - 1861 A Gorge In The Mountains October in the Catskills Returning to his studio in New York City, Gifford painted numerous major landscapes from scenes he recorded on his travels. Gifford's method of creating a work of art was similar to other Hudson River School artists. He would first sketch rough, small works in oil paint from his sketchbook pencil drawings. Those scenes he most favored he then developed into small, finished paintings, then into larger, finished paintings.https://images.google.com/images?hl=en&q;=sanford+gifford&ie;=UTF-8&sa;=N&tab;=ni  \\"Chief pictures\\"  Gifford referred to the best of his landscapes as his \\"chief pictures\\". Many of his chief pictures are characterized by a hazy atmosphere with soft, suffuse sunlight. Gifford often painted a large body of water in the foreground or middle distance, in which the distant landscape would be gently reflected. Examples of Gifford's \\"chief pictures\\" in museum collections today include: * Lake Nemi (1856–57), Toledo Museum of Art, Toledo, Ohio * The Wilderness (1861), Toledo Museum of Art, Toledo, Ohio * A Passing Storm (1866), Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford, Connecticut * Ruins of the Parthenon (1880), Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.  Gifford's death  On August 29, 1880, Gifford died in New York City, having been diagnosed with malarial fever. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City celebrated his life that autumn with a memorial exhibition of 160 paintings. A catalog of his work published shortly after his death recorded in excess of 700 paintings during his career. Between 1955 and 1973, Gifford's heirs donated the artist's collection of letters and personal papers to the Archives of American Art, a research center which is part of the Smithsonian Institution.

The series contains some of Kipling's most well-known work, including the poems \\"Gunga Din\\", \\"Tommy\\", \\"Mandalay\\", and \\"Danny Deever\\", helping consolidate his early fame as a poet. The first poems were published in the Scots Observer in the first half of 1890, and collected in Barrack-Room Ballads and Other Verses in 1892. Kipling later returned to the theme in a group of poems collected in The Seven Seas under the same title. A third group of vernacular Army poems from the Boer War, titled \\"Service Songs\\" and published in The Five Nations (1903), can be considered part of the Ballads, as can a number of other uncollected pieces. Poems While two volumes of Kipling's poems are clearly labelled as \\"Barrack-Room Ballads\\", identifying which poems should be grouped in this way can be complex. The main collection of the Ballads was published in the 1890s, in two volumes: Barrack- Room Ballads and Other Verses (1892, the first major publishing success for Methuen) and The Seven Seas (1896), sometimes published as The Seven Seas and Further Barrack-Room Ballads. In both books, they were collected into a specific section set aside from the other poems, and can be easily identified. (Barrack-Room Ballads and Other Verses has an introductory poem (\\"To T.A.\\") in Kipling's own voice, which is strictly not part of the set but is often collected with them.) A third group of poems, published in 1903 in The Five Nations, continued the theme of military vernacular ballads; while they were titled \\"Service Songs\\", they fit well with the themes of the earlier ballads and are clearly connected. Charles Carrington produced the first comprehensive volume of the Ballads in 1973, mainly drawn from these three collections but including five additional pieces not previously collected under the title. Three of these date from the same period: an untitled vernacular poem (\\"My girl she gave me the go onst\\") taken from a short story, The Courting of Dinah Shadd, in Life's Handicap (1891); Bobs (1892 or 1898), a poem praising Lord Roberts; and The Absent-Minded Beggar (1899), a poem written to raise funds for the families of soldiers called up for the Boer War. The remaining two date from the First World War; Carrington considered Epitaphs of the War, written in a first-person style, and Gethsemane, also in a soldier's voice, to meet his definition. Both were published in The Years Between (1919). Kipling wrote profusely on military themes during the war, but often from a more detached perspective than the first-person vernacular he had previously adopted. Finally, there are some confusingly captioned pieces. Many of Kipling's short stories were introduced with a short fragment of poetry, sometimes from an existing poem and sometimes an incidental new piece. These were often identified \\"A Barrack-Room Ballad\\", though not all the poems they were taken from would otherwise be collected or classed this way. This includes pieces such as the introductory poem to My Lord the Elephant (from Many Inventions, 1899), later collected in Songs from Books but not identified as a Ballad. It is not clear if these were deliberately omitted by Carrington or if he explicitly chose not to include them. =List= ; From Barrack-Room Ballads and Other Verses * \\"Dedication: To T.A.\\" * \\"Danny Deever\\" * \\"Tommy\\" * \\"Fuzzy-Wuzzy\\" * \\"Soldier, Soldier\\" * \\"Screw-Guns\\" * \\"Cells\\" * \\"Gunga Din\\" * \\"Oonts\\" * \\"Loot\\" * \\"Snarleyow\\" * \\"The Widow at Windsor\\" * \\"Belts\\" * \\"The Young British Soldier\\" * \\"Mandalay\\" * \\"Troopin' * \\"The Widow's Party\\" * \\"Ford o' Kabul River\\" * \\"Gentlemen-Rankers\\" * \\"Route Marchin' * \\"Shillin' a Day\\" ; From The Seven Seas * \\"Back to the Army Again\\" * \\"Birds of Prey\\" March * \\"Soldier an' Sailor Too\\" * \\"Sappers\\" * \\"That Day\\" * \\"The Men That Fought at Minden\\" * \\"Cholera Camp\\" * \\"The Ladies\\" * \\"Bill 'Awkins\\" * \\"The Mother Lodge\\" * \\"Follow Me 'Ome\\" * \\"The Sergeant's Weddin' * \\"The Jacket\\" * \\"The 'Eathen\\" * \\"The Shut- Eye Sentry\\" * \\"Mary, Pity Women!\\" * \\"For to Admire\\" ; Uncollected * Bobs * \\"My girl she gave me the go onst...\\" Reception T.S. Eliot, in his essay on Kipling for his 1941 anthology of Kipling's verse,Eliot, 1963. pp. 5–36. writes that many writers have written verse without writing poetry, but that Kipling was unusual in that he did write poetry without setting out to do so.Eliot, 1963. pp. 8–9. In Eliot's view, this makes Kipling a 'ballad- writer', and that was already, he thought, more difficult in 1941 than in Kipling's time, as people no longer had the music hall to inspire them.Eliot, 1963. pp. 9–10. Eliot thought Kipling's ballads unusual, also, in that Kipling had been careful to make it possible to absorb each ballad's message on a single hearing. But, wrote Eliot, Kipling had more to offer than that: he had \\"a consummate gift of word, phrase, and rhythm\\", never repeated himself, and used short, simple stanzas and rhyming schemes.

The city developed into a financial centre, nicknamed the smallest metropolis in the world.  Early history  Frankfurt is located in what was originally a swampy portion of the Main valley, a lowland criss-crossed by channels of the river. The oldest parts are therefore to be found on the higher portions of the valley, through which passed the Roman road from Mainz (Roman Moguntiacum) to Heddernheim (Roman Nida). The Odenwald and Spessart ranges surrounded the area, lending a defensive advantage, and placenames show that the lowlands on both sides of the river were originally wooded. The oldest part of the Altstadt, the old city center, is the Cathedral Hill (Domhügel), upon an island created by arms of the Main. Only from the West could it be reached by foot without getting wet; this, together with its location at a ford, gave it significant military and economic advantages. Stray archeological finds on the Domhügel go back to the Paleolithic, but the first proven settlement and land development date to the Roman era. It is assumed that the Romans settled on the hill in the last quarter of the 1st century CE; amongst other things, a Roman bath has been found, which may have belonged to a larger complex, possibly a fortress. Apparently the military occupation was abandoned during the 2nd century and replaced by a villa. Several farm buildings have also been excavated. A similar building complex was discovered at the modern Günthersburgpark in the Frankfurt-Bornheim portion of the city. With the retreat of the Roman border to the west bank of the Rhine in 259/260, the Roman history of Frankfurt came to an end. A 19th century statue of Charlemagne in Frankfurt = Early Middle Ages = The name Frankfurt first appears in writing in the year 793, but it seems to have already been a considerable city. In 794 a letter from the Emperor to the bishop of Toledo contained \\"in loco celebri, qui dicitur Franconofurd\\", which reads \\"that famous place, which is called Frankfurt.\\" It seems Cathedral Hill was already permanently settled in Merovingian times (possibly first by Romans). In 1992 excavations at the cathedral found the rich grave of a girl, that has been dated to the late Merovingian period of the 7th century. Charlemagne built himself a royal court at \\"Franconovurd\\", the \\"ford of the Franks\\", and in the summer of 794 held a church council there, convened by the grace of God, authority of the pope, and command of Charlemagne (canon 1), and attended by the bishops of the Frankish kingdom, Italy and the province of Aquitania, and even by ecclesiastics from England. The council was summoned primarily for the condemnation of Adoptionism. According to the testimony of contemporaries two papal legates were present, Theophylact and Stephen, representing Pope Adrian I. After an allocution by Charlemagne, the bishops drew up two memorials against the Adoptionists, one containing arguments from patristic writings; the other arguments from Scripture. The first was the Libellus sacrosyllabus, written by Paulinus, Patriarch of Aquileia, in the name of the Italian bishops; the second was the Epistola Synodica, addressed to the bishops of Spain by those of the Empire, Gaul and Aquitania. In the first of its fifty-six canons the council condemned Adoptionism, and in the second repudiated the Second Council of Nicaea of 787, which, according to the faulty Latin translation of its Acts (see Caroline Books), seemed to decree that the same kind of worship should be paid to images as to the Blessed Trinity, though the Greek text clearly distinguishes between latreia and proskynesis; this constituted a condemnation of iconoclasm. The remaining fifty-four canons dealt with metropolitan jurisdiction, monastic discipline, superstition etc. Louis the Pious, Charlemagne's son, selected Frankfurt as his seat, extended the palatinate, built a larger palace, and in 838 had the city encircled by defensive walls and ditches. After the Treaty of Verdun (843), Frankfurt became to all intents and purposes the capital of East Francia and was named Principalis sedes regni orientalis (principal seat of the eastern realm). Kings and emperors frequently stayed in Frankfurt, and Imperial Diets and church councils were repeatedly held there. The establishment of religious monasteries and numerous endowments to the local church furthered the urban community. Also, as the Holy Roman Emperor had no permanent residence anymore, Frankfurt remained the center of imperial power and the principal city of Eastern Francia.  Late Middle Ages  Territory of the free imperial city in the mid 18th century After the era of lesser importance under the Salian and Saxon emperors, a single event once again brought Frankfurt to the fore: it was in the local church in 1147 that Bernard of Clairvaux called, amongst others, the Hohenstaufen king Conrad III to the Second Crusade. Before leaving for Jerusalem, Conrad selected his ten-year-old son as heir, but the boy died before his father. Due to this, an election was held in Frankfurt five years later, and after the emperor Frederick Barbarossa was elected, Frankfurt became the customary place for the election of the German kings. =Free Imperial City of Frankfurt= By 1180 the city had expanded greatly, and by 1250 had seen an increase in privileges in addition to economic growth. A free imperial city under the Hohenstaufen emperors, Frankfurt experienced strong growth and rising national importance. Responsibility for the maintenance of public order lay with the bailiffs and reeves; however, the citizens selected their own mayors and officials, who were responsible for some judicial duties. These officials enjoyed the favor of the emperors, who had eliminated the reeves entirely by the end of the Hohenstaufen dynasty. Soon, Frankfurt became a fully self-governing Imperial estate with seat and vote on the Rhineland bench of the College of towns of the Imperial Diet. On the Reichsmatrikel (Imperial tax-schedule) of 1521, Frankfurt's contribution to the defense of the Empire was assessed at 500 gulden, 140 foot soldiers and 20 horsemen, ranking fifth among the 85 free imperial cities, behind Nuremberg, Ulm, Strasburg and Lübeck.G. Benecke, Society and Politics in Germany 1500–1750, Routledge & Kegan Paul Ltd, 1974, appendix II. Frankfurt preserved its essentially medieval aspect as late as 1872  The Early Modern era, 16th to 18th centuries  Starting from the 16th century, trade and the arts flowered in Frankfurt. Science and innovation progressed, and the invention of the printing press in nearby Mainz promoted education and knowledge. From the 15th to 17th centuries, the most important book fair in Germany was held in Frankfurt, a custom which would be revived in 1949. Plundering of the Jewish quarter during the Fettmilch Rebellion In the early 17th century tensions between the guilds and the patricians, who dominated the city council, led to substantial unrest. The guilds asked for greater participation in urban and fiscal policies as well as for economic restrictions of the Jewish community's rights. In 1612, following the election of Emperor Matthias, the council rejected the Guild's request, to read out publicly the imperial privileges given to the city. This caused the so-called Fettmilch Rebellion, named after its leader, the baker Vinzenz Fettmilch. A part of the populace, mainly craftsmen, rose up against the city council. In 1614, the mob began a pogrom in the city's Jewish ghetto, and the emperor had to ask Mainz and Hessen- Darmstadt to restore order. In the Thirty Years' War, Frankfurt was able to maintain its neutrality; the city council had avoided siding with one opponent or another after its negative experiences in the Schmalkaldic War. This issue became critical between 1631 and 1635, when the Swedish regent Gustav Adolf came to Frankfurt demanding accommodation and provisions for himself and his troops. But the city mastered these adversities more easily than what was to follow the war: the plague ravaged the city, as it would most of Europe at this time. In the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, Frankfurt was confirmed as an Imperial Free City, and soon reached new heights of prosperity. The Palais Barckhaus at Zeil in Frankfurt even served as residence of Emperor Charles VII until 1744. Frankfurt in 1770, protected by its walls and bastions  From the French Revolution to the end of the Free State  During the French Revolutionary War, General Custine occupied Frankfurt in October 1792. On December 2 of the same year, the city was retaken. In January 1806, General Augereau occupied the city with 9,000 men and extorted 4 million francs from it. Frankfurt's status as a free city ended when it was granted to Karl Theodor Anton Maria von Dalberg in the same year. In 1810 Dalberg's territories were reorganized into the Grand Duchy of Frankfurt. During this time, the city experienced serious changes in the structure and construction of the town. Centuries-old defensive walls were dismantled, replaced by garden plots. It was felt that one no longer need fear cannon fire, even without walls. On July 1, 1808, Goethe's mother wrote to her son Wolfgang: \\"Die alten Wälle sind abgetragen, die alten Tore eingerissen, um die ganze Stadt ein Park.\\" (The old barriers are levelled, the old gates torn down, around the whole city a park.) On November 2, 1813, the allies drew together in Frankfurt, to re-establish its old rights and set up a central administrative council under Baron vom Stein. The Congress of Vienna clarified that Frankfurt was a Free City of the German federation, and in 1816 it became the seat of the Bundestag. This government seat occupied the Palais Thurn und Taxis. When Goethe visited his native city for the last time in 1815, he encouraged the councilmen with the words: \\"A free spirit befits a free city…..It befits Frankfurt to shine in all directions and to be active in all directions.\\" The city took good heed of this advice. When in 1831 Arthur Schopenhauer, a lecturer at the time, moved from Berlin to Frankfurt, he justified it with the lines: \\"Healthy climate, beautiful surroundings, the amenities of large cities, the Natural History Museum, better theater, opera, and concerts, more Englishman, better coffee houses, no bad water… and a better dentist.\\" In 1833 a revolutionary movement attempted to topple the Diet of the royalist German Confederation, which sat at Frankfurt, and was quickly put down. The German Revolutionary Student Movement, 1819-1833Rolland Ray Lutz, Central European History, Vol. 4, No. 3 (Sep., 1971), pp. 215-241 Rebellion of the German Revolutionary Student Movement, 1833 = The Revolutions of 1848 and their aftermath = The Revolutions of 1848, also known as the March Revolution, forced Klemens von Metternich, the reactionary Austrian head of state, to step down. This was celebrated wildly in Frankfurt. On 30 March 1848 one could see black, red, and gold flags everywhere, and the populace was admonished not to shoot into the air. On 18 May 1848, the National Assembly held its first meeting in the Frankfurter Paulskirche. The last meeting was held there a year later, on 31 May 1849. Frankfurt was at this point the center of all political life in Germany. The party transformation and the excitement were the most violent there; riots, particularly among those living in the Sachsenhausen quarter, had to be suppressed with force of arms on 7–8 July 1848 as well as on 18 September. The next fifteen years saw new industrial laws focusing on complete freedom of trade, and political Emancipation of the Jews, initiated ten years before its final realization in 1864. Starting in August 1863, a political gathering focused on German federal reform met in Frankfurt, including the national congress and the opposing reform congress. The Kingdom of Prussia did not show up, however, and the reform failed, leading to the Austro-Prussian War in 1866. Frankfurt was annexed by Prussia as a result of the war, and the city was made part of the province of Hesse-Nassau. The spire of the cathedral tower marks the geographical center of the city at exactly 50° 6' 42.5\\" North and 8° 41' 9.4\\" East.  Recent history = Early Nazi period = In 1933 the Jewish mayor (Oberbürgermeister) Ludwig Landmann was replaced by NSDAP member Friedrich Krebs. This led to the firing of all Jewish officials in the city administration and from city organizations. A meeting of Frankfurt traders, who wanted to discuss the boycott of Jewish businesses, was broken up and the participants arrested and intimidated. Although the Nazis had originally mocked the city as the Jerusalem am Main because of its high Jewish population, the city adopted a propagandistic nickname, the Stadt des deutschen Handwerks or the city of German craft. The main synagogue in Frankfurt destroyed on Kristallnacht =Kristallnacht= Commander-in-Chief of all Allied Forces, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, witnesses the corpses found at Ohrdruf forced labor camp in May 1945. Most of the synagogues in Frankfurt were destroyed by the Nazis on Kristallnacht in late 1938, deportation of the Jewish residents to their deaths in the Nazi concentration camps quickening in pace after the event. Their property and valuables were stolen by the Gestapo before deportation, and most were subjected to extreme violence and sadism during transport to the train stations for the cattle wagons which carried them east. Most later deportees (after the war began in 1939) ended up in new ghettoes established by the Nazis such as the Warsaw Ghetto and the Lodz ghetto, before their final transportation and murder in camps such as Sobibor, Belzec and Treblinka. = World War II = Model of Frankfurt's old city center after the bombing raids. Large parts of the city center were destroyed by in the bombings of the second World War. On March 22, 1944, a British attack destroyed the entire Old City, killing 1001 people. The East Port - an important shipping center for bulk goods, with its own rail connection - was also largely destroyed. Frankfurt was first reached by the Allied ground advance into Germany during late March 1945. The US 5th Infantry Division seized the Rhine-Main airport on 26 March 1945 and crossed assault forces over the river into the city on the following day. The tanks of the supporting US 6th Armored Division at the Main River bridgehead came under concentrated fire from dug-in heavy flak guns at Frankfurt. The urban battle consisted of slow clearing operations on a block-by-block basis until 29 March 1945, when Frankfurt was declared as secured, although some sporadic fighting continued until 4 April 1945. = Post-war period= The Military Governor for the United States Zone (1945–1949) and the United States High Commissioner for Germany (HICOG) (1949–1952) had their headquarters in the IG Farben Building, intentionally left undamaged by the Allies' wartime bombardment. The heavily destroyed city decided in the spirit of the time to plan a major reconstruction of the historical city center, retaining the old road system. The formerly independent city republic joined the state of Hesse in 1946. As the state capital was already at the smaller city of Wiesbaden and the American armed forces had used Frankfurt as their European headquarters, the city seemed most promising candidate for the West German federal capital. The American forces even agreed to withdraw from Frankfurt to make it suitable, as the British forces already had withdrawn from Bonn. Much to the disappointment of many in Frankfurt, however, the vote narrowly favored Bonn twice. Despite this, the mayor looked towards the future, seeing that with the division of Germany and relative isolation of Berlin, Frankfurt could take over positions in trade and commerce previously filled by Berlin and Leipzig. Since Bonn never played an important role despite its status as capital, Frankfurt, Hamburg, and Munich realigned themselves, passing from regional centers to international metropolises and effectively forming three West German cultural and financial capitals. Since the turn of the 2nd century, the Frankfurt fair has been held every fall and had become the most important fair site in Europe. Frankfurt's countless publishing houses as well as its fur industry profited from the elimination of Leipzig by the division of Germany into East and West. After the war, the West German book fair was held in Frankfurt. Since German reunification, the Frankfurt Book Fair is held in the fall, and Leipzig's in the spring. The bi-annual Internationale Automobil-Ausstellung is a worldwide car fair that is also held in Frankfurt. The Deutsche Bundesbank made Frankfurt its seat, and most major banks followed suit. This and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange have made the city the second most important commercial center in Europe, after London.  Jewish Frankfurt am Main  :See also Frankfurter Judengasse, Jewish Museum Frankfurt, People born and active in Frankfurt, History of the Jews in Germany, List of German Jews The date of the original organization of Frankfurt's Jewish community is uncertain. Probably no Jews were living in Frankfurt at the time of the first and second Crusades, as the city is not mentioned among the places where Jews were persecuted, although references occur to persecutions in the neighboring cities of Mainz and Worms. A Jew of Frankfurt is mentioned in connection with the sale of a house at Cologne between 1175 and 1191. Eliezer ben Nathan, rabbi at Mainz toward the end of the twelfth century, says that there were not then ten adult Jews in Frankfurt. The first reliable information concerning Frankfurt Jews dates from 1241, on May 24 of which year 180 Hebrews were killed during a riot and many fled, this being the first Judenschlacht or slaughter of the Jews. As the affair was detrimental to the income of the emperor, he was incensed with the city for seven years. King Conrad IV did not forgive the citizens until May 6, 1246. The emperor distributed the income he derived from the Jews so liberally among the princes and his retainers that he had little left for himself; yet the Jews remained under his protection. In 1286 King Rudolf pledged to Count Adolf of Nassau 20 marks yearly from the income derived from the Frankfurt Jews. When Adolf was made king under the title of \\"Adolf of Nassau\\", he pledged these 20 marks to the knight Gottfried of Merenberg (1292); and the latter again pledged 4 marks of this sum to the knight Heinrich of Sachsenhausen. King Adolf also gave 25 marks to Glottfried of Eppstein as a hereditary fief; and from 1297 he gave 300 marks yearly of the Jews' tax to the Archbishop of Mainz, adding to this sum 500 pounds of hellers in 1299. As early as 1303 the archbishop pledged 100 marks of this amount, and thus the Jews of the city of Frankfurt became subject to the archbishop. The emperor, however, attempted to exact still more money from the Jews, and it was only thanks to the resistance of the city that King Adolf did not succeed in 1292 in extracting from them the sum required for his coronation. The Jews were subject not only to the emperor and to the archbishop but also to the city; in 1331 King Ludwig recommended his \\"beloved Kammerknechte\\" to the protection of the municipality. Under Ludwig the Frankfurt Jews were accused of a crime and cruelly persecuted, and many fled. The king then confiscated the houses and other property of the fugitives and sold them to the municipal council for 3,000 pounds of hellers. Those Jews that returned had their property restored to them; and, as the Jews had been treated unjustly, the king promised not to punish them again but to be content with the verdict of the municipal council. The Jews were required, however, to pay to the king a new impost, the \\"goldene Opferpfennig.\\" = In the 14th century = During the Black Death (1349) the Jews of Frankfurt were again persecuted. At the beginning of these outbreaks the circumspect Emperor Charles IV, who feared for his income, pledged the Jews to the city for more than 15,000 pounds of hellers, stipulating that he would redeem them, which he never did. The Flagellants, on coming to Frankfurt, destroyed nearly the entire Jewish community, with the Jews in their distress setting fire to their own houses. Their property was confiscated by the council by way of indemnity. Jews returned to Frankfurt very gradually. In 1354 Charles IV renewed his pledge to the city; three years later the Archbishop of Mainz again advanced his claims, but the Jews and the council came to an agreement with him in 1358. In 1367 the city was again in full possession of the income derived from the Jews, but this did not prevent the emperor from occasionally levying extraordinary taxes; for example, Sigismund (1414) exacted a contribution from the Jews toward the expenses of the Council of Constance. The Jews were under the jurisdiction of the municipal council. Beginning with 1488, privileges (Judenstüttigkeiten) were issued that had to be renewed every three years. The Jews lived originally in the vicinity of the cathedral, this part of the city being necessary for their commerce; but Christians also lived there. Hence it was a hard blow to the former when they were forced, in 1462, to settle outside the old city ramparts and the moat. At first the city built their dwellings, but later they were required to erect their own houses, The Judengasse originally consisted merely of one row of houses; when this became overcrowded, a part of the moat was filled in, and houses were built upon the new ground thus obtained. There were three gates in the street, one at each end and one in the center. The cemetery of the community, which was situated on the Fischerfeld and is still in existence, is mentioned for the first time in 1300, but a tombstone dated July, 1272, has been preserved. Among the communal buildings were the synagogue (called also the \\"Judenschule\\"), the \\"Judenbadstube\\", the \\"Juden-Tanzhaus\\" or \\"Spielhaus\\", and the hospital. The Jewish inhabitants were more numerous in the early years of the community than later on: in 1241 they numbered about 200; in 1357 there were 12 tax-paying families; from 1357 to 1379, not more than 14 on the average; from 1401 to 1450, an average of 12; while in 1473 there were 17 families. = From the 15th to the 17th century = Toward the end of the Middle Ages the number of the Frankfurt Jews was considerably increased by emigrants from Nuremberg (1498); and Frankfurt replaces Nuremberg as the leading Jewish community in the empire. This is seen in the numerous requests made by other cities to the magistrates of Frankfurt for information concerning their method of procedure in cases affecting Jews.Neustadt in Zeitschrift für Geschichte der Juden in Deutschland, i. 190. Civil cases were decided by a commission of twelve, with the chief rabbi at its head. The reports of this commission from 1645 to 1808 are in the archives of the community. In 1509 the Jews were threatened with confiscation of their Hebrew books by Pfefferkorn, who arrived in the city with an imperial edict; on April 10, 1510, they were obliged to surrender all their books, which were not restored to them until June 6, after they had sent a special embassy to the emperor. In 1525 the impending danger of expulsion was averted by the municipal council; but the Jews were restricted in their commerce and were forbidden to build their houses higher than three stories. Although this measure crowded them more closely, there were 43 Jewish families in Frankfurt in 1543, and 454 in 1612.A list of these families was published in 1614; 2d ed., Mayence, 1678; republished in the \\"Israelit\\", Aug. 17, 1899 Hard times were now approaching. In 1612 the Jews of Frankfurt suffered much on account of some persons who were heavily indebted to them, chief among these being Fettmilch. On Aug. 22, 1614, these men headed an attack on the Jews' street, sweeping away everything in the space of thirteen hours; and the unfortunate Jews, who had sought refuge in the cemetery, begged for permission to depart. On the following day 1,380 Jews, glad to have saved even their lives, left the city and went to Offenbach, Hanau, and Höchst. The synagogue as well as the Torah-scrolls were destroyed, and the cemetery was desecrated. When the emperor heard of the affair he proscribed Fettmilch; but the Jews were not brought back until February 1616, when their street was placed under the protection of the emperor and the empire, as announced in a notice affixed to each of the three gates. By 1618 there were 370 families, living in 195 houses, of which 111 lay to the right of the Bornheimerpforte, and 84 to the left. The houses were of wood, with stone foundations, and were named according to signs suspended in front. The names were those of animals (e.g., ox, duck, wild duck), fruits (apple, red apple), trees (fir, elder, nut), or miscellaneous objects (tongs, scales, winecup); but sometimes a house was named simply from the color of the shield, e.g., red= \\"Rothschild\\"; black = \\"Schwarzschild.\\" The main synagogue was built in 1462; a smaller one was erected in 1603. Among the other communal buildings were the bath, to the east of the synagogue, the dance house, the inn, the slaughterhouse, the bakehouse, and the hospital. With their return to Frankfurt a new epoch in the history of the Jews of that city begins. They were still debarred from acquiring real estate, but they loaned money, even accepting manuscripts as pledges. The rate of interest, formerly as high as 24 percent, was now reduced to 8 percent. As the unredeemed pledges were sold, traffic in second-hand goods arose, which was further stimulated by the fact that the Jews were not permitted to sell new goods. They were also forbidden to deal in spices, provisions, weapons, cloth, and (from 1634 on) grain. But in spite of these interdictions, their commerce gradually increased. During the Thirty Years' War the Jews fared no worse than their neighbors. In 1694 there were 415 Jewish families; of these, 109 persons were engaged as moneylenders and dealers in second-hand goods; 106 dealt in dry goods, clothes, and trimmings; 24 in spices and provisions; 9 retailed wine and beer; 3 were innkeepers; and 2 had restaurants. Besides these there were the communal officials. = In the 18th century = The importance and status of the community at the beginning of the eighteenth century are indicated by the gracious reception accorded to the deputation that offered presents to Joseph I on his visit to Heidelberg in 1702. On Jan. 14, 1711, a fire which broke out in the house of Rabbi Naphtali Cohen destroyed the synagogue together with nearly the whole Judengasse. The rabbi was accused of having caused the fire by cabalistic means and was forced to leave the city. The 8,000 homeless Jews found shelter either in the pest house or with compassionate Christians. The synagogue and the dwelling houses were speedily rebuilt, and the street was widened six feet. In 1715 the community issued an edict against luxury. From 1718 onward the \\"Residenten\\", or representatives of the community of Frankfurt at Vienna, were accorded official recognition. In 1721 part of the Judengasse was again destroyed by fire. About the same period, conflicts with the Shabbethaians (a messianic Jewish sect) caused excitement in the community. In consequence of the denunciation of a baptized Jew the edition of the Talmud published at Frankfurt and Amsterdam between the years 1714 and 1721 was confiscated; and certain prayer books were likewise seized on account of the \\"Alenu\\" prayer. The books were restored, however, on Aug. 1, 1753, chiefly through the efforts of Moses Kann. The middle of the century was marked by the dissensions between the Kann and Kulp parties. The Kulp party, to which many influential men belonged, endeavored to harmonize the ancient constitution of the community with new measures for the benefit of the people; but their efforts were thwarted by the wealthy Kann family, whose influence was predominant both in the government of the community and among the people. In 1750 the two parties effected a compromise, which was, however, of but short duration. The community was further excited by Jonathan Eybeschütz's amulet controversy. In 1756 the Jews received permission to leave their street in urgent cases on Sundays and feast days for the purpose of fetching a physician or a barber or mailing a letter, but they were required to return by the shortest way. In 1766 the Cleve divorce controversy began to excite the rabbinate of Frankfurt also. At the coronation of Joseph II. the Frankfurt Jews were permitted for the first time to appear in public, when they swore allegiance to the emperor (May 28, 1764). The community of Frankfurt rendered great service in suppressing Eisenmenger's \\"Entdecktes Judenthum\\", confiscating all the copies in 1700. Eisenmenger sued the community for 30,000 gulden. Although he lost his case, proceedings were several times renewed with the aid of King Frederick I of Prussia, and only in 1773 was the community finally released from all claims brought by Eisenmenger's heirs. In 1753 there were 204 houses, built on both sides of the Jews' street. On May 29, 1774, a fire destroyed 21 dwellings, and the homeless again found shelter in the houses of Christians. When their houses were rebuilt, the Jews endeavored to remain outside of the ghetto but were forced to return by a decree of Feb. 13, 1776. One hundred and forty houses on the Jews' street were destroyed by fire when the French bombarded the city in 1796. = The Cemetery = Memorial to the 11,134 Frankfurt citizens killed during the Holocaust -Anne Frank's name is located in the center of the picture with a rock placed on her memorial. The Jewish cemetery, as mentioned above, is situated on the old Fischerfeld. In 1349 the cemetery was enclosed within the city moat and walls, which were fortified with jetties. Beginning in 1424 the neighboring communities also buried their dead there; but this privilege was withdrawn by the magistrate in 1505. When Frankfurt was besieged during the interregnum in 1552, a garrison with cannon was stationed in the cemetery, and an attempt was even made to force the Jews to sink the tombstones and to level the ground; but against this they protested successfully (July 15, 1552). During the Fettmilch riots the whole community spent the night of September 1, 1614, in the cemetery, prepared for death, and thought themselves fortunate when they were permitted to leave the city through the Fischerfeld gate on the following afternoon. In 1640 a dispute in regard to passage through the cemetery was decided in favor of the Jews. The community occasionally paid damages to Christians who were injured by the oxen (bekorim, the first-born that may not be used in accordance with Exodus xiii. 3) that grazed within the cemetery walls. In 1694 a neighboring garden was bought for the purpose of enlarging the cemetery. During the great fire of 1711 the Jews sought refuge withall their possessions among the tombs of the fathers. The communal baking ovens, which before the fire were behind the synagogue, were transferred to a new site acquired in 1694. The only building preserved from the flames was the hospital for the poor, near the cemetery; behind it, another hospital was built in 1715 to replace the one in the Judengasse that had been destroyed. A slaughterhouse for poultry and a fire station were erected between the ovens and the cemetery. The fire station existed down to 1882; the site of the ovens is now covered by the handsome building of the Sick Fund, and that of the Holzplatz and the garden by the Philanthropin schoolhouse. On the site of the two hospitals the Neue Gemeinde- Synagoge was built in 1882. The cemetery, covering more than , was closed in 1828; its epitaphs have been published by Dr. M. Horovitz. The end of the eighteenth century marks a new epoch for the Jews of Frankfurt. In 1796 they received permission to live among Christians. In 1811 the prince-primate granted them full civic equality. In 1809 they were already scattered throughout the city and had taken surnames. A reaction, however, came in 1816, when the city, on regaining its autonomy, completely excluded the Jews from the municipal government. In 1819 there were riots to the cry of \\"Hep-hep!\\", and the magistrate discussed the advisability of restricting the number of Jews to not more than 500 families and of assigning to them a special part of the city. These schemes, however, were not carried into effect. In 1853 the civic rights of the Jews were enlarged, and in 1864 all restrictions were removed. The synagogue that had been rebuilt after the fire of 1711 in the Judengasse was torn down in 1854, and a new synagogue was erected on the site (1855–60). The synagogue on the Börneplatz was consecrated in 1882. The Israelitische Religionsgesellschaft, an independent congregation founded in 1851 (incorporated 1900), built a synagogue in 1853 and enlarged it in 1874. In 1817 there were 4,309 Jews in Frankfurt; in 1858, 5,730; in 1871, 10,009; in 1880, 13,856; in 1890, 17,479; and in 1900, 22,000 in a total population of 288,489.

Volks-Kalender, 1882 et seq. = Publishing = The law of this free city decreeing that no Jew should establish a printing house there greatly impeded the development of Hebrew publishing in Frankfurt. Many books published there, especially prayer books, appeared without place of publication or publisher's name. Owing to this restriction, the printing requirements of Frankfurt were in large measure met by Jewish presses established in neighboring towns and villages, such as Hanau, Homburg, Offenbach, and Rödelheim, the last-named place being specially notable. Besides the local wants of Frankfurt there was the yearly fair which was practically the center of the German-Jewish book trade. In a measure the presses of the above four towns were really intended to supply the fair trade of Frankfurt. According to Wolf (\\"Bibl. Hebr.\\" ii. 1385), the history of Hebrew typography at Frankfurt-on-the-Main begins with 1625, in which year seliḥot were printed there. But Steinschneider and Cassel declare this statement doubtful. The chronogram of a certain prayer book seems to show that it was printed there in 1656, but this chronogram is known only from references to it in a second edition printed at Amsterdam in 1658 (\\"Cat. Bodl.\\" Nos. 2149, 2152). It may be said with certainty, however, that Hebrew printing began in Frankfurt not later than 1662, when the Pentateuch with a German glossary was printed. The books printed at Frankfurt up to 1676 do not bear any printer's name. From the year 1677 till the beginning of the eighteenth century there were two Christian printing establishments in Frankfurt at which Hebrew books were printed: (1) The press owned till 1694 by Balthasar Christian Wust, who began with David Clodius' Hebrew Bible; his last work was the unvocalized Bible prepared by Eisenmenger, 1694; up to 1707 the press was continued by John Wust. Among his typesetters who worked on the \\"Amarot Ṭehorot\\" (1698) and the responsa \\"Ḥawwot Yaïr\\" were two Christians: Christian Nicolas and John Kaspar Pugil. (2) That of Blasius Ilsnerus, who printed in 1682 the \\"Ḥiddushe Haggadot\\" of Samuel Edels. Many works that appeared in the last quarter of the seventeenth century without bearing the names of either printers or publishers probably belong to the publications of Isaac and Seligmann, sons of Hirz Reis, who in 1687 published a beautiful edition of the Yalḳuṭ. Although the proprietors of the presses were Christians, the publishers were often Jews; among them may be mentioned Joseph Trier Cohen (1690–1715), Leser Schuch, Solomon Hanau, and Solomon and Abraham, sons of Kalman, who in 1699 published through John Wust the Alfasi in three volumes. The greatest period of Hebrew publishing in Frankfurt was the first quarter of the eighteenth century. Hebrew books were printed in several establishments, including those of Mat. Andrea (1707–10), Jo. Ph. Andrea (1716), Nicolas Weinmann (1709), Antony Heinscheit (1711–19), and, above all, John Kölner, who during the twenty years of his activity (1708–27) furnished half of the Hebrew works printed at Frankfurt up to the middle of the nineteenth century. Among the more important works printed by Kölner may be mentioned the \\"Bayit Ḥadash\\", in 5 vols., corrected by Samuel Dresles (1712–16), and the continuation of the Babylonian Talmud (1720–23) begun at Amsterdam, between which city and Frankfurt there was a sort of partnership in printing. Kölner printed with the same Amsterdam type the \\"Yeshu'ah be- Yisrael\\" (1719–20). He then conceived the idea of printing the Alfasi after the model of the Sabbionetta edition of 1554, a copy of which was bought for 40 thalers. He resolved upon printing 1,700 copies at the price of 10 thalers each; the expenses, 11,000 thalers, were to have been obtained by means of a lottery; that is to say, each subscriber was entitled to a copy of the book and to a lottery ticket; but the whole plan miscarried. Between the years 1726 and 1736 no Hebrew printing appears to have been done in Frankfurt, and during the last three-quarters of the eighteenth century very few Hebrew works were printed there. Among those printed \\"Toledot Adam\\", a Hebrew letter-writer printed in 1736; and in 1742 the responsa \\"Sheb Ya'aḳob\\", the three Babot of the Jerusalem Talmud, and the second part of the \\"Pene Yehoshua'\\", the third part appearing in 1756. Abraham Broda's \\"Eshel Abraham\\" was issued in 1776. Hebrew printing has continued at Frankfurt up to the present day.

Early life and education Hammer was born in Vienna, Austria to Karl and Maria (Fuhrmann) Hammer. He began his apprenticeship in architecture at the age of fifteen in the studio of Camillo Sitte, author of Der Staedte-Bau nach seinen kuenstlerischen Graundsaetzen. In 1898, he transferred to the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna, which he left ten years later. Professional artist Hammer produced his first type design, Hammer Uncial, in 1921. In 1922, he moved to Florence, Italy, where he set up a printing press. In 1929, he moved his printing operation into the Villa Santuccio in Florence and named it the Stamperia del Santuccio. The first book that was printed in this operation was Milton's Samson Agonistes (1931), using what would be known as his Samson Uncial type. Punches for the type were cut by Paul Koch, son of Rudolf Koch. Hammer moved to Kolbsheim in Alsace in 1934, where he designed and built a chapel on an estate for a friend. From 1936 to 1939, Hammer lived in Vienna, where he served as professor at the Akademie der Bildenden Künste. In 1939, he fled the Nazis and immigrated with his first wife to the United States, leaving behind all his cutting and casting tools and most of his fonts. He taught at Wells College in Aurora, New York until 1948. Here, he produced American Uncial the best known of his five typefaces. In 1948, Hammer settled in Lexington, Kentucky and was artist-in-residence at Transylvania University, a post he held until retirement in 1953. While in Kentucky, Hammer was known for designing the official seal of Louisville, which was used until the city's city-county government merger in 2003. He also designed the seal for the University of Louisville, a portrait of Minerva, which has been used since the 1950s (although revised in the 1990s for better reproduction on screens). Hammer built his wooden press in 1927 with the help of local Florentine craftsmen based on a press in the Laurentian Library; in 1960, the Laurentian's press was discovered to be a copy constructed in 1818.Holbrook, p. 10. It was first used to print Samson Agonistes. When he closed his studio in 1933, the press was stored. In 1954, it was moved to the University of Kentucky where it has been in use by the King Library Press since 1959. Personal life and death Hammer was first married to Rosl Rossbach, and together they had two children, Veronika and Jacob. Hammer married Carolyn Reading in 1955. Carolyn Reading Hammer founded the King Library Press in 1956 and later became the University of Kentucky Libraries' curator of rare books. Since 1943, Carolyn Reading and Amelia Buckley had been printing at their Bur Press and their Chandler & Price printing press was moved to Bullock Place in Lexington when Carolyn and Victor Hammer married. This press, together with the antique-style wooden press Victor used in Florence in the 1920s, were both moved to the King Library Press at the University of Kentucky's M. I. King Library. During his life, Hammer was also good friends with Thomas Merton. Hammer hand printed the first edition of his work, The Wisdom of the Desert. Hammer died in Lexington on July 8, 1967 and is buried in the cemetery of Pisgah Presbyterian Church near Versailles, Kentucky. TypefacesNotesReferences * Holbrook, Paul Evans.

She recorded the 1973 hit song \\"Midnight at the Oasis\\" and continues to record albums in the folk traditions. She was the wife of musician Geoff Muldaur and is the mother of singer-songwriter Jenni Muldaur. Biography Muldaur was born Maria Grazia Rosa Domenica D'Amato in Greenwich Village, New York City, where she attended Hunter College High School.Johnston, Laurie. \\"Competition Intense Among Intellectually Gifted 6th Graders for Openings at Hunter College High School; Prominent Alumni Program for Seniors\\", The New York Times, March 21, 1977. Accessed May 11, 2010. Muldaur began her career in the early 1960s as Maria D'Amato, performing with John Sebastian, David Grisman, and Stefan Grossman as a member of the Even Dozen Jug Band. She then joined Jim Kweskin & the Jug Band as a featured vocalist and occasional violinist. During this time, she was part of the Greenwich Village scene that included Bob Dylan, and some of her recollections of the period, particularly with respect to Dylan, appear in Martin Scorsese's 2005 documentary film No Direction Home. She married fellow Jug Band member Geoff Muldaur, and after the Kweskin group broke up, the two of them produced two albums. She began her solo career when their marriage ended in 1972, but retained her married name. Her first solo album, Maria Muldaur, released in 1973, contained her hit single \\"Midnight at the Oasis\\", which reached number 6 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1974. It also peaked at number 21 in the UK Singles Chart. Later that year, she released her second album, Waitress in a Donut Shop. This included a re-recording of \\"I'm a Woman\\", the Leiber and Stoller number first associated with Peggy Lee and a standout feature from her Jug Band days. The title of this album is taken from a line in another song on the album, \\"Sweetheart\\", by Ken Burgan. Muldaur (left) with her band on stage at the 1983 Cambridge Folk Festival, England Muldaur at the Riverwalk Blues Festival in Fort Lauderdale, 1996 Around this time, Muldaur established a relationship with the Grateful Dead. Opening for some Grateful Dead shows in the summer of 1974, with John Kahn, bassist of the Jerry Garcia Band, eventually earned her a seat in that group as a backing vocalist in the late 1970s. Around the same time Muldaur met and eventually collaborated with bluegrass icon Peter Rowan. The two became close, and she was chosen to be the godmother of his daughter Amanda Rowan. She appeared on Super Jam (1989), the live recording of the German TV series Villa Fantastica, with Brian Auger on piano, Pete York on drums, Dick Morrissey on tenor saxophone, Roy Williams on trombone, Harvey Weston on bass and Zoot Money, also on vocals. Around 1980, Muldaur became a Christian and released a live album Gospel Nights. In 1983 she returned to secular music with Sweet and Slow, a set informed by vintage jazz and blues. Muldaur continued to perform, tour, and record after her success in the mid-1970s, including a turn at the Teatro ZinZanni in 2001. Her 2005 release, Sweet Lovin' Ol' Soul, was nominated for both a Blues Music Award (formerly the W.C. Handy Award) and a Grammy Award in the Traditional Blues category. In 2013, she was nominated for a Blues Music Award in the Koko Taylor Award (Traditional Blues Female) category. In 2003, Muldaur performed at Carnegie Hall in the Tribute to Peggy Lee produced by Richard Barone. In 2018 she performed in Barone's Central Park concert Music & Revolution along with John Sebastian and others from her Greenwich Village days. In 2019, she received the Trailblazer award at the Americana Music Honors & Awards.

It was created and written by Frank Miller and drawn by Dave Gibbons. The title of the series comes from a famous quotation by Patrick Henry: \\"I know not what course others may take but -- as for me -- give me liberty or give me death.\\" Overview Give Me Liberty was one of Frank Miller's two creator-owned (the other was Hard Boiled) titles he took to Dark Horse after deciding to stop working for DC Comics after a dispute over a proposed ratings system. The story is set in a dystopian near-future where the United States has split into several extremist factions, and tells the story of Martha Washington, a young African American girl from a public housing project called \\"The Green\\" (Chicago's Cabrini–Green). The series starts with Martha's birth and sees her slowly grow up from someone struggling to break free of the public housing project, to being a war hero and major figure in deciding the fate of the United States. The series was a mix of Miller's typical action sequences as well as being a political satire of the United States and its major corporations. The series proved to be a huge success for Dark Horse and was one of the biggest selling independent comics of the time. A trade paperback was later released and Miller followed up Give Me Liberty with several sequels continuing the story. All of these sequels were drawn by Dave Gibbons and published by Dark Horse. The titles of the original four issues of Give Me Liberty were: #Homes & Gardens #Travel & Entertainment #Health & Welfare #Death & Taxes Synopsis=Part 1: Homes & Gardens= In the then-future year of 1995, Martha Washington is born in a Chicago hospital. The following year, Martha’s father is killed during a protest over the African-American community's living conditions at the Cabrini–Green housing project. Meanwhile, newly elected President Erwin Rexall establishes a repressive dystopia, enforcing harsh economic policies that subject Martha's family to abject poverty while repealing the 22nd Amendment to ensure that he can run for more than two terms. As she grows up, Martha is an average student who displays a gift for computer programming. Her teacher, Donald, encourages her to perform better and brings her contraband items, such as a sandwich. One night, Martha shows up at Donald’s classroom and finds that he's been murdered by the Ice Man, a hulking criminal working for a local gangster called the Pope. Martha stabs the Ice Man with his own longshoreman’s hook, causing him to bleed to death. Martha is remanded to a psychiatric hospital, where she discovers that experiments are being secretly performed on children to genetically alter their minds, effectively turning them into human computers. National budget cuts eventually cause the hospital to shut down, leaving Martha homeless. Medical workers dispatched to round up the patients try to subdue Martha, but she kills one and takes his wallet. She is able to steal money from an ATM using his account card. In May 2009, Rexall is rendered comatose when the White House is bombed by Saudi Arabian terrorists in retaliation for an accidental misfire of an orbiting laser cannon that was intended to strike Libya, but strikes the Saudi oilfields instead. Nearly every successor in the hierarchy to the presidency is killed in the attack, leaving only the liberal Secretary of Agriculture, Howard Nissen, alive to take the post of president. Nissen proves to be an effective leader, ending years of scattered global wars being fought by Rexall's PAX Peace Force and sending troops to South America to fight the destruction of the rainforests by renegade cattle industrialists. Martha decides to join PAX and is sent to fight in South America. There, she experiences the physical and psychological horrors of combat, falling victim to a chemical weapon that permanently turns her hair blonde. She discovers a plot by her commanding officer, Lieutenant Stanford Moretti, to destroy large patches of the rainforest for the enemy. After Moretti shoots her and leaves her for dead, Martha stalks his unit and kills all of the troops under his command. Martha ends up wounding Moretti. While both recover in a hospital, Moretti blackmails Martha into becoming his unwitting servant. =Part 2: Travel & Entertainment= Martha helps PAX win several decisive battles, although Moretti takes nearly all the credit for her heroics. When the war finally ends with PAX victorious, Martha is decorated for bravery in combat while Moretti is promoted to colonel. Martha talks to President Nissen and convinces him to end the squalor at Cabrini-Green, and sends in PAX to aid in the effort. Martha is reunited with her mother. In 2011, Martha is charged with a mission to stop a white supremacist terrorist group from destroying the White House with a huge orbiting laser cannon. Martha kills the terrorists in the space station's control room, but not before the leader is able to voice the command to fire the pre-targeted cannon. Several terrorists fire at Martha with machine guns, ripping a large hole in the outer hull, causing the station to violently depressurize. While struggling to reach the station's computer room, Martha discovers a child test subject she encountered at the psychiatric hospital. Martha convinces her to stop the firing sequence. Both Martha and the child escape in a shuttle before the station explodes. Damage to the shuttle causes it to crash-land in the American southwest near the territory of the reorganized Apache Nation. Martha and her child companion, known as \\"Raggy Ann\\" (due to her resemblance to a Raggedy Ann doll), are taken as captives by the Apaches, who have been made chronically ill by pollution from an oil refinery they possess, a gift from Nissen himself. Martha forms a tense friendship with one of the Apaches, Wasserstein, who tells her that the Apaches' hostility stems from the poor treatment they've received in recent years, as well as throughout America’s history. Meanwhile, Colonel Moretti works behind the scenes as a treacherous adviser to President Nissen, who has become an alcoholic. In a drunken rage, Nissen murders his Vice President and signs an official document without reading it. The document, drafted by Moretti himself, orders the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs to use PAX's laser cannon to incinerate the Apache Nation. The attack will also kill Martha, a plan Moretti has been working toward for years. =Part 3: Health & Welfare= Martha learns of Moretti's plans from Raggy Ann, who is telepathic and can voice Moretti’s thoughts. She steals a Jeep and heads out into the desert; Wasserstein catches up to her vehicle and tries to stop her escape. At that moment, the laser cannon fires upon the Apache Nation. Martha looks directly at the blast and is blinded. The group is captured by the army of the Surgeon General, an insane separatist who controls the Pacific Northwest. He is also a religious fanatic who opposes pornography, rock music, birth control, and unclean environmental conditions. He uses a technique based on music to brainwash Martha and transform her into one of his soldiers. He also replaces her blinded eyes and renames her \\"Margaret Snowden.\\" Meanwhile, Moretti murders the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Lucius Spank, and stages his death as a suicide. Moretti also leaves the document authorizing the destruction of the Apache Nation at the scene, which devastates President Nissen’s administration when it becomes public. Moretti then joins the Cabinet in betraying and assassinating Nissen. However, Moretti betrays the conspirators and locks them inside the White House, which he rigs to explode. Moretti declares himself the country's interim leader and orders the destruction of the Surgeon General's stronghold, Fortress Health, by laser cannon. The Surgeon General counters with his own plan to launch hundreds of nuclear missiles at the laser cannon. He also reveals that he possesses Rexall’s brain, which he will use to create a clone of Rexall that will take office as president. Wasserstein formulates a plan to infiltrate Fortress Health and rescue Martha. Raggy Ann joins him, her telepathic abilities a useful asset. “Margaret” is dispatched to deal with Wasserstein, whom she shoots. She turns him and Raggy Ann over to Fortress Health authorities. Moments before, Raggy Ann had “uploaded” the memories that Martha lost during her brainwashing. She walks outside to the grounds of the fortress just as the Surgeon General orders the launch of his missiles. =Part 4: Death & Taxes= Moretti assumes command of PAX and is sequestered aboard a huge plane that he uses as a mobile command center. However, Moretti lacks the experience of a true leader and causes the United States to splinter further, with Brooklyn, Manhattan, Florida and Texas declaring independence and becoming poised to declare civil war. Moretti's attempts to negotiate with these factions fail rapidly and his obsessive pre-occupation with the Surgeon General is heavily criticized by his military advisers. Martha reports to the Surgeon General’s command center and he updates her on the situation. If the fortress is attacked, she will take Rexall’s brain, housed in a small, mobile container, and evacuate the area with it. Martha unexpectedly shoots the Surgeon General several times, revealing that he is actually a sophisticated robot. At the same time, Wasserstein, still alive, escapes confinement with Raggy Ann. They find the control room and Martha has Raggy Ann detonate one of the missiles, destroying them all. The cannon and its command crew are safe. Moretti sends all air forces to bomb Fortress Health. Martha takes Wasserstein, Raggy Ann, Rexall’s encased brain, and Rexall’s wife and escapes the bombing in a plane, with the still-functioning Surgeon General clinging to the plane’s exterior. Moretti is informed by his troops that Fortress Health has fallen but there is no sign of Martha or Rexall. Martha’s plane streaks away, pursued by Moretti himself. Moretti’s pilot fires missiles at Martha’s jet, but they hit the Surgeon General instead after he is blasted off the plane by the shotgun- wielding Martha. Martha and her weary fugitive group fly south to the Brazilian rainforest. They will be safe there since an executive order from the Nissen administration protects it from destruction by orbiting laser cannons. Moretti gathers a PAX unit of former criminals, some of whom have personal grudges with Martha. They hunt the fugitives in the rainforest. Martha and Wasserstein fight together using a box of surgical tools they find on the plane, killing nearly all of Moretti's unit. Moretti finds Rexall’s brain with his wife, whom he brutally murders. Martha finds Moretti and they engage in hand-to-hand combat. She overpowers and arrests him. The story closes in the year 2012. Rexall has been given a new robotic body and is easily voted back into office in a special election. Moretti stands trial for murder and treason and is sentenced to death by firing squad. Martha visits him the day he is to be executed and they talk for a while, Moretti showing obvious remorse for his actions. Martha gives him her belt and he hangs himself from a pipe in his cell.  Sequels  Give Me Liberty was followed by: * the five-issue series Martha Washington Goes to War in 1994, which was closely based on Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged. In this series, Rexall's increasingly corrupt government is subverted by the Surgeon General, who attempts a coup. Meanwhile, Martha is on the trail of the \\"Ghosts\\", a seditionist faction with an artificially-intelligent supercomputer. Joining up with the seditionists, Martha is instrumental in bringing down the corrupt government. * the one-shot issue Happy Birthday Martha Washington in March 1995, featuring: **\\"Collateral Damage\\", originally published in black and white under the title Martha Washington’s War Diary in the Dark Horse Presents Fifth Anniversary Special (1991) **\\"State of the Art\\", originally published in San Diego Comic-Con Comics #2 (1993) **\\"Insubordination\\" - In \\"Insubordination\\", which is set in Philadelphia on February 6, 2013, Martha is order to recover a sample of blood from Captain Kurtz, who is the inventor of a super soldier serum that has kept him young for 40 years. Captain Kurtz dies protecting the Liberty Bell from Nazi rebels. Martha succeeds in acquiring the blood sample but decides to destroy the blood sample because she believes that Captain Kurtz was the only person able to control the power of the serum. * the one-shot issue Martha Washington Stranded in Space in November 1995, featuring: **\\"Crossover\\", guest-starring The Big Guy. Martha investigates a space anomaly that temporarily sends her to Big Guy's reality. **\\"Attack of the Flesh Eating Monsters\\", originally published in black and white in Dark Horse Presents #100-4. Martha fights off an attack by monsters conforming to 1950s pulp-SF stereotypes; she discovers that this is merely a psychological study conducted by the world-controlling AI. The AI's plot is a satire of the conclusion of Gibbons' Watchmen, as a character plots to unite the world through the fake threat of alien invasion. * the three-issue series Martha Washington Saves the World in 1997. An actual alien spaceship arrives, and Martha uses its superior technology to defeat the megalomaniacal AI. * the one-shot issue Martha Washington Dies in 2007Martha Washington Dies in July: Talking to Diana Schutz , Newsarama, March 27, 2008 There is an additional Martha Washington story \\"Logistics\\", which was published exclusively as part of a comic distributed with the Martha Washington action figure. In \\"Logistics\\", the story, which is set on June 13, 2012, reveals that the 94th Amendment to the US Constitution strictly forbids the breeding, slaughter, or sale of red meat; but that does not stop Martha and PAX from eating meat burgers when their logistics train runs out of food. Because of the ban on red meat, most of the American Southwest and all of the Mexican Territory secede from the United States, which call themselves Real America. Collected editions On September 9, 2009, Dark Horse released a 600-page hardcover titled The Life and Times of Martha Washington in the Twenty First Century.

High school and college years Raftery attended Saint Cecilia High School in Kearny, New Jersey, where he starred in basketball and became the all-time leading scorer in state history with 2,192 points, a record finally surpassed after 35 years. He earned all-state honors in basketball and led his team to the state championship in his senior season. He was also named all-state in baseball and soccer. He has been named, retroactively, Mr. Basketball USA for 1959. Raftery played at La Salle University under coach Donald \\"Dudey\\" Moore. During his freshman year he scored a freshman record 370 points, followed by a team leading 17.8 points per game in his sophomore year. As a senior, he co-captained the Explorers to the National Invitation Tournament. Following his senior year at La Salle, Raftery was selected in the 14th round (82nd overall) of the 1963 NBA draft by the New York Knicks but never played in the NBA. Coaching career Raftery began his coaching career at Fairleigh Dickinson University at Madison (now in Florham Park, New Jersey) where he was the head basketball coach from 1963 to 1968. Also, Raftery coached golf and served as associate athletic director. From 1970 to 1981, he was the head coach of Seton Hall University, where he posted a 154–141 record and led the Pirates to four ECAC post-season tournaments and two National Invitational Tournament appearances. In 1979, he was named Coach of the Year by the New Jersey Sports Writers Association. His 154 wins as a coach places him fifth on the all-time list at Seton Hall behind Honey Russell, P.J. Carlesimo, Frank Hill, and Kevin Willard. =Head coaching record=Broadcasting career Richard Pitino and Raftery (left) in 2011 Raftery has consecutively served as an analyst and play-by-play announcer for CBS Sports' college basketball coverage for over 33 years. Raftery was also an analyst with ESPN, primarily partnered with Sean McDonough and Jay Bilas and formerly Mike Gorman for Big East games. He has also served as an analyst for CBS Radio/Westwood One's coverage of the NCAA Men's Final Four along with Kevin Kugler and John Thompson. Raftery has also served as an analyst for the New Jersey Nets (prior to the franchise's move to Brooklyn) and was an on- course commentator for PGA Tour Champions Tour events. On June 27, 2013, Raftery signed with Fox Sports to call Big East basketball games on the upstart network Fox Sports 1 with Gus Johnson. During CBS' coverage of March Madness, Raftery (prior to the 2015 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament) had been frequently partnered with Verne Lundquist. His trademark quotes include: \\"Onions!\\" (whenever a shot is made late in a close game), \\"Send It In Big Fella!\\" (whenever a post player makes a slam dunk), \\"With a Little Kiss!\\" (when a shot banks in, usually in a nonstandard way), \\"A Little Nickel-Dimer!\\" (whenever a light foul is called), and \\"A Little Lingerie On The Deck!\\" (whenever a player makes a nifty move with the ball and fakes out the defender). He is especially remembered for \\"Send It In, Jerome!\\", his call immediately after Jerome Lane of the University of Pittsburgh shattered the backboard with a powerful dunk during a 1988 game. Another phrase he is known for is 'Man-to-man'. He announces it in a very fast and excited voice at the start of all games when the defending team is in that defense.Rolling Stone - April 2, 2015 Starting with the 2014–15 collegiate basketball season, CBS/Turner Sports partnered Raftery with Jim Nantz and Grant Hill to make up the primary announcing team for the remainder of the regular season, all the way through the NCAA men's basketball tournament and the Final four. On June 8, 2015, Raftery was inducted into the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association's Hall of Fame. He also won the Sports Emmy Award for Outstanding Sports Event Analyst in 2015 and 2016. Other ventures Aside from his commentating duties, Raftery was also the president of W.J. Raftery Associates, an event/marketing firm. Personal life Born William Joseph Raftery in Orange, New Jersey, Bill Raftery grew up in an Irish Catholic family with Irish immigrant parents. His sister is a nun. Raftery earned a B.A. in history from La Salle University in 1963 and an M.A.E. in education from Seton Hall University in 1966. In 2001, he received an honorary doctorate from La Salle. He lives in Florham Park, New Jersey with his wife, Joan, and has four children and five grandchildren. His son, Billy, produced and narrated a documentary entitled, With a Kiss, about his father's life in basketball. The documentary premiered hours before the longtime broadcaster called his second Final Four as a television analyst for CBS Sports.

The Convoy of 35 (or the Lamed He, which stands for \\"thirty five\\" in Hebrew numerals), was a convoy of Haganah fighters sent during the 1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine on a mission to reach by foot and resupply the blockaded kibbutzim of Gush Etzion in January 1948, after earlier motorized convoys had been attacked. They were spotted before they could reach their target and killed in a prolonged battle by Arab irregulars and local villagers. History January 1948 casualties of the \\"Convoy of 35\\" being brought to burial A monument commemorating the 35 fallen fighters On 16 January 1948, a convoy of 38 men was sent by the Haganah to deliver supplies to the four blockaded kibbutzim of Gush Etzion, south of Jerusalem, following an Arab attack on January 14.Gershom Gorenberg (2007) The Accidental Empire: Israel and the Birth of the Settlements, 1967-1977 Macmillan, p 20 The unit, named in Hebrew \\"Machleket HaHar\\" (lit. Mountain Platoon), set out on foot from Hartuv at 11 p.m. on January 15, commanded by Dani Mass. They took a detour around the Tegart fort-type Palestine Police station, to avoid detection by the British.Arieh O'Sullivan, A Magnificent Disaster, Jerusalem Post, Jan 16, 1998 Three were sent back because one man sprained an ankle, and two accompanied him. The remaining 35 were killed by Arab villagers and militiamen between the villages of Jaba' and Surif.Dov Knoh (1958) Siege in the hills of Hebron: the battle of the Etzion Bloc p 102 The fate of the 35 was reconstructed from British and Arab reports. The six hours of night that remained did not suffice for the trip. About an hour before the convoy reached their destination, it became light. Their presence was discovered by two Arab women who encountered two scouts of the group near Surif.Nadav Shragai, The legend of ambushed Palmach squad '35', Haaretz.com English edition, http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1081380.html, April 27, 2009, last accessed May 2, 2009 (An earlier version, that the soldiers were discovered by an Arab shepherd who they graciously let go, was based on a eulogy written by Ben-Gurion and is apparently apocryphal.) A large number of armed villagers from Surif and other communities gathered to block the way. The battle was fought in two stages, four hours apart, with hundreds of Arabs from a nearby training base taking part.Newspaper interview with Yohanan Ben- Yaakov: \\"The 35's Second Battle\\" (הקרב השני של הל\\"ה), Makor Rishon, 14 January 2005. . The Haganah force battled until it ran out of ammunition. The last of the 35 was apparently killed at about 4:30 p.m. Among the dead were Tuvia Kushnir, one of the country's most promising botanists, Moshe Perlstein, an American-born World War II veteran who had made aliyah in 1947, and three members of the Hebrew Communist Party.The Scotsman, Monday 19 January 1948: \\"The dead include three members of the Hebrew Communist Party. Also an American. Moshe Periman, a former GI of Brooklyn, New York. He is the first American killed in the Palestinian civil war.\\" A phone conversation about the battle was intercepted by the Irgun, in which it was heard that many were killed and some were wounded. After no word of the 35 had been received for a long time and wounded Arabs started arriving at Hebron, the British dispatched a platoon of the Royal Sussex Regiment to investigate. After threatening and exhorting the village mukhtars and notables, the British were led to the site of the battle where they found the bodies of the 35. According to some reports the bodies had been mutilated beyond recognition. According to one account the last three Jews to die blew themselves up with a grenade. This account also reports that several Arab sources claimed a young woman was amongst those killed, and that to restore public confidence in the Jewish fighting forces the Palmach launched an attack on the village of Sa'sa' on 14 February in which 60 villagers were killed.Kurzman, Don (1970) Genesis 1948. The First Arab-Israeli War. An Nal Book, New York. Library of Congress number 77-96925. pp.52,53 A contemporary report puts the number of casualties in Sa'sa at 11 killed and 3 wounded,The New York Times, Feb 16, 1948, page 1. but official sources confirm the figure of 60 killed with 20 houses destroyed. Burial After the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, when the bodies of the 35 were returned to Israel, only 23 of the 35 bodies could be identified. To solve the problem, Rabbi Aryeh Levin performed the rare goral ha-gra (ha-gra = Vilna Gaon) ceremony, a process in which the reader of the Torah is led to certain verses which give hints as to the subjects in question.Raz, Simcha (1976). A Tzaddik in Our Time: The life of Rabbi Aryeh Levin. Spring Valley, NY: Philipp Feldheim. pp. 139,162–165.

They built a memorial commemorating the fallen Haganah soldiers there (see picture). Prior to the 1967 Six-Day War, it was assumed that the precise location of the final battle was on the Jordanian side of the armistice line. However, in 1967 the British police officer who had found the bodies in 1948 and Arab witnesses independently identified a hilltop on the Israeli side of the line.U. Milstein, History of Israel's War of Independence, Vol III. English edition: University Press of America 1998, p29. The story of the 35 was immortalised in a poem, Here Our Bodies Lie by Haim Gouri.

The southern terminus of SR 501 is at an interchange with U.S. Route 33 (US 33) just south of Wapakoneta, which is also the western terminus for SR 67 and the southern terminus for SR 198\\\\. The route runs concurrently with both of the latter two routes into Wapakoneta, and with SR 198 only north of the city. SR 501’s northern terminus is at SR 117 approximately west of Lima. SR 501 was commissioned in 1937, along most of the same route as today. The highway was paved by 1939. In 1961, the southern terminus of the route was moved to its current terminus. Route description SR 501 heads north from an interchange with US 33\\\\. The road is concurrent with SR 67 and SR 198\\\\. The highway passes through industrial properties while paralleling CSX railroad tracks. After paralleling the tracks the route crosses them and enters downtown Wapakoneta. In downtown the road passes through residential properties. SR 67 turns east and SR 198 and SR 501 turn west. The street passes allow the south side of the Auglaize County Court House. After two blocks SR 198 and SR 501 turn north and crosses the Auglaize River. Here, SR 501 has its highest traffic counts; within the 2011 ODOT survey, the road is listed with an average annual daily traffic (AADT) of 9,450 vehicles on a section of highway over the river. After crossing the river, SR 198 and SR 501 turn northwest leaving downtown Wapakoneta. On the north side of the city SR 501 leaves SR 198 and heads due north. After leaving SR 198, SR 501 passes through a mix of commercial and residential properties, before leaving Wapakoneta. North of Wapakoneta the roadway passes through farmland, with some houses. The highway enters Hume and crosses the Western Ohio Line of the R.J. Corman Railroad. In Allen County the AADT drops to 3,160 vehicles. After Hume, the route passes through farmland and a group of house before ending at an intersection with SR 117\\\\. Continuing north after SR 501 ends is Township Road 91 (T–91). The highway is not incorporated within the National Highway System. History When first established in 1937, SR 501 ran from downtown Wapakoneta to its current northern terminus at SR 117. The entire route was paved by 1939. When a new southern bypass of Wapakoneta was completed in 1961 and US 33 was re-routed along it, SR 501, along with SR 67 and SR 198, were extended south from downtown along Willipie Street to a new common terminus at the re-routed US 33.The highway has not experienced any major changes since 1961.

It is the latest version of a pod produced for the UKMoD and the RAF Jaguar force, originally developed and produced by W. Vinten Ltd. The original designation of the pod was Jaguar Replacement Reconnaissance Pod (JRRP) and after successfully entering service in the 1990s it was subsequently redesignated DJRP, and fitted to a wide range of other aircraft. The current sensors are an 8042 EO sensor and a Super Vigil IR sensor; these feed digital data to two recording modules which provide storage. The pod functions are controlled by a reconnaissance management system, enabling both pre-planned and pilot-initiated events to be recorded. The sensors are configured to provide wide area coverage; the EO sensor records at both long and short range, providing a stand-off capability, while the IR sensor records a horizon-to-horizon image based on the aircraft's flightpath. The recorded data is either downloaded from the recording modules after flight, or can be called up by ground stations via a datalink. Along with the Networked Imagery Exploitation System (NIES), the system provides high resolution tactical reconnaissance imagery, has been used in Operation Telic and currently provides reconnaissance capability to British forces in Afghanistan. The equipment has also been exported. The DJRP has recently been integrated onto the Saab Gripen for the South African Air Force.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a first baseman and left fielder from through . A five-time All-Star, Sievers was the American League home run leader and RBI champion. He played for the St. Louis Browns, Washington Senators, Chicago White Sox, Philadelphia Phillies, and the expansion Washington Senators. Sievers batted and threw right-handed. Biography Sievers was born in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1926; he was nicknamed \\"Squirrel\\" as a schoolboy basketball star. He won the American League (AL) Rookie of the Year and TSN Rookie of the Year awards in 1949, batting .306 with 16 home runs and 75 RBI. He struggled to .238 in 1950, and for the next three years he suffered shoulder and arm injuries that limited his playing time to 134 games. He was traded to the Washington Senators for Gil Coan before the season. Sievers in 1959 In Washington, Sievers collected 95 or more RBI and played at least 144 games during five consecutive years (1954–58) and made the AL All-Star team three times (1956–57, 1959). His most productive season came in , when he led the league in home runs (42), RBI (114), extra base hits (70) and total bases (331), batting .301. He finished third in the MVP ballot with four first-place votes and 205 points –Mickey Mantle got six and 233, Ted Williams five and 209. On April 4, , Sievers went to the Chicago White Sox in the same trade that sent Earl Battey and Don Mincher to Washington. In his first year with the Sox, he hit .295 with 28 home runs and 93 RBI, and had almost an identical season in 1961, hitting .295 with 27 home runs and 92 RBI, making his fourth All-Star appearance. From 1962 to 1964, Sievers remained productive with the Philadelphia Phillies in the National League. In the 1964 midseason, his contract was sold to the AL expansion Senators, and he played his final game on May 9, 1965. Sal Maglie, star pitcher for the New York Giants who specialized in throwing the curveball, used Sievers as an example of a curveball hitter in a 1958 article for Sports Illustrated. At the time of his death in 2017, Sievers was the oldest living member of the expansion Senators team. At a time when achieving 300 home runs was still a rarity, he became only the 22nd ballplayer to reach the plateau. He also shares the dubious distinction with Gil Hodges of being one of the first two major leaguers to hit 300 career home runs and not make the Baseball Hall of Fame. Sievers hit his 300th home run on July 19, 1963. Hodges hit No. 300 on April 23, 1958. In a 17-season career, Sievers was a .267 hitter with 318 home runs, 1,703 hits, and 1,147 RBI, in 1,887 games. Defensively, he compiled a career .989 fielding percentage. After his playing career ended, he served one season (1966) as a coach for the Cincinnati Reds and managed in the minor leagues. Sievers was one of only nine players to don the uniform of both the original and expansion Washington Senators teams, the others being Rudy Hernández, Héctor Maestri, Don Mincher, Camilo Pascual, Pedro Ramos, Johnny Schaive, Zoilo Versalles, and Hal Woodeshick. Sievers died in his home in Spanish Lake, Missouri, on April 3, 2017, aged 90.

It is the third and final \\"sideshow\\" entry in the group's Dark Carnival saga.  Background  Unsatisfied with their contract with Jive Records, Insane Clown Posse's manager, Alex Abbiss, set up a deal which would sign the group with Hollywood Records. After their Jive contract expired, ICP had two days on their own before officially being signed to Hollywood, so they decided to record and release an EP independently on Psychopathic Records. The EP consisted of \\"love songs\\" performed in the duo's trademark style. Like The Terror Wheel, there is a hidden track at the end which contains a phone number, which could be called to reveal the name of the next Joker's Card, The Great Milenko.  Release and reception  Tunnel of Love was released with an alternate pornographic album cover, which became rare and much sought after among fans. To promote the EP, Psychopathic sent out a pink Tunnel of Love van with flowers on it. However, this promotional tactic proved to be incomprehensible to many people, who did not understand what the van was promoting, and onlookers yelled homophobic insults at the drivers. After much disagreement between the heads of Psychopathic Records, label don Billy Bill pulled the van over and removed the wrapping promoting the EP. The album was released in an alternate version with a pornographic album cover, and a bonus track, \\"Mental Warp\\". The cover was derived from a pornographic film VHS cover which depicted an actor with an erect penis standing next to two women, one of which is holding the erection in her hands. The actor's face was replaced by Shaggy 2 Dope's. Because no stores would stock the album with this cover and it was sold mostly at Insane Clown Posse's concerts, this edition became rare and sought after by fans. Allmusic did not review the album, but gave it 3 out of 5 stars.[ Allmusic review] \\"Mental Warp\\", the bonus track from the XXX edition of the album, also appeared on the compilation Forgotten Freshness Volumes 1 & 2\\\\. The songs \\"Cotton Candy\\" and \\"Super Balls\\" appeared in the film Big Money Hustlas. The song \\"Super Balls\\" originated the Juggalo slang \\"Whoop whoop!\\", which is used as a greeting among fans. The greeting and the song were also referenced in Twiztid's song \\"Meat Cleaver\\", which appeared on their 1997 debut Mostasteless.

It occurs primarily in the arid regions of the Southwestern United States in the states of Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, and Nevada. It is often conspicuous because of its shrubby or even tree-like size, its silhouette, and its long-lasting yellowish fruits. Distribution and habitat The cane cholla's range is the arid regions of Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Oklahoma, and Texas, south to Durango, Zacatecas, and San Luis Potosí. It occurs at altitudes from and is hardy for a cactus (USDA Zone 5A). In parts of its range, often just below the pinyon-juniper belt, it can be abundant, surrounded by low grasses and forbs that are brown most of the year; in such places chollas are conspicuous as the only tall green plant. Plants may form thickets or be spaced at a few times their width in \\"gardens\\". The species a noxious invasive of Australia in old mining localities and along watercourses. It is known there by the common names of Devil's rope cactus or Devil's rope pear. It is a declared noxious weed in New South Wales and also occurs in Queensland, Northern Territory,Victoria and South Australia. Description The above-ground part consists of much-branched cylindrical stems, the end joints being about in diameter. The joints, unlike those of some chollas, are hard to detach. The stems are highly tubercular (lumpy) with a pattern of long oval lumps. A typical height is about , but exceptionally it can grow to with a \\"trunk\\" diameter of . The width is often similar to or somewhat greater than the height. The stems are armed with clusters of up to about 10 red to pink spines, which may be long and are barbed and sharp enough to easily penetrate leather gardening gloves. The stems and fruits also have many spines or \\"glochids\\" about long that can detach and stick in the skin. There are two kinds of stems or \\"cladodes\\": long plagiotropic, bearing flowers at the ends and falling off after a few years, and long orthotropic, primarily serving for support and transport and staying on the plant. Plagiotropic stems grow in a star- or crown-like pattern around a central orthotropic stem. This species blooms in late spring or early summer. The flowers are purple or magenta, rarely rose-pink, about wide. The fruits are yellowish, tubercular like the stems, and shaped something like the frustum of a cone, with a hollow at the wide end where the flower fell off; they are often mistaken for flowers. The plant retains them all winter. They are dry and not tasty, though the Indians of Arizona and New Mexico are said to have eaten them. In addition to sexual reproduction, the tree cholla reproduces when stem joints fall to the ground and take root. Thus this species spreads and its spread is hard to control, especially where animals defecate seeds and carry stem joints stuck to their hide some distance from the parent plant. (Some cows, \\"cholla eaters\\", learn to eat cholla fruits despite the pain.) \\"Waves of invasion\\" typically occur four or five years after drought combined with grazing, probably because this combination exposes soil on which the stem joints can take root. Ecology Curve-billed thrasher in cover. The fruits are also eaten by various wild birds and mammals, including pronghorn, desert bighorn sheep, and deer. The thorny plants provide escape for cover for many small animals. The leafcutter bee Lithurgus apicalis has been observed to pollinate the flowers. (Subscription required.) Uses The plants are sometimes grown as ornamentals. Dead stems decay to leave a hollow wooden tube with a pattern of lengthwise slits. These are sometimes used as canes or to make curios. The Roman Catholic Penitentes of New Mexico formerly tied fresh stems to their bare backs in Holy Week processions. The Zuni people use the imbricata variety ceremonially.Stevenson, Matilda Coxe 1915 Ethnobotany of the Zuni Indians.

It is the highest peak of the Massif des Écrins and the Dauphiné Alps and the most southerly alpine peak in Europe that is higher than 4,000 m. It is the only 4,000 m mountain in France that lies outside the Mont Blanc Massif. Before the annexation of Savoy in 1860 it was the highest mountain in France.  Geography  The south face of Barre des Écrins =Location= The Barre des Écrins is the highest peak in the Provence-Alpes- Côte d'Azur region including all of Occitania and the Southern Alps. It is located in the commune of Pelvoux and is situated near the Drainage divide between the Durance and the Vénéon. This divide passes 250 metres west of the summit, along the ridge that leads to the summit of the sub-peak Dôme des Écrins (4088 metres). The south face of the mountain is rocky while the north face is ice as it is the starting point of the Glacier Blanc. The mountain is surrounded by four glaciers: to the north-west is the Bonne Pierre glacier, to the north-east the Glacier Blanc, to the south-west the Glacier du Vallon de la Pilatte, and finally in the south-east the Glacier Noir. It is separated from the Snow Dome of Écrins (4015 m) by the Lory Gap (3974 m) to the west, the Barre Noir (3751 m) by the Écrins Gap (3661 m) to the north-east and by Fifre (3699 m) via the Col des Avalanches (3499 m) to the south. =Geology= The mountain consists of migmatized gneiss, an acidic rock composed of quartz- feldspar. On the upper slopes there is an amphibolic face over the top of the migmatized gneiss forming the top. These formations overlap a large granite Pluton that forms the summit of Pelvoux.Geological Map of France at 1:50000 consulted on InfoTerre (Saint-Christophe-en-Oisans page). J.-C. Barfêtry and A.

The mountains are actually located on the borders of the Oisans and Briançonnais with the highest point completely in Briançonnais. They were sometimes called \\"point of Arsines\\" by locals. The Englishmen A. W Moore, Horace Walker, and Edward Whymper, guided by Michel Croz from Chamonix and Christian Almer from Switzerland, made the first ascent of the Barre des Écrins on 25 June 1864. They cut steps on the north face of the Barre until they reached the top of the eastern edge via the Whymper corridor. They then reached the top of this high ridge which was composed of very unstable rocks. Edward Whymper described the ascension in his book Scrambles Amongst the Alps in the Years 1860-69.Richard Goedeke, 4000 des Alpes, Libris, coll. Les Guides Libris, June 2007, 22 pages.Scrambles Amongst the Alps in the Years 1860-69, Edward Whymper, Chapter IX p. 201-221 William Auguste Coolidge made the first direct climb up the north face of the Barre des Ecrins in July 1870 by cutting 500 steps.Barre des Écrins, summitpost.org. The first ascent without a guide is credited to Frederick Gardiner in 1878 accompanied by Charles and Lawrence Pilkington. The southern face was climbed for the first time in 1880 by Pierre Gaspard together with Henri Duhamel. The south pillar, a part of the Black glacier ending at the top, was climbed for the first time in 1944 by the famous couple of climbers Jeanne and Jean Franco.  Ascent  South face of the Barre (on the right). Below is Coolidge Peak and Le Fifre. The Barre des Écrins attracts many climbers and has many routes to the top.Topo Mountaineering, The Ways to the top. The mountain is traditionally scaled from the Pré de Madame Carle in the valley of Ailefroide. The normal route climbs the entire length of the Glacier Blanc. This is a much-used route, because it is the usual way to the Dôme des Écrins, one of the most easily climbed 4,000 m alpine peaks. It starts from the Refuge des Écrins and climbs the north face almost up to the Lory saddle (3,974 m), where the routes to the Dôme and the Barre divide. The ascent of the Barre continues by a rocky arête all the way to the summit. The guides from La Bérarde have equipped the Col des Écrins with cables allowing them to bring their clients to the summit. Other more challenging routes to the summit exist, such as the South Face rated AD (Fairly Difficult). The quality of the rock on the mountain ranges from poor to average and especially on the South Face of the mountain the risk of rockfall is significant. It is possible to climb the Direct Coolidge in late spring directly to the summit with crampons and an ice axe. Depending on snow conditions, this route can also be done on skis. The south-north traverse of the Barre des Écrins bar is also one of the classic routes of the massif. In summer it is possible to climb a steep path on the south face with the Pilier Sud being the most traveled route. The record for an ascent on foot is 1 hour 55 minutes by Mathéo Jacquemoud in June 2012, starting from Pré de Madame Carle (1874 m) by the normal route of the Dôme and the Whymper corridor. He beat the old record by Hubert Fievet (2 hours 3 minutes in 1998).A record on the barre des Écrins. The record for round-trip ski mountaineering is 2 hours 51 minutes by Nicolas Bonnet in 2009 from the Pré de Madame Carle.Record of Écrins alpine skiing 2009.

They do this by patrolling the store in plain clothes looking to identify members of the public who are stealing from the store. More common terms today with major retailers are loss prevention agent, detective or investigator and asset protection officer. Special officer, once common, is now rarely used, as few jurisdictions still allow it.  Overview  Store detectives may be self-employed on a contract basis but most are employees of the retailer, or of a security firm with an outsourcing arrangement with the retailer, or of an agency with a similar agreement. The job involves patrolling stores in the role of an ordinary shopper, watching for shoplifters. The detective observes any shopper behaving suspiciously and keeps a mental record of such observations. The objective of the store detective is to observe a complete crime taking place. They achieve this by observing a shoplifter approaching an item, appropriating the item (picking it up), concealing the item (not always) and leaving the store having not paid for said item. The key difference between a store detective and a security guard is that the former's role is covert. If they observe an individual shoplifting, they may detain them as they attempt to exit the store or apprehend the suspect(s) during the theft. Laws vary greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction regarding what constitutes the crime of shoplifting and how a suspect may be detained/arrested. In Canada, detectives may arrest the individual utilizing powers given to them by the Criminal Code. It is standard practice that stores require their detectives to have stable work histories and no criminal record. Common backgrounds include the armed services, fire and rescue services, security and policing. In the UK, distance learning courses in store detection are offered by many organisations and the store detective must be in receipt of an SIA (Security Industry Agency) license. Training in security studies is available from numerous training providers – at various levels.  Additional responsibilities  Many retail companies assign the task of investigating check and credit card fraud activity as well as employee theft activity to the store detective. They work closely with law enforcement on such cases whether it is on the local, state or federal level. Companies sometimes also assign the store detective the task of searching employee lockers and bags at random. Typically store detectives in retail are commonly known either as loss prevention or asset protection. Management and field investigator functions also exist commonly within the loss prevention/asset protection sector of retail.  Techniques and tools of the trade  A store detective has several techniques that they use to detect shoplifters. Keen observational skills is the primary weapon alongside good teamwork with security guards and the use of CCTV. An ability to blend in with other shoppers in a variety of shopping environments is also key. They usually have a clear understanding of the law as it applies to their role depending on jurisdiction. Most store detectives are unarmed but are trained in arrest and restraint techniques. Some also carry covert microphone and earpieces attached to a radio (sometimes radio-linked to shopping centres and other retail establishments) in order to effectively monitor suspected shoplifters as they move through an area.

A network implementing NCS is designed according to the media gateway control protocol architecture for interconnecting a packet network with the traditional public switched telephone network (PSTN). This architecture physically decomposes the functionality of providing complete end-to-end multimedia telecommunication sessions into several discrete components, notably a media gateway (MG) located at the customer premises that performs the physical translation between analog voice or video streams to packetized digital data, and a media gateway controller (MGC) which is a centralized server that controls typically many media gateways and manages the complexity of call setup, resource negotiation, call routing, and tear-down. In addition, the architecture also uses signaling gateways to the traditional telecommunication channels, such as SS7-based networks. Like MGCP, NCP is a device control protocol defining the interaction between the MGC, also called a call agent, and its media gateways. It is one layer of the PacketCable suite of specifications and relies upon companion protocol specifications to provide complete end-to-end telecommunication functionality. Network-based Call Signaling is a modification of the Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP). NCS provides a PacketCable profile of an application programming interface (MGCI), and a corresponding protocol (MGCP) for controlling voice-over-IP (VoIP) embedded clients from external call control elements. An embedded client is a network element that provides: *Two or more traditional analog (RJ11) access lines to a packet-based telecommunication network. *Optionally, one or more video lines to a VoIP network MGCI functions provide for connection control, endpoint control, auditing, and status reporting. They each use the same system model and the same naming conventions. The modification of MGCP in the NCS profile include the following: NCS only aims at supporting PacketCable- embedded clients. Functionality present in the MGCP 1.0 protocol, which was superfluous to NCS, has been removed. It contains extensions and modifications to MGCP. However, the MGCP architecture, and all of the MGCP constructs relevant to embedded clients, are preserved in NCS. The NCS protocol contains minor simplifications of MGCP 1.0.

As Bitòn Coulibaly tightened his control over Ségou, capital of his newly founded Bambara Empire, a faction of Ségou Bambara dissatisfied with his rule fled west. In 1753, they founded the kingdom of Kaarta on the homeland of the long-defunct Ghana Empire, taking Nioro du Sahel as their capital. The kingdom was destroyed as an independent force in 1854 by El Hadj Umar Tall's jihad across West Africa; Umar Tall seized Nioro, and put the Kaarta king (Fama) Mamady Kandian and his entire family to death. In 1878 the French governor of Senegal Briere de l'Isle sent a French force against the Kaarta Toucouleur vassal state along the north bank of the Senegal River. Blocked by the colonial minister in Paris, he argued that they were a threat to the Senegalese Imamate of Futa Toro (then a French client state) with which the British were poised to interfere. The Ministry gave in and on 7 July 1878, a French force destroyed the Kaarta Toucouleur fort at Sabouciré, killing their leader, Almany Niamody. This portion of the Kaarta vassals was then incorporated into the Khasso protectorate kingdom.A. S. Kanya-Forstner, The Conquest of the Western Sudan.

For example, Chisholm 1911 and Stephen 1887 give 4 July, yet Jackson 1908, Hook 1847 and Cunningham 1837 have 4 August, and McClintock 1868 has 13 August. The conclusive proof is from Owen 1784, 216, who reproduces \\"an exact copy\\" of the burial inscription given him by the vicar of the parish, which reads \\"Aug. iv.\\" (= 4 August). was an English divine and patristic scholar. Life Cave was born at Pickwell, Leicestershire, of which parish his father, John Cave was vicar. He was educated at Oakham School and St John's College, Cambridge. He took his B.A. degree in 1656, his M.A. in 1660, his DD in 1672, and in 1681 he was incorporated DD at Oxford. He was vicar of St Mary's, Islington (1662–91), rector of All-Hallows the Great, Upper Thames Street, London (1679–89), and in 1690 became vicar of Isleworth in Middlesex, at that time a quiet place which suited his studious temper. Cave was also chaplain to Charles II, and in 1684 became a canon of Windsor, where he died. He was buried at St Mary's, Islington, near his wife and children.The details of his burial are from Stephen 1887, 341; cf. Cunningham 1837, 344. Works Apostolici, 2d ed. (1682) The merits of Cave as a writer consist in the thoroughness of his research, the clearness of his style, and, above all, the admirably lucid method of his arrangement.Stephen 1887, 342. The two works on which his reputation principally rests are the Apostolici; or, The History of the Lives, Acts, Death and Martyrdoms of those who were contemporary with, or immediately succeeded the Apostles (1677), and Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Historia Literaria (1688). Dowling says that the works of Cave \\"rank undoubtedly among those which have affected the progress of Church-history. His smaller works greatly tended to extend an acquaintance with Christian Antiquity; his Lives of the Apostles and Primitive Fathers, which may be regarded as an Ecclesiastical history of the first four centuries, is to this very day [i.e. 1838] the most learned work of the kind which has been written in our own language; and his Historia Literaria is still the best and most convenient complete work on the literary history of the Church.\\"Dowling 1838, 159–60. Though he is sometimes criticised for not being critical with his sources, that failing means that many of his works, particularly Antiquitates Apostolicae and Apostolici contain a wealth of legendary material, culled from a wide variety of sources, much of which is not readily available elsewhere.The more critical judgments are found in McClintock 1868 and Dowling 1838, 160. Jean Le Clerc (1657–1736) During the course of his work he was drawn into controversy with Jean Le Clerc (1657–1736), who was then writing his Bibliothèque universelle et historique. Cave published a dissertation De Eusebii Caesariensis Arianismo adversus Johannem Clericum, criticising Le Clerc's treatment of Eusebius as an Arian, as the last of three dissertations appended to the second part of his Historia Literaria (London 1698). Le Clerc replied in a work entitled Epistolae Criticae et Ecclesiasticae, which formed the third volume of the second edition of his Ars Critica (Amsterdam, 1700); reprinted (Leiden, 1778). Le Clerc said, that Cave, in his Historia Literaria, had concealed many things about the fathers, for the sake of enhancing their credit, which an impartial historian should have related; and that, instead of lives of the fathers, he often wrote panegyrics upon them.Chalmers 1813; cf. Stephen 1887, 342. Cave responded the same year with his Epistola Apologetica (London, 1700). This was reprinted at the end of the second volume of the Historia Literaria, in the edition published at Oxford in 1743. Cave is said to have been \\"of a learned and communicative conversation;\\" he is also reported to have been \\"a florid and eloquent preacher,\\" and the printed sermons he has left behind bear out this character.The opinion of John Henry Overton, in Overton 1887, 342. *Primitive Christianity: or, the Religion of the ancient Christians in the first Ages of the Gospel, 2 volumes, 1672.

He made alterations and additions equal to one-third of the whole work, and wrote new prolegomena. It was finally printed in two folio volumes, with some additional matter from Henry Wharton, edited by Daniel Waterland, the first (Oxford, 1740), the second (Oxford, 1743).

Biography Edward H. Thompson was born in Worcester, Massachusetts. Thompson devoted much of his career to study of the Maya civilization. In 1879, Popular Science Monthly published \\"Atlantis Not a Myth\\", an article by Thompson in which he argued that the indigenous civilizations of North and Central America could be remnants of the lost continent of AtlantisEdward H. Thompson, \\"\\", Popular Science Monthly, October 1879. The article attracted the attention of Stephen Salisbury III, a wealthy Worcester resident,Mayanist, and principal benefactor of the American Antiquarian Society. Salisbury, along with fellow AAS members The Rev. Edward Everett Hale and Massachusetts Senator George Frisbie Hoar, persuaded Thompson to move to Yucatán to explore the Maya ruins in exchange for receiving an appointment as American Consul. Thompson arrived in Mérida, Yucatán, in 1885 and lived there for thirty years. Although he spoke only English upon his arrival, he learned Spanish and also became fluent in the Yucatec Maya language. Thompson did early examinations and excavations of several sites in the Maya Puuc region, including Loltun and Labná; at the latter site publishing a monograph on the Maya underground storage containers known as chultunes. He also became the first explorer to find and excavate a small site he called X'Kichmook. He made a series of plaster casts of Maya sculptures and architecture, particularly from Uxmal and Labná, which were exhibited at the World Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois in 1893. With the help of Alison Armour, Thompson in 1894 purchased the plantation that included the site of Chichen Itza. He rebuilt the hacienda, which had been destroyed in the Caste War of Yucatán. For 30 years he explored the site, on behalf of the Field Columbian Museum, the American Antiquarian Society, the Peabody Museum at Harvard University and others. His discoveries included the earliest dated carving upon a lintel in the Temple of the Initial Series and the excavation of several graves in the Ossario (High Priest’s Temple). Thompson is most famous for dredging the Cenote Sagrado (Sacred Cenote) from 1904 to 1911, where he recovered artifacts of gold, copper and carved jade, as well as the first-ever examples of what were believed to be pre-Columbian Maya cloth and wooden weapons. Thompson shipped the bulk of the artifacts to the Peabody Museum. In 1926, the Mexican government seized Thompson's plantation, charging he had removed the artifacts illegally. The Mexican Supreme Court in 1944 ruled in Thompson's favor. Thompson, however, had died in Plainfield, New Jersey in 1935, so the Hacienda Chichen reverted to his heirs.

He was born at Huddersfield, and christened in the Independent, dissenter's chapel at Highfield, his parents moving shortly afterwards to Leeds where he was educated. Henry Venn was vicar of Huddersfield parish until 1771. Hick's aptitude for mechanics and passion for drawing led to an apprentiship in 1804 (age 14) as a draughtsman with Fenton, Murray and Wood at the Round Foundry in Holbeck. The company made steam engines, textile and other machinery; here he was entrusted with the installation of several large steam engines and offered a partnership when his apprenticeship expired. The offer was declined and Hick moved instead to Bolton in 1810 to work for Smalley, Thwaites and Company as manager of Rothwell's Union Foundry on Blackhorse Street. His brother John Hick also trained as an engineer, in 1808 John left Fenton, Murray & Wood to take up the position of \\"book-keeper and traveller\\" for John Sturges and Co. at the Bowling Iron Works near Bradford.Chrimes In July 1820 Hick joined other leading industrialists Isaac Dobson, Thomas Hardcastle and Peter Rothwell together with engineer Joshua Routledge to form the Bolton Gaslight and Coke Company, providing gas for public buildings, street lamps and industrial lighting. With the inevitable fire risk of naked flame, the Great Bolton Trustees and a number of mill owners bought horse-drawn fire engines; Hick became a Trustee of Great Bolton during the early 1820s, he was an Anglican and prominent member of Bolton's Pitt Club, formed 1809 as a \\"political organisation composed of the admirers of William Pitt\\", that helped Hick move amongst the middle class social elite of the time. The Dobsons (Isaac and Benjamin), Hick, Rothwell, John Kennedy and others were members of a \\"prosecution\\" club (formed 1801), meeting at the Black Horse pub in Bolton, that in 1824 secured an annuity for the inventor and fellow member Samuel Crompton, who also frequented the Inn. Hick joined the Institution of Civil Engineers in the same year, proposed by Joshua Field, Joseph Farey and James Jones. Also with Rothwell and the Dobsons, Hick was a prominent member of the Black Horse Club, that met \\"to discuss not only business matters but the most interesting topics affecting that period\\". Together with many other leading figures from the Bolton area, including those from the Black Horse Club, Hick was a promoter and with Peter Rothwell an original shareholder of the Bolton and Leigh Railway that opened 1 August 1828 with the naming of the locomotive Lancashire Witch by Mrs Hulton, wife of the vilified William Hulton JP, High Sheriff of Lancashire and collier. Robert Stephenson was driver of the engine he designed and built with chief engineer George Stephenson, who was a passenger with the other guests. Following the occasion that gathered crowds of 40–50 thousand people, in October 1828, Hick and Rothwell received Robert Peel, then home secretary, as a guest at their foundry. In 1837 Hick was, among other local figures including Thomas Ridgway (1778–1839), Edward Bolling, John Hargreaves elder (1780–1860) and Jr, a member of the Provisional Committee of the Bolton and Preston Railway. By 1841 Hick was Deputy chairman and a Director with chairman John Hargreaves; the two families (Hick and Hargreaves) were linked by marriage in 1836. Chief engineer was John Urpeth Rastrick and resident engineer Alexander James Adie, son of Alexander Adie inventor of the sympiesometer. The line opened 22 June 1843 after Hick's death, following some problems in its construction, and merged with the North Union Railway Company 10 May 1844. Hick's executorial trustee, solicitor and banker Thomas Lever Rushton (1810–1883), by then a director of the railway, was part of the negotiating committee for the merger. According to the records of Charles Beyer and an appraisal by John Farey, Hick was apparently responsible for pioneering the use of high-pressure and compound steam engines in textile mills, following the designs of Arthur Woolf. Hick's engines should probably be considered best practice for the time c.1841. Locomotives built by Hick were of the best quality, Edward Bury considered them \\"extremely well made\\" and they were used by the London and Birmingham Railway for the very first scheme of standardisation of parts. Rothwell, Hick and Rothwell \\"Steam-Engine Manufactory and Iron-Works, Bolton. To Messrs. Rothwell, Hick & Co. This plate is respectfully inscribed by the publishers.

Originally published in William Henry Pyne's partwork Lancashire Illustrated, from Original Drawings (1828–1831). By 1821 Hick was managing partner of the Union Foundry, that later became Rothwell, Hick and Rothwell; the company listed in Baines' directory as supplying steam engines, hydraulic presses, weighing machines, gas light apparatus, mill machinery, sugar mills and constructors of fire proof buildings. After Peter Rothwell's death 2 August 1824, the firm continued with Peter Rothwell Jr (1792–1849) as Rothwell, Hick & Co.Marshall They made stationary steam engines, (a number of which were featured by John Farey in the second volume of his Treatise on the Steam Engine, 1827) as well as general engineering products including cast iron dockyard cranes. In 1824 when the prodigious and forward looking Swiss engineer Johann Georg Bodmer (anglicised to John George Bodmer) developed his patterns and textile machinery near Bolton he made use of the Rothwell, Hick and Rothwell workshops. Here in the late 1820s with the co-operation of an Italian merchant, Philip Novelli and H. & E. Ashworth, (Henry (1794–1880) and Edmund (1800–1881) Ashworth), they began a project of advanced concept at Egerton Mill to include a spectacular waterwheel of 62 feet diameter by 12 feet wide and 110–140 horsepower, completed by Fairbairn and Lillie when Bodmer returned to Europe as a result of ill-health. To aid in the construction it is claimed that Bodmer devised the travelling crane; the Egerton wheel became a tourist destination during the 1830s and 1840s, it was one of the largest in the United Kingdom attracting visits from industrialists and politicians. Benjamin Disraeli was a visitor to the Ashworth mills in 1843. By the 1830s Hick had become a highly valued friend of Bodmer, on one occasion arbitrating a patent dispute. Technical drawing of a balance and low pressure steam engine by Rothwell, Hick and Rothwell with architectural details in the Doric order. Traité Théorique et pratique des moteurs a vapeur, Jacques-Eugène Armengaud 1862. Hick also formed a close friendship with engineer and artist James Nasmyth, in his autobiography Nasmyth refers to Hick as a \\"most admirable man... whose judgment in all matters connected with engineering and mechanical construction was held in the very highest regard... ingenious\\", he \\"contrived and constructed... one of the most powerful hydraulic presses\\" in existence. Hick was inventor of the self tightening collar, used universally in hydraulic pressess. According to Nasmyth, Hick and William Fairbairn were among the most \\"intelligent and cultivated persons in Lancashire\\". Hick was an accomplished draughtsman and it is stated that he introduced almost a new era of elegance and design for the exterior forms of steam engines and larger works. Hick and Rothwell built their first locomotive Union in 1830 for the Bolton and Leigh Railway, they also built Pioneer for the Petersburg Railroad in America and a 2-2-0, the Pontchartrain for the Pontchartrain Railroad, New Orleans in 1832. Architecture and public works Hick's talent and reputation as a draughtsman lead to requests for his design of public buildings in Bolton: the Dispensary (1825), Nelson Square (demolished); Cloth Hall, Market Street (demolished); Gas Works (demolished), Water Works and possibly the old Town Hall (1826) in Little Bolton. The old Town Hall on All Saints Street, and Waterworks cottage (1824), Belmont remain today. The Dispensary is referred to in Pevsner's South Lancashire: The Industrial and Commercial South. Thomas Allen's, Lancashire Illustrated, from Original Drawings. considers, \\"The gas and waterworks also are eminently deserving of notice. Bolton will long retain memorials of its numerous obligations to the superior genius, public exertions and enterprising spirit of Mr. Benjamin Hick\\". Hick designed a Gas Pillar and presented it for the opening of Bolton's New Market Place (1826), claimed to be the finest uncovered market in the country; about November 1859 his son John Hick gifted a circular \\"cattle fountain\\" round the base, both gaslight and trough remained a feature of the square until 1925, the pillar described in 1825 as \\"a piece of elegant and classical workmanship\\" and \\"justly the admiration of persons of taste\\". Rothwell, Hick and Rothwell contributed elaborate iron work screens with anthemion patterns to Preston Corn exchange (1822–24). Hick designed a heating system for Richard Lane's The Oaks (demolished), an imposing Ionic villa conceived in 1838, and home of Quaker, Henry Ashworth. Hick's grandson, also Benjamin Hick (1845–1882) was architect of changes made to Lane's Exchange and Library (1825–29), New Market Place (renamed Victoria Square in 1897) about 1871, his grandfather was among the 80 shareholders of all political and religious persuasions. B. Hick and Sons In 1814 Benjamin Hick married Elizabeth Routledge (1783–1826) sister of his companion, Joshua Routledge (1773–1829), an engineer and ironmonger living in Bolton, and former manager for Fenton, Murray and Wood. Hick's father-in-law, William Routledge, was a blacksmith and Wesleyan lay minister at Elvington, a village about 8 miles south-east of York in Yorkshire. Joshua Routledge's sons were also engineers; William (1812–1882), a driver of the locomotive Phoenix at the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway 1828, in 1852 master engineer at New Bridge Brass Foundry and partner in Routledge & Ommanney, Salford. Henry (1817–1884), manager of Bolton brass founders J. and W. Kirkham in 1882. Benjamin Hick had five children, two sons John (1815–1894) and Benjamin (1818–1845) who he trained as engineers; on 10 April 1833 they set up their own manufactory, B. Hick and Sons, at the Soho Foundry, Crook Street, Bolton. The firm built the locomotive Soho bought by carrier John Hargreaves with six first class carriages for the Bolton and Leigh Railway, and soon became well known as suppliers to British and foreign railway companies. Three years later Hick's first child and eldest daughter Mary (1813–1878) married John Hargreaves Jr (1800–1874), manufacturer and operator of the Bolton & Leigh and Leigh & Kenyon Junction railways. After Elizabeth's death he married Hannah Elizabeth Goodyer (c.1791–1862) in 1827 at St Mary's church, Lambeth. Hannah was a daughter of Landon Goodyer who held a position of responsibility in a Fire Office, and sister of Frederick Goodyer who was to become a highly regarded Metropolitan Police Officer under Home Secretary, Robert Peel. The first daughter by Hick's second wife married the only son of Johann Georg Bodmer, his youngest daughter married the fourth son of James Bodmer. Hick was also linked by his mother-in-law Hannah Goodyer, née Schwenck, to the Naval surgeon and novelist William Gilbert, father of William Schwenck Gilbert of Gilbert and Sullivan, his first daughter from his marriage to Hannah Goodyer was named in a similar fashion; Helen Schwenck Hick. Hannah Goodyer's father John Adam Schwenck was treasurer of the congregation of St Mary le Strand, formerly partner in Bourdorff and Schwenck, sugar refiners on Millbank Street, in the parish of St. John the Evangelist, Westminster and a director of the Phoenix Fire Office. Patron of the arts Benjamin Hick was both a serious collector and patron of the arts alongside other wealthy industrialists and bankers from the North of England in the mid-nineteenth century, including Samuel Ashton, William Bashall of Bashall & Boardman, John Chapman, Henry Cooke, Benjamin Dobson, Sir John Gladstone, John Miller, Thomas Miller Jr of Preston, John Naylor of Leyland & Bullins and Peter Rothwell who favoured English art particularly that depicting nature and history. A man of \\"acknowledged taste and judgment\\"; Hick's private collection built over a period of 30 years \\"valuable, well known and much admired\\", comprised works of the Italian, Flemish, Dutch and British Masters. He was regarded as \\"one of the most liberal of the provincial patrons of Art\\", generous in his support of the British school, in particular a friend of Henry Liverseege who painted several works for Hick, and \\"on terms of intimacy\\" with many artists.

Having the \\"greatest reverence for Works of Art and Books\\", Hick's intention was to establish a Public Picture Gallery in Bolton, with \\"the conviction that such Works of Art would tend to greatly improve the taste and cultivate the better feeling of the rising generation\\". He obtained designs for the project, but did not live to see them through. As a boy he looked forward to becoming an Artist.

Hick and Son continued under the management of his eldest son, John Hick. Art works from Benjamin Hick's collection were advertised in January and February 1843 editions of The Art- Union, Athenaeum and Literary Gazette, then auctioned by Thomas Winstanley & Sons of Liverpool at the Exchange Gallery in Manchester between 21 and 24 February 1843. The sale included John Martin's pair Pandæmonium and The Celestial City and the River of Bliss. Both paintings were bought by Hick from the artist following their exhibition at the Royal Academy of Arts in 1841; Pandæmonium and its frame designed by Martin can be seen at the Louvre. Hick's obituary in the Art-Union appeared with those of John Varley, Lady Callcott and John Berney Crome. Details of the sale were published in the April edition of The Art-Union and May edition of The Gentleman's Magazine. Friends of Hick from Lancashire: Robert Barlow, Joseph Beckton, Robert Daglish Jr., Jonathan Hardcastle, John Moore, John Mawdsley, Peter Rothwell and Thomas Lever Rushton formed a committee to see through the production of an engraving from Hick's portrait by George Patten. The picture was entrusted to John Grundy and Henry Cousins undertook the work in mezzotint; proofs were then published at a moderate price, examples can be found today in various museum collections. Hick was well respected, despite his family's wish the funeral be \\"strictly private\\", more than 500 people \\"including a great number of influential gentlemen of the neighbourhood\\", attended his grave; employees of B. Hick & Son gathered nearly £200 for a memorial and despite offers of assistance \\"resolved unanimously to keep this honour for themselves\\". Benjamin Hick's memorial in Bolton Parish Church reads: > This monument is erected by a general subscription of his Workmen, in > remembrance of his Christian character and to record virtues so rare, for > future imitation; that he, though dead, may live again in the spirit, > action, and conduct of those, who, guided by his character, and stimulated > by his example, will learn to love their neighbour as themselves and to do > good to all men. He was an affectionate husband, a kind father, and a > sincere friend; alike distinguished by eminent ability, and uniform > integrity; genius, in whatever art or science displayed, even found in him a > liberal patron; He was benefactor to this town, where his worth will be long > appreciated; and his loss deeply deplored.

The line is the highest preserved standard-gauge line in the United Kingdom, and also uniquely having the only standard-gauge rail-over-rail bridge within preservation.  History of the line  The line from Brynmawr to Blaenavon was originally built under an Act of 1866 by the Brynmawr and Blaenavon Railway and immediately leased to the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) to transport coal to the Midlands via the Heads of the Valleys line. The line was completed in 1869 and the LNWR commenced operating passenger trains over the line the following year (1870). Eight years later it was extended to meet the Great Western Railway (GWR) at Abersychan & Talywain. Here the line carried on down the valley through Pontypool Crane Street Station to the coast at Newport. In 1922, the LNWR was grouped into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. In later years the line saw a variety of GWR locomotives operating from pit to port, however the railway retained its LNWR infrastructure up until the very last days before its closure. =Coal traffic= From the turn of the century the line served mining activity centred on several pits and collieries between Brynmawr and Waunafon. The first of these was the Waun Nantyglo colliery, which was situated a little east of a tramway which later carried the B4248 Brynmawr to Blaenavon Road. The connection was removed by 1925. As Waunafon was approached on a facing branch to the left was built, leading to Clydach colliery, but these had gone by 1915, to be replaced by New Clydach Colliery sidings. Vestiges of these remained until 1950. Some south of Waunafon station a branch, built in 1870, veered to the West to serve the Milfraen Colliery. The space between the single-platform station at Waunafon and the branch was occupied by a series of loops and sidings. In 1913 a small platform, called Garn-yr-Erw halt was built just north of the Whistle Road Bridge. This halt had no timetable for passengers as it was used only by miners. =Closures= By 1938 Milfraen Pit had ceased production having exhausted its own coal reserves, the branchline that served it was removed in 1937. The line was closed to passengers, not during the Beeching Cuts which befell the GWR route to Blaenavon Low Level, but in 1941 due to the exigencies of the Second World War. Blaenavon shed closed in 1942 and eventually goods also ceased in 1954. The line was retained for wagon storage until 1953, and around 1950, a temporary siding was laid in connection with opencast workings on the Blorenge, branching east roughly at the point where the Milfraen Colliery branch had previously branched west. The declining situation continued through the 1950s, then Varteg Hill subsequently closed in 1964, leaving Big Pit as the primary exporter of coal left. The once double track to Pontypool was then singled in June 1965. Although passenger and goods traffic had long ceased to Brynmawr the track was re-laid by the NCB to just south of Waunafon station again during the 1970s for the Black Lion Disposal Point washery. Although the track along the whole route to Brynmawr was finally lifted in July 1961, the section from Blaenavon to Pontypool was still in use for coal trains from other local mines until Big Pit finally closed in 1980. The line from Cwmbran was dismantled right up to outside Blaenavon High Level station whilst the washery and other colliery buildings were demolished during 1987. Much of the railway today has now become part of the National Cycle Network Route 46.  Visitor attraction  The railway between Furnace Sidings and was opened to visitors in 1983. It runs every weekend between spring and September. There is also a selection of special weekends through the spring and summer, daily (with the exceptions of Monday and Fridays) in August, as well as Santa Specials nearing Christmas. The railway did not increase its length of track for a quarter century after its opening, but increased as a going concern, with a larger number of volunteers, a larger amount of operational rolling stock, and more definite plans for the railway's future.  Expansion of the P&BR;  The new building at Blaenavon Furnace Sidings railway station Andrew Barclay 0-4-0ST 'Rosyth' at Big Pit Halt Hunslet 18 Inch 0-6-0ST Eastmoor Steelworks No. 18 'Jessie' runs round the train at Blaenavon Furnace Sidings In May 2010 the railway was extended a distance of roughly southwards to the site of the former Blaenavon High Level station (once the London and North Western Railway's station in the town). The Pontypool Blaenavon Railway Company was granted an Order under the Transport and Works Act to extend and operate the line. Work, which started in late 2004, was initially complicated by difficulty in determining who built the railway. The order allowing most of the initial construction was the Brynmawr and Blaenavon Act of 1866, but a short section in the south was built under the LNWR (Wales &c;) Act of 1875. Once the two months spent on this research was complete matters progressed rapidly so that a formal application to the Welsh Assembly was made on 3 May 2005. By the end of June 2005 the application became public with a two-month subsequent period allowed for formal objection. By 28 November 2005, the inspector appointed by the National Assembly for Wales, Stuart B Wild, MRTPI, MCMI made his report to Parliament. Subsequently, a full meeting of the planning Decision Committee of the National Assembly for Wales, chaired by Carwyn Jones, Minister for Environment, Planning and Countryside, approved the application on 24 January 2006. The minister in turn wrote to Winckworth Sherwood on 31 January. The Order, called the Pontypool and Blaenavon (Phase 1) Order 2006 was finally made on 20 June 2006 and came into force on 21 June 2006. The route southwards was made difficult by the need to refurbish a number of bridges en route. A substantial report issued by the Company to Torfaen County Borough Council, the successor to the Welsh Development Agency, and other interested parties, estimated the lowest cost for the extension and the provision of a minimal station at High Level at between £235K and £395K, with cost of the bridges lying between £162K and £323K—by far the dominant item in the total cost. The Company eventually achieved funding from the Welsh Assembly Government's Heads of the Valleys programme to meet much of the refurbishment costs. Blaenavon (High Level) station is close to the centre of Blaenavon town centre, and as a result, a substantial increase in passenger numbers is confidently expected. Blaenavon is the centre of the World Heritage Site of the Blaenavon Industrial Landscape, which includes Big Pit National Coal Museum and Blaenavon Ironworks. The presence of the railway there is expected to significantly add to the visitor experience and tourist potential of the town. With Phase 1 achieved, the railway constructed a branch line into the National Mining Museum in 2011 before turning towards extending the line northwards, under a small road bridge and along the still intact track bed to Waunafon, the summit of the line which at above sea level was the highest standard-gauge station in both England and Wales. There is also growing political interest for the preserved line to extend further again to Brynmawr which takes the railway over the local authority boundary from Torfaen into Blaenau Gwent and also the historic county boundary from Monmouthshire into Brecknockshire. However the emphasis with the local authority is that this phase will serve as a community link, rather than a tourist attraction.  Future expansion  With extensions southwards to Varteg and beyond, it has been found that the deck of Varteg Road bridge was beyond economical repair, and could not simply be refurbished as was the case with the other bridges on the line. The local authority replaced the deck with two new bridges, one for the railway, and the other for the cycleway in April 2011. Presently it is currently impossible to advance more than about before coming into conflict with the cycleway. Torfaen County Borough Council has recognised the railway's potential to expand towards Talywain and have included this within their local development plan. This will also allow for route sharing to accommodate both Cycle Route and future line proposals whilst ensuring measures are taken to minimise any conflict occurring in dual operation. Southward expansions to Wainfelin may be jeopardised by recent land reclamation schemes presented by Spring UR Ltd. These plans require the swift destruction of the prominent Big Arch, a brick-lined tunnel structure built in 1879 and already a Grade II listed structure. The plans opt for its demolition in order to breach the disused railway embankment, this would create a wider access route for heavy road traffic for open-casting west of Talywain village to commence. Not only would this prevent future line extensions but impede the Celtic Trail cycle path altogether as well. Whether a more beneficial plan for the surrounding area, or alternative put forward by the Torfaen Council, is currently unknown as these proposals are still in the early stages of public meetings. After Pontypool (Wainfelin), any further restoration of the original route down the valley is now virtually impossible as the line through Pontypool to Newport via Clarence Street was lost in the 1980s to the construction of the A4043 bypass. Retail development such as Tesco now occupies the site of Pontypool Crane Street station, however, the preservation society managed to rescue this up-platform station building by painstakingly deconstructing brick-by-brick and stored onsite for eventual re-construction. As of January 2014, the stonework has been used to decorate the new station building at Furnace Sidings.

The book was in use by the Notre-Dame school composers working in Paris around the end of the 12th and beginning of the 13th centuries. It is known from references to a \\"magnum volumen\\" by Johannes de Garlandia and to a \\"Magnus liber organi de graduali et antiphonario pro servitio divino\\" by the English music theorist known simply as Anonymous IV. Today it is known only from later manuscripts containing compositions named in Anonymous IV's description.  History  Although little is known of the provenance of the Magnus liber organi, it is considered most likely to have originated in Paris, and is known today by only a few surviving manuscripts and fragments, although there are records of at least seventeen lost versions.. The Liber is supposed to have been created by Léonin (1135–c.1200) and revised by Pérotin (fl. 1200) and contained compositions attributed to each. Today its contents can be inferred from the 3 surviving major manuscripts. The most complete is commonly known as F (I-Fl Pluteo 29.1, Biblioteca Medicea-Laurenziana, Florence), which first appeared in the library of Piero de' Medici by 1456. Of the two others, referred to as W1 & W2 (Wolfenbüttel Cod. Guelf. Helmst. 677 & 1099), both in the Herzog August Bibliothek (Ducal Library), the first is thought to have originated in the cathedral priory of St Andrews, Scotland. The Ma fragment (Madrid 20486) is, believed to be originally from Toledo. Catalogues referring to other lost copies attest to the wide diffusion through Western Europe of the repertoire later called ars antiqua. Between all the sources, some 100 different chants in two-part settings can be found. The music from the Liber has been published in modern times by William Waite (1954), Hans Tischler (1989) and by Edward Roesner (1993–2009).  Music at Notre-Dame  alt=Illustration from the Magnus liber organi The early music repertoire of repertory of Notre Dame cathedral represents one of the highlights of Western culture, coinciding with the architectural innovation that produced the structure itself, from the beginning of its construction in 1163. A handful of surviving manuscripts demonstrate the evolution of polyphonic elaboration of the liturgical plainchant that was used at the cathedral every day throughout the year. While the concept of combining voices in harmony to enrich plainsong chant, was not new, there lacked the musical theory to enable the rational construction of such pieces. The innovations at Notre Dame consisted of patterns of short and long musical notes and the system of musical notation for directing the duration of the notes in writing. This is attributed to Léonin, who is considered to have been a distinguished poet, scholar, musician and cathedral administrator. The Magnus Liber represents a step in the evolution of Western music between plainchant and the intricate polyphony of the later 13th and 14th centuries (see Machaut and Ars Nova). The music of the Magnus Liber displays a connection to the emerging Gothic style of architecture; just as ornate cathedrals were built to house holy relics, organa were written to elaborate Gregorian chant, which too was considered holy. One voice sang the notes of the Gregorian chant elongated to enormous length (called the tenor, which comes from the Latin for \\"to hold\\"); this voice, known as the vox principalis, held the chant, although the words were obscured by the length of notes. One, two, or three voices, known as the vox organalis (or vinnola vox, the \\"vining voice\\") were notated above it with quicker lines moving and weaving together. The evolution from a single line of music to one where multiple lines all had the same weight moved through the writing of organa. The practice of keeping a slow moving \\"tenor\\" line continued into secular music, and the words of the original chant survived in some cases, as well. One of the most common types of organa in the Magnus Liber is the clausula, which are sections of polyphony that can be substituted into longer organa. The extant manuscripts provide a number of notational challenges to modern practice, since they contain only the polyphonic elements, from which the chant has to be inferred. The music of the Magnus Liber was used in the liturgy of the church throughout the feasts of the church year. The text contains only the polyphonic lines and the notation is not exact, as barlines were still several centuries from invention. The chant was added to the notated music, and it was up to the performers to fit the disparate lines together into a coherent whole. But the fact that the music was even written down is a fairly new development in the history of Western music.

He came to Mexico as a refugee from Russia together with his father, writer Victor Serge. Attracted to painting from his exposure in Europe, Vlady quickly became part of Mexico's artistic and intellectual scene, with his first individual exhibition in 1945, two years after his arrival to the country. Vlady spent most of his career in Mexico with trips back to Europe, gaining fame in the 1960s. In the 1970s, he was invited to paint murals at the Miguel Lerdo de Tejada Library, a 17th-century building in the historic center of Mexico City. The result was Las revoluciones y los elementos\\" dedicated to the various modern revolutions in the world including the sexual revolution of the mid 20th century. The work was somewhat controversial but it led to other mural work in Nicaragua and Culiacán. Vlady received a number of awards for his life's work including honorary membership with the Russian Academy of Arts. A number of years before his death in 2005, the artist donated 4,600 artworks from his own collection, about a thousand of which are found at the Centro Vlady at the Universidad Autónoma de la Ciudad de México, which is dedicated to research and promotion of the artist's work. Life Vlady was born on June 14, 1920 in Saint Petersburg, Russia (then called Petrograd), during the Russian Revolution. He was the son of writer and photographer Victor Napoleon Lvovich Kibalchich, better known as Victor Serge, and Liuba Rusakova. Serge was secretary to Leon Trotsky . When Stalin took over the Soviet Union, his family was exiled to Kazakhstan, where the family lived in extreme poverty. In 1933, his mother succumbed to mental illness due to the stress of their situation and was committed to the psychiatric clinic of the Red Army. Vlady accompanied his father to the gulag. His schooling at this time was from Bolshevik professors allied with Lenin deported by Stalin . Due to pressure from writers and intellectuals such as André Malraux, the family was allowed to leave the Soviet Union in 1936. They lived for a few months in Belgium before moving to France. At this time, Vlady became militantly in favor of the Republicans during the Spanish Civil War, he did not go and join the war because of his age. His time in Belgium and France gave him his first experience with modern art, which inspired him to become a painter. In Paris, Vlady began to study in the workshops of various painters there such as Victor Brauner, Wifredo Lam, Joseph Lacasse, André Masson and Aristide Maillol. He continued to do so until 1941, when the imminent German invasion of France forced the family to move again as refugees. The family went to Marseilles to board a boat to leave Europe but Vlady's mother needed to be hospitalized again. When Vlady and his father left for Martinique, they had to leave the mother in a hospital in Aix-en-Provence where she remained until her death in 1943. From Martinique, the father and son went to the Dominican Republic. They were initially attracted by the climate and people of the country. His father began to write again but was concerned about Vlady's lack of Spanish and proclivity to hang around with other refugees in bars. Their visa to live in Mexico was approved with help from then ex-president Lázaro Cárdenas, and they left for the Yucatan peninsula after a short stay in Cuba . They arrived to Mexico in 1943, when Vlady was twenty one years old. After landing in the Yucatan, they soon moved to Mexico City . Although Vlady and his father quickly integrated into the artistic and intellectual circles of the country, their economic situation was precarious. Vlady worked hard to get his first artistic exhibition in 1945, but his father died days afterwards. That same year, Vlady married Mexican Isabel Díaz Fabela and two years after that, became a naturalized Mexican citizen. Vlady developed his artistic career in Mexico but kept frequent contact with Europe. His first visit back to the continent was in 1950, as it was recovering from World War II, traveling to the Netherlands, Belgium, Yugoslavia, Spain, Italy, England and France, where he made a series of lithographs. From 1964 to 1965 he traveled in various countries again, as well as in 1969, when he visited Belgium, France and Portugal . In 1989, following the Gorbachev era, Kibalchich traveled to the Soviet Union to press for the rehabilitation of Trotsky and Serge. Vlady lived and worked in Mexico City until 1990, when he moved to Cuernavaca, to a country house with a large studio. He continued to live there with his wife and work until his death on July 21, 2005 from brain cancer. He left behind his wife Isabel who later died in 2010. Career=Painting and exhibitions= He was fascinated by the murals painted by Diego Rivera and José Clemente Orozco, trying at first to imitate them without success after his arrival. He then traveled around Mexico to learn more about his new country, sketching the people and the geography. He had his first individual exhibition at the Instituto Francés de América Latina in 1945, which began a career of individual and collective exhibitions of his work. This included the opening of a gallery called Galería Prisse in 1952 with Alberto Gironella and Enrique Echeverría. It was open for only a year but it was influential in establishing the Generación de la Ruptura. From 1951 to 1961 he participated in the Biennal of Paris (I and II), the Biennal of São Paulo, the IV Biennal of Tokyo and the Biennal of Córdoba, Argentina. Vlady's career gained momentum when he was in his forties. In 1966 he received a grant from the French embassy in Mexico to go to Paris and make lithographs. In 1967 he won a medal at the World Homage to Baccaccio in Certaldo, Italy. He was invited to participate in the Confrontación 66 and participated in Hemisferia 68 as well as the World's Fair in Osaka. In 1968 he received a Guggenheim Fellowship and spent a year in New York. Other important exhibitions were at the Santa Barbara Museum of Art, the Museo de Arte Moderno and the Woadington Gallery in Montreal, with his artwork also exhibited in Italy, Brazil and Argentina. Later in his career, the Palacio de Bellas Artes held a major retrospective of his work I 1986. In 1989 he had an exhibition at the Jardín Borda in Cuernavaca. In 2000, the Museo de Arte Moderno presented a retrospective of Vlady's work with 173 watercolors, sketches, engravings and lithographs. From 2000 to 2005, he work was shown in various exhibitions, primarily in Mexico and Russia including the José Luis Cuevas Museum and the Orenburg Museum in 2003 and Pushkin Museum in Moscow in 2005. =Murals and monumental pieces= In 1972 Mexican president Luis Echeverría invited him to paint murals. His most important mural project began in 1973 for the Biblioteca Miguel Lerdo de Tejada, a library located in a 17th-century church in the historic center of Mexico City. The project covers 2,000 square meters and took eight years to complete. The work is divided into various panels which unlike most Mexican mural work, does not limit itself to Mexican history but touches on various modern revolutions including the Russian, the French, the various American movements for independence and even the “Freudian Revolution” or sexual revolution of the mid 20th century. The overall work is called Las revoluciones y los elementos, and consists of panels entitled La tríade apacionada, La mano martirizante de la vieja fe rusa, la passion comunista and Una cabeza autosuficiente. Vlady first completed the section in the chapel, considered to be the most important panel and causing the area's renaming to the Sala Freudiana. The panels were finally inaugurated in 1982 by President José López Portillo . The library murals attracted visits from a number of notable people including Edgar Morin, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Jean- Pierre Chevenement, Michel Lequenne, Allen Ginsberg and Andrei Voznesensky . The murals remain in good condition with the library undergoing a number of restoration work in the 2000s to keep moisture and other damaging elements out of the interior. The library mural was somewhat controversial, but it also led to an invitation from the Nicaraguan government to paint murals at the Palacio Nacional de la Revolución in Managua in 1987 with Canadian-Mexican artist Arnold Belkin and at the Museo de Culiacán in 1993. In Culiacan, he painted fifty square meters of ceiling with a work called El ocaso y la alborada using a Venetian technique he admired for it use of pigments. In the 1990s Vlady painted several monumental canvases. In 1994, he completed a series of four pieces for the Secretaría de Gobernación called Luces y obscuridad, Violencias fraternas, Descendimiento y ascension and Huella del pasado. However, these works were disappeared shortly after their official presentation to the former Lecumberri prison when Vlady came out in support of the ongoing Zapatista rebellion in Chiapas . In 1995, he presented another monumental work, yet unfinished, to the bishop of Chiapas, Samuel Ruiz in support of the same movement. Called Tatic, it expresses sympathy to the Zapatistas and was completed entirely in 2000. =Recognitions= In the late 1960s, he became a member of the Salón de Independientes but left shortly before its demise in 1970. In 1971 he received the Premio Annual de Grabado at the Salón de la Plástica Mexicana of which he was a member. In 1998 the French government awarded him the title of Commandeur de l’Ordre des Arts et des letters. On February 9, 2004 the official inauguration of the Personal Room of the Honorary Member of the Russian Academy of Arts. In 2005 he received the Palacio de Bellas Artes Commemorative Medal from the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes . Artistry Vlady was a painter, muralist and printmaker, and a leader of the contemporary art movement in Mexico. His main influences were Mexican muralism and French surrealism, even though he rejected both schools of painting. While initially inspired by the Mexican muralists, Vlady did not like their nationalist and didactic elements. Despite being of the Muralists’ age, he identified with younger Mexican artists looking to break away, called the Generación de la Ruptura. Vlady experimented with abstract elements but still keep a number of figurative elements such as the rays of the sun, sand, waves, etc. It was a minimalist expression but never reached full abstractionism. While on a Guggenheim in New York in 1967 and 1968 he met artist Mark Rothko. Rothko's work troubled Vlady, and when he returned to Mexico he decided to return to figurative art. The most important canvas of this later work is the Trotsky Trilogy. There were some marks of expressionism in his mature way of painting, but his acknowledged model was definitely the Italian Renaissance. Vlady lived amidst Caravaggio, Tiziano and Artemisia Gentileschi as if they were his contemporaries. Flemish and Dutch painting was a source of inspiration as well, in particular Peter Paul Rubens and Rembrandt. Many of his themes were borrowed from classical painting but distorted, ground into multiple fragments and reinvented. Essentially while he agreed with the younger painters in new images and figures, he did not believe in discarding traditional methods and techniques. He work contains images of sensuality, eroticism and politics. It also includes eight self-portraits. This protracted acquaintance with classical painting induced Vlady to paint according to the strictest techniques of his masters, using natural products such as egg yolk and earth powders, and entirely rejecting what he called industrial painting. He painted using layers of oil and varnish in order to give depth to his painting and to make the light leap out of the canvas. This insistence on classical technique induced Vlady to reject most contemporary art that he believed had forgotten the principles of good painting. He enjoyed saying: \\"If Picasso or Francis Bacon (artist) could come through a time channel and come to Verrocchio's studio, or Rafael Sanzio's, they would not last a week, they would be kicked out as bad painters…\\" Centro Vlady In 2004, he donated most of his art collection, a total of 4,600 paintings, drawings and engravings to the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes. About 1,000 pieces are part of the Centro Vlady at the Universidad Autónoma de la Ciudad de México (UACM). The center's mission is to safeguard, do research and promote Vlady's life's work as well as that of his father Victor Serge. The center was inaugurated with his widow Isabel Díaz Fabela and his nephew Carlos Díaz in July 2005. The center has a permanent collection of 318 paintings, 245 engravings, lithographs and linoleum etchings, 63 oils and 376 drawings and watercolors. It is not exactly a museum although it does sponsor research, exhibition and promotion of the artist's work. There has been a dispute since 2011 between the descendants of Vlady and the school. The former claims that the college was not fulfilling its obligations.

He travelled extensively in India in the company of his uncle Thomas Daniell, with whom he collaborated on one of the finest illustrated works of the period – Oriental Scenery. He later travelled around the coastline of Britain to paint watercolours for the equally ambitious book A Voyage Round Great Britain. His work was exhibited at the Royal Academy and the British Institution and he became a Royal Academician in 1822.Biography.

(1810) The Burning of the Kent (c. 1825) Illustration from Interesting Selections from Animated Nature, 1809 William Daniell was born in Kingston upon Thames, Surrey. His father was a bricklayer and owner of a public house called The Swan in nearby Chertsey. Daniell's future was dramatically changed when he was sent to live with his uncle, the landscape artist Thomas Daniell (1749–1840) after his father's premature death in 1779. In 1784 William accompanied his uncle to India, who worked there on a series of prints, acting as his assistant in preparing drawings and sketches. William's brother Samuel Daniell remained independent of his uncle and also became a topographical artist; he went to South Africa in 1801 and after his return to England published African Scenery and Animals (1804–5), a collection of aquatints. From 1806 he lived in Ceylon. India Daniell was sixteen when he accompanied his uncle to India. On 17 July 1786, a few months after their arrival in Calcutta, Thomas Daniell placed an advertisement in the Calcutta Chronicle, announcing the forthcoming publication of a set of twelve views of the city.For details of the publication see This seemed a promising idea, since Calcutta was rapidly expanding and its European inhabitants might be willing to buy prints showing its latest buildings. Both he and William were inexperienced printmakers and had to enlist the help of Indian craftsmen, but the set, executed in aquatint, was completed in November 1788 and sold well. Thomas then began planning an ambitious tour of northern India, possibly inspired by the wealth of picturesque scenery indicated in William Hodges's collection of aquatints, Select Views in India (1785–8). In August 1789, Thomas and William set off up-river past Murshidabad to Bhagalpur, where they stayed with Samuel Davis (1760–1819), an employee of the East India Company and a skilled amateur artist. They continued on to Kanpur and then travelled overland to Delhi, visiting Agra, Fatehpur Sikri and Mathura on the way; the following April they made a pioneering tour to Srinagar, Uttarakhand and Garhwal in the Himalayas. Thomas and William Daniell were back in Calcutta at the end of 1791. They held a lottery of their completed work, using the proceeds to fund a tour to the South. Since the Third Mysore War was in progress, the Daniells suspected that a market existed among the British for oil paintings and drawings of the areas in which the conflict was taking place. They duly visited various hill-forts on their way south, as well as the huge and richly carved temples at Madurai, Mamallapuram and Rameswaram. Once back in Madras they held another lottery of their work and set off on a tour to western India. On their arrival in Bombay in March 1793 they met James Wales (1747–95), then busy drawing the area's cave temples. He took them to Elephanta, Karli and Kanheri among other places. Return to England In September 1794 the Daniells returned to England. Over the period 1784 to 1794 William had kept a detailed diary of their travels. This is now in the British Library. After 1794 he no longer kept a diary and so we have no information in his own hand about the rest of his life. The Royal Academician, Joseph Farington, himself a landscape painter and topographical draughtsman, kept a diary from 1793 until he died in 1821.Farington, Joseph.

John Garvey has gone through the diary and extracted glimpses of William's private life and of his artistic work.William Daniell's Isle of Skye & Raasay Garvey, John, Matador, UK, 2009. William Daniell's Inverness & the Moray Firth Garvey, John, Matador, UK, 2014. The diaries are almost the only written record we have of the life of William Daniell. In 1794, William and his uncle set up house at 37 Howland Street, Fitzroy Square. Their first priority was to publish a selection of their paintings of India. The views that were selected were made into aquatint prints, calling upon William's skills in this delicate medium. These skills were hard earned. Farington records in his diary that William had informed him that on his return to England he spent the next seven years working from six in the morning until midnight perfecting his aquatinting techniques. Financial success The Daniells' great work on India, Oriental Scenery, was published in six parts over the period 1795–1808.Oriental scenery (indoislamica.com) It comprised a total of 144 coloured aquatints and six uncoloured title-pages. The cost of a complete set was £210. The publication was a success, both artistically and financially. Thirty sets were sold to the East India Company, and a further order for eighteen copies was received. Thomas Sutton in his book The Daniells: Artists and Travellers (1954), quotes a glowing tribute to the work of the Daniells from the Calcutta Monthly magazine: > The execution of these drawings is indeed masterly; there is every reason to > confide in the fidelity of the representations; and the effect produced by > this rich and splendid display of oriental scenery is truly striking. In > looking at it, one may almost feel the warmth of an Indian sky, the water > seems to be in actual motion and the animals, trees and plants are studies > for the naturalist. Further different versions of Indian scenes were published, and details can be found in Sutton's book, together with a detailed inventory of all the artistic output of Thomas, Samuel and William Daniell.Sutton, Thomas, The Daniells: Artists and Travellers Bodley Head, London 1954 Oriental Scenery took its place among such revered works as J. Stuart and N. Revett's Antiquities of Athens (1762), Baron Denon's Voyage dans la basse et la haute Egypte (1802) and Robert Wood's Ruins of Palmyra (1753) and Ruins of Balbek (1757). It provided an entirely new vision of the Indian subcontinent that was to influence both decorative arts and British architectural design. Above all, it formed a popular vision in Britain of a romantic and picturesque India that to some extent persists. Daniell's years after 1804 included making 72 etchings after George Dance's highly finished pencil profile portraits of Regency London's artistic establishment. A Collection of Portraits were published over ten years from 1804.Roger Bowdler, \\"Dance, George, the younger (1741–1825)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 Many are now held by the National Portrait Gallery. For Rees's Cyclopædia he contributed drawings, but these have not been identified. A Voyage Round Great Britain In 1813 Daniell decided to undertake what was to be his greatest artistic work, A Voyage Round Great Britain. His plan was to journey around the whole coast and record views of places of interest. An integral part of the venture was to provide a running commentary, which described the scenery and the conditions of the people. Daniell had already had excursions in England, Wales and Scotland and so he had a good idea where to go and what he might find by way of subjects for paintings. The original intention was to make a coastal trip by sea, but it became clear early on in the venture that this was not practical, and most of the journey around the coast had to be made by road. The journey was completed in six separate trips, over the period 1813 to 1823. In the summer of 1813, Daniell and his companion, Richard Ayton, who was to write the accompanying text, covered the coast from Land's End to Holyhead. The following year in August they went from Holyhead to Kirkcudbright. Richard Ayton did not accompany Daniell on the rest of the journey, leaving Daniell to sketch the scenery and also write the text. Daniell's approach was to make pencil sketches of views that looked interesting, annotating them with details of colour and texture. The sketches included people and scenery. The transfer of the picture from paper to copper in the form of an aquatint plate required great artistic skill and dexterity. The process is very delicate. This was done on his return to London, as was the printing and colouring of the prints. Daniell must have had a very good visual memory of the places he had visited, as up to five years elapsed between the production of the sketches and the prints being completed. In 1815, Daniell set out in May and travelled north to Wigtown. It is likely that he took the Mail Coach, a journey of 4 to 5 days. On his way north he travelled via Edinburgh, and took advice from many people there on the places to visit on the coast up and around the north of Scotland. The novelist Walter Scott not only advised Daniell on the places to visit in Scotland, but also provided him with material for inclusion in the accompanying text. Friends in Edinburgh were able to give Daniell letters of introduction to people who were willing to provide hospitality to him on his journey. This was important, as the availability of hostelries was very limited and their quality dubious. During July and August 1815 Daniell journeyed around the islands of Eigg, Rùm, Skye and Raasay, together with the Hebridean Islands of Harris and Lewis. His trip continued up the west coast of Scotland, around the north coast, out to the Orkney Islands and down the east coast as far south as Dundee. He arrived in Dundee in October 1815. When setting out from London in May, he had not planned to cover so much of the coastline on one visit, but the weather in 1815 was exceptionally favourable, with good visibility and clear skies providing perfect conditions for an artist. This mammoth journey resulted in 139 aquatint prints being finally published, the last completed in 1821. In August 1821 Daniell once again journeyed north to St Andrews. During August and September he went around the coast as far as Southend, finding 28 subjects from which he produced prints. In the period July to September 1822, the journey as far as Torquay, along the popular south coast of England, resulted in a total of 52 published prints, and August and September 1823 brought Daniell back to Land's End, with a further 31 prints. The final prints of A Voyage Round Great Britain were published on 20 May 1825. A Voyage Round Great Britain was published by Longman in eight volumes over the period 1814 to 1825.Daniell, William. A Voyage Round Great Britain Longman. London 1818Ayton, Richard. A Voyage around Great Britain: Volume 1, Volume 2 (London: Tate Gallery, 1978).A Voyage around Great Britain (Editions Alecto).*A voyage round Great Britain (Dumfries and Galloway Council) The complete set of eight volumes was priced at £60. The final number of prints included was 308. Garvey's book follows Daniell around part of the voyage, the Hebridean islands of Eigg, Rum, Skye and Raasay, locating the viewpoints included in his aquatint prints. Over the period 1813 to 1825, in parallel with preparing the prints for the Voyage, Daniell was busy on other projects, which included paintings for the Academy Exhibitions. Many of the works exhibited were oil paintings of Scottish scenes. The artistic quality of the paintings and aquatints produced and published by Daniell for A Voyage Round Great Britain was considered to be very high. The atmospheric effects which he was able to convey in the aquatint medium were quite overwhelming. This was particularly true of his portrayal of ships and maritime scenery, as he had demonstrated in many earlier paintings and prints. In February 1822 after many years of endeavour, Daniell was finally elected an R.A. In the final ballot the voting was between John Constable and Daniell, the result being 11 to 17. William produced a number of marine paintings. One, The Burning of the \\"Kent\\" is in the Museum of the Queen's Royal Surrey's, having been rediscovered after having disappeared for over a hundred years. It is an illustration of the dramatic loss of the East Indiaman , and the rescue of some 550 survivors of her 650 crew and passengers. His shipping scenes, such A Bird's-Eye View of the East India Dock at Blackwell (National Maritime Museum, London), were supplemented by greatly admired battle pieces. In 1825, he won a prize of £100 for a pair of paintings depicting the Battle of Trafalgar, exhibited at the British Institution. Daniell turned to panorama painting before his death, beginning in 1832 with a painting of Madras, including a depiction of the Hindu mode of taming wild elephants. Daniell's last great artistic work was produced between 1827 and 1830. Over this time he became interested in the scenery around Windsor. In 1827, 1828 and 1830, he exhibited a total of five oil paintings of Windsor Castle and its surroundings and two oil paintings of Virginia Water, at the Royal Academy Exhibitions. These were considered to be among his finest oil paintings, and according to Sutton, his view of the Long Walk at Windsor was generally acknowledged to be his masterpiece in oils. Daniell produced a set of 12 aquatints of the Windsor and Virginia water views. Sutton writes of this series: > These twelve prints are the finest aquatints ever made, standing alone at > the highest possible peak: aquatint could go no further, and although > attempts have been made by others to excel them, none succeeded. The prints > were made in Daniell's usual way, engraved by himself from his own drawings, > and published by himself at 14, Russell Place, Fitzroy Square. By this time > he was a comparatively wealthy man, and one can imagine him lovingly and > carefully tinting the plates, leisurely savouring their subtle beauties, > unhampered by time or financial worry. We feel, in looking at these > aquatints, that perhaps Daniell, with the philosophy of a much-travelled > man, realised that in the cool greys and greens with which he \\"stained\\" his > prints was the charm of his own land, more enduring than the exotic mystery > of the Orient or the strange architecture of Hindistan. Daniell worked right up to his death, on 16 August 1837 at Brecknock Terrace, Camden Town (now 135 St Pancras Way). The house is marked by a commemorative plaque. He submitted five pictures to the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition in that year. The final twist in the story of A Voyage Round Great Britain, was the discovery, in 1962, of 306 of the original 308 Daniell copper plates, the location of which had not been known for more than 100 years. They are now the property of the Tate. It seems appropriate that of all the topographical books of the 19th century it should be copper plates for Daniell's Voyage Round Great Britain that have survived – they are a monument to his industry and his unsurpassed skill in handling the remarkable delicacy of the aquatint process. Published works Among his publications, engraved in aquatint, were: * Voyage to India * Zoography * Animated Nature * Views of London * Views of Bootan, a work prepared from his uncle's sketches * A Voyage Round Great Britain, which occupied him for several years. Collections Daniell is represented in the following collections, among others: National Portrait Gallery, London; Royal Academy of Arts, London; National Maritime Museum, London; Courtauld Institute of Art, London; Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco; National Museums and Galleries of Wales, Cardiff; Indianapolis Museum of Art, U.S.A.; Falmouth Art Gallery, Falmouth, UK; Dallas Museum of Art, Texas; Watford Museum, Watford, UK; National Museum of India, New Delhi.

It was the second notable U.S. railroad to file for abandonment in its entirety, the first being the New York, Ontario & Western Railway.kodtrak.railfan.net History=South Mountain and Boston and successors: 1873-1882= Around 1868, serious proposals for the crossing of the Hudson River at Poughkeepsie began to appear. A charter for the Poughkeepsie Bridge Company was obtained in 1871, and the company was organized before the end of May. The charter was amended to allow placing piers in the river by 1872 (despite fierce opposition from navigation interests), and the company began raising funds. Through the influence of Andrew Carnegie, Pennsylvania Railroad president J. Edgar Thomson was persuaded to personally invest in the project. This funding led to a surge of activity. The line was to be carried from Harrisburg to the crossing of the Delaware River at Portland by the South Mountain Railroad. The South Mountain and Boston Railroad was chartered in New Jersey on March 13, 1873 and also in New York to continue the line via Poughkeepsie and Boston Corners to the Massachusetts state line. At the state line, an extension of the planned Massachusetts Central Railroad would connect, taking traffic to Boston. Grading began on the various lines (known, in the aggregate, as the South Mountain and Boston Railroad), and the cornerstone was laid for a bridge pier at Poughkeepsie. However, the Panic of 1873 and the death of Thomson in May 1874 and loss of his personal support brought the project to a halt. 1876 map An attempt at revival was made in 1879. By this time the South Mountain Railroad had collapsed; a new railroad, the Pennsylvania, Poughkeepsie and New England Railroad, was incorporated on May 6, 1879 to follow its route from Harrisburg to the South Mountain and Boston connection at Portland. This company too would be short-lived; the South Mountain and Boston's New Jersey Division was renamed on March 11, 1880 to the Pennsylvania and New England Railroad, and that company's Pennsylvania Division was incorporated on May 5, 1880. The property of the PP&NE; was sold to the P&NE; (PA Division) on October 13, 1880. This does not seem to have improved the fortunes of this segment of the line; a third company, the Delaware and Slatington Railroad, was incorporated on September 9, 1881, to run from the P&NE; (NJ Division) at Portland to Slatington on the Lehigh River. The P&NE; (NJ Division) merged with the Delaware and Slatington on June 22, 1882 to form the Pennsylvania, Slatington and New England Railroad. =Pennsylvania construction: 1880-1891= In the meantime, the P&NE; (PA Division) was successful in laying one and one-sixth mile (2 km) of track to the east of Wind Gap about 1880. However, it was foreclosed on July 25, 1881, and reorganized as the Susquehanna and Delaware River Railroad on August 23, 1881; it was foreclosed again and reorganized on July 13, 1886 as the Harrisburg and New England Railroad. This company was supposedly reorganized as the Harrisburg and Eastern Railroad on July 31, 1891. =Pennsylvania, Slatington and New England Railroad: 1882-1887= The Pennsylvania, Slatington and New England Railroad was formed June 22, 1882 as a consolidation of the Pennsylvania and New England Railroad (NJ Division) and Delaware and Slatington Railroad, to build from Slatington, Pennsylvania to Pine Island, New York. In December of that year, John L. Blair, who controlled the nearby Bangor and Portland Railway, acquired control of the PS&NE;, in order to give the B&P; direct access to New England and other points. Additionally the Central Railroad of New Jersey's Lehigh and Lackawanna Railroad could no longer access points on the B&P.; Construction was carried out through 1883, with grading finished in Pennsylvania and about 12 miles west from Sussex, New Jersey. The bridge over the Delaware River at Portland was built, and rails were laid for about half of the length in Pennsylvania. In early 1883 a dispute erupted with the Wind Gap and Delaware Railroad over the tracks between Pen Argyl and Bangor, which the PS&NE; wanted to use. Later that year the company went bankrupt and construction stopped. =Pennsylvania, Poughkeepsie and Boston Railroad: 1887-1895= The Pennsylvania, Slatington and New England Railroad was sold at foreclosure to William W. Gibbs, president of the Poughkeepsie Bridge Company, on July 12, 1887, and was reorganized as the Pennsylvania, Poughkeepsie and Boston Railroad (also known as the \\"Pickles, Pork, and Beans\\" Line). Construction was begun, but the company again went bankrupt, and was sold at foreclosure December 14, 1894. Around that time, various other companies were chartered to build the line over the Poughkeepsie Bridge, and in 1889, the Central New England and Western Railroad was completed. That part would be combined with the PS&NE; in 1892 by the Philadelphia and Reading Railway, but in 1893 the two parts were split. The eastern section later became part of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad, and the western section stayed independent to the end. The Campbell Hall Connecting Railroad was chartered April 3, 1889 to obtain the right to operate the section in New York. It was originally planned to extend beyond Pine Island to Campbell Hall, the west end of the existing Poughkeepsie Bridge line. The Philadelphia and Reading Railway gained control of the Central New England and Western Railroad in early 1892, and the PP&B; soon after, giving it a route from Reading via the Schuylkill and Lehigh Railroad to Slatington, and then to New England along its new acquisitions. The Reading's bankruptcy in 1893 ended this control, and led to the PP&B;'s bankruptcy. =Lehigh and New England Railroad: 1895-1961= The Lehigh and New England Railroad (L&NE;) was organized April 2, 1895 as the successor to the PP&B.; The route from Slatington to Pine Island was accomplished but not completed. The L&NE; was able to have a route from Slatington to Pine Island even though the route wasn't completed because the L&NE; had obtain trackage rights over the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway's Sparta Junction to Columbia/Delaware Junction main line between Swartswood Junction (outside of Swartswood) and Hainesburg Junction; this line was built by the New Jersey Midland Railway from Sparta Junction to Blairstown, New Jersey and by the Blairstown Railway from Blairstown, New Jersey to Columbia/Delaware Junction and today serves as the Paulinskill Valley Trail. Despite that, a tunnel () was built under the fill for the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad's New Jersey Cut-Off (opened 1911) in case the L&NE; ever decided to complete its own line. Additionally, the planned route from Pine Island to Campbell Hall was cancelled, and trackage rights were obtained over the Erie Railroad's Goshen and Deckertown Railroad and Montgomery and Erie Railroad. The Lehigh and Lackawanna Railroad and its leased Wind Gap and Delaware Railroad were operated by the Central Railroad of New Jersey until February 1, 1905, when the two companies were merged into the L&NE.; Around the same time the L&NE; acquired the Northampton Railroad. This gave the L&NE; a branch to Bethlehem, with a branch off that one to Martins Creek. Part of the main line between Benders Junction (the crossing of the original L&NE; and the L&L;) and Pen Argyl was abandoned in 1905, with the new route using the L&L; and WG&D.; The Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company (LC&N;) gained control of the L&NE; on May 9, 1904. A yard at Maybrook, New York opened in 1912, with L&NE; trains terminating there via a section of the Central New England Railway. On July 24, 1912 a new extension opened, splitting from the main line at Danielsville, Pennsylvania and running west to Tamaqua to directly serve the LC&N.; On December 14, 1913 the L&NE; acquired the Panther Creek Railroad, running east from Tamaqua to Summit Hill, and with a connection to the Central Railroad of New Jersey's Hauto Tunnel for access to Nesquehoning obtained in 1915. On June 4, 1926 the Reading Company leased the L&NE;, but other railroads objected, and the Interstate Commerce Commission rejected the lease, preferring a lease by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad (which was never done).

The tunnel is now an integral part of Knowlton's Tunnel Field, a sports and recreation area that spans the Cut-Off via this tunnel. The LNE Board of Directors decided to end all railroad operations on October 31, 1961. Although the LNE was still profitable, the rapid decline of the anthracite coal business was seen on the horizon and the decision was made to cease operations. By this date the LNE mainline saw only one coal train per week (which usually operated on Thursdays). Trackage was removed by the following year and the bridges over the Lehigh River and Delaware River were dismantled by 1969. While a never particularly profitable system because it paralleled the Lehigh & Hudson River Railway and did not serve any large markets, the L&NE; did have a profitable cement business from its lines around Bath, Pennsylvania; the trackage which served this commodity was taken over and operated by the Central Railroad of New Jersey (CNJ), then by the Lehigh Valley in 1972 when the CNJ's lease on its Pennsylvania trackage expired and was not renewed. To railfans, the L&NE; is best remembered for its diesel motive power, which consisted entirely of models built by Alco. =Lehigh and New England Railway: 1961-= The Lehigh and New England Railway was chartered by the Central Railroad of New Jersey to take over some of the lines in Pennsylvania. Included in that sale was the main line east from Tamaqua, the old Lehigh and Lackawanna Railroad and Northampton Railroad from Bethlehem to Martins Creek, and the branch from Bethlehem west to Allentown. A short section from Pen Argyl to Wind Gap was taken over by the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad, connecting to the DL&W;'s Bangor and Portland Railway at Pen Argyl.

It was split in 1791.  History  The regiment has its origin in the Nyland cavalry () raised in 1618. In 1632, this unit was organized into a cavalry regiment. The regiment's soldiers were conscripted mainly from the county of Nyland and Tavastehus. It was one of the original eight Swedish cavalry regiments mentioned in the Swedish constitution of 1634. The regiment's first commander was Torsten Stålhandske. Finnish horsemen were also known as \\"Hakkapeliitat\\". In the spring of 1700, the regiment was transferred to General Wellingk's army corps in Swedish Livonia. From 1702 on, the regiment, with six of its eight companies, had joined the main army. In 1705-1706 it was part of Carl Gustaf Rehnskiöld's corps. After the Battle of Poltava in 1709, the regiment was present at the capitulation in Perevolochna. The regiment had to be completely reraised. It was then stationed with the army in Finland. The regiment was part of General Armfeldt's army of 7,500 men which invaded Norway through Jämtland in August 1718. The cavalry regiment was reorganized into Nyland and Tavastehus dragoon regiment in 1721. In 1791, the regiment was converted to infantry. The northern battalion was incorporated into Tavastehus county infantry regiment as its third battalion, while the southern battalion was incorporated into Nyland Infantry Regiment.

Pseudotaxus chienii. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Version 2015.2. Downloaded on 04 September 2015. (), is a species of plant in the yew family, Taxaceae. It is the sole species in the genus Pseudotaxus, but closely related to the other yews in the genus Taxus. It is endemic to southern China, occurring in northern Guangdong, northern Guangxi, Hunan, Southwest Jiangxi and southern Zhejiang. Like other yews, it is a small coniferous shrub or small tree, reaching 2–5 m tall with reddish bark. The leaves are lanceolate, flat, 1–2.6 cm long and 2–3 mm broad, dark green above, with two white stomatal bands below; they are arranged spirally on the stem, but with the leaf bases twisted to align the leaves in two flat rows either side of the stem. The conspicuous white stomatal bands on the harder, stiffer (less soft) leaves readily distinguish it from the yews in the genus Taxus. It is dioecious, with the male and female cones on different trees. The female (seed) cones are very similar to those of Taxus species, but the aril is white when mature, not red; they are 5–7 mm long and wide. The male (pollen) cones are globose, 3–4 mm diameter. It is grown as an ornamental plant in southern China and occasionally elsewhere.

Original stations of the Helsinki Metro are shown as filled squares, Länsimetro stations operational, under construction or planned as hollow squares. The first phase of the Länsimetro covers the line from Ruoholahti to Matinkylä and the second phase from Matinkylä to Kivenlahti. The municipality boundary between Helsinki and Espoo runs mostly through sea between the Koivusaari and Keilaniemi stations. Länsimetro (English: Western Metro, Swedish: Västmetron) is an extension to the Helsinki Metro system in Finland. The grand opening for the long-awaited extension was held on 18 November 2017. Länsimetro extends the system's two lines, M1 and M2, from Central Helsinki to the neighbouring city of Espoo. The new stretch continues the lines from the existing Ruoholahti station via the island of Lauttasaari, the Aalto University Otaniemi campus and Tapiola, the terminus of line M2. Line M1 continues further west to Matinkylä. Unlike previous extensions to the Helsinki Metro system, Länsimetro runs entirely underground. The second phase is scheduled to open in 2023,https://www.lansimetro.fi/en/construction/ and will continue the line further west to Kivenlahti. Final approval for a route was granted on 4 April 2007, and construction began in November 2009. In February 2014, rock blasting was complete, and the fitting out of the tunnels and construction of the stations was started. The extension was planned to open in August 2016 but was delayed until November 2017.https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-9939319  Background  The first designs for a metro system in Helsinki, made in the 1950s, already contained lines to Espoo. After the two forks of the metro line in eastern Helsinki had been completed in 1998, the city of Helsinki continued to pursue the Länsimetro proposal, but the city of Espoo continued to reject it until the early 2000s. Espoo is the second most populous city in Finland (after Helsinki), previously not connected to the metro system, but served by roads, bus transport, and commuter trains. It is connected to Helsinki by the Rantarata coastal railway and by two motorways: Finnish national road 1 (Turun moottoritie, to Turku) in the middle and the Western Highway (the Länsiväylä) in the south, near the coast. As the primary passageway between southern Espoo and central Helsinki, the Länsiväylä has been repeatedly enlarged to cope with congestion, but is still seeing chronic traffic jams in the morning rush hours. Widening the Länsiväylä has not solved the traffic jams, but has instead only moved them closer to the centre of Helsinki (see also Downs–Thomson paradox). Since the 1990s, the Finnish state and the city of Helsinki had been willing to finance a part of the Länsimetro project and prepared to commence construction. However, Espoo opposed the project for a long time, mainly because of the cost: the state had only agreed to pay 30% of the costs, while Espoo wanted it to contribute at least 70%.  Espoo's decision  In 1997, Helsinki made an official proposal to Espoo to construct the Länsimetro. A year later, on 8 December 1998, the Espoo city council decided to only support extending the line to Tapiola, rejecting a continuation to Matinkylä and to Kivenlahti. On 16 February 1999, the city council changed its mind, and voted 48 to 18 in support of building the extension to Matinkylä. (These decisions did not yet authorize construction. In June 2012, Espoo was keen on continuing the line from Matinkylä to Kivenlahti as soon as possible, wishing to commence the construction of this second phase even before the first phase enters service. ) The issue of the extension was reawakened in 2002, when the Helsinki Metropolitan Area Council (YTV) was writing a new master plan for public transportation in the Helsinki area. Counter to the view taken by the Espoo city council, YTV prioritised the Länsimetro over constructing a light rail line (an express tram) between Helsinki and Espoo. A compromise solution was reached: an investigation into the alternative of constructing such a light rail line was added to the plan, with a proposed construction schedule from 2010 to 2020. (See the subsection Controversy and alternatives, below.) According to a survey requested by Helsingin Sanomat in late 2005, 77% of Espoo residents and 90% of Helsinki residents were in favour of the Länsimetro. On 25 September 2006, the Espoo city council approved constructing the Länsimetro by a vote of 45 to 19. In its decision, the council set a number of conditions for the project: * The Finnish state must commit to financing the Länsimetro extension all the way to Kivenlahti. * The existing heavy railway line between Leppävaara and Espoo Centre should be widened from double track to triple track, in conjunction with the Länsimetro project. * The orbital Jokeri bus line should be converted to a light rail line/tram as soon as possible. * The orbital Kehä I ring road should be improved. * The orbital Kehä II ring road should be extended into Helsinki via Vihdintie to Hämeenlinnanväylä. After the construction decision by the Espoo city council, allowing city taxes to be used for the project, critics of the decision worried that such a large construction project could conceivably bankrupt the city, and sued the city in the Supreme Administrative Court of Finland on a charge of \\"neglect in the decision-making\\". Since administrative courts cannot rule on the substance of the decision, only the formal procedure was questioned. The court rejected the complaint.  Länsimetro Oy and Helsinki's decision  In June 2007, the cities of Espoo and Helsinki jointly founded a company called Länsimetro Oy (in English, \\"Western Metro Ltd.\\") to construct the extension. Espoo owns 72% of the company's stock and Helsinki owns 28%. Matti Kokkinen was appointed as the company's CEO. Following the controversies related to the delay of opening of the first phase in August 2016, Ville Saksi replaced Kokkinen as the new CEO on 14 November 2016. On 11 November 2009, the Helsinki city council approved constructing the Länsimetro. Construction started on 24 November 2009. Judicial complaints and appeals postponed the start for a year or so, but all were rejected by the Supreme Administrative Court. Indeed, , Finnish courts have rejected all charges made against the extension.  Controversy and alternatives  In 2002, a joint study by the city of Helsinki, the city of Espoo, and the Ministry of Transport and Communications compared the impact of the metro extension with that of building a bus rapid transit system. The running costs of the systems were estimated to be roughly equivalent. The metro extension would reduce emissions in Helsinki, but feeder buses would increase them in Espoo. The metro would make it faster and more convenient to travel to Helsinki from the parts of Espoo near the new stations, but would increase the travel time from outlying areas. A second studyhttp://www.raideyva.fi/ by the same parties, published in 2004, investigated the alternative option of a light rail line. Its supporters claimed that it would be cheaper, faster to implement, and more environmentally friendly than a traditional metro line. The primary disadvantage of the metro was seen to be the requirement to build denser housing along the line to make it more efficient. Espoo is a relatively loosely built city with many detached houses, leading to its reputation as an upper middle class city. There have been fears that constructing the Länsimetro would create tighter residential centres around each new metro station, and that therefore the \\"image\\" of Espoo might suffer. Supporters of the metro point out that as the population of the Helsinki area keeps increasing through domestic and international migration, building more housing is necessary in any case. Opponents of the light rail line noted that it would be yet another form of rail transport among the already diversely composed rail transport network in the capital area (trams, railway, metro); and that passengers could travel on the same metro system between all stations in Espoo and all stations in Helsinki, while constructing a light rail line would lead to all passengers travelling between east Helsinki and Espoo having to switch train systems. Supporters of the light rail line claimed that it could be easily integrated with the existing Helsinki tram network and that it would be much cheaper to build than the metro extension. In 2006, an informal private- sector shadow plan for a light rail alternative called TramWest was released. According to its critics, the plan underestimated costs and that the line was partly placed in areas where it would have been impossible to implement. TramWest also included many level crossings, which, if done badly, would slow down public transport. The proposed tracks would also have cut through the parks next to the Kiasma museum and the Helsinki Music Centre, and all the lines would have terminated at the Elielinaukio square next to the central railway station, without being integrated with any existing or future rail system. A revised version of the plan was released in early 2008, claiming to address most of these concerns. It proposed connecting Espoo with both the Länsiväylä and with Helsinki's city centre, with the eastern terminus being relocated to either Viikki or Laajasalo. Now that construction of the Länsimetro has commenced, all these alternatives have become moot.  Cost  Preliminary plans, made in 2000 and 2001, cited the cost of building the infrastructure for the metro extension to Matinkylä to be about €400 million. When the Espoo city council decided on construction of the metro in 2004, the estimated cost was €452 million. In September 2007, the estimated cost of the Länsimetro was at least €530 million. Länsimetron hinta noussut ainakin 80 miljoonaa euroa, Helsingin Sanomat 9 September 2007 page A11 In December 2007, Olavi Louko estimated that the cost will rise to at least €600 million. According to Louko, the cost of the excavation work has risen a third more than that of other ground construction work, due to security requirements and to the increase in simultaneous excavation work elsewhere, including the construction of the Kehärata (Ring Rail Line) in nearby Vantaa. Länsimetron hinta on kivunnut jo ainakin 600 miljoonaan euroon, Tarkka hinta riippuu siitä, mitä päättäjät lopulta haluavat. Helsingin Sanomat 21 December 2007 By January 2008, the estimated cost had risen to over €800 million, , and by February 2014, to about €1 billion.  Route  A metro line extension was accepted as a basis for further planning in 2000. The locations of the stations were confirmed by the cities of Espoo and Helsinki in June 2007. The extension runs underground for its entire length. The stations are: The Ruoholahti–Matinkylä section (the first three stations in Helsinki, the others in Espoo; Swedish station names in parentheses): * Ruoholahti (Gräsviken) (existing station) * Lauttasaari (Drumsö) * Koivusaari (Björkholmen) (last station in Helsinki) * Keilaniemi (Kägeludden) (first station in Espoo) * Aalto-yliopisto (Aalto-universitetet) (Aalto University) * Tapiola (Hagalund) * Urheilupuisto (Idrottsparken) * Niittykumpu (Ängskulla) * Matinkylä (Mattby)  Construction  Tapiola metro station The work started in January 2010 with the extension of the tunnels at the Ruoholahti metro station, and rock blasting in Espoo commenced in August 2010. All contracts for tunneling and station building were signed in December 2011, and rock blasting reached 50% completion in July 2012. The excavation of the first stations began in 2012. The excavation work on the tunnels was completed on 27 February 2014, while the fitting out of the tunnels and construction of the stations was ongoing. The last of the tracks were laid in Matinkylä in December 2015. In January 2014, the estimated date of opening for service was pushed back to autumn 2016 at the earliest. While physical construction was complete in schedule, there were numerous other problems, with automatization, project schedules, project leadership and safety systems. Not enough time was scheduled for safety system integration tests, which then failed, causing delay. There was poor workmanship with track installation. Rock dust was left behind from blasting and was not cleaned. Doors were substandard. There was poor communication from the cities via Länsimetro and the main contractor Sweco to the building contractors. The general manager of the project was fired. A report detailing the reasons for the failures was written, but was not released due to \\"advice from lawyers\\".https://www.mtv.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/artikkeli/lansimetron- surullisenkuuluisa-saaga-viivastyksia-tyrittyja-asennustoita-ja-sadoilla- miljoonilla-paisunut-budjetti/6293934https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-9022192  The second phase  On 3 February 2014, the city board of Espoo decided to propose to the city council constructing a continuation of the new line to Kivenlahti, with the proviso that the Finnish state would commit to paying 30% of the construction costs. This continuation would run entirely within Espoo, and would serve five new stations. On 24 February 2014, the Espoo city council approved the proposal by a vote of 65 to 10. Starting the construction of the second phase immediately after the conclusion of the first phase has been calculated to save about 130 million euros, compared to a five-year delay between the construction of the two phases. The estimated cost of the second phase was in 2013 €801 million.

History 1876 map of the line and its extension to Boston The railroad was incorporated May 5, 1854 by a group of largely local investors. It was to run from Harrisburg to Jonestown, from thence along the south side of Blue Mountain to Rehrersburg and to Hamburg. The name was changed to the Harrisburg and Hamburg Railroad on March 17, 1859, but was changed back to \\"South Mountain Railroad\\" on May 21, 1873. On April 11, 1868, the South Side Railroad was incorporated to connect the South Mountain Railroad, at the border of Berks and Lehigh Counties (near Hamburg) to the Delaware River, via Lehigh, Moore, or Plainfield Townships in Northampton County. Around 1872, these lines were taken over to become part of the Poughkeepsie Bridge Route. Grading began on the South Mountain Railroad between Rockville and Linglestown, and the corporate enrollment tax was paid for the South Side Railroad in 1873. However, the collapse of the Bridge Route plans in the Panic of 1873 brought work to a halt. On February 16, 1874, President William H. Bell announced that the company would also build a branch from Strausstown to Reading, via Bernville, and claimed that two-thirds of the line between Harrisburg and Strausstown was complete. However, the financial climate made it impossible to raise significant funds. Further work appears to have been performed, sporadically, by local interests, who hoped to connect the town of Fredericksburg with the Lebanon and Tremont Branch of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad at Jonestown. Bridge piers were erected for the crossing of Swatara Creek, a cut was excavated to the north of Jonestown, and some culverts were constructed and grading done on the route to Fredericksburg. However, the company was forced to auction off its personal property in October 1877, and in February 1880, \\"the rights-of-way, leases and passenger cars were sold.\\" The company does not appear to have laid track or operated. The remaining assets of the company were sold to the Pennsylvania and New England Railroad later that year. Another account claims that the charter was sold to the Harrisburg and New England Railroad at a sheriff's sale on November 30, 1888. Despite its financial collapse and dismantling, the shell of the company was reorganized on August 8, 1893 as the Blue Mountain Railroad, on August 12, 1901 as the Harrisburg and South Mountain Railroad, which was inactive by 1912. While the piers and grading west of Fredericksburg are still visible, the cut through Jonestown was used as a garbage dump and later filled to form Swatara Drive.

Much like multi- function displays, primary flight displays are built around a Liquid-crystal display or CRT display device. Representations of older six pack or \\"steam gauge\\" instruments are combined on one compact display, simplifying pilot workflow and streamlining cockpit layouts. Most airliners built since the 1980s — as well as many business jets and an increasing number of newer general aviation aircraft — have glass cockpits equipped with primary flight and multi-function displays (MFDs). Cirrus Aircraft was the first general aviation manufacturer to add a PFD to their already existing MFD, which they made standard on their SR-series aircraft in 2003. Mechanical gauges have not been completely eliminated from the cockpit with the onset of the PFD; they are retained for backup purposes in the event of total electrical failure.  Components  While the PFD does not directly use the pitot-static system to physically display flight data, it still uses the system to make altitude, airspeed, vertical speed, and other measurements precisely using air pressure and barometric readings. An air data computer analyzes the information and displays it to the pilot in a readable format. A number of manufacturers produce PFDs, varying slightly in appearance and functionality, but the information is displayed to the pilot in a similar fashion. FAA regulation describes that a PFD includes at a minimum, an airspeed indicator, turn coordinator, attitude indicator, heading indicator, altimeter, and vertical speed indicator [14 CFR Part 61.129(j)(1)]. Layout PFD with key instrument displays labelled PFD Garmin 1000. The details of the display layout on a primary flight display can vary enormously, depending on the aircraft, the aircraft's manufacturer, the specific model of PFD, certain settings chosen by the pilot, and various internal options that are selected by the aircraft's owner (i.e., an airline, in the case of a large airliner). However, the great majority of PFDs follow a similar layout convention. The center of the PFD usually contains an attitude indicator (AI), which gives the pilot information about the aircraft's pitch and roll characteristics, and the orientation of the aircraft with respect to the horizon. Unlike a traditional attitude indicator, however, the mechanical gyroscope is not contained within the panel itself, but is rather a separate device whose information is simply displayed on the PFD. The attitude indicator is designed to look very much like traditional mechanical AIs. Other information that may or may not appear on or about the attitude indicator can include the stall angle, a runway diagram, ILS localizer and glide-path “needles”, and so on. Unlike mechanical instruments, this information can be dynamically updated as required; the stall angle, for example, can be adjusted in real time to reflect the calculated critical angle of attack of the aircraft in its current configuration (airspeed, etc.). The PFD may also show an indicator of the aircraft's future path (over the next few seconds), as calculated by onboard computers, making it easier for pilots to anticipate aircraft movements and reactions. To the left and right of the attitude indicator are usually the airspeed and altitude indicators, respectively. The airspeed indicator displays the speed of the aircraft in knots, while the altitude indicator displays the aircraft's altitude above mean sea level (AMSL). These measurements are conducted through the aircraft's pitot system, which tracks air pressure measurements. As in the PFD's attitude indicator, these systems are merely displayed data from the underlying mechanical systems, and do not contain any mechanical parts (unlike an aircraft's airspeed indicator and altimeter). Both of these indicators are usually presented as vertical “tapes”, which scroll up and down as altitude and airspeed change. Both indicators may often have “bugs”, that is, indicators that show various important speeds and altitudes, such as V speeds calculated by a flight management system, do-not-exceed speeds for the current configuration, stall speeds, selected altitudes and airspeeds for the autopilot, and so on. The vertical speed indicator, usually next to the altitude indicator, indicates to the pilot how fast the aircraft is ascending or descending, or the rate at which the altitude changes. This is usually represented with numbers in \\"thousands of feet per minute.\\" For example, a measurement of \\"+2\\" indicates an ascent of 2000 feet per minute, while a measurement of \\"-1.5\\" indicates a descent of 1500 feet per minute. There may also be a simulated needle showing the general direction and magnitude of vertical movement. At the bottom of the PFD is the heading display, which shows the pilot the magnetic heading of the aircraft. This functions much like a standard magnetic heading indicator, turning as required. Often this part of the display shows not only the current heading, but also the current track (actual path over the ground), rate of turn,G1000 Manual, Turn Rate Indicator current heading setting on the autopilot, and other indicators. Other information displayed on the PFD includes navigational marker information, bugs (to control the autopilot), ILS glideslope indicators, course deviation indicators, altitude indicator QFE settings, and much more. Although the layout of a PFD can be very complex, once a pilot is accustomed to it the PFD can provide an enormous amount of information with a single glance. = Airbus = Starting with the A350-1000, Airbus proposes a common symbology on the PFD and HUD centered on a flightpath vector and an energy cue instead of a flight director, supplementing the usual pitch and heading indications to improve situational awareness, and helping incorporating synthetic vision into the PFD. Drawbacks The great variability in the precise details of PFD layout makes it necessary for pilots to study the specific PFD of the specific aircraft they will be flying in advance, so that they know exactly how certain data is presented. While the basics of flight parameters tend to be much the same in all PFDs (speed, attitude, altitude), much of the other useful information presented on the display is shown in different formats on different PFDs. For example, one PFD may show the current angle of attack as a tiny dial near the attitude indicator, while another may actually superimpose this information on the attitude indicator itself. Since the various graphic features of the PFD are not labeled, the pilot must learn what they all mean in advance. A failure of a PFD deprives the pilot of an extremely important source of information. While backup instruments will still provide the most essential information, they may be spread over several locations in the cockpit, which must be scanned by the pilot, whereas the PFD presents all this information on one display. Additionally, some of the less important information, such as speed and altitude bugs, stall angles, and the like, will simply disappear if the PFD malfunctions; this may not endanger the flight, but it does increase pilot workload and diminish situational awareness.

Biography  Tjuyu is believed to be a descendant of Queen Ahmose-Nefertari, and she held many official roles in the interwoven religion and government of ancient Egypt. She was involved in many religious cults; her titles included 'Singer of Hathor' and 'Chief of the Entertainers' of both Amun and Min.Tyldesley, Joyce. Chronicles of the Queens of Egypt.

She is believed to have died in around 1375 BC in her early to mid 50s.  Children  Yuya and Tjuyu had a daughter named Tiye, who became the Great Royal Wife of Pharaoh Amenhotep III. The great royal wife was the highest Egyptian religious position, serving alongside of the pharaoh in official ceremonies and rituals.

However, there is no conclusive evidence regarding the kinship of Yuya and Ay, although certainly, both men came from Akhmim.David, Anthony, E. and Rosalie David. A Biographical Dictionary of Ancient Egypt. London: Seaby, 1992. p.167  Tomb  The mummy of Tjuyu Tjuyu was interred in tomb KV46 in the Valley of the Kings, together with her husband Yuya, where their largely intact burial was found in 1905. It was the best-preserved tomb discovered in the Valley before that of Tutankhamun, Tjuyu's great-grandson. The tomb was discovered by a team of workmen led by archaeologist James Quibell on behalf of the American millionaire Theodore M. Davis. Though the tomb had been robbed in antiquity, much of its contents were still present, including beds, boxes, chests, a chariot, and the sarcophagi, coffins, and mummies of the two occupants. Tjuyu's large gilded and black-painted wooden sarcophagus was placed against the south wall of the tomb. Rectangular and with a lid shaped like sloping roof the per-wer shrine of Upper Egypt, this sarcophagus sat on ornamental sledge runners, their non-functionality underscored by the three battens attached below them. This sarcophagus had contained the two nested anthropoid coffins of Tjuyu. Ancient robbers had partially dismantled it, placing its lid and one long side on a bed on the other side of the tomb; the other long side had been leaned against the south wall. Her outer gilded anthropoid coffin had been removed, its lid placed atop the beds, and the trough put into the far corner of the tomb; the lid of her second (innermost) coffin, also gilded, had been removed and placed to one side though the trough and her mummy remained inside the sarcophagus. Quibell suggests this is due to the robbers having some difficulty in removing the lid of this coffin. =Mummy= Tjuyu's mummified body was found covered with a large sheet of linen, knotted at the back and secured by four bandages. These bands were covered with resin and opposite each band were her gilded titles cut from gold foil. The resin coating on the lower layers of bandages preserved the impression of a large broad collar. The mummy bands that had once covered her wrapped mummy were recovered above the storage jars on the far side of the room. The first examination of her body was conducted by Australian anatomist Grafton Elliot Smith. He found her to be an elderly woman of small stature, in height, with white hair. Both of her earlobes had two piercings. Her arms are straight had her sides with her hands against the outside of her thighs. Her embalming incision is stitched with thread, to which a carnelian barrel bead is attached at the lower end; her body cavity is stuffed with resin-soaked linen. When Dr. Douglas Derry, (who later conducted the first examination of Tutankhamun's mummy) assisting Smith in his examination, exposed Tjuyu's feet to get an accurate measurement of her height, he found her to be wearing gold foil sandals. Smith estimated her age at more than 50 years based on her outward appearance alone. Recent CT scanning has estimated her age at death to be 50–60 years old. Her brain was removed, though no embalming material was inserted, and both nostrils were stuffed linen. Embalming packs had been placed into her eye sockets, and subcutaneous filling had been placed into her mid and lower face to restore a life-like appearance; embalming material had also been placed into her mouth and throat. Her teeth were in poor condition at the time of her death, with missing molars. Heavy wear and abscesses had been noted in earlier x-rays. The scan revealed that she had severe scoliosis with a Cobb angle of 25 degrees. No cause of death could be determined.

As a whole, Oregon provides the sport of racquetball with nationally recognized programs, events and players. Each association is run separately with its own board of directors, budgets and sponsors. Oregon Racquetball Association The Oregon Racquetball Association (ORA) is the state governing body for USA Racquetball, the national governing body of the sport. It has a board of directors and is responsible for sanctioning tournaments throughout the state. Tournaments are held at various athletic clubs and contain divisions for many skill levels and age/skill levels. The Open division is considered the top division of play, followed by Elite, A, B, C & D. Divisions are offered for men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles and mixed doubles. Oregon High School Racquetball League The Oregon High School Racquetball League (OHSRL) celebrated its 10th Year during the 2004-2005 Season. The league started with three schools and 30 players, and now has more than 350 participants from 24 schools. The season comprises four league matches, followed by the State Championships and the National Championships. Oregon and St. Louis, Missouri are considered to have the nation's strongest high school racquetball programs, and the National Championships alternate between the two locations every year. In 2006, the event was held in Salem. In 2006, Beaverton won the National Team Championship in the boys, girls, and overall divisions. The top three high school teams in the nation in 2005 were from Oregon. Catlin Gabel won its second consecutive National Team Championship, with Beaverton finishing second followed by Sprague. Beaverton has won five National Team Championships (1996, 1997, 1999, 2006, & 2007) in its existence; Sprague won the title in 1998 and North Salem in 2000. Oregon Junior Racquetball Association The Oregon Junior Racquetball Association (OJRA) is the crown jewel of junior racquetball programs in the country, if not the world. Like the ORA Tour, the season is made up of events held monthly. The OJRA Tour typically starts in September and runs through April. There is then a regional event, followed by the National Junior Championships in July.

Karuks are also enrolled in two other federally recognized tribes, the Cher-Ae Heights Indian Community of the Trinidad Rancheria\\"Cher-Ae Heights Indian Community of the Trinidad Rancheria.\\" Alliance for California Traditional Arts. 2009. Retrieved 25 June 2012. and the Quartz Valley Indian Community. Happy Camp, California, is located in the heart of the Karuk Tribe's ancestral territory, which extends along the Klamath River from Bluff Creek (near the community of Orleans in Humboldt County) through Siskiyou County and into Southern Oregon. Name The name \\"Karuk,\\" also spelled \\"Karok,\\" means \\"upriver people\\", or \\"upstream\\" people, and are called Chum-ne in Tolowa. Language The Karuk people speak the Karuk language, a language isolate. The tribe has an active language revitalization program. Population Estimates for the population sizes of most Native groups before European arrival in California have varied substantially. Alfred L. Kroeber proposed a population for the Karuk of 1,500 in 1770. Sherburne F. Cook initially estimated it as 2,000, later raising this figure to 2,700. In 1910, Kroeber reported the surviving population of the Karuk as 800. According to the 2010 census, there were 6,115 Karuk individuals, of which 3,431 were full-blooded. Culture Pre-contact distribution of the Karuk Since time immemorial, the Karuk resided in villages along the Klamath River, where they continue such cultural traditions as hunting, gathering, fishing, basketmaking and ceremonial dances. The Karuk were the only California tribe to grow tobacco plants. The Brush Dance, Jump Dance and Pikyavish ceremonies last for several days and are practiced to heal and \\"fix the world,\\" to pray for plentiful acorns, deer and salmon, and to restore social goodwill as well as individual good luck. In the summers of 1871 and 1872, an amateur ethnographer by the name of Stephen Powers visited Indian groups in Northern California. His published observations offer an insight into the lives of the native survivors of the California Gold Rush. According to Powers, the Karok (Karuk) were one of three groups living on the Klamath River (the others being the Yurok and Modoc). He also noted that there was no recollection of any ancient migration to the region; instead there were legends of Creation and the Flood which were fabled to have occurred on the Klamath. Some of Powers' other observations were that: The Karuk developed sophisticated usage of plants and animals for their subsistence. These practices not only consisted of food harvesting from nature, but also the use of plant and animal materials as tools, clothing and pharmaceuticals. The Karuk cultivated a form of tobacco, and used fronds of the Coastal woodfern as anti-microbial agents in the process of preparing eels for food consumption.C. Michael Hogan. 2008.

It was produced in 2002 and aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on June 1, 2002. In this episode, SpongeBob and Patrick become entrepreneurs in an attempt to live the fancy life. Plot SpongeBob accidentally receives Squidward's Fancy Living Digest magazine in the mail, inspiring him and Patrick Star to become entrepreneurs. Per Patrick's suggestion, the pair become door-to-door chocolate bar salesmen, which results in them purchasing large quantities of chocolate bars from the Barg 'n' Mart. Their first customer is a crazy fish who maniacally and repeatedly screams \\"CHOCOLATE!\\", which scares the pair away. Afterwards, SpongeBob and Patrick attempt to sell chocolate to another fish, who cons them into buying chocolate-carrying bags twice in a row. They then try to sell to a woman who wants to buy a chocolate bar, but when SpongeBob is not able to find one because of all of the carrying bags, the customer loses her patience. When SpongeBob finally finds a chocolate bar, he and Patrick are chased away again by the chocolate fanatic. After their disastrous results in their previous attempts, the two take a break at a diner, and decide to \\"try being nice\\". However, this is unsuccessful, ending in Patrick buying pictures of a customer as an overweight child, as is their attempt to \\"focus\\" (resulting in Patrick staring at a customer until the customer slams the door on Patrick's eyes). Then, they decide that the only way to sell chocolate is to \\"stretch the truth\\", which is successful when they convince a very old woman (to the dismay of her elderly daughter Mary) that it \\"makes you live forever\\". The lying continues, but after they attempt to help a seriously injured man (who turns out to be the same man who sold SpongeBob and Patrick the carrying bags in disguise) by buying his chocolate, their profit is lost. However, the chocolate fanatic catches up to them, and, in a turn of events, buys all of the chocolate that SpongeBob and Patrick have. They then use the money to rent out a fancy restaurant, allowing access only to themselves and their dates: Mary and her mother. Production \\"Chocolate with Nuts\\" was written by Paul Tibbitt, Kaz, Kent Osborne and Merriwether Williams, with Andrew Overtoom serving as animation director.

DVD. Paramount Home Entertainment, 2009. Reception \\"Chocolate with Nuts\\" has received acclaim from both critics and fans alike and is often cited as one of the show's best episodes. Emily Estep of \\"WeGotThisCovered.com\\" rated the episode as the 10th best SpongeBob SquarePants episode, saying \\"The reason 'Chocolate with Nuts' is such a good episode is that it subtly and somewhat darkly hints at the concept of just how crazy the people who live around you are. SpongeBob and Patrick are mostly swindled into buying things from other people – actually, a single con man who keeps appearing – and nothing is more terrifying/hilarious than the man who simply starts screaming 'chocolate' repeatedly until SpongeBob and Patrick run away. 'Chocolate with Nuts' adds the complete absurdity of the program – like the old lady and her even older mother who remembers when 'they first invented chocolate. Sweet, sweet chocolate. I always hated it!' – and the aspects of SpongeBob's undersea life that mirror our own lives on land – like stranger danger.\\" Nancy Basile of About.com ranked the episode 5 on her \\"Best SpongeBob SquarePants Episodes\\" list. She said \\"I can relate to the customer who spends this entire episode running around Bikini Bottom, screaming for chocolate. 'Chocolate with Nuts' is about Patrick and SpongeBob trying to get rich by selling chocolate bars door to door ... There are witty punchlines and silly sight gags throughout the episode.\\" Her favorite scene was when \\"Patrick focuses a little too hard on their unsuspecting customer.\\" SpongeBob's voice actor Tom Kenny considers this one of his favorite episodes. It was included in the iTunes collection \\"SpongeBob SquarePants: Tom Kenny's Top 20\\", where he called it \\"a very sick episode. You can spend hours theorizing about what these eleven minutes says about truth, lies, Big Business, entrepreneurship, and consumerism.\\" ReferencesExternal links * * Category:SpongeBob SquarePants episodes Category:2002 American television episodes ","title":"Chocolate with Nuts"},{"id":"2288227","text":"The year 1895 in archaeology involved some significant events.

Ypres district Ypres lies at the junction of the Ypres–Comines Canal and the Ieperlee. The city is overlooked by Kemmel Hill in the south-west and from the east by low hills running south-west to north-east with Wytschaete (Wijtschate), Hill 60 to the east of Verbrandenmolen, Hooge, Polygon Wood and Passchendaele (Passendale). The high point of the ridge is at Wytschaete, from Ypres, while at Hollebeke the ridge is distant and recedes to at Polygon Wood. Wytschaete is about above the plain; on the Ypres–Menin road at Hooge, the elevation is about and at Passchendaele. The rises are slight, apart from the vicinity of Zonnebeke, which has a From Hooge and to the east, the slope is near Hollebeke, it is heights are subtle but have the character of a saucer lip around Ypres. The main ridge has spurs sloping east and one is particularly noticeable at Wytschaete, which runs south-east to Messines (Mesen), with a gentle slope to the east and a to the west. Further south is the muddy valley of the Douve river, Ploegsteert Wood (\\"Plugstreet\\" to the British) and Hill 63. West of Messines Ridge is the parallel Wulverghem (Spanbroekmolen) Spur; the Oosttaverne Spur, also parallel, is to the east. The general aspect south of Ypres is of low ridges and dips, gradually flattening to the north into a featureless plain. In 1914, Ypres had and inside medieval earth ramparts faced with brick and a ditch on the east and south sides. Possession of the higher ground to the south and east of the city gives ample scope for ground observation, enfilade fire and converging artillery fire. An occupier of the ridges also has the advantage that artillery positions and the movement of reinforcements and supplies can be screened from view. The ridge had woods from Wytschaete to Zonnebeke, giving good cover, some of notable size such as Polygon Wood and those later named Battle Wood, Shrewsbury Forest and Sanctuary Wood. The woods usually had undergrowth but fields in gaps between the woods were wide and devoid of cover. Roads in this area were usually unpaved, except for the main ones from Ypres, with occasional villages and houses. The lowlands west of the ridge were a mixture of meadow and fields with high hedgerows dotted with trees, cut by streams and ditches emptying into the canals. The Ypres–Comines Canal is about wide and the Yperlee about ; the main road to Ypres between Poperinge and Vlamertinge is in a defile, easily observed from the ridge. Battles of Ypres Salient A salient in military terms is a battlefield feature that projects into an opponent's territory and is surrounded on three sides, making the occupying troops vulnerable. Throughout World War I along the Western Front, troops engaged in mine warfare, using tunnelling and trench strategies without coordinating their attacks with one another. Soldiers used tunnels and dugouts to shelter themselves, safely make their way to the front lines, relay messages, and launch offensive attacks on their enemies.The Ypres Salient during the Second Battle of Ypres = First Battle of Ypres = By 29 December 1914, German troops dug in on higher ground to the east of Ypres and consequently, the Ypres Salient was formed by British, French, Canadian and Belgian defensive efforts against German incursion during the 1914 Race to the Sea. This culminated in the Battle of the Yser and the First Battle of Ypres, which lasted until 7 June 1917. German and British units conducted operations, made advancements, captured territory and attacked using mines and underground warfare at locations like Broodseinde and Sint Elooi. = Second and Third Battles of Ypres = The Second Battle of Ypres occurred from 22 April to 25 May 1915, the British and French defending Ypres and the corner of Belgium around Veurne from German occupation but escalating trench warfare in the salient. Both sides vied for control of tactically important areas along the line. Obtaining control of the few hills and ridges became the objective of this battle in which poisonous gas as a weapon was first deployed and the widespread destruction and evacuation of Ypres came about. During this battle, the Allied units were forced to draw back from Zonnebeke and St Julien to a line of trenches closer to Ypres as German troops held the village of Hooge on Bellewaerde Ridge. This line defined the Ypres Salient for over two years, during which Hooge lay in one of the easternmost sectors of the salient and was much contested. This situation changed little, despite extensive British tunnelling prior to the Battle of Messines in June 1917 and the Third Battle of Ypres (Passchendaele) from July to November. During these battles, tactics shifted from offensive tunnelling to maintaining shelters and constructing dugouts. = Fourth Battle of Ypres = After the Third Battle of Ypres, the Ypres Salient was left relatively quiet until the Fourth Battle of Ypres (Battle of the Lys), when the German Spring Offensive threatened to overwhelm the area. This offensive was stopped at the point the Allies were closest to being forced to abandon the salient. By August 1918, the Fifth Battle of Ypres (part of the Hundred Days Offensive) pushed the German forces out of the salient entirely and they did not return.  Archaeological significance  In the aftermath of trench warfare, mine explosions, extensive tunnelling, craters and archaeological landmarks remain. Although many craters have been covered, built over, destroyed, or remodelled, some are still visible and can be preserved, such as The Bluff, a key location in the First Battle of Ypres and now a well-studied historical reserve where artefacts were found. Using Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping, Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS), remote sensing, and aerial photographs, more recent research and archaeological work have provided insight into the landscape, battle zones and tactics employed in the Ypres Salient. Analysis of craters at the site yielded information confirming various historical accounts of counter-mines and hot spots as well as specifying when mining weapons were used in the Second Battle of Ypres as well as how the Battle of Messines was important in changing the geography of the frontlines main conflicts occurred.

During the Second World War, Wallis served in the Royal Air Force and flew 28 bomber missions over Germany; after the war, he moved on to research and development, before retiring in 1964. He later became one of the leading exponents of autogyros and earned 34 world records, still holding eight of them at the time of his death in 2013. Early life Born on 26 April 1916 at Ely, He was educated at The Kings' School Ely Cambridgeshire. Wallis developed a practical interest in mechanics, building a motorcycle at the age of 11. In 1936, he was inspired by a demonstration by Henri Mignet of his Mignet HM.14 Pou-du-Ciel (\\"Flying Flea\\"). Using only Mignet's book, Wallis gathered the materials required, and started to build his own Flying Flea. He abandoned construction because of widespread adverse publicity about fatal accidents that implied inadequate design of the type.Hancock (2010) Wallis took an interest in powerboats which he kept up until 1957, when he won the long Missouri Marathon. Military career Wallis was keen to join the RAF, and applied for their Volunteer Reserve Service, but he was turned down due to a defective right eye. Consequently, he obtained a private flying licence. which required only a certificate signed by his GP. Wallis obtained his A Licence for dual and solo flying in a record 12 hours. In 1938, Wallis tried to join the RAF again, this time with the newly formed RAF Short Service Commission Scheme, but again failed the eye test. In 1939, he was called up to RAF Uxbridge, and again was sent for a medical. When it came to the eyesight test he managed to pass, as Wallis later recalled, \\"I did the first line with my good eye then they covered it up and asked me to read the bottom line with my bad eye, without them realising I just turned my head slightly so I could again see with my good eye — I passed it with Above Average Eye Sight!\\"\\"Meeting a legend - British Aviation Pioneer, Bomber Pilot and James Bond Stunt man – Ken Wallis MBE\\" visit-suffolkcoast.co.uk.

Wallis subsequently served in Italy and on secondment to the United States Strategic Air Command, where he flew the massive Convair B-36, that had six piston engines and four auxiliary jet engines. Thereafter, he was involved in research and development, and was awarded a number of patents on his inventions. Wallis left the RAF in 1964, retiring to Norfolk. Autogyros Wallis produced autogyros for, in his own words, \\"reconnaissance, research and development, surveillance and military purposes\\", and his designs were not available for enthusiasts as he considered that although the design is simple, it has to be built to the appropriate standards. His contribution to autogyro design included the \\"offset gimbal rotor head\\".\\"Wallis Autogyros.\\" Flight. Retrieved: 22 September 2011. Wallis had the help of Beagle Aircraft in building five Wallis WA-116 autogyros at Shoreham in 1962 for evaluation by the British Army. This collaboration ended when the British Army chose the Westland Sioux for this role. Wallis worked as Sean Connery's stunt pilot in the 1967 James Bond film You Only Live Twice, where he flew one of his WA-116s named Little Nellie. In 1970 it was announced that Airmark would produce his autogyro design with a certificate of airworthiness (C of A), that being essential for commercial use of the autogyro. Expected price was around £3,000.\\"Private Flying: Wallis goes commercial.\\" Flight, 3 September 1970. Between 2006 and 2009, Wallis took part in filming for Into the Wind, a documentary by Steven Hatton featuring the experiences and memories of wartime members of Bomber Command.

As part of the comics creator group Man of Action Studios, Kelly is one of the creators of the animated series Ben 10. Career Kelly attended Freeport High School and went on to receive his MFA at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, where he still teaches Writing for Animation/Writing for Comics. At NYU, he was recruited into Marvel Comics' editor James Felder's Stan-hattan Project, a program that trained potential comic book writers at the university. After six months of working in the class, Felder offered Kelly a job scripting Fantastic Four 2099 over a Karl Kesel plot. Kelly took the assignment, but his first published work for Marvel was 1996's 2099: World of Tomorrow #1–8 and Marvel Fanfare vol.2 #2–3. In 1997, Kelly began his first monthly assignment, Deadpool, initially pencilled by Ed McGuinness. The title was immediately well received by fans and critics. At one point it was due to be cancelled with #25, but a write-in and Internet campaign by fans led Marvel to reverse their decision. Kelly left the title with #33 in 1999. In 1997, Kelly also became the writer of Daredevil, on which he was accompanied by well-known Daredevil artist Gene Colan. At around the same time he produced a Daredevil/Deadpool '97 Annual with artist Bernard Chang which pitted the two characters against each other and was generally well received. Kelly left Daredevil with #375 in 1998. Kelly's next major Marvel assignment was in late 1997, at the company's then bestselling title, X-Men, where he worked with penciller Carlos Pacheco. However, Kelly's stint on the title, and his friend Steven T. Seagle's run on sister title Uncanny X-Men, was cut short when the creators quit, blaming constant editorial interference. Kelly's last issue was #85 in 1999. Kelly then began to work for Marvel's competitor DC Comics, specifically their Action Comics title starring Superman with #760 in October 1999. He stayed on the title for almost five years (up until #813, May 2004), working mainly with penciller Pasqual Ferry. During this run he authored \\"What's So Funny About Truth, Justice & the American Way?\\" in Action Comics #775, which introduced The Elite (an Authority-like team of anti-heroes) and their leader Manchester Black. That issue was called \\"the single best issue of a comic book written in the year 2001\\" by Wizard Magazine. In December 2000, Kelly had a short stint as writer on the Superboy comic (#83–93), again mostly working with his Action Comics collaborator Ferry. In 2002 he began a long run on DC's JLA (#61–93) comic book with penciller Doug Mahnke. After their run on that title finished the same creative team launched a twelve-issue limited series Justice League Elite featuring some of the characters from Action Comics #775.Joey Kelly on Justice League Elite , NewsaramaJoseph League Elite – Joey Kelly Talks JLE, Comic Book Resources Also in 2002, DC published Green Lantern: Legacy – The Last Will & Testament of Hal Jordan, a hardcover graphic novel by Kelly and artists Brent Anderson and Bill Sienkiewicz, which looked back at the life and career of Hal Jordan, who at that point was the Spectre.

He was of Polish-Jewish origin. His parents were Jewish refugees from Warsaw. Kraus, Jerelle. “Endpaper -- The Lives They Lived: Roland Topor; A Graphic Wit”. The New York Times Magazine. 4 Jan 1998 He spent the early years of his life in Savoy, where his family hid him from the Nazi peril.https://www.lambiek.net/artists/t/topor_roland.htm  Biography  Roland Topor's parents came to France in the 1930s. In 1941 Topor's father, Abram, along with thousands of other Jewish men living in Paris, were required to register with the Vichy authorities. Topor's father was subsequently arrested and interned in a prison camp at Pithiviers, where inmates would be held before being sent to other concentration camps, usually Auschwitz. Of the thousands who were sent to Pithiviers only 159 survived. But Topor's father, Abram, managed to escape from Pithiviers and hide in an area south of Paris. Hodgson, Andrew. \\"Blood, Shit, and Sex\\". The Paris Review. 22 March 2019. While his father was in hiding, Topor's landlady would confront the children, Topor and his older sister Hélène d'Almeida-Topor, and try to cajole them into giving away the location of their father. The landlady did not succeed. Then in May 1941 a neighbor tipped off the Topor family that the French police along with the Gestapo were going to search the entire building. So the family fled to Vichy France. In Savoy, four-year-old Roland Topor was placed in a French family, was given a false name, and took on the identity of a Catholic schoolboy. Hodgson, Andrew. \\"Blood, Shit, and Sex\\". The Paris Review. 22 March 2019. The family survived, and in 1946 they sued the landlady to have their belongings returned, and to be allowed to resume living in their former apartment. The court ruled in their favor, they returned, and soon were once again paying rent to the landlady who had previously tried to have them apprehended. Hodgson, Andrew. \\"Blood, Shit, and Sex\\". The Paris Review. 22 March 2019. The night before he died of a cerebral hemorrhage, it is reported that he couldn't sleep, and instead spend the night visiting Parisian cafes, enjoying Cuban cigars, and drinking Bordeaux wine. When he arrived at the Cafe de Flore, he recounted a nightmarish dream he experienced. It was a dream that he thought might inspire his next novel: Kraus, Jerelle. “Endpaper -- The Lives They Lived: Roland Topor; A Graphic Wit”. The New York Times Magazine. 4 Jan 1998 Art Roland Topor may be best known for his graphic works with their surrealist humor. He studied at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. His artworks have appeared in books, newspapers, posters, and film animations. Author: S. S. M. “The eclectic genius of Roland Topor”. The Economist. Apr 11th 2017 Literature Few of Topor's writings are available in English. His fictions are sometimes classed as \\"post-surrealist horror\\" that go beyond established limits, to portray carnivalesque worlds of bizarre situations, in which human realities that are normally unspoken are laid bare in confrontations with (using Topor's phrase) \\"le sang, la merde et le sexe\\" (blood, shit, and sex). Hodgson, Andrew. \\"Blood, Shit, and Sex\\". The Paris Review. 22 March 2019. Roland Topor wrote the novel The Tenant (Le Locataire chimérique, 1964), which was adapted to film by Roman Polanski in 1976. The Tenant is the story of a Parisian of Polish descent, who develops an obsession regarding what has happened to his apartment's previous tenant. Kraus, Jerelle. “Endpaper -- The Lives They Lived: Roland Topor; A Graphic Wit”. The New York Times Magazine. 4 Jan 1998 It is a chilling exploration of alienation and identity, asking disturbing questions about how we define ourselves.

Themes Topor returned to in his later novel Head- to-Toe Portrait of Suzanne (1978). In 1965 David De Silva (Becca Productions Ltd) bought the film rights to The Tenant for $15,000 and sent the novel to Roman Polanski in the hope that he would consider directing it. De Silva made the mistake of phoning Polanski from New York around 7PM which would be just about midnight London time. He received Polanski's response to the project in a letter dated 4 May 1966.David De Silva Subsequently, De Silva sold the rights to Universal Pictures because Edward Albee wanted to adapt it as his first screenplay under a three-picture deal with Universal but the deal never materialized. Polanski adapted the film 10 years later in 1976. De Silva believes Polanski never read the novel 10 years before. He says, \\"When the timing is right the timing is right.\\".David De Silva A new presentation of The Tenant by Roland Topor was released in October 2006. The book has Topor's original novel, a new introduction by Thomas Ligotti, a selection of short stories by Topor, a representation of Topor's artwork and an essay on the famous Roman Polanski film version. Thomas Ligotti's introduction clocks in at 3500 words and concerns the affirmative themes of world-renowned authors, focusing on Luigi Pirandello, with the negationist themes of Roland Topor's The Tenant. In 2018, Atlas Press published Topor's Head-to-Toe Portrait of Suzanne, translated and introduced by Andrew Hodgson. It was the first of Topor's novels to enter English in nearly 50 years.https://www.atlaspress.co.uk/index.cgi?action=chrono Songs Roland Topor wrote two songs for Megumi Satsu, \\"Je m'aime\\" and \\"Monte dans mon Ambulance\\".https://www.lambiek.net/artists/t/topor_roland.htm Cinema With René Laloux, Topor made \\"The Dead Times\\" (Les Temps morts, 1964), \\"The Snails\\" (Les Escargots, 1965) and their most famous work, the feature length La Planète sauvage (1973).https://www.lambiek.net/artists/t/topor_roland.htm Topor also worked as an actor, his most famous part being Renfield in Werner Herzog's Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht (1979). In the same year, he also performed the surrealistic paralyzed boss in the movie Ratataplan by Maurizio Nichetti.The Ratataplan movie webpage in the Maurizio Nichetti's website webpage Theatre Topor variously wrote, directed and designed a number of theatre works. Topor's absurd narratives are rife with macabre ironies, scatologies, and cruelties, which seem intended to shock and reframe human interactions to an insane extent. When Topor's play Joko fête son anniversaire was performed in Brussels in 1972, one critic commented, \\"In some countries, the author would be shot.\\" Topor's play Vinci avait raison (somewhat of a pastiche of J. B. Priestley's 1945 play An Inspector Calls) is set in a house where no one can escape, the toilets are clogged, and excrement becomes evident on stage. It was performed in Brussels in 1977 and caused a scandal.

In that role, he became a central figure in the devastating Galveston hurricane of 1900. The Isaac M. Cline Award, the NWS's highest honor, is named due to his \\"numerous contributions to the mission of the Weather Bureau\\" and is \\"one of the most recognized employees in weather service history.\\" Early life Cline was born near Madisonville, Tennessee on October 13, 1861, to Jacob and Mary Cline. He had a younger brother, Joseph Leander Cline. Cline attended Hiwassee College, then in 1882, joined the meteorology training program of the U.S. Army Signal Corps. Isaac was first assigned to Little Rock, Arkansas in order to take daily readings, as well as to observe the Rocky Mountain locusts and the relationship between their behavior and the climate. The locusts \\"evidently learned that [Isaac] had been put on their trail and disappeared.\\" In his spare time in Little Rock, Isaac earned a Doctor of Medicine from the University of Arkansas. He was then assigned to Fort Concho, then to Abilene, Texas where he met Cora May Bellew, whom he married March 17, 1887.Heidorn, Keith. \\"Dr Isaac M. Cline: A Man of Storm and Floods\\" Galveston In March 1889, a Texas section of the Weather Bureau was being established, and Cline was sent to Galveston to organize and oversee it. Cline stayed with the office when it became part of the U.S. Weather Bureau in the 1891 transfer from the Signal Corps to the Department of Agriculture.\\"Isaac Monroe Cline: 1861 – 1955\\", NOAA Celebrates 200 Years In 1892, Isaac's younger brother, Joseph Cline, also began work as a meteorologist at the Galveston Weather Bureau. During his time in Galveston, aside from running the weather office, Cline also taught Sunday school at his church, was a professor at the local medical college and, in 1896, earned a Doctor of Philosophy degree from Add-Ran Male & Female College, now Texas Christian University. Dr. Isaac Monroe Cline at Home in New Orleans, 1910, by Robert Bledsoe Mayfield =Hurricane of 1900= Cline was the second meteorologist to provide reliable forecasts of freezing weather. He also provided some of the first available flood warnings on the Colorado and Brazos rivers. However, in 1891, he wrote an article in the Galveston Daily News in which he gave his official meteorological opinion that the thought of a hurricane ever doing any serious harm to Galveston was \\"a crazy idea\\". Many residents had called for a seawall to protect the city, but Cline's statement helped to prevent its construction. He was proven tragically wrong on September 8, 1900, when the Galveston Hurricane of 1900 hit the island. Between 6,000 and 12,000 people were killed in what remains the deadliest natural disaster in U.S. history. Cline's wife, Cora, who was pregnant with their fourth child at the time, was one of those who perished in the storm. Cline was nearly drowned, but he managed to survive, as well as to save his youngest daughter, six-year-old Esther Bellew. Cline's brother, Joseph, saved Isaac's other two daughters, 12-year-old Allie May and 11-year-old Rosemary. In his autobiography, Isaac Cline claimed that he had taken it upon himself to travel along the beach and other low-lying areas warning people personally of the storm's approach. It is known that around noon on September 8, he did breach Weather Bureau protocol by making a unilateral decision to issue a hurricane warning without first securing authorization from the Bureau's central office in Washington, D.C.. Cline estimated that thousands of lives were saved because of his decision not to wait for approval. However, no eyewitnesses reported seeing Cline personally warning people along the beach. Writer Erik Larson argued in his book Isaac's Storm that Cline did not warn anyone in Galveston prior to the issuance of his office's hurricane warning. Aftermath Shortly before the destruction of Galveston, the Weather Bureau began establishing regional forecasting centers. The center for the Gulf Coast was initially located in Galveston, with Isaac Cline as chief forecaster; his brother Joseph, a fellow meteorologist, worked for him there. In 1901, the center was moved to New Orleans, Louisiana, and Isaac Cline moved with it. There he developed a stellar reputation over the years, successfully forecasting significant levels of flooding in 1912, 1915 and 1927. In 1927, he published the book Tropical Cyclones, a collection of his research. He was also the chief meteorogist in New Orleans during the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927. In 1934, by that time well respected and highly admired in New Orleans, Cline received an honorary doctorate from Tulane University. WPA Art show in New Orleans, 1941 Cline retired from the Weather Bureau in 1935, remained in New Orleans, and indulged his longtime interest in art, both by painting and by opening an art shop.

In 1501, Simon wrote a letter to the clergy of Perm, asking them to admonish their flock, knyaz, and ruling elite to eradicate idolatry and pagan beliefs among ordinary people. Simon was the responsible for the convocation of the sobors in 1503 and 1504. The Sobor (Council) of 1503 condemned the charging of fees for the ordination of priests as simony, though the practice had been approved by the Moscow Council of 1270 and had been practiced in the Byzantine church for years before that. As a result of the condemnation, Archbishop Gennady of Novgorod was condemned the following year for simony and removed from office.E. E.

The population of the civil parish was 1,851 at the 2011 Census. It is situated between Riddings and Codnor Park. John Wright and William Jessop had purchased the land adjacent to the Cromford Canal from Lancelot Rolleston of Watnall in 1809. The village was notable for its large gardens, and its rural setting. The Mechanics Institute was built in 1846; schools were provided in 1850 and a parish church in 1852. The local authority demolished most of the old village in the late twentieth century. Nearby is Pye Hill and the bend in the Cromford Canal where it turns southward down the Erewash Valley and the junction with its extension to Pinxton. About a quarter of a mile north east is another transport landmark, Pye Bridge at the junction of the Erewash Valley railway line and the extension to Ambergate. Part of the line to Ambergate is now preserved as Midland Railway - Butterley, which terminates just south of the former Pye Bridge Station. The History of Ironville & Codnor Park in a “nutshell” Ironville is possibly Derbyshire’s best example of a mid-nineteenth century model village. The village itself was mainly created between 1834 and 1860 by the Butterley Company to house its iron workers. The model village won much national acclaim, with its large gardens, a rural setting well away from the ironworks and the overall spacious layout compared with other industrial villages. The physical and spiritual welfare of the employees of the Company was reflected not only in the provision of a church and a school by the Company, but also with the provision of a complete range of public services for the village. These included its own gas and water works, a Mechanics' Institute containing an artisans' library and swimming bath. Nearby, but still within the parish of Ironville is Codnor Park formally an ancient Deer Park. At the historically renowned Codnor Park Iron Works (demolished in the 1970’s and now landscaped and planted with native trees), cannonballs were made for Waterloo, armour plate was made for the very first iron-hulled warships such as The Warrior & The Black Prince (circa 1861). During World War II the works also produced sterns for 57 “Loch” class frigates, and 51 large bridges, each with a 150-foot span, which were used for crossing the Rhine and Italian rivers. In addition, the company manufactured tracks for Churchill and Cromwell tanks as well as many other important products for the war effort. The first houses in Codnor Park actually built by the Butterley Company in 1802 for workers at the newly built Lime Works. The row of houses was originally called Measham Row (later Lime Kiln Row) and probably reflects where these workers came from. They would all have walked there or hitched a ride on barges passing along the canal system. This would also apply to all the workers who came to live there in the period 1834 to 1860. Many walked from Wales just to be employed there, not being able to afford train fares etc. Just imagine - a house and a job! They must have thought they were dreaming or heading for the land of plenty! Just imagine what it was like to live in Ironville 100 years ago. A flourishing community: The ironworks at Codnor Park formed part of the famous Butterley Company. During the 19th century the Company became a thriving success. In 1862 there were seven furnaces at Butterley and Codnor Park which produced one-fifth of the total output of iron in Derbyshire. Later in the 19th century the production of ironstone declined locally, but the Company still remained a major force in the iron industry. It was heavily involved in the expansion of the railway industry, by the manufacture of track and wagons at its foundry and engineering works, and the Butterley Company was famously used for the huge arched roof of St Pancras Station in London, one of the wonders of Victorian engineering. Throughout its history the Company was heavily involved with the production of bridges, heavy structural steelwork, mining equipment and machinery, presses, castings and overhead cranes. The development of Codnor Park and Ironville is due to the formation of the Butterley Company and the opening of the Cromford Canal. Before the Codnor Park iron works had been constructed, coal and iron stone had been mined in the area for hundreds of years. Records go back to the De Grey family having coal mines in the area in the fifteenth century. In 1599 Thomas Shorter married Elizabeth Bradway, in Heanor Parish Church. Thomas’s address was given as living “at Codnor Park by the Furnace.” Before Ironville Parish Church was constructed Codnor Park was an 'extra parochial liberty' referring to the fact that the area did not at that time come under any parish. Couples in those days had to travel as far as Heanor, Eastwood and Alfreton to get married. Codnor Park was once part of the Manor and Castle of Codnor and was mentioned in Domesday Book. Close to the village is one of only two medieval castles retaining its original medieval architecture in the whole of the county of Derbyshire, (the only other being Peveril Castle in the Peak District). Codnor Castle has a very rich history and the castle site dates back to the 11th century. The castle was the home and power base for one of medieval England’s most powerful families for 300 years - the De Grey family, also known as the Baron's Grey of Codnor. This medieval fortress was once grand enough to play host to royal visits including that of King Edward II in 1342. The Castle is open to the Public every second Sunday of the month throughout the year. When Channel 4’s Time Team visited they quite literally struck gold. Excavations at Codnor Castle in Derbyshire unearthed a gold coin which presenter Tony Robinson said was one of the most valuable single items ever found on Time Team. Their discoveries revealed far more than anyone ever expected. In the bottom of Codnor Castle’s moat they found a Gold Noble coin which dates back to the time of Henry V and the Battle of Agincourt. Their excavations also uncovered the remains of a massive round tower and one of the first drawbridges ever discovered in the programme’s 15 year history. The village in the nineteenth century boasted its very own brewery, a pottery and a brick works. In the twentieth century there was for a time, an oil well producing 400 gallons of oil per day, (1921). Near to the castle are two well-known local landmarks - the Jessop Memorial & Hall. The monument was built in 1854 by public subscription by Butterley workers as a monument to William Jessop II, son of the founder, who developed the company after the death of his father in 1814. The monument and grounds once upon a time proved to be a popular attraction for Galas, and Sunday school outings and picnics. Whit Monday Band of Hope Fetes were also held there, with local Bands marching through the villages before finally ending up at the monument. The Monument Hall in later years was used as a Rola-Rena. The parishioners of Codnor Park and Ironville can claim to possess one of the most substantial and beautiful monuments to World War I in the county. The unveiling and dedication ceremony was held on 16 November 1923. The engraving and erection of the memorial was carried out by an ex-Service man, Mr. E. Cope, of Riddings. The foundation, which measures 8 feet by 7 feet 6 inches, was laid by the Butterley Company, also the paving from Christ Church’s gateway to the monument. The village is set within excellent countryside surroundings with many wonderful signposted walks and benefits from being only ten minutes from the local town centres of Alfreton and Ripley. Codnor Park Reservoir, built originally to top up the canal is a popular spot for walking and fishing, with good access for disabled anglers, also a haven for a variety of birdlife. Less than two miles to the west of the reservoir is Swanwick Junction, part of the Midland Railway Trust which commemorates one of the major railway companies of its time. It has a superb collection of steam and diesel locomotives which may be seen powering trains on the line or on display in the museum. The Golden Valley Light Railway (GVLR) and Butterley Park Miniature Railway are based here too.

He was the last Foreign Minister in the Taliban government of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. Prior to this, he served as spokesman and secretary to Mullah Mohammed Omar, leader of the Taliban. After the Northern Alliance, accompanied by U.S. and British forces, ousted the regime, Muttawakil surrendered in Kandahar to government troops. In 2005, he announced that he would be a candidate in the elections for the House of the People. Early life Muttawakil is originally from Keshkinakhud in Maywand District, Kandahar Province. He is not known for being a mujahed in the 1980s Soviet invasion, but his father, Abdul Ghafar Barialai, is an extremely famous Pashto poet in southern Afghanistan and was killed during Taraki's rule. He belongs to the Kakar tribe. Reported warning of 9/11 attack According to the BBC, Tohir Yo'ldosh (leader of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan) learned, prior to the attacks, that al Qaeda was planning to use hijacked airliners to attack the United States on September 11, 2001. The BBC reported that Yo'ldosh then informed the Taliban's Foreign Minister, Muttawakil, who sent an envoy to warn the USA of al Qaeda's attack plans prior to September 11, 2001. The reason the BBC offered for Yo'ldosh to initiate an advance warning to the USA of the attacks was that he was concerned that an al Qaeda attack on the USA would trigger an American counter-attack, which would imperil the safe haven his group had been enjoying in Afghanistan. Defection from the Taliban In October 2001, the month following al Qaeda's attacks in the USA, Muttawakil was reported to be in Pakistan. According to the BBC some rumors said he was trying to negotiate an end to the American aerial bombardment of Afghanistan; that he was suggesting the Taliban hand over Bin Laden. Muttawakil was reported to have had a 90-minute meeting with Lieutenant General Ehsan ul Haq, the head of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate. He was rumored to have asked General Haq to lobby United States Secretary of State Colin Powell, that an American ceasefire would allow moderate elements within the Taliban, like Muttawakil, to push Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar to abandon Bin Laden. On Monday October 15, 2001, it was reported that Muttawakil had arrived in the United Arab Emirates in order to defect from the Taliban. UAE officials denied this report. Surrender confirmed The BBC confirmed that Muttawakil had surrendered, after two weeks of negotiation, in early February 2002. Abdullah Abdullah, the minister who held the same portfolio in Hamid Karzai's Afghan Transitional Authority as Muttawakil had held under the Taliban, stated that Muttawakil should stand trial for war crimes. Detention Fazal Mohammad, detained on suspicion of being a former Taliban commander, was released from American custody for medical reasons in mid-2002. *He reported that he had been held in American custody in Kandahar with about 300 other captives, including Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil, and two of his former deputies, Maulawi Khirullah Khairkhwa, and Abdul Hai Mutmaen. *He reported that they were fed starvation rations, and their wounds were left untreated. *He reported that captives were subjected to sexual abuse, and attacks from dogs. The BBC reported, on Wednesday, October 8, 2003, that Muttawakil had recently been released from eighteen months of detention in Bagram, and had returned to his family's home in Kandahar. Muttawakil is reported to have said: On Monday, July 4, 2005 the BBC reported that Muttawakil spent the three years after his surrender in US detention and under Afghan house arrest. Following the end of his house arrest Muttawakil took positions at odds with those of the former Taliban regime. He said he no longer opposed female education, so long as it was consistent with Afghan culture. And he said that supporting Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda had brought suffering to Afghanistan. But he still defended some other aspects of the Taliban's former policies. Disowned by the Taliban On Tuesday October 21, 2003, the Taliban disowned Muttawakil. The BBC was told by a Taliban spokesman that Muttawakil \\"does not represent our will\\". In 2003, Muttawakil's location and status was a matter for speculation. The BBC reported that he had been released from detention from the United States Bagram Theater Detention Facility. The BBC also reports that the US was guarding him, for his own protection, at their base in Kandahar. They report that aides to Muttawakil assert that the USA has given Muttawakil two choices: join the Karzai government as a spokesman and adviser to the Afghan president; or seek political asylum in a Western country. However, the aides said, Muttawakil wanted to take a break from involvement in Afghan politics, and, if he were to seek asylum, he would wish to do so in an Arab country. Present Muttawakil ran for parliamentary elections in September 2005. W.A. Muttawakil's brother Maulvi Jalil Ahmed was for six years a Muslim cleric in the city of Quetta, Pakistan. He was killed during a shooting incident in Quetta in July 2005. =Move to Kabul= An article in the German publication Der Spiegel, on April 12, 2007, about the Taliban's former ambassador to Pakistan, Mullah Abdul Salam Zaeef, said he had moved into a \\"...handsome guest house, located in the dusty modern neighborhood Khosh Hal Khan.\\" The article goes on to state that the new home Karzai's government has provided Zaeef is around the corner from Muttawakil's. Der Spiegel described Zaeef's home as being guarded, inside and out, by a heavily armed security detail. Like Muttawakil, Zaeef is regarded as one of the more moderate former members of the Taliban. Saudi peace talks During Ramadan, 2008, there were rumors that Saudi King Abdullah was attempting to broker peace talks between the warring parties from Afghanistan. Muttawakil, former Taliban Ambassador to Pakistan Abdul Salem Zaeef and former Supreme Court Chief Justice Fazel Hadi Shinwari were among leading Afghan figures who met with King Abdullah. Zaeef acknowledged being invited by Saudi King Abdullah to dine with other leading Afghan figures, from the Karzai government, the Taliban, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-e-Islami and other former members of the Taliban. Zaeef denied this meeting should be characterized as \\"peace talks\\". He stated that none of the individuals at this meeting had been authorized to conduct negotiations. Zaeef denied anyone discussed Afghanistan at this meeting. Sanctions In 1999, the UN Security Council established a sanctions regime to cover individuals and entities associated with Al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden and/or the Taliban. Since the US Invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, the sanctions were applied to individuals and organizations in all parts of the world, also targeting former members of the Taliban government. Muttawakil was added to this list in 2001 . On January 27, 2010, a United Nations sanctions committee removed him as well as four other former senior Taliban officials from this list, in a move favoured by Afghan President Karzai. The decision means he and the four others would no longer be subject to an international travel ban, assets freeze and arms embargo.\\"U.N.

The shapes are constrained by the PDM (point distribution model) Statistical Shape Model to vary only in ways seen in a training set of labelled examples. The shape of an object is represented by a set of points (controlled by the shape model). The ASM algorithm aims to match the model to a new image. Operation of the shape model The ASM works by alternating the following steps: * Generate a suggested shape by looking in the image around each point for a better position for the point. This is commonly done using what is called a \\"profile model\\", which looks for strong edges or uses the Mahalanobis distance to match a model template for the point. * Conform the suggested shape to the point distribution model, commonly called a \\"shape model\\" in this context. The figure to the right shows an example. The technique has been widely used to analyse images of faces, mechanical assemblies and medical images (in 2D and 3D). It is closely related to the active appearance model. It is also known as a \\"Smart Snakes\\" method, since it is an analog to an active contour model which would respect explicit shape constraints.

A love partner of Pablo Picasso, Dora Maar was depicted in a number of Picasso's paintings, including his Portrait of Dora Maar.  Biography  Henriette Theodora Markovitch was the only daughter of Josip Marković (aka Joseph Markovitch) (1874–1969), a Croatian architect who studied in Zagreb, Vienna, and then Paris where he settled in 1896, and of his spouse, Catholic-raised Louise-Julie Voisin (1877–1942), originally from Cognac, France. Portrait of Dora Maar, by Pablo Picasso In 1910, the family left for Buenos Aires where the father obtained several commissions including for the embassy of Austria-Hungary. His achievements earned him the honor of being decorated by Emperor Francis Joseph I, even though he was \\"the only architect who did not make a fortune in Buenos Aires\\". In 1926, the family returned to Paris. Dora Maar, a pseudonym she chose, took courses at the Central Union of Decorative Arts and the School of Photography. She also enrolled at the École des Beaux-Arts and the Académie Julian which had the advantage of offering the same instruction to women as to men. Dora Maar frequented André Lhote's workshop where she met Henri Cartier- Bresson. While studying at the École des Beaux-Arts, Maar met fellow female surrealist Jacqueline Lamba. About her, Maar said, 'I was closely linked with Jacqueline. She asked me, “where are those famous surrealists?\\" and I told her about cafe de la Place Blanche.' Jacqueline then began to frequent the cafe where she would eventually meet André Breton, whom she would later marry. When the workshop ceased its activities, Dora Maar left Paris, alone, for Barcelona and then London, where she photographed the effects of the economic depression following the Wall Street Crash of 1929 in the United States. On her return, and with the help of her father, she opened another workshop at 29 rue d'Astorg in the 8th arrondissement of Paris. In 1935 she was introduced to Pablo Picasso and she became his companion and his muse. She took pictures in his studio at the Grands Augustins and tracked the latter stages of his epic work, Guernica. She later acted as a model for his piece titled Monument à Apollinaire, a tribute to the late poet Guillaume Apollinaire.  Dora Maar the photographer  Maar's earliest surviving photographs were taken in the early 1920s with a Rolleiflex camera while on a cargo ship going to the Cape Verde Islands. At the beginning of 1930, she set up a photography studio on rue Campagne-Première (14th arrondissement of Paris) with Pierre Kéfer, photographer, and decorator for Jean Epstein's 1928 film, The Fall of the House of Usher. In the studio, Maar and Kefer worked together mostly on commercial photography for advertisements and fashion magazines. Her father assisted with her finances in this period of her life as she was establishing herself while trying to earn a living. She met the photographer Brassaï with whom she shared the darkroom in the studio. Brassai once said that she had “bright eyes and an attentive gaze, a disturbing stare at times”. During this time working in advertising and fashion photography, the influence of Surrealism could be seen in her work through her heavy use of mirrors and contrasting shadows . She felt that art should represent the content of reality through links with intuitions or ideas, rather than visually reproduce the natural. Dora Maar also met Louis-Victor Emmanuel Sougez, a photographer working for advertising, archeology and artistic director of the newspaper L'Illustration, whom she considered a mentor. In 1932, she had an affair with the filmmaker Louis Chavance. Dora Maar frequented the \\"October group\\", formed around Jacques Prévert and Max Morise after their break from surrealism. Maar had her first publication in the magazine Art et Métiers Graphiques in 1932. Her first solo exhibition was held at the Galerie Vanderberg in Paris. It is the gelatin silver works of the surrealist period that remain the most sought after by admirers: Portrait of Ubu (1936), 29 rue d'Astorg, black and white, collages, photomontages or superimpositions.(fr)Arago, Dora Maar The photograph represents the central character in a popular series of plays by Alfred Jarry called Ubu Roi. The work was first shown at the Exposition Surréaliste d’objets at the Galerie Charles Ratton in Paris and at the International Surrealist Exhibition in London in 1936.Dillon, Brian,The Voraciousness and Oddity of Dora Maar’s Pictures, The New Yorker, 21 May 2019, with many images She also participated in Participates in Fantastic Art, Dada, Surrealism, at the MoMA in New York the same year. Surrealist concepts and interests often aligned with the ideas of the political left of the time and so Maar became very politically active at this point in her life. After the fascist demonstrations of 6 February 1934, in Paris along with René Lefeuvre, Jacques Soustelle, supported by Simone Weil and Georges Bataille, she signed the tract \\"Appeal to the Struggle\\" written at the initiative of André Breton. Much of her work is highly influenced by leftist politics of the time, often depicting those who had been thrown into poverty by the Depression. She was part of an ultra-leftist association called “Masses”, where she first met Georges Bataille, an anti-fascist organization called the Union of Intellectuals Against Fascism, and a radical collective of left-wing actors and writers called October. She also was involved in many Surrealist groups and often participated in demonstrations, convocations, and cafe conversations. She signed many manifestos, including one titled \\"When Surrealists were Right\\" in August 1935 which concerned the Congress of Paris, which had been held in March of that year. In 1935 she took a photo of fashion illustrator and designer Christian Berard that was described by writer and critic Michael Kimmelman as “wry and mischievous with only his head perceived above the fountain as if he were John the Baptist on a silver platter”. In the 1980s she made a number of photograms. Relationship with Pablo Picasso Dora Maar first saw Pablo Picasso at the end of 1935 when she was taking promotional shots on the set of the Jean Renoir film The Crime of Monsieur Lange. She was captivated by him, but they did not formally meet. Maar was introduced to Picasso a few days later by their mutual friend Paul Eluard at Cafe des Deux Magots. The story of their first encounter was told by the writer Jean-Paul Crespelle, \\"the young woman serious face, lit up by pale blue eyes which looked all the paler because of her thick eyebrows; a sensitive uneasy face, with light and shade passing alternately over it. She kept driving a small pointed pen-knife between her fingers into the wood of the table. Sometimes she missed and a drop of blood appeared between the roses embroidered on her black gloves... Picasso would ask Dora to give him the gloves and would lock them up in the showcase he kept for his mementos.\\" Picasso was intrigued by Dora's seductive and masochistic behaviour, which served as inspiration for many of his works throughout their relationship. Their liaison would last nearly nine years, during which time Picasso did not end his relationship with Marie-Thérèse Walter, mother of his daughter Maya. Dora Maar photographed the successive stages of the creation of Guernica, painted by Picasso in his studio in the rue des Grands-Augustins from May to June 1937; Picasso used these photographs in his creative process. She was Picasso's principal model, and he often represented her in tears. Dora Maar as \\"The Weeping Woman\\" Dora Maar is very well known for her role as Picasso's lover, subject, and muse. As such, he painted many portraits of her. In the majority of these paintings, Dora Maar was represented as a tortured, anguished woman. The most well known of these portraits is “The Weeping Woman”. Picasso was very inspired by the tragedies of the Spanish Civil War, and he thought of Dora Maar as a living depiction of the pain and suffering that people experienced during this time. Dora did not appreciate Picasso's depiction of her in this way. When asked about his portraits of her, she said “all portraits of me are lies. They’re Picassos. Not one is Dora Maar” Her liaison with Picasso, who physically abused her and made her fight Marie- Therese Walter for his love, ended in 1943, although they met again episodically until 1946. Thus, on 19 March 1944, she played the role of Fat Anguish in the reading, at the home of Michel Leiris, of Picasso' first play, Desire Caught by the Tail, led by Albert Camus. In 1944, through the intermediary of Paul Éluard, Dora Maar met Jacques Lacan, who took care of her nervous breakdown by administering her electroshocks, which were forbidden at the time. Picasso bought her a house in Ménerbes, Vaucluse, where she retired and lived alone. She turned to the Catholic religion, met the painter Nicolas de Staël (who lived in the same village), and turned to abstract painting.  Dora Maar the painter  The painted works of Dora Maar remained unrecognized until their posthumous sale, organized in 1999, which made the public and professionals discover a very personal production that had never left her studio. Dora Maar abandoned photography for painting alongside leaving Picasso and his influence, or rather the crushing presence of the painter, who had imposed on her a cubistic style. Pushed by Picasso to express herself in this style, one can wonder about Picasso's desire to remove his lover from the domain where she excelled, and to constrain her in a style of painting which he had long mastered. It was from the painful separation of Picasso that Dora Maar truly became a painter. Tragic figurative works, such as the Portrait of Eluard, or Self-Portrait to The Child of 1946, translate, in dark tones, the pain of post-war years. After years of struggling with depression, Dora Maar confined herself within her own memories. It is between the 1960s and 70s that there was the beginning of a respite when she experimented with abstract formats in shimmering colors. It was in the 1980s, though that the painter expressed herself fully in her many paintings of the Luberon region. Paintings of the landscapes around her house in Ménerbes, showed locations dominated by wind and clouds, strongly revealing the struggle of an artist with the ghosts of her past.  Death Maar spent her last years in her apartment in Rue de Savoie, in the Left Bank of Paris. She died on 16 July 1997, at 89 years old. She was buried in the Bois-Tardieu cemetery in Clamart.(fr) Le Monde.fr, Harry Bellet, \\"Marseille rend justice aux talents de Dora Maar\\", 14.04.2002 (exert) Her experiments with photograms and dark-room photography were only found posthumously.  Legacy  Although Maar is mostly remembered as one of Picasso's lovers, there have been many recent exhibits presenting her as an artist in her own right, including exhibitions at the Haus der Kunst, Munich, 13 October 2001 – 6 January 2002; the Centre de la Vieille Charité, Marseille, 20 January – 4 May 2002; the Centre Cultural Tecla Sala, Barcelona, 15 May – 15 July 2002; the Centre Pompidou, Paris, 5 June 2019 – 29 July 2019; and the Tate Modern, London, 20 November 2019 – 15 March 2020. Maar was played by Samantha Colley in the 2018 season of Genius, which focuses on the life and art of Picasso.

She first appeared on the music scene was as a member of Patti LaBelle & The Bluebelles. Dash has worked as a singer, songwriter, session musician, and sideman for bands that include LaBelle, The Rolling Stones, and Keith Richards. Biography=Early career= Born in Trenton, New Jersey,Urciuoli, Brielle. \\"Sarah Dash of Labelle talks at TCNJ about her Trenton roots\\", The Times, September 24, 2014. Accessed January 9, 2015. \\"Musician and Trenton native Sarah Dash lectures at The College of New Jersey in Ewing on Wednesday, September 24, 2014.\\" she moved to Philadelphia in the mid-1960s where she got reacquainted with fellow adopted Philadelphian Nona Hendryx and Philadelphia natives Patricia \\"Patsy\\" Holte (AKA Patti LaBelle) and Sundray Tucker. In 1961, following the break-up of a rival girl group, Hendryx and Dash joined Holte and Tucker in \\"The Ordettes\\". In 1961, Tucker was replaced by Philadelphia-born Cindy Birdsong and the quartet became The Bluebelles in 1962. The group changed their name again to Patti LaBelle and the Bluebelles after Holte was advised to adapt the stage name of Patti Labelle. Among the Bluebelles hits including the doo-wop classic, \\"I Sold My Heart to the Junkman\\" and doo-wop-esque R&B; ballads \\"You'll Never Walk Alone\\" and \\"Danny Boy\\", the top forty classic, \\"Down the Aisle\\", the soul standard \\"All or Nothing\\" and their now-legendary rendition of \\"Over the Rainbow\\", which LaBelle later transformed into a tour-de-force in her 1981 solo cover. Dash sings with a sharp soprano. =Labelle= In 1967, Birdsong left the group to join The Supremes and four years later, The Bluebelles changed their name to Labelle and began recording material that set them apart from other girl groups including songs of political, social and sexual matters transforming them into a \\"hard-rocking, sexually and politically-outspoken group\\". Much like The Supremes' Mary Wilson, Dash was often the \\"middle\\" of two of the group's extremes, Nona Hendryx and Patti LaBelle, who often had differed in the group's change of direction before LaBelle eventually agreed to \\"go along with it\\". After a tour of England where they changed managers hiring Vicki Wickham, in 1971, the group ditched their bouffant wigs and dresses for Afros and jeans releasing transitional records such as Labelle (which included the Hendryx-penned sexual \\"Morning Much Better\\") and Moon Shadow (which featured the group's gospel-fueled renditions of the Pete Townshend penned, \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\", and Cat Stevens' \\"Moonshadow\\"). During this period, the group got notice by the mainstream after opening for blue-eyed soul singer- songwriter Laura Nyro and British rock group The Who during their tours, leading up to the 1973 release of Pressure Cookin', which featured more songwriting from Hendryx and a more unified group effort in which Dash sung co-lead on including the group's memorable ballad, \\"Can I Speak to You Before You Go to Hollywood?\\", where Dash sings most of the song with Hendryx singing in the beginning and LaBelle bringing up the rear near the end of the song. Dash was a major vocal force for the group. Dash's strong vocals in the group provided for balance and stability when LaBelle and Hendryx occasionally went off on vocal tangents or were pulling audience members up onto the stage to dance. Dash also functioned as songwriter for several songs. It also marked a political consciousness in the choice of cover songs and lyrics chosen on original compositions. One song, for example, was a medley of psychedelic styled \\"Something in the Air\\", a mixture of a Townshend inspired album of songs written by a roadie, John \\"Speedy\\" Keen, who had written a track on his band's album, The Who Sell Out, and \\"The Revolution Will Not Be Televised\\" by African-American activist, Gil Scott-Heron. Despite the group's cult raves of their early material, their critical success didn't translate to commercial acclaim until the releases of 1974's Nightbirds (which featured the group's biggest smash single of their careers, \\"Lady Marmalade\\") and 1975's Phoenix. Following the release of 1976's Chameleon and a 1977 tour, the group agreed to split after the trio failed to come to terms with material (the group were working on an album titled Shaman when they split) and had finally \\"rocked and rolled themselves out\\". =Solo career= In 1978, Dash released her self- titled debut album, which included the top-ten disco hit, \\"Sinner Man\\". She also performed vocals on several ballads, notably \\"You,\\" and \\"We're Lovers After All,\\" and \\"I Can't Believe Someone Like You Could Really Love Me,\\" (with a full gospel choir backing); she also had another minor disco hit with \\"(Come and Take) This Candy from Your Baby\\". Dash enjoyed much success and television and public appearances with \\"Sinner Man.\\" At this time, she was asked to compose and sing \\"For The Love of You\\" (the theme song for the 1980s PBS show Watch Your Mouth) and \\"Bringing It All Home.\\" She also guest-starred on an episode of Watch Your Mouth, playing a fictional character, a super diva with an attitude, \\"Tessie Bright\\". However, on the Kirshner albums, and especially Ooh La La, Sarah Dash, (1980) she was given substandard material to work with, although she wrote \\"I Feel Good Being Me\\" for this album. It featured one disco track, \\"Ooh La La, Too Soon,\\" which was used in a Sassoon jeans commercial, and Phyllis Hyman provided backing vocals to the album. After releasing one more album Close Enough, for Kirshner, which features ballads such as \\"Somebody's Angel\\" and \\"God Bless You,\\" and the rocker, \\"Paradise,\\" Dash left Kirshner for other opportunities. In 1983, Dash released two dance singles for Megatone Records in San Francisco, both produced by Patrick Cowley. The first, \\"Low Down Dirty Rhythm\\" was basically ignored, but the second single \\"Lucky Tonight\\" (featuring background vocals by Sylvester), was much more successful, even rising to the #5 spot on Billboard's Dance Chart, and was even a Billboard \\"Pick of the Week.\\" Dash's next endeavor was the recording she made on the Rap record, Satisfaction, for High Fidelity Three in 1985. Also during this time, Dash did session work for The O'Jays, Nile Rodgers of Chic (duetting on a ballad with Rodgers, \\"My Love Song for You\\" from, The Adventures in the Land of the Good Groove), The Marshall Tucker Band, and David Johansen. In the later 1980s, she teamed up with musician Dr. York for the duet \\"It's Too Late\\" (for which York took out advertisement space on the cover of Billboard magazine, to little success). Then in 1988 she was signed to Manhattan Records, (via EMI) and released the album entitled You're All I Need. This set included a title track duet with Patti Labelle; a further duet \\"Don't Make Me Wait\\" with Ray, Goodman & Brown; and \\"To Tell You The Truth\\". It was met with only moderate success, and Dash has not recorded an album since. Subsequently, Dash released a little-noticed dance single in 1990, \\"When You Talk to Me/ Manhandled,\\" with Disc jockey Jellybean Benitez. A dance music single with gospel lyrics called \\"Hold On (He'll Be Right There),\\" produced by Jason King and Gavin Bradley, was released in 2012. Reunited with the Rolling Stones In 1988, Keith Richards invited Dash to accompany him on tour: her association with him led to another world tour, a tour with Richards' X-pensive Winos, appearances on two of his albums, and on The Rolling Stones' Steel Wheels album in 1989. With Richards, she guested on Live at the Hollywood Palladium in 1988, and Main Offender, in 1992. In the early 1990s, Sarah developed her own one-woman show, \\"Dash of Diva,\\" performing at different club venues, as well as doing a more jazz-flavored set that resulted in various appearances. In 1995, she reunited with Patti Labelle and Nona Hendryx to record the track \\"Turn It Out\\" for the movie soundtrack, To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar, garnering a No. 1 dance music hit in the process. Also in 1988, Dash was asked to add her backing vocals to the Rolling Stones' Steel Wheels album, which eventually led to a tour with her old friend Keith Richards. They became close when Dash was still performing with Patti Labelle and The Blue Bells, who opened for Stones in the early 1960s. She recorded the duet \\"Make No Mistake\\" with him, and she took the lead vocal on \\"Time Is on My Side\\", showcasing her powerful delivery and vocal range, which, Keith has said in his autobiography, is 'the best version of that song he's ever heard'. She also recorded as lead vocalist for \\"Rock Awhile\\". For his next album, Dash wrote and sang another track, \\"Body Talk\\". Another highlight during her tour with Richards was her singing the female vocal on \\"Gimme Shelter.\\" Dash starts the song with her silvery \\"Oohs' and then cuts loose on her solo in the middle of the song. Another contribution is only available on the Keith Richards song \\"Eileen\\", a CD single from his album Main Offender on the Virgin Records label. In 1992, Dash added her background vocals on the collaboration between Bo Diddley and Ronnie Wood's Live at the Ritz album. =Later career and Labelle reunion= Lately, Dash has made a few guest appearances on albums, including Temptation and Persuasions' cut \\"Greener.\\" From time to time, she also does jazz/blues shows in small clubs on the east coast. Sarah took a break to work on her autobiography, Dash of Diva. She decided with her friend and confidante Pam Johnson scripted excerpts and wrote a musical with the same title debut at The Cross Roads Theater in New Brunswick. =Charity work= Dash received a citation from the deputy Mayor of New York City, Ruth Messinger, for her work and efforts in the underprivileged New York City community, where she raised funds for homeless single women with children. With her generous time, Dash collected donations and funds she acquired for these mothers and their children which included clothing, toys, books, after-school activities, excursions to amusement parks, theater in the parks, and food. Reunited Labelle with a cause The biggest news for Dash and her fans lately is that Labelle, having reunited for television a few times over the years and sporadic recordings, recorded in January 2006, a tribute to civil rights leader Rosa Parks tentatively titled, \\"Dear Rosa.\\" In 2008, the long-awaited new album from Labelle founders; Patti Labelle, Nona Hendryx & Sarah Dash, Back to Now, was released to rave reviews. Dash sings Lead vocals in the group's political song, \\"System\\", which featured LaBelle and Hendryx singing side by side to Dash in autotone, resurrecting songs that didn't make the final cut from earlier recordings, including Cole Porter's composition, \\"Miss Otis Regrets\\" amongst other songs. Dash's voice had taken a while to return after an injury on the New York City Subway and hospitalization, but she recovered her voice by the time of the recording. Producers on the project included rock superstar Lenny Kravitz, hip hop icon Wyclef Jean, plus legendary classic Philadelphia soul writer/producers Kenny Gamble & Leon Huff. Dash headlined for a month in the San Francisco Cirque du Soleil influenced Teatro Zinzanni and performed at the 2007 Lesbian, Bisexual, Gay, Transgender parade. She was also busy at work on a gospel album at the time. Dash was honored by her hometown of Trenton, New Jersey, by being the grand marshal in the annual Thanksgiving Day Parade. The parade was held on Saturday November 22, 2008. The honor was presented to Dash during a time when her hometown of Trenton is at a point where morale is at an all-time low and violent crimes such as murder have reached an all-time high. The hope is that such honors will spark encouragement in the city and show that people from Trenton can reach a measure of success with hard work. It was announced in 2012 that Dash plans to release a full-length gospel album. She released a ballad from the album called \\"I'm Still Here\\" in late 2011, and a dance music single \\"Hold On (He'll Be Right There),\\" in May 2012.

It is a medical test that is done to aid diagnosis of liver disease, to assess the severity of known liver disease, and to monitor the progress of treatment. Medical uses Liver biopsy is often required for the diagnosis of a liver problem (jaundice, abnormal blood tests) where blood tests, such as hepatitis A serology, have not been able to identify a cause. It is also required if hepatitis is possibly the result of medication, but the exact nature of the reaction is unclear. Alcoholic liver disease and tuberculosis of the liver may be diagnosed through biopsy. Direct biopsy of tumors of the liver may aid the diagnosis, although this may be avoided if the source is clear (e.g. spread from previously known colorectal cancer). Liver biopsy will likely remain particularly important in the diagnosis of unexplained liver disease. Non-invasive tests for liver fibrosis in alcoholic, nonalcoholic and viral liver diseases are likely to become more widely used. If the diagnosis is already clear, such as chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis C, liver biopsy is useful to assess the severity of the associated liver damage. The same is true for haemochromatosis (iron overload), although it is frequently omitted. Primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis may require biopsy, although other diagnostic modalities have made this less necessary. Occasionally, liver biopsy is required to monitor the progress of treatment, such as in chronic viral hepatitis. It is an effective way to measure changes in the Ishak fibrosis score. For the last century liver biopsy has been considered as the gold standard for assessing the stage and the grade of chronic liver disease. Consensus conference statements recommended liver biopsy in the management of almost all patients with hepatitis C and B. Biopsy results show significant variability (up to 40% for fibrosis diagnosis) which can lead to a wrong diagnosis. The result depends on the representativity of the punctured sample. Only 5% of patients at risk of fibrosis have liver biopsy. In 2002, the consensus conferences in France and in the USA raised the possibility of treating patients with chronic hepatitis without liver biopsy. These conferences also underlined the necessity of developing reliable non- invasive tests that might be an alternative to liver biopsy both in hepatitis B and C. Risk Liver biopsy is generally a safe procedure, but it is invasive. Complications of liver biopsy are rare but potentially lethal. The majority of complications (60%) occur within two hours, and 96% occur within 24 hours following the procedure. Approximately 2–3% of patients undergoing liver biopsy require hospitalization for the management of an adverse event. Thirty percent of patients experience significant pain during the procedure. Significant bleeding after a liver biopsy occurs in 1–2 out of 100 patients who are biopsied. Bleeding usually becomes apparent within three to four hours. It often stops on its own, but if it persists, a blood transfusion may be needed. Surgery or angiography (a procedure in which the bleeding site is identified and treated) may be required if the bleeding is severe or does not stop on its own. Intraperitoneal hemorrhage is the most serious consequence of bleeding. Fatal complications have been reported in up to 0.01–0.3% of biopsied patients. Procedure and variants A small quantity of tissue is sampled from the liver when doing a biopsy, which is then examined under a microscope Liver biopsies may be taken percutaneously (via a needle through the skin), transvenously (through the blood vessels), endoscopically (through endoscopic ultrasound fine needle biopsy), or directly during abdominal surgery. The sample is examined by microscope, and may be processed further by immunohistochemistry, determination of iron and copper content, and microbiological culture if tuberculosis is suspected For a percutaneous biopsy, it is recommended to use a Birmingham gauge 16 or wider cutting needle, and obtaining a length of 20–25 mm of liver tissue. The presence of 10–12 portal tracts within the specimen is considered sufficient for reliable analysis, ensuring that architectural relationships between structures are maintained. History The first liver aspirate was performed by the German physician Paul Ehrlich in 1883. Percutaneous liver biopsy was first reported in the 1920s. The transjugular approach was pioneered by radiologist Charles Dotter in the 1970s. Non-invasive alternatives Non-invasive alternatives to liver biopsy include both functional staging (quantitative liver function tests) and determination of fibrosis from non-invasive tests. These latter tests are described below and share the disadvantage of estimating fibrosis rather than function. Functional staging has the advantage of evaluating the whole liver and directly measuring hepatic function that determines many clinical outcomes. The ability to predict clinical outcomes is the best proof of the value of a clinical test. Quantitative hepatic function tests were better than combinations of routine blood tests and Ishak fibrosis score in predicting clinical outcomes. The best of these were the perfused hepatic mass (PHM) by quantitative liver spleen scan (QLSS) and oral Cholate clearance and shunt. The QLSS measurement of spleen volume per ideal body weight was nearly as good.Gregory T Everson, Mitchell L Shiffman, John C Hoefs, Timothy R Morgan, Richard K Sterling, David A Wagner, Shannon Lauriski, Teresa M Curto, Anne Stoddard, Elizabeth C Wright Quantitative liver function tests improve the prediction of clinical outcomes in chronic hepatitis C: results from the Hepatitis C Antiviral Long-term Treatment Against Cirrhosis Trial. 2011 Hepatology 55(4):1019-29 Multiphasic MRI is useful in diagnosing various types of liver lesions such as hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, hepatocellular adenoma, focal nodular hyperplasia, and hemangioma. FibroTest (FibroSure in the USA) and FibroMax are non-invasive tests using a blood sample and an algorithm. The test results correspond to stages F0-F4 and grades A0-A3 of the METAVIR scoring system.http://www.oneliver.com/scientific- publications.html In 2007 FibroTest was validated by French Health Authorities as a first-line diagnosis of liver injury before biopsy. It was recommended to be a better predictor than biopsy staging for hepatitis C complications and death. FibroScan is a type of ultrasound machine that uses transient elastography to measure liver stiffness. Its diagnostic performance for fibrosis is similar to that of methods based on serologic markers. Combined use of Fibroscan and Fibrotest could avoid a liver biopsy in most patients with chronic hepatitis C. Other ultrasonic techniques used to characterize liver stiffness include Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) Imaging. Hepascore is a blood test developed in Australia combining the following clinical and laboratory variables: age, gender, bilirubin, GGT, hyaluronic acid, alpha 2 macroglobin to create a score. The test has been validated for patients with hepatitis B, hepatitis C and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. APRI is a quick serum biomarker for fibrosis assessment from Italy. This simple index is made up of routine laboratory tests. The test has not been validated by Health Authorities. 50% of the results are unclassifiable. APRI may be useful for excluding significant fibrosis in hepatitis C.

Because form factors like ATX and connectors such as IDE, SATA, PCI, and PCI Express are industry-wide standards, a whole range of cases, motherboards, CPUs, hard disk drives, RAM and other parts can be obtained individually at many computer shops and assembled at home with a minimum of tools and technical skill. Alternatively, the shop itself may assemble components into a complete machine at a modest additional cost. Similarly, the less-common term \\"whitebook\\" denotes a notebook computer assembled from off-the-shelf parts. Computer professionals and intensive computer users (especially game players) often prefer white box computers constructed with higher quality components that they specify, as opposed to lower cost generic components often found in general purpose PCs. For these users, performance, longevity, expansion capability, and compatibility with non-Windows operating systems take precedence over achieving the absolute lowest cost through the use of the cheapest possible components. In 2002, around 30% of personal computers sold annually were white box systems.

St. Columb alone by default refers to the nearby St. Columb Major. At one time St Columb Minor used to be the main settlement in the area, but it has now been encroached upon by its larger neighbour Newquay. The National School in the Square was built in 1842. It is on the site of the Parsonage and is now used as a Men's Institute. While still an ecclesiastical parish St Columb Minor is no longer a civil parish, forming part of Newquay CP. Parish Church Double Stiles Cross The western end of the church and yard is in view of the Trevelgue clifftop twin tumuli, known locally as The Barrows. It is sheltered from the strong winds of the Atlantic and looks down the Rialton Valley and across to Castle-an-Dinas on the summit of Castle Downs. Local legend has it that the Celtic missionaries, centuries before the Columba legend arose, drove away the evil spirits and replaced pagan magic by Christian worship, and erected a wooden sanctuary. The church-town lay to the west and south while the shelving ground to the north and east prevented building. Hence, as in the case of so many villages, development in the 20th century extended further from the parish church, in this case towards Porth Bean and Henver Roads, leading into Newquay. As of 1896 there were a Cornish cross and four cross bases in the parish: the cross is at Cross Close and is unusual in being almost circular in section. This cross, known as Double Stiles or Three Stiles Cross was moved to a new position when a housing estate was built in 1954. A cross formerly at Lavethan, Blisland, was sold in 1991 and set up in a cottage garden in Newquay.Langdon, A. G. (1896) Old Cornish Crosses. Truro: Joseph Pollard; pp. 39-40Langdon, A. G.

Camp Iguana originally held three child detainees, who camp spokesmen then claimed were the only detainees under age 16 (the age at which DOD defined minors). It was closed in the winter of 2004 when the three were sent back to their native countries. When the Department of Defense was forced in 2005 by US District Court Judge Jed Rakoff's court order to release the identities of all the detainees, DOD acknowledged it had detained up to twenty minors (under the age of 18, the international coming of age) in the adult portion of the prison. In 2005 Camp Iguana was re-opened to hold some of the 38 detainees classified in Combatant Status Review Tribunals as \\"no longer enemy combatants.\\" These included several Uyghurs, who could not return to China because of the high risk of persecution there. They were subject to delays in resettlement as diplomatic efforts tried to place them in countries other than their country of origin or the United States.

The Geneva Conventions entitle persons captured during warfare to a \\"prompt, open tribunal\\" for a fair determination of their status—whether they should be considered civilians, POWs, or enemy combatants. Critics have said a more thorough review at the beginning would have meant the juveniles would never have been transported from Afghanistan. The executive branch of the United States government claimed at the time that enemy combatants were beyond the jurisdiction of the US courts. The United States Supreme Court overruled executive efforts to keep the enemy combatants outside the US judicial system; in decisions in 2004, it ruled that both American and foreign detainees had the right to challenge their detentions before an impartial tribunal. The executive branch established Combatant Status Review Tribunals in 2004 to evaluate whether detainees were enemy combatants.

Adrano (), ancient Adranon, is a town and comune in the province of Catania on the east coast of Sicily. It is situated around northwest of Catania, which is also the capital of the province to which Adrano belongs. It lies near the foot of Mount Etna, at the confluence of the Simeto and Salso rivers. It is the commercial center for a region where olives and citrus fruit are grown. Neighbouring towns include: Biancavilla, Bronte, Paternò, Randazzo, Santa Maria di Licodia and Centuripe. History=Founding and pre-Christian era= The settlement was founded by Dionysius the Elder around 400 BC, intending to strengthen Syracusan power in the region. He named the town Adranon in honour of Adranus, a deity of Phoenician origin. In 344 BC the troops of Timoleon fought the forces of the Syracusan commander Iketas of Leontini near Adrano. During the following years, Adrano was frequently harried by Campanian mercenaries, called the Mamertinians. The Romans conquered the growing township in 263 BCDiodorus Siculus, Biblioteca Historica, 23.4 and declared it a civitas stipendiaria, obliging it to pay a costly tribute to Rome. The consul Valerius ravaged the town, enslaved the inhabitants and sold them as workers and slaves to the aratores (farmers) residing in the near city of Centuripe. In 137 BC, Eunus led an unsuccessful slave revolt against the Roman suppressors, and from then on, Adrano was nothing more than part of Centuripe. The Romans referred to the city as AdranumAdrano - Britannica Online Encyclopedia or Hadranum. = Byzantine Empire, Arabs and Normans = The township was pillaged several times by Germanic tribes during the fall of the Western Roman Empire. Only through the reign of Theodoric the Great (495–526), the conditions improved due to the administration by Cassiodorus. In the mid-6th century it was conquered by the Eastern Roman Empire. Around 950, the Arab Musa occupied the city of Centuripe and its vicinity, and thenceforth Adrano became part of the emirate of Sicily. The ruined town of slaves meanwhile was little more than a settlement of various primitive shacks, but the Islamic occupants, who showed themselves very skillful farmers and quite tolerant towards the Sicilians, build up a functioning infrastructure around Adrano. Several of their buildings and structures, like the Ponte dei Saraceni (Bridge of the Saracens) can still be visited around the region. The Arabs ruled the region until in 1075 the Normans, led by Hugo of Yersey, succeeded in conquering the region against the resistance of Caid Albucazar. Adrano became part of the Diocese of Catania, administered by the monk Ansgerius. The citizens of the prospering township continued the successful agricultural and economic work the Arabs had initiated. Therefore, the Norman era was enormously influenced by winegrowing, leather work and silk manufacturing. =Late Middle Ages and feudalism= The arrival of the Hohenstaufen around the end of the 12th century brought enduring difficulties and disputes over Sicily and its inhabitants. The remaining Arabs were vehemently pursued by the administration, which forced them to gather inside the fortresses of Troina, Entella and Centuripe, offering armed resistance. The insurrection was ended violently, and the survivors were massacred or kidnapped. Pope Clement IV made Charles of Anjou king of Sicily in 1265, which ended the Hohenstaufen rule of southern Italy. During that time, Adrano was rather a small settlement of hunters, and the number of inhabitants had decreased from 1,000 to 300. In 1282, the Sicilian Vespers ended the French reign in Sicily, and Peter III of Aragon became king. The following years were characterized by constant conflicts between the residing farmers and the Bourgeoisie of the region. Adrano fell to the property of the Catalan landholder Garzia de Linguida, and eventually, in 1286, to the ownership of Luca Pellegrino. The estates and soils of the region were subject to immense disputes between several landowners and noblemen in the following time until the 15th century. From the 15th century on, Sicily was reigned by the so-called vice kings. Between 1412 and 1515, Adrano was under administration by the Moncada family. Giovan Tommaso Moncada (1466–1501) renovated the Norman castle and fortified it. He allowed a couple of refugees from the northern Greek region of Epirus to settle down in the vicinity of Adrano, which is how the town of Biancavilla was founded. The relatives of earl Moncada build many manors (so-called palazzi) in the centre of the town, among which is the latter town hall, and the centre of the city, the piazza, became popular meeting place for the residents, who meanwhile numbered around 6,000. Around the same time began the construction of the Monastero di Santa Lucia (Monastery of St Lucy). In 1693, a severe earthquake inflicted heavy damage to the town. = 18th, 19th and 20th century = Since the beginning of the 18th century and until around 1820, Adrano suffered from enduring riots and changes taking place in Italy and particularly Sicily, as was the Risorgimento. Adrano became the main administrative town of the vicinity in 1819 and hosted the local court. Giuseppe Garibaldi landed in Sicily in 1860 and many reforms took place. On July 1, 1860, a town council was installed in Adrano, and don Lorenzo Ciancio was made chairman. The famous Teatro Bellini (Bellini theatre) dates from that time and testifies to the various diversifications the city underwent in that very period. A hospital was instituted as well, and meanwhile Adrano was considered the wealthiest town in the region. In the 1920s, the reformist preacher don Vincenzo Bascetta appeared in Adrano, and, together with the young anti-fascist high school teacher Carmelo Salanitro, he passionately fought for the peasants' rights. Due to their initiative, large parts of the surrounding lava landscape were transformed into olive and almond plantations. Carmelo Salanitro died in a gas chamber at Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp in the night between the 23rd and 24th of April 1945. Adrano was the scene of much fighting during the latter phases of Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily, during World War II. Nazi forces were driven from the island and in the course of their retreat they attempted to hold the northeastern corner of Sicily in the hopes that they would eventually be able to retake the entire island while using the northeastern portion of the island as a way to resupply their forces from the south of the Italian peninsula. The Nazis had to abandon this plan when the British 30th Corps forced their way into Adrano while at the same time the British 13th Corps battled the Nazis in the nearby town of Randazzo. Once Adrano and Randazzo fell to the British, the Nazis decided they had no choice but to retire to Messina and use it to evacuate the rest of their forces from Sicily.Bitter Victory: The Battle for Sicily, 1943 by Carlo D'Este pg. 508-509 =Name= The Romans changed the name of the township into Hadranum; during the occupation by the Arabs it was called Adarnu or sometimes Adarna, while the Normans referred to it as Adernio and Adriano. Until 1929 its official name was Adernò, until eventually it was changed into Adrano. Several elder inhabitants of the town still call it Adernò. Ponte dei Saraceni.

It is situated on the ruins of the antique church of St Vito. * The medieval Ponte dei Saraceni (Bridge of the Saracens) about 3 km outside the town * The ruins of the original Greek settlement visitable in the east of the town. Due to the prospering Catholic tradition of the region, Adrano has numerous antique chapels and small churches hidden in the backstreets. Moreover, Adrano is famous for its colourful carnival and the passionate celebration of San Nicola, in honour of its patron Saint Nicola Politi on August 3. Transportation Adrano is linked to the rapidway SS 121 leading from Paternò to Catania. Near Bronte, a large mall named Etnapolis has been opened recently. Adrano is connected to the province capital Catania by a bus route which is operated by the FCE and leads through various towns to the central station of Catania and further to the communal beach. A rapid bus skips the smaller towns and leads to Catania directly over the highway. In the summer season, a bus connects Adrano, Bronte, Randazzo, Floresta and Naso in the province of Messina. Between the station of Catania-Borgo and Riposto operates the Littorina, a nostalgic Diesel fuelled train which stops in Adrano, Paternò, Biancavilla, Santa Maria di Licodia and other towns. The extension of a route of the rapid transit railway of Catania to Paternò and Adrano has been planned and the constructions have begun. Adrano is not linked with the national train system of Trenitalia. Moreover, the FCE operates two bus routes (A and B) in Adrano. Health Adrano does not possess any hospital but only a so-called Guardia medica, a paramedic station with emergency personnel, vehicles and equipment. The nearest hospital is the Maria SS. Addolorata in Biancavilla, which is on stand-by as well for emergencies in Adrano.

It is based on a modified version of their Temple of Apshai game engine, which was used for most of their releases in this era. The game was released for the Apple II, IBM PC (as a self-booting disk), TRS-80, Commodore PET, VIC-20, and Atari 8-bit family. The game requires the player to search out a space fortress looking for ten hostages. Presented in a top-down view, the player can only see the area immediately around them, so the entire base has to be searched room by room. There is a 60-minute time limit on the mission. Rescue at Rigel was followed by Star Warrior, and the two rebranded to be part of their \\"Starquest\\" series. Gameplay Atari 8-bit family version Players take on the role of adventurer Sudden Smith. Smith must try to rescue captives from the interior of an asteroid orbiting the star Rigel. Players have 60 minutes to rescue 10 human captives from the alien moon base. They must first find the captives before delivering them to the rescue ship (via a transport beam). Players must defeat or avoid the enemies wandering the base: the alien Tollahs, two types of armed robots, a six-legged \\"cerbanth\\", and a huge amoebic slug. As players forge deeper into the alien stronghold, they have the opportunity to acquire better weapons. The playfield is presented as a top- down view of the current location of the hero. The game is turn-based, with the player given a certain number of \\"points\\" to spend on various actions, completing their turn when the points ran out. Rescue at Rigel is very similar to Temple of Apshai, a popular dungeon crawl by Epyx, part of their \\"Dunjonquest\\" series. Rescue at Rigel had a timer similar to The Datestones of Ryn, an earlier Dunjonquest game. Rescue at Rigel used the concept of providing room descriptions similar to those used in some Dunjonquest games, but instead of unique descriptions for numbered rooms, the game had multiple rooms labeled \\"Sanctum\\", for example, and a detailed description of what typical Sanctums contained was provided in the manual along with about a dozen other room types. Reception Bruce F. Webster reviewed Rescue at Rigel in The Space Gamer No. 34. Webster commented that \\"if you've got the money and the interest, buy it. In fact, if you've only got either the money or the interest, buy it - you'll be glad you did.\\" Jerry Pournelle reported in BYTE in 1983 that Rescue at Rigel was one of several Epyx games his sons enjoyed playing.

It is found primarily in the Caribbean. John James Audubon painted these pigeons, including the watercolour painting in his work, Birds of America, published in the early 19th century. Taxonomy In the first half of the 18th century the white-crowned pigeon was described and illustrated by several naturalist including John Ray in 1713, Hans Sloane in 1725 and Mark Catesby in 1731. When in 1758 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the tenth edition, he placed the white-crowned pigeon with all the other pigeons in the genus Columba. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name Columba leucocephala and cited the earlier authors. The specific epithet combines the Ancient Greek leukos meaning \\"white\\" and -kephalos meaning \\"-headed\\". Although Linnaeus gave the location as North America, the type locality is taken to be the Bahamas following Catesby. The species is now placed in the genus Patagioenas that was introduced by the German naturalist Ludwig Reichenbach in 1853 with the white-crowned pigeon as the type species. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised. Description White-crowned pigeon drawing by Audubon The white-crowned pigeon can measure in length, span across the wings, and weigh . It is around the same size as the common rock pigeon, but weighs a bit less since it is generally less chunky and has a relatively longer and more square tail.Gibbs, David, Pigeons and Doves. A&C; Black (2001), Adult birds' plumage varies from a slate gray to an almost-black color. Its iridescent collar-patch is notably only seen under good lighting, shining a barred white pattern with green. Their distinct crown-patch can vary in shade of color from a more bright white in males to a more gray-white in most females. Juveniles can have a grayish- brown color for They have a white iris and a pale-tipped red bill. Juveniles are a less dark shade of grey, lack the nape pattern and white iris, and show only a few pale feathers on the crown. Their call is a loud, deep coo-cura-coo or coo-croo. This species is a member of a diverse clade of Patagioenas which vary much in appearance, but are united by their triple coos (except in the scaled pigeon). Distribution and habitat It is a resident breeder mainly in the Bahamas, Cuba, Jamaica and Antigua. It breeds in smaller numbers in Hispaniola (Dominican Republic and Haiti), Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Anguilla and other Caribbean islands. It also breeds along the Caribbean coast of Central America. In the United States it is found only in the Florida Keys, Everglades, and the southern tip of mainland Florida. They will often spend the wintertime in the Caribbean islands. The white- crowned pigeon primarily lives and breeds in nest colonies or individually in low lying, coastal, mangrove forests, and will travel inland to feed on the fruits and seeds of a wide variety of plants. In Florida, the white-crowned pigeon has historically been documented nesting exclusively on remote, tidally inundated mangrove islands in wildlife refuges. Recent observations have confirmed nesting on the southern tip of mainland Florida. With few exceptions, this species requires isolated offshore mangrove islets with limited disturbance for breeding. These tidally inundated mangrove islands which provide some protection from predators such as raccoons. However, several instances of white-crowned pigeons nesting in heavily-trafficked, urban areas, such as downtown Key West and Miami Florida, have recently been observed. This could be due to habitat loss as a result of hurricanes, and/or increased predation pressure in their historic nesting habitat. Threats and conservation A main threat to this species is loss of habitat due to deforestation and habitat degradation. The white-crowned pigeon needs two distinct habitats, one for nesting and one for feeding. They typically breed in coastal red mangroves (Rhizophora mangle), which continue to be clear-cut for crops such as sugarcane. Agriculture and deforestation have become a problem for the species' feeding grounds, typically inland hardwood forests. The bird is very skittish, and is known to simply abandon its nest when it is encroached upon. In Florida, White-crowned pigeons often feed on the fruit of poisonwood, (Metopium toxiferum) Unfortunately, this native plant causes severe human dermatitis and is often removed. The white-crowned pigeon is also an important game species throughout much of its range. Although, changes have been made to hunting regulations in the Bahamas, illegal hunting is still a problem for these pigeons. Other threats to this species include: In Florida a major cause of mortality is collision with man-made objects; and pesticide use. Like the extinct passenger pigeon this species \\"illustrates a very important principle of conservation biology: it is not always necessary to kill the last pair of a species to force it to extinction. These birds are \\"threatened by the slaughter of nesting birds on its Caribbean breeding grounds.\\" ReferencesExternal links * BirdLife Species Factsheet * White-Crowned Pigeon Bird Sound white-crowned pigeon Category:Native birds of the Southeastern United States Category:Birds of the Caribbean Category:Birds of Hispaniola Category:Birds of the Dominican Republic Category:Birds of Haiti Category:Birds of the Yucatán Peninsula Category:Birds of Belize Category:Birds of Panama white-crowned pigeon white-crowned pigeon ","title":"White-crowned pigeon"},{"id":"2288403","text":"Jeremy Jones may refer to: *Jeremy Jones (freerider) (born 1975), American snowboarder, big mountain riding, Jones Snowboards *Jeremy Jones (freestyler) (born 1976), American freestyle snowboarder *Jeremy Jones (pool player) (born 1971), American pool player *Jeremy Jones (cricketer) (born 1979), Jamaican- born cricketer See also *Jerry Jones (disambiguation) ","title":"Jeremy Jones"},{"id":"2288411","title":"For All the Cows"},{"id":"2288422","text":":For the current active command, see Air Mobility Command Air Transport Command (ATC) was a United States Air Force unit that was created during World War II as the strategic airlift component of the United States Army Air Forces. It had two main missions, the first being the delivery of supplies and equipment between the United States and the overseas combat theaters; the second was the ferrying of aircraft from the manufacturing plants in the United States to where they were needed for training or for operational use in combat. ATC also operated a worldwide air transportation system for military personnel. Inactivated on 1 June 1948, Air Transport Command was the precursor to what became the Military Air Transport Service in 1948 and was redesignated Military Airlift Command (MAC) in 1966. It was consolidated with MAC in 1982, providing a continuous history of long range airlift through 1992 when the mission was transferred to today's Air Mobility Command. History By no means least among the achievements of the Army Air Forces (AAF) in World War II was its development of a worldwide system of air transport. The development of transport aircraft in the 1920s and 1930s added a new dimension to the art of warfare, and around its varied capacities the AAF built an air transportation system such as had never before been envisaged. That system, and its functions, soon became synonymous with the organization which controlled it, the Air Transport Command. =Origins= ATC's origins begin during World War I with the need to transport aircraft supplies and materiel from the aircraft manufacturers to the maintenance facilities supporting the training bases in the United States. Railroads were used to move the equipment and aircraft from one base to another and to the Ports of Embarkation along the East Coast for subsequent sea shipment to the battlefields of France.Part I, Organization & Its Responsibilities, Chapter 2, \\"The AAF\\": Craven, Wesley and Cate, James, The Army Air Forces In World War II, Volume Six: \\"Men and Planes\\". New Imprint by the Office of Air Force History Washington, D.C., 1983 It wasn't until the 1920s that the development of cargo and personnel transport aircraft began with aircraft such as the Boeing Model 40. From 1926 until 1942, the Air Corps’ logistical responsibilities were vested in the Office of the Chief of the Air Corps Materiel Division, with headquarters at Wright Field, Ohio and with four major depots (at Sacramento, California; San Antonio, Texas; Fairfield, Ohio; and Middletown, Pennsylvania) distributed over the United States. In the early 1930s, the Air Corps began formally experimenting with the systematic use of air transport for the distribution of aviation supplies. The Materiel Division in 1932 established a provisional 1st Air Transport Group with four transport squadrons, each of them equipped with Bellanca Aircruisers and Douglas DC-2s, intended to serve one of the four major air depots in the distribution of spare parts to Army airbases. The group, redesignated the 10th Transport Group in 1937, also transported supplies from one depot to another. =Lend Lease= With the outbreak of war in Europe in 1939, several European governments approached the United States for military equipment. They needed immediate help for the battles they might very soon have to fight on their own soil against invading German armies. The French ordered Douglas DB-7 (A-20) two-engine light bombers;Baugher, Douglas DB-7 in French Service Curtiss P-36 Hawks,Baugher, Curtiss Hawk with Armee de l'Air and some Curtiss P-40D Warhawks, although the P-40s were never delivered.Curtiss P-40D (Kittyhawk I) However, it was Britain's Royal Air Force which needed massive reinforcement, especially after the losses it incurred on the continent during the German invasion of the Low Countries and France during May 1940. The idea of developing a regular military service for ferrying aircraft was the result of several factors. Production of aircraft by United States manufacturers was increasing for both the Army Air Corps and for purchase by the British. As produced and ready for delivery at the factory, these aircraft were flyable but also needed modifications before they were ready for combat service. It was advantageous to fly the aircraft to a separate modification center where changes could be made, rather than implementing these changes on the production line that would interrupt production. United States civilian pilots, contracted by the British, would pick up their aircraft at the production facility and fly them to designated transfer points in the Montreal area where the modifications could be made. From Montreal, a Canadian civilian agency under contract to the British government began ferrying US-built bombers across the North Atlantic from Newfoundland to Prestwick (near Glasgow) (Scotland / UK) under the auspices of a private British company, set up by the British Government for that purpose. By ferrying these bombers under their own power, vital shipping space was saved and factory-to-combat delivery time was cut from approximately three months to less than ten days. However, the British Government had limited funds, and was rapidly running out of resources for the purchase of war materiel of all types from the United States. In the spring of 1941, the Roosevelt Administration was committed to give all possible help, short of actual combat, to the United Kingdom and the remnants of her allies against Nazi Germany. With the passage of the Lend-Lease Act in March 1941 the United States stated its intention to assist the British in its war efforts and was a statement of the desire of Congress and the people of the United States to that effect. With that clear intention, the doors were opened for larger numbers of aircraft to be sent to the Royal Air Force to defend Great Britain. It was also clear that the pioneering efforts of the British would have to be expanded to accommodate the increased number of aircraft. However, the United States was not a belligerent nation and it was also a period of extreme diplomatic delicacy, when aircraft purchased by the British had to be literally pushed across the US-Canada border in order to protect the neutrality of the United States. These shipments to the British caused a shortage in the United States of multi-engine aircraft in particular. Air Corps units were in need of training in long-range navigation, weather and radio-flying that a coast-to-coast ferrying service would give them in the latest models of aircraft. On 12 May 1941 the Office of the Chief of Air Corps (OCAC) was notified by the War Department that he was authorized for training purposes to have military pilots conduct cross-country flights in aircraft destined for use by the British Government for training purposes. On 12 April 1941 plans were presented to the OCAC for the construction of a landing field on the west coast of Greenland for the staging of aircraft via Newfoundland, Greenland and Iceland to the United Kingdom. This would make possible the ferrying of medium and light bombers across the North Atlantic Ocean. =Air Corps Ferrying Command= Long Beach Army Air Field California Sixth Ferrying Group book The British ferrying service was well under way when the Lend-Lease Act became law on 11 March 1941. With the North Atlantic sea lanes vulnerable to German U-boat attacks, Major General Henry H. Arnold established the Air Corps Ferrying Command on May 29, 1941, to deliver lend-lease aircraft overseas from the USA. Commanded and organized by Brig. Gen. Robert Olds, the mission of the new command was, first, \\"to move aircraft by air from factories to such terminals as may be designated by the Chief of the Air Corps,\\" and second, \\"to maintain such special air ferry services [i.e., air transport services] as may be required to meet specific situations.\\" These were broad powers, and working within them, the Ferrying Command eventually expanded far beyond the limits imagined by those responsible for its creation. The second assignment provided specific authority for the establishment of a military air transport service over the North Atlantic between the US and the United Kingdom, a project which had been under consideration for some months.Part I, Plans And Early Operations, January 1939 to August 1942, Chapter 9: \\"The Early Development of Air Transport and Ferrying\\": Craven, Wesley and Cate, James, The Army Air Forces In World War II. New Imprint by the Office of Air Force History Washington, D.C., 1983 Ferrying Command relied initially on two-engine and single-engine pilots detailed from the Air Force Combat Command (formerly GHQ Air Force) for thirty- to ninety-day tours of temporary duty. More highly qualified four-engine pilots of the Combat Command, as well as navigators and other crew members, were borrowed to fly the trans-Atlantic transport shuttle. In the summer and fall of 1941, approximately 200 pilots were trained at Barksdale Field, Louisiana, especially for ferrying duty, although they were assigned to the Combat Command and served, as did the others, on temporary- duty status with the Ferrying Command. ACFC Domestic Wing During the fall of 1941, Ferrying Command had assumed an additional responsibility for delivery of some AAF's own planes from factory to stations within the United States. After the Pearl Harbor attack, the ferry of aircraft within the United States quickly became a major function of the Command.Administrative History of the Ferrying Command, 29 May 1941-30 June 1942. Army Air Forces Historical Studies: No. 33. Prepared by Assistant Chief of Air Staff, Intelligence, Historical Division, HQ USAAF, Washington, D.C., June 1945 To ferry aircraft purchased by the Royal Air Force (RAF) from factories in the western and central United States to transfer points on the Atlantic seaboard required the establishment of routes over which the aircraft could be flown. Support stations were set up at civilian as well as military airports for the aircraft to be refueled and any necessary servicing performed. The aircraft factories, particularly the Boeing factory near Seattle and the Southern California plants of Lockheed, Consolidated, Douglas, North American and Vultee required a series of organizations to accept the aircraft from the manufacturer, and provide a ferrying crew to transport the aircraft. In Southern California, the Long Beach Municipal Airport was leased by the War Department as a concentration point for all aircraft, except for B-24s to be ferried directly from the Consolidated plant. The manufacturers provided civilian pilots to deliver the aircraft from their facilities to Long Beach, where an Air Corps procurement representative inspected the aircraft and turned them over to Ferrying Command. This facility was designated as Headquarters, Western Division, Air Corps Ferrying Command. Boeing Field, Seattle, was the location of the second concentration center, for planes manufactured by Boeing. Other concentration centers used civilian airfields as they became available, as happened in Detroit and Nashville. From the West Coast, the ferrying routes (as initially laid down) and their corresponding transatlantic transport method were: * Route One: Heavy bombers capable of crossing the North Atlantic by flight : Boeing Field to Wayne County Airport (Romulus, Michigan) to Montreal, Quebec. * Route Two: Heavy bombers capable of crossing the North Atlantic by flight : Boeing Field to Salt Lake City, Utah; then via Omaha, Nebraska and Wayne County to Montreal * Route Three: Short-range, light bombardment and training aircraft, to cross the North Atlantic by ship : Long Beach to Tucson, Arizona; thence via Midland and Dallas, Texas to New Orleans, Louisiana * Route Four A: Short-range light bombardment and training aircraft, to cross by ship : Long Beach to Tucson; then via Midland; Tulsa, Oklahoma; Scott Field, Illinois; Patterson Field, Ohio and Wayne County to Montreal * Route Four B: Short-range light bombardment and training aircraft, to cross by ship : Long Beach to Tucson; then via Midland; Dallas; Jackson, Mississippi; Atlanta, Fort Bragg, North Carolina and Bolling Field, D.C. to Mitchel Field, New York At the end of each route was the designated transfer point at which final inspections were accomplished and the aircraft transferred from Air Corps jurisdiction to representatives of the RAF Ferry Command or the British Air Commission. To replace and supplement Montreal as a transfer point, Ferrying Command then initiated development of airfields in northern Maine, some 300 miles nearer the United Kingdom than the Canadian city, at Presque Isle, Houlton and Millinocket. Although Millinocket was abandoned during construction, the Presque Isle Army Airfield and Houlton Army Airfield were completed and opened for service early in 1942. Once the ferried aircraft reached the transfer point, the crew returned to either Seattle or Los Angeles by rail. After Pearl Harbor, the scope of Ferrying Command's mission within the United States expanded to the domestic ferrying of all multi-engine Army aircraft, all British and Lend-Lease aircraft, and with the air movement of troops by domestic airlines as well. On 3 January 1942, the wing was divided into six geographic sectors. The sectors and headquarters were: * Northwest Sector, Boeing Field, Seattle, Washington : Responsible for all deliveries from Boeing Aircraft : Redesignated 7th Ferrying Group, 28 May 1942. * California Sector, Long Beach Municipal Airport, California : Served the Consolidated, North American, Vultee, Douglas, Lockheed, Ryan, Northrup and Vega factories in California : Redesignated 6th Ferrying Group, 28 May 1942. * Middle Western Sector, Hensley Field, Dallas, Texas : Responsible for ferrying the product of the Boeing, Cessna and Beech plants at Wichita, Kansas; the Douglas plant at Tulsa, Oklahoma, and the North American factories at Dallas and Kansas City, the Consolidated plant at Fort Worth, and the Martin factory at Omaha : Redesignated 5th Ferrying Group, 28 May 1942. * Nashville Sector, Berry Field, Nashville, Tennessee : Accepted Vultee planes produced in Nashville and Curtiss-Wright aircraft from St. Louis : Redesignated 4th Ferrying Group, 28 May 1942. * Detroit Sector, Wayne County Airport, Romulus, Michigan : Accepted deliveries from the Curtiss-Wright plants at Buffalo, New York and Columbus, Ohio; the Ford Willow Run plant (near Ypsilanti, Michigan) and the Bell factory at Buffalo : Redesignated 3d Ferrying Group, 28 May 1942. * Northeast Sector, Logan Field, Baltimore, Maryland : Served the Martin plant at Baltimore; the Fairchild factory at Hagerstown, Maryland; Piper plant at Lock Haven, Pennsylvania and the Grumman and Republic plants on Long Island. : Redesignated 2d Ferrying Group, 28 May 1942. ACFC Foreign Wing From the domestic ferrying assignment it was only a step to the Command taking over the responsibility for delivering or supervising the delivery of AAF and lend- lease aircraft to theaters of war scattered across the world. After the USA entered World War II, it became clear that the fastest and most economical method of moving combat aircraft from the factory to the front, which might be 10,000 to 15,000 miles away due to the worldwide nature of the conflict, was to ferry them under their own power. Also, to keep aircraft at their highest efficiency, an air transport system for the rapid delivery of spare engines and parts, auxiliary equipment of all kinds, flight crews, and ground personnel became an absolute necessity, and supplementary to the traditional and considerably slower method of surface transport. Major trunk air routes of AAF Ferrying Command, June 1942 During 1941, four major air routes were developed. These were: * The North Atlantic route, earliest to be developed for military purposes, provided an air connection between the Eastern USA and Britain, while * The Northwest Staging Route connected mainland USA with Alaska and the Soviet Union via Siberia. * The South Pacific air ferry route in World War II connected the USA via Hawaii with Australia and islands of the Western Pacific. * The South Atlantic air ferry route linked the US with West Africa via Natal, Brazil, the Middle East, India and China. Secondary routes between Australia and India, and between Australia and the Philippines were also developed. Later, a Mid-Atlantic route was developed via the Azores to link the US with Europe and North Africa. While this route was not opened until late 1943, the US and Britain were at all times prepared to occupy the Azores, had the security and future use of this route been threatened by the Axis Powers. By early 1942, it had become clear that the Philippines could not be held, principally because the Japanese had cut the only sea and air lanes over which available reinforcements, such as they were, could reach General MacArthur. By the end of February 1942, the air connection between India and Australia was also cut due to the advance of Japanese forces into Southeast Asia, although some heavy bombers and other reinforcements from the USA were able to get through before the Japanese captured Singapore and overran the Netherlands East Indies. Fortunately for the Allies, the five remaining major routes were held. During 1942, the South Atlantic route to West Africa and beyond assumed an importance far surpassing that of any of the others. In contrast to the slowness of the North Atlantic, South Pacific and Alaskan routes, the South Atlantic airway immediately came to support a heavy volume of air traffic that, because only four former Pan American Clippers, two TWA Stratoliners, and 11 converted B-24 Liberators were capable of hauling cargo on the trans-Atlantic leg during the first six months of 1942, strained its facilities and personnel to the limit. Lend-lease aircraft and supplies were sent over the route to the British forces in Egypt and the Russians through Persia, with a smaller volume going via India into China. The earliest heavy bomber reinforcements sent to the US Air Forces in the Southwest Pacific following the Japanese attack traveled over the route, prepared, briefed, and supported by the Ferrying Command, as were most of the aircraft and crews that would form the Ninth Air Force in the Middle East and the Tenth Air Force in India. Fighter aircraft for the Ninth and Tenth Air Forces and for the American Volunteer Group in China were shipped by water to the west coast of Africa where they were assembled and flown overland to their destinations. And, while ferrying operations were increasing steadily, the air transport service in support of both ferrying and combat operations was enlarged and extended, albeit in piecemeal fashion. Later, a Mid-Atlantic route was developed via the Azores to link the US with Europe and North Africa. While this route was not opened until late 1943, the US and Britain were at all times prepared to occupy the Azores, had the security and future use of this route been threatened by the Axis Powers. During the thirteen months of its existence, Ferrying Command had grown from an original staff of two officers and a civilian secretary to a strength of over 11,000 officers and enlisted men, in addition to its civilian employees and those of the civil air carriers operating under its supervision. As the name implies, ferrying had been its main job, and during the period its pilots ferried 13,595 aircraft to final domestic destinations, while 632 planes were delivered to foreign destinations under the supervision of the command. =Air Transport Command=Change of roles Air Transport Command major routes, 1 September 1945 Air transport services conducted by the Ferrying Command (before the Pearl Harbor attack), were first to Britain beginning July 1941 and later in October to Cairo. They were like courier services and were secondary to the major job for which the command was created, that of ferrying aircraft from US factories to Canada and onward to Britain or to US ports of embarkation. Probably no one then foresaw that a network of long-range transport routes, supporting the daily movement of hundreds of tons of supplies and thousands of passengers, would spread across the world and that daily flights to such remote areas as the Aleutians, Australia, the Philippines, India, and China would become commonplace.Craven & Cate, Section Four: The Air Transport Command Responsibilities, Chapter 9: \\"The Early Development of Air Transport and Ferrying\\" Indeed, a limited view of the role of long-range air transportation in World War II persisted for some months after the USA became an active belligerent. Not until the late spring and summer of 1942, when large backlogs of supplies awaiting air shipment to the front began to build up at ports of embarkation and when it became clear that almost unlimited demands would be made in future for the rapid movement of urgently needed materials and personnel, did the idea of air transport as a major instrument of logistics begin to take shape. In order to operate a worldwide air logistics system, maximum use would have to be made of the planes, men, and facilities of the civil airlines. The Ferrying Command was in no position to expand its own military transport services. The Air Corps and the Air Transport Association of America (ATA), representing the domestic carriers, had developed a mobilization plan between 1936 and 1939 to provide this support through contract services. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8974 on 13 December 1941, which gave the Secretary of War authority to nationalize the airlines, but except for several instances early in 1942 to meet specific emergencies, the order was not invoked. ATA president Edgar S. Gorrell, a colonel in the Air Service during World War I and the driving force behind pre-war creation of the mobilization plan, delivered immediate full cooperation of the airlines from the first day of the war and is credited with persuading Roosevelt not to nationalize the airlines.Orenic, Liesl (2009). On the Ground: Labor Struggles in the American Airline Industry. University of Illinois Press. , p. 50Serling, Robert J. \\"America's Airlines,\\" Flying Magazine, September 1977, Vol. 63 No. 9, p. 229 The ferrying activity continued to increase as more aircraft were turned out by the factories, as new combat units became ready for deployment overseas, and as the need for battle replacements grew more and more emphasis came to be placed on the air transportation function. Air transport had passed beyond the stage of being primarily a courier service or an adjunct of ferrying; it was well on the way to becoming a major instrument of logistical support to combat operations on the ground and in the air. The civil airlines, in addition to having the available flying personnel (most of whom had learned to fly in the Air Corps) and physical equipment, had another equally valuable though less tangible asset. They had the wealth of practical knowledge in conducting scheduled air transport operations, the administrative competence, and the mastery of techniques that came from long experience. The AAF, on the other hand, had no such expertise among its senior leadership nor experience from its nascent operations. In January 1942, Arnold established the AAF Office of Civil Aviation and recalled the chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Administration, Donald H. Connolly, to military service, appointing him Military Director of Civil Aviation and directing him to use EO 8974 to transfer the CAA and its regulatory control of the airlines to the Army Air Forces. L. Welch Pogue, chairman of the safety agency for civil aviation, the Civil Aeronautics Board, then wrote to the White House advocating the establishment of a civilian air transportation service reporting directly to the President to operate airline contracts for the military, an idea that had been broached during the development period of ATA- Air Corps mobilization plan. In response, General Arnold proposed that the AAF instead control and direct such a service, primarily composed of pilots and aircraft contracted from U.S. civilian airlines. Creation of Air Transport Command The Air Service Command (before October 1941 known as the Air Corps Maintenance Command) had been operating a well-established air transport service within the continental united States for months before the Ferrying Command was established, using the 50th Transport Wing to move technical cargo between air depots and subdepots. In the first half of 1941 the ASC moved more cargo domestically than all the civilian carriers in the United States. Several months after the war began, demands for materiel forced ASC to use civilian carriers on a contract basis, creating a Contract Air Cargo Division managed by former airline executives, who established routes outside the United States to Alaska, the upper Atlantic, and Central America. Many of the routes and services duplicated those of the Ferrying Command. Expedient attempts by Headquarters AAF to establish a clear division of authority were unsuccessful, particularly after the 50th Transport Wing was transferred at the end of April 1942 to a newly created organization, the \\"Air Transport Command\\" (a combat organization). This left ASC with only its civilian carriers, of which considerable friction existed with Ferrying Command which had let conflicting contracts to different carriers. Arnold saw the need for unified control of air transport and bolstered by Pogue's memorandum, which recommended that at the least all Army air transportation should be unified under one command, submitted the issue to a board of officers with instructions to consider the whole problem. Before the board could make an official report, however, Arnold made a decision on 20 June 1942 which embodied substantially Pogue's second recommendation. The Ferrying Command was renamed the Air Transport Command and the organization already bearing that name became the I Troop Carrier Command to reflect its mission of training crews and units for the combat lifts of parachute and airborne infantry. A change of command at AAF Ferrying Command took place in the meantime. In March 1942 General Olds was stricken with a heart attack, and was replaced by Colonel (eventually Lieutenant General) Harold L. George, who remained as ATC's wartime commander. Effective 1 July 1942, the new Air Transport Command was given what the official history of the AAF described as \\"sweeping responsibilities\\": * The ferrying of all aircraft within the United States and to destinations outside of the United States as directed by the Commanding General, Army Air Forces. * The control, operation, and maintenance of establishments and facilities on air routes outside of the United States. * The transportation by air of personnel, materiel, and mail for all War Department agencies, except those served by Troop Carrier units. In addition, before the end of June plans by the Army's Services of Supply to create its own air transportation service were halted when the SOS agreed to transfer to the AAF all of its air transportation responsibilities and its responsibility for setting priorities for travel by military and commercial aircraft. The Contract Air Cargo Division was terminated by ASC and its personnel transferred to ATC to end the division of responsibility. The new Air Transport Command was initially only a semi-military organization, with most of its leadership coming from the ranks of airline executives who accepted direct USAAF commissions, usually as colonels or majors.Gann, Ernest, Fate Is The Hunter, New York: Simon & Schuster (1961), , pp. 160–164 Until 1944, ATC also drew heavily on the airlines for manpower, using experienced civil airline pilots, radio operators, and other aircrew personnel from the airlines to crew transports that had been purchased by the Army from civilian sources. ATC's original mission was ferrying airplanes to overseas destinations, a mission that had been originally performed by the AAF Ferrying Command that preceded it and from which ATC headquarters military personnel were drawn. As the war progressed, ATC's air transport division became more and more involved in transporting military personnel and cargo overseas.Glines, C.V., Flying the Hump, Air Force Association Magazine (March 1991) Vol. 74 http://www.afa.org/magazine/1991/0391hump.asp At the time, it was redesignated and given its enlarged mission, the command was already in the process of reorganization. Operations The newly designated Air Transport Command consisted of two main divisions, the Ferrying Division and the Air Transportation Division, corresponding roughly to the two primary responsibilities of the command. The ATC Ferrying Division was responsible for the transfer of combat aircraft to overseas bases, and their replacement. Thousands of bombers, transport aircraft and fighters flown by combat crews on their way overseas were under ATC control during these movements. Ferrying of combat aircraft by ATC personnel became a major ATC mission to the end of the war as vast numbers of replacement aircraft had to be transferred from factory to combat theaters. The command ferried 30,000 aircraft in 1942, 72,000 in 1943, 108,000 in 1944, and 57,000 in 1945, for a total of more than 267,000 in all. In addition, five major field organizations, known as wings, were constituted on 12 June 1942 and activated at various dates during the latter part of the month. Initially, they were known as the 23d through the 27th AAF Ferrying wings, but the command quickly requested and secured a change to more descriptive geographical names. On 5 July, they were redesignated the North Atlantic, Caribbean, South Atlantic, Africa-Middle East, and South Pacific wings. Over the course of the war, additional wings and divisions were created as the scope and complexity of the command increased. More than 130 two- and four-engine transport aircraft had become available to the command by 1 July 1942, of which 10 or 15 were being flown by military crews and the remainder by the contract carriers. Many of these had come from new production, some were acquired from Air Service Command, but others became available as the result of a presidential order of 6 May directing the Secretary of War to commandeer all transports of the DC-3 type operated by the domestic air carriers in excess of 200 and to refit them \\"for such transport services as will most effectively serve the war purposes of the United Nations.\\" The transfer of the aircraft from the airlines to the War Department made it possible for the former also to release additional crews for employment in military operations. In the beginning of ATC operations, the Douglas C-47 Skytrain was the primary transport plane in use. At first, the C-47 was often fitted with long-range tanks for long flights, but as larger multi-engine aircraft became available, the C-47 was redeployed for use on shorter routes. In 1942, the Consolidated C-87 Liberator Express, a transport version of the B-24 Liberator bomber, was adopted for service with the ATC. The C-87 had a much longer range and higher service ceiling, making it a better choice for over-water transport flights, but its hurried conversion from a dedicated bomber design resulted in inevitable compromises that affected its reliability in service.Gann, Ernest, Fate Is The Hunter, New York: Simon & Schuster (1961), , pp. 213–217 In 1942, at the personal request of General 'Hap' Arnold, C. R. Smith, formerly president of American Airlines, was commissioned a colonel in ATC and made its executive officer, thereafter assuming the positions of Chief of Staff and Deputy Commander.Hall of Fame, Major General Cyrus Rowlett Smith, Air Transport Association http://www.atalink.org/hallfame/c.r.smith.html During his tenure as Chief of Staff, Smith was largely responsible for ATC's considerable expansion in operations. In the same year, Smith proposed that ATC assume responsibility for the Hump airlift operation, as he believed that ATC would do a better job of transporting cargo to China. However, due to a lack of navigation aids, personnel, suitable airfields and maintenance facilities, and above all, sufficient multi-engine transport aircraft suited to the difficult flight conditions, tonnage levels flown to China over The Hump did not appreciably increase until late 1943.CBI Hump Pilots Association, Flying the Hump: A Fact Sheet for the Hump Operations During World War II, (USAAF) China-Burma-India (CBI) Theater of Operations http://www.cbi-history.com/part_xii_hump5.html As the war progressed, ATC received improved aircraft types for transport duty, including the Curtiss-Wright C-46 Commando and the Douglas C-54 Skymaster, a militarized transport version of the DC-4. The C-54 in particular took over the C-87's duties in long-distance, over-water transport flights. In the China-India theater, the C-54, with nearly five times the load capacity of the C-47 and twice that of the C-46, significantly increased cargo tonnage levels flown to China, becoming the primary lifter for Hump operations. Even though the C-54 had a service ceiling of only 12,000 feet, plans were made to replace all the C-87s in the Hump operation with Skymasters by October 1945, and have 540 assigned by April 1946 to bring load capability up to 86,000 tons monthly. ATC transports were used primarily to deliver high value cargo and important personnel to overseas destinations. For example, ATC C-87s delivered new engines to Libya to replace those worn out on the B-24s used on the famous low-level mission against Ploiești. An emergency shipment of artillery fuzes helped win the battle of Tobruk. When the first B-29s were sent to China, advance party personnel and additional combat crew personnel proceeded the bombers aboard ATC C-87s. On return flights, C-87s and C-54s brought back combat crews who had finished their combat tours and were returning to the States. At the end of the war, ATC C-54s transported 11th Airborne Division personnel from Okinawa to Japan. While little known the Caribbean Division And South Atlantic Divisions of ATC also operated its own small navy for rescue of downed pilots comprising converted submarine chasers and Catalina seaplanes. While not limited to rescuing ATC pilots the main role was that of insuring a rescue of ATC pilots who were downed on the first leg of the southern trans- Atlantic route to Europe and SE Asia. In areas where ATC aircraft flew where there were a possibility of hostile aircraft or ships, other services provided air to sea rescue. ATC rescue services operated only in areas where there was nil chance of armed encounter. By the end of World War II, Air Transport Command had developed into a huge military air carrier with a worldwide route pattern. From an organization of approximately 37,000 personnel (6,500 of them overseas) in December 1942, it numbered nearly 210,000 in August 1945, the bulk stationed overseas (150,000). By the end of the war the command had 3,090 major transports assigned. Although in the first half of 1944 the C-46 appeared to be headed for ascendancy as the predominant transport type of the command, and ATC more than tripled its inventory of C-54s in the final year of the war to 839 transports, the C-47 remained the workhorse transport of ATC throughout the conflict, never exceeded in total by any other type. Its numbers remained steady throughout 1942 and 1943, but increased dramatically in the last 18 months of the war, rising to a total of 1,341. Routes had been established to places where aircraft had been unheard of before the war. Airline personnel who had never left the United States before joining the military had become veterans of long over-water flights to the remotest regions of earth. In its final full month of wartime operations (July 1945), ATC carried 275,000 passengers (50,000 domestically) and 100,000 tons of mail and cargo, 96.7% of it overseas. =Sports= The Air Transport Command fielded the Rockets football team with several notable former college and professional players, such as Vernon Martin of the Pittsburgh Steelers. =Postwar era= With the end of the war, the Air Transport Command found itself in limbo. Senior USAAF authorities considered ATC to be a wartime necessity that was no longer needed, and expected its civilian personnel, including former airline pilots, to return to their peacetime occupations. Senior ATC officers, on the other hand, thought that ATC should be developed into a national government operated airline, an idea that was soundly opposed by the airline industry. While the war had firmly established the necessity of a troop carrier mission, most military officers believed the role performed by ATC should be provided by contract carriers.Stanley M. Ulanoff, MATS: The Story of the Military Air Transport Service, 1964, The Moffa Press, Inc. When the United States Air Force was established as a separate service in 1947, the Air Transport Command was not established as one of its missions. The ATC commander and his staff took it upon themselves to convince the new civilian leadership of the newly created Department of Defense (DOD) (and Secretaries of the Army and Air Force) that ATC had a mission. They seized upon testimony by former Troop Carrier Command commander Major General Paul Williams that the Air Force should have a long-range troop deployment capability, and began advocating that ATC transports could be used to deploy troops. Williams had been pressing for the development of a long-range troop carrier airplane when he made his statement. The DOD believed it should have its own air transport service and decided that ATC should become the Military Air Transport Service, supported by the USAF, even though not listed as a formal military mission. When the ATC commander wrote a mission statement for the proposed new command he inserted \\"deployment of troops\\" as a mission, although the change had never been formally requested, the Secretary of the Air Force either allowed it to remain or overlooked it when signing the mission statement. =Lineage= * Established as the Air Corps Ferrying Command on 29 May 1941 : Redesignated Army Air Forces Ferry Command on 9 March 1942 : Redesignated Army Air Forces Ferrying Command on 31 March 1942 : Redesignated Air Transport Command on 1 July 1942 : Discontinued on 1 June 1948 * Consolidated on 13 May 1982 with Military Airlift Command =Assignments= * Office of the Chief of Air Corps, 29 May 1941 * Headquarters, United States Army Air Forces, 9 March 1942 * Headquarters, United States Air Force, 18 September 1947 – 1 June 1948 =Headquarters= * Gravelly Point, Virginia, 29 May 1941 * The Pentagon, Virginia, 15 January 1943 – 1 June 1948Shaw, Frederick J.

(Updated Edition, 2014) =Major Components=Ferrying Division Established 1 July 1942, to replace the Domestic Wing, Army Air Forces Ferrying Command, established 28 December 1941 as the Domestic Division ACFC and redesignated Domestic Wing, AAFFC on 26 February 1942. Initially conducted aircraft ferrying operations within the United States (\\"Zone of the Interior\\") in six regions. The division was reorganized 22 October 1944 into three component ferrying wings (East, West, and Central). The Ferrying Division absorbed the Domestic Transportation Wing (created March 1943 for military passenger and cargo service within the ZI) on 27 November 1944. Operated primarily by civilian contract pilots, including the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP), the Ferrying Division moved aircraft and parts from manufacturing plants in the United States to and between various training bases within the US and to Ports of Embarkation for overseas shipment (Hamilton Field, California; Morrison Field, Florida; Presque Isle Field, Maine; and Anchorage-Elmendorf Field, Alaska). From the Ports of Embarkation, aircraft were flown to final overseas destinations primarily by contracted civil airline pilots or former airline pilots serving in the AAF. The ATC Ferrying Division was also responsible for the preparation for and movement of combat units overseas and for the movement of replacement aircraft and crews, who were temporarily assigned to the ATC Ferrying Division from the time they left the United States until they arrived at their assigned theater. Air Transportation Division Established 28 December 1941 as the Foreign Division, ACFC; redesignated Foreign Wing, AAFFC on 26 February 1942; redesignated Air Transportation Division 1 July 1942. The division was dissolved in March 1943 and its wings placed directly under command of Headquarters ATC. ;North America * Alaskan Wing (redesignated Alaskan Division on 1 July 1944) : Established October 1942. Supported Eleventh Air Force in Alaska and the Aleutian Islands. Controlled the Alaska-Siberia Route (ALSIB) to transport airborne lend-lease aircraft and support material from the Minneapolis, Minnesota and Great Falls, Montana via Central and Western Canada to Ladd Field, Alaska, where Soviet pilots collected the aircraft to fly them westward to air bases in Siberia. Also operated transport route into Northern Canada. ;Central/South America * Caribbean Wing (established as 27th AAF Ferrying Wing 19 June 1942; redesignated Caribbean Wing on 1 July 1942; redesignated Caribbean Division on 1 July 1944) : Transported aircraft, personnel and cargo from South Florida airfields (Morrison Field) to Waller Field, Trinidad over the South Atlantic Route. During World War II, over 16,000 tactical and cargo aircraft transited this route, carrying over 100,000 crew personnel and passengers.

The lakes of the Okanagan Valley were formed by about 8900 BP. Wood Lake is immediately south of Kalamalka Lake and in 1908 was connected to it by a dredged channel (the Oyama canal). Situated between Oyama and Winfield, it has a solid reputation for rainbow trout fishing. The lake is named after Tom Wood, who settled on the south end of the lake around 1860. The dry climate and suitable soil has encouraged development of a substantial tree fruit industry around the lake and throughout the valley. The upper watershed is heavily forested and has been logged for several decades. The lower elevation of the watershed is described as a Ponderosa pine/bunchgrass area.
