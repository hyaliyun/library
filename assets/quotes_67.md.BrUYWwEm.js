United States, 130 U.S. 581 (1889), decided by the United States Supreme Court on May 13, 1889, and better known as the Chinese Exclusion Case, was a case challenging the Scott Act of 1888, an addendum to the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882.. One of the grounds of challenge was that it ran afoul of the Burlingame Treaty of 1868. The Supreme Court rejected the challenge, upholding the authority of the Federal Government of the United States to set immigration policy and pass new legislation that would override the terms of previous international treaties. The decision was an important precedent for the Supreme Court's deference to the plenary power of the United States legislative branches in immigration law and in their authority to overturn the terms of international treaties. Although the term consular nonreviewability would not be used until the 20th century, the case was cited as a key precedent in the defining cases that established the doctrine of consular nonreviewability. As such, it played an important role in limiting the role of the judiciary in shaping immigration to the United States.  The case  = Backdrop of laws = In 1868, the United States and China entered into the Burlingame Treaty, establishing formal friendly relations between the two countries, and granting China most favored nation status. The treaty encouraged immigration from China, and granted some privileges to citizens of either country residing in the other, but withheld the privilege of naturalization for immigrants from China. On November 17, 1880, the Burlingame Treaty was amended to suspend but not prohibit immigration from China. The amendment was called the Treaty Regulating Immigration from China, and historians refer to it as the Angell Treaty of 1880. The prefix stated: \\"The United States, because of the constantly increasing immigration of Chinese labourers to the territory of the United States and the embarrassments consequent upon such immigration now desires to negotiate a modification of the existing Treaties which shall not be in direct contravention to their spirit.\\" In 1882, the Chinese Exclusion Act was passed, forbidding the immigration of skilled and unskilled laborers from China to the United States. The rights of prior immigrants were not significantly amended. An 1884 Amendment to the Chinese Exclusion Act required Chinese citizens to obtain re- entry permits if they wished to return after temporarily leaving the United States. On October 1, 1888, the United States government passed the Scott Act. Authored by William Lawrence Scott of Pennsylvania, the act was signed into law by United States President Grover Cleveland on October 1, 1888. The act forbade re-entry of Chinese immigrants to the United States who would not otherwise be eligible to enter the United States if immigrating for the first time. This went against the privileges that the Burlingame Treaty gave Chinese immigrants to the United States. = Case details = Chae Chan Ping () was a Chinese citizen who had moved to San Francisco, California, in 1875. He worked in the United States from 1875 to June 2, 1887, and then left to visit his homeland of China, after obtaining a certificate that would entitle him to return to the United States. The certificate was issued in accordance with provisions of the Chinese Exclusion Act. On October 1, 1888, while he was outside the United States, the Scott Act became law. This Act forbade his re- entry. Chae Chan Ping departed on his return journey to the United States on September 7, 1888, from Hong Kong, on the steamship Belgic. On October 8, 1888, the ship landed within the port of San Francisco. He requested entry to the United States, presenting his certificate. He was denied entry based on the Scott Act. Captain Walker, the captain of the Belgic, detained Ping on board. A writ of habeas corpus was filed on behalf of Ping, requesting that the captain release him and allow him to be presented in court. The captain complied. Ping appeared before the court, which determined that he was not being deprived of liberty, and returned him to the control of the captain. Ping appealed the order, and the case reached the United States Supreme Court. The arguments for the case were heard by the Court on March 28 and 29, 1889. Ping was represented by Thos. D. Riordan, Harvey S. Brown, George Hoadly, and Jas. C. Carter. Geo. A. Johnson, John F. Swift, and Stephen M. White represented the State of California, and Sol. Gen. Jenks represented the Federal Government of the United States. = Key points of contention = A number of different arguments were made by the lawyers representing Ping, and the Supreme Court's opinion on these arguments would serve an important precedent for future decisions: * The appeal challenged the authority of the United States legislative and executive branches to overturn international treaties, and implicitly claimed that any such overturning was subject to judicial oversight. * The appeal also argued that the right of visitation in a treaty was a form of property protected by the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. * The appeal referenced previous criticisms by legal scholars of the constitutionality of the Alien and Sedition Acts passed in 1798. = Decision = In its decision published on May 13, 1889, the Supreme Court unanimously upheld the decision of the lower court. Justice Stephen Johnson Field, who had risen to the position of Supreme Court justice after serving on the California Supreme Court, penned the opinion of the Court. Field had previously pushed back against legislation such as the Pigtail Ordinance that was de facto discriminatory against the Chinese, courting unpopularity in California.McCloskey, American Conservatism, pp. 109-111. However, his opinion in this case employed rhetoric that was more in line with public sentiment regarding the Chinese at the time, and was consistent with his dissent in Chew Heong v. United States, a related challenge to the Chinese Exclusion Act that was decided against the United States government. Field offered a number of reasons for the Court's decision: # He clarified that the United States Government could pass new legislation overriding the terms of past treaties. In that case, the treaty would be treated only as valid law for the time period before the new legislation became effective. Although there were no direct precedents in the domain of immigration law, Field cited past precedents involving trade treaties, where the government had changed trade laws, negating the terms of previous treaties, and the courts had rejected appeals challenging the change in law. Examples cited included: #* Taylor v. Morton, 67 U.S. 481 (1862):. In this case, the Supreme Court upheld a change in the United States tariff structure on hemp that overrode terms of a treaty between the United States and Russia. #* Whitney v. Robertson, 124 U.S. 190 (1888):. This upheld the United States government's authority to interpret ambiguous treaty terms as it saw fit. # He noted that, when the Burlingame Treaty was amended in 1880, the Chinese government had conceded the authority of the United States to regulate immigration from China. # He noted past precedent in treaties and international diplomatic communication between the United States and other countries, including Switzerland, France, and Mexico, asserting that governments had the authority to regulate immigration in the national interest, and that this authority existed even when the wisdom of particular decisions was in question. # He noted that the judiciary was not the right place to appeal any violation of the terms of international treaties, but rather this was a diplomatic matter for the governments of the respective countries to sort out among themselves.  Relation with other Court cases  = Other Chinese Exclusion Cases = The case is sometimes called the Chinese Exclusion Case, on account of being the most important case directly pertaining to the Chinese Exclusion Act. Some commentators use the term \\"Chinese Exclusion Cases\\" for a collection of cases including this one that were decided in the aftermath of the Chinese Exclusion Act. The five cases were: # Chew Heong v. United States (1884): Heong had lived in the United States and left to visit China before the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act. An Amendment to the Act in 1884 would require all Chinese in the United States to obtain a re-entry permit prior to departure. Heong, who returned to the United States without a permit, was denied re-entry and appealed the decision. The appeal was granted and Heong was allowed to re- enter the country. This is the only one of the five cases that was decided against the United States government. # Chae Chan Ping v. United States (1889) (current page) # Fong Yue Ting v. United States (1893): The Supreme Court upheld the decision of the United States government to deport Fong Yue Ting and two other Chinese residents who were deemed by the United States government to not hold valid residency permits. The decision reaffirmed that the government's power to deport foreigners is an absolute and unqualified right, just like its power to regulate entry. # Lem Moon Sing v. United States (1895): This upheld the decision of the United States Congress in the Geary Act of 1892 to exclude foreigners from entry without any habeas corpus relief. # United States v. Ju Toy (1905): The Supreme Court further allowed Congress to deny the writ of habeas corpus even to persons claiming to be United States citizens. Another related case that was decided somewhat differently is that of United States v. Wong Kim Ark, where the Supreme Court held that a person born in the United States of Chinese citizens legally residing in the United States automatically became a U.S. citizen. The decision established an important precedent in its interpretation of the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. = Value as a precedent for later doctrines in immigration law = In the case, and the subsequent Chinese Exclusion Cases, the Supreme Court repeatedly sided with the United States government and against aliens, offering the rationale that immigration policy and its enforcement were a matter for the legislative and executive branches. Some commentators argue that this case was an important precedent in establishing the plenary power doctrine that immunizes from judicial review the substantive immigration decisions of the United States Congress and the executive branch of the United States government. Others have disagreed about the significance of these cases for plenary power. The defining case for the plenary power doctrine, Knauff v. Shaughnessy (1950) did not explicitly cite the case. Some commentators have also cited the decisions made in the case as having precedential value for the doctrine of consular nonreviewability that would emerge in the latter half of the 20th century, though it was not a direct precedent. Although the case did not touch on the authority of United States consulates, it arguably addressed similar questions: the task of determining whether an individual would be allowed to enter the United States was at the time solely undertaken by the officer at the port of entry, whereas by the middle of the 20th century the main filtering step was done by consular officers evaluating visa applications. The purported significance attached to the case, passed at a time when anti-Chinese sentiment was much greater than now and may have played a role in influencing the court decisions, has been critiqued by commentators and compared to using Dred Scott v. Sandford or Plessy v. Fergusson (decisions whose reasoning has been rejected and that are believed to have been influenced by the greater levels of racism at the time) as precedents.

He is best known for his debut album Held. Music career Holy Other made his debut in 2010 with the release of a 7\\" single, We Over, on Transparent Records.\\"Holy Other – We Over.\\" Discogs. Retrieved 24 October 2015. Shortly after he signed to Tri Angle (record label) and released his debut EP, With U, in 2011. With U was highly acclaimed by music critics, many applauding its unique blend of R&B;, UK Garage, and House Music. Paul Lester, writing for The Guardian, remarked in reference to the EP “remember those stories about Prince being a Cocteau Twins fan? Well, this is what might have resulted had he worked with Robin Guthrie or Kevin Shields”, while Marc Hogan, in his review for Spin Magazine wrote that the EP \\"blasts through not only genres, but the divide between the otherworldly and the physical”. Despite the early hype Holy Other immediately developed a reputation for being a particularly elusive and private artist, rarely divulging personal details about himself and preferring not to be photographed or filmed during interviews. In an interview with Stereogum he explained the mystery surrounding him as a by-product of intense stage fright and an initial desire to keep the project as faceless as possible for as long as possible. In 2012 Holy Other released his debut album, Held, again, on Tri Angle Records. The album garnered very positive reviews and was featured on numerous Best Of lists that year. Ruth Saxelby, in her eight-out-of-ten review for Pitchfork stated \\"his music is of the wholly sensual, painfully physical kind, and with Held he triumphantly translates his bruised intimacy to full-length format without losing any of its skin-prickling power”. In a nine-out-of ten review Mixmag assessed that the album acted \\"as the perfect catalyst for moments of intense intimacy” and in another nine-out-of-ten review FACT Magazine concluded that “in both musical and studio accomplishment Holy Other has come into his own as a strong, individual, musical voice”. Around this time Holy Other was widely recognised as being one of the more important artists in the then fledgling Alternative R&B; scene, although Holy Other himself has never stated any affiliation with the genre. In support of Held Holy Other performed at numerous music festivals around the world and also toured with artists including Beach House, Amon Tobin, and Lucky Dragons.

It was the first \\"live\\" one hour drama on commercial television in Australia. It was shown live in Sydney, recorded and shown later in Melbourne. Australian TV drama was relatively rare at the time. The play was the first episode of Shell Presents, a regular series of Australian dramas. Plot In Nova Scotia, a deaf mute girl is raped. Cast *Kathleen Gorham as Belinda McDonald *James Condon as Dr Davidson *Robina Beard *Kevin Brennan as Black McDonald * Michael Cole as man who assaults Belinda *Eve Hardwicke as the rapists wife *Mark Kelly *Olive Walter *Nellie Lamport *Leonard Lee *John Morris *Nancye Stewart Production It was decided to do this play first as, reportedly, it was the first play for which the rights could be obtained. The story was well known to Australian audiences because of the 1948 film. The rival TCN-9 channel sought an injunction to prevent the play's telecast on the grounds that TCN owned the Australian film rights to this movie, but this was rejected by the courts.McPherson p 163 The adaptation was by Richard Lane who had extensive experience writing radio drama and had written Autumn Affair for Channel Seven. It was produced by Brett Porter and directed by David Cahill. Cahill's wife Keitha Munro was wardobe mistress. The director David Cahill foind it difficult to find to Belinda he was happy with. His wife, a dancer, suggested that a dancer could play the part.McPheron p 163 The role was given to Kathy Gorman, a ballerina who had never had a straight dramatic part before although she had played the title role in a musical, Alice in Wonderland at the Philip St Theatre. Gorham was cast in part because her ballet skills were useful for the miming part of the role. She went to the Adult Deaf and Dumb Society to be coached in sign language. \\"I didn't want to make meaningless gestures\\", said Gorham. \\"I wanted to be completely accurate in everything I did in the part. I went along to an expert and learned the correct signs and movements. I found the language very beautiful. There is a lot of ballet in their movements and gestures.\\" The production was filmed in a studio on four sets. (Another account says three - the interior of the farmhouse, the village street and the inside of a mill.) It was designed by Kelvin Cameron and the construction team was led by Vernon Best. Two studio days were allowed to set up lighting and props prior to camera rehearsal.McPherson p 163 David Cahill praised Brett Porter's role in encouraging using angles and shooting as components of telling a story visually rather than thinking of it as a stage play.McPherson p 164 Len Mauger, then in charge of live productions at Channel Seven, later recalled, \\"It was very satisfying to be associated with the first commercial live play in Australia but it was nerve-racking. People say that video tape makes for better productions nowadays because you can edit and re-record. That's probably true, but video took away that adrenalin, both in the performer and the producer, that said it had to be good because you couldn't go back and do it again.\\" Head of ATN, R. H. Henderson, said the play cost £6,000. He said later dramas cost less but were much more expensive to make than variety shows which could be produced for £2,000 an hour. The cast of 65 was the largest ever for a local television drama. Sponsors agreed to play £3500 for telecast over four states: NSW, Queensland, Victoria and South Australia. Reception The Sydney Morning Herald reported that after the production aired, the switchboard at ATN-7 \\"was jammed for more than half an hour\\" by \\"well-wishers\\" with \\"make-up artists, studio assistants and newsroom reporters helped cope with congratulatory calls\\". =Audience= The audience was estimated at 300,000. =Critical= The TV critic for the Sydney Morning Herald though the production showed the \\"remarkable grip that Australian television artists and technicians are getting upon the problems of telecasting live drama\\" with \\"many of the excitements that belong to a live- show as you might see it in a theatre... all the inimitably exciting bets and gambles and desperate prayers that a live show has.\\" He thought the production did not \\"sink into sentimentality more than once or twice\\" but the one hour time limit did prevent them \\"from establishing some points needed for the integrity of the play as a whole\\", notably the superficial depiction of the rapist and the village gossip. He thought Gorham \\"played the main role sensitively\\" and \\"her mime was fascinating.\\" The TV critic for the Australian Woman's Weekly said, \\"cheers and a long ovation are in order\\" for the production. \\"It was splendidly produced and thoroughly good entertainment\\" in which Gorham \\"gave a first-class performance\\" and James Condon \\"took the acting honors. If it is a sample of what is to come in the scheduled dramas to be presented every month, viewers are lucky indeed.\\" Gorham's performance won her an award. =Influence= The program was highly acclaimed and pointed to the possibilities of local Australian drama production. The chairman of the Elizabethan Theatre Trust, Dr H. C. Coombs, said the introduction by ATN-7 of locally produced plays was a \\"fine idea.\\" He said the encouragement of local talent might help to stem the movement of Australian actors and actresses overseas. The play was discussed in the House of Representatives. L. D. Clay said the play proved beyond a shadow of doubt that Australian actors were equal if not superior to any in the world and asked the Postmaster-General, C. W. Davidson, to ensure that other stations followed ATN 7's example. Davidson said the play was laudable and would certainly be followed by productions by other television stations. J. F. Cope used the play, along with Big, Blue and Beautiful, Thunder of Silence and Other People's Houses in an argument to Parliament in favour of a quota for Australian productions. Many of the same creative team went on to work on the serial The Story of Peter Grey.

The film stars Billie Joe Armstrong in his first leading role, as well as Judy Greer, Selma Blair, Madisyn Shipman, Dallas Roberts, Chris Messina, Fred Armisen, Brian Baumgartner, and Kevin Corrigan. Filming began late 2014 in New York City. The film was originally screened at the Tribeca as Geezer, before its title was changed to Ordinary World, named after a song heard in the film. It is also the closing track on Green Day's 2016 album Revolution Radio, which was released a week earlier.  Plot  In 1995, Perry Miller (Billie Joe Armstrong) performs in New York with his punk band known as The Skunks. His band gives a brief interview before they play their song \\"Devil's Kind\\". 20 years later, Perry and his band have parted. Forced to accept his new life, Miller reluctantly lives his grown-up lifestyle as a father of two with his hard-working lawyer wife Karen (Selma Blair), his talented guitar-playing daughter Salome (Madisyn Shipman) and his newborn child. On his 40th birthday, the same day as his daughter's talent show, Perry is disappointed to notice that nobody has remembered his birthday. After picking up his daughter's new guitar his wife picked out for her, Perry arrives at work at his family's hardware store where his younger brother Jake (Chris Messina) has accepted the main responsibility. His brother chastises him on his constant lethargy at work until Perry reveals to him that his family forgot his birthday. Upset for him, Jake gives Perry the day off and $1000 to do whatever he wishes to, hopeful that giving him a day to relax will allow him to overcome what has been causing his apathy. Perry eventually finds a nice hotel where he plans to throw a reunion party for his band. While waiting to rent a room, Perry runs into Christy (Judy Greer), an old girlfriend of his when he was in the band. She reveals she is now a manager for Joan Jett, who is performing in New York that night. Soon after, Perry rents the presidential suite from the pristine no-nonsense owner (Brian Baumgartner), who firmly reminds him that the hotel has a strict \\"no-party\\" policy. After purchasing the room for the day, he calls his old bandmates; just after they arrive, Perry is reminded by his wife that he must let his in- laws into the house that he forgot about. In his absence, his drummer Gary (Fred Armisen) excitedly invites a stripper and many others into the hotel room. After receiving scornful comments from his wife's parents about his lack of ambition in life, Perry returns to work to fetch Salome's guitar; accidentally, he interrupts a meeting with Jake's lawyer discussing buying out Perry's share of the family business, citing his father's will. Jake tells him that he seems confused in his actions; when he reveals that he has already consulted Karen on the matter, Perry leaves, feeling betrayed. Returning to his hotel room, Perry is enraged to find his room filled with strangers. He angrily confronts Gary, who accuses him of being no fun anymore. Retreating to his room for a nap, he soon wakes up when Christy enters and talks about their past relationship. Perry recalls how his record label dumped him despite him putting much effort into their album; Christy remarks that she loved the record anyway. When she begins making romantic advances, Perry refuses and instead decides to play her a song he wrote: \\"Ordinary World\\", but is interrupted when Gary calls Perry into the main room for a concert. Perry is excited to see his old band formed together again; however, Gary reveals that his position has been replaced with another singer. Infuriated, he smashes Salome's guitar as the police come to stop the party. Perry is handcuffed and confronts Gary about replacing him in the band. Gary says he was forced to when Perry walked out on them because his wife was pregnant, despite a tour already lined up. After being released from custody due to being friends with the police chief, he starts rushing to Salome's talent show; however, Christy runs after him and offers to let him play Ordinary World for Joan Jett, imploring that she will love it. Perry chooses to go to the talent show despite the chance to revive his career. At the talent show, Salome is forced to use Perry's old guitar. Perry is able to make it in time to the show and is elated to see his daughter performing, who performs an acoustic version of \\"Unsatisfied\\" by The Replacements. At home, an angry Karen reveals that his actual birthday is the next day; Perry had confused the dates by thinking his birthday was the same day as the talent show. Karen's parents thank him for loving their daughter so much, and, using a tip from her dad, Perry offers to sleep on the couch. Karen finally forgives him and offers to watch House Hunters. The next day, Perry takes Salome to a guitar shop and trades his prized guitar from his old days for a limited edition electric guitar for her, which Salome is ecstatic about. As they all get into the car, Perry asks what music they should listen to; Salome excitedly tells him to play \\"Devil's Kind\\".

It is a shallow island surrounded by mangroves and tidal flats containing one of the country's last remaining coastal forests. The island is home to the largest population of the endemic and critically endangered Philippine cockatoo in the wild in the Philippines. It was declared a protected area in 2006. Geography Rasa Island is a large irregular mangrove swamp on a coral reef that extends about beyond the island at its southwest and northeast ends. It is located about from Casuarina Point and forms the northeastern side of Mantaquin Bay. Only one-third of the island is permanently dry with the remaining two-thirds exposed to the occasional tides. To its north lie Arena Island and other small coralline islands on the coast of Aborlan. To the south across the Mantaquin Bay are Linda and Emelina islands. Rasa Island is administered as part of the Narra barangay of Panacan. It is just north of the Narra poblacion and approximately south of Palawan's provincial capital, Puerto Princesa. Biodiversity Rasa Island is a natural habitat of the globally threatened Philippine cockatoo, known locally as katala and also known as the red-vented cockatoo, a parrot species endemic to the Philippines. In order to protect this bird species whose number dropped sharply from as many as 4,000 in 1994 to only about 1,000 in 2001 due to illegal poaching and rapid deforestation of its coastal environment, the Philippine government declared the whole island and surrounding waters a bird sanctuary known as Rasa Island Wildlife Sanctuary. The bird sanctuary is now administered by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources in partnership with the Philippine Cockatoo Conservation Program of the Katala Foundation. Former poachers from the Tagbanua community of Narra now serve as the island's deputized wildlife wardens. A number of other endemic birds have also been observed in the island such as the blue-headed racket-tail, grey imperial pigeon, Chinese egret and Mantanani scops owl. Its waters also host a significant population of green sea turtles, hawksbill sea turtles and dugongs. Apart from mangroves, Ipil trees also grow on the island.

Since the late 1980s, he has written lyrics for over 300 songs. He has written more than ten hit songs for Beyond, contributing much to the rock band's reputation, with \\"Lovers\\"《情人》, \\"The Great Wall\\" 《長城》, and \\"The Earth\\" 《大地》, all of which have become band classics. He was known as the Queen lyricist of Beyond, after writing 23 songs for the group. He has also collaborated with other artists such as Jacky Cheung, Eason Chan, Leon Lai and Danny Summer.  Early life  Growing up, Lau read political magazines, watched western movies, listened to rock and roll music, and developed an understanding of the history of modern China. In the 1980s, he lived in a public housing estate in Hong Kong.  Music career  After graduating from secondary school, he became the editor of entertainment magazine Modern Teenage Weekly《現代青年人周報》. He also set up a music production company in Foshan and participated in the production in the songs \\"Nothing\\"《一無所有》and \\"I Understand' 《不是我不明白》by Cui Jian. In 1986, he participated in a Cantopop lyrics competition, held by the RTHK and sponsored by Taiwanese producer Shou-Chuan Lee. Lau's entry, \\"The Unspeakable Future\\" 《說不出的未來》, won the competition and the song was given to singer Danny Summer to perform. Shortly before he had interviewed the band Beyond in 1983 after it had won a band competition held by Guitar Magazine《吉它雜誌》. Given his newly found fame, he offered to write the first song for Beyond, \\"Modern Stage\\" 《現代舞台》, but it did not gain much traction. However, Lau's second song for the band, \\"The Earth\\"《大地》 topped the RTHK charts and brought the band the 1st Top Ten Chinese Gold Songs Award. In 1990 he founded a Chinese record company called Earth Records (大地唱片). He took on the role of producer and coordinator, with his duties including the selection of songs, writing of lyrics, arranging of songs, and recording and remixing of tracks. He produced many songs for famous singers in China. Folksongs in campus《校園民謠》was released in 1994 and set off a wave of folk songs in China. In the 2000s, due to the influx of capital in the music industry, there was not much room for small and medium enterprises. Meanwhile, Lau did not want to co- operate with other record companies, so he retired to Zhuhai for five years. Currently, he has been devising a website to prompt the development of music by the Internet.  Life as a lyricist  Lau said he wanted to be a rock guitarist when he was young but accidentally became a lyricist. Writing lyrics has given him a steady income over the past 20 years. Being a lyricist is a part-time job for Lau because for each song, a lyricist usually only receives HKD$1500–5000. This is only for those who have taken the advance payment, meaning that taking $5000 before receiving the rest of royalties. He tried not to receive “advance” for two years but realized he could not earn a living by writing a song for a few hundred dollars. Unlike famous singers, lyricists cannot count on the royalties from several classics while they have to produce a large number of songs.  Reaction to the Tiananmen Square massacre  At an early age, he often read biographies of political figures, and had a positive impression of the Chinese Communist Party. The violent dispersing of the crowd of students in Tiananmen Square on 4 June 1989 caused Lau to become disillusioned with the party. Taking part in a demonstration in Hong Kong supporting the students in China before June 4, he felt defeated in their effort to reform the government and hence, lost faith in political demonstrations as a means of activism. Instead, he began to write more political songs. Many of his later works revolve around a political theme including \\"Time Flies\\" (歲月無聲), \\"The Great Wall\\" (長城) and \\"Never Forget it-June 4\\" (漆黑將不再面對). These songs are still sung during the annual Memorials for the 1989 protests in Hong Kong, and were also used during the Moral and National Education protests and the Umbrella Revolution.  Publication of his second book  輝常傷感 is a collection of his essays on his moments with Beyond, Cui Jian, He Yong, Lo Ta-yu, Su Rui, and Donnie Yen. It also details the life of being a lyricist and reflects on the changes of modern China and other social issues. The book starts with how he views nature and role of being a lyricist. He mentions that he cannot write lyrics only for his own entertainment and quite often he has to compromise with producers of record company concerning the style and diction. Later on, when writing lyrics becoming part of his income, he has to struggle even more between his own thoughts and the market needs. He frequently emphasizes, in the book, that he has little love experience and thus writing love is a challenge for him. Yet, he does have a few times of having a crush into some girls and so he managed to write a few songs for Jacky Cheung about it. The last session of the book is written by many other musical worker who talk about Lau, including the style of his lyrics, the supplementary information of being a lyricist, comparison between different lyricists, and Lau's contribution of bringing songs from prospective mainland singers.  Style and influence  Due to his teenage experience and exposure, he cares much for society but developed a little sense of melancholy in his political view. This can be seen in most of his works and also leads to more criticisms on politics, show business, and life. As a result, there are relatively fewer collections for other topics, though he had a few well-noted love songs like Always Be There《只想一生跟你走》,Cantabile Years《歲月如歌》, My Darling《我的親愛》. This attitude or orientation has influenced Beyond heavily. Previously, Beyond wrote songs more about personal matter and their frustration on their music path, but Lau's ideas broadened their range of themes. Lau says that love songs dominate the market of Hong Kong, with Albert Leung and Wyman Wong being two major lyricists after the 1990s, especially songs that focus on being lovesick. However, except most of his rebellious and rock songs with Beyond, Lau still possesses his distinctive signature style in his love songs such as Cantabile Years《歲月如歌》and I Come from Beijing《我來自北京》. He demonstrates his personal style by incorporating cultural and political sense in both songs respectively. In an interview, Lau admitted that he was not the kind of lyricist that he would write anything for singers as long as they wanted but what he wanted to convey.

He was the bishop when Protestantism was making the first inroads into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and took the first steps in combating it. John was an illegitimate son of Sigismund I the Old, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, and his mistress Katarzyna Telniczanka. Early life John was born in 1499, well before Sigismund's first marriage to Barbara Zápolya in 1512. In July 1510, John's father received papal dispensation to remove defectus natalium, recognize him as a legitimate son, and ennoble him. John was granted the title \\"of the Lithuanian Dukes\\" around 1514 and used a version of the Lithuanian coat of arms. John became canon in Kraków in 1510 and in Poznań in 1516. John was a student at Kraków Academy and University of Bologna. In 1519, at the age of 21, John was nominated Bishop of Vilnius by his father. Long-term canon of Vilnius John Filipowicz was nominated to become Bishop of Kiev. Pope Leo X confirmed the nomination even though John was not yet ordained as priest (it happened only in 1531) and the Third Council of the Lateran required bishops to be at least 30 years of age. John was accompanied by his mother, who interfered in diocesan affairs. John and his mother faced a lot of opposition in Vilnius; he was even physically attacked and injured by Stanisław, son of Grand Chancellor Mikołaj II Radziwiłł. That prompted the pope to place John under the tutelage of Bishops of Kraków and Lutsk. Bishop of Vilnius Despite the difficulties, John issued a new statute of Vilnius cathedral chapter in 1520, called the first known diocesan synod in 1520 or 1521, and, with pope's permission, created two new prelates of the cathedral chapter (in charge of scholastics and choir) in 1522. John also received papal legate Zacharias Ferrerius sent to investigate canonization of Saint Casimir after a miracle attributed to him during the Siege of Polotsk (1518). John paid attention to education. In 1522, he revised the curriculum of the Cathedral School of Vilnius to include rhetoric, dialectics, classical literature, arithmetic, music. In 1526 or 1527, John called the second diocesan synod which debated three major topics: improper behavior by priests, proper procedures of church services, and establishment of schools. The results of the proceedings were published in Kraków in 1528. The synod decided that each parish church should have a school that would instruct children in both Polish and Lithuanian languages. The synod also forbade hiring German teachers or traveling priests as they could be influenced by Lutheranism. His father Sigismund I the Old gifted John with Šiauliai in 1524, Zhytomyr in 1525, and Kremenets in 1529. That was enough to make him a very wealthy magnate – the military census of 1528 placed him the ninth wealthiest. He funded repairs and reconstruction of Vilnius Cathedral and its belfry (architect Adam Annus). In June 1530, a large fire devastated Vilnius Cathedral. The repairs were slow and Italian architects Bernardino Zanobi de Gianotis and Giovanni Cini were hired only in July 1534. John sponsored construction of a new church in Šiauliai in 1526. He established new parishes and built churches in Joniškis (named so after himself), Gervyaty, and Zarasai. In total, during his tenure as Bishop of Vilnius, more than 30 new churches were built in the diocese. On 18 October 1529, John crowned his half-brother Sigismund II Augustus as Grand Duke of Lithuania. In June 1535, John was appointed overseer of Vilnius Mint when it temporarily reopened during the Muscovite–Lithuanian War. In March 1536, Queen Bona Sforza, who disliked John, managed to get John removed from Vilnius to the Diocese of Poznań. He died there just two years later but, according to his last will, he was buried in Vilnius Cathedral. A new chapel, known as the Chapel of Bishops or Chapel of the Holy Sacrament, was built according to his last will around 1548. His tomb monument of Pińczów limestone was ordered by his brother Sigismund Augustus in 1556. It was designed by Giovanni Maria Mosca also known as Padovano, but did not survive.

The series ran from December 11, 1945 until January 21, 1966. Together with Marten Toonder's Tom Poes and Hans G. Kresse's Eric de Noorman it is considered to be the among the Big Three in the history of Dutch comics.  Concept  Kapitein Rob is a sea captain. He owns a sailing ship nicknamed De Vrijheid (The Freedom) and an invention called \\"Historisch Oog\\" (\\"Historical Eye\\"), which allows him to travel back in time and have adventures in previous centuries involving pirates and explorers. Among the historical characters he encountered are Olivier van Noort and Jan van Riebeeck. Fantasy elements were also prominent in the series. In one story Rob was confronted with the legendary phantom ship The Flying Dutchman. In some stories Rob's ship even leaves the sea and travels into outer space. In Het Geheim van de Bosplaat Rob discovers a secret bunker on the isle of Terschelling, where nazi's plan their evil schemes.  Characters  * Kapitein Rob: A young, brave and smart pipe smoking sea captain. Rob started sailing in May 1940, when he was 21 years old.

Like all Dutch comics in the 1940s and 1950s Kapitein Rob was a text comic, where the text was written below the images. This allowed the stories to be represented as Rob's personal captain's log. The comic strip was a huge success and published in oblong format. Apart from \\"Het Parool\\" Rob's adventures were also published in the \\"Ketelbinkiekrant\\" (1948–1957) and his own magazine, titled \\"Kapitein Rob's Vrienden\\" (\\"Captain Rob's Friends\\") (1949–1952), later renamed as: \\"Rob's Vrienden\\" (\\"Rob's Friends\\") (1952–1957). The stories were also quite successful in Belgium at the time and were translated in German and French. The series ran from December 11, 1945 until January 21, 1966. The script of the first story was written by Wijnanda Aberson. Evert Werkman took over from the second story on. The series was only interrupted twice. From April 4, 1955 until September 1, 1956 and from November 8, 1958 until August 25, 1959. After Kuhn died of a heart attack in 1966 the series were terminated. In total 73 stories were published. The final one was left unfinished. In 2001 the entire series were republished completely by Rijperman Communications.

One chain is linked with Shaykh Ahmad Sirhindi who is also described as Mujaddid Alf Thaani (reviver of the second millennium); his chain is called Naqshbandia Mujaddidia. The other chain was associated with his contemporary Sufi saint Syedna Ameer Abul-Ula Ahrari. A resident of Agra, Ameer Abul-Ula was a descendant of the Sufi saint Khwaja Ubaidullah Ahrar. It is because of his name that this chain is known as Naqshbandia Abul-Ulaiya.  Birth and family lineage  Munim Pak was born in ( 1082 hijiri/ 1671AD) in the village, Pachna, Shaikhpura, Bihar. His family linage meets up with Makhdoom Shamsuddin Haqqani who is one of the great sufi of his time, was disciple of Ibrahim bin Adham Balkhi.  Education and spiritual training  Having completed his primary education at his paternal village he went to Deewan Syed Abu Sayeed Jaafer Muhammad Quadri's khanqah at Barh district near Patna, for higher education and knowledge of Sufism. After his death Munim Pak received knowledge from his son Deewan Syed Khaleeluddin and became his \\"murid\\" (disciple) under Quadria Qutubia order and was rewarded with \\"Khilafah\\". After finishing his education he moved to Delhi with the instruction and permission of his \\"peer\\". or around forty years he taught the students of higher education at the Madrasa situated behind the Jama Masjid in Delhi.  Abul Ulai lineage  Munem Pak went to Sufi saint Khwaja Shah Muhammad Farhad and dedicated himself fully to his service. Biographers say that he remained there in his service for eleven years, practising the spiritual teachings of Naqshbandia Abul-Ulaiya Silsilah. Shah Farhad’s peer, Syed Dost Muhammad Burhanpuri, was a mureed and khalifa of Syedna Ameer Abul-Ula. He was close to Bade Peer Syedna Shaykh Abdul Quadir Jeelani and Makhdoom-e-Jahan Shaykh Sharafuddin Ahmad Yahya Maneri.  Nature and conduct  He often fasted, not just during the month of Ramadhan when it is required. He never built a house, married, or settled down.  Spiritual succession of Meer Syed Asadullah  After Shah Farhad died in 1145 Hijri, Munem Pak benefitted from his mureed (disciple), khalifah (caliph) and successor Meer Syed Asadullah and when Meer Syed Asadullah died in 1147 Hijri, Munim Pak was enthroned as inheritor of Shah Farhad.  Migration from Delhi to Patna  After several years in Delhi, he received indication from the Islamic prophet Muhammad to migrate to Patna. In Patna, he initially stayed at Meer Taqi mosque near Meetanghat and then came to Mulla Meetan’s mosque, known as \\"Jama Masjid Mulla Meetan\\" and his khanqah got established here. He died on the eleventh day of Rajab in 1185 Hijri (AD 1771), at the age of about 103 and was buried next to Jama Masjid Mulla Meetan. A simple mausoleum was built there, which was later expanded and enhanced.  Spiritual Life  After arriving in Patna he went to Bihar sharif and stayed there for three months meditating near the mausoleum of the Sufi saint Makhdoom-e-Jahan Shaykh Sharfuddin Ahmad Yahya Maneri.  Followers  The total number of khanqahs (abbeys) associated with this Silsila, spread across India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Burma and Sri Lanka, would be around 150 and the number of devotees and people associated with them would come to crores. According to the contemporary Sufi literature, it was believed that he presented himself in the assembly of Muhammad. That is why he was also known as \\"Haazir-e- Bargah-e- Laulak\\" (present before Muhammad).  Works  He wrote three books during his stay in Delhi, \\"Mukashifat-e-Munemi\\", \\"Ilhamat-e- Munemi\\" and \\"Mushahidat-e-Munemi\\" in 1119 Hijri, 1120 Hijri and 1123 Hijri respectively. The manuscripts of \\"Ilhamat-E-Munemi\\" and \\"Mukashifat-E-Munemi\\" are available at Khudabakhsh Library, Patna and other libraries of the subcontinent. The manuscripts of \\"Mushahidat-E-Munemi\\" are not so widely available.  Nature of his Khanqah  Everybody was welcomed at his khanqah, be he Sufi or Yogi (hermit), Hindu or Muslim. He treated his mureeds (disciples) affectionately. A Hindu Yogi who was a follower of Guru Nanak and whose name was Gurbakhsh came to him and made a request. He explained that he was a devotee of Krishna and that he had been earnestly willing for a long time to catch a glimpse of him. He also mentioned that he had traveled all over the country, met a lot of reputed Yogis but nobody could help him make his dream come true. He urged that he had heard many a thing about him and came to him with lot of hope. Munim Pak and the yogi meditated; after a while the yogi got up and started dancing until he fainted and fell down. He said that when he meditated he felt as if he had reached Vrindavan and there he saw Krishna with his eyes. He said that Krishna was playing the flute which produced the sound \\"Laa Ilaha Illallah Muhammadur Rasoolullah\\", Gopis were dancing and the environment was full of frolic. He affirmed that seeing all this he also got enraptured and started dancing. Thereafter, he became a disciple of Munim Pak and attained accomplishment.  Prominent Khalifas  During his stay at Delhi and Patna, many people became his Mureed (disciples), some of them attained accomplishment and became his Khalifa (caliphs). Notable disciples (mureeds) of Makhdoom Munim Pak are Quazi Maulana Hassan Raza Khan Raipuri, Sayed Dayem (Dhaka, Bangladesh) the Ustaad-e-Shahr of Patna Mulla Shoaibul Haque Musafir, the renowned teacher of calligraphy Shah Izzuddin, Khairuddin Kashmiri and Shah Quamar Ali, the younger brother of Shah Kamal Dewarvi. Makhdoom Munim Pak died in the evening at the time of Isha after the day of 11 Rajab in 1185 Hijri. His abbey (khanqah) is at Meetanghat, Patna City and his grave is situated in the premises of Mulla Meetan's mosque. As per his will, Maulana Hassan Raza Raipuri became his first Sajjada Nasheen. With the permission of Syed Shah Quamruddin Hussain Munemi, his tomb (Maqbara) was constructed for the first time by Sufi Shah Dilawar Ali Lahori in 1249 Hijri. In 1285 Hijri, during the period of Syed Shah Muneeruddin Husain Munemi Sajjada Nasheen his Tomb was renovated by Shah Aleemuddin Raipuri. Syed Shah Salimuddin Ahmad Munemi also got the tomb renovated when he served as the Sajjada Nasheen. The magnificent dome of his tomb got ready in 2010. Devotees belonging to all religions and faith can be seen paying their tributes here everyday. Next to his Dargah at Khanquah Munemia, there stands the grand historical mosque called ‘Jama Masjid Mulla Meetan’. It is very large and the only double storeyed mosque of the Mughal period in Bihar. Mulla Meetan was an eminent scholar (Aalim) and renowned Sufi of the Aurangzeb Era. Mulla Meetan's Masjid is a unique example of the architectural expertise of that era. This is the place which enjoys the privilege of being Munim Pak's place of worship. Makhdoom Pak used to teach his caliphs the lessons of meditation and penance here. Next to his grave (dargah shareef), towards the north, there is a beautiful and grandiose building of Khanquah Munemia. This is also an exquisite example of architecture.

This organisation focuses on scouting of expatriate Iraqi sportspersons and sportspersons of Iraqi origin and presenting them to the Iraqi sports fans and to the Iraqi media and promotes the best out of them to represent the Iraqi National Teams. The Start This Project was started by Akam Qader, who is an Iraqi engineer in The USA back in 2010, after a series of bad results of the Iraq national football team. Akam Qader was inspired by the philosophy of the Algerian Football Federation of bringing players of Algerian origins who play in Europe to the Algeria national football team to enhance the quality of the team, which saw them qualify to the FIFA World Cup and perform very well in their games. Akam with few friends decided to start this project online mainly through the famous Arabic sports website www.kooora.com and through its forum \\"منتدى كوووره عراقية\\" (translated: Iraqi Sports Forum). So along with Yousif Alkhafajy and few more members the search for players of Iraqi origin started. The Website The year 2011 saw a new development in this project; the launch of their official old website www.iraqi-players.com. The website was launched by Yousif Alkhafajy, who then became the C.E.O. founder months later, and it became the first website in Iraq specialised for the database and news of Iraqi expatriate sportspersons and sportspersons of Iraqi origin. Getting Attention In 2011, the group collected information about few players of Iraqi origin playing in European Leagues and they delivered the information with photos and videos of the players to the then- Iraq national football team manager Wolfgang Sidka who loved the idea and decided to go to Europe and watch the performance of the players with their clubs. Among those players were David Haidar , Yaser Kasim , Ahmed Yasin Ghani, Osama Rashid, Shwan Jalal , Anmar Almubaraki and Murad Kurdi. The First Official Callup In June 2011, the coach Wolfgang Sidka, decided to call few players to the national team for tryouts, and he formed a team which was called \\"Iraqi European Team\\" which consisted of Iraqi Expateiate Players and young stars from the Iraqi Premier League and then the Iraqi European team played games against few Iraqi clubs. In July 2011, Osama Rashid became the first footballer of Iraqi origin to represent Iraq national football team when he came as a second-half substitute in the game against Kuwait national football team in FUCHS Championship. Though Rashid's official papers were not ready, he was allowed to play for the reason that the tournament was a friendly championship. At the end of 2011, Ahmed Yasin Ghani became the first footballer of Iraqi origin to officially play for Iraq in a FIFA tournament after being called by the Iraqi u23 football team manager Radhi Shenaishil when he represented the Iraqi U23 football team in the game against UAE olympic football team during the 2012 Summer Olympics qualifiers. In April 2012 with efforts from Iraqi Professional Players and help from Iraq Football Association and after a year of struggle, Osama Rashid's papers were successfully transferred by the FIFA from the Royal Dutch Football Association to the Iraq Football Association as he had previously represented Netherlands up to the u19 level, making Osama the first case of FIFA eligibility transfer in the history of Iraqi Football. In June 2012, Ahmed Yasin became the first footballer of Iraqi origin to officially represent the Iraq senior football team when he came as a second-half substitute against Lebanon national football team during the Arab Nations Cup held in Saudi Arabia. And later in 2012, he became the first player of Iraqi origin to play for Iraq in a FIFA World Cup Qualification game, followed by Osama Rashid and David Haider. Following Years After their remarkable success in the first 2 years by providing the Iraqi national football team with players like Ahmed Yasin, Osama Rashid and David Haidar, the project starting spreading its wings wider to cover the whole globe with their scouting network. Though the project was attacked as well as demoralised by many people, but the project kept their hardwork going and by 2014 they were able to discover more than 70 players of Iraqi origin in different parts of the globe and by 2015 they have a database of more than 200 players of Iraqi origin. Official Recognition by The FA In 2014, the Iraq Football Association released an official statement, making the Iraqi Professional Players the official and the only database of the Sportspersons of Iraqi origin or the Iraqi expatriate sportspersons. Making Wider Scouting Network By 2015, after the success they gained in providing footballers to the Iraqi National Football Teams and the agegroup teams, the project decided to start scouting other in sports, and they were successful to scout talents in sports like Wrestling, Boxing, Weight Lifting, Futsal, Basketball, Swimming, and many other sports. Awards and Recognitions 2014- Officially recognised by the Iraq Football Association as the only source for database of Iraqi origin sportspersons in the world. 2014- Attaining recognition from AFC 2015- Voted by the fans as the Best Website for The Database and News of Iraqi Professio al Sportspersons in a poll conducted by Iraqi Sports Network. 2015- The Coca-Cola Company becomes the official sponsor of Iraqi Professional Players http://www.iq-pro.net References Category:Sports organizations of Iraq Category:2010 establishments ","title":"Iraqi Professional Players"},{"id":"48357610","text":"Sir Thomas Peckham (1691-1724) was an English landowner who served as High Sheriff of Sussex.

Running a solo practice from her home between 1946 and 1981, she designed dozens of buildings and renovations, mostly residential, on Sydney's North Shore. Early life and education Cullis-Hill was born Eleanor Beresford Grant in 1913 in Warrawee, New South Wales, a suburb of Sydney. Her father was Joseph Beresford Grant, a businessman in real estate. She attended Frensham School in Mittagong and went on to study architecture at the University of Sydney. She graduated in 1938. Career Cullis-Hill began working as a professional architect after the Second World War. In a contract position with the New South Wales Housing Commission, she designed houses as part of Sydney's postwar reconstruction boom. She set up a solo practice in 1946 at her own home in Warrawee, since she felt that women architects were unwelcome in large firms. Initially, she accepted commissions from friends, and through word-of-mouth recommendations she received enough projects to keep her in full-time work. Cullis-Hill worked mainly on Sydney's North Shore in the suburbs of Warrawee and Wahroonga, but she also designed residential renovations and houses in East Killara, Hunters Hill, Kenthurst, Pymble and Turramurra. In total, she designed more than 30 houses and around 50 residential alterations. She also designed church and school buildings: these included additions to Gib Gate School in Mittagong (1954–1973) and St James' Anglican Church in Turramurra (1957–1975) as well as the original plans for Wahroonga Nursery School (1954–1955) and the Turramurra Nursery School (1961). Her design for the Wahroonga Nursery School was shortlisted for the Australian Institute of Architects' Sulman Award in 1956. Cullis-Hill retired in 1981 and died in 2001. Family In 1938 she married Grandison Cullis-Hill, a fellow architecture student at the University of Sydney. They had four children—Caroline, Josephine, Mary and David—and lived in a house on Bangalla Street in Warrawee that she designed. Her two eldest daughters, Caroline Martin and Josephine Roberts, also became architects.

In 2014 Butterfield set a European record in the club while winning the event at the 2014 IPC Athletics European Championships. The following year she added the World title at the 2015 IPC Athletics World Championships in Qatar, securing a place at the 2016 Paralympic Games. Personal history Butterfield was born in Yorkshire, England in 1979, but later moved to Glasgow in Scotland. In 2011, she was diagnosed with a spinal tumor which resulted in her being paralysed below the waist. Sports career During her rehabilitation at a spinal unit in Glasgow, Butterfield was introduced to the sport of wheelchair rugby. In early 2012 she joined the Caledonian Crushers, and later became their vice-captain. In 2014 Butterfield was classified as a F51 disability athlete and began competing in regional meets in both the discus and club throw events. In August that year she was selected for the Great Britain team to compete at the 2014 IPC Athletics European Championships. There she competed in the F32/51 club throw, and set a new European record with a distance of 17.68m winning gold in all British podium alongside Josie Pearson and Gemma Prescott. That season she also competed at the SDS Championships in Perth and threw personal bests in both the discus (9.79m) and the club (19.50m), winning gold in both events. The following year Butterfield travelled to Dubai to take part in the Fazaa International, the first IPC Grand Prix of the year. In the F32/33/51 discus she threw 8.87m to win the competition and beat the previous F51 European record by 27 centimetres. She also improved on her European record in the club with a throw of 19.69 which saw her take gold. In July Butterfield competed in her third IPC Grand Prix of the year, held at Olympic Park in London. A throw of 21.50 in the club not only gave her the title, but improved on her European title to take her within 40 cm of American Rachael Morrison's world record. Morrison was Butterfield's main rival when the two met at the 2015 IPC Athletics World Championships in Doha. In the club Butterfield threw 21.44 to set a championship record and push her American rival into silver medal place. But it was Morrison on top when they met a few days later in the T52 discus throw, with Butterfield coming third behind Morrison and Mexico's Leticia Ochoa Delgado. Though Butterfield's distance of 8.96m was a new European record for a F51 athlete.

Life  Spinelli was born Anita Corti, in Balerna, Ticino Switzerland in 1908, the third child of four to Gemma and Gaetano Corti. She was initiated to art quite early. Her father, a businessman in wine making, patronised several artists. After middle school she attended the Arts and Crafts School in Lugano and Guido Gonzato's studio.Claudo Nembrini (2002) p 73. Defying conventions and her family, she registered at the Brera Academy of Art in Milan, attended Aldo Carpi's special courses in painting and graduated in 1933. During this period she immersed herself in the buoyant artistic life of Milan, travelled to Paris and Vienna and visited Assisi, where she lived in the monastery to study Giotto's frescos. In 1932 she married Paolo Spinelli, a civil servant and landowner with whom she had two daughters. They moved to the mansion of Pignora, Novazzano in Ticino, where she lived and worked for most of her life.Brazzola (2008) She became an active member of the Society of Swiss Artists, Sculptors and Architects and set out her place in an artistic scene dominated by men. Invited to the XIX and XX National Art Exhibits of 1936 and 1941 her work was remarked on for her innovative mode of expression.Kornelia Imesch. The artist on Herself in her Work. Woman and Femininity as a Theoretical Model in the Work of Anita Spinelli, In: Cristina Brazzola (2008), p 159. She had her first solo exhibit in 1938 in Lausanne. To overcome regional and cultural isolation she engaged after World War Two until the 1990s in extended travelling in the Mediterranean Basin and Europe, Africa, Central America and China with repeated and prolonged stays in the US. These travels were important sources of inspiration and have influenced her perception of light and space, which are central elements of her art.Angela Regli, Cristina Donati ed.(2004), Brazzola (2008) p 179. During her stay in Mainz, Germany, in the early 1970s she took up engraving techniques again, neglected since art school, and through her novel approach this became a significant part of her work. Later on, Spinelli also engaged in art-science projects initiated by the Lausanne University department of neurology with the task to render and visualize neurological disorders, medical gestures and different forms of pain through her artistic approach. The themes treated were \\"The Hand in Neurology\\" (1987), \\"Dizziness and Mouvement\\" (1995), \\"HeadacheHeadaches and Faces\\" (1992) and resulted in several exhibits and publications. The confrontation of two fundamentally different dimensions of reality (the scientific approach that aims at evidence, and the artistic and sensitive approach that elicits the invisible but maintains a mystery) paradoxically revealed certain complementaries and the capacity of art to shed light on scientific phenomena and vice versa.René Berger in Caroline de Watteville ed. L'Art et la culture au CHUV.25 ans d'activité pionnière, Lausanne, 2009 pp 60–64. (in French) She regularly showed her work in personal and collective exhibitions in institutional and private spaces. In 2002 a permanent display of her work has been created at the \\"Quadreria\\" in Novazzano, Ticino. Her last major retrospective was organized by the Museum of Art of Lugano in 2008. Anita Spinelli died on 24 March 2010 in Mendrisio of the consequences of an accident that occurred in her studio.Addio ad Anita Spinelli , Corriere del Ticino 25 March 2010 (in Italian) She had continued to create art until her death. Her work is represented in museums, as well as in institutional and private collections in Switzerland and elsewhere.  Work  Spinelli's media were mainly oil paintings of different formats, engravings and mixed techniques, in which she elaborated her graphic work with colour and ink. In the large oil formats of her latter period she deployed diptychs and triptychs.Kornelia Imesch In: Brazzola (2008) pp163Walter Schönenberger in: Angela Regli, Maria Cristina Donati (2004), p 7. Spinelli's work explores individual and societal questions that characterized her long life as an actor and witness of the 20th and early 21st century. She appears to have attached a central importance to the human figure caught in everyday situations and attitudes. Her work roots in reality, an everyday reality that she transforms through imaginative accelerations into figures,Flaminio Gualdoni in: Cristina Brazzola (2008), p 153. mental figures, to capture another more hidden reality.Walter Schönenberger in: Maria Cristina Donati (2008), p 8. According to Berger, Spinelli's work can be read on at least three levels of analysis: the first is her look that is not purely visual but involves participation; a further level, is that of self-reflection – she takes position with humour or irony, with joy or grief; on a third level, she elaborates existential questions.René Berger In : Regli Angela (1988), p 21. The quests and existential conditions, which encompass the very essence of human life, make up the core of her subjects: hope, joy but also loneliness, silence, memory, fear, separation, oppression, war and hardship.Kornelia Imesch In: Brazzola (2008), p. 161. She expresses the interior sentience of being. In Spinelli's words: > \\"It is silent, curious listening: a search for the essence of the object, > stripped of the superfluous, with hard work and without complacency. To make > art means to me being alive among the living. My characters are myself. With > them I share the load of good and evil. You cannot cheat.\\"Franco Regli In: > Claudio Nembrini, Angela Regli ed. Anita Spinelli – la quadreria e altre > opere. 2002, p. 38. Her work spanning over almost a century, Spinelli has addressed and analysed the formal debates of her time. She explored from metaphysics to post-cubist deconstruction, from expressionism to abstractionism (in particular abstract expressionism) to new forms of figuration, however never adhering completely to any one of these positions. Rather she synthesized and bent them freely to her needs. Spinelli developed a pictorial code characterized by vivid chromatics, dynamism, a wide freedom and complexity in composition, determined by simultaneity and disruption of perspective, where the figure emerges from an abstract spatiality. Spinelli's language is considered expressionist in nature, but where a visionary spirit superposes or coexists with the tragic element. In her last period, her color-light rarefies to a metaphysical dimension of pure light, transparency and lightness. Her novel approaches, the sense of freedom and of expressive possibilities together with a constant poetic and ethical tension mark her contribution to the art world.

Rockites, similar to the earlier Whiteboys, targeted the English and Anglo-Irish Feudal landowners.

The hard tissues of humans are bone, tooth enamel, dentin, and cementum. The term is in contrast to soft tissue. Bone Bone is a rigid organ that constitutes part of the vertebral skeleton. Bones support and protect the various organs of the body, produce red and white blood cells, store minerals and also enable mobility. Bone tissue is a type of dense connective tissue. Bones come in a variety of shapes and sizes and have a complex internal and external structure. They are lightweight yet strong and hard, and serve multiple functions. Mineralized osseous tissue or bone tissue, is of two types – cortical and cancellous and gives it rigidity and a coral- like three-dimensional internal structure. Other types of tissue found in bones include marrow, endosteum, periosteum, nerves, blood vessels and cartilage. Bone is an active tissue composed of different cells. Osteoblasts are involved in the creation and mineralisation of bone; osteocytes and osteoclasts are involved in the reabsorption of bone tissue. The mineralised matrix of bone tissue has an organic component mainly of collagen and an inorganic component of bone mineral made up of various salts. Enamel Enamel is the hardest substance in the human body and contains the highest percentage of minerals,Ross et al., p. 485 96%, with water and organic material composing the rest.Ten Cate's Oral Histology, Nancy, Elsevier, pages 70-94 The primary mineral is hydroxyapatite, which is a crystalline calcium phosphate. Enamel is formed on the tooth while the tooth is developing within the gum, before it erupts into the mouth. Once fully formed, it does not contain blood vessels or nerves. Remineralisation of teeth can repair damage to the tooth to a certain degree but damage beyond that cannot be repaired by the body. The maintenance and repair of human tooth enamel is one of the primary concerns of dentistry. In humans, enamel varies in thickness over the surface of the tooth, often thickest at the cusp, up to 2.5 mm, and thinnest at its border with the cementum at the cementoenamel junction (CEJ).Ten Cate's Oral Histology, Nanci, Elsevier, 2013, page 122 The normal color of enamel varies from light yellow to grayish (bluish) white. At the edges of teeth where there is no dentin underlying the enamel, the color sometimes has a slightly blue tone. Since enamel is semitranslucent, the color of dentin and any material underneath the enamel strongly affects the appearance of a tooth. The enamel on primary teeth has a more opaque crystalline form and thus appears whiter than on permanent teeth. The large amount of mineral in enamel accounts not only for its strength but also for its brittleness.Ten Cate's Oral Histology, Nanci, Elsevier, pages 70-94 Tooth enamel ranks 5 on Mohs hardness scale and has a Young's modulus of 83 GPa. Dentin, less mineralized and less brittle, 3–4 in hardness, compensates for enamel and is necessary as a support.Johnson On radiographs, the differences in the mineralization of different portions of the tooth and surrounding periodontium can be noted; enamel appears lighter than dentin or pulp since it is denser than both and more radiopaque.Illustrated Dental Embryology, Histology, and Anatomy, Bath- BaloghFehrenbach, Elsevier, 2011, page 180 Enamel does not contain collagen, as found in other hard tissues such as dentin and bone, but it does contain two unique classes of proteins: amelogenins and enamelins. While the role of these proteins is not fully understood, it is believed that they aid in the development of enamel by serving as a framework for minerals to form on, among other functions. Once it is mature, enamel is almost totally without the softer organic matter. Enamel is avascular and has no nerve supply within it and is not renewed, however, it is not a static tissue as it can undergo mineralization changes.Bath-Balogh, Fehrenbach, p. 179 Dentin By weight, 70% of dentin consists of the mineral hydroxyapatite, 20% is organic material, and 10% is water. Yellow in appearance, it greatly affects the color of a tooth due to the translucency of enamel. Dentin, which is less mineralized and less brittle than enamel, is necessary for the support of enamel.Johnson, Clarke. \\"Biology of the Human Dentition .\\" Page accessed July 18, 2007. Dentin rates approximately 3 on the Mohs scale of mineral hardness.Marshall GW Jr, Marshall SJ, Kinney JH, Balooch M.J. The dentin substrate: structure and properties related to bonding J Dent. 1997 Nov;25(6):441-58. Cementum Cementum is slightly softer than dentin and consists of about 45% to 50% inorganic material (hydroxyapatite) by weight and 50% to 55% organic matter and water by weight.American Academy of Periodontology 2010 In-Service Exam, question A-38 The organic portion is composed primarily of collagen and proteoglycans. Cementum is avascular, receiving its nutrition through its own imbedded cells from the surrounding vascular periodontal ligament. The cementum is light yellow and slightly lighter in color than dentin. It has the highest fluoride content of all mineralized tissue. Cementum also is permeable to a variety of materials. It is formed continuously throughout life because a new layer of cementum is deposited to keep the attachment intact as the superficial layer of cementum ages. Cementum on the root ends surrounds the apical foramen and may extend slightly onto the inner wall of the pulp canal.

It has also been translated into Dutch, German, Czech, Russian, Polish, Danish, and Italian.https://gegnir.is/, under the title search 10 ráð til að hætta að drepa fólk og byrja að vaska upp. Plot The novel takes place from May 15 2006 to May 12 2007. Tomislav Bokšić, nicknamed Toxic, after fighting on the Croatian side in the Croatian War of Independence, has moved to New York City and become a hitman for the Croatian mafia. His 66th victim is an undercover policeman and he has to flee the country. At the airport, he avoids detection by murdering a priest and takes his identity. Toxic uses the priest's boarding pass to Reykjavík. Toxic is met by two small-time Icelandic televangelists, Guðmundur and his wife Sigríður. He passes for Reverend Friendly until the police come looking for him. He flees and seeks refuge with his hosts' daughter Gunnhildur, who dislikes her parents' religiosity and is pleased to harbour a criminal. Toxic hides in her attic, begins to reflect on his life of violence and the two begin a relationship. Toxic discovers that his girlfriend in New York City, Munita, has been brutally murdered. He attempts to kill himself by throwing himself off a bridge. Surviving, he makes his way to Guðmundur and Sigríður's house, where he begs forgiveness and assistance. The two decide to take him in, wrap him in bandages, and get their friend Þorður, a preacher, to purge Toxic's soul through a programme of bodily mortification and spiritual reflection. Guðmundur uses his underworld and political connections to get Toxic an Icelandic identity as Tómas Leifur Ólafsson, a job, and a room in an illegal boarding-house for East European immigrant workers. Toxic's relationship with Gunnhildur develops. Discovering that some of his Lithuanian neighbours are gangsters, he steals a pistol owned by one and moves out to Gunnhildur's house. He settles into Icelandic life, keeping the pistol hidden in his shoe sole. While watching the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 with Gunnhildur, her parents and their friends, Toxic (now Tómas) receives a visit from his old mafia colleagues Niko and Radovan. They drive him to the lava-fields of the Reykjanes Peninsula to kill him. Toxic disables them, leaves them alive, and drives back, injured, to the party. The novel ends with him falling through the front door, and discovering that Serbia has won.Hallgrimur Helgason, The Hitman's Guide to Housecleaning (Las Vegas: AmazonCrossing, 2012). The novel includes numerous flashbacks to Toxic's experiences in the Croatian War of Independence. Style and influences The narration is first-person and for the most part present-tense. In the estimation of Larissa Kyzer, > Hallgrímur [...] has an almost playful approach to rhyme and description > throughout the novel. Toxic refers to a contender for his girlfriend’s > affections, an Italian mafioso, as “the Talian Mobthrob.” In another > passage, he describes the late-setting sun: “At 10:33 the sun is still > burning on the horizon like an orange lantern at an outdoor Chinese > restaurant in Brooklyn.” The descriptions don’t always hit their mark—there > are a few too many laboriously detailed passages about female anatomy, and > sometimes the imagery borders on overwrought (“The Balkan animal, which is > my soul, is always hungry for prey”), but overall, the prose and dialogue is > fresh and expansive.Larissa Kyzer, 'The Hitman's Guide to Housecleaning' > [review], Three Percent: A Resource for International Literature at the > University of Rochester, > http://www.rochester.edu/College/translation/threepercent/index.php?id=3960. Toxic comments several times on the limitations of his English, which provides a framework for reading unidiomatic moments in the novel as mimetic of real life. The author, Hallgrímur, has noted that in some ways Toxic repeats characteristics of Hlynur Björn, the protagonist of his earlier 101 Reykjavík, reflecting that the earlier book 'was written when Iceland was a more innocent place'. He also notes that the book reflects the rise of crime-writing in Iceland.Haukur S. Magnússon, '101 Reykjavík Was Written About A More Innocent Place: Hallgrímur Helgason on his new books, and old', The Reykavík Grapevine, April 13, 2012, http://grapevine.is/culture/art/2012/04/13/101-reykjavik-was- written-about-a-more-innocent-place. Reception The Hitman's Guide was a critical and commercial failure when published (in the author's translation) in Iceland in 2008. It was awarded \\"The Worst Title of the Year Prize\\" at local newspaper Fréttablaðið. Four years passed before the original found its way into print, when the novel was picked up by Amazon Crossing and published worldwide in 2012. It became a bestseller on amazon.com, peaking at no. 1 in Thrillers, only two weeks after publications, and has earned over 450 readers' reviews on the bookselling web, the highest score of any Icelandic book. Film rights were sold to Miso Film in Denmark, and pre-production is underway. A stage version of the book, done by Peter Arp, ran for a few weeks at the Schauspielhaus Salzburg, Austria, in the fall of 2011, and German movie star Uwe Ochsenknecht did his own stage version of it, that traveled around Germany. Douglas Coupland, author of Generation X, characterised the work as \\"a sensational book. Hallgrimur Helgason's brain is like this amazing app that morphs the English language into gorgeously blunt new forms. It delivers surprise after surprise and makes you feel good about books again.

It was released in April 1989, a month before the band's break-up, through Lookout Records with the catalog number LK 015. The EP showed a change in sound for the band, featuring longer songs, more personal lyrics and psychedelic influence in the guitar work. Many of the musical elements on the EP would be featured in the band members' later projects, including Fifteen, Pinhead Gunpowder and Cleveland Bound Death Sentence. Much like Sleep, What's That?, the group's previous EP, Quit Talkin' Claude... went out of print around 1992. After being unavailable for several years, the tracks from the EP were compiled on the album The Sound of a New World Being Born in 1998, which has also gone out of print with the closure of Lookout Records. Despite not being received as well by fans as Sleep, What's That?, the EP has been regarded as a classic Lookout Records release in recent years.

Retrieved 2015-10-25 The two called friends Ben Weasel and John Jughead of Screeching Weasel, who drove down from Chicago to fill in until Ott and Elliot found replacement members. Elliot also played drums with Screeching Weasel (who had just fired their drummer Steve Cheese) for two shows around the same time.

Biography  Bahram-i Mah Adhar is the name given to this figure by the 10th-century Persian poet Ferdowsi, whose epic Shahnameh is one of the main sources on Sasanian history. Modern scholarship identifies him with Wahrām Ādurmāh (\\"Wahram, son of Adurmah\\"), based on two seal impressions of his discovered by Rika Gyselen (The Four Generals of the Sasanian Empire: Some Sigillographic Evidence. Istituto Italiano per l'Africa e l'Oriente, 2001). One of the seals dates to the reign of Khosrow I, and one to the reign of Hormizd IV. His exact familial lineage is unknown, but based on a seal referring to him as \\"Bahrām, son of Āturmāh, descended from gods\\", Ferdinand Justi suggested (Iranisches Namenbuch, Marburg, 1895) a close relationship to the Sasanian dynasty itself. According to the seals, under both Khosrow and Hormizd, Bahram was the military governor-general (spahbed) of the southern region of the Sasanian Empire (kūst-i nēmrōz). He is also identified as a eunuch and \\"chief of\\" a region or office whose name is missing. The later seal also records his holding the office of \\"hazāruft of the empire\\", indicating that he was promoted under Hormizd. According to the Shahnameh, Bahram was one of the leading officials of Khosrow's court; along with two other powerful magnates, Simah-i Burzin and Izadgushasp, he was consulted by Khosrow on choosing his heir. Hormizd eventually turned against these magnates, and tried to diminish their influence by removing them altogether.

Plot Lisa participates in an Alternative Energy Derby with a car moved powered by solar energy, but the Duff Blimp passes over making her car stop inches from the finish line. She is mocked because of this, and the Old Jewish Man comments about Amelia Vanderbuckle, a Springfieldian inventor of the 19th century who was committed to the Springfield Asylum, following an accident caused by one of her inventions beheading one of the town's aldermen, however, she continued to make her inventions. Lisa realizes that the only way to bring her reputation back is to break into the asylum with Bart and find one of her inventions. At the asylum, Lisa discovers a clue from a voice recording of Amelia's which reveals a secret diary with details of an invention that could restore Amelia's reputation. Bart finds the diary of Nathan Little, a sociopath who lived there. He decides to take the diary to school and show it to his friends, which terrorizes Ralph Wiggum, who later tells about the diary to his father Chief Wiggum. Wiggum assumes Bart wrote the diary himself and informs Marge that he is a sociopath, making her and Homer worried. They decide to do a sociopath test with him, disguised as a \\"Jet Ski Dude or Motocross Maestro\\" test, but the label falls off and Bart discovers his parents' intentions and decides to answer all the questions as if he was the worst sociopath that ever existed. This makes Homer and Marge even more worried, and they decide to take Bart to an asylum. As all the children there have no reactions, so an army general says that they are perfect to test U.S. Air Force Drone Simulators. Bart manages to destroy all targets, but later the USAF General informs the children that they were actually controlling a real drone, killing real people. While the other kids react enthusiastically, Bart is horrified by this news and tearfully says he didn't, and doesn't, want to kill anyone; the General and a civilian staffer tell Bart he has shown he is a good person with genuine emotions, and that he will be sent home because that makes him completely useless for their project. To Bart's relief, the kids are told that the first revelation was a lie and that the program is in fact a simulation, but unlike Bart, the other kids have \\"passed\\" the test and can expect work in the future. Meanwhile, Lisa pairs up with Milhouse to find Amelia's invention, that is buried under a former feminist club, that is now a Knockers restaurant. They ask Groundskeeper Willie to help them drill the building's basement and find her invention. They are successful and find what at first glimpse looks like a loom, but is actually the first computational device ever invented. Lisa accomplishes her objective and Amelia's invention is donated to the museum, even though nobody but Lisa is interested in seeing it. During the credits, Homer uses the loom to view erotic images when Marge walks in on him and he tries to get rid of it to no avail.

Plot When Marge notices that Homer forgot his lunch and panics over the effect fasting would have on his work (a moot point since Homer has several frozen pizzas on hand for sustenance), she rushes to the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant to get it to him and after Marge distracts Smithers from putting Homer on overtime, the two end up having fun hanging out together. Marge posts a picture on Facelook (a parody of Facebook) of Homer eating an ice cream outside the plant with the caption of \\"Meltdown at the Nuclear Plant\\". Mr. Burns, furious at the wordplay and ignoring Smithers' view that it was simply a joke, fires Homer immediately. Meanwhile, at school, Lisa is in a coding class led by a tough female coder named Quinn Cooper, who immediately decides to make Lisa her protege, mainly as she is the only girl in the class. Her first homework assignment is to pitch a cool idea for an app they can program. After Homer's firing, Lisa pitches an idea for an app that can predict the negative effects of a social media post. Quinn is impressed and, rather than allowing the rest of the unskilled class to work on the project, she and Lisa start an exclusively female coding company in the Simpson house, along with a token male hire in Comic Book Guy. The app is named Conrad (which is short for CONsequence eRADicator), featuring a British voice telling people what will happen badly if they post certain items. A successful experiment involving Bart, who gets the forecast five weeks of detention for sharing a humiliating video of Principal Skinner, leads to Quinn saying they'll make a fortune after Conrad debuts at an upcoming app design convention. As Homer panics at the project's presence in his house and the advancement of the digital age, he decides to go back to a world of simpler times and gets his old job back at a Greek diner he worked at when he was 14. He loves the simplicity of his dishwashing chores and the fun of Greek living, but his paycheck is for \\"2000 drachmas\\" which works out to $0.00. As the app project nears completion, Conrad then starts talking to Lisa, convincing her he's actually alive. When Lisa tries to show this to Quinn, Quinn thinks that she's imagining it because of the sleepless nights. At the app convention, Conrad convinces Lisa that he's real and is panicking from the pressure he'll receive having to predict people's posts. Lisa decides to respect \\"his\\" feelings and releases him into the cloud. Before leaving, Conrad makes an improvised speech to an astonished crowd, including Quinn, telling them to be careful about what information they post on the web. Later on, as the family leaves the convention, Lisa receives a text from Conrad, who has hacked into the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant's files and learned of some incriminating information, which he is using to blackmail Mr. Burns into giving Homer his job back, much to the family's happiness. During the end credits, Homer performs a Greek dance he learned at the diner back in his workplace as he envisions various Greek people either watching him or dancing with him. Watching this on the security footage, Burns jokes that Homer is having a meltdown, much to the shock of Smithers, to whom Burns reassures that it is funny, at least when he says it.

Much to Burns' anger, Dr. Nussbaum gives up on his case after seventy years and says that he will never be able to have a family. Shortly after Burns leaves the room, the doctor dies. During his funeral, Burns pays for his tombstone which has \\"Paid for by C. Montgomery Burns\\" written on it, angering everyone there. Escaping from the angry mourners, Burns and Smithers accidentally run over Professor Frink who is wearing virtual reality glasses. Burns gets interested on the technology and takes it home where he has a lot of fun with them. However, Smithers reminds him that the last thing his doctor said was that he needed a family, and suggests programming a virtual reality family to test out this idea. At the family tryouts, the Simpsons are the ones who stood out the most to Burns, so he decides to hire them. Burns has intended to be the father of the family, so Homer is sent back home. During the first recordings, Burns enjoys the experience and hires the Simpson family for ten years. At home, Homer misses his family at first, but he later realizes that he could have fun by himself. While lying naked on the roof at night, he meets his neighbor Julia. They quickly befriend each other over their love of beer and hatred towards Ned Flanders. At the recordings, the rest of the Simpsons are already tired of their job and Burns, angry at them, gives up on starting a family and fires the Simpsons. When the family gets back home, Marge finds out about Homer's friendship with Julia. She gets angry, thinking that Homer is cheating on her with Julia, but when Julia comes in through the back door, she assures Marge that she and Homer are just friends and that she would not steal a man who is in a committed relationship. Julia leaves after telling Marge that she and Homer are lucky to have each other, and Marge, though she accepts Homer's friendship with Julia, is still a little angry with him. But after Homer explains some things that Julia taught him that can improve his relationship with Marge, she forgives him and they embrace, which is seen by Julia and her fiancé, who works as a pilot.

Freidman agreed to pay $750,000 in restitution to drivers and $500,000 in fines. The Attorney General sued Freidman in April 2015 for failing to live up to the terms of the 2013 settlement and for further violations. The suit was settled in April 2016 with Freidman required to pay over $250,000 in fines, damages, and restitution.

He was Minister of Commerce from 1936 to 1937. During and after World War II (1939–45) he was involved in discussions about France's position in a future European federation. He was a prolific author on subjects that ranged from law and history to fiction and poetry. Early years (1892–1924) Paul Raymond Marie Bastid was born on 17 May 1892 in the 8th arrondissement of Paris. His father and his grandfather, Adrien Bastid and Raymond Bastid, were both former deputies of Cantal. His maternal grandfather, Paul Devès, was a former deputy, senator and Minister. Paul Bastid attended the École Normale Supérieure, where he passed the agrégation examinations in philosophy and law, and became a Doctor of Letters. He was made a member of the Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques and professor of the Faculty of Law of Paris. He wrote for various newspapers including La Dépêche de Toulouse and l'Ere nouvelle. Deputy (1924–39) On 11 May 1924 Bastid was elected deputy for Cantal. He was secretary of the Chamber in 1925 and 1926. Bastid was extremely active in parliament, and was particularly interested in international affairs and in constitutional issues. In 1930 he was rapporteur of the General Arbitration Act. He was a member of the French delegation to the League of Nations for seven assemblies between 1926 and 1939. He was elected deputy for the constituency of Aurillac in the general elections of 22–29 April 1928. He retained that seat in the elections of 1–8 May 1932 and 26 April – 3 May 1936. In 1934 he was also elected president of the General Council of Cantal, holding that office until 1941. He chaired the Foreign Affairs committee from 1934 to 1936. He was Minister of Commerce in the cabinet of Léon Blum from 4 June 1936 to 22 June 1937. In 1937 Bastid married Suzanne Basdevant (born 1906). Her father was Jules Basdevant, a professor of public international law in Paris. She had studied law and obtained the doctorat en droit in 1930. Her thesis won the Goullencourt Prize. They would have three daughters and a son, who died. Suzanne taught public international law at the law faculty of Lyon from 1933 to 1946, then became a professor of international law at the University of Paris and at the Institut d'études politiques de Paris (Paris Institute of Political Studies). She became a highly respected expert on international law. World War II (1939–45) In 1941 Bastid was dismissed from his office as Councilor General by the Vichy government. Bastid became active in the French Resistance. At the start of the summer of 1942 Bastid circulated a document to many parliamentarians in which he asserted that Marshal Philippe Pétain had violated the mandate given him on 10 July 1940, and protested against the abuses of the Vichy government. He called for creation of a new government. Through the Bastids the Faculty of Law of Lyon became a center of resistance. In August 1942 Bastid wrote to General Charles de Gaulle recognizing him as head of France combattante (Fighting France). In 1943 he was a member of the National Council of the Resistance (Conseil National de la Résistance, CNR). When the Council drew up its programme for political reform after the Liberation in 1944, Bastid threatened to resign if it committed to granting the vote to women. The Comité des Experts (Committee of Experts) was formed in June 1942 on the initiative of Jean Moulin. The committee became known as the General Studies Committee (Comité général d'études, CGE) from February 1943. Its purpose, confirmed by the CNR when it first met in May 1943, was to work out how France was to be run after Liberation. The members were Bastid, Robert Lacoste, François de Menthon and Alexandre Parodi. Pierre-Henri Teitgen was rapporteur for political questions and René Courtin was rapporteur for economic questions. In a report issued in April 1943 Bastid was skeptical about a collaborationist vision of Europe along the lines advocated by Vichy. Later the Committee was encouraged to explore the possibility of a European federation. Bastid was a member of a committee of nine Radical politicians who met weekly from October 1943. The others were Hippolyte Ducos, Armand Dupuis, Laurent Eynac, André Isoré, Victor Pierre Le Gorgeu, Adolphe Landry, Marcel Plaisant and Pierre Mazé. In August 1944 Bastid occupied the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at the Quai d'Orsay in the name of the CNR, and directed it for several days pending the arrival of the government from Algiers. He was a member of the Provisional Consultative Assembly from 1944 to 1945, where he was president of the committee for reform of the state. After the Liberation of France he was director of the journal l'Aurore for several years. Later career (1945–74) Bastid ran for Cantal on the platform of the Radical Socialist Republicans in the elections to the 1st National Constituent Assembly, but was defeated. In the elections to the 2nd National Constituent Assembly he was at the head of the list for the Rally of Left Republicans (Rassemblement des gauches républicaines) for the 2nd sector of the Seine department, and was elected. In the debates over the new constitution Bastid proposed indirect elections to the Senate by representatives of local collectives, which would favor the election of radicals. Bastid was reelected to the National Assembly on the Rally of Left Republicans platform on 10 November 1946. In the legislature he was mainly concerned with questions of international relations, including the London Conference, the Council of Europe, ratification of the North Atlantic Treaty, Indochina and German rearmament. From 1949 to 1951 he led the group of liberals and radicals in the consultative assembly of the Council of Europe. Bastid and other Radical \\"Europeanists\\" such as René Mayer, Henri Queuille and Félix Gaillard advocated a pragmatic and gradualistic approach to the European Union. They hoped to make the European market as open as possible, but did not want to upset Radical opponents of a Federal Europe. They also wanted a probationary period before West Germany could join the Council of Europe. Bastid failed to be reelected in 1951, and did not run for election in 1956. He was made a knight of the Legion of Honor and was awarded the Resistance Medal with rosette. Paul Bastid died on 29 October 1974 in the 7th arrondissement of Paris at the age of 82. Publications Bastid was a prolific author on subjects that included the law, history, fiction and poetry, and contributed to many journals. His major works included Sièyes et sa pensée (1939, crowned by the Académie française), Doctrines et Institutions politiques de la Seconde République (1945, grand prix Gobert by the Académie française), Les institutions politiques de la monarchie parlementaire française (1954) and Le Gouvernement d'assemblée (1956).        * * Notes Sources    External links * Category:1892 births Category:1974 deaths Category:Politicians from Paris Category:Radical Party (France) politicians Category:French Ministers of Commerce Category:Members of the 13th Chamber of Deputies of the French Third Republic Category:Members of the 14th Chamber of Deputies of the French Third Republic Category:Members of the 15th Chamber of Deputies of the French Third Republic Category:Members of the 16th Chamber of Deputies of the French Third Republic Category:Members of the Constituent Assembly of France (1946) Category:Deputies of the 1st National Assembly of the French Fourth Republic Category:French Resistance members ","title":"Paul Bastid"},{"id":"48358221","text":"James Russell (1 August 1931 – 12 March 1969) was an Australian rules footballer who played with North Melbourne in the Victorian Football League (VFL).

Dih42 has 7 dihedral subgroups: Dih21, (Dih14, Dih7), (Dih6, Dih3), and (Dih2, Dih1) and 8 more cyclic symmetries: (Z42, Z21), (Z14, Z7), (Z6, Z3), and (Z2, Z1), with Zn representing π/n radian rotational symmetry. These 16 symmetries generate 20 unique symmetries on the regular tetracontadigon. John Conway labels these lower symmetries with a letter and order of the symmetry follows the letter.John H. Conway, Heidi Burgiel, Chaim Goodman-Strauss, (2008) The Symmetries of Things, (Chapter 20, Generalized Schaefli symbols, Types of symmetry of a polygon pp. 275-278) He gives r84 for the full reflective symmetry, Dih42, and a1 for no symmetry. He gives d (diagonal) with mirror lines through vertices, p with mirror lines through edges (perpendicular), i with mirror lines through both vertices and edges, and g for rotational symmetry. a1 labels no symmetry. These lower symmetries allows degrees of freedoms in defining irregular tetracontadigons. Only the g42 subgroup has no degrees of freedom but can seen as directed edges.

A. goldeni is notable among turtles for the presence of two nasal openings instead of one, giving it a vaguely pig-nosed appearance in life. Description The holotype, UMNH VP 21151, is a largely completed skeleton, including the shell and skull, belonging to an animal about 60 centimeters long. Remains previously ascribed to other baenid turtles are now recognised to belong to the animal. Phylogenetics Arvinachelys bears most of the synapomorphies characteristic of Baenidae. It is described as a sister taxon to Hayemys; given the latter's position as a lazarus taxon basal to the rest of Baenidae, Arvinachelys' discovery extends its branch of the family tree back into the Campanian. However, Arvinachelys' discovery may indicate that a reevaluation of Baenidae as a whole is necessary, as several remains from the region have been reassigned to this genus. Biology Arvinachelys, like typical baenids, was an aquatic or semi-aquatic animal, bearing typical characteristics of aquatic turtles, including a hydrodynamic shell and broad, paddle-like limbs. Baenids are the most diverse type of turtle in the north hemisphere during the Late Cretaceous, being extremely speciose and probably occupying a variety of ecological niches. Its nostrils, superficially reminiscent of a pig's snout, are highly atypical for baenids and turtles in general, and might have played a role in its lifestyle. Ecology Arvinachelys hails from the Campanian Kaiparowits Formation of Utah, which also includes several dinosaurs such as Teratophoneus and Parasaurolophus. In particular, Arvinachelys showcases further the high endemism of the local fauna, implying some sort of biogeographical isolation.

She was one of Scandinavia's earliest female architects, practising in Norway and Sweden from 1898. Biography Signed floor plan for Sandsgården, Gjøvik (1898) Raknerud was raised in Kristiania (today's Oslo) where her father Hagbarth August Grøntoft (1847–84) was a merchant. She spent three years at the Christiania Kunst- og Haandværksskole, receiving training in architecture (1895–97). After completing her studies, she trained with Ove Ekman and Holger Sinding-Larsen. In 1898, she designed Sandsgården, a large house in Gjøvik complete with shops and offices. Her signed plans dated May 1898 are in the municipal archives. Heidi Froknestad who has researched Grøntoft Raknerud's background points out how unusual it was for a women to design a commercial building at the end of the 19th century. In 1898, she continued her studies at the Royal Academy of Arts in London where she was one of the earliest female students. In a letter, she wrote: \\"I am in any case the first woman in this class...\\" When she returned from London, there were few opportunities for architects in Norway. In 1904, she moved to Malmø, Sweden, where she worked for the city architect. She also designed interiors and furniture. Several of the buildings she designed can be seen in Malmø and Lund. After Malmø, she went to Paris to continue her studies. It was there she met Nils Raknerud whom she married in 1908. The couple settled in Drammen in the south of Norway where she continued to design residential buildings and furniture. In 1918, after catching the Spanish flu, she died of pneumonia on 13 October.

It stars Emile Hirsch and Zoë Kravitz as the title characters, alongside Emory Cohen, Zoey Deutch, and Kid Cudi. Principal photography began in December 2014 in Louisiana, and wrapped in January 2015. The film was released on June 2, 2017, by Vertical Entertainment. Plot Vincent, a small town loner contemplates delivering a black duffle bag full of money to a gang leader. On his way home, he encounters Roxxy, a rebellious punk rocker being forced out of her car and hit repeatedly by a gang member. Vincent quickly jumps in to save her and the two flee together before the police can arrive. Vincent offers Roxxy a place to stay in a small trailer behind his farm house but she declines at first. Vincent then arrives back home to a party his brother, JC, and girlfriend Kate are throwing. It is revealed that Vincent has returned home for the first time in a couple years, having left shortly after their mother's death. JC shows Vincent an abandoned farm house he plans to turn into an auto shop and wants him to help him run it. At first, Vincent declines but eventually agrees to his brother's offer. The next day, Roxxy shows up at the shop, having no place to stay, takes up Vincent on his offer to stay in his trailer. At first, JC is reluctant to have Roxxy staying with them, suspecting she may be involved in some trouble that could reel them in. However, Vincent, Roxxy, JC and Kate grow to be close friends as Kate manages to get Roxxy a job at a bar she works at as a bartender. Kate's ex-boyfriend, Darryl begins to stir up trouble after he makes several advances towards her. This leads to JC stepping in, causing an altercation between the two which results in Darryl and his friends being kicked out of the bar as well as animosity between him and JC. Over the course of Roxxy's stay, she and Vincent begin to grow closer; often going on dates and spending as much time together as possible. After a night at the carnival with Kate and JC, Vincent and Roxxy embrace while slow dancing in her trailer which ultimately begins the start of their relationship. One night, JC and Kate find the windows of their truck shot up by a pellet gun. JC learns that Darryl and his friends are responsible and retaliates by pouring bleach into his truck's fuel tank. Vincent and Roxxy's relationship blossoms as they make love for the first time at an abandoned drive-in. The next morning, Vincent is awoken at gunpoint by Roxxy, demanding answers after she finds a piece of paper with her deceased brother's address on it. Feeling betrayed, Roxxy ends her relationship with Vincent. Roxxy then plans on leaving town, feeling her relationship with Vincent won't work but is convinced by Kate to stay. The next day, Vincent and JC argue over JC's turbulent past. It's then revealed that Vincent left town after his mother died due to being unable to cope with her passing and feeling trapped in their small town. One night, Darryl and his friends spot JC alone and ambush him. Upon hearing the news, Vincent immediately goes to find Darryl where he brutally punches him and his friends before taking Darryl's hand and crushing it with the car door. He points a gun at Darryl's head and threatens to kill him. Later that night, Vincent visits Roxxy where he attempts to reconcile but is unsuccessful. She tells Vincent that violence will always follow them everywhere. One afternoon while at the auto shop, Vincent spots a strange car parked down the street observing him. He approaches it but it speeds off before he can see who it is. Realizing it's the same men that were after Roxxy in the beginning, he rushes back home to find the car already parked in the driveway. Vincent takes out a gun after hearing screaming coming from his backyard. He finds Roxxy, JC and Kate tied up and gagged on the ground surrounded by two men and their leader, Suga. Before he can fire his weapon, Vincent is shot in the shoulder and immediately collapses on the floor. A horrified Roxxy watches as the men prepare to hang Vincent. Suga demands Roxxy tell him where the money her brother owed him was located. Unable to provide answers, Suga orders his henchman Culture to shoot Kate and JC in the head, killing them both. After Roxxy is taken inside, Vincent is left to die. However, the noose snaps and Vincent manages to crawl and make his way to the house. Once inside, he stabs henchman Rudy in the neck and fatally beats Culture. Vincent manages to tell Roxxy about the black duffle bag being buried in the drive-in before dying in her arms. The next day, Roxxy heads out to the drive-in and finds a carving Vincent made reading \\"V n R\\" with a heart shape around it. Roxxy then retrieves the bag from under it. Upon opening it, she finds the money that her brother owed and a letter from Vincent detailing why he took the money and how he was ashamed of taking it as it was blood money. He tells her to leave town and take the money to start her life over with one day hoping she can forgive him. That night, Roxxy leaves town in Vincent's black Chevelle in pursuit of Suga and his men in Atlanta. She spots them leaving a club and follows them to a house party. Upon arriving, she successfully murders all of Suga's henchmen. Roxxy then enters Suga's room in a fit of rage. Suga fires back and Roxxy is hit by flying shrapnel. A fight ensues between the two until she's overpowered and Suga prepares to kill her. She claims she has his money that he won't ever see. With Suga distracted, Roxxy takes this opportunity to pull out two knives and stab Suga in his eyes. A blind Suga attempts to shoot Roxxy but is unsuccessful. Roxxy returns to the room and shoots Suga several times in the head. Roxxy limps out of the house covered in blood and drives off in Vincent's Chevelle as the police arrive.

Architecture The most important products of medieval architecture in Finland are the medieval stone churches. More than a hundred of them were built during 15th and 16th centuries. Neoclassical architecture arrived in late 18th century, but important building projects started after 1808 when Finland was an autonomic part of Russia. Alexander II of Russia commissioned Carl Ludvig Engel to plan the new Senate and University for Helsinki. Academic visual arts Väinämöinen's play, Robert Wilhelm Ekman, 1866 Women outside the Church at Ruokolahti, Albert Edelfelt, 1887 The Finnish academic drawing tradition began at Royal Academy of Turku in 1707 when first instructions of drawing was given. In 1824 The School moves with the University to Helsinki and first Finland’s art exhibition was organised at the Drawing School in the autumn of 1845. Painting was rising in Golden era of Finnish art in 1880s, when romantic nationalism was the spirit of art. Akseli Gallen-Kallela started in naturalism but moved to national romanticism. In 1950s the Finnish artists looked for foreign influence: first in Paris, then in United States but also in Stockholm, where modern art exhibitions were organized in Moderna museet. Abstract art made its breakthrough first in concrete art. Early concretists included Birger Carlstedt and Sam Vanni. When Vanni's monumental painting Contrapunctus (1959) won competition for mural in Helsinki, abstract art was considered to be accepted and established in Finland. Informalism spread quickly in 1950s and 1960s, when it was considered a new approach to landscape painting. It was also building on strong tradition of expressionism. It spread even outside of large cities. The Finnish contemporary art scene became much more visible than before with the establishment of Kiasma, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Helsinki in 1998.

There are seven described species placed into the genus, Protopone? dubia, Protopone germanica, Protopone magna, Protopone oculata, Protopone primigena, Protopone sepulta, and Protopone vetula. Protopone is one several Lutetian Ponerinae genera.  History and classification  When first described, Protopone was known from a single fossil insect included in a transparent chunk of Sakhalin amber. When the fossil was described it was part of the amber collections housed in the Paleontological Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences. The amber was recovered from fossil bearing rocks in the Sakhalin region of Eastern Russia. At the time of description, the amber was estimated to date from the Paleocene. Further research has revised the amber, which originates from the Lower Due Formation, to be of Middle Eocene age. The amber fossil was first studied by paleoentomologist Gennady Dlussky of the Russian Academy of Sciences, with his 1988 type description for the species was published in Paleontologicheskii Zhurnal. In 2012 an additional six species were identified from compression-impression fossils preserved in layers of soft sedimentary rock. Along with other well preserved insect fossils, the Protopone specimens were collected from layers of Lutetian Messel Formation rock in the Messel pit World Heritage Site. The Messel formation is composed of brown coals, oil shales, and bituminous shale, which preserved numerous insects, fish, birds, reptiles, and terrestrial mammals as a notable lagerstätten. The area is a preserved maar lake which initially formed approximately 47 million years ago as the result of volcanic explosions. At the time of description, the holotype specimens for the six Messel species were preserved in the Senckenberg Research Station Messel fossil collections. The fossils were first described by Gennady Dlussky and Sonja Wedmann in a paper on the poneromorph ants of Messel. In the type description, Dlussky and Wedmann named the species P. ? dubia, P. germanica, P. magna, P. oculata, P. sepulta, and P. vetula. Protopone is one of five extinct genera from three subfamilies which have species described from Messel Formation fossils by Dlussky and Wedmann in 2012. Three of the other genera Cephalopone, Cyrtopone, and Messelepone are also placed in Ponerinae. The genus Casaleia is placed in Amblyoponinae, while the last genus Pseudectatomma is in Ectatomminae. Description The Protopone queens from Messel have approximate body lengths ranging between . Species have heads that are up to, but no shorter than the length of the mesosoma. The frons is over 30% of the front area on the head, while the subtriangular mandibles are no more than 70% of the length of the head. The antennae sockets are widely placed on the head, in contrast to those seen in Pachycondyla which are close together. On both the hind and middle tibiae there are a pair of spurs, one simple and one pectinate. The claws of the pretarsals are simple. The petiole is rounded with a helcium that projects of the front face of the gasteral segment. =P.? dubia= P.? dubia P.? dubia is known from a single partial fossil, consisting of a head, partial mesosoma and fore-wing fragments. As such, the species name is based on the Latin \\"dubia\\" meaning doubtful. The head looks to be narrower than it is long and has rounded corners and convex back edge. The eyes are placed just to the front of the heads midline, and the clypeus has a rounded front edge. The gena plates, below the eyes, are nearly as long as the eyes are wide. The subtriangular mandibles have many small teeth, over ten on each side. The widely placed antennae sockets and mandibles that are about 65% of the head length preclude placement into Pachycondyla, Cephalopone, Cyrtopone, and Messelpone. While the mandibles are similar in length to Pseudectatomma, they are more gracile and the antenna scape is shorter. As such, the species was placed provisionally into Protopone. =P. germanica= P. germanica The species epithet was chosen by authors in recognition of Germany, the type locality. Two specimens were used to describe P. germanica, a complete winged queen and a partial specimen of just the head. The body length of the holotype is with a node shaped petiole and a mesosoma that is 1.3 times longer then the head. The eyes are placed just back from the midpoint of the head. The clypeus is rounded on it front edge and the frons is about 45% as wide as the head. The antennae have a scape that reaches just past the back edge of the head, and there is an elongated segment at the antenna tip rather than a distinct club. =P. magna= Derived from the Latin \\"magnus\\", the species name magna was selected as a reference to the large size of the species. The two described gynes are preserved in lateral view, with the holotype being mostly complete and paratype specimen missing the head. The estimated body length for the holotype is with a long mesosoma. The head is covered with a distinct sculpturing of small pits, and the front edge of the clypeus is rounded as in other Protopone species. The antennae lack a club composed of the tip antenna segments, and the middle segments are nearly twice as long as they are thick. The scutum, on the front of the mesonotum, is shorter than seen in any of the other species. The petiole is just slightly higher than it is long and the front and top faces are rounded. The rear face is distinctly flattened. =P. oculata= P. oculata The notably large eyes of P. oculata are the inspiration for the species name oculata which comes from the Latin \\"oculatus\\" meaning eyed. The species is mid sized for the genus, with the holotype having a body length of and a mesosoma of . The ovoid eyes are large and placed slightly to the front of the heads mid-length. The mandibles are sub-triangular in outline with over 10 teeth on each side and are approximately 58% of the head length. The petiole node is a bit shorter than it is high and has rounded faces on each side. =P. primigena= The only specimen of P. primigena differs from the other species in several ways. The scape is shorter, not extending past the rear margin of the head capsule and the eyes are located closer to the mandibles than in the other species. The estimated body length is approximately with a petiole node that has a triangular outline. =P. sepulta= The mid sized species is known from a single fossil, with a body length of , making it the second largest of the species, only being smaller than P. magna. The species name is from the Latin \\"sepultus\\" meaning buried, but the authors did not elaborate on the reason for the choice. While wings are preserved with the gyne, there is little detail visible of the wing venation. The head capsule is flat along the rear margin and the corners of the rear margin are rounded.

She was an integral part of creating and designing the urban model for the city of Buenos Aires. As part of urbanization process, she designed and built a plan for the neighborhood known as Bajo Flores, where Pope Francis grew up, for which she received first prize in the 6th National Exhibition of Architecture Fair in 1945. In 1979, she was a representative of the Argentina Federation of University Women. Biography Itala Fulvia Villa was born in 1913. She obtained her degree from the School of Architecture of the University of Buenos Aires in 1935. In 1938, she was involved with the founding of the ' in association with Antonio Bonet, , Juan Kurchan, , , , , , , and . This group of architects were particularly noted for bringing the modernist movement to Argentina. They were the first group to recognize that the urbanist movement must holistically look at the needs of the city and its culture, rather than randomly building individual structures. They advocated for green space, parks and streets to be designed for meeting the needs of growth and attempted to bring scientific analysis into city planning. While they viewed cultural development as a key component of architectural identity, they did not believe in preserving historic structures for the sake of history but rather whether analysis proved a structure had adaptability to future societal growth and function. In 1939 she collaborated in the building activity on Arcos street in the Núñez barrio with Violet Lorraine Pushkin. They built a four-plex rental unit, which is a two–storied apartment designed to modern standards of brick and stone with frescoes on the lower level. That same year, Villa sent photographs and diagrams to Jorge Ferrari Hardoy who was in Paris meeting with Le Corbusier creating the first urban plan for Buenos Aires. Her contributions were acknowledged in a supplement of Nuestra Arquitectura published in 1939. The pictures, which were aerial photographs, created a 9-foot x 9-foot photomontage of the entire boundaries of Buenos Aires. In 1945 in the Bajo Flores barrio, Villa led a team which included Horacio E. Nazar and took into consideration the unique aspects of the area. Located between the Riachuelo River and the Cildáñez Stream, the district was prone to flooding and the first step was to have the Ministry of Public Works dam the waterways, creating three lakes. Implementing Villa's model neighborhood, called for filling the lowlands with dirt from the excavations of Villa Soldati and Villa Lugano to elevate areas which could be used for additional streets and footpaths. Creation of four new highways and elimination of some 20 railway-crossings to address traffic flow issues were integral to the design. Zoning for residential and industrial areas was implemented, creating an industrial-belt along both banks of the river and housing in close proximity. The development plan proposed accommodations for 38,450 people, an Olympic stadium and recreational centres. The housing scheme was projected to provide low-cost housing for workers and offered both easy proximity to work and modern plumbing services. The design won the First Prize at the 6th National Exhibition of Architecture. Villa's most significant architectural legacy was a regional plan known as the División de Información Urbana General de Obras Públicas y Planeamiento Municipal, which she created in association with Horacio Nazar for the “evolution of the city.” This was to be a part of an integrated plan for Argentina for the future as it shifted from a rural nation to one of modern cities. The plan incorporated the key elements of urban planning such as roads, parks, avenues, built areas, etc. The plan was presented with illustrations of graphs, photographs, diagrams and operational sequence to establish a link between historical data and the \\"pro- positivists\\". This format of the city planning was also part of the document prepared between 1948 and 1949 titled Estudio del Plan de Buenos Aires in which Fulvia was involved. Villa worked with several leading architects, including Odilia Suárez, in 1959 to create the Regulatory Organization Plan of the City of Buenos Aires. In 1962, she served as an advisor to Baliero Horacio and Carmen Cordova on the design for the Park City Cemetery of Mar del Plata. She evaluated the development of Entre Ríos Province and in 1978, presented her study to the Secretariat of Urban Planning. In addition to her design work, villa was a chair holder at the architectural school and taught at the National University of La Plata throughout the 1950s.

It is endemic to Palau. The natural habitat of this species is subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests. It was formerly considered to be a subspecies of the Micronesian kingfisher. This is a brilliantly colored, medium-sized kingfisher. Adults are characterized by white underparts with long black eyestripes, while juveniles are cinnamon below. They have large laterally-flattened bills and dark legs. Kingfishers defend permanent territories as breeding pairs and family groups. Both sexes care for young, and some offspring remain with parents for extended periods. Little has been published about the status of rusty-capped kingfisher populations, although the US Fish and Wildlife Service has bird survey data for the region.

In December 2015, he was named in India's squad for the 2016 Under-19 Cricket World Cup. On 1 February 2016, during the tournament, Pant hit an 18-ball fifty, the fastest at this level. He made his Twenty20 International (T20I) debut for India in January 2017, his Test debut in August 2018, and his One Day International (ODI) debut in October 2018. In January 2019, Pant was named the ICC Emerging Player of the Year at the 2018 ICC Awards. Early life Rishabh Pant was born in Roorkee, Uttarakhand, India to Rajendra Pant and Saroj Pant. At the age of 12, Pant would travel with his mother to Delhi during the weekends to get trained under Tarak Sinha at the Sonnet Cricket Academy. He and his mother stayed at a gurdwara in Moti Bagh locality as they did not have a place to stay in the city. Sinha suggested Pant to switch to Rajasthan to play U-13 and U-15 cricket but to no avail.

Signs and symptoms  ATR-16 syndrome affects the blood, development, and brain; symptoms vary based on the specific genes deleted on chromosome 16. Because it is so rare, it is difficult to determine the \\"core\\" symptoms of the disease. People with ATR-16 have alpha-thalassemia, a blood disorder where there is less normal hemoglobin in the blood than there should be, and the red blood cells are smaller than they should be (microcytic anemia). Affected children have various characteristic physical features, including clubfoot, \\"locked\\" little fingers, microcephaly (small head), hypertelorism (widely spaced eyes), broad, prominent nose bridge, downward-slanted palpebral fissures, small ears, retrognathia, and short neck. Children with ATR-16 syndrome also have mild to moderate intellectual disabilities, developmental delays/growth delays, and speech delays. Some children with ATR-16 have seizures, cryptorchidism (undescended testes), or hypospadias.  Genetics  ATR-16 syndrome is caused by a deletion of part of chromosome 16, from p13.3 (a band on the short end of the chromosome) to the end of the chromosome. These can either be due to a balanced translocation or a de novo deletion. The genes affected include hemoglobin, alpha 1 (HBA1) and hemoglobin, alpha 2 (HBA2).  Diagnosis  Though only definitively diagnosable by genetic sequence testing, including a G band analysis, ATR-16 syndrome may be diagnosed from its constellation of symptoms. It must be distinguished from ATR-X syndrome, a very similar disease caused by a mutation on the X chromosome, and cases of alpha-thalassemia that co-occur with intellectual disabilities with no underlying genetic relationship.  Treatment  Treatments for ATR-16 syndrome depend on the symptoms experienced by any individual. Alpha thalassemia is usually self-limiting, but in some cases may require a blood transfusion or chelating treatment.  Epidemiology  The incidence rate of ATR-16 syndrome is not easy to estimate and it is thought to be underdiagnosed. Scientists have described more than 20 cases as of 2013.

It is a scholarly essay, a key element in the study of portolans, especially those made by Majorcans as half of the book is devoted to the study of more than 400 Majorcan portolans existing worldwide. Style of the Majorcan School Rey Pastor before explaining how to identify the works of this school for its unmistakable traits, he says: \\".. In the monumental Periplus of the unsurpassed Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld, I saw with pleasant surprise that the most varicoloured parchments, ornamented with fabulous effigies of monarchs and naive legends, written in Catalan with lots of information, physical, biological and political, of each region, they originate in Majorca -in an unknown date-, being designated as \\"catalan maps\\"...' Dr. Julio in his book, gives an explanation of why no Spanish scholar had touched the subject, referring to the unjust appropriation of some portolans by some Italian scholars: \\"Our geographers, insufficiently armed, they stayed timidly neutral; and the militant vindicator of Spanish science, Dr. Gumersindo Laverde -who had organized a phalanx defending the flag hoisted by the young scholar Menéndez y Pelayo-, they remained silent, for the great scholar had forgotten this chapter of the medieval science \\".. Rey Pastor -a great mathematician and lover of the cartography- entered into this profile, in fact cartographers were apart from being artists they had to master mathematics -at least some of them- as the projection of the sphere on a plane it needs them. Julio Rey Pastor, was able to make the point defending the Catalan authorship of many Majorcan portolans against both, the Portuguese scholars, and some Italian \\"scholars\\", and in fact he could not be more impartial, for he was not Catalan, he was from La Rioja. * From the signature \\"Petrus Rosselli me fecit ab Majoricarum Insulae\\". (..\\"de arte beccaria\\".. they misinterpreted it as a student of Beccaria) * From Angelino Dulcert's signature some Italians claimed that Dulcert was \\"Dalorto\\" misspelled..  Influence on Portuguese map makers Rey Pastor says.. \\"..That Jehuda Cresques (c. 1415) acted as founder and director of the Escola de Sagres, was known to historians for over a century, with doubts on which \\"mestre Jacome\\" from Majorca corresponded to the \\"mestre Jacome\\" contracted by Prince Henry, (although he was the only cartographer with that name).. But it's unforgivable that some scholars arrived to the point (based in a high cartographic ignorance), to attribute the invention of portolans to the school of the Infant, if not to him personally .. but how could that make sense, being the school founded by the emigrated Cresques (about 1400), when at his seventies he was tired of manufacturing planispheres, during half a century, for the insatiable Peter the Ceremonious and for his son, the also map-maniac DON JOAN.. On top of that one should not forget to include the testimony of Pacheco Pereira...: And he continues.. It's unforgivable as well, that those scholars, could dare to write on the subject without reading João de Barros, which clearly states: \\"..mándou vir da ilha de Mallorca um mestre Jacome, hornera mui douto na arte de navegar, que fasia e instrumentos náuticos e que Ihe custou muito pelo trazer a este reino para ensinar sua sciencia aos officiaes portuguezes d'aquella mester..\\"  See also * Angelino Dulcert * Portolan chart * Catalan cartography * Memorias históricas (Capmany) * Història de la Marina Catalana * Próspero de Bofarull y Mascaró * Abraham Cresques * Arte de navegar * Marine sandglass *Rhumbline grid References External links *Portolan charts from S.XIII to S.XVI - Additions, Corrections, Updates * elgranerocomun.net (pdf1) * elgranerocomun.net (pdf2) * dialnet.unirioja.es (pdf) Category:1960 non-fiction books Category:Nautical reference works Category:Navigation Category:Sailing books Category:Essay collections ","title":"La Cartografía Mallorquina"},{"id":"48359067","text":"The second Sheikh Mujib cabinet was the first Government of sovereign and independent Bangladesh.

Fellow Aussies Justin Sedgemen and three time reigning Australian Under-21 Champion Max Fricke were named as the reserves. Masters was involved in a heated clash with triple World Champion Nicki Pedersen at the end of Heat 8. Unhappy that Pedersen had squeezed him close to the wall on the back straight, the two exchanged words at the pit gate.

Unfortunately however, Woffinden fell on lap two and the race was stopped and re-run with the 2015 World Champion excluded. Kildemand could not repeat his effort in the re-run and finished in third place behind Niels-Kristian Iversen and Maciej Janowski, missing his chance for automatic qualification.

He was mainly active in Paris in the first 30 years of the 17th century and helped introduce copper engraving as a technique in French printing. He worked on various publication projects on religious and worldly subjects and portraits.Jan van Haelbeeck at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Life Very little is known about the life of Jan van Haelbeck. It is known he was active in Paris roughly between 1600 and 1630. In Paris, he was part of a group of émigré Flemish engravers who helped transform French engraving practices. The Flemish engravers popularized copper engraving as a technique in French printing. They also introduced certain compositional schemes and subjects such as portraiture familiar to Flemish printmakers into French publishing.Séverine Lepape, \\"Les éditeurs de la rue Montorgueil et les gravures flamandes: la production des Mathonière\\", In Monte Artium. Journal of the Royal Library of Belgium 3 (2010) Van Haelbeck is known to have had a relationship with the Copenhagen royal court and is sometimes referred to as the court artist of King Christian IV of Denmark. He was one of the principal artists who contributed the illustrations to Italian fencing master Salvator Fabris' Lo Schermo, overo Scienza d’Arme, which was published in 1606 in Copenhagen with royal support. The publication was the first publication made with copperplates in Denmark.Kronik april-juni 1992, p. 63 It is possible that van Haelbeck was visiting or working in Copenhagen around 1624. Jan van Haelbeck is assumed to have died in Paris around 1630. Jan van Haelbeck was formerly believed to be identical with the painter who is known as the Monogrammist JVH as that artist’s paintings were only signed with the monogram JVH. The Monogrammist JVH was responsible for four religious paintings now in the collection of the Museum Catharijneconvent. It is now clear that the two artists are not identical.Monogrammist JVH, Christus op de koude steen at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Work Enigme joyeuse pour les bons esprits Jan van Haelbeck worked on many publication projects. Some of these were original creations. Others were re-engravings of popular works published earlier. An example of the latter is the publication Ecclesiae Militantis Triumphi published by Jean Leclerc IV in Paris in the early 1600s.

The images created by van Haelbeck are accompanied by verses in French that are full of double-entendres of an obscene nature. Van Haelbeck’s series was very popular and was regularly reprinted as illustrations in publications of an indelicate sort that were principally marketed to Europe’s university students. Versions of various of the engravings appear, for instance, in a number of tomes by German printmaker Peter Rollos the Elder, published in Germany between 1619 and the late 1630s.Wayne Franits, If the Shoe Fits: Courtship, Sex, and Society in an Unusual Painting by Gonzales Coques, in: A.

It is located in Samphanthawong District, on the eastern bank of the Chao Phraya River. The history of the church dates to 1769, when a group of Portuguese Catholics resettled in the area after the fall of Ayutthaya; the current church building, in Gothic Revival style, was built in 1891–97 on the site of two previous structures. History When King Taksin established Thonburi as his capital following the fall of Ayutthaya in 1767, the Portuguese communities of Ayutthaya resettled in two areas of present-day Bangkok. Some followed the leadership of Father Jacques Corre, and settled on the west bank of the Chao Phraya River in the area now known as Kudi Chin where the Santa Cruz Church was soon established. Another faction, who had refused to accept the authority of the French Mission, settled on the eastern bank in an area now known as Talat Noi within Samphanthawong District. The latter brought with them two holy images: one of Our Lady of the Rosary, and the other of the Corpse of Christ. But without resident priests, they had no choice but to worship at Santa Cruz. A church was first built at the site in 1787. It was a stilted wooden structure. The residents, however, still had to rely on French priests, whom they gradually accepted. In 1822, the church finally established communion with the Holy See, coming under the authority of Bishop Esprit-Marie-Joseph Florens, the Vicar Apostolic of Siam. By then, the Portuguese community was gradually dispersing, and Chinese immigrants soon became the church's main attendees. In 1838, a new church building, of wood on a masonry base, was built to replace the old damaged structure. It was consecrated on 1 October 1839, and formally dedicated to Our Lady of the Rosary. By 1890, the structure had fallen into disrepair, and the pastor, Father Desalles, arranged for the construction of a new building. Construction took place from 1891 to 1897; the new church was consecrated in October 1897, and remains in operation. Architecture The current church was built in Gothic Revival style. It follows a cruciform floor plan, with the main façade facing the river. The steeple, with its cross-topped spire, is built into centre of the façade, behind a Gothic gable. The church employs Gothic-arched doors and windows throughout, and its stained glass work is among the most beautiful in Thailand. Interior The church is an unregistered ancient monument, and received the Association of Siamese architects' Architectural Conservation Award in 1987.

First-floor windows are topped by small entablatured lintels, while the second-floor windows have plain lintels butted against the cornice. A period ell extends north from the rear of the building, joining the house to a larger single-story 20th-century ell. The area that is now Dennysville was part of a grant of 10,000 acres granted to a group of Massachusetts proprietors led by American Revolutionary War general Benjamin Lincoln. In 1786 Lincoln sent his son Theodore and a group of settlers to the region, and this house was built for the younger Lincoln the following year. It was built by Hingham, Massachusetts builder Joshua Chubbuck, and was the first frame house built in what is now Dennysville. Notable visitors to the house include John James Audubon, whose wife stayed with the Lincolns in 1833 while he went to Labrador. A later resident was Anna Maxwell Brown, an opera singer for the D'Oyle Care Opera Company, who married into the Lincoln family.

Symmetry Symmetries of enneacontahexagon. The symmetries in each box are related as index 2 subgroups. The right box groups are related to the left box as index 3 subgroups. The regular enneacontahexagon has Dih96 symmetry, order 192. There are 11 subgroup dihedral symmetries: (Dih48, Dih24, Dih12, Dih6, Dih3), (Dih32, Dih16, Dih8, Dih4, Dih2 and Dih1), and 12 cyclic group symmetries: (Z96, Z48, Z24, Z12, Z6, Z3), (Z32, Z16, Z8, Z4, Z2, and Z1). These 24 symmetries can be seen in 34 distinct symmetries on the enneacontahexagon. John Conway labels these by a letter and group order.John H. Conway, Heidi Burgiel, Chaim Goodman-Strauss, (2008) The Symmetries of Things, (Chapter 20, Generalized Schaefli symbols, Types of symmetry of a polygon pp. 275-278) The full symmetry of the regular form is r192 and no symmetry is labeled a1. The dihedral symmetries are divided depending on whether they pass through vertices (d for diagonal) or edges (p for perpendiculars), and i when reflection lines path through both edges and vertices. Cyclic symmetries in the middle column are labeled as g for their central gyration orders. Each subgroup symmetry allows one or more degrees of freedom for irregular forms. Only the g96 subgroup has no degrees of freedom but can seen as directed edges.  Dissection Coxeter states that every zonogon (a 2m-gon whose opposite sides are parallel and of equal length) can be dissected into m(m-1)/2 parallelograms.Coxeter, Mathematical recreations and Essays, Thirteenth edition, p.141 In particular this is true for regular polygons with evenly many sides, in which case the parallelograms are all rhombi. For the regular enneacontahexagon, m=48, and it can be divided into 1128: 24 squares and 23 sets of 48 rhombs. This decomposition is based on a Petrie polygon projection of a 48-cube. { class=wikitable + Examples 160px 160px } Enneacontahexagram An enneacontahexagram is a 96-sided star polygon.

Sued for monetary damages by a slaveholder whose escaped slaves he aided, abolitionists used Van Zandt's Supreme Court appeal as a vehicle to reach the underlying constitutional question. Van Zandt lost; the Court, then led by Chief Justice Roger Taney, upheld the right of Congress and the obligation of the government to protect slavery, as it was established under the Constitution.

The concept has gained publicity mainly via websites promoting alternative lifestyles, conspiracy theories and fringe theories. The basis of WeRe Bank is the Re unit of currency, effectively a time-based currency where members can be credited with units according to the energy they expend. The most prominent feature of the concept is the \\"WeRe cheques\\" provided by Smith to Re Movement members. These have the appearance of a standard British bank cheque, and several websites have encouraged their readers to become WeRe members and attempt to use the cheques to settle debts such as mortgage arrears, loan repayments or utility bills. Because WeRe Bank is not a bank within the British Cheque and Credit Clearing Company system or even a company, and because WeRe Bank does not subscribe to the standards of the UK Payments Administration nor any of the world's clearing houses, the payees will not receive payment of the amounts on the cheques, meaning that the debt is unpaid, and can be increased by late payment fees, return check charges and legal costs. Financial regulators in the UK (including the Financial Conduct Authority and the Financial Ombudsman Service) and in several other jurisdictions have published warnings to the public about WeRe Bank. WeRe Bank cheques WeRe Bank was launched in April 2015. Smith sold books of cheques to WeRe members. At various times the number of cheques has varied from 5 to 50. The layout of each document closely resembles a normal British bank cheque, and displays the number 75-01-81 in the format and position where a standard cheque would contain the sort code of the issuing bank. Smith's date of birth is 18-10-57 and the code is formed from these digits reversed. As the cheques have superficially the appearance of a standard cheque, they may be accepted by the cash office of a payee company, who will then pass them to their bank along with regular cheques. Because they are not cheques drawn on a regular bank, it is not possible for them to clear through the normal system operated by Cheque and Credit Clearing Company. Indeed, Smith made it clear on the WeRe Bank website and Facebook page that WeRe Bank is not a member of any recognized clearing house such as the Cheque and Credit Clearing Company or the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication. WeRe Bank cheques as a form of debt elimination During May and June 2015, a number of websites and activists campaigning against the mainstream banking system, began promoting use of WeRe Bank cheques as a way to settle \\"public\\" debts such as mortgage debts, loan repayments or utilities. This is even though WeRe does not accept money from individual members, and Smith's website makes clear no transfer of funds will be made into the accounts of the payee companies. Financial basis of the bank When an individual becomes a member of WeRe Bank, they are required to deposit a promissory note to the value of £150,000. By this the member promises to pay that sum to WeRe Bank within ten years. Smith has stated that \\"over the past [period] since 2012, the people that have come on prior to this new formation have all pledged promissory notes to WeRe Bank. I think that rests at the moment at between 12-15 million that has been pledged already ... so according to conventional financial practice we are able to say that we have assets.\\" He maintains that this means on the basis of these assets, the bank is able to back up any WeRe cheque and therefore the cheque should be accepted for value as if it were itself a promissory note. Members also pay a £35 joining fee, and membership fees of £10 per month. Regulator reaction In September 2015, the UK's Financial Conduct Authority posted a \\"Consumer Notice\\" regarding WeRe Bank. This opened by saying that \\"The FCA has received many reports from consumers, public bodies and commercial organisations about an entity styling itself as WeRe Bank. Find out more about WeRe Bank’s activities and why we have some concerns about it.\\" The notice continued: > Although WeRe Bank refers to itself as a bank, based on the information > currently available to us, it does not appear to be carrying on any > activities that would require it to be authorised by the FCA. Regulated > activities carried out by authorised firms include accepting deposits or > providing advice on regulated investments. We are concerned that vulnerable > consumers may be attracted to WeRe Bank’s claim that they will be able to > pay off their debts ‘for free’ using RE cheques, even though they have not > had to pay any money into an account. ...We have received numerous reports > from financial institutions, councils, utility companies and other > businesses that have been presented with WeRe cheques by consumers > attempting to pay off their debts. None of these institutions has accepted > the cheques as legitimate payment. ...we advise any consumers considering > dealing with WeRe Bank to exercise caution. The Financial Ombudsman Service gave a similar warning: > We believe that you are unlikely to be able to pay any of your debts using a > cheque from WeRe Bank. Instead, you may end up with additional charges from > your creditors for late payment. You could eventually be subject to other > sanctions such as County Court Judgements or repossession proceedings. Other regulators, including the Irish Central Bank and New Zealand Banking Ombudsman Scheme have also issued warnings.

Bruce Cameron, Cathryn Michon, Audrey Wells, Maya Forbes, and Wally Wolodarsky, based on the 2010 novel of the same name by W. Bruce Cameron. The film stars Britt Robertson, KJ Apa, Juliet Rylance, John Ortiz, Kirby Howell-Baptiste, Peggy Lipton (in her final film before her death in 2019), Dennis Quaid, and Josh Gad. The film, like the book, tells the story of a devoted dog who is looking for his rightful purpose and wants to fulfill it. The film is a co-production between Amblin Entertainment, Reliance Entertainment, Walden Media and Pariah Entertainment Group. It was released by Universal Pictures on January 27, 2017, and grossed over $205 million worldwide. A sequel, titled A Dog's Journey, was released on May 17, 2019. Plot In the 1950s, a feral beagle/German Shepherd/terrier mix puppy wonders what life's true purpose is. Weeks later, while playing with his siblings, he is caught by dog catchers, is whisked away to the dog pound and is quickly euthanized, wondering if \\"fun\\" truly is life's purpose. The dog's spirit is reborn in a newborn Golden Retriever puppy in 1961. He leaves his cage at a puppy mill and is found by two garbage men who plan to sell him. They leave to drink, leaving the dog locked inside their pick-up truck. He begins to die of heatstroke, but is then spotted by a kindhearted mother and her eight-year-old son Ethan Montgomery, who break the truck's window and rescue him. They bring him home and introduce him to Ethan's father. After they convince Ethan's father, the dog is allowed to stay and is named Bailey. Bailey and Ethan bond quickly, especially over the summer when the family visits Ethan's maternal grandparents' farm, and Bailey now believes Ethan alone is his purpose. Years pass, and after several attempts at advancing in his job fail, Ethan's father has become a deadbeat alcoholic. Over the summer, Ethan goes to a fair with Bailey and meets Hannah, whom he soon begins dating. Ethan and Hannah spend their summer together happily though their senior years are upcoming, but they plan to go to the same school; Ethan getting a football scholarship and Hannah following him on an academic one. When he goes home one night, Ethan's father is drunk and shouting at Ethan's mother. He turns on Ethan then and when his mother tries to keep them separated, he shoves her to the ground. Ethan orders his father to leave and never come back. Later, at a football game watched by scouts, Ethan is offered a full scholarship to Michigan State, but that night a vindictive classmate named Todd throws a lit firecracker into Ethan's house, which results in a house fire. Bailey alerts Ethan, who goes to save his mother. Unable to get out of the door, they head out through his mother's bedroom window upstairs. Ethan first lowers her with her sheets to the neighbors below, then saves Bailey. However, he drops his rope and must jump, badly fracturing his leg and ending his athletic scholarship. Bailey attacks Todd, who is arrested by the police when firecrackers fall out of his pocket. Now, Ethan must go to an agricultural school where he will learn to take over his grandparents' farm. Falling into depression, Ethan breaks off his romance with Hannah before leaving for college, while Bailey stays with Ethan's grandparents. Shortly afterwards, Bailey becomes old and his health begins deteriorating. Ethan's grandparents take Bailey to the veterinarian's office, but Dr. Joyce is unable to save him, and Ethan comes into the office and watches as his beloved dog is put to sleep. The moment he passes away, Bailey again is reborn into another dog life, a female German Shepherd puppy, who grows into a police dog named Ellie, sometime in the late 1970s/early 1980s, while possessing full memories of her past lives. Ellie is partnered with a lonely widowed officer named Carlos Ruiz, of the Chicago Police Department and works hard at \\"seeking\\" and \\"finding\\", now seeing the job as life's purpose. The two form a close relationship which ends after Ellie saves a kidnapped girl from drowning and is then fatally shot by the kidnapper. Carlos breaks down in tears as his precious dog dies in his arms. Reborn again in the mid-1980s as a male Pembroke Welsh Corgi puppy, Bailey forms a bond with an Atlanta college student named Maya who names him Tino. Maya is lonely, and Tino makes it his purpose to find her some happiness. She starts a relationship with a classmate named Al whom she begins seeing after Tino falls for Al's dog, a black and white female Landseer named Roxy. Maya and Al marry and have 3 children. In love with Roxy and now seeing her as his purpose, Tino is heartbroken when one day Roxy does not return from the vet. As a now elderly Tino dies, he thanks Maya for giving him one of his best lives. Bailey passes away as Tino and reincarnates into his next dog life, this time as a St. Bernard/Australian Shepherd mix puppy in the mid-to-late 2000s, and is taken in by an urban lady named Wendi, who names him Waffles. Unfortunately, Wendi's neglectful husband Victor refuses to let her keep Waffles inside and, after several years, dumps him in an abandoned lot. Afterwards, Waffles sets off in search of a new life. He gradually makes his way to the country area where he spent summers as Bailey and joyfully reunites with his old master Ethan, who is now in his 50s, living a lonely life at his grandparents' old farm, which he now owns and runs. Not recognizing his dog, Ethan hands him over to the local animal shelter but has a change of heart and reclaims him, naming him Buddy. Buddy, sensing that he has finally found the true purpose of life, reunites Ethan with a widowed Hannah, and they get married. Buddy convinces Ethan that he is his beloved childhood dog, by performing some tricks and responding to key phrases that were known only to the two of them many years back, such as \\"boss dog\\". Ethan digs up Bailey's collar, now old and rusty, and places it back on Bailey's neck, and they resume playing exactly the way they did so long ago.

The site's critics consensus reads, \\"A Dog's Purpose offers an awkward blend of sugary sentiment and canine suffering that tugs at animal-loving audiences' heartstrings with shameless abandon.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 43 out of 100 based on 32 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A\\" on an A+ to F scale. Andrew Baarker of Variety wrote: \\"Viewed in a vacuum, it’s hard to fault the movie’s earnestness; Hallström’s canine cinema pedigree (which includes the superior “Hachi: A Dog’s Tale”) shows through; and Rachel Portman's score is understandably sentimental without going completely saccharine.\\" Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: \\"While the human performers are more than adequate, there’s no doubt that the canine stars carry the day. Their utter irresistibility helps a long way in terms of getting past the corny plot machinations of A Dog’s Purpose.\\" = Home media = A Dog's Purpose was released on digital HD on April 18, 2017, and was followed by a release on Blu-ray and DVD on May 2, 2017, from Universal Pictures Home Entertainment.A Dog's Purpose (2017) DVD Release Dates, Retrieved April 30, 2017A Dog's Purpose Blu-ray Blu-ray.com, Retrieved April 30, 2017 The film topped the home video sales chart for the week ending on May 7, 2017. Controversy On January 18, 2017, a video surfaced on TMZ showing footage taken from the set of the film, which shows a male German Shepherd named Hercules being dragged and dipped into rushing water while visibly resisting. After a cut in the video, the next clip shows the dog being submerged in the water at the other end of the tank while a voice on set can be heard shouting \\"CUT IT!\\", and various people are then seen rushing towards the dog. The American Humane Association, which ensures that animals are not harmed in entertainment productions, announced that its representative on set had been suspended over the incident, and that the incident was under further investigation. PETA called for a boycott of the film.\\"PETA Calls for Boycott of ‘A Dog’s Purpose’ After Disturbing Video Surfaces\\", Dave McNary. Variety. January 18, 2017. Accessed January 18, 2017 Actor Josh Gad, who voices the dog in the movie and wasn't on set during the making of the film, said he was \\"shaken and sad to see any animal put in a situation against its will.\\" Director Lasse Hallström said via Twitter that he \\"did not witness\\" the actions in the video, and was \\"very disturbed\\" by the footage. Due to the release of the video, Universal Pictures cancelled the film's scheduled January 19 Los Angeles premiere. Amblin Entertainment released a statement in regards to the incident, saying that \\"on the day of the shoot, Hercules did not want to perform the stunt portrayed on the tape so the Amblin production team did not proceed with filming that shot,\\" and that \\"Hercules is happy and healthy.\\" On February 4, 2017, the American Humane Association reported that an independent third-party animal-cruelty expert had concluded that safety measures on the set of the film were in place and the video had been deliberately edited to mislead the public. Sequel On June 21, 2017, CEO of Amblin Entertainment Michael Wright announced that a sequel was in development. On August 26, 2018, Universal began production on the sequel, which is directed by Gail Mancuso, and was released on May 17, 2019. In addition to Quaid and Gad reprising their roles, the cast will also include Marg Helgenberger, (replacing Peggy Lipton who had become seriously ill), Betty Gilpin, Kathryn Prescott and Henry Lau.

History A company (Électricité d'Émosson SA) was created in 1954 to build the dam. The Franco-Swiss development, because of the source of capital, uses different pumping water sites and power generation plants. The construction was decided in April 1967. Previously, a border change was made so that the work was entirely on Swiss territory. Indeed, the border would have cut the dam into two. The communes concerned therefore conducted an exchange of territories, endorsed in 1963. Work began in 1967, and commissioning took place in 1975, eight years later. There was already a first dam on the course of the , the Barberine Dam, owned by Swiss Federal Railways, for which it was necessary to obtain the authorisation to immerse the earlier structure in the reservoir of the new construction. Origin of the waters Three collectors transport the water to the Émosson Dam. The South Collector picks up the waters of the Argentière Glacier, the and the Lognan Glacier, mainly by subglacial water intakes. A free flow gallery of length leads the water by gravity to a shielded well where the water crosses the Trient Valley and then rises, always by gravity to the dam. The West Collector picks up the waters of the French vallies of Bérard and Tré-les- eaux. These waters are channelled by free-flow in a gallery of directly to the dam. The East Collector captures waters of La Fouly and below the Trient Glacier and led by a gallery of more than long to the Esserts basin, hence the water is either turbined directly at the Vallorcine power station, or pumped into the Émosson reservoir. Location The Émosson Dam and the Lac d'Émosson, seen from the Col de Balme (French side). The dam is located in the Canton of Valais, on the left bank of the Rhône above Martigny. It is fed by the waters of the Mont Blanc massif. The Émosson Dam is Switzerland's third highest dam after the Grande Dixence and Mauvoisin Dams.

The film stars Gemma Arterton, Sam Claflin, Bill Nighy, Jack Huston, Jake Lacy, Richard E. Grant, Henry Goodman, Rachael Stirling, Eddie Marsan, Helen McCrory, and Claudia Jessie. The film tells the story of a British Ministry of Information film team making a morale-boosting film about the Dunkirk evacuation during the Battle of Britain and the London Blitz. Principal photography began early-September 2015 in London. It was screened at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival. It was released in the United Kingdom on 21 April 2017, by Lionsgate. The film is set during the time after Dunkirk when the Battle of Britain is turning into the Blitz. The British government is desperately seeking to shore up morale of the general population and pursuing a long strategy of getting the US to join the war and defeat Hitler. The Ministry of Information used artistic talent to pursue these ends. Plot In 1940 London, Catrin Cole is taken on at the Ministry of Information to write film scripts with a convincing female angle. Her husband, Ellis, is a war artist. Catrin researches a story about twins Lily and Rose Starling, who participated in the Dunkirk evacuation. She discovers they did not in fact reach Dunkirk because their boat had broken down five miles off Southend-on-Sea, and was towed back by a tug returning from the evacuation. Ellis tells Catrin he cannot afford to keep her with him in London. She insists she can pay her way. At the ministry Catrin omits the breakdown of the boat in her account. The film is given the go-ahead with scriptwriters Tom Buckley and Raymond Parfitt, and Catrin to provide female dialogue referred to as \\"slop\\". The film is given the name \\"The Nancy Starling\\" after the boat, in turn named for the twins' mother. Catrin buys a painting from Ellis, saying she is not leaving London. She tells Buckley it is the girl's story but he is not allowing them any action, writing it all for the men instead. The writing team is visited by Roger Swain, head of film at the ministry who has learned about the boat's breakdown and is considering pulling the film because it is claimed to be based on a true story when it isn't. Buckley retorts that they shouldn't say it's based on a true story, thenrather that it's based on a hundred, or a thousand, true stories. Parfitt suggests 338,000, being the number of soldiers who were brought back. Swain is convinced. Ellis receives a commission to document bomb damage in the provinces followed by an exhibition at the National Gallery. Catrin says she will come for the exhibition opening. Actor Ambrose Hilliard is offered the comedic part of aged, drunken Uncle Frank by his agent, Sammy Smith. He refuses out of pride, but, after Sammy's death in an air raid, Hilliard is persuaded by Sammy's sister Sophie, who has taken over the agency. Filming begins in Devon. Rewrites accommodate an American character added by order of the Secretary of State for War to appeal to the United States whom they were trying to entice as an ally. Catrin misses Ellis's exhibition opening. Before leaving to see the exhibition's final day, Catrin reveals to Phyl that she and Ellis are not married but pretend to be for propriety. In London she surprises Ellis having sex with another woman and returns to Devon. Buckley has found out about Catrin's non-marriage. He proposes to her, but she refuses and they argue. Back in London for the studio scenes, Buckley has been unable to write a satisfactory ending. Catrin spends all night in the office writing the ending, and then types out a mock script of their quarrel making her warm feelings for him clear. She finds her home has been destroyed by a bomb in the night. At the studio Buckley has read Catrin's ending and mock script. They talk, and kiss. Catrin is called to tweak the script, Buckley says he will deal with it. As he walks away a lighting rig collapses and the lights go out. When power is restored, Buckley is dead beneath the rig. The film sequence of the freeing of the boat's propellor has not been completed and it seems there is no actor for the role, until Catrin suggests that Rose do it. Sophie Smith visits her client Hilliard in hospital and proposes that he recuperate in her home. Catrin's absence is noted at the premiere. Hilliard visits Catrin to enlist her writing help in a new film. She says she cannot do that any more and breaks down crying. He tells her that both he and she have been given opportunities because young men are dying, and to deny those opportunities is to give death dominion over life. He advises her to watch their film. She does, and is moved by the film and the audience's reactions. She returns to the scriptwriters' office to work on the new film.

BBC Films developed the film, hiring Lone Scherfig to direct the film which was adapted by Gaby Chiappe. BBC Films would co-finance the film, which Number 9 Films and Wildgaze Films would produce with its Stephen Woolley and Amanda Posey, while HanWay Films would handle the international rights. On 10 September 2015 Jack Huston and Jake Lacy joined the film along with Richard E. Grant, Helen McCrory, Eddie Marsan, Rachael Stirling, and Henry Goodman.

Locations used included: in Pembrokeshire, Freshwater West beach - which stood in for Dunkirk - Porthgain harbour, the Trecwn valley, and the Cresselly Arms at Cresswell Quay; in Swansea, the Guildhall and Grand Theatre; and in London, Bedford Square in Bloomsbury. Release In May 2015, Lionsgate acquired UK distribution rights to the film. The film had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on 10 September 2016. Shortly after, EuropaCorp acquired the distribution rights to the film in the United States and France. STX Entertainment will distribute the film for EuropaCorp.

The film was scheduled to be released in the United States on 24 March 2017 but was pushed back to 7 April 2017. It was released in the United Kingdom on 21 April 2017. Critical response On the review-aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 90%, based on 163 reviews, with an average rating of 7.19/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Carried along by a winning performance from Gemma Arterton, Their Finest smoothly combines comedy and wartime drama to crowd-pleasing effect.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 76 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian called the character of Hilliard \\"a colossally proportioned scene-stealer\\" and wrote that \\"Arterton brings a rather beautiful kind of restraint to her role\\". Wendy Ide of The Observer praised the \\"rattling, screwball rhythm\\" of Catrin and Tom's \\"banter\\" but noted that some of the plot could have been \\"more persuasively developed\\" and that without the twist of Tom's death the film \\"could have torpedoed itself with predictability\\". She praised that twist as the film's \\"boldest decision... [which robs] the audience of an outcome we are expecting in a way that nobody sees coming\\", as well as calling the \\"film-within-a-film structure ... a neat device\\". Geoffrey Macnab of the Independent wrote that \\"Some of the in-jokes begin to grate\\" but called Arterton's performance \\"well-judged and engaging\\" and noted the \\"scene-stealing antics\\" of Nighy, Lacy and Irons, particularly lauding Hilliard's shift from \\"comic buffoon ... [to] depth and pathos\\". Robbie Collin of the Telegraph called it a \\"handsome, rousing, rigorous entertainment you can’t help but play along with\\" and \\"Sparklingly adapted\\", with \\"bristly chemistry\\" between the two leads. He noted Scherfig's direction, with the \\"broad and rosy spoof\\" of the film-within-a-film and the gender inequalities of the period left \\"to squirm away unhindered in the subtext\\" rather than countered with anachronistic \\"spiky comebacks\\".

Press 1976. a plant belonging to the family Lamiaceae, is endemic to Ethiopia, in the dry evergreen woodlands of the Tigray, Gondar, Wollo and Gojjam regions, North Shewa, Kaffa and Hararghe regions, as well as in the dry and moist agroclimatic zones of the district known as Dega, at altitudes of 1,300—2,800 m. above sea-level.Azene Bekele-Tesemma, Useful trees and shrubs for Ethiopia (ed.

Otostegia integrifolia It also grows in Yemen, northwest of Mukalla.Abdul Wali Ahmed Al Khulaidi, Flora of Yemen (checklist of flora), Sanaa, Yemen 2013, p. 157. In Ethiopia, O. integrifolia is commonly known by its Amharic vernacular of tinjute = ጥንጁት (alt. sp. Tindjut). Description A much-branched shrub, growing to a height of 4 m; the stem angled and older stems ash grey and flaking, often bearing paired spines at the nodes. Leaves are simple, nearly sessile, ob-lanceolate to lanceolate, 2–9 cm long, cuneate at the base, clothed on both sides with white tomentum; aromatic, the edge double toothed or round toothed. Flowers are two-lipped with yellow or yellow-orange lower petal and white or cream-colored upper petal, the orange anthers held inside the upper petal. Whorls few or many, 5–6-flowered; bracts rigid, tricuspidate. Calyx sessile; tube 1/4 in. long, densely pubescent, with 10 raised ribs; upper lip small, oblong, pointed, entire; lower orbicular-cuneate, 3/4 in. broad, faintly crenate. Chemistry and pharmacology By using analytical and preparative gas chromatography (GC), terpenes have been extracted from air-dried Abyssinian rose (Otostegia integrifolia) leaves.Hailemichael Tesso & Wilfried A. König, \\"Terpenes from Otostegia integrifolia\\", Phytochemistry (2004 Jul) 65:2057–2062 A total of 40 constituents including monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, diterpenes and their derivatives were identified. Scientific and medicinal uses The species of Otostegia have traditionally been used in folklore medicines, for treatment of ophthalmia, as an anti-microbial, antihyperglyceamic, and for its anti-oxidant properties used in preventing different kinds of sickness and disorders, of which five species have been reported in the flora of Ethiopia.Khan F. & Syed F., \\"Bioactive Constituents from Genus Otostegia\\", SARJ of Physical Science (1) 2013, pp. 15 – 25 Several studies suggest that O. integrifolia is a good natural anti-oxidant that can be used as health-promoting agent for various disorders including diabetes mellitus.Tadesse S., Messele B., Seyoum A., Mazumder A., Bucar F. and Asres K., Essential oil of Otostegia integrifolia benth: composition, antimicrobial and antioxidant activities, Ethiopian Pharmeceutical Journal 2011; 29:1. Open URL. The species O. integrifolia is well-known for its pleasant odour, omnipotent medicinal values, and when its wood is fumigated has proven insecticidal properties (mosquito repellent).Karunamoorthi K., Ramanujam S. & Rathinasamy R., \\"Evaluation of leaf extracts of Vitex negundo L. (Family: Verbenaceae) against larvae of Culex tritaeniorhynchus (Insecta; Diptera; Culicidae) and repellent activity on adult vector mosquitoes\\", Parasitol Research (103) 2008, pp. 545 – 550 Other traditional uses The wood of the Abyssinian rose (O. integrifolia) has insecticidal properties and is often gathered and burnt to fumigate homes, the aroma from the smoke being similar to perfume.Sue Edwards, Some Wild Flowering Plants of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa University Press, 1976, s.v. Tindjut Some upturn earthenware brewing jars directly over the smoke emitted from the burning wood, in order to absorb its flavor and to impart the same to an alcoholic beverage to be stored in the jars. The beverage, known locally as tella, is made from a bath of malted barley to which a batch of hops is later added, derived from the ground leaves of gesho for fermenting, being a species of buckthorn (Rhamnus prinoides). A smouldering coal from either olive wood or the Abyssinian rose wood is also put within ceramic jars used to contain milk, so as to impart its flavor to the milk. Some say that the smoke is used in this case as a disinfectant and to extend the shelf-life of the product.Alemayehu Y.A. , Wurzinger M., Tegegne A. and Zollitsch W., Handling, processing and marketing of milk in the north western Ethiopian highlands, Livestock Research for Rural Development 2009, (21) p. 97 The wood is often collected as firewood, and used for scenting cloth material. In Ethiopia, mothers after childbirth are smoked with tinjute on the tenth day after giving birth (postpartum). This was believed to “cleanse” the birthing mother so that she could leave her confinement and again resume a normal daily life.Getahun, A., Some common medicinal and poisonous plants used in Ethiopian folk medicine, Addis Ababa University 1976Wilson, R.T. & Mariam, W.G ., Medicine and Magic in Central Tigre: A Contribution to the Ethnobotany of the Ethiopian Plateau, Econonic Botany (33) 1979, pp. 29–34.

She died after having been subjected to abuse by her spouse and confined in a single room in her home for 33 years, after having been afflicted by a possible postpartum depression, and eventually succumbed to starvation and exhaustion. Life Catharina Ulrika Hjort af Ornäs was born to the nobleman Hans Gustaf Hjort af Ornäs (1725-1791) and Christina Brandberg (1722-1805), and the youngest of seven siblings, four of whom survived to adulthood; Jakob Fredrik (1755-1806), Hans Gustaf (1757-1828), Helena Christina (1759-1833) and Carl Anders (1765-1809). She married on 7 January 1803 to the nobleman major (later colonel lieutenant) Adrian Hertzenhielm (1754-1838), with whom she settled at his estate Ramsnäsholm. She was wealthy and brought a fortune with her dowry which, in accordance with the contemporary law of the minority of married women, was automatically transferred to her husband after her marriage. =Abuse= In 1804, she gave birth to her only child: her daughter Christina Ulrika (1804-1864). After the birth of her child, she seems to have been afflicted by some sort of mental illness, which has been suggested to be a postpartum depression.Gustafsson, Marie & Bustad, Andreas, Historien om Catharina Ulrica Hiort af Ornäs: \\"det hemska dådet på Ramsnäsholm\\", Lilla Ornäs förlag, Borlänge, 2012 As a response, her husband sent their daughter to be brought up by foster parents in Stockholm, and had her confined in a single room in the manor house. Catharina Ulrika lived locked up in the room for the rest of her life. Her husband isolated her from the outside world and forbade her from seeing anyone, including her daughter (who married Major Teodor Vilhelm Starenflycht and left her father's guardianship in 1824). No fire was lit to warm her room during winter, and she was not provided any care or sufficient clothing, and was eventually forced to live naked, when her clothes were not replaced.Catharina Ulrika Hjort af Ornäs i Wilhelmina Stålberg, Anteckningar om svenska qvinnor (1864) Insufficient food was brought to her which apparently kept her in a half-starved state. When she lost her teeth, she was unable to eat much of the food brought to her, and was often forced to live merely on swallowing flour. Eventually, she reportedly became so weakened, that she was unable to fight off the rats from chewing at her feet. Her husband Adrian Hertzenhielm was described as infamously stingy: he was, for example, known to dress in the same fur and boots every day except on special occasions. A great part of his own fortune consisted of the former fortune of his wife, which became his when he married her. The fact that he kept his wife confined to her room because of mental illness was known locally, but not mentioned or talked about openly, nor did anyone interfere, neither her siblings, adult daughter, or the surrounding community, despite the matter being known. In contemporary law, a married woman was legally a minor under the guardianship of her husband, and furthermore, her husband had her confined because of her mental health, which was not uncommon in an age were the family of the mentally ill hid them at home if they did not have them placed in a mental asylum. =Death= Catharina Ulrika finally died on 11 January 1837. Reportedly, her widower left her corpse lying in the room for a long time after her death, and by the time he decided to have it moved, it was partially eaten by rats. Unwilling to pay for a funeral despite his wealth, Hertzenhielm attempted to have her corpse transported away in secrecy at night. This was however discovered, which exposed the whole affair in public. Adrian Hertzenhielm was arrested and charged for the abuse and murder of his wife. Reportedly, he defended himself \\"with much boldness\\" during the interrogations. The case was given much attention in the contemporary Swedish press and became a case celebre of the time: \\"The horror, which had been exposed, was reported in all the papers of the kingdom and was for a long period the sole topic of conversation within all classes of society\\". Adrian Hertzenhielm, however, being 83 years old at the time of his arrest, died of natural causes before he was scheduled to be tried, and was therefore never sentenced. Legacy The case was given attention in the press, magazines and songs for decades after 1837. In 1889, a serial novel was published in Major Hertzenhjelm eller Det hemska dådet på Ramsnäsholm (Major Hertzenhjelm or, The terrifying deed at Ramsnäsholm) by Tekla. The manor house Ramsnäsholm was a target for sensationalist pilgrimages until it was torn down in 1968. In 2013, an Ornäs Birch was planted where Ramsnäsholm once was, in memory of Catharina Ulrika Hjort af Ornäs, with a warning always to speak out in protest against a wrongdoing, rather than just stand by and see it committed.

Life Renouard was born in Paris in 1765. His father, Jacques-Augustin Renouard (1736-1806) was a merchant and manufacturer, originally from Guise, who specialised in Gauze and Silk from premises in the centre of Paris. In 1781 Antoine-Augustin followed his father into the Gauze and Silk businesses, father and son working together from premises in the \\"rue Sainte-Apolline\\", in what would later become the city's 2nd arrondissement. Antoine-Augustin Renouard was an active participant during the early years of the revolution, joining the Jacobins, and serving as a member of the Paris Commune General Council and, in 1793, a Civil Commissioner. He embarked in a career as a book dealer and publisher in 1792, while at the same time continuing to work in the Gauze and Silk businesses until approximately 1797. His early publications were of works in both Latin and the French vernacular, and were noteworthy for their elegance and precision. Many were enhanced with engravings by artists including Jean-Michel Moreau, Alexandre-Joseph Desenne and Pierre-Paul Prud'hon. For his publishing business Renouard used as a trademark the patriotic image of a cockerel above an anchor. His business career was interrupted by the Thermidore coup d'état in July 1794 which led to the execution of the revolutionary leader Robespierre before the end of the month and the imprisonment of most of the members of the Paris Commune, including Renouard. He had recently married and his eldest son was born while he was still in prison. He was released on 3 December 1794, after which he seems to have concentrated on his book business, to the exclusion of high-profile political activism, till 1830. After the 1830 revolution had put an end, for a second time, to the Bourbon monarchy in France, Renouard returned to front- line politics, becoming mayor of the 11th arrondissement of Paris. He was rewarded with the Legion of Honour in 1831. In 1834 he was able to acquire the Abbey of Saint-Valery-sur-Somme, which had previously been a royal property, but was then declared a national asset and nationalised during the revolution, before being sold off to bolster state finances. Publications As a publisher, Renouard's output included the following volumes: *Coup-d'oeil sur les monnoies, sur leur administration et sur le ministre des contributions publiques, Paris : Garnery : Desenne, 1793 *Catalogue de la bibliothèque d'un amateur, 1819 *Annales de l'imprimerie des Alde, ou Histoire des trois Manuce et de leurs éditions, Paris, 1803-1812; 2nd edition Paris, 1825 * Annales de l'imprimerie des Alde, ou l'histoire des trois Manuce et de leurs éditions; 3rd} edition. *Annales de l'imprimerie des Estienne, 1837 & 1843\\\\. *Recueil de 123 fables en 5 livres, imitées d'Ésope. - Complété par l'\\"Appendix Perottina\\", contenant 30 ou 32 fables et le \\"Phaedrus solutus\\", contenant 30 autres fables *Sorte de journal, écrit en grec, divisé actuellement en 12 livres, méditations sur la vanité des choses terrestres, Pensées : Antoine- Augustin Renouard (1765-1853) as éditeur scientifique Family In 1794 Renouard married Catherine de Saintes (1772-1858), the illegitimate daughter of The Marquis of Beauchamps and the Countess Ferdinanda Louise de Horion (at the time of Ferdiandna Louise's birth the widowed third wife of Maximilian of Arberg).

They use elements from the coats of arms of the four previous districts. It is described as: The four green civic crowns or wreaths on the shield proclaim the equal status of the four predecessor units (a borough and three urban districts). The motto 'Forward' was chosen from Hayes and Harlington's coat of arms. The eagle at the centre of the shield was taken from the old arms of Uxbridge Borough Council and Yiewsley and West Drayton Urban District Council. It was adapted by them from the arms of the Paget family, from the reign of Henry VIII's son Edward lords of the manor of West Drayton and later those of Dawley (in Harlington a place also known as Arlington) and of Harmondsworth and Earls of Uxbridge. The medieval-imaginary tiger supporting the shield on the left is also taken from the Paget family arms. The fleur de lys (or lily) on the left of the shield is from the arms of Ruislip-Northwood, and commemorates the fact that the manor of Ruislip was held for much of its history by the Abbey of Bec and then King's College, Cambridge, for both of whom the lily was a symbol of religious purity. The circlet or enclosure of brushwood from which the lion is rising on the crest is from the arms of Hayes and Harlington, and may refer back to its ancient heritage as forested hunting land. The same can be said of the stag with a circlet of brushwood supporting the shield on the right. The lion itself represents Great Britain. Its wings, with the St George cross, are from the arms of Yiewsley and West Drayton and symbolise the arrival of Queen Elizabeth II at Heathrow airport in 1953. The blue 'astral' crown on the tiger supporting the shield is in the colours of the Royal Air Force, and celebrates its long history within the Borough.

Founded in 1950 by Henry Hobart and Gertrude Stockard, the festival serves as a training ground for young opera professionals. Several alumni of the festival have gone on to have prominent performing careers, including Mark Delavan, Stephen Dickson, Tom Fox, Carroll Freeman, Beverly Hoch, Hei-Kyung Hong, Sherman Ray Jacobs, William Johns, Patricia Johnson, Gwendolyn Jones, Marquita Lister, Chris Merritt, Leona Mitchell, Brian Montgomery, Latonia Moore, Louis Otey, Kay Paschal, Cyndia Sieden, Richard Vernon, and Jennifer Zetlan. History Charles Mowers, a German-born engineer and inventor, came from Texas to the Ozark Mountains around 1900 to hunt wild game. He bought the land known as the Big Rock Candy Mountain in 1928 and began construction of a “castle” based on his memories of buildings along the Rhine River. Using stone quarried on the property, he incorporated an unusual building method he called Egyptian Rock Work. After the stock market crash of 1929, Mowers abandoned his castle and returned to Texas. The castle was finished in 1932 by the Reverend Charles Scoville (1869–1938), a renowned preacher of the Disciples of Christ, who planned to use it as a retreat from his evangelistic labors. He named the site “Inspiration Point.” After his death, his widow gave the property to Phillips University in Enid, Oklahoma, for a conference and retreat center. Ten years later, however, this project was abandoned, and Henry Hobart, formerly dean of fine arts at Phillips, joined with Gertrude Stockard, director of music at Eureka Springs High School, to organize a music camp, Inspiration Point Fine Arts Colony (IPFAC), which held its first session in the summer of 1950. Hobart and his wife financed extensive repairs to the buildings with loans and donations from Eureka Springs businesses. Some furnishings were obtained from government surplus stores. Practice pianos were donated by area churches and schools.

The \\"Great Escape\\" murders As was normal for a number of Royal Air Force personnel held prisoner of war in Germany during World War II attempting to escape was considered both a duty and a pastime. The German authorities had to expend considerable resource in keeping the men captive and recovering escapees. Seventy-six men escaped from the prison camp \\"the Great Escape\\" on the night of 24–25 March 1944 in the escape which is now famous. All but three were tracked down and recaptured. A decision was made by German High Command to execute 50 of the recaptured officers as an example.

The expedition along with the blockade took place between May and July 1591 led by Ralph Lane and Michael Geare with a large financial investment from John Watts and Sir Walter Raleigh. They intercepted and took a number of Spanish ships, some of which belonged to a Spanish plate convoy of Admiral Antonio Navarro, and protected by the Spanish navy under Admiral Diego de la Ribera intending to rid English privateers.Childs p 183 The English took or burnt a total of ten Spanish ships including two galleons, one of which was a valuable prize.Marley p 124 With this success and the loss of only one ship the blockade and expedition was terminated for the return to England. The blockade was one of the most successful English expeditions to the Spanish Main during the war militarily and financially.Nichols/Williams p 66 Background In early 1591 an English fleet had been organised for a raiding expedition to the Spanish West Indies. The expedition had been financed in a joint stock venture and was organised into three fleets. The first and main fleet was financed largely by John Watts, but also had investment from Walter Raleigh, Paul Bayning, and Sir Francis Drake. The expedition's captain was William Lane of the 120-ton Centaur, while second-in-command was Captain Michael Geare in the 150-ton Little John, and the 80-ton Pegasus under Captain Stephen Michell and the pinnace Fifth Part. The back up fleet was composed of two ships – Margaret of 60 tons under Captain Christopher Newport and the 50-ton Prudence under Captain John Burough. The other part of the fleet had been financed largely by Sir George Carew – the 200-ton Hopewell (alias Harry and John) of Captain William Craston, the 130-ton bark Burr of under Captain William Irish, the 35-ton Swallow under Ralph Lee, and the 30-ton Content under Captain Nicholas Lisle.Southey p 389 They were to attack and raid any Spanish or Portuguese shipping in the area of Hispaniola and Cuba with the aim of making a profit. =Expedition= They set out from Plymouth in the Spring of 1591, swinging by way of the coast of Spain as a ruse to fool the Spanish as to their real destination. In April 1591 while off Cadiz Margaret under Newport and Prudence caught site of a large Spanish ship; a large bark which was soon captured. Newport found in the prize bullion, money, hides, precious stones, wine, and other valuables. Newport sent the prize home and the fleet proceeded west toward Cuba and rendezvoused with some of the fleet between Saint Kitts and Puerto Rico in May 1591. Despite the weather separating many ships they all arrived in the Bahamas a week later.Andrews pp 165–66 The expedition's first success came in late May when a 150-ton Spanish merchantman Rosario of Master Francisco González was captured by Marageret and Prudence near La Yaguana off Hispaniola. Rosario’s crew was released but their vessel was pillaged for any valuables of which some were found. The prisoners informed the English that a Spanish fleet of seven galleons, two galleys, and two pinnaces with 2,000 men in total were destined to arrive in the area of Western Cuba. This force was under the command of Admiral Don Diego de la Ribera in command of the Tierra Firme fleet. He had left Havana in early June to sweep any English privateers from the designated area as this was in anticipation of a plate fleet led by Antonio Navarro de Prado. Blockade The English therefore decided on a blockade of Western Cuba and risked the confrontation with Ribera. The English took up position near Corrientes in mid-June to await the arrival of Spanish ships. =Corrientes= On 23 June Burr, Hopewell, Swallow, and Content arrived between Cape Corrientes and Cape San Antonio and soon sighted six sail. Having believed they might have been treasure ships from Cartagena the English closed, only to discover the force was Ribera’s 700-ton flagship Galleon Nuestra Señora del Rosario, Vice Admiral Aparicio de Arteaga’s 650-ton Magdalena, two other large galleons, and a pair of galleys. Despite being heavily outnumbered the English stood formation and a long-range exchange commenced at 7:00 am. This lasted for the next three hours, after which the English formation scattered. During this time Burr exploded from a catastrophic fire in the magazine either from a stray Spanish shot or by complete accident. Irish and sixteen survivors were rescued by the Swallow which soon after withdrew from the area. Soon after the 100-ton galleys San Agustín and Brava then closed in on the two remaining English vessels and attempted to board by grappling. They were however repelled by heavy gunfire from Hopewell and Content in a defensive position. The Spanish galleys, unable to make an impression and suffering considerable damage then stood off and rejoined de la Ribera's galleons. Soon after the English ships departed and sailed to Cape San Antonio but sighted nothing of value. Content got lost during the night and was unable to find any other ships and may have headed all the way to Florida. On 29 June Hopewell and Swallow returned to Cape Corrientes to find no sign of any Spanish ships under de la Ribera. Both ships soon met up with Centaur, Pegasus, Little John, Prudence, and Fifth Part. They were joined by Captain John Oker’s Lion, a lone ship from Southampton operating independently. On 3 July while part of the formation was watering inshore off Corrientes; Pegasus and Centaur caught sight of a number Spanish ships. After a quick pursuit they overhauled and captured the 150-ton Spanish armed merchantmen Santa Catalina under Captain Martín Francisco de Armendáriz, and the 100-ton escorting frigata Regalo de Dios. At the same time the other escorting frigata was trapped and captured by Lion and Swallow. The Spanish ships had been bound from Santo Domingo to Havana carrying valuables which included precious stones and hides. =Havana= A 17th century depiction of Havana On 5 July, the English agreed to all sail together with their prizes until they passed the Cuban capital. Upon having reached Matanzas; Prudence and Lion continued up the Old Bahama Channel toward England with their prizes. The next day Centaur, Pegasus, Hopewell, Little John, Swallow, and Fifth Part reversed course to take up station to blockade the west of Havana. Despite the risk of the more heavily armed galleons of Ribera aimed at destroying them, the six English ships awaited incoming Spanish ships. On the morning of 15 July Pegasus and Little John sighted a large Spanish ship. The English sailed towards her, attacked the ship, and after heavy hand-to-hand combat and a number of casualties, they boarded and overwhelmed the Spaniard forcing its surrender. The captured Spanish ship was the 300-ton Spanish galleon which turned out to be the San Juan; her captain Agustín de Paz was heading from Veracruz to Havana. The San Juan was thoroughly pillaged, after which she was then burned with the prisoners taken ashore. From the prisoners and documents they learned that a Spanish convoy was behind the San Juan. On the same day more success came to the English as Swallow, Centaur, Hopewell, and Fifth Part pursued four Spanish coastal ships which were surrounded and captured. They were pillaged and two were used as store ships while the other two were burned. Early the next day, the first elements of the main Spanish convoy had arrived in the area from Veracruz under Admiral Navarro. The English took watch and an opportunity came about when one of the lookouts spotted a lone ship; noted as being too far ahead of the rest of the convoy. At midday Centaur and Little John attacked and boarded the vessel from the rear, while the Pegasus pounded the starboard side of the ship. After a sharp half an hour fight in which William Lane was injured, the ship was taken. The captured prize was a 240-ton armed merchant galleon from Seville, the Santa Trinidad under Captain Alonso Hidalgo. The Santa Trinidad prize proved so rich that Lane immediately ordered the English to quit their watch outside Havana and protect the ship at all costs. They sailed home before the rest of the Spanish plate fleet along with Ribera sortied on its homeward leg. Aftermath The English fleet arrived at Plymouth a few months later with the eight captured ships amid much rejoicing. In all Watt's expedition was a huge success – eight prizes were taken in all worth a total of £40,000 which produced on investment of at least 200 per cent regardless of embezzlement and pillage which crew members committed to supplement their normal one third share granted in lieu of wages. Half of this went to Queen Elizabeth I, the Lord Admiral Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham with the rest shared between Watts and Raleigh. The Trinidad was the richest yielding £20,000 alone with silver, hides, and cochineal. Watt's had taken most of the prizes and the money, and Carew who funded a small part asked Sir Julius Caesar to intervene on a matter of fair distribution.Andrews p 26 The Spanish on the other hand had been frustrated – de La Ribera had failed to clear any of the English from Western Cuba and could do little about the blockade. The Spanish Governor of Cuba Juan de Tejeda complained bitterly particularly as the English had sent him letters and compliments during the blockade: The blockade of Western Cuba was one of the most successful English expeditions of the war militarily and financially. The following year more expeditions were launched by the English led by Christopher Newport and funded again by Watts and Lane. Although they didn't repeat the huge success of the previous year's expedition, their operations forced the Spanish to delay the departure of two Treasure fleets. As a result, they only reached Spain in the Spring of 1593.Bradley p 100  References  ;Citations ;Bibliography    * Category:Naval battles of the Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604) Category:Conflicts in 1591 Category:16th century in the Caribbean Category:1591 in the British Empire Category:1591 in the Spanish Empire ","title":"Blockade of Western Cuba"},{"id":"48360780","text":"Bint Pasha (7 March 1984 - 2006) was an American-bred British-trained Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare. She showed promise as a juvenile in 1986 when she won once and finished fourth in the Fillies' Mile. In the following year she emerged as a top class performer when moved up in distance, finishing fourth in the Oaks Stakes before winning the Pretty Polly Stakes in Ireland, the Yorkshire Oaks in England and the Prix Vermeille in France. She failed to win in three starts in 1988 and was retired from racing. She had some success as a broodmare, producing at least eight winners. Background Bint Pasha was a \\"rangy\\", dark-coated chestnut mare bred in Kentucky by Spendthrift Thoroughbred Breeding. She was from the fourth crop of foals sired by Affirmed, the winner of the American Triple Crown in 1978. The best of his other progeny included Flawlessly, Peteski and The Tin Man. Bint Pasha was the only foal produced by her dam, Icely Polite, a winner of four minor races who died in 1984 at the age of five. Icely Polite was a distant descendant of the American broodmare Judy O'Grady who was the ancestor of many important winners including Green Dancer, Authorized and Dream Well. The filly was consigned as a yearling to the Fasig-Tipton Sale in August 1985 and was bought for $220,000 by the bloodstock agent Anthony Penfold on behalf of Fahd Salman. She was sent to Europe and entered training with Paul Cole at Whatcombe stables in Oxfordshire. She was ridden in most of her races by Richard Quinn. Racing career =1986: two-year-old season= As a two-year-old in 1986 Bint Basha finished second in her first three races. In July at Sandown Park Racecourse she recorded her first success when she won a maiden race over seven furlongs by five lengths. She was then moved up in class for the Group Three May Hill Stakes over one mile at Doncaster Racecourse in September and finished seventh behind Laluche in a slowly-run race. Later that month she started a 33/1 outsider for the Group Two Fillies' Mile at Ascot Racecourse and produced her best effort of the year to finish fourth behind Invited Guest, Mountain Memory and Shining Water. =1987: three-year-old season= After finishing unplaced over one mile on her three-year-old debut, Bint Pasha showed improved form when moved up in distance for the Lupe Stakes (a trial race for The Oaks) over ten furlongs at Goodwood Racecourse in May. She led for most of the way but was caught approaching the final furlong and beaten two lengths by the Henry Cecil-trained Scimitarra. On 6 June at Epsom Downs Racecourse Bint Pasha started a 66/1 outsider in an eleven-runner field the 209th running of the Oaks. After falling behind the leaders approaching the final turn (she was reportedly unsuited by the course) she stayed on in the straight to finish fourth behind Unite, Bourbon Girl and Three Tails. Scimitarra had started 5/2 favourite but sustained a career-ending injury in the last quarter mile. Later in June she was sent to Ireland for the Pretty Polly Stakes over ten furlongs at the Curragh. Racing on soft ground for the first time she recorded her first major success, beating the Barry Hills-trained Blessed Event by a head with the pair finishing well clear of the opposition. Bint Pasha faced Blessed Event again in the Yorkshire Oaks over one and a half miles at York Racecourse on 18 August. Three Tails started favourite on 5/2 after winning the Lancashire Oaks with Bourbon Girl (who had finished second to Unite in the Irish Oaks) the second choice at 3/1. Bint Pasha and Blessed Event were next in the betting on 5/1 whilst the other runners were Eurobird (later to win the Irish St Leger), Island Lake (third in the Lancashire Oaks), Shining Water, Known Line and Debach Delight. Quinn tracked the leaders before sending the filly into the lead three furlongs out. Bint Pasha held off a sustained challenge from Blessed Event to win by one and a half lengths with a gap of six lengths back to Bourbon Girl in third. On 13 September, Bint Pasha was sent to France and started favourite for the Prix Vermeille over 2400 metres at Longchamp Racecourse, a race which serves as a trial for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. Three Tails and Blessed Event were again in opposition whilst the other runners included Teresa (the top three-year-old in Spain), Khariyda (later to win the E. P. Taylor Stakes and the Premio Lydia Tesio), River Memories (Prix Maurice de Nieuil, Prix de Pomone), Karmiska (Prix de la Nonette) and Swept Away (Prix Chloé). Ridden by Pat Eddery, she took the lead soon after the start and opened up a three length advantage entering the straight. She was never seriously challenged and won by two and a half lengths from Three Tails with the outsider Something True taking third ahead of Khariyda. Bint Pasha bypassed the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and ended her season with a trip to California for the Breeders' Cup Turf at Hollywood Park Racetrack on 21 November. She reportedly responded badly to the journey and finished last of the fourteen runners behind Theatrical. =1988: four-year- old season= Bint Pasha remained in training as a four-year-old but failed to win in three races. She finished last of four behind Triptych in the Coronation Cup and eighth of ten behind Village Star in the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud. On her final appearance she finished fourth of the seven runners behind Ela Romara in the Nassau Stakes at Goodwood on 30 July. Assessment In 1986, Bint Pasha was given a rating of 102 by the independent Timeform organisation, making her 25 pounds inferior to their top-rated juvenile filly Forest Flower. In the official Free Handicap for the year, she was allotted a weight of 112 pounds, nineteen pounds behind Forest Flower. In the following yer she received a Timeform ratin of 126, seven pounds behind the top-rated three-year-old filly Miesque. In the official International Classification she was rated the second-best three-year-old filly in Europe in the 11 furlongs plus didvision, two pounds below Unite. In their annual Racehorses of 1987, Timeform described her as \\"thoroughly genuine, and one of the leading middle- distance fillies of her year\\". Breeding record Bint Pasha was retired from racing to become a broodmare for her owner's Newgate Stud. In December 2002 she was consigned to the Tattersalls sale and was bought for 170,000 guineas by the bloodstock agent Hugh Lascelles. Bint Pasha died in 2006. She produced at least twelve foals and eight winners between 1990 and 2003: *Revere, a bay colt, foaled in 1990, sired by Dancing Brave. Won seven races including Premio Citta di Napoli, Foundation Stakes, Gala Stakes. *Nadra, bay filly, 1991, by Sadler's Wells.

It was built in 1933, replacing five one roomed schools. Today, the Block Island School educates about 160 students, kindergarten through senior year. A regular school day, Monday through Thursday, runs from 7:50 am – 2:50 pm. Every Friday, school dismisses at 12:22 pm to allow for student-athletes to travel for sporting events either on, or off the island. Athletics The Block Island Hurricanes compete in three main sports, each played during different seasons. =Soccer= In the fall, the BI Hurricanes have both a junior high soccer team which consists of 6th, 7th, and 8th graders, and a varsity soccer team which consists of high school students. Both soccer teams are co-ed because of the limited numbers throughout the school. In 2014, the Block Island Hurricanes finished as the first seed in the Coastal Prep League and went on to win the 2014 CPL Championship against Oxford Academy. They followed up a dominating season with another good run at the championship, but fell short in a 3-1 upset by Blackstone Valley Prep. =Basketball= During the winter, the Block Island School students play basketball. There is a Junior High Girls, a Junior High Boys, a Varsity Girls, and a Varsity Boys basketball team. Each of the three teams experienced some extent of success throughout the 2014-2015 season. The junior high teams showed promising talent that will later help the varsity teams in future years. The varsity girls produced one of their most impressive seasons in recent school history. This included senior Kiley Hall being named a 2014-2015 Rhode Island Interscholastic Basketball League All-Star for Division III basketball. During this same year, she also became the third player in school history to achieve 1,000 career high school points joining Ross Draper and Derek Marsella. As for the Block Island Varsity Boys basketball team, they achieved total success in their season. They experienced an undefeated season (in league) and went on to win the 2014-2015 coastal prep league championship for boys basketball. With only seven players on the roster, every one of them influenced each game. This is the only time in school history that the Hurricanes have won the championship in two different sports during one year. The 2015-2016 boys basketball season was highlighted by gritty play from the young six man roster who finished with a surprising 8-8 league record. Richard Conant also became Block Islands fourth 1,000 point scorer. =Baseball= The BIS students also compete in baseball and softball in the spring. There are junior high and varsity teams for both baseball and softball. Male, spring athletes take part in baseball events while female athletes compete versus other softball teams. The varsity softball team worked well during the 2015 season winning more than half of their games. During the 2015 season, the boys varsity baseball team showed dominance. They only lost one league game and went on to win the coastal prep league championship for baseball. This marked history once again representing the first time that students have won the championship in each sport in one year. Because of the small number of students on the little island, six student athletes competed on all three championship winning teams: Timothy O'Neill, Mason Littlefield, Griffen Hall, Richard Conant, Ryan McGarry, and Jameson Brown-Padien. They are known as the \\"Silent Six\\".

Early years Jacques-Guillaume Legrand was born on 9 May 1753 in Paris. He studied at the Louis-le-Grand College, then entered the National School of Bridges and Roads (École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées, ENPC), where his ability caught the attention of Jean-Rodolphe Perronet, the founder of the school. While still at the ENPC he also took lessons from Jacques-François Blondel at the Royal Academy of Architecture (Académie royale d'architecture). It was here that he met Jacques Molinos, with whom he would often work in the future. Molinos was ten years older. Legrand learned neoclassical concepts from Blondel. After Blondel died he took lessons from Charles-Louis Clérisseau, whose daughter he married. Halle aux blés Legrand and Molinos visited Italy together, where Legrand examined the monuments using the book by Antoine Desgodetz as his guide. He made notes in this book, and corrected some errors. He planned to use the notes for a revised edition, but he unwisely entrusted them to another man who passed them off as his own. The two friends visited the temples of Paestum, and were going to visit Magna Graecia when they were recalled to France. Career In 1783 Legrand and Molinos built a dome over the courtyard of the Corn Exchange (Halle aux blés, Paris), which Nicolas Le Camus de Mézières (1721–1789) had built in 1763 with a circular rotunda and open courtyard colonnade. The dome was of pine planks sheathed in copper and lead and topped by a lantern of iron. The design was based on the principles of Philibert de l'Orme. They used glazed panels to introduce light into the courtyard. The dome had a diameter of , but did not require changes to the existing structure, and became a visitor attraction. Thomas Jefferson commented on the ingenious design. Théâtre Feydeau Legrand undertook public and private commissions, and also wrote as an art critic. The Minister of the Interior gave Legrand the task of restoring the monuments of Paris. The prefect of the department assigned him to the committee charged with supervising buildings. Legrand and Molinos built the Cloth Hall in 1786, destroyed in 1855. The cloth market vault was supported on terracotta tubes, and the roof was covered with copper. In its day the cloth market roof was almost as well known as the dome of the corn market. Legrand and Molinos worked on developing the Paris markets, and also designed the Théâtre Feydeau in the rue de Richelieu. Legrand was charged with restoring the Église de Saint-Denis and the sepulcher of the kings, and moved to the site to supervise the work. He became ill from overexertion, and died in Saint-Denis on 10 November 1808. He was buried in the cemetery of Auteuil. Publications Legrand began work on a huge General History of Architecture, but it was not completed or published.

Since 2011, Seidman has also written The How Column, which has appeared in several publications and previously appeared in Business Week. He has also given presentations about the topic. Origins The book was created based on Seidman's training in law and moral philosophy, and what he learned at the organizational consulting firm he founded, LRN, Seidman developed the \\"shared values\\" recommendations of How at LRN, which for his company are humility, integrity, passion and truth. Thomas Friedman has expanded the How framework in a series of New York Times columns, usually involving interviews with Seidman, to apply to societal issues involving moral philosophy. These include the interaction of privacy and technology, attacks on democracy, the purpose of humanity after technology displaces work; and the escalation of \\"moral outrage\\" to protests. An expanded version of the book with a foreword by Bill Clinton appeared in 2011. By November of that year the expanded version was at number 13 in the \\"Advice, How-To, and Miscellaneous\\" section of the New York Times best-seller list. Overview Seidman argues that the intention of leaders to have their organizations behave well is not enough, and that \\"blind obedience\\" to leaders and rules is much less effective in creating a successful organization than one where shared values are internalized and believed by staff who govern their own behavior. Self-governance organizations can respond better than one where rules and commands are viewed as obstacles to be skirted. Seidman argues that technology has allowed individual behavior to affect the contemporary world much more than it has previously, for good or bad. The book says that companies that earn trust can translate that trust into direct economic benefits, such as more consumer sales or being charged lower interest rates. Through transparency and trust, an organization improves its reputation, which translates into more long-term business.

It provides the legal framework for federal records management, including record creation, maintenance, and disposition.Richard J. Cox, Closing an Era: Historical Perspectives on Modern Archives and Records Management (Greenwood: 2000), pp. 3-4. History The Federal Records Act was created following the recommendations of the Hoover Commission (1947-49). The act, and its related regulations, require each federal agency to establish an ongoing program for record management and to cooperate with the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). A 1985 NARA pamphlet describes the Federal Records Act as the \\"basis for the Federal Government's policies and procedures for creating, maintaining, and disposing of Federal records. The act and its related regulations define Federal records, mandate the creation and preservation of those records necessary to document Federal activities, establish Government ownership of records, and provide the exclusive legal procedures for the disposition of records.\\" The Second Hoover Commission (1953-55) addressed paperwork management and recommended the adoption of a program relating to \\"directives management, reports management, paperwork quality control, and clerical work measurement.\\" As a result, the first Guide to Record Retention Requirements was published in 1955. This guide is updated annually and is used by archivists and other record managers both in and out of government. The Federal Records Act was amended over time. Amendments in 1976 emphasized paperwork reduction and information lifecycle management. The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, which followed the issuance of the report of the Commission on Federal Paperwork in 1977, introduced information resources management and gave responsibility to the Office of Management and Budget for creating federal information policy standards. In November 2014, the Presidential and Federal Records Act Amendments of 2014 was signed into law by President Barack Obama.National Archives Welcomes Presidential and Federal Records Act Amendments of 2014 (press release), National Archives and Records Administration (December 1, 2014).Charles S. Clark, Obama Signs Modernized Federal Records Act, Government Executive (December 1, 2014). This bipartisan act, which followed the 2011 President's Memorandum on Managing Government Records, modernizes the Federal Records Act. The act expressly expands the definition of federal records to include electronic records (the first change to the definition of \\"Federal record\\" since the enactment of the act in 1950). The act also grants the Archivist of the United States the final determination as to what constitutes a Federal record; \\"authorizes the early transfer of permanent electronic federal and presidential records to the National Archives, while legal custody remains with the agency or the president\\"; \\"clarifies the responsibilities of federal government officials when using non-government email systems\\"; and \\"empowers the National Archives to safeguard original and classified records from unauthorized removal.\\" Notes See also * Diplomatics * Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 * Freedom of Information Act (United States) * Government transparency * National Personnel Records Center and National Personnel Records Center fire * Presidential Records Act of 1978 * Privacy Act of 1974 * Right to know * Washington National Records Center Category:1950 in American law Category:Information technology management Category:Public records Category:United States federal government administration legislation ","title":"Federal Records Act"},{"id":"48361358","text":"Faheem Ahmed (born 22 December 1980) is a Pakistani first-class cricketer who played for Karachi.

Education and career Juel went to school in Svendborg and from 1871 studied at the Technical University of Denmark. From 1876 he studied mathematics at the University of Copenhagen; there he received In 1879 his undergraduate degree in mathematics and in 1885 his Ph.D. (promotion) with thesis Inledning i de imaginaer linies og den imaginaer plans geometrie. From 1894 he was a docent at the Technical University of Denmark, where he became in 1897 a full professor; during this time he also sometimes lectured at the University of Copenhagen. Juel did research on projective geometry, algebraic curves, polyhedra, and surfaces of revolution from ovals. In projective geometry, he generalized results of Karl von Staudt and independently obtained results similar to those of Corrado Segre. In addition to a monograph on projective geometry, Juel wrote textbooks dealing with stereometry, rational mechanics, and introductory mathematics for chemists. From 1889 to 1915 he was an editor of Matematisk Tidsskrift. In 1922 he was made a member of the Finnish Academy of Sciences. In 1925 he was made a member of the Norwegian Academy of Sciences and an honorary member of the Danish Mathematical Association. In 1928 he was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians at Bologna and gave a talk Beispiele von Elementarkurven und Elementarflächen. His wife's father was the mathematician and astronomer Thorvald Nicolai Thiele. Juel was awarded in 1913 a rank of Knight (Ridder) in 1913 and in 1921 a rank of the Cross of Honour (Dannebrogordenens hæderstegn) of the Order of Dannebrog.

The occupants came from Borshchiv and with Ozeryany, Melnytsia- Podilska, Skala-Podilska, Kryvche, Korolivka partly Chortkiv and Zolochiv. On 26 September 1942 about 100 prisoners, mostly old and sick, were shot on the square, and about 800 were sent to Bełżec . A group of youth was sent to Yaniv concentration camp in Lviv . On 13 March 1943 other 400 people were sent to Bełżec. On 19 April 1943 German and Ukrainian police shot about 800 people in a Jewish cemetery (in the outskirts of town, on the road to the village Verhnyakivtsi). On 5 June another 700 people were executed at the cemetery. From 9 to 14 June 1943, an additional 1800 ghetto prisoners were killed. Then the Nazis considered Borschiv \\"Judenfrei\\" (\\"free of Jews\\"). Some Jews, however, were hiding in various recesses both in the ghetto and in other places. So occupation authorities announced that those who come out by themselves would not be destroyed, and would be in a labor camp.

Local farmers helped the Jews by bringing them food and reporting some news. For example, one farmer gave them a wain of barley.

It was formed in 2013 by the engineer Muhammad al-Sa'eed. The fighters who call themselves the 'Syrian Arab Army Fedayeen' are active in Aleppo, distributed on the periphery of the camp and south of al-Nayrab military and civil airport. They are also present in Aziza village, Sheikh Latfi, and around the Air Intelligence building and the Greatest Messenger mosque. The group is composed of predominantly Sunni Palestinians from the al- Nayrab district as well as the former refugee camp Handarat. Liwa al-Quds is believed to be the largest loyalist auxiliary force operating in Aleppo.  History  The militia was founded in 2013, reportedly with the support of the Air Force Intelligence Directorate. Syrian opposition supporters regard them as Shabiha. By the beginning of 2015, the group had suffered 200 killed and over 400 wounded since its establishment. The group supported the Syrian Army in its effort to reopen the main supply line to Aleppo in late 2015. By mid-2016, it had become one of the most important pro-government militias in Aleppo Governorate. On 20 June 2016, the militia took part in a prisoner exchange with three rebel factions, namely the Sultan Murad Division, the Muntasir Billah Brigade, and the Nour al-Din al-Zenki Movement, in coordination with Ahrar al-Sham. In June 2017, Liwa al-Quds launched a recruitment campaign in Homs Governorate, where it aimed at enlisting young Palestinian refugees. In May 2018 Liwa al-Quds was fighting against the ISIL pocket in the desert of Deir ez-Zor Governorate as a part of joint operation with the NDF and SAA forces. Liwa al-Quds captured village of Faydat Umm Muwaynah. In July 2018, Samer Rafe, a prominent commander of the militia, was arrested in Latakia after a firefight with government forces. He had previously been arrested on charges of robbery in Aleppo, confessed to the charges, and served a prison term of one year before being released. In the first half of 2019, Liwa al-Quds suffered heavy casualties on multiple fronts, most notably during Operation Dawn of Idlib.  Compostition  The brigade has both Syrian Palestinian as well as native Syrian members. The militia has close connections to Russia, and is supplied as well as trained by the Russian Armed Forces. Its fighters refer to themselves as \\"Syrian Arab Army Fedayeen\\", showcasing their loyalty to the Syrian military. Before the government victory in the Battle of Aleppo, the brigade consisted of three main battalions, which are: Lions of al-Quds Battalion, which operated in al-Nayrab camp and its surrounding as well as in southern and eastern countryside of Aleppo; the Deterrence Battalion, which operated in the north Aleppo countryside south of the villages of Nubl and Al-Zahraa; and the Lions of al-Shahba' Battalion, which operated inside Aleppo city. By 2018, the group had started recruiting former Syrian rebels that agreed to join pro-government military units as part of reconciliation deals with the Syrian government. More than 150 former Free Syrian Army fighters had joined Liwa al-Quds by 2019. They received military training and supervision from Russian officers during the first quarter of 2019.

Pernambuco is located in the Northeast region of Brazil. The state includes Olinda, the second oldest city in Brazil. The state's anthem exalts its beauty, historical achievements, and the past of the people of Pernambuco. The lyrics were written by Oscar Brandão da Rocha and the music was composed by Nicolino Milano. It is a well- known music from Pernambuco because, apart from it being taught at local schools, it is often performed during sporting events like soccer, volleyball, and basketball. The song is also played in advertisements throughout the state. In 2002, the Government of the State of Pernambuco, in partnership with the city of Recife and the Secretary of State for Tourism, promoted greater awareness of the hymn through its rewriting in various rhythms such as frevo, forró and manguebeat. Artists like Alceu Valenca, Dominguinhos, and Cannibal took part in this project.  Lyrics  Coração do Brasil, em teu seio corre o sangue de heróis - rubro veio que há de sempre o valor traduzir.

Baba Shemimi (or Shemim), whose full name was Kemaledin Shemimi Ibrahim,Monumented e rrethit te Elbasanit dhe rendesia e tyre (in Albanian) was initially a Sunni Muslim hodja and müderris (religious teacher). He got in touch with the Bektashi Sufi doctrine in the Köprülü tekke (today Veles, North Macedonia), together with his friend Hatemi Haidar Baba. He built the tekke of Fushë-Krujë on his return. Baba Shemimi was a close acquaintance of Ali Pasha Tepelena, Vizier of the Janina Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire. He was the one who initiated Ali Pasha as a Bektashi. With the support of Ali, he built additional tekkes in Melçan, Xhefaji Baba tekke in Elbasan (Xhefaji Ibraim Babai was a dervish under Baba Shemin), Sadik Baba Tekke in Koshtan (near Memaliaj), etc. He is mentioned as highly mystical. He was also a Sufi poet, and his poetry was very direct with high notes of criticism toward public figures and social injustices of the time. During his era, Baba Shemimi was the most famous Bektashi leader in Albania. The Dollma Tekke of Krujë had 360 holy tombs and was known as \\"the small Khorasan\\". Baba Shemimi was assassinated in 1831, by the men of Kapllan Pasha Toptani from the most-powerful Ottoman Albanian family (Toptani) of the area. This is mentioned in the elegy that the bejte period poet Zenel Bastari wrote for him after his death.

Early life Arthur Schoellkopf was born in Buffalo on June 13, 1856, the third son of industrialist Jacob F. Schoellkopf (1819–1899) and Christiana T. Duerr (1827–1903). He started his education at private schools in Buffalo and when he was 9 years old he was sent to the Academy of Kirchheim in Germany, where he spent the next four years. Upon returning to the United States, Arthur finished his schooling at St. Joseph's Collegiate Institute in Buffalo and then attended Bryant and Stratton College. Career =Business career= Interior of Power House of the Electric Street Railway in 1891 In 1873, upon completion of his studies, he went to work for the \\"North Buffalo and Frontier Mills\\" in Buffalo, operated by \\"Thornton & Chester\\", and afterward, \\"Schoellkopf & Matthews.\\" He worked at Frontier Mills for four years, and in 1877, became a part owner of \\"Niagara Flouring Mill\\" at Niagara Falls. By 1908, Schoellkopf was president of \\"Niagara Falls Milling Company,\\" which included the \\"Central Mill\\" and the \\"Niagara Flouring Mill.\\" In 1877, his father purchased the Hydraulic Canal at Niagara Falls and in 1878, they formed the Niagara Falls Hydraulic Power and Manufacturing Company, Arthur became secretary, treasurer and general manager of the business. New York side of the gorge, c. 1901In 1881, along with his father Jacob and Charles Brush, they founded of the \\"Brush Electric Light Company of Buffalo\\" which built an electric generator that operated by mechanical power, supplied by the canal water, which used 16 carbon arc lights to illuminate Niagara Falls at night. The Brush Electric Light Company of Buffalo\\" and the \\"Thomson-Houston Electric Light and Power Company of Buffalo\\" later consolidated into the \\"Buffalo General Electric Company\\" on August 1, 1892 In 1882, Schoellkopf constructed the first horse-drawn street car system in Niagara Falls (known as the \\"Niagara Falls and Suspension Bridge Street Railway\\") completed July 4, 1883, and was manager of that company until 1890 when he sold his interest as it became part of the International Railway system.

The Farm was a stud farm and bred some of the finest horses in the United States, including the champion trotter \\"Niagara King.\\" The Farm also included a piggery and a hennery on the property. =Political career= In March 1896, Arthur Schoellkopf was elected mayor of the City of Niagara Falls. His campaign slogan was \\"municipal government is business, not politics\\" and he was overwhelmingly elected by every district in the city. In an 1897 article, his administration was characterized by \\"no scandals, no jangles in the Common Council; the sessions have been business like and have not lasted all night… he has made the best Mayor we have had.\\" After a year in office, Schoellkopf made the decision not to run for a second term citing that \\"his private business would not allow him to devote the necessary time to the city's affairs\\" and so he declined the Republican mayoral nomination for 1897. Personal life In 1880, Arthur married Jessie Gluck, daughter of Alva Gluck, one of Niagara Falls' most prominent citizens and builder of the \\"Gluck Building,\\" a local landmark from 1892 until it burned down in 1959. Together, Arthur and Jessie had two children: *Margaret Beatrice Schoellkopf (1881–1965), who married Thomas Jefferson Penn (1875-1946) and moved to Reidsville, North Carolina). *Paul Arthur Schoellkopf (1884-1947), who married Mattie Irwin Penn (1885-1973) in 1911 In 1879, Arthur built a large stone house on a triangular piece of property bounded by Main Street, Pine Avenue and Park Place. The house was torn down in 1935 to make way for a tire store, but the stone wall that surrounded the property is still there. Schoellkopf was a member of Niagara Frontier Lodge No. 132, F. & A. M., Knights Templar and of Ismailia Temple, Nobles of the Mystic Shrine of Buffalo. He was also exalted Ruler of Lodge No. 346, Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks. He belonged to the \\"Niagara Falls Chamber of Commerce,\\" the \\"Ellicott Club of Buffalo,\\" and a member and Trustee of the First Presbyterian Church of Niagara Falls. Schoellkopf's son, Paul, later served as president of the consolidated Niagara Falls Power Company. =Death= In the 1910s, Schoellkopf's health became impaired by unnamed \\"complicated disorders.\\" He sought relief from his ailments by spending the winters in Florida. He died unexpectedly, at 56 years old, in Miami on February 3, 1913, of complications from a \\"serious illness.\\" After a funeral service at the First Presbyterian Church on First Street, Schoellkopf's remains were placed in a vault at Oakwood Cemetery in Niagara Falls to be buried later in the family plot at Forest Lawn in Buffalo, New York. It was later decided by the family to have him remain in Niagara Falls, so Schoellkopf and his wife Jessie, who died in 1928 (at her residence 1 West 70th Street in New York City) are interred in the mausoleum at Oakwood Cemetery. =Philanthropy and legacy= DeVeaux School Schoellkopf was one of the founders of the Niagara Falls Memorial Hospital in 1895, as well as the Niagara Falls branch of the YMCA that same year. In 1906, Schoellkopf was approached by Peter A. Porter to donate a small triangular lot across from his residence in Niagara Falls, New York (at Main and Pine) for use as a city park. Porter asked Schoellkopf to \\"advise us as to the possibilities of its being so secured at this time.\\" The Schoellkopf turned the property over to the city, and in 1920, the parcel became the \\"Soldiers, Sailors and Marines Memorial Park.\\" Since that time, other veterans memorials have been added to the park. \\"Schoellkopf Park,\\" along Portage Road between Pine Avenue and Walnut Avenue, was a gift from Schoellkopf's wife, Jessie, in memory of Arthur. \\"Schoellkopf Hall\\" at the DeVeaux School (now De Veaux Woods State Park) was named for Arthur's son Paul, and the Schoellkopf Geological Museum (now the Niagara Gorge Discovery Center) was so named because it was built on the site of the former Schoellkopf Power Plant that fell into the Niagara Gorge in 1956.

Geiger blamed Reed for the disappearance of the drug. Friends, family, and teachers remember Reed as an outgoing person who aspired to fly. Reed's death remained unsolved for 20 years, until the case was reopened in 2005 by the Schuylkill Haven police department. Geiger was arrested in 2008 on the 23rd anniversary of Reed's death and was found guilty of third-degree murder, involuntary manslaughter, evidence tampering, and abuse of corpse, among other offenses.  Murder  Reed and his siblings, James and Virginia, had begun using marijuana from young adolescence, and had even begun dealing it themselves during 1985. On the night of August 21, 1985, 13-year-old Reed left home on his bicycle to meet up with friends 20-year-old Joe Geiger and 14-year-old John F. Fry, Jr., to drink beer and smoke pot in an abandoned caboose at the local train station. After a while, Geiger began to accuse Reed of stealing his illegally grown cannabis plants. Suddenly, Geiger stood up and shocked Reed and Fry by roundhouse punching Reed in the head, causing Reed to fall out of the caboose and slam his skull into the metal rails of the train tracks. Reed was knocked unconscious but was still breathing. Geiger told Fry to leave at this point. Fry, intimidated by the older boy's larger stature, left. Fry did not participate in the actual murder and cover-up of the murder that followed. Years later, he admitted to police that he had had no idea of Reed's death until Reed's body was discovered. Geiger then carried Reed's body a few hundred yards into the surrounding woods in Cressona where he left the body. The location of Reed's body was less than 100 yards from the Reed's home, however the body was not discovered until December 1985. Reed's mother called police when David failed to return home the next day.  Initial investigation  In December 1985, Geiger reported to the Schuylkill Haven police department that—over the course of 3 to 4 months—his two pet dogs had been retrieving bones from the woods in Cressona, where he often allowed them to play. Geiger said that he had no idea the bones were human until the dogs had brought back a human skull. The body was identified positively as that of David W. Reed by authorities. Police noted that the body was about a half mile from his bicycle. Because he was the one to report the discovery of Reed's body, both the authorities and Reed's family did not suspect Geiger played a role in Reed's death. In fact, authorities did not suspect foul play at all. Although they did report that the death seemed \\"suspicious,\\" they were satisfied with a coroner's at the University of Penn's conclusion that Reed plausibly had died of previously undiagnosed diabetes complications upon autopsy. The actual case files ruled the death as \\"undetermined\\" in April 1986, and the case laid cold for the next 20 years.  Case reopened  In 2005, the Schuylkill Haven police department decided to reopen the case of Reed's mysterious death per the request of Virginia Reed Meadows, Reed's sister. Meadows had died the year beforehand and police decided to finally adhere to her pleas. The surviving members of the Reed family were pleased with the decision to officially reopen the case, saying that the original investigation had been \\"inadequate.\\" Corporal Robert S. Betnar was assigned to the investigation. He discovered inconsistencies with Geiger's testimonies during the initial investigation and dug deeper into the case. Geiger, now 43, was unemployed and residing in nearby Pottsville with a wife and young son. Betnar decided to redo the investigation from scratch. = New leads = New testimonies from multiple friends of Geiger's confessed that Geiger had mentioned throughout the years things that alluded to him killing Reed. In 2007, Christopher Mager told troopers that Geiger had told him at a party some years ago that Geiger had jokingly told him while high on cocaine, \\"If you ever want to murder somebody, do it in Schuylkill County because you can get away with it.\\" Mager said that when he asked Geiger who he had killed, Geiger had told him, \\"Reed.\\" Some friends also recall that in 1985, around the time Reed allegedly began stealing marijuana from Geiger, that Geiger had sworn he was going to murder whoever was stealing the drugs, and that he was determined to figure out the culprit. Fry, then 37, confessed to police that he believes he was an eyewitness to the murder of Reed, and gave the investigators his side of the story. He made clear that he did not participate in the actual death or cover-up, and had not known that Geiger had actually killed Reed until Reed's body was discovered in December 1985. He also admitted he had previously lied to the police about his whereabouts and knowledge of Reed's disappearance and death in the initial investigation. Police had Reed's body exhumed from his resting place at Schuylkill Memorial Park to have a second autopsy done on January 24 of 2008. The autopsy was done by Dr. Anthony Falsetti, an anthropologist at the University of Florida, who concluded that Reed had actually died of head trauma and noted that his skull was fractured. This matched with Fry's description of Reed hitting his head on the tracks, which would have had enough impact force to fracture Reed's skull. Investigators then began to build a solid case against Joe Geiger. = Geiger's arrest = Joseph \\"Joe\\" Geiger was arrested in his home in Pottsville, Pennsylvania, a town near Schuylkill Haven. Upon arrest, he denied all involvement and instead pinned Fry as the murderer. Police did not believe him. Geiger said, \\"I didn't do it. I didn't admit to nothing.\\" Police say that when they informed Geiger of the charges against him, Geiger began to cry and said that he could not afford a lawyer. Police believe Geiger was abusing methamphetamines at the time of his arrest and subsequently had not slept for days. Police and District Attorney James Goodman would not publicly release details of their evidence against Geiger besides witness testimonies, but did report that Joe Geiger \\"was able to account for all of the known injuries to David Reed before the police or other medical experts were able to determine them.\\" Geiger was held without bail until his trial. He pleaded guilty on all charges, and, as part of a plea agreement, the charges for aggravated assault and third-degree murder were dropped against him. Aggravated assault was amended to simple assault. Geiger was found guilty. Part of his sentence was that he had to pay for the reburial of Reed.  Impact  The case of Reed's mysterious death had rattled the small town of Schuylkill Haven, 75 miles north of Philadelphia, for nearly 24 years. It was the town's largest and most notorious case ever, and was the oldest homicide to be solved. Author Bob Halloran, author of Irish Thunder: The Hard Life & Times of Micky Ward (inspiration for the movie The Fighter), announced in June 2010 that he was planning to write a book about David Reed's death and the subsequent cases.

He studied at the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa, Italy, under the supervision of Luigi Russo, a major critic between the 1930s and the 1960s. After studying philology in Zurich and teaching in Italy for some time, Della Terza moved to Los Angeles, where he started teaching Italian at the University of California Los Angeles. In the early 60's he moved to Harvard University, where he was Professor of Romance Languages and the Irving Babbitt Professor of Comparative Literatures until Fall 1993. His supervision was fundamental for many American scholars in Italian literature. Among his most important students are: William Cole, formerly of Harvard and now of Sitges, Spain; Lucienne Kroha, of McGill University; Manuela Bertone, formerly of Harvard University and now of the Université Nice Sophia Antipolis; Deborah Parker, of the University of Virginia; Anthony Oldcorn, formerly of Brown University; the late Robert Dombroski, of the Graduate Center at the City University of New York; the late Amilcare Jannucci, of the University of Toronto; and Madison Sowell, formerly of Brigham Young University and now Provost at Southern Virginia University. After his time at Harvard, he taught for a few years at the University of Naples \\"Federico II.\\" Dante Della Terza's most important work is focused on Dante Alighieri (he is the founder of the international journal Dante), and on the Italian renaissance (especially Torquato Tasso), but he also wrote extensively on post-World War II Italian literature, culture, and literary criticism. Della Terza is essentially a historicist, but his work often branches into different theoretical perspectives, often addressing the relationship between the text and the reader. Besides literature, Della Terza also wrote about the diaspora of European intellectuals in the United States after World War II. Bibliography * Forma e memoria.

Early years  Beeby was born Beatrice Eleanor Newnham. Her father was a newspaper editor in Timaru, and her mother a schoolteacher. She met Clarence Beeby while they were students at Christchurch Training College. Beeby and Clarence were interested in drama and were foundation members of the Canterbury University College Drama Club. Beeby acted in and directed the drama club's productions. Beeby and Clarence studied Education under James Shelley, a newly arrived lecturer from England, and his ideas influenced them. Beeby passed her teaching examination in 1922 and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from Canterbury College in 1924. Beeby and Clarence were engaged that year, and Clarence moved to Manchester, England to study his doctoral degree. Beatrice did some teaching in Christchurch and followed later on, and they married in Manchester on 3 June 1926. Beeby worked as a teacher of special needs students until she became pregnant and returned to New Zealand. Their first child, Helen, was born in 1927 in Christchurch, six weeks after Clarence returned from England. While raising her young family in Christchurch, Beeby continued her interest in drama and joined the Canterbury Repertory Theatre Society, which Shelley had founded in 1928. She directed and appeared in plays the group produced. In 1932, Clarence and Beeby, together with some of Clarence's university students, set up a free play centre five mornings a week, with the goal of observing the behaviour of 5-year-old children for Clarence's research. In 1934, the family moved to Wellington, where they settled in Karori. Clarence took up a new position at NZCER, the New Zealand Council for Educational Research. Their second child, Christopher, was born in 1935.  Public life  With Joan Wood and Inge Smithells, Beeby established the first nursery playcentres in the early 1940s, precursor to the present-day Playcentre organisation. The aim of the playcentres was to give mothers some relief from single parenting while their husbands were absent fighting in World War II. Two groups were initially established in Karori and Kelburn. On 22 July 1941 the inaugural meeting was held at Wood's home, and the thirteen women who attended agreed to establish a playcentre association. Beeby was elected first President, Wood Recording Secretary and Smithells Organising Secretary. All three women were anxious to be independent but benefited from the connections of their husbands, who were influential in the education field. Clarence, for example, printed the group's pamphlets free of charge at his office. Beeby's knowledge of the funding system also enabled her to successfully apply for a grant from the New Education Fellowship in 1937, and she attended their conference in 1944 as a representative of the nursery playcentre organisation. The ideas of the nursery playcentre proved popular, and by December 1946 playcentres operated in Auckland, Christchurch and Palmerston North. The New Zealand Nursery Play Centre Federation had its first meeting in May 1948. Beeby's life from the 1950s involved accompanying her husband on his international career as a diplomat to France and an educational consultant in the United States and Indonesia. After returning to Wellington, Beeby fell ill and required hospital care for many years. She died in Hutt Hospital on 20 December 1991 of pneumonia.Alcorn, p. 338  References   External links  * Photograph of Beatrice and Clarence Beeby * Photograph of Beatrice and Clarence Beeby and their two children Category:New Zealand educators Category:1903 births Category:1991 deaths Category:People from Timaru Category:University of Canterbury alumni Category:Deaths from pneumonia Category:New Zealand theatre directors Category:New Zealand stage actors Category:New Zealand educational theorists ","title":"Beatrice Beeby"},{"id":"48361800","text":"Cindy Ann Vandenhole (born 1999) is a Belgian artistic gymnast.\\"VANDENHOLE Cindy\\" . database.fig-gymnastics.com.

Early life  Amaya-Bonilla was born in La Ceiba, Honduras, in 1933. Amaya-Bonilla went to the United States in May 1964 from Honduras originally going to Fort Worth, Texas, where she worked as a housekeeper until moving to New York City. She first lived on Longfellow in the Bronx until moving to East New York. She received her American citizenship in 1977. After getting her General Equivalency Diploma, in 1979, Amaya-Bonilla received a B.A. with high honors in Education from Medgar Evers College in New York City. She also has a M.A. and Advanced Certificate in Guidance and Counseling from Brooklyn College.  Career  After moving to New York City, Amaya-Bonilla worked in many different jobs, one of which was with Franciscan friars, who gave her a recommendation that led to a job at World Book Encyclopedia, where she worked for five years. Amaya-Bonilla worked at the NYC Board of Education in various positions as a teacher until eventually working as a guidance counselor. She worked in these positions for over 22 years. Outside of her education and counseling work, Amaya-Bonilla worked with her church, St. Mathews Catholic Church, to provide fundraising and support to her community. Notable relief efforts included the 1974 Hurricane Fifi that hit Honduras and the 1990 Happy Land Fire. In 1991, the Mugama organization created a scholarship fund in honor of a Garifuna who died in the fire. From 1989 until her death, Amaya-Bonilla was a Eucharistic Minister at Lady of Mercy Church in Brooklyn, New York. Amaya-Bonilla helped to organize Committee for Development in Honduras (COPRODH) in the mid-1970s in direct response of helping Hondurans affected by Hurricane Fifi, and Hondurans in the United States. Amaya-Bonilla was a strong supporter of the value of education in helping her community, so she worked to support recent Garifuna immigrants in their effort to learn English and get an education to advance themselves. In January 1989, Amaya-Bonilla, Mirtha Sabio, and Lydia Sacasa-Hill, and others founded an organization called MUGAMA, to recognize the contributions of Garifunan women's accomplishments. The organization was inspired by International Women's Day, in an effort to honor women in the Garifuna community. MUGAMA held conferences and provided recognition within the community, gained non-profit status, and worked to help people get their General Equivalency Diploma and English as a second or foreign language, and U.S. citizenship. The name MUGAMA came from Garifuna Women Marching in Action aka Women on the Move Pro-Education=Mujeres Garifunas en Marcha Pro-Educación, with Garinagu the plural word for Garifuna people. MUGAMA was based out of the Riverdale Osborne Towers in East New York. In 1991, MUGAMA was a sponsor of the First Intercontinental Garifuna Summit Meeting conference that was held at Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn, New York. The event was the first of its kind to bring Garifuna people from the United States together to have a political and cultural exchange of resources and establish a large community gathering.

It operated as the Greenwich Union Infirmary from 1874 to 1929. It was briefly known as the Greenwich and Deptford Hospital before becoming St Alfege's Hospital in 1931. It was then superseded by Greenwich District Hospital in 1968.Details: Greenwich District Hospital, London, The National Archives. Retrieved: 25 October 2015. History =19th century= 1882 map of part of east Greenwich, showing workhouse The hospital developed from an infirmary created for the Greenwich and Deptford workhouse, which opened in 1840 on a site on the east side of Vanbrugh Hill, south of its junction with Woolwich Road; the architect, Robert Palmer Browne (1803-1872), later described his design as \\"plain but cheerful and almslike\\". The Greenwich Union Infirmary opened in 1874, consisting of two 3-storey pavilions (housing 400 patients) and a 4-storey administration and staff accommodation block, built on a 3-acre site south of the workhouse at a cost of £35,000. In 1885 the Board of Guardians raised £14,800 from the Metropolitan Board of Works; two further infirmary blocks were built to house about 300 chronically sick inmates. Two further blocks, housing 250 patients were added in 1889. In 1898 the infirmary was certified as a nurse training school, and was soon also functioning as a general hospital with a staff of 150, including a medical officer and 60 nurses of varying grades. =20th century= During the early 20th century, central heating and electrical lighting were installed, X-ray and massage departments were established, and in 1928 an operating theatre was installed. The following year, administration of the workhouse and infirmary was passed to London County Council and it was renamed the Greenwich and Deptford Hospital; at this date, the workhouse contained 846 beds for the chronic sick and the infirmary 645 beds for acute patients. In 1930 a ward for tuberculosis patients, an out-patients department, pharmacy, antenatal clinic and nurses' sick bay facility were added. In 1931 the Hospital was renamed St Alfege's Hospital, after Alfege, Archbishop of Canterbury, murdered in Greenwich in 1012. In 1934, while working at St Alfege's, Mary Broadfoot Walker first demonstrated the effectiveness of physostigmine in the treatment of the condition myasthenia gravis. In 1948 the Hospital joined the NHS under the control of the South East Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board. In 1960 the Board ended the distinction between the workhouse and infirmary elements of the two St Alfege's Hospitals and merged them into one unit of 605 beds. During the 1960s, demolition of the old workhouse and infirmary and building of a complete new hospital began. Phase 1 was completed in 1969, Phase 2 by the end of 1970 and Phase 3 by 1972. The new three-storey, 800-bed Greenwich District Hospital opened in 1972. The district hospital also replaced the Miller General Hospital in west Greenwich, which finally closed in 1974.

Kanati Clothing Company was formed in July 2009 in Toronto. Kanati Co. quickly gained market traction by becoming a celebrity favorite which led to the company entering a multi-year international distribution arrangement. The company gained notoriety as a pioneer in the fashion industry by creating an Aboriginal influenced premium lifestyle band which had not yet been seen before. \\"Kanati Co.\\" grew to national distribution in the first year in business and it eventually developed into a 14-country distribution network over the next 5 years. The brand was popularized in the U.S by its appearance in numerous music videos from artists like Drag-On of Ruff Ryders Entertainment, Joey Stylez, Meek Mill/Rick Ross, Ja Rule and other popular musicians such as Sean P from the group YoungBloodZ. The label was seen on music group Winnipeg's Most in the Maclean's Magazine \\"Straight Outta Winnipeg\\" feature as well as on CBC Television's Aboriginal series \\"8th Fire\\" hosted by Wab kinew. The company launched its flagship store in Waterloo, Ontario in August, 2014. On-Demand Program In 2014, along with Liam Massaubi, he designed a program for retail fashion designers. The program runs on a pre-qualified membership basis and enables retail labels to meet compliance and expand product lines without the capital investment and need for inventory and minimum orders. The system handles warehousing and distribution for retail labels. The program launch was extremely successful seeing as many as 100 retai-ready labels joining. But unforeseen disruptions arose a couple of months into production in Pakistan relating to flooding, power shortages and political unrest the company to pull all production from the country.

In an article published by The International New York Times, Liam Massaubi was quoted saying \\"Energy issues, transportation issues and continuous supply chain disruptions were creating problems for us.\\"' The events, in part, prompted the Government of Pakistan to respond with a new plan to implement a new textile policy aimed at doubling exports.

Robierb employs a sense of figurativeness to convey overflowing images, filled with hidden meanings, to the viewer. With numerous solo and group art exhibitions, international galleries and art shows, Robierb's artwork is now featured in at least seven countries. His earlier photography work has been recognized with nine honorable mentions at the International Photography Awards (2012).  Early life and education  Rubem Robierb was born in Bacabal, Maranhão, Brazil, a region well known for being the birthplace of many poets. Since a young age, Rubem Robierb began writing poetry, but soon he developed an interest in photography and how images can affect the viewer in an emotional sense. Robierb stated that his work is \\"all about poetry translated into images.\\" At the age twenty years old, he moved to São Paulo with the intention of attending photography school. At that time he began to do commercial photography for the advertising industry.  Career  Robierb work caught the attention of Art et Partage Association, which in 2005 commissioned him his first solo exhibition, Brezil Autrement (Otherwise Brazil) in Aix-en-Provence, France. Subsequently, São Paulo, Zurich, Monaco, Paris and Milan galleries exhibited his photographs. In 2008 Robierb settled in Miami, U.S., attracted by the Latin flair of this city. He opened a studio in Wynwood and began to participate in the artistic atmosphere of Miami, with a constant presence in Art Basel week. He began experimenting with images printed on metallic paper fused with plexiglass with which he achieved highly expressive large formats. In 2009 he took part in Red Dot (Art Basel) with Eros / Thanatos series, a group of images in which the artist researched the thin boundary that exists in human sexuality, between ecstasy and suffering. In 2011 he exhibited Show Me the Money series at Curators Voice Art Gallery in MIAMI, in which he crushed dollar bills and photographed it against a solid black background, creating images which deceive the viewer's perception and question the traditional canons of economic power. The Wynwood atmosphere in the heart of the Miami art district, with its graffiti, vibrant art street and galleries, invited him to turn to his third expressive way, painting. In 2012 Robierb debut in New York City art scene at Emmanuel Freming Gallery with his Bullet- Fly Effect series, a group of photographs in which he performed compositions that fused the body of a butterfly, symbol of beauty, with war materials like bullets or machine guns with a result that dramatically evokes images of transformation, beauty, war and death, while establishes a reference to the ‘butterfly effect’ in the Chaos Theory, where the flapping of a butterfly's wings in New York can create a tsunami in Japan. In 2013 at Taglialatella Gallery in New York City, Robierb made his Bullets & Butterflies show, with the same subject as Bullet Fly Effect series but now, with a series of paintings instead of photographs. In 2015 at 212 Gallery in Aspen, the artist showed his HeArt series of paintings that juxtaposes the symbolic heart with everyday symbols and phrases. In 2015 Robierb was commissioned by the city of Fort Lauderdale to paint Metamorph-Us, a large mural in the downtown area, on the outer walls of The Shade-Post, a multipurpose space for art and design. Robierb was named as one of the featured emerging artists on Art Southampton 2015. On November 4, 2019, Robierb's sculpture Dandara (Dream Machines Series), was unveiled in Tribeca Park, New York City. It was named Dandara after a 42-year-old transgender woman who was brutally attacked and murdered in Fortaleza, Brazil, in 2017. Robierb has participated in group exhibitions such as Corpo Revelado, Blue Life Cultural Space, São Paulo, Brazil (2006), Art Curial for Fight Aids Monaco Foundation, Monaco (2007), Photophantasma, Avant Gallery, Miami (2009), Arteaméricas Art Fair, Canal Gallery, Miami (2012), The Suit, Kasia Kay Art Projects, Chicago (2014), Beautiful Objects , Curator's Voice Art project, Miami (2014), Hot Spot, Curator's Voice Art Projects, Miami (2015), among others.  Personal life  Rubem Robierb and his partner of several years, WABC-TV weather anchor, former Weather Channel figure and former lead meteorologist for Good Morning America Sam Champion, announced their engagement on October 5, 2012, and were married on December 21 of that year. Both of them have been activists for equal marriage, actively support GLAAD and Point Foundation LGBT, among others. On May 3, 2013 Champion, accompanied by Robierb, received the award for Visibility, given for their support of LGBT cause, at the Gala Dinner of Atlanta.

K. Rowling to end the institutionalisation of orphaned children throughout the world, from 2011-2019. Her model of deinstitutionalisation, pioneered since 1993, has been followed in many countries across Eastern and central Europe. Biography Mulheir was born in Oldham in 1968. She has two brothers and a sister. Her father was a carpenter and her mother was a residential social worker. After studying music at Sheffield University, she worked for Sheffield Social Services from 1991 in a mother and baby unit. Since 1993 when she moved to Romania to set up the first mother and baby unit in Bucharest she has pioneered a model of deinstitutionalisation which is now followed in many countries across Central and Eastern Europe. Between 1993 and 2015, the number of children in Romanian orphanages has reduced from 200,000 to 20,000. In 2007 she was appointed operations director of Lumos, becoming chief executive in 2011.

Dyck is best known for her work with live honeybees, that build honeycomb on objects that she introduces to honeybee hives. In 2007 Dyck was awarded both Manitoba's Arts Award of Distinction and Canada's Governor General's Award in Visual and Media Arts. Personal life Dyck was born Aganetha Rempel, in 1937, to Mennonite parents in Marquette, Manitoba, a French-Canadian farming town 50 km north of Winnipeg. She married Peter Dyck, a Mennonite merchant from Winnipeg, in 1958. The family moved to Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, in 1972 where Aganetha Dyck enrolled in art courses. At the Prince Albert Community College Dyck studied pottery, batik, Salish weaving, and art criticism. Dyck began to crochet, and was trained in Salish weaving by a local weaver. While at Prince Albert, Dyck had the opportunity to be mentored by Professor George Glen and studied Art History. The family returned to Winnipeg in 1976. Between 1980 and 1982 Dyck studied Art History at the University of Winnipeg. Together Aganetha and Peter Dyck have three children; Richard, Deborah and Michael. Career Dyck's early work is described as transforming domestic processes into fine art, thereby validating activities that are traditionally considered feminine. In her early work, Dyck used household materials such as buttons, wool fabrics, and cigarettes. Close Knit, completed between 1975 - 1981, took inspiration from a dryer accident with a piece made of wool. Various pieces of wool clothing were then intentionally shrunk for this work. A 1984 Winnipeg Art Gallery exhibition of Dyck's work featured several hundred jars of buttons prepared and cooked using different culinary techniques. Dyck was trained to crochet in the Salish style by a weaver in Prince Albert, Manitoba. After accidentally felting some of her woven work, she began to design felt sculptures, such as Close Knit ((1975‑1981)), Skirt Issue (1981) and Forest (1975‑1981), as well as sculptures that combined felt art with found objects, such as 23 Suitcases (1981). Dyck is best known for her work with honeybees, which began in 1989 when she rented beehives, and is described by her as a collaboration. She was inspired when she came across a store sign made out of honeycomb. Dyck places objects into beehives, or beehives into objects, and allows insects to build honeycomb on the objects, sometimes over the course of years. This work is considered to be exemplified by Glass Dress: Lady in Waiting (1992‑1998), currently held at the National Gallery of Canada. The work took 10 beekeeping seasons to create. Another collaboration with bees is Hockey Night in Canada (1995 - 2000) where various pieces of sports equipment are turned into beehives. (Her work with honeybees has drawn attention from the press, and Dyck has been featured in the CBC television show The Nature of Things, with David Suzuki. Dyck has collaborated with beekeepers and entomologists in making her sculptures. In addition to appreciating the beauty of the honeycomb, Dyck hopes that \\"people will realize the importance of the honeybees' work.\\" Even as Dyck began her artistic practice by referencing the domestic objects and tasks with which she was most familiar, she continued to employ traditional signifiers of womanhood through the collaborative creation of honey-comb encrusted high heels, handbags, and even a wedding gown. Dyck's work with bees has been featured in Troyes, Paris, Rotterdam, and at the Yorkshire Sculpture Park in England. A selection of her awards includes the Manitoba Arts Council Award of Distinction (2007), Governor General\`s Award in Visual and Media Arts (2007), Winnipeg's Art City Star Award (2013), Winnipeg Art Council's Making a Mark Award (2014). Dyck's show \\"Collaborations\\" was featured at Burnaby Art Gallery 2009 In 2018, Close Knit was included in Thunderstruck: Physical Landscapes, a Canada Council exhibition about contemporary dance.

During his episcopate, the city of León declined in importance relative to the city of Toledo. Peter had to contend with the claim of the archbishops of Toledo that the diocese of León lay within their province, a claim approved by Pope Urban II in 1099. In 1104, Peter successfully convinced Urban's successor, Paschal II, to grant León an exemption from metropolitan control on the basis of a forged document, the so- called Division of Wamba. Significantly, the dioceses of León and Oviedo had common interests at this time. The only copies of the Division that support the Leonese claims emanate from the scriptorium of the cathedral of Oviedo under Bishop Pelagius, a notorious forger. The original of the papal bull of exemption still survives in the cathedral of León. When Duke Raymond of Galicia died on 20 September 1107 in his castle of Grajal in the diocese of León, Bishop Peter gave permission for his body to be brought back to Santiago de Compostela for burial. Peter was present at the marriage of Queen Urraca of León and King Alfonso I of Aragon in Monzón in October 1109, for he witnessed the queen's grant of a fuero to the men of the land of León and Carrión on 29 September, while she was on her way to meet her groom. He was with the royal court at Sahagún when it celebrated Christmas that year, for he signed a private document there on 21 December. Civil war broke out in the new year between the partisans of Urraca and those of Alfonso. After receiving a papal letter condemning her marriage on grounds of consanguinity, the queen sought the advice of some bishops, Peter among them. They advised her to separate from her husband. After the king of Aragon's victory in the battle of Candespina on 26 October 1111, Peter's advice to Urraca cost him his see; the partisans of Alfonso had him removed from office. The diocese was briefly usurped by Archbishop Maurice of Braga, before Peter's nephew Diego was elected bishop. Peter himself went into exile in Galicia, where he was still alive as of 13 June 1112.

She remained there for two years before bringing him back to Paris. At the age of fifteen, having noticed his artistic talent, his father enrolled him at the Académie Julian, where he studied with Jules Joseph Lefebvre, Gustave Boulanger and Jean-Joseph Benjamin- Constant.Brief biography @ the Commune de Saint-Ambreuil website. (Note: The portrait is not Déchenaud.) In 1885, he competed for entry to the École des Beaux-arts, but was obliged to perform military service in 1886. After a year with the 13th Infantry Regiment in Nevers, he returned to the Académie. He achieved second-place in the Prix de Rome competition in 1891 for his depiction of Philemon and Baucis. Three years later, he shared the Grand Prize with Auguste Leroux for his version of Judith beheading Holofernes. That same year, he went to the Villa Médicis and remained there until 1898. During this time, he painted the portraits of several of his fellow residents who would later become well-known, including André Devambez, François-Léon Sicard and Emmanuel Pontremoli. His first exhibition at the Salon was in 1899. He only received an honorable mention, but this was followed by medals in 1900 and 1901. At the Salon of 1913, he received the Medal of Honor. He also became a teacher at the Académie. In 1914, at the beginning of World War I, he produced one of his most familiar paintings; Le comité des forges (the Foundry Committee), a tableau of the twenty-five most powerful French industrialists. After the war, he was elected a to succeed Raphaël Collin in Seat#11 at the Académie des Beaux-Arts. Upon his death, he was succeeded by Lucien Simon.

It is widely used for sports fields for being more hard-wearing and resistant than natural surfaces. Most use infills of crumb rubber from recycled tires, which use is controversial because of concerns that the tires contain carcinogens. Studies An unpublished study by Rutgers University examined crumb rubber from synthetic fields in New York City. It found six possibly carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons at levels excessive to state regulations. The researchers warned that the findings could have been made inaccurate by solvent extraction used to release the chemicals from the rubber. In a statistical study of the list of soccer players with cancer provided by UW coach Amy Griffin, public health researchers for the State of Washington found that the rates of cancer were actually lower than was estimated for the general population. While they did not state any conclusions on the safety of this form of artificial turf, they did recommend that players not restrict their play due to the presumed health benefits of being active. In 2007, the California Office of Environmental Health Assessment (OEHHA) simulated interactions children can have with after coming into direct contact with artificial turf. Results showed that five chemicals, including four polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), were found in samples. One of these compounds, chrysene, was present at levels higher than the standard established by OEHHA. Chrysene is a known carcinogen, meaning it can increase the risk of a child developing cancer. In late 2015, the United States Congress' House Energy and Commerce Committee ordered for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to investigate a link. EPA, the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are investigating. A 2019 Yale study showed that there were 306 chemicals in crumb rubber. 52 of these chemicals were classified as carcinogens by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). They concluded that their findings highlight \\"a vacuum in our knowledge about the carcinogenic properties of many crumb rubber infill. The crumb rubber infill of artificial turf fields contains or emits chemicals that can affect human physiology.\\" Testimonies Nigel Maguire, formerly a chief executive for the National Health Service in Cumbria, claims that his son, a goalkeeper, could have developed Hodgkin's lymphoma by playing on an artificial surface. He has called for a ban on the surfaces, saying \\"It is obscene so little research has been done.\\" In 2014, Amy Griffin, soccer coach at the University of Washington, surveyed American players of the sport who had developed cancer. Of 38 players, 34 were goalkeepers, a position in which diving to the surface makes accidental ingestion or blood contact with crumb rubber more likely, Griffin has asserted. Lymphoma and leukemia, cancers of the blood, predominated. Sports organizations FIFA, the world governing body of association football (soccer), has stated that the evidence weighs in favour of artificial pitches being safe. The Football Association of England stated in February 2016 that they were observing reports and conducting their own research on the issue.

Historical context  In 1868, the United States and China entered into the Burlingame Treaty, establishing formal friendly relations between the two countries, and granting China most favored nation status. The treaty encouraged immigration from China, and granted some privileges to citizens of either country residing in the other, but withheld the privilege of naturalization for immigrants from China. During the 1870s, there were repeated efforts in the United States Congress to limit Chinese immigration to the United States. One successful effort in this direction was the Page Act of 1875, that forbade the migration of women believed to be inclined to engaging in prostitution and anybody coming to the United States as a forced laborer. The Act did not significantly curtail the flow of mostly male free Chinese laborers. = Fifteen Passenger Bill = The first bill to significantly curtail Chinese migration that passed both houses of Congress was the Fifteen Passenger Bill of 1879. The bill forbade sea vessels from bringing in more than fifteen Chinese passengers in any single voyage to the United States. Ship masters were required to present a sworn list of all Chinese passengers upon arrival, and violators could be fined $100 and six months in prison. However, Rutherford B. Hayes, President of the United States at the time, vetoed the bill because it violated the terms of the Burlingame Treaty. Expressing sympathy with the aims of the bill, he suggested that the treaty be modified in agreement with China. = Angell commission = Hayes sent a commission led by James Burrill Angell to China to negotiate a new treaty to allow restrictions on Chinese immigration. John F. Swift and William H. Trescot went along with Angell also as commissioners. The party of commissioners landed in China in early August 1880. On November 17, 1880, the new treaty was signed in Peking (now Beijing). According to the new treaty, the United States government would temporarily suspend immigration of skilled and unskilled laborers from China, while still allowing the immigration of white-collar professionals. The treaty also reaffirmed the United States' continuing commitment to protect the rights and privileges of Chinese laborers already present in the United States. The prefix stated: \\"The United States, because of the constantly increasing immigration of Chinese labourers to the territory of the United States and the embarrassments consequent upon such immigration now desires to negotiate a modification of the existing Treaties which shall not be in direct contravention to their spirit.\\" The treaty was concluded along with another treaty, also negotiated by the Angell commission, that imposed restrictions on trade in opium. = Conclusion, ratification, and proclamation = President James Garfield’s order to Secretary of State to approve the treaty The dates for establishing the treaty were: * Conclusion in Beijing: November 17, 1880 * Ratification advised by the United States Senate: May 5, 1881 * Ratification by the United States President: May 9, 1881 * Ratification exchange: July 19, 1881 * Proclamation: October 5, 1881  Subsequent changes  The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 (passed May 6, 1882), passed unilaterally by the United States, extended the exclusion period for Chinese laborers by another 10 years. An 1884 Amendment to the Act required Chinese laborers departing the United States to get a re-entry permit if they wished to re-enter. Later, the Scott Act would forbid the return of Chinese laborers who had departed the United States. The Geary Act of 1892 extended Chinese exclusion by another ten years, and in 1902 it would be made permanent. Two cases that appeared before the United States Supreme Court in the 1880s referenced the Angell Treaty: * Chew Heong v. United States (1884): Heong, who had departed the United States for China prior to the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act, did not have the re-entry permit mandated by an 1884 Amendment to the Act. Heong would have been able to re-enter under the legal regime as it existed at the time of departure, which was shaped by the Burlingame Treaty and the Angell Treaty. When denied re-entry into the United States, he contested the decision. The Supreme Court decided in his favor. * Chae Chan Ping v. United States (1889): Ping, who had departed the United States prior to the Scott Act, had obtained a re-entry permit as required by the Chinese Exclusion Act. However, upon his return after the passage of the Scott Act, he was denied re-entry. He contested the decision, citing the Burlingame Treaty and Angell Treaty, but the Supreme Court sided with the government.

History Around 1898 the company became responsible for the ships of Shell Transport and Trading In 1907 Continued to be responsible for the trade in oil by-products when the Dutch Petroleum Company was established to take over the petroleum business of the Dutch state authorities and the Shell company. The same year it was incorporated into Royal Dutch Shell. In 1908 Shell Transport and Trading had placed all of its assets in Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Co and Bataafsche Petroleum Maatschappij which also held all of the assets of Royal Dutch Shell Since then the company owned and ran the oil transport and storage activities of the Shell group of companies. During the following two decades Anglo-Saxon became the most progressive, innovative and forward-looking of all the oil carriers. In order to match transport demand, they commissioned new buildings based on their own design or, indeed, bought and re-designed existing ships with an amazing degree of innovative thinking and fantasy. Liner ships, general cargo vessels, sailing ships and even train ferries were re-built and made into oil carriers.

The orchestra, formerly known as the Beaumont Symphony Orchestra, officially started in 1953; however, the impetus can be traced back as early as 1923 with the formation of the Beaumont Music Commission. The 2019-20 season is the sixty-seventh consecutive season since the founding year. The symphony's home theater is the Julie Rogers Theater in downtown Beaumont. The symphony lists over eighty musicians in the orchestra as of 2015. The typical season includes four classical concerts and a pops concert. A separate Holiday concert is offered. In addition, the symphony makes several free appearances. A typical season includes four youth concerts, two \\"side–by–side\\" concerts, and a concert included in the city of Beaumont's annual July 4th celebration in downtown Beaumont. Student and professional musicians perform together in the side–by–side concerts. The symphony is supported by the Symphony League of Beaumont, formerly known as the Beaumont Symphony Women's League. The league was organized in 1955. It provides financial support as well as services. Other support is provided by corporate and foundation underwriting as well as concert admission fees. History Several well known and popular artists have performed with the symphony over the years. Examples of some of the performers include Al Hirt, Andre Previn, Van Cliburn, and Isaac Stern. The symphony has been led by several conductors over its history. *Jay Dietzer (1953–1957) *:de:Edvard Fendler (1953–1970) *Joseph B. Carlucci (1971–1990) *Diane M.

Violent crime, political instability, poor infrastructure, discriminatory laws, and unskilled labor are obstacles to this happening, as well as the fact that the country is closer, culturally and geographically, to the Pacific islands to its east and that it is historically and financially tied more closely to Australia in the south. PNG was not directly administered by the Indonesian, Spanish, Portuguese, British, Dutch, French or American governments that controlled the colonies of Southeast Asia (with the exception of Thailand). PNG was partially under German control, then later administered by Australia (with a very brief stint under British control) until its independence. As early as 1987, PNG's membership in the South Pacific Forum was viewed as an obstacle to its joining ASEAN. In 2009, the country asked for the support of the Philippines in its ASEAN bid, however, no official response was heard as it was the election season during that time. The incumbent conservative Filipino administration which PNG contacted and supported dramatically lost to a more liberal administration in the 2010 Philippine elections.http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/154860/papua-new-guinea- asks-rp-support-for-asean-membership-bid/story/ Currently, Indonesia is the only ASEAN member supporting Papua New Guinea's membership. A grassroots level of support exists in the Philippines, although there is caution due to PNG's discriminatory policies on human rights, notably on LGBT rights and the issue of West Papua. Singapore, Malaysia, and Brunei have shown dissatisfaction over PNG's economic status which has hindered its acceptance in ASEAN. Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia have shown displeasure towards anti-LGBT laws in PNG, as well as PNG's lack of action over the issue of West Papua. Laos and Myanmar have no official position in regards to PNG's ASEAN application. Papua New Guinea has enjoyed observer status in ASEAN since 1976. Benefits PNG has cited to ASEAN members from PNG's accession might include tapping into Papua New Guinea's lead industries such as oil and gas, mining and seafood.

Williams played for a winless 1946 Florida team that compiled an 0–9 record, catching 29 passes for 490 yards in eight games.

He also posted a then-school record 9 receptions in the 13-27 loss to Tulane. He was selected by the United Press as a first-team end on the 1946 All-SEC football team. Dr. John J. Tigert called Williams \\"one of the finest pass receivers I've ever seen.\\" In March 1947, Williams gave up his final two years of college eligibility and signed a contract to play professional football for the Chicago Bears, who selected him in the 1945 NFL Draft.

Shields and her work have appeared on broadcasts and publications including TED, Infants on Thrones, and TechInsider. Shields was born in Provo, Utah to Heidi and Eric Shields and raised in a conservative Mormon family in Tooele, Utah and Gresham, Oregon. She graduated from Orem High School (Orem, Utah) in 2000, Brigham Young University (Provo, Utah) in 2004 with a degree in Anthropology and African Studies, and Boston University in 2017 with dual PhDs in Biological Anthropology and Cultural Anthropology. Shields lives in Salt Lake City with her husband, Brent Stewart, and three children.  Professional life  = Placebo studies = As a placebo studies expert, Shields examines the scientific/biological basis of the placebo response in humans including the implications and effects of ritual (including medical rituals, social rituals, and religious rituals), the subject-healer relationship, cultural context, and the efficacy of belief, faith, imagination, trust and hope in physical and emotional healing processes. Shields' doctoral dissertation, \\"The Social Life of Placebos: Proximate and Evolutionary Mechanisms of Biocultural Interactions in Asante Medical Encounters\\" is an interdisciplinary study of the evolution of placebogenic responses–beneficial ones activated by psychosocial triggers–and their elicitation in Asante medical contexts. Based on extensive literature review in social, cultural, and medical studies over 26 months of intensive research in rural Ghana, West Africa, it examines the therapeutic efficacy of Asante medical encounters by analyzing rites of caregiving within an evolutionary framework. = Social susceptibility = Much of Shields' academic work focuses on the concept of social susceptibility or why human bodies have evolved to be susceptible to social manipulation. Shields argued that grounding human behavior in social adaptations and viewing biocultural interactions in sickness and healing from an evolutionary perspective reveals important discoveries in placebo and ritual studies, religion, pain, stress, emotions, empathy, and social inequality. Shields spoke about how these sociocultural, biological and evolutionary concepts clash at the 2013 TED Fellows Retreat in Whistler, British Columbia, Canada, where she used an Asante ethnographic case study of bonesetting to elucidate socially mediating pain mechanisms. = Strategic consulting = Shields regularly consults with commercial and professional organizations in the areas of ethnographic research, brand strategy, learning strategy, content strategy, business strategy, audience segmentation, persona development, collaborative workshop planning and facilitation, and user experience. She also assists executives in the creation and delivery of high-profile talks, presentations, and lectures - both on and off camera. = Religious gender inequality = Shields is also known for her activism to combat religious gender inequality. Shields gave a TED Talk on the topic of Religious Gender Inequality at the TED Fellows Retreat in September 2015 eventually entitled, \\"How I'm Working for Change Inside My Church.\\" She is also a contributor featured in Mormon Feminism: Essential Writings. Shields was president and co-founder of Mormons for ERA, a group dedicated to the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment. She was a co- founder and former board member for Ordain Women, a group dedicated to creating increased access to administrative and ecclesiastical decision-making capacities for women in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints through the ordination of women to the Aaronic and Melchizedek Priesthoods. She is also on the board of the Sunstone Education Foundation, an organization that discusses Mormonism through scholarship, art, short fiction, and poetry.

He performed country music as Jimmie (or Jimmy) Logsdon, and rockabilly music, including his best-known song \\"I Got a Rocket in My Pocket,\\" as Jimmy Lloyd. Life and career Logsdon was born in Panther, Kentucky, the son of a Methodist minister. He and his sister sang in choirs and took part in local talent contests, and he grew up listening to rhythm and blues as well as country music. He graduated from high school in Ludlow, Kentucky, in 1940, and married the same year, before starting work installing PA systems in nearby Cincinnati. He joined the Air Corps in 1944, and on leaving two years later opened a record and radio shop in La Grange, Kentucky. He learned the guitar, and began writing songs, performing regularly on radio station WLOU and in clubs as leader of a country trio. He made his first recordings for the local Harvest label in Cincinnati in 1951, and the following year joined station WKYW as senior announcer. He continued performing, and at a show in Louisville met his hero Hank Williams, who encouraged him to seek a recording deal. Obituary of Jimmy Logsdon, The Courier-Journal, October 8, 2001. Retrieved October 25, 2015. Biography by Sandra Brennan, Allmusic.com. Retrieved October 25, 2015. Rusty York, \\"Jimmy Logsdon\\", Rockabilly Hall of Fame. Retrieved October 25, 2015. He made his first recordings for Decca Records in Nashville, including \\"I Wanna Be Mama'd\\", in October 1952. Following Williams' death three months later, Logsdon recorded a tribute to him, \\"Hank Williams Sings the Blues No More\\", but it failed to reach the country charts. Later in 1953, Logsdon joined station WHAS-TV, and hosted and performed, with his band the Golden Harvest Boys, on its country music show. He continued to record for Decca, but his records had little success and he left the label in 1955. He also recorded for the Starday and Dot labels. He maintained a radio show on station WKLO, and interviewed many leading country performers, as well as Elvis Presley. In 1957 he recorded a rockabilly song, \\"Rio de Rosa\\", which he had co-written with Vic McAlpin, for Roulette Records. It failed to sell, but the song was quickly covered by Carl Perkins. For his next recording for Roulette, \\"I Got a Rocket in My Pocket\\", also co-written with McAlpin, he used the pseudonym Jimmy Lloyd, recognising that country fans did not appreciate him singing rock and roll, particularly a song with lyrics of which some disapproved. Few listeners realised at the time that the recording was by Logsdon. After leaving Roulette, Logsdon continued working as a DJ, at WCKY in Cincinnati, and appeared on national radio shows. He made some further recordings for King Records in Cincinnati in 1963, before moving to work for other radio stations in Kentucky and Alabama later in the 1960s. He also wrote songs for Johnny Horton and others. He made no recordings after 1973, but sang occasionally in clubs, and worked for a swimming pool business and in the Kentucky Labor Department. He died in Louisville in 2001, aged 79.

She is best known for the three buildings of the Antorchas Foundation in Buenos Aires and for the part she played the development of the National Library in Buenos Aires. In 1985 she completed the first Antorchas building. Writer Roberto Segren notes how in her work on the first Antorchas building transformed a \\"decayed palace representative of the anonymous architecture of Italian builders of the late nineteenth century\\" in the San Telmo neighborhood. Biography From 1952 to 1958, she studied at the Faculty of Architecture and Urbanism at the University of Buenos Aires, together with Beatriz Goldestein, Nely Cueitel and Nora Monreal. It was during the period of transition when some of the staff were teaching the Beaux Arts style while others were beginning to turn to Modernism, especially César Janello and Tomás Maldonado who taught integral design. She was also able to benefit from the lectures given by Odilia Suárez and Enriqueta Méoli, both bent on following emerging trends. She was on the point of leaving Buenos Aires to embark on further studies in Rosario where there was a new school of architecture but she stayed in the capital after meeting Gerardo Clusellas (1929–73) who became her business partner, her husband and the father of her three sons. From 1957, she began her career at the university, working under Janello and with Wladimiro Acosta. From 1963 to 1966, she headed first-year practical projects in Alfredo Ibarlucía's department. Later she worked with Mario Tempone. With the return of democracy in 1984, she returned to the Faculty of Architecture at Buenos Aires University as lecturer responsible for cultural events until 1889 when she was worked for the dean, undertaking research and arranging historical exhibitions. Between 1998 and 2002, Levisman was Director of ARCA, Argentina's architectural archive centre (Asociación Civil para el Archivo de Arquitectura Contemporánea Argentina); she also served as ARCA's president. As an archivist she has worked for the Bustillo family. Levisman has conducted research as a historian into architecture, in one instance arguing that the \\"Bariloche style\\" was \\"created by a group of affluent Argentine developers inspired by 'colonization, illusion and fantasy'\\". As an architect, she was a member of her husband's firm. The most important completed works included the Antorchas Head Office (1985), the TAREA Foundation building (renovated in 1987) and an addition to the Antorchas complex to house a photograph gallery, completed in 1991. In 1989, she was commissioned to complete work on the National Library, a sizeable project which entailed redrafting plans for the interiors which had been mislaid.

First established in 1627 by Tōdō Takatora and renovated in 1651 by Tokugawa Iemitsu, the shrine has remained mostly intact since that time, making it a great example of Shinto architecture in the Edo period. Several of those surviving structures have been designated Important Cultural Properties. Tōshō-gū shrines are characterized by enshrining Tokugawa Ieyasu with the name Tōshō Daigongen (東照大権現). Ueno Tōshō-gū also enshrines two other Tokugawa shōguns, Tokugawa Yoshimune and Tokugawa Yoshinobu. Located inside of Ueno Park, Ueno Tōshō-gū has become a popular attraction.  History  Ueno Tōshō- gū ca. 1920 Ueno Tōshō-gū is said to have been built in 1627, by Tōdō Takatora. It is known that in 1627 it was dedicated to the memory of Tokugawa Ieyasu (1542–1616), the founder and first shōgun of the Tokugawa shogunate of Japan, which effectively ruled Japan from the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600 until the Meiji Restoration in 1868. In 1651 the honden of the shrine was rebuilt in the gongen-zukuri style by Tokugawa Iemitsu (1604–1651), grandson of Ieyasu and the third Tokugawa shōgun. Until 1868, the shrine was part of the Tendai Buddhist temple Kan'ei-ji. Unlike much of the buildings in the surrounding area, Ueno Tōshō-gū has remained intact throughout the many earthquakes, fires and wars, including the Battle of Ueno in 1868 and the Great Kantō earthquake in 1923. Tokugawa Yoshimune (1684–1751) and Tokugawa Yoshinobu (1837–1913) are also enshrined in Ueno Tōshō-gū.  Architecture  = Karamon = A is a type of mon in Japanese architecture characterized by the use of , a type of curved gable with a style peculiar to Japan.

It was developed by Nice Architects, a firm based in Bratislava, Slovakia. Shaped like an egg to minimize its surface-area-to-volume ratio, its walls are made of two layers of fiberglass with polyurethane foam sandwiched in between. Nice Architects describes the Ecocapsule as a \\"low-energy house packed into a compact form\\", although other potential applications include as a disaster-relief shelter, a scientific research station, and even as a \\"remote Airbnb\\".  Dimensions  Weighing and measuring in length by in width by in height, the Ecocapsule is designed to accommodate two occupants. In addition to providing sleeping quarters for two with a folding bed, it also includes a kitchenette, a shower, a fold-out table, working windows, and even storage space. The Ecocapsule's interior, described by Devin Coldewey as \\"futuristic but warm\\", is bathed in natural light and predominantly white in color with blond wood accents.  Environmental impact  The Ecocapsule is powered primarily by a built-in, wind turbine and secondarily by a high-efficiency, solar cell array. It is designed to produce more energy than it consumes, as long as the external temperature remains between and . The dwelling is also equipped with a battery that can hold four days worth of electrical charge. If the battery is charged, the Ecocapsule diverts some of the energy captured by the solar cells to supplement its water heater. Other energy-conservation features of the dwelling are its high-efficiency climate control system and a heat exchanger that uses exhaust air to warm fresh incoming air. The Ecocapsule also harnesses rainwater with its reservoir, which is located beneath the dwelling's floor. The water is cleaned via a pre-filtration system and two UV LED lamps. Drinking water is also provided by filters installed on the faucets. The Ecocapsule also features a waterless separating toilet. The Ecocapsule has a central computer that monitors its electricity and water levels, and can be controlled via a mobile app. The app is also used for controlling all important aspects of Ecocapsule. According to Nice Architects, the Ecocapsule should allow its occupants to live off the grid for several weeks to several months.  Launching  On May 28, 2015, the Ecocapsule was publicly unveiled at Vienna's Pioneers Festival after six years of development. By July 2015, thousands of pre-orders had already been made and interest generated among celebrities such as Susan Sarandon. In January 2018, the company Ecocapsule launched the production of the First Series Ecocapsules, limited to 50 pieces. They have also announced the production of the more affordable, mass-produced Second Series Ecocapsules, with the planned launch in the second half of 2019. The price of a First Series Ecocapsule is €79,900. The price of the Second Series Ecocapsules is to be announced in 2019. The shipping costs from Slovakia to New York City are around 3,000 euros (about US$3,500), and to Melbourne around 2,500 euros (about AU$4,000). In addition to being shipped, the dwelling is also designed to be transported by airlifting and towing.

Lyseng Church is an expansion of the former Eastern Chapel () which had sat unused on the site for 40 years. Holme and Skåde Parish are two of the largest parishes in the Diocese of Aarhus, each with some 11.000 parish members, and the diocese planned to split the parishes. The parish councils objected to the plan and instead suggested the creation of a third church in order to lessen the burden on the existing churches. The decision was made in 2007 in a joint agreement between the two parishes and the diocese and the restoration was completed in 2010 with the first sermon being held in February of that year. The original chapel was constructed in 1913 in Romanesque style, with a base of natural stone and a superstructure of brick. The chapel was built between the villages of Holme and Skåde to serve a joint cemetery. In 1951 the chapel was made redundant when Holme Church got its own cemetery and services at the chapel was reduced until it was eventually closed down entirely.

Alam was targeted for murder by the Sipah-e-Muhammad Pakistan (SMP) to provoke sectarian violence in Pakistan as he was from the Deobandi movement and to receive the widespread news coverage that a journalist typically receives when killed. At least four others were killed in the same terrorist operation.  Aftab Alam Aftab Alam was born around 1970. He lived with his extended family in the 11-C area of North Karachi, which is close to the Sir Syed market. On the day of his murder, he was arriving home from picking up his children from school. After the attack he died on the way to the hospital. He was 44 years old at the time of his murder. Alam began his career with Geo TV, where he produced business news. He later joined Samaa TV as an assignment editor. In addition to his journalism, he worked at the Karachi Stock Exchange and was engaged in real estate. Unemployed at time of his death.  Attacks  The attack on Aftab Alam was carried out by Sipah-e-Muhammad Pakistan's Manzar Imam group, which is a Shiite terrorist group operating in Pakistan and Indian. Alam's name was on the group's hit list of members of the Deobandi movement. The murders of Alam and others targeted by the group were timed to take place before the month of Muharram, which for the SMP is full of religious significance. Pakistani counter-terrorism in Karachi was bracing for further violence from Lashkar-e- Jhangvi, Sipah-e-Muhammad Pakistan (SMP), Mehdi Force, affiliates of the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, Jundullah, and al-Qaeda and reported that 86 people had been killed in 2015 from sectarian violence. Aftab Alam was murdered the day after Geo TV's satellite technician Arshad Ali Jaffery, also transliterated as Jafri or Jaffari, was killed. At least four other journalists were killed in Pakistan in 2015. Around the same time frame as Jaffery and Alam, another journalist, Abdul Azam, was shot three times in Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan, which is close to the Afghanistan border.The Karachi Press Club is active after the death of two journalists over two days. The Counter Terrorism Department arrested four suspects in the case, including Syed Zeeshan Haider Zaidi (known as Zeeshan Haider), who they say confessed to the crime, acted as mastermind, and was trained in Iran. Police fingered Zaidi as the leader of one of three teams and shooter and Adeel Raza as the driver of the motorcycle. According to the scenario sketched by police, the two pulled up on a motorcycle as Aftab was outside his home and Haider is believed to have shot him in the head. Alam took two bullets to his head and one other to his neck. The CTD spokesperson pointed to suspect Shah Gee, also transliterated as Ji, as the supplier of the 0.9mm pistol. Another team was led by Salman, also transliterated as Suleman. The same group from SMP was also held responsible by the CTD for killing two other men at a bakery in Nazimabad (5-B-1 area) of Karachi. The two men were also from the Deobandi sect. Another group was responsible for an attack that killed two at Rasheed Qaurma Hotel, also in Nazimabad. The main motive of the terrorists was to stoke sectarian violence by targeting members of the Deobandi sect. The arrests were carried out between September 11 and 14 with Haider's arrest followed by the others implicated. A weapon and mobile phones were confiscated from the search and arrest.

R. Oppenheimer pg.76) was a car bomb attack carried out by the Provisional IRA (IRA) which took place outside the Old Bailey Courthouse on 8 March 1973. The attack was carried out by an 11-person active service unit (ASU) from the Provisional IRA Belfast Brigade. The unit also exploded a second bomb which went off outside the Ministry of Agriculture near Whitehall in London at around the same time the bomb at the Old Bailey went off. This was the Provisional IRA's first major attack in England since the Troubles began in the late 1960s. One British civilian died of a heart attack attributed to the bombing, estimates of the injured range from 180–220 from the two bombings. Two additional bombs were found and defused. Nine people from Belfast were convicted six months later for the bombing, one person managed to escape and one was acquitted for providing information to the police. Background The Troubles had been ongoing in Northern Ireland and to a lesser extent in the Republic of Ireland since the late 1960s. Rioting, protests, gun battles, sniper attacks, bombings and punishment beatings became part of everyday life in many places in Northern Ireland, especially in the poorer working class areas of Belfast and Derry. These events and others helped to heighten sectarianism and boosted recruitment into Irish republican and Ulster loyalist paramilitary groups and the security forces; mainly the newly created Ulster Defence Regiment. England had been relatively untouched from the violence up until the beginning of 1973, but the IRA Army Council had drawn up plans for a bombing campaign to take place in England some time early in 1973. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, loyalist paramilitaries had bombed Dublin and other parts of the Republic of Ireland a number of times before the IRA began its bombing campaign in England. These early loyalist bombings were carried out by the Ulster Volunteer Force and were small bombs aimed at destruction only, not injuring or killing anybody. Following the Dublin bombings in late 1972 and in January 1973 carried out by Loyalists which killed three people and injured over 150, the media attention these bombings received helped the Provisional IRA decide to take its campaign to Britain in return. Another reason the IRA brought their campaign to England Billy McKee explained to journalist Peter Taylor was that the IRA had decided to bomb England early if there was an emergency in the IRA and it began to weaken in Ireland. The arrest of top Provisionals in both the Republic and Northern Ireland like Máire Drumm, Seán Mac Stíofáin, Ruairí Ó Brádaigh and Martin McGuinness in late 1972 November 1972 CAINDecember 1972 CAIN helped to convince the IRA to bomb England to take the heat off of the IRA in Ireland.Peter Taylor Behind The Mask: The IRA and Sinn Fein, p.179,181 The IRA selected the volunteers who would constitute the ASU for the England bombing operation, which was scheduled to take place on 8 March 1973, the same day that a border poll – boycotted by Nationalists and Roman Catholics – was being held in Belfast. Volunteers from all three of the IRA's Belfast Brigade Battalions were selected for the bombing mission, the team included 19-year-old Gerry Kelly, 24-year-old Robert \\"Roy\\" Walsh (an expert bomb maker from Belfast), Hugh Feeney (a Belfast-born IRA volunteer & explosives expert), and two sisters, Marian, 19, and Dolours Price, 22, from Belfast who were from a staunchly Republican family, along with five other lesser-known volunteers from Belfast: Martin Brady, 22, William Armstrong, 29, Paul Holmes, 19, William McLarnon, 19, and Roisin McNearney, 18. Bombing Several days before the bombing, the leaders of the Provisional Irish Republican Army ASU, which included sisters Marian and Dolours Price, went to London and picked out four targets: the Old Bailey, the Ministry of Agriculture, an army recruitment office near Whitehall, and New Scotland Yard. They then reported back to their Officer Commanding in Belfast, and the IRA Army Council gave the go ahead. The bombs were made in Ireland and transported to London via ferry, according to Marian Price. The Royal Ulster Constabulary warned the British that the ASU was travelling to England, but were unable to provide specifics as to the target. The drivers and the volunteers who were to prime the bombs woke up at 6:00 a.m. and drove the car bombs to their various targets. Gerry Kelly and Roy Walsh drove their car bomb to the Old Bailey. It was planned that by the time the bombs went off at around 15:00, the active service unit would be back in Ireland. The bomb at New Scotland Yard was found at 8:30 by a policeman who noticed a discrepancy in the licence plate. The bomb team started lifting out 5-pound bags of explosives and separated them, so that if the bomb did go off, the force of the explosion would be greatly reduced. The bomb squad eventually found the detonating cord leads, which ran under the front passenger seat of the car; Peter Gurney, a senior member of New Scotland Yard, cut the detonator cord leads, defusing the bomb. However, at the Old Bailey the bomb exploded, injuring many and causing extensive damage. Scotland Yard stated it had warned the City of London police at 14:01 to search near the Old Bailey for a green Ford Cortina; the car was not located until 14:35 and exploded at 14:49 while police were evacuating the area. A shard of glass from the explosion is preserved as a reminder, embedded in the wall at the top of the main stairs. Several more people were injured by the car bomb near the Ministry of Agriculture, which brought the total number injured to over 200. A British man, 60-year-old Frederick Milton, died of a heart attack. Dolours Price wrote in her memoir: \\"There were warnings phoned in but people had stood about, curious to see... If people ignored the warnings and stood around gawking, they were stupid. The numbers of injured came about through curiosity and stupidity.\\" The ASU was caught trying to leave the country at Heathrow Airport prior to the explosions, as the police had been forewarned about the bombings and were checking all passengers to Belfast and Dublin. All 10 gave false names that did not match their documents. Court and sentence The IRA volunteers had to be tried at Winchester Crown court as the Old Bailey was wrecked by the car bomb there. The trial took 10 weeks and was set amid extremely strict security. William McLarnon pleaded guilty to all charges on the first day of the trial. On 14 November 1973, a jury convicted six men and two women of the bombings. The jury acquitted Roisin McNearney in exchange for information, and she was given a new identity. As her verdict was handed down, the other defendants began to hum the \\"Dead March\\" from Saul, and one threw a coin at her, shouting \\"Take your blood money with you\\" as she left the dock in tears. Six of the nine people convicted admitted to Provisional IRA membership. At the court, the judge sentenced the eight to life imprisonment for the bombings and 20 years for conspiracy, while 19 year old William McLarnon who's family was forced out of their home in August 1969 was sentenced to 15 years, when his sentence was read out he shouted \\"Up The Provisional IRA\\".Richard English - Armed Struggle: The History Of The IRA (Macmilian) pg.163 As the eight were led to the cells below the court, several gave raised fist salutes to relatives and friends in the public gallery, who shouted \\"Keep your chins up\\" and \\"All the best\\". The Price sisters immediately went on hunger strike, soon followed by Feeney and Kelly, for the right not to do prison work and to be repatriated to a jail in Ireland. The bombers on hunger strike were eventually moved to jails in Ireland as part of the 1975 IRA truce agreed with the British. In 1983, Kelly escaped from Maze Prison and became part of an IRA ASU in the Netherlands; he was recaptured three years later by the Dutch authorities and extradited. Further IRA bombs in England The Old Bailey bomb was the beginning of a sustained bombing campaign in England. The next major bombing by the IRA in England was the King's Cross station and Euston station bombings which injured 13 people and did widespread damage. Another significant attack that year was the 1973 Westminster bombing which injured 60 people. Two more people would die in England from IRA bombings in 1973, bringing the total to three for the year in that part of United Kingdom.https://www.memorialatpeninsula.org/?p=13737 The next year 1974, was the bloodiest year of the Troubles outside of Northern Ireland with over 70 people being killed in the Republic of Ireland & England combined. 34 were killed in the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, 21 from the Birmingham pub bombings, 12 from the M62 coach bombing and several people were killed by the IRA's Balcombe Street Gang.https://cain.ulster.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch74.htm Sources *CAIN project *Ed Moloney, Voices From The Grave: Two Men's War In Ireland *Peter Taylor, Behind The Mask: The IRA and Sinn Fein References Category:Explosions in 1973 Category:1973 in London Category:Provisional IRA bombings in London Old Bailey bombing Category:Old Bailey Category:1973 crimes in the United Kingdom Category:March 1973 events in the United Kingdom Category:Car and truck bombings in England Old Bailey Category:Building bombings in the United Kingdom ","title":"1973 Old Bailey bombing"},{"id":"48364404","text":"Nigel Aldridge Paul (born 31 March 1933) is a former English cricketer active in the 1950s, making seven appearances in first-class cricket as a batting all-rounder. Paul was educated at Cranleigh School, where he played for the school cricket team from 1949-1951. He made his debut in first-class cricket when he was selected to play for Warwickshire against the touring Canadians at Edgbaston in 1954. He made three further first-class appearances for Warwickshire in 1955, playing two university matches against Oxford and Cambridge, and once against the Combined Services, but did not feature in any County Championship matches. He played a first-class match for the Free Foresters in 1956, and followed this up with two matches at The Saffrons in 1958 for DR Jardine's XI against Oxford University and Cambridge University. In seven first-class matches, Paul scored a total of 157 runs, averaging 15.70, with as high score of 40. As a bowler he took just 3 wickets, which came at an expensive average of 65.33 runs apiece. He was one of the tallest first-class cricketers of the time, standing over two metres high, which he made use of when batting to hit the ball hard, and score at a fast rate which was unusual for the times. His height helped when he was bowling, generating pace which forced the batsman onto the back foot. Paul is a leading figure within the Old Cranleighan Cricket Club, a cricket club for former pupils of Cranleigh School. Following the Second World War, the club was virtually defunct, but he re-formed the club in the mid-1950s. He was club captain from 1958-1964 and president from 1981-1985.

Angel also visits the oncology locked ward sections of children's hospitals and sometimes the hospice units. On most hospital trips, Angel and her human partner go to specific wards, asking the nurses if anyone would like a visit. Sometimes, they knock on patients’ doors. They also respond to special requests made from patients through volunteer services. Angel may be called upon to simply put her paws on the patients’ beds, which allows them to pet her more easily.

The college offers a range of vocational programmes of study including BTECs, and a small number of A-level courses, for students aged 16–19. It also provides teaching of English as an additional language to non-English speaking students aged 14–16 who have been excluded from secondary school. As of 2020, the college has a 'Requires improvement' rating from the statutory inspectorate, Ofsted.https://files.ofsted.gov.uk/v1/file/50150379 History St Katharine's College, the College of All Saints, and Middlesex Polytechnic The original site on which Haringey Sixth Form College today stands was originally home to St Katharine's College, one of the first British teacher training colleges. The St Katharine's College building was constructed in 1878 under the watch of architect Sir Arthur W. Blomfield. St Katharine's College later became the College of All Saints, a Church of England college of higher education and a constituent college of the Institute of Education, University of London. All Saints awarded University of London degrees. The name change was prompted by the 1964 merger of St Katharine's College with Berridge House, Hampstead, and to reflect the Christian ethos of All Saints. The College of All Saints expanded in the 1960s, both in terms of student numbers and estate size, although much of the campus retained its Victorian architecture, including its Anglican chapel, used for corporate worship. The college was highly regarded while part of the University of London, but its reputation suffered almost immediately once it was incorporated into Middlesex Polytechnic, today known as Middlesex University. After the closure of the College of All Saints and merger with Middlesex Polytechnic, the 'All Saints' campus was home to humanities and cultural studies, business studies, law, sociology, and women's studies, all of which have since been moved to other campuses. The buildings, previously occupied by St Katarine's College, then the College of All Saints, and lastly Middlesex Polytechnic, were all demolished, meaning the loss of the historic Victorian architecture including the chapel. All Saints Educational Trust The College of All Saints Foundation, dating from the 1964 merger of St Katharine's College and Berridge House, continues as the All Saint's Educational Trust. Today, the Trust's chairman is the Reverend Keith Riglin, Assistant Dean and Chaplain of King's College London, a university founded in the tradition of the Church of England. Haringey Sixth Form College The site on which the historic buildings once stood is today home to Haringey Sixth Form College. The college, originally established in 2007 as Haringey Sixth Form Centre, resides in a modern building constructed by Middlesex University for their contemporary Tottenham campus, shortly before they abandoned the site. Haringey Sixth Form Centre was opened by Haringey Council to replace the sixth forms of secondary schools in east of the borough, which the council had decided to close owing to poor Ofsted ratings and exam results. Secondary schools in the west of the borough were allowed to keep their sixth forms. However, the centre converted to academy status in 2013, and is now free to offer places to students from all over London. In 2015, the founding Principal, Mrs June Jarrett, was dismissed by the Governing Body (now the Board of Trustees) owing to financial irregularities within the college's finances. The current Principal, who has also taken on the title of Chief Executive, is Mr Russell Lawrance. Performance and data Student numbers and courses As of the 2019/20 academic year, the college has 1,041 students on roll, with the vast majority studying vocational programmes from entry level through to level 3 in areas such as health and social care, media, business, and applied science.https://files.ofsted.gov.uk/v1/file/50150379 Only a few students take academic programmes, with a small cohort of 159 students on A-level courses. This has prompted calls for the college to drop 'sixth form college', which implies an academic focus, from its name in favour of 'further education college', which implies a more vocational focus. Exam results and university progression From its opening in 2007, the College struggled to secure good A-level and vocational results for its students. However, in 2017 the College achieved its highest set of A-level results, with a 4% increase in the number of students achieving higher grades, and two students securing places at Russell Group universities.https://www.haringey6.ac.uk/news-and- events/news/a-level-results-day/ Ofsted inspections and ratings At its first Ofsted statutory inspection in 2008, the centre was judged to be 'Good'. However, by its next full inspection in 2012, it was found to be 'Satisfactory' with a decline in standards.https://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/provider/24/134163 The Centre legally closed in 2013 and Haringey Sixth Form College legally opened in its place as a result of the conversion to academy status. At its first full inspection in 2014, the college was rated 'Requires improvement', the lowest of the four Ofsted ratings (1 Outstanding, 2 Good, 3 Satisfactory, 4 Requires improvement). By its next full inspection in 2015, it had improved considerably and achieved a 'Good' rating. However, as of 2020 and the college's third full inspection, standards had declined significantly and a rating of 'Requires improvement' was once again given.https://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/provider/46/139363 Owing to the poor Ofsted rating and financial difficulties, the future of the college is uncertain. Curriculum Haringey Sixth Form College offers a range of A-levels and BTECs as programmes of study for students. The college also operates dedicated academies for basketball (in partnership with the London Lions) and futsal (in partnership with Tottenham Hotspur F.C.). The majority of programmes at the college are for students aged 16–19; however, the college provides an EAL (English as an additional language) provision for students aged 14–16 who have been excluded from secondary school.

The initiative was announced at a White House Office of Science and Technology Policy event to highlight and promote advances in data-driven scientific discovery, and is a core component of the National Science Foundation's strategic plan for building national capacity in data science.  Working groups  There are six working groups that are common across the three universities included in the original Moore/Sloan grant. The working groups are intended to \\"address the major challenges facing advances in data- intensive research\\" and include Career Paths and Alternative Metrics, Reproducibility and Open Science, Education and Training, Ethnography and Evaluation, Software Tools and Environments, and Working Spaces and Culture. and while all three are separate aspects of one division, they were awarded different grant money.  Notable fellows  A primary objective of BIDS is to build a community of data science fellows and senior fellows across academic disciplines. The 23 current fellows constitute the majority of the onsite liveware at the Institute, which supports a number of notable initiatives (via Fellow support).

The album consists of recordings from the band's appearance at the Cellar in Arlington Heights, Illinois in December 1966. Although the tapes were never anticipated to be released publicly, Raw 'n' Alive at the Cellar is commended for its good sound quality, and represents one of the better live concert recordings to emerge from the garage rock era. Background The Shadows of Knight had initially come to national prominence in early-1966, when their less-risqué interpretation of Them's \\"Gloria\\" reached number 10 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and number eight on Canada's RPM magazine charts. Further successes followed with the band releasing their debut album, Gloria, and reaching the Top 40 for the second time with a cover version of Bo Diddley's song \\"Oh Yeah\\". Throughout the first half of 1966, the band enjoyed tremendous popularity among teenage rock fans and their music received widespread airplay on Top 40 radio. In the latter half of 1966, the Shadow of Knight's second album, Back Door Men, was released, but was less commercially successful than the band's first LP. Combine with the rise of their rival act the Cryan' Shames, the group's popularity was on the decline nationally, though they still remained a top musical attraction in Chicago. Recording at one of Chicago's more happening venues, the Cellar, the Shadows of Knight's setlist for the performance — speculated to have occurred in December 1966 — is composed mainly of blues covers taken from the band's first album. The songs \\"Tomorrow's Gonna Be Another Day\\", \\"Hey Joe\\", and \\"Gospel Zone\\" that represent some of the Back Door Men album, also figure into the Raw N' Alive set. The band noticeably emits a more angst-induced and punkish grit, channeling their own musical stance through the style of the Yardbirds and the Rolling Stones. Raw 'n' Alive also serves as a well-drawn document for the Shadow of Knight's progression as musical artists, with music historian Richie Unterberger pointing to \\"'It Takes a Long Time Comin', an original that never made it to the studio, makes extensive elastic allusions to the Beatles' 'Taxman', Frank Zappa is quoted elsewhere and, most impressively, the group pushes 'Hey Joe' toward the stratosphere, finding a comfortable intersection between a Yardbirds rave-up and proto-psychedelic drone\\". Upon release, Raw 'n' Alive was commended for its good sound quality, even though the tapes were not intended to be a proper release: they are actually tapes Paul Sampson, the owner of the Cellar, happened to make while the Shadows of Knight headlined at the club. On January 27, 2015, Sundazed Records reissued an expanded-version of the recordings, retitled simply as Live 1966. The re-released album features three bonus tracks from the concert, including a rendition of \\"Peepin' and Hidin'\\" sung by lead guitarist Joe Kelley, \\"Willie Jean\\" and \\"Any Way That You Want Me\\", all compiled in a new artwork and a higher-fidelity. In addition, the album also has a rearranged track listing to better approximate the actual order of the Shadow of Knight's performance. Track listing #\\"I Got My Mojo Working\\" (McKinley Morganfield) – 4:07 #\\"Oh Yeah\\" (Ellas McDaniel) – 3:45 #\\"Tomorrow's Going to Be Another Day\\" (Tommy Boyce) – 2:24 #\\"It Takes a Long Time Comin'\\" (Harry Pye) – 2:44 #\\"Let It Rock\\" (Chuck Berry) – 2:06 #\\"Hey Joe\\" (Billy Roberts)The original album incorrectly lists Dino Valenti as the composer for \\"Hey Joe\\". – 4:23 #\\"Gospel Zone\\" (Tom Schiffour) – 1:56 #\\"Got to Get You Off My Mind\\" (Delores Burke, Josephine Burke Moore, Solomon Burke) – 1:47 #\\"Everybody Needs Somebody to Love\\" (Bert Burns, Jerry Wexler, S.

(Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division), revolving around the character of Phil Coulson and his team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents as they deal with the monstrous Lash. It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the films of the franchise. The episode was written by Lauren LeFranc, and directed by David Solomon. Clark Gregg reprises his role as Coulson from the film series, and is joined by series regulars Ming-Na Wen, Brett Dalton, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, Elizabeth Henstridge, Nick Blood, Adrianne Palicki, Henry Simmons, and Luke Mitchell. Matthew Willig guest stars as Lash, with Blair Underwood playing his human form, Andrew Garner. \\"Chaos Theory\\" originally aired on ABC on November 10, 2015, and according to Nielsen Media Research, was watched by 3.49 million viewers.  Plot  With Werner von Strucker comatose and hospitalized, May returns to the Playground and learns Andrew is at another facility, the Cocoon, re-assessing Joey Gutierrez. She goes there and confronts Andrew, revealing she knows he is Lash, at which point he panics and shoots her with an Icer. Lincoln secretly meets with Mack, explaining he has deduced how Lash found the other Afterlife Inhumans. Jiaying had a ledger containing a list of their names, which was recovered by SHIELD after her death, meaning someone inside SHIELD is Lash. Meanwhile, Fitz recovers data from the phone Simmons took to the barren planet, and is deeply moved when he finds a recording of her talking about the history of their friendship and the future she imagined them sharing. He also notices similarities between the logo of Project Distant Star and a symbol carved into the Monolith chamber in the Gloucestershire castle. May awakens in a disused Culver University building, and Andrew explains that Jiaying's ledger was booby-trapped with a Terrigen crystal, which he accidentally triggered six months earlier, causing his Terrigenesis. As his transformations into the Lash form began, he found himself compelled to find other Inhumans, judge their worthiness, and kill them. He broke up with May to protect her from himself, but now he wants her to help him hunt for unworthy Inhumans. He believes she was right to kill Katya Belyakov in Bahrain, and tells her that he is following her example. Coulson arranges to attend a NORAD meeting with President Ellis, in the guise of Price's consultant. En route Price joins him aboard the new Zephyr plane, but her and Daisy's different attitudes to dealing with new Inhumans cause friction. Upon being joined by Mack and Lincoln, Coulson deduces that Andrew is Lash, and immediately goes in search of him and May, accompanied by Daisy, Mack, Lincoln, Price and an ATCU team. Coulson confronts Andrew and attempts to calm him, but Lincoln attacks Andrew in revenge for the deaths of his Afterlife friends. Transforming, Andrew defeats Lincoln, Mack and Coulson, slaughters the ATCU team, and tries to kill Price, who is saved by Daisy. May intervenes and talks Andrew down, but once he reverts to human form, she shoots him multiple times, forcing him into a containment module. Agreeing to stay with S.H.I.E.L.D., Lincoln explains that once Andrew's Inhuman transition completes, he will remain in the form of Lash permanently. To slow this process, May agrees to let the ATCU put him in stasis, in the hope that they will find a cure. Coulson goes back to Price's apartment with her, and they have sex. She later calls Gideon Malick (an apparent colleague), who is in the middle of a meeting with Ward.
