Compare Old Book of Tang, vol. 177 with New Book of Tang, vol. 72.. nickname Zilang (Á∑áÈÉé), formally the Duke of Wei (È≠èÂÖ¨), was an official of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty, serving as a chancellor during the reign of Emperor Zhaozong. He was one of the controversial figures in the late Tang period, who ruthlessly tried to destroy the powerful eunuchs at court and whose actions in that regard had traditionally made him regarded as one of the persons causing the demise of the dynasty at the hands of the warlord Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan) (who would overthrow Tang and establish his own Later Liang).  Background  Cui Yin was born in 854, during the reign of Emperor XuƒÅnzong. He was from the prominent Cui clan of Qinghe (Ê∏ÖÊ≤≥, in modern Xingtai, Hebei), was from the \\"Wushui branch \\" of the prominent Cui clan of Qinghe. Cui Yin's father Cui Shenyou was a chancellor during Emperor XuƒÅnzong's reign. Cui Yin had at least one older brother, Cui Changxia ().New Book of Tang, vol. 72. (According to the biography of the powerful eunuch Qiu Shiliang in the New Book of Tang, Cui Yin developed a hatred for eunuchs early in his life due to Cui Shenyou's relating to him of an incident during the earlier reign of Emperor XuƒÅnzong's nephew Emperor Wenzong, when Qiu tried to have Emperor Wenzong deposed.)New Book of Tang, vol. 207.  Early career  After Cui Yin passed the imperial examinations in the Jinshi () class,Cui Yin's biography in the Old Book of Tang gave the date of his passage of the imperial examinations as the second year of Emperor Zhaozong's Qianning era (895), which was clearly an error, and could have been referring to the second year of Emperor Yizong's Xianning era (861), or, given the error with confusing Cui Yin with his brother Cui Changxia, could have been referring to Cui Changxia's passing the imperial examinations in 895, although that would also appear to be unlikely. The New Book of Tang gave no date for his passage of the imperial examinations. he served on the staff of Wang Chongrong the military governor of Hezhong Circuit (Ê≤≥‰∏≠, headquartered in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi).Old Book of Tang, vol. 177. (Wang was military governor of Hezhong from 881 to Wang's death in 887, placing a timeframe on Cui's service under him.)Old Book of Tang, vol. 182. Later, after Cui was recalled to the imperial government, he served successively as Kaogong Yuanwailang () and then Libu Yuanwailang (), both low- level positions at the ministry of civil service affairs (ÂêèÈÉ®, Libu). He was later promoted to a supervisory position at the ministry of civil service affairs (ÈÉé‰∏≠, Langzhong). He was later made imperial attendant (Áµ¶‰∫ã‰∏≠, Jishizhong) and then Zhongshu Sheren (), a mid-level official at the legislative bureau of government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng). During the Dashun era of Emperor XuƒÅnzong's grandson Emperor Zhaozong (890-891), Cui successively served as deputy minister of defense (ÂÖµÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Bingbu Shilang) then deputy minister of civil service affairs (ÂêèÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Libu Shilang). (It was said that his repeated promotions were a result of his close association with the chancellor Cui Zhaowei, who, while not a close relative, regarded him as a clansman.)  First three terms as chancellor  Thanks to his association with Cui Zhaowei, Cui Yin was promoted to be chancellor in 893 with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (). As chancellor, he was described to be treacherous in his heart but appearing to be forgiving in his outward appearance. (It was also said that his uncle, the major general Cui Anqian, commented, \\"My father and brother had carefully built this household, but Zilang [(i.e., Cui Yin)] will destroy it!\\" although it was unclear whether Cui Anqian was still alive at this point.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 259. In 895, when Wang Chongrong's brother and successor Wang Chongying died at Hezhong (which had been renamed Huguo at this point), the soldiers supported Wang Chongrong's adoptive son and biological nephew Wang Ke to succeed him as the military governor, but Wang Chongying's son Wang Gong, then the military governor of neighboring Baoyi Circuit (‰øùÁæ©, headquartered in modern Sanmenxia, Henan), also had designs on Huguo. Wang Ke was supported by his father-in-law Li Keyong the military governor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), while Wang Gong was supported by his allies Li Maozhen the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (È≥≥Áøî, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), Wang Xingyu the military governor of Jingnan Circuit (ÈùúÈõ£, headquartered in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi), and Han Jian the military governor of Zhenguo Circuit (ÈéÆÂúã, headquartered in modern Weinan, Shaanxi), and all these military governors submitted competing petitions to Emperor Zhaozong in support of Wang Ke or Wang Gong. Emperor Zhaozong initially approved Li Keyong's request and made Wang Ke the military governor of Huguo but, subsequently, trying to settle the dispute, named Cui the military governor of Huguo, still carrying the Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi designation as an honorary title. Wang Tuan was made a chancellor to replace him.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 260. This failed to settle the dispute, however, and, at Cui Zhaowei's instigation (as Cui Zhaowei was allied with Li Maozhen and Wang Xingyu), the three military governors who supported Wang Gong marched on the imperial capital Chang'an, killing the chancellors Li Xi and Wei Zhaodu and forcing Emperor Zhaozong to accede to their demands. That, in turn, caused Li Keyong to launch his troops to attack them. Emperor Zhaozong, fearing that Li Maozhen and/or Wang Xingyu would seize him, fled into the Qinling Mountains. Cui Yin, along with chancellors Xu Yanruo and Wang Tuan, followed the emperor in flight. After Li Keyong defeated Wang Xingyu, who was then killed by his own subordinates, Li Maozhen and Han outwardly submitted to the emperor, and Emperor Zhaozong, after returning to Chang'an, ordered Li Keyong to end his campaign. Meanwhile, Cui was again made a chancellor, and also took the position of Zhongshu Shilang (), the deputy head of the legislative bureau. However, his ally, Cui Zhaowei, was exiled and then executed. In 896, the fragile peace between the imperial government and Li Maozhen ended, and Li Maozhen again postured to attack Chang'an. Emperor Zhaozong and the imperial court initially decided to flee to Hedong, but due to the long distance involved and the urging of Han's, decided to head for Han's capital Hua Prefecture () instead. Once the imperial court settled in at Hua Prefecture, however, Han inserted himself in all kinds of decision-making, and as one of his suggestions, Emperor Zhaozong, who was aware of the alliance between Cui Zhaowei and Cui Yin, decided to send Cui Yin away to serve as the military governor of Wu'an Circuit (Ê≠¶ÂÆâ, headquartered in modern Changsha, Hunan), still carrying the Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi designation as an honorary title; Cui was replaced with Lu Yi. Cui, however, secretly sought aid from Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan) ‚Äî and suggested to Zhu that he could posture by preparing the palace at the eastern capital Luoyang and petitioning Emperor Zhaozong to move the capital to Luoyang. Zhu did so (along with his ally Zhang Quanyi the mayor of Henan Municipality (Ê≤≥Âçó, i.e., the Luoyang region)) and also mobilized his troops; his petition also indicated his belief that Cui, as a faithful servant to the emperor, should not be sent away. Han, in fear of a potential Zhu attack, backed off, and Emperor Zhaozong subsequently kept Cui at court and made him a chancellor again, along with Cui Yuan. Cui Yin, displeased that Lu had replaced him, then falsely accused Lu of being an ally of Li Maozhen's; Lu was then exiled to the post of prefect of Xia Prefecture (Á°§Â∑û, in modern Yichang, Hubei). Cui continued to serve as chancellor until 899, by which time Emperor Zhaozong had returned to Chang'an; Cui assumed just his regular posts of Zhongshu Shilang and minister of civil service affairs (ÂêèÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Libu Shangshu); Lu, who had been recalled by this point and was serving as the minister of defense (ÂÖµÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Bingbu Shangshu), replaced him.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 261. (During this 896-899 term as chancellor, it was said that Cui secretly plotted with the emperor to slaughter the eunuchs. Wang Tuan, fearing the repercussions of such a plot, urged moderation, pointing out that a major confrontation between imperial officials and eunuchs would have uncertain results. When Cui was removed from the chancellor position in 899, he thus suspected Wang of being behind his removal and hated Wang from this point on; he also accused Wang of being in league with the powerful eunuch directors of palace communications Zhu Daobi () and Jing Wuxiu ()Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 262.  Latter two terms as chancellor  In 900, Cui Yin was sent out of the capital to serve as military governor of Qinghai Circuit (Ê∏ÖÊµ∑, headquartered in modern Guangzhou, Guangdong), carrying the Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi as an honorary designation. Cui, believing that Wang Tuan was trying to eliminate him as a rival, wrote Zhu Quanzhong to ask for aid. Zhu Quanzhong, in response, submitted multiple petitions accusing Wang of collaboration with Zhu Daobi and Jing Wuxiu and urging Emperor Zhaozong to keep Cui as a chancellor. As a result, Cui was recalled from his journey to Qinghai. Upon arrival in Chang'an, he was made chancellor again, as well as Sikong (Âè∏Á©∫, one of the Three Excellencies) and Menxia Shilang (), the deputy head of the examination bureau (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng). Wang was initially demoted to be the deputy minister of public works, while Zhu Daobi and Jing were sent out of the capital to serve as eunuch monitors; soon, all three were ordered to commit suicide. After this incident, Cui became, effectively, the most powerful official at court, and the eunuchs hated him. It was said that, because he was jealous of the more senior Xu Yanruo, that Xu decided to ask for the Qinghai assignment himself and was soon made the military governor of Qinghai. The most powerful eunuchs ‚Äî the commanders of the Shence Armies Liu Jishu and Wang Zhongxian () and the new directors of palace communications Wang Yanfan () and Xue Qiwo () ‚Äî fearing the next steps that Cui and Emperor Zhaozong ‚Äî whose behavior had become increasingly erratic after his return from Zhenguo, apparently fueled by alcoholism ‚Äî might take, began to plan a coup to overthrow the emperor and replace him with his son and crown prince Li Yi. In winter 900, after an incident where Emperor Zhaozong killed a few eunuchs and ladies in waiting in a drunken rage, the eunuchs acted. They mobilized the Shence Armies and forced the imperial officials, including Cui (who did not dare to oppose them given their military strength) to sign a petition urging Emperor Zhaozong to yield imperial power to Li Yu. Armed with the petition, the eunuchs then removed the emperor and put him under house arrest, declaring Li Yu emperor instead. Liu killed a number of officials, eunuchs, ladies in waiting, and other people that Emperor Zhaozong favored, but hesitated at killing Cui, fearing that Cui's ally Zhu Quanzhong, whose support for the coup he was trying to court, would react violently. Rather, they only removed Cui from one of his secondary offices, the directorate of salt and iron monopolies. Cui, meanwhile, had been writing Zhu urging him to mobilize his forces to return Emperor Zhaozong to the throne; Zhu's staff member Li Zhen urged the same. Zhu thus put Liu's emissaries to him ‚Äî Liu's adoptive son Liu Xidu () and another eunuch, Li Fengben () ‚Äî under arrest, and sent Li Zhen to Chang'an to personally confer with Cui on what to do next. Cui also sent his secretary Shi Jian () to persuade the Shence Army officer Sun Dezhao () to plan a countercoup. Sun subsequently persuaded his fellow officers Dong Yanbi () and Zhou Chenghui () to join the countercoup as well. In spring 901, they killed Liu Jishu, Wang Zhongxian and Wang Yanfan; Xue committed suicide. They then restored Emperor Zhaozong. It was said that after this series of events Emperor Zhaozong trusted Cui even more. In the aftermaths of Emperor Zhaozong's restoration, Cui urged that he end the eunuch control on the Shence Armies by putting Cui and Lu Yi in command of the Shence Armies, which Cui and Lu reasoned would allow not only the end of eunuch power, but also serve as a counterweight against the warlords. However, this was opposed both by Li Maozhen (who was at Chang'an at that time to pay homage to Emperor Zhaozong) and the three Shence Army officers who restored Emperor Zhaozong to the throne (on whom Emperor Zhaozong had bestowed the imperial clan name of Li, with Sun and Zhou also receiving the new names of Jizhao () and Jihui (), respectively). Emperor Zhaozong thus instead put the eunuchs Han Quanhui and Zhang Yanhong () in command of the Shence Armies. Cui, fearing the return of the Shence Armies to the eunuchs' command, secretly asked Li Maozhen to leave a contingent of 3,000 Fengxiang soldiers at Chang'an, commanded by Li Maozhen's adoptive son Li Jiyun (), to serve as a counterbalance ‚Äî notwithstanding the argument by the imperial scholar Han Wo that the Fengxiang contingent would merely complicate the problem. Around the same time, at Cui's recommendation, his former staff member Wang Pu was made a chancellor as well, along with Pei Shu. Cui thereafter also tried to reduce the money supply of the Shence Armies by ending the yeast monopolies that the armies, including the Shence Armies, held. Li Maozhen, whose Fengxiang army would also be impacted, opposed, and went to Chang'an personally to argue his case to the emperor. When he was at Chang'an, Han took the opportunity to enter into an alliance with him. Cui realized this, and thereafter strengthened his own relationship with Zhu, in opposition to LI Maozhen. By summer 901, Cui and Emperor Zhaozong were again discussing slaughtering the eunuchs. They were communicating by secret sealed notes to each other, but the eunuchs placed several ladies in waiting who were capable of reading in the palace to spy on the emperor, and the ladies in waiting thereafter reported to the eunuchs what Cui and the emperor were planning. When Cui realized this, he feared that the eunuchs would act against him first, and therefore wrote to Zhu, asking him to mobilize his troops and come to the capital to act against the eunuchs. In winter 901, the eunuchs, headed by Han, forced Emperor Zhaozong to flee to Fengxiang. Cui and Li Jizhao (who did not agree with the eunuchs) remained at Chang'an and waited for Zhu's arrival, and thereafter joined forces with him. Zhu evacuated Cui and the other imperial officials, as well as the remaining residents of Chang'an, to Hua Prefecture (which Han Jian had surrendered to Zhu as Zhu headed west toward Chang'an). Zhu subsequently put Fengxiang's capital Fengxiang Municipality under siege, while attacking and seizing Li Maozhen's other possessions in the Guanzhong (i.e., Chang'an's surroundings) region. (During the siege, the eunuchs had Emperor Zhaozong issue an edict removing Cui and Pei from their chancellor positions, but the edict appeared to have no real practical effect.) By 903, Fengxiang was in dire straits due to the lack of food, causing its residents to resort to cannibalism. In desperation, the eunuchs sent out edicts in Emperor Zhaozong's name, ordering the other military governors to attack Zhu, but only Wang Shifan the military governor of Pinglu Circuit (Âπ≥Áõß, headquartered in modern Weifang, Shandong) responded by planning a series of guerrilla attacks against a number of Zhu- held cities, including Hua Prefecture. Wang's officer Zhang Juhou () was in charge of the attack on Hua Prefecture and was successful in killing the acting prefect Lou Jingsi (), but Cui then took over the army and defeated Zhang; Zhang fled and was captured in flight.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 263. Meanwhile, Li Maozhen, resolved to seek peace, killed Han and the other eunuchs, as well as Li Jiyun, Li Jihui, and Li Yanbi, sending their heads to Zhu. Zhu, however, while stopping the active siege efforts, did not initially end the siege. Li Maozhen then had Emperor Zhaozong summon Cui to Fengxiang and restore all of Cui's offices; Li Maozhen also personally wrote Cui in humble terms. Cui, initially fearing that it was a trap by Li Maozhen, refused, but Zhu, asking him to broker a peace agreement, persuaded him to do so. Subsequently, Li Maozhen delivered the emperor to Zhu, and Zhu and Cui escorted Emperor Zhaozong back to the capital. At Cui's and Zhu's urging, Emperor Zhaozong issued an edict ordering the general slaughter of the eunuchs, ending a lengthy period of power for the palace eunuchs. Cui was put in command of the imperial guards generally. Also at Cui's urging, the chancellors Su Jian and Lu Guangqi, who were commissioned by Emperor Zhaozong while Emperor Zhaozong was at Fengxiang and were Li Maozhen's allies, were ordered to commit suicide, while Wang Pu was removed from his chancellor position. Zhu subsequently left Chang'an, but left a Xuanwu contingent at Chang'an, commanded by his nephew Zhu Youlun (). While Cui and Zhu Quanzhong were longtime allies, Cui began to be apprehensive that Zhu intended to control the imperial government by himself and eventually take over the throne. Cui thus urged Emperor Zhaozong to allow him to reconscript soldiers for the imperial guards. In winter 903, Zhu Youlun died in an accident while playing polo ‚Äî but Zhu Quanzhong became convinced that Cui was behind Zhu Youlun's death. He was also suspicious of Cui's intentions in rebuilding the imperial guards, and therefore had soldiers in his own army pretend to be new conscripts and join Cui's imperial guards, to watch what he was doing. In spring 904, Zhu submitted a petition to Emperor Zhaozong, accusing Cui and his associates Zheng Yuangui () the mayor of Jingzhao Municipality (‰∫¨ÂÖÜ, i.e., the Chang'an region) and the army officer Chen Ban () of treason. Emperor Zhaozong, apparently under duress from Zhu, thereafter issued an edict demoting Cui to be an advisor to the Crown Prince, with his office at Luoyang. Soon thereafter, Zhu's soldiers surrounded Cui's mansions and put Cui to death, along with Zheng and Chen.

The two-story brick house is located on the Ashby's Gap Turnpike, near the west end of Middleburg, and is a prominent landmark to those approaching Middleburg from the west. History Cochran built Much Haddam on lands next to his property, which he called \\"Capitol Hill.\\" The house was apparently a speculative venture, since Cochran sold it immediately upon completion to William Swart. Swart sold the house to William F. Broaddus in 1835, who sold it on to Mary P. Waugh in 1840. Waugh sold in 1866 to Robert C. Leechman, followed by several more owners. In 1966 the house was purchased by Emily N. K. Church Hutchinson, who named the house Much Haddam. Description Much Haddam is a five-bay center-hall house. The two-story brick house stands on a prominent stone basement when seen from the downhill side of its sloping site. The roof is standing seam metal. An ell from the rear was originally one story, but was raised to two stories at the beginning of the twentieth century. The ell once had a log extension, which has disappeared.

He escaped and joined Union lines, becoming a sergeant in the 1st South Carolina Volunteers, a Union regiment in the American Civil War.Higginson, Thomas Wentworth. Army Life in a Black Regiment. 1869. He had gained literacy as a slave and after the war joined the Republican Party. He served as a delegate to the 1868 South Carolina Constitutional Convention, becoming known as an orator. He was one of three African-American founders of Aiken County in 1871, helped pick the site for the courthouse, and served as the state legislator from the county through 1874. He also served as a trial judge. Early life and education Born into slavery in Beaufort, South Carolina, Prince R. Rivers worked on the Henry Middleton Stuart, Sr. (1803‚Äì1872) or H.M. Stuart plantation known as Oak Point or Pages Point. He served with the household staff and as carriage driver,Matthew Pinsker, \\"General Hunter ‚ÄúConfiscates‚Äù Prince Rivers\\", 8 November 2012, Emancipation Digital Classroom among the elite of the estate's slaves, and learned to read and write. He escaped from slavery in 1862 after his master moved with his slaves to Edgefield County. Rivers stole one of Stuart's horses and rode through the Confederate lines to Beaufort, which was occupied by Union troops.W. Scott Poole, South Carolina's Civil War: A Narrative History, Mercer University Press, 2005, p. 77 He volunteered to enlist in the Union Army. By the summer of 1862, more than 10,000 slaves had fled from Lowcountry and Midlands plantations to join Union lines along the coast.Poole (2005), South Carolina's Civil War, p. 104.  Serving the Union Army  Rivers was among the slaves (and their families) declared free in 1862 by Union General David Hunter under Congress' Confiscation Act of 1861. Hunter's decision was considered controversial, and the general was prohibited from enlisting former slaves. But they served in \\"Hunter's Regiment\\" with unpaid status for a time, and Rivers said he never regretted it. In 1863, Rivers became a non- commissioned officer in the newly formed 1st South Carolina Volunteers of the United States Colored Troops. His commanding officer, Colonel Thomas Wentworth Higginson, wanted to promote him to a commissioned rank but was prevented by his superiors because of Rivers' race. Higginson said of Rivers in an 1865 article in The Liberator, \\"No anti-slavery novel has described a man of such marked ability. He makes Toussaint perfectly intelligible; and if there should ever be a black monarchy in South Carolina, he will be its king.\\"Higginson, Thomas Wentworth. Army Life in a Black Regiment, online text at Gutenberg Project. The 1st South Carolina Volunteers and other African-American soldiers were promised at enlistment in writing to be paid the same as other soldiers. However, under the Militia Act of 1862, were paid less than half that. They and their supporters lobbied the government but did not gain full pay until June 1864, when an Act of Congress granted them equal pay, including what they were due retroactively. Nearly 180,000 African Americans served in the war and were critical to Union victory. Reconstruction era After the war, Rivers returned to the Edgefield District, eventually settling on a farm outside Hamburg, which became a black-majority town in this period, with a thriving community. He entered the Republican Party and became active in state politics. He had reportedly learned to read and write while a slave, and proved to be a skilled orator and essayist.Jim Nesbitt, \\"County, once booming, now shadows town it used to rival\\" , Augusta Chronicle, 16 February 2004 He served as registrar for Edgefield County in 1867. In the South Carolina Constitutional Convention of 1868, he was the delegate from Edgefield.Reef, Catherine. African Americans in the Military. Infobase Publishing, 2009. He was elected as a state legislator and later as a trial judge, and was deeply involved with Reconstruction politics. Rivers was one of three African- American founders of Aiken County, established by the state legislature in 1871 during Reconstruction, and he helped pick the site for the county courthouse. After a redistricting in 1872, Rivers was the state representative from the newly organized Aiken County. He later served as mayor, county coroner and justice of the peace, all local offices newly available to black candidates. In 1876, Prince Rivers was the judge in a hearing in Hamburg related to events on July 4, when white farmers claimed that an all-black unit of the National Guard blocked the street by their parade on Independence Day. The hearing was attended by more than 100 armed members from nearby Red Shirts chapters, among the thousands of armed white men in rifle clubs; the farmers' lawyer demanded that the black militia be disarmed. Though Rivers tried in a separate meeting to persuade the local Guard militia to give up their weapons, and the white paramilitary to back down, his efforts failed. The freedmen retreated to the armory and held off an attack by the white militia, in which one white man died. They tried to escape after seeing the white militia bring up a cannon. Two blacks were killed on the street, and the white militia captured about 25 freedmen who had left the armory. They murdered four outright later that night while holding them as prisoners at what was called the Dead Ring, and wounded seven other black men. Section VI - pages 221-254Poole, W. Scott. South Carolina's Civil War: A Narrative History, Mercer University Press, 2005, p. 104. After the trial, Rivers' home was burned and property stolen or destroyed by Red Shirts. Violence continued in the following weeks as the white militia worked to suppress black voting in the Upland counties, with a massacre of an estimated 30-100 blacks over several days in September in Ellenton.Mark M. Smith, ‚Äú'All Is Not Quiet in Our Hellish County‚Äô: Facts, Fiction, Politics, and Race - The Ellenton Riot of 1876,‚Äù South Carolina Historical Magazine, Vol. 95, No. 2 (April 1994), 142-155 The Democrats regained control of the state legislature and governor's office in 1876, in an election marked by fraud. It was settled in a national compromise by which the Republican administration agreed to withdraw federal troops from the South, officially ending Reconstruction. In South Carolina, white Democrats passed laws to impose segregation and \\"Jim Crow\\", and continued violence at elections, but African-American George Henry White was elected to US Congress in the 1890s. In 1895 the Democrats passed a new constitution that included requirements that effectively disfranchised blacks in the state. After the rise of whites and imposition of white supremacy, Rivers worked as a house painter and coachman until his death at age 65.Poole, W. Scott. South Carolina's Civil War: A Narrative History.

Although one 19th-century historian recorded that the first church on this location was reportedly established in about 616, no part of any 7th-century structure survives; the oldest parts of the present building date are from the 13th century. Alterations were made in subsequent centuries, but few of them during the 19th century, a time when many other churches in Anglesey were rebuilt or were restored. St Beuno's is part of the Church in Wales, and its parish is one in a group of four. The church remains in use but as of 2013 there is no parish priest. It is a Grade II* listed building, a national designation for \\"particularly important buildings of more than special interest\\", in particular because it is regarded as \\"an important example of a late Medieval rural church\\" with an unaltered simple design. History and location St Beuno's Church is in Trefdraeth, a hamlet in the south-west of Anglesey by Malltraeth Marsh, about south-west of the county town of Llangefni. It stands in a roughly circular llan (Welsh for an enclosed piece of land, particularly around a church) north of the road between Trefdraeth and Bethel. Beuno, a 7th-century Welsh saint, has several churches in north Wales dedicated to him. According to Angharad Llwyd (a 19th- century historian of Anglesey), the first church on this site was reportedly established in about 616. No part of any 7th century building survives, and restoration over the years has removed much historical evidence for the church's development. The earliest parts of the present structure are the nave and the chancel, which are 13th-century. The church shows signs of alterations and additions in subsequent centuries. A transept or chapel was added to the south side of the chancel in the late 13th or early 14th century. The arch between them was once the archway between the chancel and the nave but was later moved. The bellcote at the west end of the roof was added in the 14th century. The porch on the south side of the nave was built in about 1500, and was re-roofed in 1725. A doorway in the north wall of the nave was inserted in the late 15th or early 16th century, and now leads into a vestry added in the 19th century. The main roof is largely 17th-century. Some repairs were carried out in the 1840s, with further repairs in 1854 under the supervision of the diocesan architect, Henry Kennedy. Benefice St Beuno's is one of four churches in the benefice of Trefdraeth with Aberffraw with Llangadwaladr with Cerrigceinwen. Other churches in the benefice include St Beuno's, Aberffraw and St Cadwaladr's, Llangadwaladr. The church is in the Deanery of Malltraeth, the Archdeaconry of Bangor and the Diocese of Bangor. As of 2013 the parishes have no incumbent priest. A number of notable clergy have held the living of St Beuno's. Henry Rowlands, Bishop of Bangor 1598‚Äì1616, was rector of Trefdraeth during his episcopacy, as the income from the parish was attached to the bishopric. The scholar and rhetorician Henry Perry was appointed priest in 1606. Griffith Williams was appointed rector in 1626 and went on to be Dean of Bangor in 1634. David Lloyd was rector in the late 1630s and early 1640s, and thereafter Dean of St Asaph. Robert Morgan was rector before and after the English Civil War and was made Bishop of Bangor in 1666. John Pryce was rector 1880‚Äì1902 and Dean of Bangor 1902‚Äì1903. =Welsh language controversy= In 1766 John Egerton, Bishop of Bangor, appointed an elderly English priest, Dr Thomas Bowles, to the parish of St Beuno, Trefdraeth and its chapelry of St Cwyfan, Llangwyfan. Between them the parish and chapelry had about 500 parishioners, of whom all but five spoke only Welsh, whereas Bowles spoke only English. The parishioners and churchwardens of Trefdraeth petitioned against Bowles's appointment, arguing that the appointment of a priest who did not speak Welsh breached the Articles of Religion, the Act for the Translation of the Scriptures into Welsh 1563 and the Act of Uniformity 1662. In 1773 the Court of Arches ruled that only clergy who could speak Welsh should be appointed to Welsh-speaking parishes, and Bowles should not have been appointed, but he now held the ecclesiastical freehold of the benefice and the case to deprive him of it had not been proved. The court therefore let Bowles stay in post, which he did until he died in November of that year. Bowles was then replaced in the parish and chapelry with Richard Griffith, a priest who spoke Welsh. Architecture and fittings St Beuno's is Decorated Gothic, built mainly with rubble masonry, with squared stones used to create courses in the nave's south wall and the lower part of the west wall. There are external buttresses at the west and east ends, the south porch and the south transept. The roof is surfaced with hexagonal slates and has a stone bellcote on its west gable. Internally, there is no structural division between the nave and the chancel save for a step up to the chancel. The nave and chancel together are long and the church is wide. Near the eastern end of the church is a transept or chapel on the south side of the chancel, from which it is separated by a step down and an arch. The transept is by . The windows range in age from the late 14th or early 15th century to the 19th century. The oldest is the chancel east window, which has an 18th-century inscribed slate slab as its sill. The window is a pointed arch with three lights (sections of window separated by mullions), and it has a stained glass of the Crucifixion of Jesus that was installed as a memorial in 1907. The nave north wall has a window from about 1500, which was originally in the nave south wall. The nave west window is rectangular, again from about 1500. In the nave south wall are two early 19th-century windows set in square frames, one single-light and one two-light. The transept has a 19th-century two-light arched window in its south wall, which contains the oldest stained glass in the church: 15th- century fragments of a crucifixion scene. It also has a pointed arched doorway in its west wall, from the late 13th or early 14th century. The church is entered through the porch to the west end of the south wall of the nave, which leads to an arched doorway. There are two 18th-century slate plaques on the walls by the south door commemorating those who made donations to the poor of the parish; one has names from 1761, the other from 1766. On the opposite wall, a 17th-century slate plaque commemorates Hugh ap Richard Lewis and his wife Jane (died 1660 and 1661 respectively). The internal timbers of the roof, some of which are old, are exposed, but there is a decorated panelled barrel- vaulted ceiling above the sanctuary at the east end of the church. The transept roof is largely 17th-century. The cylindrical font is 12th-century, and is at the west end of the church. Four of its six panels are decorated with saltires; a fifth has a Celtic cross in knotwork with a ring; the sixth is blank. One author has pointed out the similarities with the fonts of St Cristiolus's, Llangristiolus, which is about away, and of St Beuno's, Pistyll, in the nearby county of Gwynedd. A survey by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire in 1937 also noted the early 18th-century communion rails, a plain oak communion table dated 1731, and a wooden font cover dated 1714. Other memorials, including parts of an early 14th-century inscribed slab, were also recorded. Three items of church silver were included in the survey: a cup (dated 1610‚Äì1611), a paten (1719) and a flagon (1743). Externally, an 18th-century brass sundial on a slate pedestal was noted, as was a weathered decorated stone on the lychgate, thought to be from the 10th century. The Arts and Crafts Movement pulpit was made in 1920. Churchyard The churchyard contains the Commonwealth war graves of a Royal Engineers soldier of World War I and a Pioneer Corps soldier of World War II. CWGC Cemetery report, breakdown obtained from casualty record. Assessment The west end and north vestry during repair work in 2008 The church has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it has been designated a Grade II* listed building ‚Äì the second- highest of the three grades of listing, designating \\"particularly important buildings of more than special interest\\". It was given this status on 30 January 1968, and has been listed because it is \\"an important example of a late Medieval rural church\\". Cadw (the Welsh Assembly Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales and the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists) also notes that the church's \\"simple design [remained] unaltered during the extensive programme of church re-building and restoration on Anglesey in the 19th century.\\" In 1833 Angharad Llwyd described the church as \\"a small neat edifice\\", with \\"an east window of modern date and of good design\\". She noted that the parish registers, legible from 1550 onwards, were the second oldest in north Wales. Similarly, the 19th-century publisher Samuel Lewis said the church was a \\"small plain edifice\\" that could hold nearly 300 people. In 1846 the clergyman and antiquarian Harry Longueville Jones wrote that the church \\"has been lately repaired in a judicious manner, but without any restoration of importance being attempted, and is in good condition\\". He added that with its \\"good condition this ranks as one of the better churches of the island.\\" The Welsh politician and church historian Sir Stephen Glynne visited the church in October 1849. He said that the chapel on the south side resembled several others in Anglesey and Caernarfonshire. He also noted the new slate roof, the \\"mostly open and plain\\" seats, and the \\"very large cemetery ... commanding an extensive view\\". A 2006 guide to the churches of Anglesey describes St Beuno's as being in \\"a pleasant and quiet rural location\\". It adds that the church was \\"fairly small\\" and the roof had \\"unusual ornately-shaped slates\\". A 2009 guide to the buildings of the region comments that \\"for once\\" Kennedy had repaired rather than replaced the church. It notes that \\"strangely\\" the chancel arch had been reset in the transept, and says that the nave roof was of \\"unusual construction\\".

He was there at Uluwatu when Gerry Lopez and Jeff Hackman were first surfing the Indonesian waves, and was privy to their first famous trip to Grajagan (Gland) in Java on the catamaran with Mike Boyam, Malan, Jack McCoy and Bob Laverton etc. He was also there to see Richard Harvey walk north from Uluwatu to discover and surf Padang Padang. He was always in the company of legendary surfers who could not help but like and respect him. In 1974 Gerry Lopez gave him his lightning bolt surfboard as a token of good waves and company together. He died on 26 March 2009 in Bali.

His parents separated while he was a young boy; his mother single-handedly raised him, although his father visited the family regularly. He has eight siblings. He was fascinated with business at a very young age; as a child he sold indigenous food after school to contribute to the household income while his mother worked as a domestic worker. As with every business, money is the key and the main objective: Whenever he got, he used the change to buy sweets and resold them at school to get more money and increase cash-flow. At the age of nine, he started cleaning yards and got paid weekly. This was a great incentive for him but later he realized that the money coming in weekly was not enough to buy enough stock to satisfy the demand for the product (sweets) at school. He arranged to receive the money month-end; that improved the cash-flow and the stock levels. As the cash-flow improved, he bought a bicycle to extend his operations. The bicycle took him three years to pay off. His first shop was a cardboard-box in front of his mother's house in the black township, called \\"the Location\\". Mr Watyako Mumbala from Elim Omunda gwambala he is a founder of Wamu Group of Companies Business career Hauwanga opened his first spares shop in Ongwediva, selling car parts. He grew this business from suppliers in Windhoek and Johannesburg and then to the world. He has several operations around the country and has expanded into neighboring Angola. His operations in Angola are property development; he has completed several projects in Angola. Benjamin \\"BH\\" has branches of the BH Group of Companies across Namibia with branches in Kavango, Oshana, Omusati, Khomas and Ohangwena. Benjamin Hauwanga joins an elite group of Namibian businessmen in owning a private plane. His Beechcraft 55 Baron aircraft is believed to have cost around N$3 million. He says he bought it to improve the logistical dimensions of his business operations. He bought it from Rami Barnes, a South African entrepreneur. Hauwanga is the owner of the Bennies Entertainment Park and Lodge in Ongwediva. Controversies In 2008, Hauwanga was involved in a legal saga with another prominent businessman, Harold Pupkewitz. The legal showdown that erupted was over money that the BH businesses claim to have lost in non-existent orders and deliveries from Pupkewitz: the amount of money in discussion was N$4 947 250.60. The dispute arose from payments that BH Motor Spares alleges to have made to Pupkewitz for goods that they had neither ordered nor received from the motoring mogul. BH claims that Pupkewitz invoiced and collected money for the orders. The sum of N$4 947 250.60 is accordingly due, owing and payable by the defendant to the plaintiff which sum, the defendant, despite demand, fails and/or refuse to pay to the plaintiff. Hauwanga was represented by Sisa Namandje law firm while Pupkewitz was represented by the Lorentz Hangula Inc. law firm. In 2009, BH was also involved in a scandal with the grandson of the former president Sam Nujoma. Joseph Nakanyala, grandson of Nujoma, tried to extort Hauwanga by using Nujoma's cell phone in June purporting to be the former president. In SMSs, Nakanyala threatened to kill Hauwanga if he did not give him money. Nakanyala was caught red-handed by the police while stealing a briefcase with money from Nujoma's residence and he later claimed that Hauwanga had sent him. Through thorough investigations it was concluded that Nakanyala made all the stories up in an attempt to extort Hauwanga. Nakanyala withdrew his claims and publicly apologized to Hauwanga through lawyer Sisa Namandje. In a statement signed by Nakanyala, he acknowledged having made these allegations saying: \\"I had no basis and right at the time of making such allegations to accuse Mr Benjamin Hauwanga. I acknowledge and recognize that the allegations I made have injured the good reputation and name of Mr Hauwanga, and I unconditionally and unreservedly apologize to him , his family, friends and all those who have been affected and inconvenienced by the false allegations I made\\" the statement reads further. The two shook hands and embraced warmly after Nakanyala finished reading his apology. Honours In 2011, Hauwanga received an honorary master's degree in Entrepreneurship (honoris causa) from the International University of Management (IUM).

The Early Commercial-style building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 as \\"Provo West Co- op\\".  Provo West Cooperative Mercantile Institution  Built to encourage trading among the Latter Day Saints, the Provo West Co-op was one of the first stores built in the city under the cooperative merchandising movement sponsored by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints of the late 1800s. Provo West Co-op was designated to the Provo City Historic Landmarks Registry on March 21, 1996. Cooperative Trading The City of Provo was settled by members of the LDS church in the year 1849. At this time, the members of the town subsisted primarily through agriculture. Most material goods were transported from Salt Lake City to Provo, where they were exchanged for food. In 1853, Andrew J. Stewart opened Provo's first store inside of his home. In 1869, the store that he later built on Center Street in the City of Provo became the Provo West Co-op. Profits for merchants in Utah were doing fairly high at this time during the 1860s. However, the farmers and the LDS church, who subsisted through agriculture did not receive much of a profit, if any. Subsequently, they began to resent the merchants for their success. Brigham Young, President of the LDS church at that time instructed members to \\"Cease paying exorbitant prices demanded by disinterested persons...and hundreds of thousands of dollars may be saved annually by the saints.\\" In an attempt to lower the price of flour for the saints, the Utah Produce Co. was organized under church leadership. It was hoped that the produce company would be able to secure all of the grain in the area, and then control the price of flour by monopoly. The effort did not last long and eventually failed. With the railroad on its way toward Utah, many members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, feared that the situation would only be made worse, with more outsiders making even greater profits off of the Mormons. History Samuel S. Jones and David John were the first to take action towards building a cooperative trading store. In December 1868, plans were drawn up for the store. Subscriptions at the time of the meeting amounted to $5,000 at the time, and by the end of the month totalled $17,000. The original place and merchandise for the new Cooperative store was purchased from H.W. Lawrence, who sold his goods at cost ($22,880.34), and his building worth $10,400 for $10,000. This store eventually became known as the ‚ÄúEast Co-op.‚Äù It was then proposed that the women of the Relief Society (The women's organization within the LDS church) take a part in the cooperative system. The women agreed, and on March 24, 1869, they held a meeting to discuss how they might best assist the program. Although originally they had thought to build four stores, one for each ward in Provo, during the meeting they agreed that they would begin with one until sufficient capital was gained to expand. They purchased the building built in 1869 by Andrew Stewart on Center Street, and Samuel S. Jones was made manager. Although originally referred to as the ‚ÄúFemale Store‚Äù and the ‚ÄúWomen‚Äôs Co-op,‚Äù the store eventually became known as the ‚ÄúWest Co-op.‚Äù After the completion of the Cooperative trading system in Provo, Brigham Young was able to convince Salt Lake city merchants to cooperate with the system. As a result, the Zion's Cooperative Mercantile Institution (Z.C.M.I.) was put into operation, and goods were able to be purchased there and sold from the Provo Stores. = Success = Both the East and West Cooperative Mercantile Institutions experienced financial success. The West more so than the East, as its goods were purchased at a lower rate due to them being transported on the railroad. After approximately three months of running, profits totalled $254.15. Dividends paid out were between twenty and thirty percent. Wanting to follow in these store's footsteps, more new cooperatives were developed in Provo, such as the Cooperative Boot and Shoe Store, Pottery, Woolen Mills, Meat Market, Grist Mill, Bricks, Stock- herd, Drug Store, and a Clothing and Tailoring Store. = Structure = The building is Early Commercial in style. It is a two-story flat-roofed building with a brick exterior. The interior core, of wood and adobe was built around 1866. Its brick exterior was added around 1890 by the Provo West Co-op before it went out of business. With A two-story painted brick building, the Provo West Co-op is in relatively good condition today. The inside of the Co-op consists of wood and adobe. One bay deep and three bays wide, Tuscan columns built on pedestals surround the entryway, and the Victorian Eclectic style detail is evident in the double hung sash windows on the second floor. Dentils and consoles are symmetrically aligned on the cornice. Although changes have been made and the building does not retain its original integrity, it still preserves much of the character of the buildings of the late 1800s.

It is the seat of the Diocese of Grand Rapids. History St. Andrew‚Äôs history traces its beginning to the founding of St. Mary‚Äôs Church by the Rev. Frederic Baraga. He built a small church, rectory and school on the west bank of the Grand River and the people who attended the church were Native Americans. The Rev. Andreas Viszoczky was named the parish‚Äôs first pastor two years later. After the Native Americans left and the town of Grand Rapids grew, Father Viszoczky built a new church on Monroe Street which he named St. Andrew. The church building was constructed of Grand River limestone and completed in 1850. Grand Rapids continued to grow as did the parish and a new church was soon needed. In 1875, the present church was started on Sheldon Boulevard and completed a year later. On May 19, 1882 Pope Leo XIII established the Diocese of Grand Rapids. The diocese‚Äôs first bishop Henry J. Richter chose Saint Andrew‚Äôs as his cathedral and was consecrated in it on April 22, 1883. Lightning struck the cathedral in 1901 and a fire destroyed part of the church building. It was rebuilt and expanded. Some of the wooden beams above the ceiling still show the charred marks from the fire. A television studio was created in the cathedral in the 1950s to televise a weekly Sunday Mass. The cameras have been updated in the 21st century to provide for digital broadcasts. Another expansion of the cathedral facilities occurred from 1961-1963. The St. Ambrose Chapel wing was added at that time and Maple Street from Sheldon to Division was closed and a green space created. A major renovation of the cathedral in 1979-1980 brought the altar forward into the congregation and a vesting and gathering area was created. Another major renovation from 1997-2000 created a baptismal pool and refurbished the stained glass windows and the Stations of the Cross. The current pipe organ was installed in 2002. The front entrance of the cathedral was remodeled in 2009 and the Piazza Secchia was laid. It is patterned after the piazza created by Michelangelo on the Capitoline Hill in Rome.

Description The amphitheater's castle tower, June 2018 The facility is located at 1300 East Center Street on the grounds of the Utah State Hospital (a mental hospital operated by the Utah Department of Human Services). It is believed to be one of the first and largest amphitheaters built in the state. The recreation center covers three acres, seating 800 within its amphitheater and attached interior rooms. The amphitheater itself is set against the hillside next to the hospital. \\"It is constructed almost entirely of stone, as are the attached rooms and two-story towers at the southeast and northwest corners. The towers and the ‚Äúbattlements‚Äù of various sections of railing give the structure a castle-like appearance. Attached to the tower at the southeast corner is a large interior room with a fireplace, and above, on its flat roof, is another fireplace and an open-air area for social gatherings. Stone ramps at both the north and south sides provide access to the amphitheater from the grass play area at the base of the facility (Historic Preservation Research Office p. 2).‚Äù The man responsible for drawing up the plans and supervising the work on site is Lavar S. Morris. Despite plans to eventually build additional recreational facilities on site, such as tennice courts, a handball court, and picturesque gardens, the recreation center remains the only recreational facility near the hospital. and For nearly three decades (1971-1997) the facility was the site of the annual Haunted Castle during the Halloween season. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places April 9, 1986. Historical significance During the time of the great depression, the State of Utah was hit hard economically; harder than most of the states. The state had an unemployment rate of 36 percent in 1933, which was the fourth highest in the country. The unemployment rate averaged 25 percent over eight years, between 1932 and 1940. Due to this crisis, and the fact that Utah was worse off than other states, Utah received more federal assistance than many other states. Per capita federal spending in Utah in the 1930s was 9th highest among the 48 states. Many public buildings were built with the funds now provided by the national government. This recreation center is historically significant because it represents and helps document the impact of New Deal programs enforced by the federal government during this time of crisis. The structure was built in 1936‚Äì37.

Synopsis Narrated by Carl Colby, son of the late Director of Central Intelligence William E. Colby, The Man Nobody Knew traces the elder Colby's career in the U.S. intelligence community, along with and in contrast to his home life, including the secrets he kept from his family. The film begins with Colby's service in World War II as an officer and paratrooper with the OSS, and follows his rise through the Central Intelligence Agency, where his roles included political covert action to oppose the Communist Party in Italy, later counterinsurgency actions and involvement in the 1963 coup in South Vietnam (in concert with President John F. Kennedy) during the Vietnam War, and later as Director of Central Intelligence in the 1970s. During his brief, tumultuous tenure leading the agency, Colby revealed the existence of documents describing illegal activities by the CIA, known as the \\"Family Jewels\\", in an effort to reform the agency. The film concludes with Colby's disappearance and death in April 1996. Production The Man Nobody Knew was produced by Carl Colby, with David Johnson and Grace Guggenheim, for Act 4 Entertainment. The film combines archival footage with new interviews, including Zbigniew Brzezinski, Brent Scowcroft, James R. Schlesinger, Donald Rumsfeld, Bob Woodward and Seymour Hersh, among others. William Colby's former wife and Carl Colby's mother, Barbara Colby, is also interviewed regarding Colby's public career and private life. Release U.S. distribution rights were acquired by First Run Features. The film will premiere at Lincoln Plaza Cinemas in New York City on September 23, 2011, followed by a national theatrical release. Reception Reviews for The Man Nobody Knew have been favorable. Time Out New York called it a \\"tour of queasy, morally questionable intelligence endeavors over the last 50 years from the perspective of the spook community's grand pooh-bah\\". A review in The Village Voice stated that the film's \\"thorough investigation transcends [director Colby's] personal catharsis to become an enduring treatise on how character flaws affect policy\\". The Man Nobody Knew was designated a \\"Critics' Pick\\" by The New York Times film reviewers.

Rodrigo M. Santucci and Antonio C. de Arruda-Campos (2011) in their cladistic analysis found Aeolosaurus, Gondwanatitan, Maxakalisaurus, Panamericansaurus and Rinconsaurus to be aeolosaurids. Aeolosaurini is characterized by several synapomorphies of the caudal vertebrae, such as angled centra, elongate prezygapophyses, and neural arches shifted anteriorly relative to the centra. In life, their tails may have been strongly curved downward as a result of these traits, which may have increased the force exerted by the caudofemoralis longus muscle in retracting the hindlimb. Some aeolosaurins, such as Shingopana and Overosaurus, were relatively small compared to other titanosaurs, whereas others, such as Aeolosaurus maximus, were large. Phylogeny Aeolosaurini was defined by Franco-Rosas, Salgado, Rosas and Carvalho (2004) as the stem- based taxon that corresponds to the most-inclusive clade containing Aeolosaurus rionegrinus and Gondwanatitan faustoi, but not Saltasaurus loricatus and Opisthocoelicaudia skarzynskii. Below is a cladogram showing the phylogenetic relationships of Aeolosaurini-based Santucci and Arruda-Campos (2011), from Franca et al. (2016) on the left, and Silva et al. (2019) on the right.

The law extends taxes which fund federal highway expenditures through March and the Federal Aviation Administration through January. The Surface and Air Transportation Programs Extension Act of 2011 is a direct result of an agreement which was reached by the House and Senate majority leaders. This extension act was a top priority to Congress because federal highway and FAA funding was about to expire. Voting facts The bill passed through the United States House of Representatives on September 13, 2011, and through the United States Senate on September 15, 2011. President Obama signed the bill on September 16, 2011. Committee assignments Committees are formed to critique the proposed bill and to aid in lobbying to the United States Congress for consideration. The Surface and Air Transportation Programs Extension Act of 2011 was on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and the House Ways and Means Committee. Amendments On September 15, 2011, two amendments were introduced to the legislation. Senator Paul, a Republican from Kentucky, introduced both amendments. The first amendment set limits on the Highway Trust Fund, and the second amendment decreased disbursements of the Federal Aviation Administration. FAA Headquarters, Washington, D.C. Bill-to-law highlightshttp://rsc.jordan.house.gov/UploadedFiles/LB_09132011.pdf *Highway programs: limit of $42.5 billion; authorizations for surface transportation research extended *Highway safety programs: authorization of $335 million administered by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration broken down with $117.5 million going to Chapter 4 Highway Safety Programs; $54.122 million going to Highway Safety Research and Development; $12.5 million given towards Occupant Protection Incentive Grants; $24.25 given towards Safety Belt Performance Grants; $17.25 given towards State Traffic Safety Information Systems Improvements; $69.5 million given towards Alcohol-Impaired Driving Counter-Measures Incentives Grant Program; $2.05 million given towards National Driver Register; $14.5 million given towards High Visibility Enforcement Program; $3.5 million given towards Motorcyclist Safety, $3.5 million given towards Child Safety and Child Booster Seat Safety Incentive Program; and $12.66 million given towards Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) Administrative Expenses (signed by President George W. Bush on August 10, 2005). *Transit programs: the bill allowed for the obligation of upwards to $5.1 billion administered by the Federal Transit Administration allocation of $4.18 billion for formula and bus grants; $800 million for capital investment grants; $29.5 million for research and university centers; and $49.45 million for Federal Transit administrative costs *Provisions impacting essential air service: the Essential Air Service program was enacted to guarantee that small communities in the United States are served by certified airlines and maintained commercial service. H.R. 2887 (Surface and Air Transportation Programs Extension Act of 2011) changes the EAS by currently allocating funds out of the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. There will be $150 million taken from this fund from January‚ÄìApril 2012. Legislation has then agreed to have $50 million given each fiscal year from administrative accounts of over flight fees. There will an additional allocation of $2 million from January‚ÄìApril 2012 for the Small Community Air Service Development program. This program allows the Transportation Department to offer grants to small cities not already receiving sufficient air carrier service. Extension of federal-aid highways Funds for federal aid to highways will be allocated from the Highway Trust Fund, but none to be taken from the Mass Transit Account, for projects between the time-frame of October 1, 2011 - March 31, 2012.http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112hr2887ih/pdf/BILLS-112hr2887ih.pdf Summary details Extended funds have been allocated towards: *Research and development, including deployment initiatives within surface transportation *Training and education *Bureau of Transportation statistics and analysis *Research within intelligent transportation systems Transportation program funds extended *Interstate and national highway system *Congestion mitigation and air quality improvement *Highway safety improvement *Surface transportation *Highway bridge A construction worker with column reinforcement steel Details The Surface and Air Transportation Act provided funding for: *highway construction *bridge repair *mass transit systems *keeping construction workers employedDaily Compilation of Presidential Documents, 8/31/2011, p1-3, 3p Benefits relating to the passing of the bill *4,000 workers did not go one day without pay *$1 billion in highway funding did not go unattended *over 1 million workers were able to keep their jobs Arguments against the temporary fix Although the American Trucking Association (ATA) is relieved that the act was extended ensuring further job proposals, the organization feels it is only a quick fix that will essentially boost employment temporarily. The organization is pushing for passing multi-year legislation, instead of, multi-month legislation. The organization feels that this is a long overdue problem that is being fixed on a short, temporary basis.Overdrive, Oct2011, Vol. 51 Issue 10, p71-71, 1/4p The ATA's President, Bill Graves, is not convinced, and even though $27.5 billion in the jobs proposal initiated by Obama is going to help boost the nation's economy, by way of, funding needed repairs and expanding roads and bridges. It is only scratching the surface to the real problem at hand. Graves is skeptical of Obama's plans, in regards to, establishing an infrastructure bank and increasing other taxes to pay for roads, bridges, and other programs in the jobs bill. American Society of Civil Engineers The American Society of Civil Engineers spoke loudly to Congress regarding passing the Surface and Air Transportation Programs Extension Act of 2011, and to increase funding to aid in the country's broken infrastructure system. The programs were extended through to January 31, 2012. According to the \\"Failure to Act\\" division, if the United States does not invest in surface transportation programs soon, she will lose $900 billion.This Week in Washington; 9/9/2011, p6-6, 1p Related Obama Administration political initiatives The logo of the Transportation Security Administration. *Surface Transportation Security Priority Assessment (March, 2010): part of Obama's Homeland Security initiative, this assessment seeks to analyze the United States surface transportation system, which consists of Mass Transit, Highways, Freight Rail, and Pipelines. This interdependent network services millions of communities every day and is critical to the United States' economy. With more terrorist attacks on the world's mass transit systems, securing the surface transportation network from attacks requires efforts from many levels, including, but not limited to, all levels of government, the private and nonprofit sectors, communities, and citizens alike. *The American Jobs Act: the key facts to this act includes tax cuts to help America's small businesses hire more people and grow in the industry, putting more workers back to work and rebuilding and modernizing America in the process, building pathways for Americans looking for job opportunities, tax cuts for the American worker and his/her family, and funded by Obama's long-term deficit reduction plan.

Leaders from the United Nations' Member States addressed the General Assembly concerning topics of national, regional and international importance.  Organisation  The speaking order of the general debate is different from the speaking order of other General Assembly debates. For the general debate, the Secretary-General speaks first delivering their \\"Report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization, \\" they are then followed by: the President of the General Assembly who opens the general debate, the delegate from Brazil and the delegate from the United States of America. After this, the order is first given to Member States, then Observer States and supranational bodies. For all other Member States, speaking order is based on their level of representation at the general debate, order preference and other criteria such as geographic balance. According to the rules in place for the general debate, statements should be made in one of the United Nations' official languages of Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian or Spanish, and are translated by United Nations translators. Additionally, speakers are usually limited to a 15-minute time limit in order to comply with the schedule set up by the General Committee. Member States are also advised to provide 350 paper copies of their statements in order for them to be distributed to other Member States, as well as to translation services. The theme for the 66th Session was chosen by President Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser as: \\"The role of mediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful means.\\" The theme of a Session is typically suggested by the President-elect of the General Assembly prior to their inauguration and the beginning of the Session, and is decided upon via informal discussions with Member States, the current President of the General Assembly and the Secretary-General. This theme is then communicated to Member States in a letter, whereupon the Member States are invited to focus their general debate speeches on the proposed theme.

Serbia (First) Serbia used its Right of Reply to respond to statements made by Albania in its general debate speech before the Assembly. Albania, in its speech, brought up the topic of Kosovo, and its independence movement. Specifically, Albania called upon Serbia to recognize, and comply, with the International Court of Justice and its 2010 decision which stated that Kosovo's declaration of independence did not violate international law. Albania also called upon all Member States to recognize the independence of Kosovo. Finally, Albania mentioned that the Government of Kosovo was committed to implementing the rule of law, but was being met with resistance from criminal groups and organized gangs in Serbian towns in the north of the country. Serbia responded by stating that Albania's statement was full of \\"misrepresentations and falsehoods.\\" First, Serbia pointed out that Kosovo had taken various coercive actions in order to create fait accompli on issues on which negotiations were still pending, creating tension and conflict that endangered the negotiation process. Additionally, Serbia stated that Albania had misrepresented the ICJ's ruling. Albania stated that the declaration was found by the Court to be \\"in full compliance with international law,\\" when in reality the Court found that \\"general international law contains no applicable prohibition of declarations of independence.\\" Serbia posited that the Court left the real question unanswered. Finally, Serbia claimed that Serbian cultural heritage in Kosovo was not as secure as Albania stated, as in 2004 over 30 Christian Orthodox churches were destroyed, with the remaining churches being routinely desecrated. Albania (First) Albania used its Right of Reply to respond to Serbia's Right of Reply. It began by stating that an ever-growing number of Member States were convinced that an independent Kosovo was the only solution for the war-torn region. Albania then reiterated that the ICJ ruling stated that the declaration of independence did not violate any provision of international law and that Serbia was expected to accept and respect the Court‚Äôs findings as laid out in Chapter XIV of the United Nations Charter. It then mentioned a speech made by German Chancellor Angela Merkel in which she called upon Serbia to implement agreements with Kosovo, allow the European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX) to operate in the entire territory of Kosovo, and abolish the parallel structures in the North. Albania finished by calling on Serbia to accept the findings of the EULEX investigation. Serbia (Second) Serbia stated that its delegation was finished with the Kosovo issue and did not want to continue the debate and left the Member States to draw their own conclusions. Albania (Second) Albania agreed as it did not want to prolong the discussion. = 26 September 2011 = Morning schedule * ‚Äì Vice President Mompati S.

Iran (Islamic Republic of) Iran used its Right of Reply to respond to statements made by the United Arab Emirates in its general debate speech before the Assembly. In its speech, the UAE called the occupation by Iran of Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunbs illegitimate. It further stated that it had taken action to resolve the issue and hoped to resolve it through direct bilateral negotiations or by referral to the International Court of Justice. Furthermore, the UAE expressed concern over the lack of progress in resolving the issue. Finally, it condemned actions taken by Iran that aimed at changing the legal, physical and demographic situation of the islands, calling these actions a violation of international law, as well as of the United Nations Charter. It finished by calling on Iran to enter into serious and direct negotiations. Iran responded by stating that the islands were \\"an eternal part of Iranian territory and are under the sovereignty of the Islamic Republic of Iran.\\" It further stated that all actions taken on the Iranian island of Abu Musa had been in exercise of its sovereign rights and were in accordance with documents exchanged in 1971 between Iran and the Emirate of Sharjah. Iran alsostated it was ready to continue bilateral talks with the United Arab Emirates with a view to removing any misunderstanding that may exist in regard to the islands. Finally, Iran stated that the only correct and universally recognized name for the sea between Iran and the Arabian peninsula is the Persian Gulf, as recognized by the United Nations itself. Egypt Egypt used its Right of Reply to respond to statements made by Canada in its general debate speech before the Assembly. In its speech, Canada stated that Member States had the duty to defend the vulnerable, to challenge aggression and to protect and promote human rights and human dignity. Specifically, it called for the protection of various groups, including Copts in Egypt, which it claimed were \\"being assaulted and killed.\\" Egypt responded by calling these allegations \\"utterly false\\". It called upon Canada to more closely examine events of the Egyptian revolution of 2011 and the social solidarity that it created in Egypt. More specifically, Egypt claimed that during the revolution Muslims and Copts stood together, side by side, and that since 25 January 2011, no Copt has been harassed and no church been trespassed. Finally, Egypt stated that Canada baselessly considered itself a custodian of human rights in the world. United Arab Emirates The UAE used its Right of Reply to respond to Iran's Right of Reply. The UAE stated that Iran was misleading the Assembly about its occupation of three islands belonging to the Emirates. It further stated that Iran's position on the issue was contrary to \\"all documentation and all historic, demographic and legal facts and realities,\\" which prove that the islands were an integral part of the territory of the United Arab Emirates. Furthermore, the UAE rejected Iranian occupation and all military and civilian measures taken on the islands in attempts to consolidate their occupation and circumvent the question of occupation. This rejection was based on the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the rules of international law. Finally, the UAE called upon the international community to urge Iran to enter into bilateral negotiations, or to pressure it into petitioning the International Court of Justice for its legal opinion on the matter. = 27 September 2011 = Morning schedule * ‚Äì Foreign Minister Hamady Ould Hamady * ‚Äì Foreign Minister Antonella Mularoni * ‚Äì Foreign Minister K.

Sri Lanka Sri Lanka used its Right of Reply to respond to statements made by Canada in its general debate speech before the Assembly. In its speech, Canada stated that the objectives of the United Nations were imperiled when its members observed its founding principles in word but not in deed. Such as when \\"objection is taken on petty, procedural or process-based grounds to reporting that speaks about credible allegations of war crimes committed in Sri Lanka.\\" Sri Lanka responded by stating that it was anguished by Canada's remarks, especially since it had made extensive efforts to keep the Canadian delegation to the Human Rights Council informed as to the reasons for Sri Lanka‚Äôs objections to the Canadian initiative on an interactive dialogue on the reconciliation commission process following the Sri Lankan Civil War. It further stated that in the United Nations system procedure and process are important to ensure good governance and equity, as well as to prevent the organization from being abused for narrow, domestic political advantage. Armenia Armenia used its Right of Reply to respond to statements made by Azerbaijan in its general debate speech before the Assembly. In its speech, Azerbaijan stated that Armenia was in violation of the United Nations Charter and other documents of international law by perpetrating aggression against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan. It then mentioned that Armenia was in violation of four separate Security Council resolutions that demanded Armenia withdraw from occupied Azerbaijani territory. Azerbaijan then stated that Armenia continued to publicly incite future generations to support violence, and that the implantation of ethnic Armenian settlers in Azerbaijan was another source of serious concern. Finally, it mentioned the findings of a visit of the OSCE Minsk Group in October 2010 that stated that the status quo of the occupation was unacceptable and urged Armenia to put an end to its illegal practices, it further urged the international community to convince Armenian to respect the generally accepted norms and principles of international law. Armenia responded by stating that the comments made by Azerbaijan were akin to cold war-style propaganda and that these statements were only made in an attempt to strengthen Azerbaijan's position in the efforts of the Minsk Group to find a comprehensive settlement to the Nagorno Karabakh issue. Armenia then said that Azerbaijan was preaching adherence to international law while taking it upon themselves to interpret the United Nations Charter, as well as statements made by Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan. It further accused Azerbaijan of misinterpreting the field assessment mission report of the Minsk Group in order to justify its militaristic rhetoric and move the discussions on the Nagorno Karabakh conflict to other forums. Armenia then stated that none of the Security Council resolutions mentioned by Azerbaijan contained a single word on Armenian aggression, nor do they mention withdrawal of Armenian military forces from Nagorno Karabakh. It then accused Azerbaijan of fabricating the number of refugees created by the conflict as 1 million as theses numbers could not be corroborated by any international organization, further accusing it of attempting to mislead the international community. Armenia finished by adding that it was intent on resolving the dispute through peaceful means. Azerbaijan Azerbaijan used its Right of Reply to respond to Armenia's Right of Reply. It began by stating that Armenia's statements displayed their disregard for its obligations under the Charter of the United Nations and international law. It then stated that it was ironic that Armenia would attempt to criticize Azerbaijan on notions of peace and human rights, when it was responsible for unleashing a war of aggression against Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan then called the so-called exercise of the right to self- determination by the Armenian ethnic minority living in Azerbaijan an illegal use of force against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan. It then accused the government of Armenia of purging ethnic non-Armenians out of its own territory, as well as the occupied areas of Azerbaijan under its control in an attempt to create a mono-ethnic culture. Azerbaijan also posited that increased attacks on Azerbaijani civilians and civilian objects, as well as an increase in hostile statements by the Armenian leadership posed a direct threat to the peace, security and stability of the region. It finished by stating that it was sure that Armenia‚Äôs destructive political agenda was fated to never be realized and that it would eventually be forced to establish civilized relations with all countries of the region.

Indian Women of Early Mexico It corresponds to the modern term Mesoamerica. History Tenochtitlan and islands in the Texcoco Lake. The Aztec people who came from Aztl√°n and settled in Tenochtitlan (today's Mexico City) called their land Cemanahuac, knowing their land was surrounded by the Pacific Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Caribbean Sea. The notion of Cemanahuac is also tied to the pyramid-driven philosophy of the Aztecs, their land sitting on top of a natural pyramid (chain of mountains of Central Mexico culminating in Tenochtitlan) the same way that Aztecs leaders sit on top of the Aztec pyramids (and the same way Aztec people engineered their social life). Tenochtitlan perfectly fit into this pyramidal paradigm, thus the association of the city to Cemanahuac. The city of Aztl√°n from which the Aztecs originated was also surrounded by water.  Definition  Cemanahuac is a Nahuatl name derived from the words \\"cƒì\\" one/whole and \\"ƒÄnƒÅhuac\\", which in turn derives from the words \\"atl\\" (water) and \\"nahuac\\", a locative meaning \\"circumvented or surrounded\\". Hence, the name can be literally translated as \\"land completely surrounded by water\\", or \\"[the] totality [of what is] next to water\\". The early Western literature on the Nahuatl culture and language agreed on the translation \\"world\\" for the term Cemanahuac. The term refers to the conscience that the Mexica had of the American territory they knew, surrounded by two great oceans, the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean.

The story was adapted by Andrew Davies as the BBC's sixth Ghost Story for Christmas, with Denholm Elliott starring as the signalman and Bernard Lloyd as the traveller, an unnamed character who acts as a plot device in place of the short story's narrator. It was the first episode of the series not to be an adaptation of an M.R. James story, and the last adaptation of an existing story. The production was directed by Lawrence Gordon Clark and filmed on the Severn Valley Railway. Plot summary A man (referred to as \\"The Traveller\\" in the cast list), observes from above the solitary figure of a signalman standing by the track in a railway cutting. Shielding his face from the sun with one arm, the traveller waves the other and calls down \\"Hallo, Below There\\". The signalman seems fearful and makes no attempt to speak to the traveller. Observing the man's demeanour, the traveller notes that the signalman appears to be afraid of him. Having reassured the signalman that there is nothing to fear, the traveller is welcomed into the lonely signal box. Seated in front of the fire, the two men talk about the signalman's work. Although his labour consists of a dull, monotonous routine, the signalman feels he deserves nothing better, because he wasted his academic opportunities when he was young. During their conversation, the signalman is repeatedly distracted by the ringing of his signal bell that only he can hear. The traveller remarks on the bell, and the red light at the entrance to the nearby tunnel, before changing the subject to how an accident in the tunnel must be a terrible thing. The signalman, slightly wide-eyed, tells him that a tunnel collision is the \\"worst to be feared\\". To comfort the disturbed man, the traveller says that he almost believes he has met a contented man at peace, because the signalman does his duty no matter what, and has no desire to be anywhere but his signal box. The traveller agrees to meet the man the next night when the signalman starts his shift. Holding his light so that the traveller can find his way back up the path, the signalman asks him not to call out. At the inn later that night, the traveller hears the faint whistling and puffing of a passing train before retiring to bed, and in his sleep, dreams of the signalman telling him not to call out and, even though he could not hear it at the time, of the bell making its vibrating ring, bathed in the red light of the signal at the tunnel entrance. The next evening, as the fog settles in, the traveller finds the signalman waiting for him. The signalman reveals the reason for his initial fear; the traveller's waving action and words mimic those of a ghostly spectre which rings his bell and is visible beside the red tunnel light. The spectre has appeared twice: firstly before a tunnel disaster, and then before a young bride fell to her death from a passing train. The signalman tells the traveller that the spectre had come back a week before and has appeared since in fits and starts, always by the light at the tunnel and always gesturing with one arm across its face and the other waved in warning. The frustrated signalman says that he has no rest or peace because of it, and that it calls out to him with an agonised shout of \\"Below There, Look Out, Look Out!\\", as well as waving and ringing the signal box bell. The signalman notes his dilemma; if he was to telegraph \\"danger\\" he would not be able to give any reason why and would surely be displaced or fired, so he feels powerless to prevent a possible calamity. The traveller tries to reassure him by telling him that there is nothing the signalman can do but discharge his duty, and he must remain calm. The signalman thanks the traveller for his advice and they agree to meet again. After a troubled sleep, the traveller goes to meet the signalman the following morning, but as he nears the cutting, a train approaches through the tunnel and the traveller realises he can hear the bell ringing. Running towards the scene, he attempts to warn the signalman, who is standing transfixed on the rail line beside the red light at the tunnel entrance. As the spectre reappears, the signalman is struck by the on-coming train. The engine driver tells the traveller that, as his locomotive came around a bend, he saw the signalman standing on the line. When the signalman did not heed the whistle, the driver shut it off and called out to him. The traveller asks what the driver said. Turning around and standing in front of the red light, the driver tells him that he called \\"Hallo, Below There, Look Out\\", with one hand covering his face and the other waving in warning, and continued to shout \\"Look Out, Look Out, For God Sake Clear The Way!\\". The traveller is horrified, because the actions of the driver are the same as those of the spectre that haunted the signalman. The traveller watches the crew carry the signalman's body away, before turning and heading back over the countryside in the thickening winter fog. Cast * Denholm Elliott as The Signalman * Bernard Lloyd as The Traveller * Reginald Jessup as The Engine Driver * Carina Wyeth as The Bride Adaptation The original short story may have been influenced by Dickens's own involvement with the Staplehurst rail crash in Kent on 9 June 1865. While passing over a viaduct, Dickens' train was derailed because some part of the track had been removed for maintenance. The cast iron viaduct fractured, causing most of the carriages to fall into the river below. Dickens was in the first carriage, which derailed sideways but did not fall completely. It was suspended at a precarious angle by the coupling of the coach in front and held up by the remains of the viaduct's masonry. Dickens helped rescue other passengers, and was commended for his actions, but the experience subsequently had a profound effect on his life. In The Signalman, adaptor Andrew Davies adds scenes of the traveller's nightmare- plagued nights at an inn, and re-affirms the ambiguity of the traveller- narrator by restructuring the ending, and by matching his facial features with those of the spectre.Rolinson, Dave, . Retrieved 2010-07-07. The film also makes use of visual and aural devices. For example, the appearance of the spectre is stressed by the vibrations of a bell in the signalbox, and the recurring red motif connects the signalman's memories of a train crash with the danger light attended by the ghostly figure. Davies also changes a number of elements for dramatic effect. For example, the bride does not fall out of the train but dies in one of the carriage compartments, and is merely referred to as \\"A Beautiful Young Lady\\". In the film, the traveller witnesses the signalman's demise, but in the short story, the narrator (the traveller's equivalent) comes the next day and encounters a railway inspector who informs him of the signalman's death. Production A replica Great Western Railway signal box was erected in the cutting on the Kidderminster side of Bewdley Tunnel, and Highley signal box was used for the interior shots. The signalman's speech about the tunnel accident, and its subsequent depiction, is likely a reference to the Clayton Tunnel crash that occurred during 1861, five years before Dickens wrote his short story. Reception The Signalman is perhaps the most critically acclaimed of the Ghost Story for Christmas adaptations. Simon Farquhar suggests that the film is the first evidence of Andrew Davies' gift as an adaptor of literary fiction: \\"despite an extremely arduous shoot, Davies and Clarke's fog-wreathed, flame-crackling masterpiece manages something the production team could never have imagined: it's better than the book.\\" Dave Rolinson notes that while \\"the adaptation inevitably misses Dickens' nuanced and often unsettling prose ... it achieves comparably skillful effects through visual language and sound, heightening theme and supernatural mood ... The production heightens the story's crucial features of repetition and foreshadowing.\\" References External links *The Signal- Man at bbc.co.uk. * * Category:BBC television dramas Category:British supernatural television shows Category:British ghost films Category:British films Category:Films based on short fiction Category:Films based on works by Charles Dickens ","title":"The Signalman (film)"},{"id":"33165094","title":"15th National Film Awards"},{"id":"33165099","text":"Jazink District () is a district (bakhsh) in Zehak County, Sistan and Baluchestan Province, Iran.

It is the seat of the Diocese of Sioux Falls. Since 1974 the cathedral has been a contributing property in the Cathedral Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places.The Cathedral Historic District was originally called the Sioux Falls Historic District. History Cathedral interior The Cathedral of St. Joseph traces its history to the establishment of St. Michael's Church, Sioux Falls' first Catholic parish. It was founded in 1881 and a wooden building was constructed for a church. Two years later a larger brick church was built. It became the Pro-Cathedral when Bishop Martin Marty, who was Vicar Apostolic of the Dakota Territory, arrived in Sioux Falls in 1889. On November 12, of the same year Pope Leo XIII established the Diocese of Sioux Falls, and St. Michael's become the cathedral for the new diocese. Bishop Thomas O'Gorman succeeded Bishop Marty in 1896 and in time desired a new and larger cathedral. He was a friend of Archbishop John Ireland of St. Paul and he attended the dedication of the Cathedral of St. Paul in 1915. He conferred with the architect of the new St. Paul cathedral Emmanuel Masqueray, who was hired to design the present cathedral in Sioux Falls. St. Michael's was moved and the rectory was torn down. Construction of the new cathedral was begun in 1915. Masqueray died in 1917 and shortages during World War I slowed construction. Edwin Lundie, Masqueray's chief assistant, took over the project. The first Mass in the unfinished cathedral took place on December 8, 1918 and it was dedicated after its completion on May 7, 1919. The structure has been altered over the years. A Kilgen pipe organ was installed in 1935. A fire in the lower church did significant damage to the cathedral in 1942. Conrad Schmitt Studios decorated the interior the following year, and the marble high altar and tester were installed in 1946. The frosted glass windows were replaced by French stenciled stained glass windows in 1947. A major interior restoration took place between 1970 and 1974. A new free-standing altar was installed at that time. In 2004 the Sacred Heart Chapel was created in the sacristy and the basement was renovated to become a parish hall. Another major renovation of the cathedral interior was completed in 2011.

Less precisely, this subgenre - works with the closed circle literary device - is simply known as the \\"classic\\", \\"traditional\\" or \\"cozy\\" detective fiction. It refers to a situation in which for a given crime (usually a murder), there is a quickly established, limited number of suspects, each with credible means, motive, and opportunity. In other words, it is known that the criminal (murderer) is one of the people present at or nearby the scene, and the crime could not have been committed by some outsider. The detective has to solve the crime, figuring out the criminal from this pool (circle) of suspects, rather than searching for a totally unknown perpetrator. This type of narrative originated with the British detective fiction. Agatha Christie's The Mysterious Affair at Styles (1920) has been credited as a work that started this trend. Other writers of that period, dating to the first half of the 20th century, a time known as the Golden Age of Detective Fiction (or more general, mystery fiction), reliant on the closed circle and related literary devices include Dorothy L. Sayers, G. K. Chesterton, Margery Allingham, Ngaio Marsh and Americans S. S. Van Dine and Ellery Queen. Those early closed circle mysteries preferred a common setting: a British country house. The country house was such a common element that it gave another name to what is essentially the same genre and the literary device, the \\"country house mystery\\". The persons involved were also commonly part of the upper class (generally the landed gentry) . Other settings than the country house are also possible, and many have been used in the closed circle mysteries even by Christie herself: a ship, a train, an island, and so on. Nonetheless, the requirements for this mystery enforce certain limitations on this genre, and make certain settings, particularly those that explain limited access outsiders would have, and characters with an upper class background - much more common than the others. The numbers of suspects vary, from a group as small as four or five, to all the passengers of a train, coach or wagon. After Second World War the closed circle mystery became less common, as other types of crime novels rose to prominence. Nonetheless other writers have continued to use this device till modern days, for example Rex Stout, Lucille Kallen, Cyril Hare, Jonathan Gash, Simon Brett. While the closed circle is a common device in literary fiction, it is a much less common occurrence in real world investigations.  Country house mystery  Examples of the \\"Country house mystery\\" from the Golden Age are: :And Then There Were None by Agatha Christie (on an island) :Death and the Dancing Footman by Ngaio Marsh (isolated by a snowstorm)  Other \\"Closed Circle... mysteries\\"  :Murder on the Orient Express by Agatha Christie (a stalled train in a snowdrift) :Death on the Nile by Agatha Christie (on a Nile river steamer) See also *Locked room mystery *Cluedo, a board game with a closed circle of suspects as its premise *Danganronpa, a visual novel video game franchise that takes the form of a collection of closed-circle murder-mysteries References Category:Detective fiction Category:Narrative techniques Category:Puzzles ","title":"Closed circle of suspects"},{"id":"33165152","text":"A courthouse facility dog (2014) In the United States, a courthouse facility dog is a professionally trained facility dog that has graduated from an accredited assistance dog organization that is a member of Assistance Dogs International. Such dogs assist crime victims, witnesses and others during the investigation and prosecution of crimes, as well as during other legal proceedings. Courthouse facility dogs also provide assistance to Drug Court and Mental Health Court participants during their recovery from drugs, alcohol, mental illness and posttraumatic stress disorder. In addition to the courthouse, these dogs work in child advocacy centers, district attorney offices, and law enforcement settings. The handlers of these dogs are professionals working in the legal system such as district attorneys, law enforcement officers, forensic interviewers, psychologists, social workers and victim advocates. Nonprofessional handlers are not utilized with courthouse facility dogs due to the confidential nature of some proceedings, and because the presence of lay people during the investigation of a crime and in the courtroom may create legal issues. Typical work * Greeting children and parents who have come into a child advocacy center to initiate investigation of child sexual abuse * Accompanying a child (age 4 ‚Äì 17) during a forensic interview, where the child explains to a trained interviewer the details of an incident of sexual abuse or a crime of violence * Accompanying a child during the various phases of the investigation and prosecution of crime, including a defense interview, a competency hearing, and a courtroom trial * Greeting members of the public throughout the courthouse * Attending drug court, mental health court, and other restorative justice proceedings to provide an element of calm to people with disabilities and individuals in drug withdrawal * Accompanying vulnerable adult crime victims, including rape victims, developmentally delayed adults, and the elderly during court proceedings * Providing emotional comfort to family members of homicide victims during the trial and sentencing of the offender * Providing a sense of normalcy during juvenile and family court proceedings. Training Courthouse facility dogs are usually bred, raised and trained by service dog organizations that are members of Assistance Dogs International, such as Canine Companions for Independence, Assistance Dogs of the West, and Support Dogs, Inc.. Facility dogs are not service dogs because they do not assist a person with a disability. Assistance Dogs International defines a facility dog and describes their training standards that must be maintained by their handlers who work as professionals in a specific setting. Most of these dogs are either golden or Labrador retrievers or a combination of the two breeds. These dogs have typically spent eighteen months being raised by a volunteer puppy raiser with weekly obedience classes and had six months or more of work with a professional dog trainer. During this time the organization‚Äôs trainers carefully assess which facility assistance dogs have the best temperament to work in a courthouse environment. A successful courthouse dog will have a quiet, calm demeanor and be self-confident. The dog will also need to be adaptable, highly social and work independently with many individuals throughout a typical day and have multiple handlers. In addition to the dog‚Äôs basic training, that should involve passing a public access test, the dog should be able to tolerate people wearing a variety of clothing from all walks of life, angry people, drug abusers, children who invade boundaries, erratic behavior, and emotionally charged situations. Most importantly, the dog should know when to engage with people in public and when to become almost invisible for extended periods of time during child forensic interviews and courtroom proceedings. The courthouse dog‚Äôs handler receives intensive training before graduating from the service dog organization with their dog. In order to protect the jurisdiction and handler of the dog should a lawsuit be filed, these dogs often carry a minimum of one million dollars in liability insurance. Many qualified dogs carry such policies as a part of the certification process, such as the courthouse facility dogs provided by Canine Companions for Independence. When courthouse facility dogs are off duty, they are beloved pets that live with their primary handlers. Legal status Although prosecuting attorneys, law enforcement officers, and victim advocates support the use of courthouse facility dogs in assisting crime victims and witnesses while they testify in court, some defense attorneys object to their use out of concern that it is prejudicial to their clients. The objection is usually based on the argument that the presence of the dog may make the prosecution witness more appealing to the jury. However, courthouse facility dogs are for everyone. If this type of dog is available and the witnesses can demonstrate to the judge that the presence of a courthouse dog would facilitate their ability to testify in court, then the dog should be made available to everyone including defendants. The National Crime Victim Law Institute suggests that this jury instruction regarding the presence of the dog in the courtroom be provided to the jurors before deliberations to overcome unfair prejudice to either the defense or prosecution. ‚ÄúTestifying in court is an unfamiliar and stressful event for most people; these dogs are used in a courthouse setting to help reduce witness anxiety and are available to any witness who requests one.‚Äù In the 2013 Washington state Supreme Court case State v Dye, the court found that it was not unduly prejudicial for facility dog Ellie who was trained by, and lives with, the prosecutor at Dye's trial. Addressing the possibility of biasing the jury with the use of the courthouse facility dog, the court found the following: ‚ÄúFurthermore, whatever subconscious bias may have befallen the jury was cured by the trial court's limiting instruction, which cautioned the jury not to \\"make any assumptions or draw any conclusions based on the presence of this service. Juries are presumed to follow instructions absent evidence to the contrary. State v. Kirkman, 159 Wn.2d 918, 928, 155 P.3d 125 (2007). No such evidence appears on the record here. The constitutional role of the jury prevents us from presuming-on the force of a bare allegation-that the jury \\"[made] a decision based on the dog's reaction and demeanor, not the witness's .... \\" Br. of Amicus Curiae Wash. Defender Ass'n & The Defender Ass'n at 14. And our own precedent compels us to respect the trial court's decision: whether or not we might have conducted the trial differently, we cannot say the trial court acted in a manifestly unreasonable manner.\\" History Firsts in using trained dogs to assist victims and witnesses in the criminal-justice system: * 2003: Jeeter, a golden Labrador retriever volunteer service dog, accompanied twin sisters into King County Superior Court during competency hearings and trial testimony. * 2004: Canine Companions for Independence became the first assistance dog organization to place a facility dog (Ellie, a Labrador retriever mix) to work in a prosecutor‚Äôs office, in Seattle. * 2013: Rosie, a graduate facility dog from assistance dog organization ECAD was placed with Poughkeepsie Children's Home to assist a child who had to testify against her father in State v. Tohom. * 2018: Duo, an assistance dog organization, made the first facility dog (Oliver, Labrador retriever mix) placement in Europe. Oliver is also the first facility dog in the world to be placed at a university (Canterbury Christ Church University, UK). Notable events in the establishment of organizations and legislature centered around the use of courthouse facility dogs: * 2012: The Courthouse Dogs Foundation was founded, which is a nonprofit organization advocating for and educating about the use of courthouse facility dogs. * April, 2015: Arkansas became the first state to pass a bill allowing child witnesses to testify with certified facility dogs in court. * July, 2015: Illinois became the second state to pass a measure allowing facility dogs to accompany child witnesses and developmentally challenged adults during testimony in court. * May, 2016: Arizona became the third state to allow child witnesses to testify with a courthouse facility dog. * June, 2016: Hawaii became the fourth state to allow child witnesses to testify with a courthouse facility dog. * June 2017 Alabama passed SB273 Koda's Law allowing equal access and Courthouse privileges for Therapy dogs and Facility dogs to accompany witnesses in court. Facility dogs may be trained through Any assistance dogs organization . * January 2018: The Justice Support Dogs International Lab was founded by Dr Elizabeth Spruin. The Lab was established to prompt the use of facility dogs in the UK Criminal Justice System and to help build an evidence base for these practices. Since 2003, the use of courthouse facility dogs has spread throughout the United States and internationally.

Healthgrades has amassed information on over 3 million U.S. health care providers. The company was founded by Kerry Hicks, David Hicks, Peter Fatianow, John Neal, and Sarah Lochran, and is based in Denver, Colorado. Rob Draughon serves as the company's CEO. According to USA Today, Healthgrades is the first comprehensive physician rating and comparison database. The application is part of a trend in health technology in the United States towards consumer-driven healthcare. History Kerry Hicks founded Healthgrades in 1998. Prior to founding Healthgrades, Hicks served as CEO of its predecessor company, Specialty Care Network. In 2008, Healthgrades acquired Ailjor, an online healthcare directory. Healthcare providers had the ability to display their business information on the website for the community to view. In 2009, Healthgrades worked with over 400 hospitals in the United States. An affiliate of Vestar Capital Partners, a private equity firm, acquired Healthgrades in 2010. Healthgrades merged with CPM Marketing Group, a Madison, Wisconsin based company that provides customer relationship management solutions to hospitals. CPM Marketing became CPM Healthgrades, a division of Healthgrades, and now operates as Healthgrades Hospital Solutions group. The merger created a single online company with more than 200 million visitors annually. In October 2014, Healthgrades launched the first comprehensive physician rating and comparison database in the United States. The database allows users to search for physicians based on their experience in a particular area or procedure. The database's launch coincided with the release of a company-produced report that showed widely varying complication rates for total knee replacement surgeries across 17 Denver-area hospitals. Ratings Healthgrades evaluates hospitals solely on risk adjusted mortality and in-hospital complications. Its website evaluates roughly 500 million claims from federal and private reviews and data to rate and rank doctors based on complication rates at the hospitals where they practice, experience, and patient satisfaction. Its analysis is based on approximately 40 million Medicare discharges for the most recent three-year time period available. Hospital rating reports for specific procedures and diagnoses are compiled primarily from Medicare claim data, and include all hospitals that are Medicare participants. Some critics argue that claim data is not adequate enough to make determinations about the quality of care and that conclusions should be drawn from medical records. Peer-reviewed research has shown that measures of mortality and complication rates based on administrative data can be used as a measure of clinical quality. Ratings are updated yearly, but data is two years old before Medicare releases it.\\"Healthgrades\\" Palmetto Health, facility evaluations Healthgrades develops objective ratings based on data and information obtained from several sources, mostly available to the public. The data is analyzed using a proprietary methodology that identifies the recipients of the various awards and the \\"1-3-5 Star\\" designation.\\"Healthgrades vs. Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital\\" US District Court files, June 19, 2009 Specifically, most ratings are determined from multivariate logistic regressions of medical outcomes at a given healthcare provider to risk-adjust the patients and 1-, 3- and 5-star awards are given to providers whose negative outcomes are worse than expected, near predicted levels, and better than expected, respectively. The ratings have been criticized for oversights in the methodology that may actually penalize some institutions with ideal medical outcomes. Nash et al. have expressed \\"concern about the reliability and validity of such 'black box' rating scales.\\" In addition to star ratings, Healthgrades recognizes facilities for: America's 50 and 100 Best Hospitals, Distinguished Hospitals for Clinical Excellence, and Excellence Awards in 26 areas. The Clinical Excellence awards bestowed by Healthgrades are intended to help patients make an informed choice about where to get treated. Products =Website= Time listed the Healthgrades website as one of its 50 best websites of 2011. The information Healthgrades provides includes information on doctors' board certifications, types of procedures offered, and which insurance plans offices accept. However, information such as healthcare provider degrees is often inaccurate on the site, significantly limiting its use and raising concern that other information on the site may also be incorrect. It also lists a doctor's hospital affiliations and information on hospital performance collected from government data. Web visitors can input their opinions in a survey based on their experience with an individual health care professional, and view provider ratings at no charge. The survey evaluates a doctor's communication skills, the friendliness of the office staff, and whether it's easy to get an urgent appointment. Healthgrades was featured in a study analyzing the trends of online ratings of otolaryngologists that was published in JAMA in 2014. The study confirmed that although physician's feelings toward the presence of online rating websites tend to be negative, the awareness of and the use of them by patients has increased and may actually help physicians manage their online reputation. According to comScore, Healthgrades began receiving approximately 17 million unique visitors a month in January 2014. Many companies and health plans make Healthgrades information available to their participants.\\"Profile of Kerry Hicks\\" Walkers Research Healthgrades also owns the website, BetterMedicine.com.Shapiro, Scott: \\"Healthgrades Evaluates Hospital Emergency Medicine for the First Time\\" Healthgrades press release, June 23, 2010 =Licensing= Hospitals that are highly rated providers will license Healthgrades' ratings and trademarks to use in their marketing promotions. The company uses litigation to protect its name and ratings. Healthgrades sued the Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in 2006 for copyright and trademark infringement after the hospital used Healthgrades' ratings and logo in promotional publications without paying licensing fees. =Consulting= Healthgrades provides consulting services to more than 350 hospitals for recommendations on how to preserve or improve their quality of care, as well as marketing and business development.\\"Healthgrades\\" Hoovers Business Intelligence, Company profiles Independent evaluation Medical experts have questioned the reliability of the 1-, 3- and 5-star ratings given to healthcare providers, criticizing the lack of transparency and perceived oversights in Healthgrades' methodology. A study published in JAMA in 2002 reported that Healthgrades ratings for mortality associated with acute myocardial infarction identified \\"groups of hospitals differing in the aggregate in quality of care and outcomes\\" but heterogeneity within the ratings for individual hospitals could not reliably discriminate between individual hospitals in quality of care or mortality. Editorial comment: Letters: To illustrate: for any pair of hospitals rated to two different rating groups (1-, 3- or 5-star) by Healthgrades, the researchers determined that standardized mortality rates were \\"comparable or even better in the lower-rated hospital in more than 90% of the comparisons.\\" The Rocky Mountain News concluded that Healthgrades had inaccurate physician disciplinary records (while competitor ChoicePoint had much greater accuracy) in 2004. The report also detailed the complaints of former Healthgrades employees and physicians that pursued legal actions after inaccurate reports. Research published in Journal of the American College of Surgeons in 2010, compared mortality in US News and World Report and Healthgrades lists of \\"Best Hospitals\\" for abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, coronary artery bypass, aortic valve repair and mitral valve repair. Risk-adjusted mortality was found to be statistically significantly lower in the Healthgrades' \\"Best Hospitals\\" for coronary artery bypass and aortic valve repair. A similar study published in Archives of Surgery in 2011 evaluated Healthgrades and US News & World Report ratings in oncologic surgeries, comparing top-rated hospitals in the two reports to all other U.S. hospitals. Invited critique: The authors determined that both ratings systems had substantive flaws in the evaluation of mortality following pancreatectomy, esophagectomy or colectomy; only the top rated hospitals for colectomy in the US News & World Report ratings had a statistically significant lower mortality than national averages‚Äîmortality rates at Healthgrades' best hospitals were not significantly lower for any of the three procedures. Criticism  In 2010, AOL criticized the company for its use of \\"automatic renewal\\" subscription charges to customers who purchased physician reports. Healthgrades discontinued all consumer-based credit card product offerings in 2011. ConsumerAffairs.com shows an unfavorable rating of Healthgrades.com, listing allegations of inaccurate healthcare provider information, modified or falsified reviews left by consumers, and an inability to properly validate reviews prior to being posted.Consumer Complaints & Reviews: Healthgrades A 2016 article published in Consumer Reports identified a case where Healthgrades failed to divulge 18 malpractice suits against Leonard Kurian, a physician reviewed on its site, bringing into question the quality of reviews it provides. Healthgrades will disable and remove therapy and psychology accounts if requested.

Residential Genealogy has two main facets: ‚Ä¢ Discovering the genealogy of a particular home, building, or land through history. Identifying the owners of a house throughout its lifetime is a good example of a singular vertical historical search. It's not necessarily a ‚Äúwho slept here‚Äù endeavor but a ‚Äúwho owned this‚Äù question. ‚Ä¢ A more common, personal approach is to find out where your ancestors lived and owned property. Being landed gentry has been a goal of people throughout history. So this residential genealogy is more related to researching family names and places and finding out what property was owned. It can be quite exciting to see your family name on a historical map from the 1700s. Residential Genealogy is of interest to history buffs, genealogy searchers, and real estate agents. Anyone who has ever lived in an older home has, at some point, wondered who the earlier occupants might have been. Even if they live in a modern home, they may also wonder how their neighborhood evolved: which homes were built when, and the progression of neighboring streets. Residential Genealogy also shows ghost towns, and what was in a place before reservoirs, cemeteries, etc. This research usually requires a collection of 19th- and early 20th-century American city, town, and county maps. The detailed maps, usually Cadastral Maps show every building and every street in each city or town. Each single-dwelling home contains the name of the family who resided there, either on or beside the building on the map. Apartment complexes contained the property owner's name. Other research tools are antique city directories, census records and phone books which enhance the ability of researchers to trace not only the history of any location but also the people in these locations back in time. If your research is online, finding a specific historic home or building can be easy, as map collections are linked with modern mapping technology that references existing street names and numbers. By simply typing in an address, users can follow the progression of buildings and neighborhoods through time-in some cases up to 250 years. Like modern digital maps, these online historic maps are extremely detailed and comprehensive, showing the location and footprint of nearly all structures of the period.

He employed 32 people and owned 11 trucks, referred to as coaches. The Twincoach Helm's bakery truck, with its recognized two-tone custom paint job, is on display at the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles. The building, and Helms' actual desk, straddles the city line between Culver City and Los Angeles. Business operations Helms Bakery was an enormous operation. It was at its height in the 1950s with 950 sales routes as far north as Fresno and as south as San Diego. The list of baked goods topped 150 items and he had 1,850 employees. Helms Bakeries were turning out more than a million loaves of bread a day, all home-delivered by the Helms Bakery trucks.

Helms won a first-of-its-kind contract to supply the breads to be served at the men's Olympic Village in Baldwin Park. Four years later, in time for the 1936 Summer Olympics, Germany asked Helms for his bread recipes to feed to the German Olympic team. His relationship with Olympians continued in later years; the U.S. teams at London and Helsinki requested his bread be served. He incorporated the idea of the Official Olympic Bread into his company logo, placed on his factory signs and painted it on all of his coaches. His slogan was \\"Olympic Games Bakers ‚Äì Choice of Olympic Champions\\". =\\"The First Bread on the Moon\\"= On July 16, 1969, Apollo 11 had liftoff to make the first moon landing and then return to earth as per President Kennedy's objective.

The Helms champion, for the years in which the NIT and NCAA post-season tournaments were played, reflected the winners of the 1938 NIT and 1939 NIT, as well as the winners for all years of the NCAA Tournament except for 1939, 1940, 1944 and 1954. The Foundation ceased giving a player-of-the-year award after Larry Bird during the 1978‚Äì79 season. The organization existed until 1982 to make selections for All-America teams and national championships in college football and college basketball. All selections were made by Schroeder.

It first opened in 1971, and in the words of The New York Times, ‚Äúcreated a scene that would influence music for decades to come.‚Äù In the nearly sixteen years the club was open before it closed in 1987, My Father‚Äôs Place presented more than 6,000 shows from over 3,000 diverse artists. Its owner Michael ‚ÄúEppy\\" Epstein refused to book cover bands, and so the club became known as a place aspiring artists could perform. Young unknown musicians such as Billy Joel, Bruce Springsteen, Madonna, Aerosmith, The Police, Tom Petty, as well as hopeful comics Billy Crystal, Eddie Murphy, and Andy Kaufman, and a host of others graced the stage. In the summer of 2018 Epstein opened a new version of the club in a location not far from the original venue, in the newly renovated Roslyn Hotel (formerly the Roslyn Claremont Hotel). History The venue was located on 19 Bryant Avenue in Roslyn and was formerly a car dealership, funeral parlor, bakery and bowling alley named Roslyn Bowl. In the wake of the AMF Bowling boom of the early 1960s, Roslyn Bowl was nearly out of business. To compete, the Roslyn Bowl‚Äôs owner, Jay Linehan, began booking country music acts to turn the bowling alley into a music venue and promoted the new venture as the largest dance floor on Long Island. At the suggestion of Linehan‚Äôs son, the Roslyn Bowl changed its name to My Father‚Äôs Place. That same year, Eppy Epstein (born November 11, 1947) and Richie Hersh (born August 19, 1948) had opened a head shop in Roslyn, Never When, but was not allowed by the village to convert it into a coffee shop. Epstein and Hersh turned to Linehan and offered to book My Father‚Äôs Place with rock acts. Richie Havens opened the first show at My Father‚Äôs Place on May 31, 1971 to a sold out audience. Epstein turned to radio to promote the club and by 1972 had forged a ground- breaking deal with local radio station WLIR to broadcast concerts from the club. Many of these broadcasts have subsequently become highly sought-after bootleg recordings. WLIR, in turn, would become one of the most influential radio stations in the country under its revolutionary program director, Denis McNamara, by creating the format \\"alternative radio\\". Unlike most other clubs that highlighted one genre or one particular era of music, the variety of My Father‚Äôs Place was possibly its most important trait. The club debuted in America most of reggae‚Äôs biggest stars, helping to make the genre mainstream. Along with CBGB and Max‚Äôs Kansas City, My Father‚Äôs Place was a nurturing ground for young punk and new wave acts like The Runaways, The Ramones, Blondie, The Police, and Talking Heads. Country, bluegrass, and blues artists like Charlie Daniels, Linda Ronstadt, and Stevie Ray Vaughn performed early in their careers, while legends like James Brown, B.B. King, and Bo Diddley played in the twilight of theirs. Development pressures led to the village of Roslyn closing down the club on May 3, 1987, with a final performance by the band Tower of Power.

For a few years it was the preferred car for senior political and military personnel in Czechoslovakia. It was never sold to the general public. Background In 1949 the plant at Mlad√° Boleslav assembled the last ≈†koda Superbs, large six- cylinder limousines evoking the style of American cars in the late 1930s. The authorities needed a more modern replacement and instructed ≈†koda to develop one. This was the car that would become the ≈†koda VOS.

The car The car went into production in 1950 with the coach builder (even then better known as a producer of buses) Karosa: final assembly took place at ≈†koda‚Äôs own plant. The form of the car was unremarkable, despite having been designed by Oldrich Meduna whose reputation till that point came from his work designing military tanks. The mechanical architecture was also conventional, with a front-mounted engine driving the rear wheels. More remarkable, at least in terms of European cars of the time, was a large 5.2-litre engine delivering . The engine came from a Praga truck. Because of the weight of the armour plating, the standard car weighed nearly 4 tons, however. The top speed was restricted to 80 km/h (50 mph) on the orders of the interior ministry. A ‚ÄúLight-weight‚Äù version without all the armour plating was also listed. Unusually for the time, the car was fitted with air-conditioning. However, the air conditioning mechanism occupied most of the space in the boot/trunk, and it became common for dignitaries moving by VOS to travel followed by a second car to carry luggage. Celebrity connections Famous owners included President Gottwald, Enver Hoxha, Zhu De, Ana Pauker and Mao Zedong. Ana Pauker, the infamous female communist leader of the Romanian Workers' Party (later to become the Romanian Communist Party ) had a ≈†koda VOS built for running on tracks, reaching speeds of up to 115 km/h with a total weight of 5 tons.

After their formation they released their first EP Cheap Tricks and Theatrics in 2009. A self-titled EP followed several months later in 2010. The band's debut studio album, Best Kind of Mess, was released on July 12, 2011. Following Nicholas Matthews' first departure to join Blacklisted Me, the band released Cheap Tricks and Theatrics B-Sides on December 19, 2011, without any previous announcements. Matthews was replaced by Joel Faviere near the end of 2011. The band's third EP and first with Faviere, Built for Blame, Laced With Shame, was released in 2012; Faviere was kicked out a few months after the EP's release when Matthews rejoined the band. Following Matthews' comeback, the band signed with Fearless Records and released their second full-length album, Everyone's Out To Get Me, on November 11, 2013. The band's third studio album, Demons, was released on October 30, 2015, and marked a departure from the band's post-hardcore sound featured on Built for Blame and Everyone's Out to Get Me in favor of a more metalcore-like sound. Their fourth and final album, The Dead Days, was released on April 19, 2019 amidst a hiatus; it was later stated by vocalist Nicholas Matthews that the band had broken up due to multiple issues between the band members. History =Early years, Best Kind of Mess and Built for Blame, Laced With Shame (2008‚Äì2013)= Before forming the band, Nicholas Matthews, Johnny Braddock, Bradley Iverson and Warren Wilcock were all in separate bands. The four came together to form the band and self-released their first EP, Cheap Tricks and Theatrics.

The band postponed any touring dates until further notice due to the sudden departure and lack of a lead vocalist. In the same message, they also announced that they would be holding auditions for lead vocalist. The band re-entered the studio with the new lead vocalist on December 28. Although it was not officially announced who the new vocalist was, at the time there was much speculation that former Dear Chandelier singer Joel Faviere replaced Matthews, due to the tweets sent by Faviere and some of the members of Get Scared on Twitter. It was later made official that Faviere was the new lead vocalist. The team also welcomed new guitarist Adam Virostko to the band that following September 2012 to play The Pizza Party Tour with Dead Rabbits.

History During the early part of the Renaissance, this monastery was known for the high-quality manuscripts and other works created by its scriptorium. Many of the illuminations from these works are found in museum collections around the world. The bulk of an exhibition of illuminated art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in 1995 consisted of the illustrations cut out from manuscripts produced by this monastery Strongly tied to most powerful families of Florentine society, the monks took part in the artistic flourishing in the city in that era, and they were able to produce works in the High Gothic art of the Sienese School. Additionally, the greatest artists of the city worked to decorate the monastery. Among them was Nardo di Cione. It was in this monastery that the famed artist, Lorenzo Monaco (Lorenzo the Monk), entered monastic life. He kept this title, despite the fact that he chose not to take religious vows as a monk, and returned to secular life. Even after his departure, Lorenzo continued to contribute to the beautification of the monastery with his art. Monks executed a variety of tasks and obligations which took place throughout the year. Among these was a lengthy and solemn procession, held on specific feast days, that took the community to every altar and altarpiece in the monastic complex. The route they took and the images they saw caused each monk to see this collection of images in sequence, and thus encouraged him to consider the altarpieces both individually and collectively. The culmination of this procession came to be the extraordinary high altarpiece produced by Lorenzo Monaco in 1413, the Coronation of the Virgin, which summarized the entire program of monastic imagery.

The story follows the experiences of a bunch of actors as they attempt to make an ultimately inept and poor quality film. A sequel, Le Fear II: Le Sequel, is due to be released in 2016.

The house is an unusual example of post-and-beam construction in a region where stone or brick construction is more usual. The house is a 2-1/2 story post-and-beam framed structure on a stone foundation and basement. The frame is infilled with brick nogging and covered with weatherboarding. The weatherboards are covered with stucco. The main block is three bays with a small entry porch supported by Tuscan columns. A one-story frame addition extends to the west. The interior was originally arranged on a side-passage plan, which has since been altered. The house features extensive wainscoting. The main parlor features full-height paneling. A second wing was added in 1984. The stucco is believed to have been installed in the 1930s or 1940s. A dining room is also accessed from the side hall. The second floor of the main house has two bedrooms. The property includes three contributing outbuildings: a smokehouse, springhouse and barn.

It is named after the Gauja River, where it is exposed along the banks.  Description  The Gauja Formation has a maximum thickness of . It is composed of weakly to moderately cemented layers of fine-grained to very fine-grained sandstone. The layer is predominantly light to yellowish-gray in color, but can be pinkish brown or variegated. It is mostly composed of quartzose arenites. It is overlain by the thick Amata Formation and the Plavinas Formation. The Gauja Formation contains two cyclic members. The lower layers are known as the Sietin Member and are composed mostly of sandstone with a thin layer of siltstone at the top. It has yielded numerous fossils of fishes. Among them are Asterolepis, Bothriolepis, Glyptolepis baltica, Laccognathus panderi, Livoniana multidentata,Ahlberg et al., 2000 and Megadonichthys kurikae. The upper layers are thicker, and the lower part of it is known as the Lode Member. The Lode Member dates from the Middle Devonian and is composed of light colored sandstone. The area is indicative of a near- shore environment of retreating sea. Only large plant remains and miospores are known from this member. Examples of which include Hostinella, Archaeopteris, Retusotriletes rugulatus, and Ancyrospora. Palynological studies indicate that the Middle to Upper Devonian boundary may exist in this member.

AFWG, in addition to its research, undertakes capacity building to help prepare a new generation of scholars in Palestine, Lebanon, and Egypt; works with NGO‚Äôs and stakeholders to exchange research findings; and works to transform their research into policy briefs and papers for NGO‚Äôs and policy makers working with Arab families and youth. They also are committed to translating their relevant works into Arabic to make their findings of use to the local public. Encyclopedia of Women and Islamic Cultures Joseph founded the Encyclopedia of Women and Islamic Cultures (EWIC) project and is its general editor. EWIC is a six-volume interdisciplinary, transhistorical encyclopaedia, published between 2002 and 2007, that examines the experiences of Muslim women globally as well as non- Muslim women in Islamic societies. Middle East Section of the American Anthropological Association Joseph is the founder of the Middle East Research Group in Anthropology, which later evolved into the Middle East Section (MES) of the American Anthropological Association. MES brings together anthropologists with an interest in the peoples, cultures, and histories of the Middle East. Its membership is international, composed of anthropologists from diverse subdisciplines including sociocultural anthropology, medical anthropology, and archeology. As such, according to the website, MES is ‚Äúuniquely poised to contribute to establishing and promoting public understanding and policy frameworks that accommodate the historical experience and sociocultural diversity of the peoples of the Middle East.‚Äù MES scholars convene annually at the conference of the American Anthropological Association. The Association for Middle East Women‚Äôs Studies Joseph is the founder of the Association for Middle East Women‚Äôs Studies (AMEWS) and co- founder of the Journal of Middle East Women's Studies. AMEWS is an organization of scholars and individuals with an interest in women and gender studies in the context of the Middle East, North Africa, including their diasporic communities. AMEWS works to organize and sponsor conferences, workshops and symposia that encourage research and collaboration in these areas. AMEWS is affiliated with the Middle East Studies Association of North America. It produces the Journal of Middle East Women's Studies (JMEWS), which is published triennially by Indiana University Press. According to their website, JMEWS is \\"a venue for region-specific research informed by transnational feminist, gender, and sexuality scholarship,\\" and encourages editors to submit work \\"that employs historical, ethnographic, literary, textual, and visual analyses and methodologies.\\" Middle East/South Asia Studies Program, UC Davis Joseph is the Founding Director of the Middle East/South Asia Studies Program (ME/SA) at the University of California, Davis (2004‚Äì2009). ME/SA meets the growing demand of students for courses to develop their understanding of this critical region. Originally launched as an undergraduate minor program, ME/SA won a substantial grant from the U.S. Department of Education in 2006 enabling it to add new courses including Arabic and Hindi/Urdu instruction, sponsor conferences and lectures, and launch a K-12 teacher training workshop. In the Fall of 2008, ME/SA launched its undergraduate Major, and by 2010, it had 30 affiliated faculty members, 20 teaching faculty members, and offered over 80 courses.http://mesa.ucdavis.edu By 2011, ME/SA had won an endowment for a Visiting Lecturer from the PARSA Community Foundation to launch Iranian studies. ME/SA will offer a minor in Iranian Studies by 2014. In 2011 ME/SA also won a donor gift to assist in the development of an Arab Studies minor which it also plans to launch by 2014. Joseph led both of these efforts. According to the website, ‚ÄúAs the only University of California campus with a minor and major in Middle East/South Asia Studies, UC Davis is a pioneer in the study of the Middle East and South Asia in relationship to each other.‚Äùhttp://mesa.ucdavis.edu/about-us American University of Beirut, American University in Cairo, Lebanese American University , University of California, Davis and Birzeit University Consortium Joseph is the facilitator of the American University of Beirut, American University in Cairo, Lebanese American University, University of California, Davis and Birzeit University Consortium, which she founded in 2011. The five-university consortium organizes collaborative research among the scholars at these universities.

Linn (n√©e Cyrog) is a professor of development and cognition specializing in education in mathematics, science, and technology in the Graduate School of Education at the University of California, Berkeley. Since 1970 she has made significant contributions to the understanding of how computers and technology can be used to support learning and teaching in mathematics and science. Her CV includes an extensive list of presentations and published books, articles, and peer reviewed papers in science education and education technology. Many of Marcia's published works can be accessed at http://telscenter.org/publications and by searching for \\"Linn, Marcia\\" at http://www.eric.ed.gov/ Family Linn was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin to Frances and George Cyrog. Frances became the principal of Sorenson School in Whittier, California. George was a supervisor in the postal service as well as a rockhound who founded the Whittier Gem and Mineral Society. Marcia's lifelong interest in science learning stems from growing up as the oldest child in a family enthusiastic about learning. Her father, George, believed everyone could learn about all aspects of science and engineering and implemented this in his hobby of collecting rocks and minerals. Her mother, Frances, developed a philosophy for individualized reading instruction starting when she taught elementary school and continuing as she became an elementary school principal. Education Linn received a B.A. in psychology and statistics (1965), an M. A. in educational psychology (1967), and a Ph.D. in Educational Psychology (1970) from Stanford University working under the mentorship of Lee Cronbach. Her research addresses how technology-enhanced curricula, visualizations, and assessments can deepen student understanding of science. In 1967-68, Linn worked with Jean Piaget and other researchers at the Institute Jean Jacques Rousseau in Geneva, Switzerland. In Geneva, listening to researchers probe students' ideas motivated her to listen closely to the ideas that students bring to a learning situation. Linn spent time in schools interviewing students and learning to conduct interviews using the Piagetian clinical method. In Geneva, and when she returned to California, Linn conducted many interviews in which she asked students to explore scientific problems. She learned that student ideas about scientific topics are diverse and often well connected. These interviews formed the basis for her perspective on knowledge integration. Academic career Linn was a Research Psychologist at the Lawrence Hall of Science (1970‚Äì1987) and led the ACCEL program, a National Science Foundation-funded research project that investigated the cognitive consequences of computer environments for learning. She won an Apple Wheels for the Mind grant in 1985 for The Computer as Lab Partner, a project to bring Apple computers equipped with sensing probes into schools. With Robert Tinker, she developed the first Microcomputer-based Labs and probeware for middle school science. In 1983 she was Fulbright Professor at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel. In 1983 she won one of two grants awarded by the National Institute of Education to study the emerging role of technology in education. This project, Assessing the Cognitive Consequences of Computer Environments for Learning, documented the early uses of personal computers in classrooms. In 1986 she received a three- year grant from the National Science Foundation to study Autonomous Learning Materials for Pascal Courses and studied programming instruction as an approach to learning complex problem-solving skills. Common themes emerging in her research studying how students learn computer science and middle school science led her to describe the knowledge integration framework (see summary in Linn, 1995 NSF publication). From 1989 to 1996 Marcia was director of the Instructional Technology Program at the UC Berkeley. She was responsible for introducing and encouraging innovative university teaching using multimedia and education technologies. In 1995‚Äì1996, 2001‚Äì2002, and 2010-2011, Linn was a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in Behavioral Sciences in Stanford, California. In 2008-2009 she was President of the International Society for the Learning Sciences . Linn is a member of the National Academy of Education and a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Psychological Association, and the Association for Psychological Science. She has served as Chair of the AAAS Education Section and as President of the International Society of the Learning Sciences. Board service includes the American Association for the Advancement of Science board, the Graduate Record Examination Board of the Educational Testing Service, the James S. McDonnell Foundation Cognitive Studies in Education Practice board, and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources at the National Science Foundation. Linn's books include Computers, Teachers, Peers (2000), Internet Environments for Science Education (2004), Designing Coherent Science Education (2008), WISE Science (2009), and Science Learning and Instruction: Taking Advantage of Technology to Promote Knowledge Integration (2011). Awards include the National Association for Research in Science Teaching Award for Lifelong Distinguished Contributions to Science Education and the Council of Scientific Society Presidents first award for Excellence in Educational Research.

He is chiefly remembered as a possible ancestor of the 1st Duke of Wellington.  Early life  Despite his family's later eminence, Robert's background is obscure and his early life is poorly recorded. He is the father of Walter Cowley of Glaston in Rutland; the Colley/Cowley family is recorded there from about 1400. Robert is said to have seen military service with Garret Mor, the \\"Great\\" Earl of Kildare, but the first definite trace of him is when he entered Lincoln's Inn in 1502.Kenny, Colum The Kings Inns and the Kingdom of Ireland Irish Academic Press Dublin, 1992 p.19 He then decided on a business career abt 1505 with his sons Walter & Robert (Jr), and moved to Dublin where he became a successful merchant. He was made Bailiff of Dublin in 1515.Ball F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221‚Äì1921 John Murray London 1926 Vol.1 p.203  Political and judicial career  From about 1520 Cowley played an increasing role in Irish politics. He was in the retinue of the Earl of Surrey when he was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. In 1522 when Piers Butler, 8th Earl of Ormond replaced Surrey as Lieutenant, Cowley became his legal adviser and Clerk to the Council in 1525; thereafter the Cowley family were regarded as strong Ormond partisans.Ball p.203 Robert also sought to gain influence by becoming a regular correspondent of Cardinal Wolsey and later of Thomas Cromwell. James Bathe, later Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer and a trusted Crown servant for thirty years, faced Cowley's hostility from early in his career.√ì Math√∫na, Sean P. William Bathe 1564-1614- a Pioneer in Linguistics John Benjamins 1986 p.9 In 1525 Bathe, then a very young lawyer, presented the English Government with a book setting out his proposals for reform of the Irish administration: Cowley ridiculed it, writing to Wolsey that Bathe knew as much about the government of Ireland as Cowley did about that of Italy.√ì Math√∫na p.9 =Feud with Patrick Barnewall= In the 1530s Robert and his brother Walter Cowley engaged in a power struggle with Patrick Barnewall, the Irish Solicitor General, who also had considerable influence with Cromwell. The Cowleys, who had the reputation for being entirely unscrupulous in advancing their careers, kept up a flow of letters to Cromwell attempting to undermine Barnewall.Hart, A.C., The History of the King's Serjeants-at-Law in Ireland Four Court Press Dublin 2000 p.34 They alleged that Barnewall had challenged the King's authority in religious matters, a very serious charge in the political climate of the time. For a time it seemed the Cowleys would oust Barnewall: Cowley obtained the offices of Clerk of the Crown and Receiver of Customs of the port of Dublin, and Cromwell praised him as a man of long established fidelity and truth, an opinion with which few others, then or since, have ever agreed.Ball, p.203 Barnewall at one point offered to surrender the office of Solicitor General for Ireland to Walter Cowley. In the event Cromwell seems to have made peace between the rivals: Barnewall remained Solicitor General and a new post of Principal Solicitor for Ireland was created for Walter. Robert became Master of the Rolls in 1539. He served on the commission for suppression of the religious houses and received as his reward the priory of Holmpatrick, near Dublin.  Last years  Cowley's influence declined after the downfall and death of Cromwell in 1540: Henry VIII distrusted him, and like many leading political figures of the Pale he quarrelled with Sir Anthony St. Leger, the Lord Deputy of Ireland. His efforts to block the rise to power of Chief Baron Bathe were entirely unsuccessful, even though he pointed out, correctly, that many of Bathe's friends and relatives had been deeply involved in the Rebellion of Silken Thomas. In 1541 Cowley unwisely went to London without official leave: he was promptly denounced for sedition, imprisoned in the Fleet Prison and deprived of office. He was released from the Fleet in 1543 and died in England three years later.Ball p. 203 His son Walter was also deprived of office and imprisoned in the Tower of London ‚Äì several letters from him to the King pleading for clemency still exist.State Papers for the Reign of Henry VIII Vol. III published 1834  Character  Cowley was a gifted man who rose from obscurity to found one of the great Anglo-Irish families; but as a man he was not highly regarded by his contemporaries, or by later historians. His letters to Cromwell, particularly those which detail his efforts to destroy Patrick Barnewall, show him in an unattractive light, and historians have described both Robert and Walter as \\"ambitious mischief-makers\\".Hart p.30  Descendants  Although Walter Cowley, Principal Solicitor for Ireland, is recorded as Robert's brother he was in fact Roberts son.

Cochran, The distribution of the largest of a set of estimated variances as a fraction of their total, Annals of Human Genetics (London) 11(1), 47‚Äì52 (January 1941). named after William G. Cochran, is a one-sided upper limit variance outlier test. The C test is used to decide if a single estimate of a variance (or a standard deviation) is significantly larger than a group of variances (or standard deviations) with which the single estimate is supposed to be comparable. The C test is discussed in many text books D.L. Massart, B.G.M. Vandeginste, L.M.C. Buydens, S. de Jong, P.J. Lewi, J.

The C test assumes a balanced design, i.e. the considered full data set should consist of individual data series that all have equal size. The C test further assumes that each individual data series is normally distributed. Although primarily an outlier test, the C test is also in use as a simple alternative for regular homoscedasticity tests such as Bartlett's test, Levene's test and the Brown‚ÄìForsythe test to check a statistical data set for homogeneity of variances. An even simpler way to check homoscedasticity is provided by Hartley's Fmax test, but Hartley's Fmax test has the disadvantage that it only accounts for the minimum and the maximum of the variance range, while the C test accounts for all variances within the range. Description The C test detects one exceptionally large variance value at a time. The corresponding data series is then omitted from the full data set. According to ISO standard 5725 the C test may be iterated until no further exceptionally large variance values are detected, but such practice may lead to excessive rejections if the underlying data series are not normally distributed. The C test evaluates the ratio: ::C_j = \\\\frac{S_j^2}{\\\\displaystyle \\\\sum_{i=1}^N S_i^2} where: :Cj = Cochran's C statistic for data series j :Sj = standard deviation of data series j :N = number of data series that remain in the data set; N is decreased in steps of 1 upon each iteration of the C test :Si = standard deviation of data series i (1 ‚â§ i ‚â§ N) The C test tests the null hypothesis (H0) against the alternative hypothesis (Ha): :H0: All variances are equal. :Ha: At least one variance value is significantly larger than the other variance values. Critical values The sample variance of data series j is considered an outlier at significance level Œ± if Cj exceeds the upper limit critical value CUL. CUL depends on the desired significance level Œ±, the number of considered data series N, and the number of data points (n) per data series. Selections of values for CUL have been tabulated at significance levels Œ± = 0.01,R.

't Lam, Scrutiny of variance results for outliers: Cochran's test optimized, Analytica Chimica Acta 659, 68‚Äì84 (2010); Œ± = 0.025, and Œ± = 0.05. CUL can also be calculated from: :C_\\\\text {UL}(\\\\alpha,n,N) = \\\\left [ 1+ \\\\frac{N-1}{F_\\\\text {c}(\\\\alpha/N,(n-1),(N-1)(n-1))} \\\\right ]^{-1} . Here: :CUL = upper limit critical value for one-sided test on a balanced design :Œ± = significance level, e.g., 0.05 :n = number of data points per data series :Fc = critical value of Fisher's F ratio; Fc can be obtained from tables of the F distributionTable of critical values of the F-distribution:NIST or using computer software for this function. Generalization The C test can be generalized to include unbalanced designs, one-sided lower limit tests and two-sided tests at any significance level Œ±, for any number of data series N, and for any number of individual data points nj in data series j.R.U.E.

In late April, a band of Chiricahua Apaches attacked settlements in Santa Cruz County, Arizona over the course of two days. The Apaches raided four cattle ranches in or around Bear Valley, leaving four settlers dead, including a woman and her baby. They also captured a young girl, who was found dead several days after the event, and stole or destroyed a large amount of private property. When the United States Army learned of the attack, an expedition was launched to pursue the hostiles. In May, two small skirmishes were fought just across the international border in Sonora, Mexico but both times the Apaches were able to escape capture.Michno, pg. 349-350 Raid Lieutenant Powhatan Clarke wearing his Medal of Honor sometime before his death in 1893. The raid occurred during the final campaign of the war, in which thousands of soldiers and militia searched the frontier for a small band of Chiricahuas from San Carlos. Most of the natives followed the warrior Geronimo, though there were other leaders who led their own groups. The Apaches, after escaping the reservations, would usually retreat to their strongholds in the Sierra Madre of northern Mexico. From there they would raid against the Mexicans or cross the international border to raid in the United States, as was the situation in Bear Valley. The valley is a large region located in southern Arizona, just north of the border with Sonora, and west of Nogales, making it the ideal target for Apache raiders in northern Mexico. Geronimo, sometime after his surrender, said he did not lead the attack which meant if it wasn't him it was likely perpetrated by the warrior Naiche, the eldest son of the famous Chief Cochise. However, Geronimo was said to have been raiding in the area at the time. When the Apaches entered Bear Valley, they first attacked two men who were traveling through the desert near Oro Blanco. The men were A. L. Peck and his assistant, Charles Owen. They were ambushed about two miles from Peck's ranch in Agua Fria Canyon. Owen was shot and killed immediately but Peck was taken prisoner. The hostiles tied Peck to a tree and kept him under guard for about an hour before setting him free without his shoes. Peck then ran bareboot back to his home where he found that the house was destroyed and that his wife and eleven-month-old baby had been murdered. Peck also found that his twelve-year-old niece had been captured. She was held prisoner by the Apaches until late June 1886, when she was rescued by Mexican Militiamen and subsequently reunited with her parents. After the attack on Peck's ranch the Apaches continued on towards Sycamore Canyon and the nearby homesteads, some twenty miles south of Arivaca. One of the homesteads was the cattle ranch of John \\"Yank\\" Bartlett and his partner Henry \\"Hank\\" Hewitt, located at the head of the canyon. On April 28, the day after the attack at Peck's ranch, a local man named Phil Shanahan was visiting the Bartlett ranch where his ten-year-old son, Little Phil Shanahan, was staying with Johnny Bartlett, the son of Yank Bartlett. Eventually Shanahan decided to ride back to his ranch, a few miles away, leaving his son, Little Phil, at the Bartlett ranch. Shortly after that the boys heard gunfire in the distance and then Shanahan stumbled back into view of the ranch house saying he had been shot. Yank could tell by the wound that Shanahan needed a doctor so he told his son Johnny to ride to Oro Blanco to get help and alarm the townspeople. Yank also told Little Phil to go back to his home and warn his mother and his sisters. Phil made it to his house without incident and he took his family into the mountains where they hid until the following day. But, while the Shanahans were in hiding, the raiders attacked their house, stealing food, clothing and killing some cattle. Not long after Johnny left, he discovered three men \\"dressed in black and acting as if they were drunk.\\" Afraid, Johnny turned around and went back, only to find that the Apaches had arrived and were firing into the house. Johnny rode through the firing to the door of the house, he was not hurt but his horse was wounded and died in the doorway. Yank returned the Apache's fire, while at the same time trying to tend to Shanahan's wound, and received a bullet to one of his shoulders, but he remained conscious and continued to fight. When it was dark, Yank sent Johnny out to ride to Oro Blanco again.McClintock, pg. 259-260 For the first two miles Johnny walked barefoot, so as to avoid making too much noise, until he reached the ranch of E.W. Smith. Johnny found that the ranch house had been broken into and that black clothing, a gun, and a bottle of brandy had been taken. Smith was found just after, he had apparently hidden, or was elsewhere, when the Apaches attacked. Smith joined Johnny and together the rode to Oro Blanco, arriving at 2:00 am the next morning. Meanwhile, Yank was able to fend off the attackers so when Johnny returned with help the hostiles were already gone. Aftermath For their bravery, both Little Phil Shanahan and Johnny Bartlett received a commemorative rifle from the citizens of Santa Cruz County who regarded the boys as heroes. Five people were killed as result of the raid, including Phil Shanahan, who died of his wound, and the twelve-year-old niece of A.L. Peck. The Agua Fria Canyon was later renamed Peck Canyon and today the creek near Yank's ranch house is known as Yank's Spring, foundations of the house still remain intact and mark the beginning of a trail leading through Sycamore Canyon. When the army learned of the raid, Captain Thomas C. Lebo and Troop K of the 10th Cavalry were sent after the Apaches. Captain Lebo picked up the hostiles' trail near the Bartlett ranch and tracked the raiders south for over 200 miles before finally catching up with them on May 3, in the Pinito Mountains of Sonora, Mexico. During the trek, the Buffalo Soldiers counted thirty dead horses the Apaches had ridden to death. A small battle was fought as the Apaches fired on the cavalrymen from the top of a steep hill. The first volley killed a private named Hollis and wounded a corporal named Scott. Under accurate fire from the Apaches, Lieutenant Powhatan Clarke rescued Corporal Scott by dragging him to safety. For this, Clarke later received the Medal of Honor. After several hours of fighting, the hostiles retreated further into the Mexican wilderness, having lost two killed and one wounded. Several other army units became involved at that point but it was Captain Charles A.P. Hatfield and Company D, 4th Cavalry, that eventually found the Apaches encamped on May 15, near the village of Santa Cruz, between the Santa Cruz and San Pedro Rivers. A second skirmish ensued in which the cavalry charged and routed the hostiles, killing or wounded at least one man and capturing their horses and camping equipment. However, shortly after Hatfield decided to make for the nearby village of Santa Cruz, his command was ambushed five miles from the town while they were stopped at an animal watering hole. Two Americans were killed in the fight, a cook and a blacksmith, and two sergeants were wounded, one of them, Samuel Henry Craig, later received the Medal of Honor for his \\"conspicuous gallantry.\\" Again the Apaches retreated and they weren't captured until the end of the war in September when Geronimo surrendered.Michno, pg. 349-350 See also *Battle of Bear Valley *Skeleton Canyon Massacres References * * Category:History of Arizona Category:19th-century military history of the United States Category:History of Mexico Category:American frontier Category:Battles involving the Apache Category:Apache Wars Category:1886 in the United States Category:1886 in Mexico Category:Conflicts in 1886 Category:Arizona folklore Category:Massacres by Native Americans Category:History of Santa Cruz County, Arizona Category:Military raids Category:1886 in Arizona Territory Category:April 1886 events ","title":"Raid on Bear Valley"},{"id":"33166325","text":"The Plainfield Armory in Plainfield, New Jersey is no longer used by the New Jersey Army National Guard. The building had been the object of preservation and re-use efforts by civic organizations and municipal authorities. It was sold in 2013. It was the headquarters of the private New Jersey Naval Militia Foundation. History First proposed in 1927, the armory was built between 1931 and 1932 as the home of Headquarters Company of the 44th Division and is representative of the small, one-company facilities designed in the 1920s and early 1930s by the State Architect's Office. The 18,000 square foot, two-story building is constructed of Flemish bond brick and is set upon by a raised basement. The administrative offices at the front sport bay windows while the back is a small drill hall, now flanked on either side by classrooms. The lobby contains a box office, which reflects its use by both the community and the National Guard. While windows and doors were replaced at a later stage, the building is only slightly altered since construction and maintains its architectural integrity as a smaller single company armory. In the early 1990s, the underutilized armory was closed and has been rented to veterans groups. Status Tha armory was owned by the State of New Jersey, which first offered to sell it in 2005 after the New Jersey Department of Military and Veterans Affairs determined that it was a surplus building, requesting a $1 million minimum bid and stipulating that it may not be demolished. There are calls from the community that it should be purchased and converted to a broader public use. While the building was offered to the city, no offer was made, as the price is considered too high and the building would likely require renovations and the installation of an HVAC system to be made suitable for regular general use. While the New Jersey State Historic Preservation Office has deemed the armory eligible for the state and the federal listings of historic places in Union County, New Jersey, it is not listed. Headquartered at the armory, the New Jersey Naval Militia Foundation, member of the State Guard Association of the United States and advocate of the restoration of the New Jersey Naval Militia, is a proponent of the building's listing and preservation. In January 2012, the building was offered at auction.http://www.mycentraljersey.com/article/20120119/NJNEWS/301190032/Plainfield- Armory-up-auction-next-week?nclick_check=1 In December 2012 the New Jersey Legislature approved sale of the building and grounds for $926,000 as surplus property.http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2012/Bills/AL12/77_.HTMhttp://ptalker2.blogspot.nl/2012/03/armory- is-auctioned.html See also *New Jersey National Guard *National Guard Militia Museum of New Jersey *naval militia  References  External links *Star-Ledger September 2008 article about NJ Naval militia *http://www.mycentraljersey.com/article/20120119/NJNEWS/301190032/Plainfield- Armory-up-auction-next-week *http://ptalker2.blogspot.nl/2012/03/armory-is- auctioned.html *http://legiscan.com/gaits/text/642913 Category:Plainfield, New Jersey Category:Armories in New Jersey Category:Buildings and structures in Union County, New Jersey Category:Military installations in New Jersey Category:1932 establishments in New Jersey ","title":"Plainfield Armory"},{"id":"33166360","text":"Duck Lake is a lake located on Vancouver Island east of Lizard Lake on the south side of upper China Creek, south east of Port Alberni,GeoBC: BC Geographical Names - Duck Lake The lake lies at an elevation of above sea level in the China Creek Community Watershed.

The film was released under different titles in several European territories: e.g., as Jersey Devil in the German-speaking countries, as The Forest in Belgium and France, and as Devil in the Woods in the United Kingdom, when shown on The Horror Channel in January 2015. Plot Two young campers walk together through the woods, commenting that there are no animals or birds around. They discover a pile of mutilated deer carcasses left on the trail and then are chased by a mutilated deer that drops dead in front of them. Something sounding like a large swarm of birds is heard approaching. Richard Vineyard, his wife Cynthia, his daughter Sadie, and his young son Danny leave their suburban home for a camping trip. They want to leave civilization behind and bond as a family in the Pine Barrens, a forest in southern New Jersey. On the way to the campsite, they see a mutilated deer crossing the road. They stay in a crowded commercial campsite full of obnoxious campers who are not inclined to abandon civilization: cell phones and loud music abound. While setting up his tent, Richard has a flashback to a traumatic event from his childhood that occurred in the Barrens. Later that evening, when a fellow camper tells a story of the Jersey Devil, the campers pull a prank that scares the Vineyard family. Richard overreacts, much to the embarrassment of the rest of the family. That night, Richard has a nightmare in which he is being chased through a field by something unseen. He is awakened by Cynthia in the middle of the forest, having actually run from their tent while asleep. He accuses his wife of infidelity; she doesn't understand his suspicion and tries to reassure him. Richard apologizes. Cynthia returns to the tent, and Richard goes for a walk. He sees a deer carcass fall from a tree. Several facts are revealed in conversation the next day. Richard is taking pain medication for a wound received before they left home. Cynthia is his second wife after the loss of Sadie's mother a decade prior. One of the campers involved in the prank the previous night is missing. Richard, who appears weakened by illness, leads his family deeper into the forest, away from the trails, to a new campsite. While resting, Danny finds the disemboweled corpse of the missing camper but says nothing. Richard begins hallucinating and becomes irritable. They find a campsite containing a decomposed dog, a shredded tent, and furs hanging to dry, but no people. They decide to set up camp there. Richard disposes of the dog, and discovers that another camper, Ryan, has been following them and is communicating secretly with Sadie by cell phone. Richard returns to the campsite and tries to take Sadie's cell phone away. Cynthia announces that they are going home the next day. That night, Sadie searches for Ryan and is frightened by something in the woods. It is revealed in conversation that Richard killed the family's rabid dog before they left home, because it bit him. Richard‚Äôs mental state deteriorates. Richard sleepwalks again, and awakens surrounded by mist. The Jersey Devil appears behind him. Cynthia gathers the family and they leave immediately, but Danny and Richard get ahead and disappear. Cynthia calls the police, and she and Sadie discover Ryan's disemboweled corpse; Richard‚Äôs knife is next to the body. They find Danny face down in the river, but are able to resuscitate him. Richard returns but has a seizure. He attacks Cynthia and breaks her leg. Sadie knocks him unconscious and ties him up. Sadie and Danny leave to find help, leaving the severely injured Cynthia with her hysterical husband. Cynthia passes out from the pain. Richard sees the Jersey Devil again. He breaks free of his bonds. Cynthia knocks her husband out with a rock, but when she checks on him a few minutes later he has vanished. Cynthia screams as she is suddenly attacked by something unseen. Sadie and Danny encounter a cougar but are rescued by a hunter. The police find the bodies of the missing campers. The hunter, Sadie, and Danny find Richard and Cynthia. Richard attacks the hunter and acquires his rifle. Richard seemingly turns on his family with the rifle. He sees the Jersey Devil behind them. For the first time, the others see it as well. Richard attempts to shoot it, but he is instead shot by the sheriff who thinks he is aiming at Sadie. The Jersey Devil attacks, kills the sheriff, and then turns on the Vineyards. A forest ranger witnesses the monster attack and flees. Sometime later Sadie is being interviewed by the authorities before being reunited with her brother. Her story of what she and her brother saw is dismissed as psychological trauma. Afterwards Sadie joins the ranger and a group of hunters, with the intent on hunting the Jersey Devil down.

Bousman originally intended to shoot the film in the actual Pine Barrens of New Jersey, but filming eventually took place in the Toronto, Ontario area for budgetary reasons with the cast and crew mainly staying in the town of Caledon. Three different forests were used for the woods. The film was planned to be shot in 20 days. However, two days were lost due to severe rainfall. As some of the actors and crew members had other commitments immediately afterward, it had to be filmed in 18 days instead. All the daylight scenes at the campsite were filmed on a single day. Home media The Barrens was released on Blu-ray, DVD, and digital download on October 9, 2012. Included on the Blu-ray and DVD releases is an audio commentary with director Darren Lynn Bousman and cinematographer Joseph White, as well as a deleted scene which serves as an alternative ending. In this ending, it is revealed that Sadie and Danny survived the attack by the Jersey Devil. As winter sets in, Sadie, Ranger Bob, and several others set off into the barrens, armed to the teeth, to hunt the Jersey Devil. Director Bousman considers this ending not to be canon, joking that those scenes will be \\"saved for the sequel\\". Reception Brett Gallman from Oh, the Horror.com called the film \\"a missed opportunity\\", criticizing the film's uneven focus, and misleading marketing centering on the Jersey Devil, which was barely acknowledged in the film. In his review of the film, Gallman wrote, \\"The Barrens is an unfortunate bait and switch that bungles its intriguing setup and degenerates into a muddled, predictable routine.\\" Dread Central awarded the film a score of two and a half out of five. The reviewer wrote, \\"Overall, while I have my issues with The Barrens, I can‚Äôt quite warn anyone away from watching it. It‚Äôs certainly well made and well acted. And the story is an interesting one, full of twists and turns this reviewer wasn‚Äôt expecting. If you‚Äôre a fan of Bousman‚Äôs work, this may be worth a look for you, so long as you keep your expectations somewhat low.\\" See also * 13th Child * Carny (2009 film) * The Last Broadcast (film) References External links  Movie & TV Projects: The Barrens at AllStephenMoyer.com * The Barrens on Facebook Category:2012 films Category:Films directed by Darren Lynn Bousman Category:2012 horror films Category:American monster movies Category:American films Category:2010s monster movies Category:English-language films Category:Films set in New Jersey Category:Films based on urban legends Category:Films about cryptids Category:Jersey Devil in fiction Category:2010s psychological horror films Category:Backwoods slasher films ","title":"The Barrens (film)"},{"id":"33166452","text":"ZetaZeroAlfa is an Italian RAC group from Rome.

December 8, 2001 - During one of their gigs at Teatro Piccolo in Sulmona a riot started, because of approximately 20 Antifa activists trying to stop the concert. The situation was resolved only because of police intervention. The band leader Gianluca Iannone, along with 4 others, was sentenced to 10 months for \\"acts of violence\\". This was the first of a series of boycotts organized by Antifascist militants which have struck the band ever since. November 14, 2005 - As an act of solidarity with prisoners, ZZA along with the band La Peggio Giovent√π played live in the Roman Prison Rebibbia. During the event they presented football player Damiano Tommasi with a prize named after the prison journal Premio Nonsolochiacchiere. The crowd was composed of 300 prisoners along with the entire (80) prison staff. This was the first time a band not belonging to \\"the left\\" had ever played inside an Italian detention facility. June 18, 2010 - ZZA held a nationwide pre- release party which took place in 26 Italian cities simultaneously. October 22, 2010 - The launch of the book \\"Nessun Dolore: Una storia di Casapound (No Pain: The story of CasaPound)\\" saw for the first time ZZA holding an outdoor gig, which took place in Ponte Milvio. More than 2000 people were in attendance. So far ZZA have played more than 80 gigs in Italy and abroad.  Lyrical theme  Although having lyrics which criticize globalization and the excesses derived from the Free Market system, often their songs are both characteristically joyful and sarcastic. Their music predominately attracts a young crowd who are most often associated to various fascist movements and groups, in particular those linked to the association for social promotion CasaPound Italia, its student movement Blocco Studentesco, and those revolving around OSA/ONC (\\"Occupazioni a Scopo Abitativo\\" ed \\"Occupazioni Non Conformi\\").  Concerts abroad  May 1, 2004 - The band played live for the first time outside of Italy in Nice, France. The support bands included local group Fraction, as well as Ile De France from Paris. June 29, 2004 - Completed a short tour of Quebec. May 9, 2007 - In honour of S√©bastien Deyzieu (Groupe Union D√©fense militant who died under dubious circumstances) they played a second time in France, this time in Paris. During the summer of 2007 they took part in the \\"European Revolution Tour 2007\\" together with French band Fraction, German group Carpe Diem, and Brigade M from the Netherlands. Tour dates included: Eindhoven June 29, Saarbr√ºcken, June 30, Latina, Lazio July 6, Marseille July 7. May 24, 2009 - Played London as part of the \\"Warmachine Tour\\". June 12, 2011 - The band plays a show in solidarity with the Karen People live in Bangkok. October 22, 2011 - ZZA played at Helsinki, Finland, after the \\"Taistele vastaan!\\" (Fight back!) -seminar arranged by Nordic Resistance Movement. Other speakers on the seminar were the representatives from CasaPound Italia and independent German nationalist movement called \\"Frei Nationale Strukturen\\". (http://www.patriootti.com/kansainvalinen-seminaari- jarjestettiin-helsingissa/)  \\"La cinghiamattanza\\"  One of the characteristics which has been popularized by the group is practice of \\"La cinghiamattanza\\". Named after one of their songs which is featured on a split with Italian counterparts Hate For Breakfast. The act of \\"La cinghiamattanza\\" is as follows: while ZZA plays the \\"La cinghiamattanza\\" track, those in the crowd moshing take out their belts grabbing them by the buckle (as stipulated by the rules). With belts in hand, they begin to flog each other with the straps. For this reason at the beginning of 2008, numerous videos appeared on YouTube showing young people from all around Italy imitating the practice. Because of this, the band receives unexpected coverage over major media outlets, in particular La Repubblica and its youth magazine XL, which described the phenomenon as the \\"new stupid trend\\". In 2010 the Rai3 programme Citizen Report also dedicated one of its episodes to La cinghiamattanza. ZZA state that \\"denying such a non-conformist sport with its joyful and vitalistic energy could only be seen as an act sheer dishonesty\\".

While working for George Nelson Associates, Inc. on designs for Herman Miller furniture, Harper became one of the most prolific designers of the modernist style. Among his important designs is the Herman Miller company logo, and the company's Marshmallow sofa. Early years Harper was born in New York City in 1916. After attending Cooper Union and Brooklyn College, Irving Harper worked as a draftsman for the Gilbert Rohde's office during the 1930s.George Nelson Design Archive website; accessed August 5, 2015. While there he was responsible for the creation of the Plexiglas Exhibit, the Anthracite exhibit, and the Home Furnishings Focal exhibit at the 1939 New York World's Fair. Leaving Rohde's, he worked as an interior designer for noted industrial designer Raymond Loewy at the Raymond Loewy Associates office, designing interiors in the company's department store division. Born Irving Hoffzimer to David and Rebecca Hoffzimer. Oldest of three children He had two sisters, Phyliss and Sophie. George Nelson Associates, Inc. In the 1940s Harper met George Nelson. In 1947 he was offered a job as an interior designer by Nelson and joined George Nelson Associates, Inc. Initially Harper was mostly responsible for designing trade advertising for the Herman Miller furniture account. In 1947 Harper designed the logo for Herman Miller, Inc. Never trained as a graphic artist, Harper based the logo around a large letter \\"M\\", for Miller. At first the logo was in wood-grain, since wood figured prominently in Herman Miller furniture. Harper stated, \\"I continued to use the M and refined it as the ads went on. The Herman Miller logo was something they got for free, and they loved it.\\" He chuckled. \\"There was no project to do a logo. It was probably the cheapest logo campaign in advertising history.\\" Harper also was responsible for the textile prints used by Nelson's studio. =Clocks= Later Nelson got the Howard Miller Clock Co. account, and Harper was given the responsibility of handling it. Harper decided to create clocks that were a piece of sculpture. \\"To omit numbers and have an abstract object that moved on the wall was something no one was doing at the time\\". He would design a group of about eight clocks once or twice a year, which were sent to Howard Miller Clock Co. Most were put into production. =Marshmallow sofa= A row of marshmallow sofas In 1954, Harper was introduced to a salesman from a Long Island plastics company. The salesman offered a product that created 12 inch diameter self- skinning discs. George Nelson embraced the idea as a way to manufacture low- cost furniture. Over a weekend Harper designed a sofa incorporating 18 of the discs in a whimsical pattern. The salesman's product didn't live up to expectations, but Harper's design was put into production by Herman Miller as the Marshmallow sofa. =Controversy= Harper worked for George Nelson Associates, Inc. for 17 years. During his time with the firm most of Harper's designs were attributed to George Nelson, as was the company's practice. John Pile, a designer for the firm in the 1950s, explains, \\"George's attitude was that it was okay for individual designers to be given credit in trade publications, but for the consumer world, the credit should always be to the firm, not the individual. He didn't always follow through on that policy though.\\" After George Nelson Harper left George Nelson Associates, Inc. in 1963. Together with Phillip George they started Harper+George, a design company. The firm created iconic designs for Penn Central in 1965, Braniff International Airways from 1967 until 1982, Jack Lenor Larsen, and Hallmark Cards, among many others. Harper retired from Harper+George in 1983, and resided in Rye, New York, in a 19th-century farmhouse filled with modernist furnishings, and over 300 of his paper sculptures. In early 2001 Harper teamed with textile designer Michael Maharam to re-introduce Harper's original 1950s era Herman Miller textile prints as part of Maharam's \\"Textiles of the 20th Century\\" line. Harper's print \\"Pavement fabric\\" was the first to be re- introduced in 2001, followed by \\"China Shop\\" in the fall of that year.

Two months later his parents moved to Fort Qu'Appelle, Saskatchewan, where his father, Dr. R.G. Ferguson, had been appointed General Superintendent and Medical Director of the recently established Saskatchewan Anti-Tuberculosis League. This was a difficult time for the young family. Dr. Ferguson was treating his own brother, Vernon, who had returned from service in Ypres, Belgium with tuberculosis. Tragedy struck when another of Dr. Ferguson's younger brothers, Frank, a member of RFC 87 Squadron, was killed when the Sopwith Dolphin he was flying in a dogfight near the Canadian-German line in France was shot down by German Ace Michael Hutterer. Frank Ferguson was shot down September 3, 1918 near Marcoyne. Matters at home were not helped by another legacy of the war: Spanish influenza (aka H1N1). George became ill and was quarantined in the TB Sanatorium. Bob Ferguson had hoped to follow in his father's footsteps by establishing a career in medicine, however that was not to be. Instead, he began a degree in agriculture at the University of Regina in 1937. As was the case for so many of his generation, his education was interrupted by World War II.The Third Degree, University of Regina Alumni Magazine, Fall 1999, Volume 11, Number 2. pg. 16-17 World War II Bob Ferguson's flight training took place over the winter of 1940-41. Assigned to Night Fighter (Cougar) Squadron 410, whose job was to protect the coast of Scotland and, later, England. The first official sortie of No. 410 Squadron was from RAF Drem, East Lothian, Scotland, on the night of 4 June 1942, when twelve Beaufighter crews took off. It went on to become the top-scoring night fighter squadron in the RAF Second Tactical Air Force during the period between D-Day and VE-Day. No. 410 Squadron supported the Allied forces during the Normandy Landings and the Battle of the Bulge, flew nightly patrols during this time and many of its pilots gained ace status. Two members of No. 410 Squadron, Flight Lieutenant (F/L) Currie and Flying Officer (F/O) Rose, were the first members of the RCAF to see the German V-2 rocket in flight. While with Squadron 410 Ferguson met and became roommates with John Aiken (later Sir John Aiken). Aiken later became Chief Air Marshal of the RAF. Much later he was to say of Ferguson: \\"A natural leader, Bob Ferguson cared deeply for his squadron and it showed in the respect he showed his pilots and his initiative in improving skills. Indeed to me he personified the success of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan.\\" Ferguson was promoted rapidly, achieving the rank of Flying Officer in October, 1942, Flight Lieutenant in January 1943, and Squadron Leader in January 1944. Ferguson quickly developed a reputation for innovative training and meticulous preparation with his squadron and took them up at night where they would chase each other in the dark in order to improve their skills with the use of the radar. He identified several weaknesses in the aerial gunnery courses which were all taught on Spitfires while most pilots flew other more heavily armoured aircraft. Hearing his criticism Wing Commander Archie Winskill of RAF Winfield called on Ferguson to set up and develop a twin engine gunnery course. He did, the course was very successful and soon pilots brought their own de Havilland Mosquito or Beaufighter planes with them for training from all over the UK. The students were interviewed continually to refine the course and further improve the training before the pilots were posted to aerial combat. Bob, too, flew a Mosquito fighter/ bomber during WWll. When the Mosquito entered production in 1941, it was one of the fastest operational aircraft in the world. Entering widespread service in 1942, the Mosquito supported RAF strategic night fighter defence forces in the United Kingdom from Luftwaffe raids, most notably defeating the German aerial offensive Operation Steinbock in 1944. Offensively, the Mosquito units also conducted night time fighter sweeps in indirect and direct protection of RAF Bomber Command's heavy bombers to help reduce RAF bomber losses in 1944 and 1945. Home on leave in September 1944 Bob was invited to \\"pin\\" the wings on his younger brother David at his graduation as a pilot and air gunner in the RCAF. Bob Ferguson gave up flying after the war but maintained a keen interest in his beloved 410 Squadron, later led by his brother in law, Wing Commander Keith Fallis. Now responsible for ensuring the safety of Canada's domestic airspace Cougar Squadron currently operates out of Cold Lake Alberta as the operational training squadron for Canada's CF-18 fleet.Ralph, Wayne \\"Aces, Warriors and Wingmen\\" John Wiley & Sons 2005 After the War Ferguson returned to the University of Saskatchewan to complete his degree. He began farming before the war and resumed it when the war ended, at the same time finishing his Bachelor of Arts degree (1946) from the University of Saskatchewan and Bachelor of Science in Agriculture in 1949. His 1946 graduation marked a memorable occasion: his father received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree at the same ceremony. \\"When I got my BA, he got his Honorary Doctor of Laws. And when I went across the stage to pick up my diploma, my father bowed graciously as I went by\\" he recalled in an interview with The University of Regina's Alumni Magazine in Fall 1999. In the film 'My Father's Legacy' he recounts his father saying, \\"Now that you have received your degree you must remember that you have only paid for a small part of the cost of your education. What are you going to for your community, your province and your country to help repay the cost of the education for which they have paid for you.\\" His father's call to action on graduation day was all the motivation he needed. With characteristic understatement he said, \\"When dad asked me what I was going to do it got me thinking.\\" In spite of his disappointment at not being able to follow in his father's footsteps by establishing a medical career, he found another vocation: farming. Farming opened the door to extensive involvement in community service, particularly in support of Saskatchewan's two universities. As a University of Regina alumnus he helped build the alumni association, serving on the board from its inception. In that capacity he helped establish awards for excellence to honour professors' research and teaching, and was the first chair of the scholarship committee. He saw scholarships as a way to give back to the institution, and has established three at the University of Regina. Bob Ferguson had a happy family life. He was devoted to his wife Norma, giving her roses every week of their 57 years of marriage. In 1999 he told the U of R Alumni Magazine: \\"I've had a most exciting and interesting life. I look back on it and I just wouldn't have changed anything.\\" He died on September 19, 2006 in Regina, Saskatchewan, leaving four children and six grandchildren. Bob lived his life in a way in which his father would be proud but he did not live his life in his father's shadow. He lived his own life, deeply inspired by his father's values and ideals. Characteristically, one of his last official acts was to sign the letters for the 2006 Christmas Seals Campaign for the Saskatchewan Lung Association. He said \\"If the Lung Association has benefited from our association half as much as I have then it has been time well spent.\\"  References  Category:1917 births Category:Royal Canadian Air Force personnel Category:Mayors of places in Saskatchewan Category:Members of the Order of Canada Category:Members of the Saskatchewan Order of Merit Category:2006 deaths ","title":"Robert Ross Ferguson"},{"id":"33166633","text":"Borgan may refer to: People *Ole Hermann Borgan (born 1965), Norwegian football assistant referee *Geir Borgan Paulsen (born 1957), Norwegian weightlifter and bodybuilder Places *Borgan, Iran, a city and capital of Qasr-e Qand County, in Sistan and Baluchestan Province, Iran *Borgan, Norway, an island in the Vikna archipelago in Tr√∏ndelag county, Norway ","title":"Borgan"},{"id":"33166657","text":"Gravdalsvatnet is a lake in the western part of Bergen Municipality in Vestland county, Norway.

McCaull in 1880. The company produced operetta, comic opera and musical theatre in New York City and on tour in the eastern and midwestern U.S. and Canada until McCaull's death in 1894. It nurtured such stars, in their early careers, as Lillian Russell and DeWolf Hopper. History =Early years= McCaull (1846‚Äì1894) was born in Scotland. He served as a colonel in the Confederate Army and later became a lawyer in Baltimore.Bordman, Gerald and Thomas S. Hischak. \\"McCaull, John A.\\" in The Oxford Companion to American Theatre, 2004, Encyclopedia.com, accessed 21 September 2011 He was representing John T. Ford, lessee of the Fifth Avenue Theatre in New York, when Gilbert and Sullivan presented H.M.S. Pinafore in December 1879 and premiered The Pirates of Penzance at the end of that month. McCaull was attracted to theatrical production and became involved as an investor with these productions. He then quit his law practice to produce light opera. For the Christmas season in 1880, he staged Olivette at the Bijou Theatre in New York. The strong success of this piece encouraged him to continue to present comic opera. McCaull explained the goals of his opera company to The New York Times: \\"The public demands good voices. .... Our aim is to build up this thing until we get something like the Op√©ra comique in Paris\\".Busch, Stephen E. \\"John A. McCaull Comic Opera Companies\\", at the Opera in Old Colorado website, accessed September 21, 2011 McCaull invested $10,000 in Rudolph Aronson's newly rebuilt Casino Theatre in New York in 1882. He opened the theatre the same year with the American premiere of the Strauss operetta The Queen's Lace Handkerchief.\\"The Late John A. M'Caull\\", The New York Times, November 14, 1894, accessed September 22, 2011 Also there, the company produced Prince Methusalem (1883), Der Bettelstudent (1883‚Äì84), Falka (1884), Nell Gwynne (with a new libretto),Fiske, Stephen. \\"Dramatic Feuilleton,\\" The Art Amateur, Vol. 12, No. 1 (December 1884), p. 4. Fiske noted: \\"Colonel McCaull produced the new opera magnificently. ... The scenery and costumes were superb.\\" Die Fledermaus (1885), Apajune, the Water Nymph (1885)Fiske, Stephen. \\"Music and Drama\\", The Art Amateur, Vol. 12, No. 3 (February 1885), p. 58 and The Black Hussar (1885). The success of The Black Hussar led to an extended run.Fiske, Stephen. \\"Music and Drama\\", The Art Amateur, Vol. 13, No. 4 (September 1885), p. 68 After this, McCaull quarrelled with the Aronsons and was forced out of the theatre, so the company became exclusively a touring company.According to critic Stephen Fiske (in The Art Amateur, Vol. 13, No. 1 (June 1885), pp. 3‚Äì4, the break in relations necessitated performing The Black Hussar at Wallack's Theatre. The company returned to Broadway, however, for summer seasons at Wallack's Theatre and for brief productions at other theaters, including Rudolph Dellinger's Lorraine and De Koven's The Begum, both in 1887. By 1885, McCaull had three companies on tour almost continually. McCaull told The New York Times, \\"Two of these companies play 40 weeks in the year. The other plays 52 weeks. ... [T]here are 1,300 people who receive their direct support in connection with my companies.\\" The performers included Frederick Leslie, Eug√®ne Oudin, Digby Bell, Lillian Russell, Frank Daniels, Francis Wilson, May Yoh√© and DeWolf Hopper. The company appeared in Denver, Colorado in 1883, playing Johann Strauss II's The Queen's Lace Handkerchief. The review in the Rocky Mountain News praised the cast and stated that \\"in musical and dramatic ability and magnificent costuming, the McCaull opera company is the best that has ever visited Denver. The scenery is very pretty and appropriate, the chorus well trained and well dressed.\\" In 1890 in Kansas City and Denver, the company produced The Black Hussar and Von Suppe's opera Clover, \\"which was given to a crowded and appreciative house. It was exceedingly well put on and was fully enjoyed, applause being continued and frequent. The chorus work was excellent and the work of the principals left nothing to be desired.\\" =Later years= Late in 1888 in Chicago, McCaull fell on ice, receiving a deep cut on his head. This caused a brain injury that led to paralysis of the muscles of his throat and right side. For about a year afterwards, he continued to direct the company, although his speech was so difficult to understand that he eventually had to give up directing. The De Wolf Hopper Opera Company was then formed with some of McCaull's singers. Francis Wilson also formed his own opera company. By 1890, there were rumors that McCaull's company would disband.\\"The 'Seven Saubians' in Trouble: Rumors that the McCaull Opera Company Will Disband\\", Critic-Record, October 20, 1890. By 1891, McCaull had sold his properties and rights to perform works to Harry Askin. But McCaull and his wife sued Askin for not paying the full amount.\\"By the Name of M'Caull: Disagreements and a Suit Over the Opera Company's Affairs\\", New York Herald- Tribune, July 5, 1891. McCaull continued to control his companies, using hired managers, nearly until his death in 1894.On February 11, 1892, a benefit performance was given for McCaull at the Metropolitan Opera House, raising $8,000. Another benefit that year in Chicago raised an additional $1,450. In 1893, McCaull moved to Greensborough, North Carolina, where he died on November 11, 1894. His funeral was held on Nov. 14, 1894 at St. Martin's Catholic Church in Baltimore, where he was buried. He was survived by three daughters, Winifred, Angela (both actresses) and Margaret.

By strobing the LEDs in sequence, the \\"color wheel\\"Digital Light Processing#The color wheel .22rainbow effect.22 can be removed, making the new generation of DLP+LED projectors completely solid state, as well as reducing visual artifacts that put DLP at a disadvantage to LCD or LCOS, i.e. the \\"rainbow effect\\", in certain situations. Finally, the diamond pixels used on the DLP projection system provide some unusual benefits/tradeoffs. In a nutshell, the diamond pixels make computer graphics at native resolution a more \\"grainy\\" (by a tiny amount) at native resolution but, at compressed resolutions, better than compression on a square pixel grid. Movies displayed at native resolution have no noticeable difference, but movies at 1080p are exceptionally accurate (for not being \\"true\\" 1080p). When projecting a 1920√ó1080 sized computer graphical user interface (GUI), the text remains readable and is overall surprisingly faithful to what a full 1080p display would produce. The diamond pixel layout achieves this effect using a property of human vision and recognition similar in spirit, although not mathematically, to the psychoacoustics used to compress MP3's. No wobulation is used; this effect is purely enabled by the shape of the pixel.

Squadron insignia during the period of designation as HS-3 Mission Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron Nine's primary mission is to employ the versatility of the MH-60S helicopter to support the battle group commander's objectives, with emphasis on Anti-Surface Warfare (ASUW), Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR), support of Special Operations, and Vertical Replenishment (VERTREP). Secondary missions include Anti-Ship Missile defense and Medical Evacuation (MEDEVAC). Command history =Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron Three= A HSS-1 Seabat of HS-3 landing on in 1957. HSC-9 was established as Helicopter Antisubmarine Squadron Three (HS-3) on 18 June 1952, at the Naval Air Facility Elizabeth City, North Carolina. The Tridents commenced operations flying the Piasecki HUP-2S Retriever helicopter, and later transitioned to the Sikorsky HO4S and Sikorsky HSS-1 Seabat helicopters. In 1959 the squadron received the Sikorsky HSS-1N Seabat giving it the capability to operate at night. HS-3 was the first Atlantic Fleet operational squadron to operate the gas turbine powered HSS-2 Sea King in 1961. In September 1962 in compliance with the 1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system the HSS-2 Sea King was redesignated the SH-3A Sea King. In 1967 the squadron received the SH-3D, and finally the SH-3H TACNAV equipped helicopter in 1979. Additionally in 1982, HS-3 became the first squadron to deploy with the AQS-13E Sonar Data Computer. HS-3 was first deployed aboard and in late 1956, flying the HSS-1 Seabat. This was followed by assignments to , , and , in 1958‚Äì60. From 1960 to 1970, HS-3 was assigned to Carrier Anti-Submarine Air Group 56 (CVSG-56). CVSG-56 was first assigned to Valley Forge before moving to , in 1961. HS-3 then transitioned to the Sikorsky HSS-2/SH-3A Sea King. In 1962, on board , HS-3 participated in the naval blockade of Cuba. The Air Group was reassigned to in 1962 until she was deployed as an attack carrier to Vietnam in 1966. The Tridents began an active role in the space program on 24 May 1962, when then CO Commander J. M. Wondergem picked up Lieutenant Commander M. S. Carpenter from his Aurora 7 spacecraft and delivered him to Intrepid. Astronauts Carpenter, Grissom, Young, Collins, Gordon, Conrad, McDivitt, Scott, and Schweickart all ended their space journeys with rides aboard HS-3 helicopters. An HS-3 SH-3H Sea King aboard , in 1986. In 1967, CVSG-56 and HS-3 again deployed aboard Randolph, having received the SH-3D Sea King. Two years later, CVSG-56 was reassigned to and then to Intrepid in 1970. HS-3 was then reassigned to Carrier Air Wing Seventeen aboard . In the early 1970s, the squadron participated in the relief of Tunisian flood victims, rescuing or relocating 630 people while transporting over of food and medical supplies. In recognition of this humanitarian support, the squadron was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation. In July 1976, a detachment from HS-3 went aboard Forrestal and participated in the United States Bicentennial celebrations in New York Harbor. Squadron personnel participated in some of the publicity events leading up to the actual ringing of Forrestals bell on July 4, 1976. HS-3 won the Battle \\"E\\" in 1973 and 1978 as well as the Isbell Trophy in 1974 and 1978. In 1979, HS-3 received the SH-3H Sea King. From 1984 to 1991, CVW-17 and HS-3 were reassigned to . HS-3 was awarded two Navy Unit Commendations for operational accomplishments and outstanding maintenance efforts during the 1985-86 Mediterranean and Indian Ocean deployment on board Saratoga. The Tridents won three consecutive Battle \\"E\\" Awards for 1985, 1986 and 1987. They also won back-to-back Isbell Trophies in 1986 and 1987. In 1990, the Tridents enforced United Nations sanctions against Iraqi trade while deployed on board the Saratoga in the Red Sea. HS-3 conducted an actual Helicopter Visit, Board, Search and Seizure (HVBSS) with a special forces boarding team to \\"take down\\" a hostile merchant ship during Operation Desert Shield/Operation Desert Storm. HS-3 was awarded a Navy Unit Commendation for the combat support they provided in the campaign. The squadron returned home in early 1991 and was the first Atlantic squadron to transition to the Sikorsky SH-60F/HH-60H Seahawk. After transition to the SH-60F and HH-60H Seahawk in 1991, HS-3 was assigned to CVW-8 aboard , in 1993. Preparations for the squadron's 1995 Mediterranean deployment were interrupted when the Tridents were called on to support Operation Uphold Democracy during the military intervention in Haiti. HS-3 provided the sole Navy maritime SAR, CSAR and special operations support. The Tridents deployed one week after the completion of Uphold Democracy and flew in support of Operation Deny Flight over Bosnia-Herzegovina. During this deployment, HS-3 also flew the first actual CSAR mission by an HS squadron since the Vietnam era to search for the crew of a downed French Mirage fighter. In 1997, HS-3 deployed aboard to the Mediterranean Sea and the Persian Gulf. The Tridents again deployed aboard Theodore Roosevelt in March 1999 and headed straight into the first of two conflicts. During Operation Noble Anvil, HS-3 supported combat operations against Serbia in Kosovo. Once a cease-fire was agreed upon, Theodore Roosevelt transited the Persian Gulf to support maritime interdiction operations and enforce no-fly zones over southern Iraq. In August, HS-3 conducted a successful HVBSS to a freighter violating UN sanctions. The operation seized $3.5 million in Iraqi contraband. During this demanding deployment, HS-3 lifted over of cargo and completed over 2,000 small deck landings. HS-3 was awarded the Battle \\"E\\" for 1999. In April 2001, HS-3 deployed aboard . In response to the terror attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the Tridents conducted sustained operations in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan.

During the course of the deployment, HS-3 conducted ASW, logistics, and SAR operations in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. In September 2008, after completing a lengthy training cycle, the Tridents deployed aboard Theodore Roosevelt to the Arabian Sea in support of combat operations in Afghanistan. Along the way, HS-3 took part in a historic visit to Cape Town, South Africa. Theodore Roosevelt was the first U. S. carrier to visit Cape Town in over 40 years. Once arriving on-station in the CENTCOM AOR, the Tridents flew plane guard, anti-terrorism force protection, anti-surface warfare, logistics, and anti-submarine warfare in direct support of Operation Enduring Freedom and maritime security operations during the 2008-2009 deployment. The Tridents also detached three HH-60H aircraft to and subsequently to for two months. This detachment supported Combined Task Force 151 counter-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden. The Tridents assisted in apprehending 16 suspected pirates and paved the way for future operations in the region. In 2008, HS-3 won the CNAF Aviation Battle Efficiency, Commander, Naval Aviation Safety Center Safety \\"S\\", and the CAPT A. J.

On 16 April 2009, the Tridents returned home to Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Florida, from their final cruise as a Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron. During this year, the Tridents received the Jimmy Thach award for excellence in Anti-Submarine Warfare, an end cap to the squadron's legacy as an Anti-Submarine squadron. In May, the squadron started its permanent duty station change from Naval Air Station Jacksonville to Naval Air Station Norfolk, Virginia and airframe change to the MH-60S Seahawk. On 1 June 2009, the Tridents were redesignated Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron NINE (HSC-9). On 13 January 2010, the Tridents sent two helicopters in support of Operation Unified Response, providing humanitarian aid and disaster relief following the devastating Haiti earthquake. Squadron personnel spent three months deployed aboard and off the coast of Haiti, delivering over of disaster relief supplies and completing 240 MEDEVAC missions on the beleaguered island. The Tridents also brought ashore over of sustainment supplies and made 1,300 passenger transfers in support of the Operation.

He and Edme Mariotte were primarily responsible for making hydrology an experimental science. Life Perrault grew up in a bourgeois family, had at least seven siblings, and probably lived all his life in Paris. Little is known about his life, despite the fame of some of his younger brothers. These include Claude, an architect of part of the Louvre Palace; Nicholas, a doctor of theology known for his denunciation of the Jesuits; and Charles, author of Tales of Mother Goose. Perrault was trained as a lawyer, and in 1654 purchased the position of Receiver General of Finances for Paris. This post involved collecting taxes for Louis XIV, and he received a percentage of the taxes he collected. This position ruined him when Louis XIV chose to calm rebellious taxpayers by granting a remission of all taxes that were still owed after 10 years. Pierre had used some of his tax receipts for 1664 to pay creditors, and when he could not deliver the money to the royal treasury, he was forced into bankruptcy. After the bankruptcy Perrault became an amateur scientist and focused his attention on the origin of springs. The result of his labor was his book de l'Origine des fontaines (On the Origin of Fountains), published anonymously in 1674 and dedicated to his friend Christiaan Huygens. On the Origin of Springs In the millennia before Perrault published his book, most natural philosophers asserted that there was not enough precipitation to account for the flow in rivers and springs. Aristotle claimed that most of the water came from caverns in which air was transformed into water. Many others argued that seawater entered caverns, was heated until it rose as vapor, then condensed and fed springs, which in turn fed rivers. Although some philosophers such as Anaxagoras had more realistic models of the hydrologic cycle, the weight of authority was behind the more fanciful theories. Perrault devoted the first part of his book, On the Origin of Springs, to analyzing the ideas of his predecessors and what he called the \\"Common Opinion\\", rejecting most of it. He estimated the flow in the Seine River and compared it with rainfall in the watershed, showing that the rainfall was easily enough to account for the flow in the river. This conclusion was later supported by a more rigorous quantitative analysis published by Edme Mariotte. With a series of experiments, Perrault showed that rain does not penetrate the soil beyond about . Thus, most of the rain that falls does not go into springs. Perrault went on to develop the theory of the hydrologic cycle, correctly accounting for the roles of evaporation, transpiration, throughflow and surface runoff.

Alanssi set himself on fire in front of the White House on November 15, 2004. A note he wrote to his FBI handler at the time said he had to travel to Yemen to see his sick wife before he testified in a major terrorism prosecution in 2005. Alanssi was the sole informant in that case, which involved various counts of material support of terrorism against Mohammed Ali Hassan Al-Moayad and his assistant. At the trial, Alanssi was not called by the prosecution, but appeared as a hostile witness for Al-Moayad's defense. __TOC__  Early life  Alanssi was born in Yemen in 1952. He worked for a time at the U.S. Embassy in Sana'a in the mid-1970s and came to the U.S. on a tourist visa on July 23, 2001. Alanssi came to the attention of federal investigators after an arrest in October 2001 involving Yemenis sending money from the U.S. back to Yemen. He began work with his handler Robert Fuller as a FBI informant in November 2001.  Investigation  Alanssi was sent by the FBI to Yemen three times in 2002 to talk to Shiek Mohammed Ali Hassan al- Moayad, who was suspected of having terrorist ties. Alanssi had previously known al-Moayad in Yemen as a neighbor and as a worshiper in al-Moayad's mosque. Alanssi convinced al-Moayad to travel to Frankfurt, Germany in January 2003 to meet a potential donor for Islamic fundamentalist causes. Alanssi bought airline tickets for Moayad and his assistant, booked them into the hotel in Frankfurt and provided about $500 for extra expenses, including visas from the German Embassy in Sana'a. mirror During several meetings over 2 or 3 days, Alanssi served as a translator for the undercover FBI agent posing as a wealthy former Black Panther. The meeting was audio- and video-recorded by the FBI and Al-Moayad and his assistant were arrested and extradited to the U.S. to face charges. In the reporting of the arrest, Alanssi's name was leaked and appeared in the Yemeni press. He was paid around $100,000 dollars by the FBI during 2003. In November 2004, Alanssi contacted the Washington Post to discuss his work as a FBI informant in a series of interviews. He related to the paper that he was very unhappy with his treatment by the FBI and he was desperate to travel to Yemen to see his wife, who was sick with stomach cancer. On the morning of November 15, 2004, he informed the Post that he was going to \\"burn my body at unexpected place.\\" Alanssi approached a White House guardhouse that afternoon and asked that a note be delivered to President Bush. After he was turned away, he used a lighter to set his jacket on fire. Secret Service officers wrestled him to the ground and put out the flames with fire extinguishers. Alanssi suffered severe burns over 30% of his body. A note he had earlier sent to FBI agent Fuller and the Washington Post read: At that time, Alanssi was the prosecution's star witness in the material support of terrorism case against Al-Moayad and his assistant, Mohammed Mohsen Yahya Zayed. Alanssi eventually testified at that trial in February 2005, although as a hostile witness for the defense. Al-Moayad was convicted of five counts of material support to a foreign terrorist organization and sentenced to 75 years. The conviction was eventually overturned in 2008. Alanssi pleaded guilty to bank fraud charges in May 2004. He was given five years probation in April 2005. The FBI asked that he be allowed to travel overseas occasionally, to which the judge agreed. Alanssi was the key witness for an investigation that produced arrests in 2006 against four Muslim-Americans, Abdulrahman Farhane, Tarik Shah, Rafiq Sabir, and Mahmud Faruq Brent. The taped conversations between Farhane and Alanssi which formed the center of the investigation occurred in Farhane's Brooklyn bookstore in October 2001.

From the book The Illustrated Li Sao, illustrated by Xiao Yuncong, and inscribed by Tang Yongxian. Note that the title in the upper right is somewhat cut off due to some reason related to the historical preservation of the original before it was pasted down on a new sheet of paper. The Heavenly Questions or Questions to Heaven () is a piece contained in the Classical Chinese poetry collection of Chu Ci, which is noted both in terms of poetry and as a source for information on the ancient culture of China, especially the area of the ancient state of Chu. Of all the poems attributed to Qu Yuan, \\"Tianwen\\" contains more myths than any of the other pieces which may be attributed to him; however, due to the formal structure of \\"Tianwen\\" as a series of questions, information regarding the myths alluded to appear more as a series of allusive fragments than as cohesively narrated stories.Yang 2005, 8-10 According to legend, Qu Yuan wrote this series of questions in verse after viewing various scenes depicted on temple murals;Hinton 2008, 58Yang 2005, 8-9 specifically, it is said that following his exile from the royal court of Chu, Qu Yuan looked upon the depictions of the ancestors and the gods painted upon the walls of the ancestral temple of Chu; and, then, in response, wrote his questions to Heaven, upon these same walls.Yang 2005, 8-9 Description The Heavenly Questions consists of a series of verses, in question format, addressed to Tian, or Heaven. The 172Yang 2005, 9 questions asked revolve around Chinese mythology and ancient Chinese religious beliefs, and perceived contradictions or conundrums existing therein. That the Tianwen consists in questions rather than answers is somewhat of a problem for mythographers. Nevertheless, the questions themselves open up informative windows into a world of ancient mythology. The informational questions raised by Tianwen are a factor that contributes to the description of Tianwen as \\"the written treasure of Chinese mythology\\",Yang 2005, 182 or as \\"the most valuable document in Chinese mythology\\" (Birrell 1993, 26). Style The poetic style of the \\"Heavenly Question\\" is markedly different from the other sections of the Chuci collection, with the exception of the \\"Nine Songs\\" (\\"Jiuge\\"). The poetic form of the \\"Heavenly Questions\\" is the four-character line, more similar to the Shijing than to the predominantly variable lines generally typical of the Chuci pieces, the vocabulary is also differs from most of the rest of the Chuci, sharing more in common with works in the wisdom tradition like the Daodejing. David Hinton finds that these features of the work suggest that the \\"Heavenly Questions\\" has ancient sources in the oral tradition, although perhaps having been put together into its present form by Qu Yuan.Hinton 2009, 55-56 Hinton finds that much of the power of the poetic impact of the \\"Heavenly Questions\\" derives from \\"its fragmentary and enigmatic character\\" combined with a pervasive sense of mystery throughout the poem.Hinton 2008, 56 Content The content of the \\"Tianwen\\" includes questions regarding various myths, which today are often important informational sources on the historical development of these myths, with the \\"Tianwen\\" representing some of the earliest textual bases of information regarding these myths. Influence Wang Xiaolong's 2007 series: Tao's Queries. The \\"Heavenly Questions\\" was an influence on the later works of the Chuci. David Hinton sees the \\"Heavenly Questions\\" and the \\"Nine Songs\\" as introducing a \\"shamanistic world from the folk tradition\\" into the literary tradition of Chinese poetry: appearing in form close to the older, oral tradition in \\"Heavenly Questions\\" and the \\"Nine Songs\\", these voices from the shamanic world were transformed into poetry of \\"self-conscious individual authorship\\" with a personal voice in the \\"Li Sao\\".Hinton 2008, 57 Other examples of the influence of the Heavenly Questions include the poem written by Li He, which A. C. Graham translates as \\"Don't Go Out of the Door\\", which then in turn influenced the lyrics of the Pink Floyd song \\"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\\", attributed to Roger Waters. This translation by Graham features the line: \\"Witness the man who raved at the wall as he wrote his questions to Heaven\\".Graham 1977, 118. Note that the lower case \\"q\\" in \\"questions\\" is the accurate quotation. Thus, beginning with the \\"Heavenly Questions\\" contained in the Chu Ci anthology of the third or fourth century BCE, then progressing to the eighth or ninth century work of Li He influenced by Qu Yuan's \\"Heavenly Questions\\", and continuing on into the twentieth century with Graham's translation, and through the subsequent use of this motif by Roger Waters in the lyrics for a song by the popular music band Pink Floyd, and then subsequently as cover versions of that song in the twenty- first century, \\"Heavenly Questions\\" has had a long and enduring influence upon poetry and song. American poet Gjertrud Schnackenberg used the title Heavenly Questions for her elegy of six linked poems on the death of her husband Robert Nozick in 2002. The work won the Griffin Poetry Prize in 2011. The title was taken from the Chinese poem. China's interplanetary exploration program is named after \\"Heavenly Questions\\" (Tianwen) and the first mission Tianwen-1 was launched on July 23, 2020.

Each drains tea into a waste reservoir under the table. Chinese armchair made from roots. Qing dynasty, Qianlong era, 18th century Root carving is a traditional Chinese art form. It consists of carving and polishing tree roots into various artistic creations. History Using roots to make necessities has been practiced since primitive society. Like other artistic crafts, art of roots produced from primitive labor. The earliest root carvings are ‚ÄúËæüÈÇ™‚Äù and ‚ÄúËßíÂΩ¢Âô®‚Äù showing up in the Warring States period. In the Sui and Tang dynasties, root carving works not only prevailed in folk, but they were also cherished by the governing class. In the Tang dynasty, people laid emphasis on the natural forms of roots, cleverly taking advantage of the effect of corrosion and moth- eaten. In the Song and Yuan dynasties, art of root carving not only developed in the court and folk, but also appeared in grottoes and temples. Roots were used to carve the statues of the Buddha, always comparing favorably with the clay. Features A craftsman works on a piece in Haikou City, Hainan Province. His shop is located in an area beside East Lake, part of Haikou People's Park. The area contains dozens of small shops dedicated to producing root carvings. Root carving preserves natural beauty. Ancient artists created lifelike and vivid works by a special technique using expression based on the roots' natural forms. This kind of creation is not completely artificial, but created by both human beings and nature. Root carving is different from engraving, as it combines peculiarity with ingeniousness. Although its aesthetic principals share common ground with engraving, at the same time they are applied uniquely. The common ground is that they share expressive techniques of wood carving, sculpture, stone carving and so on, overcoming weaknesses by acquiring others strong points. The difference lies in the natural shape of roots. During the creative process, root carving mostly maintains the natural form of the root, adding some artificial polishing. In other words, root carving is guided by the inherent qualities of the root, rather than by strictly carving images. Necessities Creative effect achieved from the same material can vary from artist to artist. Within the field three factors are considered of major importance. *Uniqueness of the root - To some degree, root carving is an act of discovery. Finding and working with a unique root is half of the task and requires experience and a keen aesthetic vision. *Cultural foundation - Rich cultural foundation, referring to the overall creative process, highlights the natural beauty of the root. *Craftsmanship - The natural beauty of roots can be realized from a fertile imagination and a high degree of composition.

The species is endemic to the San Antonio, Texas area of the United States. It is one of nine species deemed the Bexar County Invertebrates, as all nine are found in similar cave environments in the central region of Texas.Cicurina baronia. The Nature Conservancy. These species range in size from one millimetre to one centimetre. They are also eyeless or essentially eyeless and pale in coloration.  Habitat  The Bexar County Invertebrates are troglobites, species which spend their entire lives in subterranean environments, inhabiting karst limestone caves and mesocaverns. Currently, these species have only been found in the karst areas in Bexar county, which were deemed critical habitats to the species in a 2012 ruling.Federal Register. 2012. Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Designation of Critical Habitat for Nine Bexar County, TX, Invertebrates. Department of the Interior. Fish and Wildlife Service. C. baronia specifically has only been positively identified in the Robber Baron Cave and one other cave in Alamo heights (Bexar County Distribution). Nutrient sources in this environment include leaf litter, animal droppings, and animal carcasses, making the cave ecosystem very dependent on the habitat on the surface. Troglobites also require stable temperatures and high humidity, with the cave temperature typically being close to the annual surface temperature but with much less variation. Relative humidity in the caves is normally near 100%.  Conservation  C. baronia is one of nine invertebrates endemic to the karst caves of Bexar County that were federally listed as endangered species in the year 2000.USFWS. Draft Bexar County Karst Invertebrates Recovery Plan. Federal Register May 16, 2008. All of the Bexar County Invertebrates face high degrees of threat but vary in their potential for recovery. A five-year review was published in 2011 alongside a recovery plan for the nine species. They did not change the overall classification of the species, but recommended lowering the recovery priority number for C. baronia and Texella cokendolpheri to 5C, compared to the 2C of the other seven species. The reason for this lowered recovery priority is because the likelihood that the species can recover is low considering that it is known from only two caves and occurs in an area that is highly urbanized.U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 2011. 5-Year Review: Summary and Evaluation. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service: Austin Ecological Field Office, Austin, TX. The species faces serious threats of habitat destruction due to urbanization and human activity on the surface where the cave entrances are located. Nonnative fire ants also present a threat to this species as they have the same habitat and nutrient sources.  Conservation threats  Habitat destruction and interference is the major threat to this species because of the high levels of urbanization in the cave areas. Some ways in which the habitat has been impacted include being filled with cement during construction, quarrying activities, and sealing of cave entrances. These activities lead to loss of the already limited habitat range. Human traffic is also a threat with the high levels of urbanization surrounding the cave's entrances, but organizations such as the Texas Cave Management Association and the Friends of Robber Baron have worked to limit the number of people who are allowed in the areas around cave entrances. Changes to the surface habitat also affect the cave habitat as altered drainage patterns and plant and animal compositions contribute to the degradation of the habitat. = Recovery strategy = The current recovery strategy is from September 2011, and applies to all nine Bexar County invertebrate species. The plan primarily involves the protection of karst areas to ensure the long-term survival of the species. Protections such as keeping the caves and their entrances free from human disruptions such as construction and excessive visitations, as well as protection from nonnative fire ants. Maintenance of the surface habitat is also important, as the underground habitat is dependent on it. The main habitat for C. baronia and several of the Bexar County Invertebrates, Robber Baron Cave, is only open to the public during semi-annual events to prevent further habitat destruction. One problem faced when creating a recovery plan is the inability to determine an accurate population estimate for the species. The habitat, size, and behaviors of the species makes it difficult to find and identify. Without information of past or present population sizes, it is difficult to determine the exact threat the species is under and what conservation efforts will be the most effective. The same plan is proposed for all nine of the Bexar County Karst Invertebrate due to a general lack of knowledge about many of the species. Because many elements of these species are unknown, increased research is a vital component of the recovery strategy. More information and insight into the behaviors and habitat of these species will allow for more concentrated and helpful conservation efforts.

History The idea for the community originated in a University of Chicago dorm room in September 2004, where Weardrobe co-founder Suzanne Xie kept track of everything she had in her closet via a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. In late 2007, she, along with friend and co-founder Rich Tong, noted that there was no application to organize clothing online and began discussing the possibility of developing such a forum. Their discussions spawned the basis for Weardrobe, and the site officially went online in January 2008. In 2009, Weardrobe was named one of 20 winners of Facebook's fbFund Competition for startups and nonprofit companies, and was invited to participate in Facebook's Summer Incubator Program in Palo Alto, California. There, Xie and Tong worked on integrating Facebook Connect with the online fashion network so users could see which of their friends were on the site and include those friends' activity through Facebook news feeds. The founders also created a partnership with Urban Outfitters where the company sends clothing out to specific Weardrobe users. The individuals then post images of the items styled to their preference, before sending the clothing back to the company. On November 18, 2009, the community was acquired by Like.com. Accordingly, the site has undergone several changes, including the addition of search functionality that allows readers to find and purchase similar articles of clothing if they so desire. Subsequently, Like.com was acquired by Google on August 20, 2010 for a rumored price of $100,000. The reasoning is said to be for the strength of visual search within the database of Like.com, which now supports Boutiques.com. Features As a street fashion community, Weardrobe provides members with the opportunity to create their own user profiles and post photographs of themselves. Users also have the ability to comment on others' photographs and send messages to each other, increasing the site's networking functionality. Furthermore, members can create and view a virtual representation of their real-life closet by tagging clothing in the images that they upload to the site and translating those articles into color-coded items for organizational purposes. One of the site's most recently added features is an extension of Likesense (Like.com's visual search capabilities). It aesthetically identifies items in a given outfit photograph, culls similar ones from one of Like.com's 5000 suppliers, and then displays the results to the user with the option for them to purchase those articles. This allows people to easily buy replicas of clothing that they see and like in the site's photographs, even though the piece in the outfit might have originally been a vintage one-of-a-kind. Likesense first displays two items, and if one of the two is clicked, further variations on that piece of clothing are shown. Currently, it only runs this process on the front page, which displays daily featured looks; however, there are plans to expand so that the entire site will eventually be searchable with Like.com. Community On occasion, the site sponsors contests in which members submit photographs of outfits based on given themes. Sometimes, Weardrobe pairs up with other fashion-related sites such as Modcloth and Market Publique - both online vintage American retailers - to offer different prizes for winning. Weardrobe's collaboration with Modcloth, the Mod Honor Roll Contest, asked for members' favorite back-to- school inspired outfits; the prize for the top three submissions included a special Modcloth outfit that the bloggers then styled and modeled. Their collaboration with Market Publique, Time After Time, asked for vintage- inspired outfit entries and the winner was flown into Brooklyn for a photo shoot session with Market Publique. Modcloth also held another competition in which they supplied the New York City Weardrobe community with a vintage black Modcloth dress (called the \\"Weardrobe Dress\\") and asked the members to come up with ways to style it. The dress was a simple black garment, and contestants submitted photos of how they would style an outfit around the piece. In its collaboration with other fashion-focused sites, Weardrobe provides a platform where people interested in fashion can come together and demonstrate their creativity and knowledge. It also provides an outlet for fashion-related sites to show off their clothing items to a specified online niche with similar interests. =Weardrobe Conference= In early September 2009, Weardrobe sponsored a conference in New York City for 19 popular fashion bloggers - many of whom have been featured in Teen Vogue, New York Magazine, and Lucky Magazine, and whose sites collectively receive 5 million page views a month. There, the bloggers participated in a DIY (Do It Yourself) exercise in customizing a pair of Solana Extreme Skinny Jeans, which were voted the #1 Jean of the Summer by Seventeen Magazine for 2009. The conference was meant to create a space for some of the fashion industry's most active style bloggers (including the minds behind the sites Style Rookie, Calivintage, The Clothes Horse, The Glamourai, What I Wore, This Time Tomorrow, and Fashion is Poison) to collaborate and exchange ideas about fashion. =Notable Members= Weardrobe has previously been known to hire staff from among their notable members, including Krystal Bick from This Time Tomorrow, who acted as the site's community manager, and Jessica Quirk of the blog What I Wore, who served as community director and also did some creative work, including writing and illustrating weekly contest images. Since the launch of her online blogging career, Quirk has also written a book entitled What I Wore: Four Seasons, One Closet, Endless Recipes for Personal Style, in which she answers frequently asked style questions, features several of her own favorite outfits and illustrations, and gives tips for organizing a closet. Similar Websites There are other sites with similar features and goals to Weardrobe, such as Closet Couture. Weardrobe contributors are sometimes also contributors on Chictopia or Lookbook. The two communities, like Weardrobe, offer \\"the common fashionista\\" the ability to publicly post their looks to an online community of people interested in fashion. The sites also contain photo blogs and competitions for online contributors.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places listings in McCulloch County, Texas in 1975, and became a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 1976. In 1963, the Texas Historical Commission designated the geographical center of Texas as being located northwest of Brady. The old jail became the Heart of Texas Historical Museum in 1974. A granite monument to the center of Texas can be found on the grounds of the McCulloch County Courthouse. History What is known as the Old McCulloch County Jail is actually the second structure to serve as the county jail. The first jail was built soon after the county's 1876 official organization, the structure having been completed in 1878. The construction on the first jail proved to be of poor quality, and McCulloch's prisoners were eventually incarcerated in Mason and San Saba. A new facility was approved by the Commissioner's Court in 1908, and completed in 1910 at a cost of $14,418.75. Construction of the three- story, red brick Richardson Romanesque facility was done by Southern Structural Steel Company of San Antonio. The second floor housed the prisoners, while the first floor served as living quarters for the sheriff and his family, or for the deputies. The third floor consists of twin towers. The underside of the third floor had a hanging ring, with a second floor trap door to facilitate death by hanging. In both 1936 and 1938, Brady Creek (San Saba River) overflowed its banks and caused the living quarters to be flooded. When the county decided to build a newer facility in 1974, this jail became known as the Old McCulloch County Jail. Heart of Texas Historical Museum The old jail now houses the Heart of Texas Historical Museum. In 1974, McCulloch County built a new jail, and the non-profit Heart of Texas Historical Museum, Inc purchased the old jail for $5.00 Restoration of the old jail was completed by 1976 with private donations and matching funds from the State of Texas. The museum received its own Recorded Texas Historic Landmark status in 1976, separate from the RTHL designated to the old jail.

It runs from Halmtorvet next to Copenhagen Central Station in the north east to the Carlsberg district in the southwest. History Ludvig Both: The extension of Stormgade, Old Railway, on 27 June 1884 S√∏nder Boulevard follows the initial stretch of Denmark's first railway, the West Line between Copenhagen and Roskilde, which opened in 1847. In 1864, the rail line was moved to a more northern course, through Frederiksberg, before being moved to its current position just south of S√∏nder Boulevard in 1911. The portion of the abandoned railway terrain closest to the city was transformed into a broad street in the emerging Vesterbro district. A direct continuation of Stormgade the street was given the name Ny Stormgade (New Storm Street).In 1905., the street was refurbished and renamed S√∏nder Boulevard. The name complemented those of Vester Boulevard (West Boulevard, now H. C. Andersens Boulevard and N√∏rre Boulevard (North Boulevard, now N√∏rre Voldgade). S√∏nder Boulevard was long a dilapidated thoroughfare dominated by traffic. The elm trees which originally lined it were hit by Dutch elm disease and had to be removed. After Halmtorvet was refurbished between 1999 and 2003, S√∏nder Boulevard was given similar treatment from 2005 to 2007. The project was designed by SLA. Design and facilities The playground on a misty autumn day The boulevard has sections with different forms of vegetation such as lawns and perennial gardens. Facilities include a playground with a shipwreck theme, a ball cage, a track for BMX bikes and seating areas with very different ambiences. Buildings Most of the boulevard is lined with typical Copenhagen five- storey residential buildings from the late 19th and early 20th century. Absalon's Church (No. 73) was completed in 1934 to design by Arthur Wittmaack. Wittmaack had already designed the cinema Boulevard Teatret which opened at No. 79-81 in 1924. In 1965, it was taken over by Peter Refn og Knud Hauge and operated as Copenhagen's first art cinema under the name Camera. It closed after Refn took over Grand Teatret in 1974. Public art, monuments and memorials No. 106: Commemorative plaque A plaque on No. 106 commemorates that a stray British bomb hit No. 106 and exploded during Operation Carthage on 21 March 1945, killing 11 people in the building. Transport Copenhagen Central Station and Carlsberg station are located close to each end of the street. Enghave Plads Station on the Copenhagen Metro City Circle Line will open close to the junction with Flensborggade and Ny Carlsberg Vej in 2019.

It is the fourth episode of the show's eighth season and was broadcast on October 16, 2011. Plot Bree's daughter Danielle and her son come to stay with her when her marriage fails (as Bree predicted it would). Danielle says she will be starting her own business selling exercise equipment, though it turns out that Danielle was actually selling sex toys such as sex swings rather than actual work-out equipment. After arguing, Bree sees that her once-lackadaisical daughter is finally committed to a career and offers to support her endeavor as a very silent, invisible, anonymous partner. Gaby, frustrated with the drop-off system at Juanita's school, gets her pass taken away by the obnoxious and rude drop-off supervisor, Dana. Thus, she must park at the \\"B Lot\\" and walk Juanita to class. She finds out from other moms that she may never get her pass back, and they plot to stand up against Dana at the Parent-Teacher Association meeting. But when Dana bribes the other moms by giving them back their passes, Gaby is left to fend for herself, resulting in her being sent to the \\"C Lot.\\" Determined to get revenge on Dana, she drives through the drop-off zone without a pass, crushing several pylons. When she watches Juanita walk off, she accidentally hits Dana with her car. As she visits Dana in the hospital, who has a broken back, she asks Gaby to assume her role as supervisor and PTA president while she recovers. Gaby, who is not up for that role, kindly turns it down. However, Dana threatens to press charges against Gaby unless she assumes her role. This is strictly for revenge. Dana tells Gaby she was once very much like her, but the overly demanding job turned her into the shrewish martinet she now is‚Äîcosting her both husband and friends. Desperate, Gaby has no choice but to agree. Susan begins taking an art class taught by Andre Zeller. She shows him her illustrations, however, he says that they are not what he looks for in art. As he continuously tells Susan that she could never become an artist like himself because of her rather \\"Soccer Mom\\" appearance, Susan proves him wrong by angrily splattering paint all over.

The comic centers around Foreskin Man, a superhero who saves babies from being circumcised and fights their would-be circumcisers. Foreskin Man was created by Matthew Hess, the author of a proposed bill to ban non- medically necessary circumcisions of minors, during a 2010-2011 campaign to ban this procedure in San Francisco. The comic received criticism from advocates on both sides of the circumcision debate for its use of anti-Semitic imagery. Background In 2010, intactivists (activists against infant circumcision) began an initiative to put a measure on San Francisco's November 2011 ballot that would ban all non-medically necessary circumcisions of minors. The effort was spearheaded by intactivist group Bay Area Intactivists, which used a bill whose text was written by Matthew Hess, the founder of San Diego-based intactivist website MGMbill.org (MGM being an acronym for \\"male genital mutilation\\", a term used by some intactivists to denounce circumcision). Hess also published Foreskin Man, a comic about a superhero who fights circumcisers and saves babies from them. In the comic, which currently has seven issues, superhero Foreskin Man battles enemies and saves boys from circumcisions in a variety of situations including hospital circumcisions, religious circumcisions, and tribal circumcisions.  Plot  Foreskin Man's alter ego is Miles Hastwick, a former corporate scientist now curator of the Museum of Genital Integrity. He is adamantly against the practice of circumcision. In the first issue, Hastwick comes up with the alter ego of Foreskin Man to fight against practitioners of circumcision and \\"the pro- circumcision lobby,\\" whom he feels have gained too much power through \\"all of the well connected doctors and lawyers.\\" In the second issue, Foreskin Man encounters and fights a \\"Monster Mohel\\". In the third issue of the comic, he teams up with a female heroine, dubbed \\"Vulva Girl,\\" who fights to oppose female genital mutilation. Together, they travel to Kenya to stop tribal circumcisions. In the fourth issue, he travels to Turkey to prevent the teenage son of a belly dancer from receiving an Islamic circumcision.Jennifer Lipman, \\"Foreskin Man is back to battle Muslim circumcision\\", The Jewish Chronicle, April 5, 2013.Debra J. Saunders, \\"Foreskin Man goes to Turkey\\", San Francisco Chronicle, April 4, 2013. The fifth issue shows him battling against the head of a company that collects foreskins for use in cosmetics and, in the sixth issue, he goes to the Philippines to disrupt a tuli rite. Accusations of anti-semitism In the second issue of the comic, Foreskin Man attends a brit milah and battles a \\"Monster Mohel\\". (Brit milah refers to a Jewish circumcision ceremony, while mohel refers to a Jewish ritual circumciser.) This imagery drew criticism from both sides of the circumcision debate. Abby Porth of the Jewish Community Relations Council called the comic \\"deeply alarming\\" and pointed out that \\"Monster Mohel\\" was portrayed in a way that resembled images used by the Nazis in anti-Semitic propaganda. The American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California argued in an amicus brief against the ban that Foreskin Man was evidence that the initiative was actually motivated by anti-Semitism. Nancy Appel of the Anti-Defamation League stated that the comic had \\"polarized and isolated, and that people who may have been willing to hear their side are just disgusted\\". In addition to being denounced by defenders of circumcision, Foreskin Man was also criticized by activists against the practice. Lloyd Schofield, the leader of the initiative to place the circumcision ban on the ballot, called the comic \\"a distraction at best\\", described it as \\"inflammatory and 180 degrees different from the direction we want to go in\\", and had wanted Hess to remove it from MGMBill.org. In response to criticism, Hess asserted that his comic did not focus on Judaism; rather, it dealt with a variety of settings and circumcisers including circumcisions performed by doctors, religious circumcisions, and tribal circumcisions.

She studied Information Systems at Boston College where she attended on a track scholarship. Describing her degree she has said, \\"Information systems is all about how companies use technology for competitive advantage...translated into art, I'm asking how I can use information to create meaning.\\" Andrew worked in silicon valley at both Intuit and Google. After working there from 2010‚Äì2012, she left Google to become a painter. She has claimed to have developed her artistic technique by watching how to videos on YouTube. The idea that one can learn about all topics on the Internet was the motto of her artistic series \\"How to How to How to\\". From 2012‚Äì2017 she apprenticed with London-based figurative painter Billy Childish who is still her mentor. Work Gretchen Andrew's paintings explore and manipulate the functioning of search engines, particularly Google Search. Her first search engine art piece occurred accidentally when she would copy Billy Childish's paintings and title them as \\"After Billy Childish\\". Since internet technology was unable to grasp the nuance between original and facsimile, her versions popped up first when she searched for his paintings online. In 2018 Gretchen's work then focused on the political and social impact of search technology, exploring in a paper with The British Computer Society the implications for artificial intelligence. In 2018 she coined the term \\"search engine art\\" in a book she co-authored with Irini Papadimitriou through V&A; Digital Futures. In February 2019 Gretchen Andrew used her Internet Imperialism process to convince Google Image Search that images of her artwork are the most important visual content related to Frieze Los Angeles, the much-hyped international art fair.

It claims to be the world's most basic cell phone, allowing the user only to make and receive calls, with none of the features of modern smartphones such as a camera, Internet access and text messaging; the address book is a paper pad and a pen, built into the back of the device. It is built around the Keep It Simple concept. It was designed and developed by Hein Mevissen and Diederiekje Bok of Dutch advertising and design agency John Doe Amsterdam. It is marketed as being ideal for children, the elderly, and technophobes. Trivia In 2010 Fast Company wrote that John's Phone made it in the top 12 of the Year's Best Ideas in Interface Designs.

File:Johnsphone 3.jpgThere was room for a paper address book in the back of the phone.  Features  John's Phone features a 32-page paper address book kept on the back of the handset. It includes an ink pen that resembles a stylus, a notepad. The designers say that these features allow the phone to be used even when it is turned off. Also included is \\"text messaging\\" which is done in the paper booklet. Several pages have \\"Write your text message here\\" along with To, From and Message lines and a dotted vertical line for cutting them out. When the 1,200 mAh battery is full, the display will show the word \\"JOHNS\\" along the right. The lower the battery, the fewer letters are displayed.

Two fireplaces still exist in the home, and the home also contains a stone cellar. The Wentz home is one room wide and two stories tall. The front facade of the home is symmetrical. All bays have wooden sills and lintels. The house remains functional and structurally sound. =Peter Mastin Wentz= Born on July 3, of 1831 in Wayne County, Pennsylvania, Peter Wentz was born into Methodist lifestyle. He was one of eight children to his mother, Mercy Green. His father, also named Peter, was a Methodist minister. His family eventually encountered turmoil, due to the death of Peter's mother and the failure of finances within the family. Still in his youth, Peter had to leave home and education behind, apprenticing as a boot and shoemaker. In his twentieth year, Peter Wentz embraced the beliefs of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), converting into the religion. Desiring to be a part of the main mass of members of the church at that time, Wentz travelled to Nauvoo, Illinois then to St. Louis, Missouri, and eventually walked the long trail to Salt Lake City, Utah. Years later, in 1871, Peter served as a missionary for the church in New York. In the year 1857, Peter Wentz settled down in the city of Provo, where he employed himself in the boot and shoe business. For the next several year, Wentz carried goods, traded goods, and prospected in the state of Montana. Wentz married a woman by the name of Minerva Boren in 1864, and with her parented nine kids. Wentz continued on to be a great asset to the Provo community.

The NFLP granted a 10-year exclusive license to Reebok to manufacture and sell trademarked headwear bearing team insignia of all 32 teams.

Bree serves up some delicious, homemade soup for the homeless at the local shelter, but ends up enticing the local hipsters and pushing out those in need; Gaby finds herself without a staff to help set up a school event when her lackadaisical approach to her new job as president of the PBA insults the parent volunteers; Renee helps a reluctant Lynette get back into the dating pool by taking her to a singles bar; and Carlos finds himself hitting rock bottom when the guilt over murdering Gaby's stepfather begins to engulf him. Reception According to Nielsen ratings, \\"The Art of Making Art\\" was watched by 9.17 million viewers and held 3.0 rating between 18 and 49 years of age. The episode was competing against Sunday Night Football on NBC, which averaged 12.47 million viewers and a 5.2 rating/13 share, The Good Wife on CBS, which was watched by 9.77 million viewers but held a 2.0 rating, and Game 4 of the 2011 World Series on Fox which was watched by 15.16 million viewers and held 4.2/11 rating in the 18-49 demographic.. The ratings were up from the previous episode \\"School of Hard Knocks\\", which had set a series low in total viewers and in the 18-49 demographic. The slight increase in ratings was largely due to the lead in from the series premiere of Once Upon a Time at 8:00 pm Eastern/7:00 pm Central on ABC which was watched by 12.93 million viewers and received a 4.0 in the 18-49 demographic. The episode gained an additional 2.1 million viewers and 0.9 rating in the week following the original broadcast due to DVR recordings.

The disease affects the function or structure of the cerebellum region in the brain. Diagnosis Since the majority of ACA cases result from a post-viral infection, the physician‚Äôs first question will be to ask if the patient has been recently ill. From this point a series of exclusion tests can determine if the current state of ataxia is a correct diagnosis or not. A CT (computed tomography) scan with normal results can rule out the possibility of the presence of a posterior fossa tumor and an acute hemorrhage, which would both have abnormal results. Other imaging tests like EEG (electroencephalographs) and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) can also be performed to eliminate possible diagnoses of other severe diseases, such as neuroblastoma, drug intoxication, acute labyrinthitis, and metabolic diseases. A more complicated test that is performed for research analysis of the disease is to isolate viruses from the CSF (cerebrospinal fluid). This can show that the virus has attacked the nervous system of the patient and resulted in the ataxia symptoms. Differential diagnosis Differential diagnosis may include: * Opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia syndrome * Miller-Fisher syndrome * Meningoencephalitis * Cerebral abscess * Tumor * Hydrocephalus * Inner-ear disease * Acute vestibulitis * Acute labyrinthitis Symptoms Most symptoms of people with post-viral cerebellar ataxia deal to a large extent with the movement of the body. Some common symptoms that are seen are clumsy body movements and eye movements, difficulty walking, nausea, vomiting, and headaches. Causes Post-viral cerebellar ataxia is caused by damage to or problems with the cerebellum. It is most common in children, especially those younger than age 3, and usually occurs several weeks following a viral infection. Viral infections that may cause it include the following: chickenpox, Coxsackie disease (viral infection also called hand- foot-and-mouth disease), Epstein‚ÄìBarr virus (a common human virus that belongs to the herpes family) and HIV. Treatment Ataxia usually goes away without any treatment. In cases where an underlying cause is identified, medical treatment may be needed. In extremely rare cases, patients can have continuing and disabling symptoms. Treatment includes corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, or plasma exchange therapy. Drug treatment to improve muscle coordination has a low success rate. However, the following drugs may be prescribed: clonazepam, amantadine, gabapentin, or buspirone. Occupational or physical therapy may also alleviate lack of coordination. Changes to diet and nutritional supplements may also help. Treatment will depend on the cause. If the ataxia is due to bleeding, surgery may be needed. For a stroke, medication to thin the blood can be given. Infections may need to be treated with antibiotics. Steroids may be needed for swelling (inflammation) of the cerebellum (such as from multiple sclerosis). Cerebellar ataxia caused by a recent viral infection may not need treatment. Outlook (prognosis) People whose condition was caused by a recent viral infection should make a full recovery without treatment in a few months. Fine motor skills, such as handwriting, typically have to be practised in order to restore them to their former ability. In more serious cases, strokes, bleeding or infections may sometimes cause permanent symptoms. History Westphal reported the first documented case of post-viral cerebellar ataxia in 1872, where associations of reversible cerebellar syndrome were observed. Another early case was documented in 1905. Batten described in detail cases of post-infectious cerebellar ataxia in five children. The cause of the disease was unknown until 1978 when Weiss and Guberman proposed that ACA could be due to direct invasion of the central nervous system by infectious agents. Since then many case studies have followed to understand the underlying conditions, symptoms and causes of the disease. The largest study of retrospective childhood ACA was done in 1994 by Connolly. This disease is still commonly used as a reference in clinical practice for other inflammatory and autoimmune disorders of the nervous system.

Twelves House is a historic house located in Provo, Utah, United States. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  John R. Twelves House This home, located at 287 East 100 North, was built in 1906 by John R. Twelves. John R. Twelves was a central figure in Utah's history, being involved in the Grand Central Mining Company and serving as Utah County's treasurer and recorder. The John R. Twelves House was designated to the Provo City Historic Landmarks Registry on April 26, 1996. Starting in 1911 this was the residence of George H. Brimhall the president of Brigham Young University at the time.article on history of BYU's house of the president Since 2005, the Twelves House has been the home of independent filmmaker Richard Dutcher's Main Street Movie Company, a motion picture production and distribution company. The 9 foot marble sculpture of Jesus, which dominates the front lawn, is a prop which plays prominently in Dutcher's film Falling. = The Victorian Mansions of Provo = \\"Constructed between 1893 and 1908 in Provo, Utah, these Victorian mansions reflect the wealth and personality of Utah's most successful entrepreneurs of the time. These mansions include the Charles E. Loose House, the William H. Ray House, the Knight-Allen House, the John R. Twelves House, the Jesse Knight House, the Knight-Mangum House, and the Thomas N. Taylor House. \\"Built during the turn of the century from 1893 to 1908, the domestic residences of Provo's prominent entrepreneurs reflect the wealth, power, and aesthetic taste of their owners and of America's Gilded Age. Larger in size, more complicated in their massing, and ornate in their detailing than the typical residences of Provo, these houses are the Victorian mansions of the city. All derive from the high style popular at the end of the nineteenth century: Eastlake, Italianate, Shingle, Craftsman, Moorish, and the Classical, Romanesque and Colonial Revivals. Although the high styles are of a purer form in these houses than is usually found in Provo, an eclectic attitude still dominates with several styles often being combined into one residence. Characteristic of all these buildings is a compactness and a low earth-hugging quality, which is typical of Provo's architecture but antithetical to the optimistic verticality of Salt Lake's Victorian buildings. As is true of the majority of Provo's residences, these houses are made primarily of brick, including elaborate ornamental coursing and trim. The Victorian fascination with a variety of rich materials is visible only in the use of masonry in the foundations, lintels and arches of these buildings and in the extensive use of leaded and stained glass in the windows. Some of the most ornate fenestration to be found in Provo is contained in these buildings. In comparison to the buildings in Salt Lake City, these Victorian mansions are modest in size, style, and materials, but are more reflective of the high styles than those generally found in Utah's small towns such as Manti or Spring City (National Register of Historic Places Inventory‚ÄîNomination Form).\\" = Jesse Knight and The Tintic Mining Industry = The successful commercial mining of precious metals and minerals transformed Utah's economy from basically an agrarian base to a more industrialized state. Within this development the Tintic Mining District, located approximately thirty miles southwest of Provo, was founded in 1869 and by 1899 became the leading mining center in Utah with a value of output placed at $5 million. A central figure in Tintic success was Jesse Knight and the Knight family who resided in Provo. Jesse Knight attained wealth with his Humbug mine in the mid-1890s. The large silver producer allowed Knight to develop other mines in the East Tintic area. Knightsville grew around the workings and became touted as the only saloon-free, prostitute-free, privately owned mining camp in the U.S. His strict adherence to doctrines of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints made the town one inhabited primarily by members of that church. \\"Knight began to expand and diversify as mining in Tintic burgeoned. The Knight smelters at Silver City, power plant in Santaquin Canyon, Narrow gauge railway circumventing the district, Tintic drain tunnel projet, and the Knight dry farm all represented vast investments and profits (National Register of Historic Places Inventory‚ÄîNomination Form).\\" \\"With financial success Knight expanded with the result of securing coordination of his holdings and placing responsibility on family members by organizing the Knight Investment Company. This corporation included the Bonneville Mining company, Knight Woolen Mills (located in Provo), Ellison Ranching Company (Nevada), Spring Canyon Coal Company (Carbon County, Utah), and Savings Bank (Provo), Layton Sugar Company, American- Columbian Corporation, Springville-Mapleton Sugar Company, and the Tintic Drain Tunnel Company (National Register of Historic Places Inventory‚ÄîNomination Form).\\" John R. Twelves acquired a large amount of wealth from the mining business as well. As secretary-treasurer of the Grand Central Mining Company Twelves prospered as the stock for Grand Central rose. In 1902, Twelves had attained enough money to fund his home. =Preservation= The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 as part of a multiple property submission that nominated seven and listed six Provo houses. The listed houses are the Knight-Mangum House, this, the John R. Twelves House, the Jesse Knight House, the Knight-Allen House, the William H. Ray House, and the Thomas N. Taylor House. The seventh, the Charles E. Loose House, was determined to be NRHP-eligible but was not NRHP-listed due to owner objection. and  References  * 2002. \\"Historic Provo\\" Provo City Landmarks Commission. * Temme, Debbie/ Cannon, Ken/ Notarianni, Phil..

During their short career between 1981 and 1984 they released two LPs, a maxisingle, two EPs and three singles.  History  = Early Years = In 1981, brothers Lars and Per Mertanen formed the instrumental duo Cl√°usula Tenebrosa. After a show they started talking about the possibility of rehearsing with Carlos Entrena, a friend at the time and ex-singer of the recently split Ejecutivos Agresivos. In 1981, with some friends, they started the independent label Grabaciones Accidentales (GASA), so they could release their own records. = Quartet = In 1982, they decided to replace the drum machine by real drums and Jose Brena joined the band. 'Tan Lejos' was so well received by the radio that months later D√©cima V√≠ctima won The Maqueta de Oro (Golden Demo), an award voted by the listeners of Radio 3 (Radio Nacional de Espa√±a, Spain's National Public Broadcaster), as one of the favourite tracks of 1982. The sound, in spite of being played with only three instruments and voice, was as enveloping live as it was on record, thanks to the Mertanen Brothers' personal way of playing and to having, most of the times, Paco Trinidad as their sound engineer. Most of their live shows were in Madrid, but they also played in Barcelona, Vigo, Valencia, Puertollano and Molina de Arag√≥n. = The End = The band ended mainly for work reasons beyond their control. There were no musical or personal differences. They always were, above all, very good friends. Their last show was at Madrid's Rock-Ola on December 3, 1983.

Completed and commissioned in December 1942, she served in World War II, operating in the Solomon Islands campaign, New Guinea campaign, and central Pacific Ocean. She was sunk in May 1944 during her eleventh war patrol. Design and description The Ro-100 class was a medium-sized, coastal submarine derived from the preceding Kaich≈´ type. They displaced surfaced and submerged. The submarines were long, had a beam of and a draft of . They had a double hull and a diving depth of .Carpenter & Dorr, p. 123 For surface running, the boats were powered by two diesel engines, each driving one propeller shaft. When submerged each propeller was driven by a electric motor. They could reach on the surface and underwater. On the surface, the Ro-100s had a range of at ; submerged, they had a range of at .Chesneau, p. 204 The boats were armed with four internal bow torpedo tubes and carried a total of eight torpedoes. They were also armed with two single mounts for Type 96 anti-aircraft guns or a single L/40 AA gun.Bagnasco, p. 193 Construction and commissioning Ro-106 was laid down as Submarine No. 216 on 17 December 1941 by the Kure Naval Arsenal at Kure, Japan. She was renamed Ro-106 on 8 April 1942 and was launched on 30 May 1942. She was completed and commissioned on 26 December 1942. Service history Upon commissioning, Ro-106 was attached to the Sasebo Naval District and was assigned to Submarine Squadron 11. While on workups in the Hayase Seto off Kure on 15 February 1943, her rudder jammed and she ran aground and suffered hull damage. She was towed to Kure for repairs. On 15 March 1943, she was reassigned to Submarine Squadron 7 in the 8th Fleet in the Southeast Area Fleet. She departed Sasebo on 31 March 1943 bound for Rabaul on New Britain, which she reached on 12 April 1943. =First, second, and third war patrols= Ro-106 got underway from Rabaul on 22 April 1943 for her first war patrol, assigned a patrol area southeast of Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands. It was uneventful, and she returned to Rabaul on 14 May 1943. She put to sea to begin her second war patrol on 27 May 1943, but diesel engine trouble forced her to return to Rabaul on 29 May 1943. She began her third war patrol on 31 May 1943, bound again for a patrol area southeast of Guadalcanal. After another quiet patrol, she set course for Rabaul, which she reached on 16 June 1943. =Fourth war patrol= On 30 June 1943, the New Georgia campaign began with the U.S. landings on New Georgia, Rendova, and other islands in the central Solomons. Ro-106 departed Rabaul that day to begin her fourth war patrol, assigned a patrol area off Rendova. On 18 July 1943, she torpedoed the United States Navy tank landing ship in the Blanche Channel off New Georgia at . The torpedo blew LST-342 in half; her stern section sank immediately, but her bow section remained afloat and was towed to Purvis Bay, beached on Gavutu, and stripped of usable materials and equipment. Meanwhile, Ro-106 concluded her patrol with her return to Rabaul on 21 July 1943. =Fifth and sixth war patrols= Ro-106 set out from Rabaul on 31 July 1943 to begin her fifth war patrol. It was uneventful, and on 20 August 1943 she returned to Rabaul, where she was reassigned to the new Submarine Division 51 along with the submarines , , , , and , with Ro-105 serving as squadron flagship. She departed Rabaul on 1 September 1943 for her sixth war patrol, assigned a patrol area off San Cristobal in the southeastern Solomon Islands. She found no targets, and on 22 September 1943 received orders to divert from her patrol to rescue Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service aviators who had been shot down on 20 September. She then made for Rabaul, where she arrived on 24 September 1943. =New Guinea campaign= On 6 October 1943, Ro-106 departed Rabaul to carry supplies to Sarmi on the northern coast of New Guinea in support of Japanese forces fighting in the New Guinea campaign. She reached Sarmi on 7 October 1943, unloaded her cargo, and got back underway the same night. Rather than return to Rabaul, she received orders on 9 October 1943 to operate off Lae, New Guinea, conducting her seventh war patrol. She was off Lae on 19 October 1943 when an Allied plane spotted her and reported her to Allied warships, probably including the U.S. Navy destroyer , which reported depth-charging a submarine off Lae that day. She suffered serious damage in the depth-charge attacks the Allied ships conducted against her, and after calling at Rabaul from 23 to 27 October 1943 she proceeded to Sasebo, which she reached on 8 November 1943 to undergo repairs. With her repairs complete, Ro-106 departed Sasebo on 16 December 1943 bound for Rabaul, where she arrived on 29 December 1943. After a little over a month there, she set out for her second supply run to Sarmi on 1 February 1944. She called at Sarmi on 3 February and returned to Rabaul on 5 February 1944. Another supply run to Sarmi followed, with Ro-106 departing Rabaul on 10 February 1944, discharging her cargo on 12 February, and returning to Rabaul on 14 February 1944. =Eighth war patrol= On 19 February 1944, Ro-106 was reassigned to the 1st Advance Submarine Unit and set out from Rabaul for her eighth war patrol, ordered to operate within a radius of Natsushima at Truk to intercept U.S. Navy Task Force 58, which had made a major air and surface attack against Truk on 17‚Äì18 February 1944 in Operation Hailstone. She found no targets, and on 1 March 1944 received orders to move to the Eniwetok area. She conducted a periscope reconnaissance of Eniwetok on 4 March 1944 and found no ships there, but when she returned to reconnoiter the atoll again on 5 March 1944 she sighted what she reported as several cruisers, destroyers, and a repair ship there. She returned to Truk on 8 March 1944, the day on which Truk-based Mitsubishi G4M (Allied reporting name \\"Betty\\") bombers of the 705th Naval Air Group raided the anchorage at Eniwetok to attack the ships she had sighted. =Ninth and tenth war patrols= Two uneventful war patrols from Truk followed. Ro-106 began her ninth patrol on 17 March 1944, bound for a patrol area southeast of Truk and north of the Nomoi Islands. She called at Truk from 24 to 29 March 1944, then set out on her tenth war patrol, assigned a patrol area east of Eniwetok. She returned to Truk on 20 April 1944. She again sortied from Truk on 30 April 1944 to intercept an Allied task force, but found no enemy ships and returned to Truk on 3 May 1944. =Eleventh war patrol= Ro-106 got underway from Truk on 16 May 1944 for her eleventh war patrol, ordered to join the submarines , , , , , and in forming a submarine picket line north of the Admiralty Islands designated Scouting Line NA. The picket line was tasked with providing warning of any move toward the Palau Islands by Allied invasion forces. After Ro-106 departed Truk, the Japanese never heard from her again. On 18 May 1944, U.S. Navy signals intelligence personnel intercepted and decrypted Japanese signals indicating the formation of Scouting Line NA between Truk and the Admiralties. A U.S. Navy hunter- killer group composed of the destroyer escorts , , and departed Purvis Bay in the Solomon Islands to attack the submarines involved. =Loss= Ro-106 was on the surface north of the Admiralty Islands at 03:51 on 22 May 1944 when George established radar contact on her at a range of bearing 303 degrees from George. Shortly thereafter, England also detected Ro-106 on radar and assessed the contact as a surfaced submarine. While George and Raby closed the range, England steamed northeast to cut off Ro-106‚Ä≤s escape. Ro-106‚Ä≤s radar detector apparently did not detect the radar signals from the approaching destroyer escorts and was still on the surface when George illuminated her with searchlights at a range of . She crash-dived and began radical maneuvers to disrupt and confuse the sonars aboard the destroyer escorts and avoid hits by their antisubmarine weapons. George achieved sonar contact on her at 04:10 and fired a barrage of Hedgehog projectiles, but missed. At 04:25, England detected Ro-106 on sonar at a range of bearing 193 degrees from England. England launched an unsuccessful Hedgehog attack, then opened the range, turned back, and closed for another attack. Ro-106 also reversed course and approached England head-on. England made her second Hedgehog attack at 05:01, resulting in three underwater explosions at a depth for . Ro-106 sank with all hands in of water at . On 15 June 1944, the Imperial Japanese Navy declared Ro-106 to be presumed lost north of the Admiralty Islands with all 49 men on board. The Japanese struck her from the Navy list on 10 August 1944.

The route connected Barrie with the town of Angus and CFB Borden. The highway was designated in 1937. During the early 1960s, the highway was realigned within Barrie in order to have it interchange with Highway 400; originally the route followed Tiffin Street. At the beginning of 1998, the entire highway was transferred to the City of Barrie and Simcoe County; it is now known as Simcoe County Road 90.  Route description  Highway 90 ended at the entrance to CFB Borden, for which it serves as the primary connection to Highway 400 Today, the former routing of Highway 90 is known as Dunlop Street within Barrie and Simcoe County Road 90 outside of the city. The route begins at a split between Cambrai Road, which provides access to Camp Borden, and Simcoe County Road 10, which continues south to Alliston and Tottenham. The four lane Simcoe County Road 90 progresses north through the centre of Angus. North of the Barrie Collingwood Railway overhead, it acts as the principal commercial strip for the town. North of Angus, the highway makes a broad 90-degree turn to the east and skims the southern edge of the Minesing Wetlands, an internationally significant bog. East of the swamp, the road enters Essa, where it intersects the Sunnidale Road (Simcoe County Road 40). From there to Barrie, the highway passes through a largely rural area. It intersects former Highway 131, now Simcoe County Road 27, then enters Barrie at Miller Drive, curving northeast. East of Ferndale Drive, the route crosses Highway 400 at Exit 96. Shortly thereafter, as it approaches the waterfront of Kempenfelt Bay, the route ends at High Street in downtown Barrie. Simcoe County Road 90 is two lanes wide between McKinnon Road, north of Angus, and Ferndale Drive in Barrie, although a passing lane is provided for eastbound traffic between Angus and Essa. The road also widens to four lanes briefly at the junction with former Highway 131 west of Barrie, as well as within the city and within Angus. The land use surrounding the route is mixed, with pastures and forests composing the majority of the setting. Residences and small businesses are also scattered throughout the length of the route.  History  Highway 90 was originally assumed by the Department of Highways (DHO), the predecessor to today's Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO), during the late 1930s. The primary purpose for the highway was to connect the CFB Borden military base at Angus with the main north‚Äìsouth routes of central Ontario. At that time, these were Highway 27 and Highway 11\\\\. On October 6, 1937, the DHO designated the Barrie to Angus Road as King's Highway 90. The initially unimproved road was paved shortly after the outbreak of World War II; a contract was awarded to Brennan Paving of Hamilton during the autumn of 1939, and work completed by the end of the year. Initially, Highway 90 followed Tiffin Street through Barrie, ending just short of the waterfront of Kempenfelt Bay at the intersection of Essa Street (Highway 27) and Bradford Street (Highway 11/27). However, during the early 1960s the route was modified so as to provide an interchange with Highway 400\\\\. A new interchange was constructed during the late 1950s at what was then known as Elizabeth Street in order to provide better access to downtown Barrie from the freeway. By 1960, Highway 90 had been rerouted northwest along Ferndale Drive and northeast along Elizabeth Street. Though it still ended at Bradford Street, it intersected it to the north. By 1961, Elizabeth Street was renamed as Dunlop Street West. By 1964, Dunlop Street was extended southwest of Ferndale Drive to merge with Tiffin Street at Miller Drive (the present city limits). Highway 90 approaching Barrie from the west The highway remained unchanged for over three decades, with the exception of a Connecting Link agreement established between the MTO and the City of Barrie. However, during the late 1990s, the MTO transferred many highways to lower levels of government as a cost-cutting measure. Highway 90 was transferred to Simcoe County on January 1, 1998. The Connecting Link through Barrie was also discontinued. Simcoe County has since renamed its portion of the route as Simcoe County Road 90.  Major intersections   Current construction  The current construction to widen the highway to 5 lanes could last until 2020.

The salt processing facility is operated by Dampier Salt Ltd, part of the Rio Tinto Group. Description The Important Bird Area (IBA) comprises a system of evaporation ponds, the intake zone where seawater enters, and the adjacent intertidal mudflats.

They released their debut album, Circle of Growth in 2002 and have released five albums to date, the latest release was the Chapters (2015). Guitarist and vocalist Pete Mac also recorded a solo acoustic album, In Limbo, which was released in 2009. History =1996‚Äì2002: Circle of Growth= After forming in 1996, Paradox spent the next few years fine-tuning their sound by recording several demos and playing the local circuit. In 2000 Paradox caught the attention of a California-based independent label and in December of that year they flew out to LA to record their debut album. Circle of Growth was recorded at Master Groove Studios in the Valley. The album was self-produced and also saw Pete and Mike playing all the instruments. Circle of Growth was released in September 2002. Circle of Growth has a raw sound and shows the band's musical influences, exhibiting elements of grunge, punk and garage rock. Reviews of the album compared it to Nirvana's Bleach and to bands like Alice in Chains and Soundgarden. Mike admitted the band's early influence: \\"The Seattle scene definitely impressed us, it was a big influence on the band.\\" An independent video was made for the album's only single, Infinite. The video, shot in the Nevada desert, was played on many TV stations in the US. The song was also played prominently on many college radio stations as well as major Irish stations such as Red FM and Cork's 96FM. During this time, Paradox continued to play gigs across their home country of Ireland; this included a performance at Sir Henry's in Cork. The band also headlined the IMRO Showcase Tour in 2001. In 2002, Paradox returned to the US. They played many venues, including the Battle of Bands Music Festival in Las Vegas, where, with almost 300 bands taking part, Paradox got through to the final and achieved third place in the competition. They were featured in many newspapers and magazines in Ireland, including Hot Press. =2003‚Äì2006: Sacred= Following the band's US tour they parted ways with their label. In January 2003 Paradox recorded six new songs at BPM Studios in Cork, Ireland. These tracks were initially released on The Sacred EP. A year later, Paradox returned to BPM Studios and recorded a further six songs. The 12 songs in total were then released as the band's second album, Sacred, on 11 May 2004. As with Circle of Growth, Pete and Mike played all the instruments: Pete on vocals, guitars and bass; Mike on Drums, vocal harmonies, keyboards and piano. Sacred marked a significant change for the band, moving away from the grunge/punk sound found on Circle of Growth to a more melodic alternative rock sound. Sacred received very positive feedback from fans as well as great reviews from online fanzines and radio stations. One review commented \\"The core of Paradox's sound is driven with passion and is reminiscent of the grunge/hard rock styles prevalent in middle America. The lyrics are quite insightful and are obviously something these gentleman put a lot of their heart and soul into. Pretend Friend, one of my favourites, displays their appreciation for the musical content of a song with their use of harmonies and a meaningful topic.\\" Another article added: \\"(Sacred) is an album of surprising maturity for such a young act - and a healthy spring board to success.\\" That year, Pete moved to London and Mike moved to Canada, meaning Paradox were initially unable to tour to promote the album's release. And, not for the first time, Paradox found themselves without a bass player. In 2005 Pete and Mike returned to Ireland and, joined by bass player Jon Finn, they were able to play some live shows, starting with a performance for Pulse Radio in Dublin. Pete then moved to Berlin, Germany and Paradox were soon playing shows across the country, including a few outdoor music festivals. Their debut show in Germany took place on 28 December 2006 at Rock at Sage, Sage Club, Berlin. =2008‚Äì2009: In Limbo= By 2008, many new songs had been written and were waiting to be recorded. Instead of going to a traditional recording studio, Pete recorded at home using a 4-track, two microphones, an acoustic guitar, bass and tambourine. Half of the album was recorded in his apartment in Berlin, while other songs were recorded in a bathroom. Added to these were three demos that were recorded on an old analogue 4-track in Ireland in 2005. Making the album took six months in total. The 12 songs were released as the album, In Limbo, in February 2009. Technically a Pete Mac acoustic solo album, In Limbo had a very different sound to the earlier Paradox albums. This new sound was well received by Paradox fans as well as helping to attract new listeners. The album received mostly positive reviews. The Grunge fanzine Minerva Corner in Portugal summed up the album as follows: \\"In Limbo is a simple / acoustic and direct album with some twists of electric guitar, nothing more added. It's natural and emotional as an intimite album should be... Nothing artificial, no masks, simply true!\\" Pete made videos for two of the album's songs, No Words and Pretend Friend. Pete played many solo acoustic shows in Berlin throughout 2009. As well as playing songs from In Limbo and acoustic versions of Paradox songs, he played covers of songs that helped inspire the In Limbo sound, such as Eddie Vedder's Society. =2010‚Äì2013: Corporate Pollution= In 2010 Pete and Mike got back together to rehearse material that had been written over the past five years, preparing for the band's first album since Sacred in 2004. Meanwhile, 'Downward Spiral', a track from Sacred, received a certificate award from the IAIRA (International Association of Independent Recording Artists). The track reached No. 4 in the international internet Top 10. The first Paradox UK tour was planned for July with 16 dates initially booked. After much confusion with the booking agency the plug got pulled on the whole tour just 3 weeks before it was meant to start. The band continued to pursue the tour themselves and managed to salvage 8 dates. The band recruited new bass player Jette Pille and began touring the UK. On their return to Ireland, they resumed rehearsals and then went to a secluded recording studio in County Kerry to work on the new album. Eleven songs were mixed in nine days at Data Recording Studios and these became the band's third album, Corporate Pollution, released on 15 March 2011. As with Circle of Growth and Sacred, Pete and Mike played all the instruments on the album. They also co-produced the album. Three of the songs on Corporate Pollution previously appeared on In Limbo but were re-recorded with a full band sound. Corporate Pollution marks a further evolution in the Paradox sound: on average six electric guitars were recorded along with triple vocal harmonies, two acoustic guitars, much bass, piano for certain tracks, a female vocal for one track and two days of drumming. One reviewer wrote that the album had \\"so many influences coming through here it‚Äôs impossible to list them all. This music is timeless, solid and to the point.\\" Another added: \\"Maybe the ultimate compliment you can pay to this album is that you could listen to it between Nirvana‚Äòs In Utero and Alice in Chains‚Äò Dirt and it‚Äôs every bit as good.\\" A video trailer for Corporate Pollution was made and was featured on websites such as NME. The album's first single was Mr. Bureaucracy. The song, which has been played on radio stations such as Irish station 2fm, received attention for its biting political lyrics set against fast, grungy riffs. Loud-Stuff.com said: \\"Politically charged from the outset these guys sound like a hybrid of Nirvana and Bush with a heavier edge to the music.\\" Mr Bureaucracy earned the band more recognition after the release of a music video in late 2012, with the following year seeing the song nominated for 'Best Song' at the Berlin Music Video Awards, as well as receiving additional nominations at the Portobello Film Festival in London and the Dublin International Short Film and Music Festival. The song was also included on the Drop-d: Cork City Rock Vol.2 compilation album. 2012 also so the band tour alongside the likes of Therapy?, Kerbdog, and Shonen Knife. In August 2011, shortly after Corporate Pollution's release, Paradox were nominated for the Arthur's Day - Play on the Day competition in conjunction with RT√â 2fm and Hot Press. In 2012 the Corporate Pollution track Repress Excess was used on the soundtrack for Canadian horror movie Truth. =2014‚Äì2015: Chapters= In November 2014, Paradox unveiled a teaser video for a brand new single called Nothing Lasts. The song received its first radio airplay on 9 December on 'The Alternative with Dan Hegarty' on RT√â 2fm and was released internationally on 12 December. The full music video was released on New Year's Eve. Chapters was released on 24 January 2015.

The species is known only from the Middle Eocene Parachute Member, part of the Green River Formation, in the Piceance Creek Basin, Garfield County, northwestern Colorado, USA. History and classification Emiliana alexandri is known only from one fossil, the part and counterpart holotype, specimen number \\"PIN no. 4621/546\\". The specimen is composed of a single isolated tegmen which is preserved as a compression fossil in sedimentary rock. The fossil was recovered by David Kohls of Colorado Mountain College and A. P. Rasnitsyn of the Russian Academy of Sciences from outcrops of the Green River Formations Parachute Member exposed in the Anvil Points area of Garfield County, Colorado, USA. The type specimen is currently preserved in the paleoentomology collections housed in the Paleontological Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences, located in Moscow, Russia. Emiliana was first studied by Dmitry Shcherbakov of the Paleontological Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences with his 2006 type description of the tribe, genus and species being published in the Russian Entomological Journal. The generic name was coined by Shcherbakov in recognition of the world authority in planthoppers, A. F. Emeljanov, with the tribe name being a derivative of the genus name. The etymology of the specific epithet alexandri is in reference to Emeljanov's first name Alexandr. When Emiliana alexandri was described it displaced the genus Jantaritambia, which is known from Baltic Amber specimens, as the oldest member of Tropiduchidae to be described from the fossil record, being 10 million years older than Jantaritambia. The genus is noted to be similar to the modern tropiduchid genera Neommatissus, Paricana, Pseudoparicana, and Paricanoides. Description The E. alexandri type specimen is a well-preserved almost complete adult fore-wing, called a tegmen which is long. The tegmen is preserved with a mostly pale or possibly hyaline coloration with both the wing base and wing tip darkened. The forking of the Cu vein occurs much closer to the vein base then in other members of the family. Also the merging of the MP and CuA veins is distinct to the genus. Emiliana possess a crossvein, the cup- pcu is seen only in the extinct monotypic tribe Jantaritambiini.

He later became the senior vice president of the Dana Holding Corporation, a managing director of the family- owned TASEA Investment and Development Company, CEO of Controlled Environment Systems, Chairman and CEO of the National Tribune Corporation, publisher and editor-in-chief of the Stars and Stripes newspaper, president of the Stars and Stripes Foundation and president of the real estate holding firm Trout Run, LLC. Career =Military= Haugerud served for eight years on active duty during World War II and Korea as an aviation cadet, pilot and unit commander with tours of duty in the U.S., Europe and the Far East. At the height of the Cold War, he headed the air section of the Reconnaissance Squadron assigned 24/7 to patrol the borders of Soviet occupied East Germany and Czechoslovakia. =Government= After leaving the military, Haugerud joined the staff of the late Senator Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota. In that position, he played a key role in drafting and gaining support for the first Wilderness Bill that established 9.1 million acres of federally protected areas that became the forerunner of our 623 million acre National Wilderness Preservation System. After working with Senator Humphrey, Haugerud joined the committee staffs of Senator Henry M. (Scoop) Jackson of Washington state and Senator John L. McClellan of Arkansas, working on national security and governmental reorganization matters. Along with the late J.K. Mansfield and Dr. Dorothy Fosdick, he participated in a study recommending major changes in the National Security Council, which were adopted in 1961 by the newly elected John F. Kennedy. In 1958, Haugerud was the President of the United States Senate Staff Club. During this period, Haugerud also authored articles for national publications. His 1953 Harper's piece, The Unfortunate Taft Memorial, resulted in legislation being enacted to prohibit the building of future monuments to any senator or congressman on the Capitol grounds until they had been deceased a minimum of 50 years. In the more than half a century since that legislation became law, no legislator has been so honored. While both were serving on Senator McClellan's Government Operations Committee staffs, Haugerud and the late Robert Kennedy became friends. As a result, when Kennedy became head of his brother's presidential election campaign organization in 1960, he asked Haugerud to join the group. Knowing that he had a close personal friendship with Senator McClellan, the conservative senior senator and dominate political power in Arkansas, Kennedy asked Haugerud to set up headquarters in Little Rock and to aid the campaign in Texas, Kansas, Oklahoma and Missouri. During that period, Haugerud had the task of insuring mandatory access to the Arkansas voting apparatus, which was tightly controlled by the segregationist governor, Orville Fabus, and, at the same time, convince the governor not to endorse the Kennedy-Johnson ticket. Such an endorsement, right up to poll closing time in an election where the margin proved to be razor thin, could have cost Kennedy many hundreds of thousands of votes in large urban areas and thrown the victory to Nixon. Shortly after the inauguration, President Kennedy nominated Haugerud to the post of Assistant Secretary of the Army for Manpower and Reserve Affairs. Assured of easy senate conformation, the Minnesotan was preparing to assume the new job when officials discovered the post had been eliminated during the last days of the Eisenhower administration. A new position, that of Deputy Undersecretary of the Army for International Affairs was then created giving Haugerud responsibility for all army overseas interests, including the Administration of the Panama Canal Zone, the Panama Canal Company, Okinawa and the Ryukyu Islands. His domestic assignments also gave him responsibility to oversee the activities of U. S. Civil Defense and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. At that time, a special presidential order formulated by President Eisenhower was in force designating the Secretary of the Army as having exclusive authority over policies and operations concerning the Canal Zone and the Ryukyu Islands. In one of his first actions, Haugerud formed a committee to study the return of Okinawa and the surrounding Islands to Japan under conditions that would permit continued U.S. use of the military bases. He appointed Dr. Carl Kaysen, then deputy director of the National Security Council to head the group and asked that they proceed to Naha. Within six weeks, Dr. Kaysen's committee presented recommendations so comprehensive that they remained little changed during years of negotiations from 1961 until 1971 when the final treaty with Japan was signed. Shortly after taking office, Haugerud traveled to the Panama Canal Zone to inspect the Zone government and the Panama Canal Company. He found the company, charged with the operation of the legendary canal was being run efficiently, but under work rules differing little from those established when the project was completed in 1914. Under the guise of ‚Äúsecurity,‚Äù no Panamanian man or woman was permitted employment in positions other than as domestic help, or to reside within the ten mile wide strip of land that split the country from ocean to ocean. In the meantime, only American citizens were eligible for employment and they were being paid a 25% salary bonus based on the premise that the Zone was a hardship post. While assignment to the Zone was indeed a hardship in the early days of the Canal, by 1961 conditions had improved so as to be unrecognizable to former workers. Resentment among the native population was high and building, helped along by some thoughtless Americans who boasted they had lived and worked in the zone for 20 years and had never ventured over the line into largely destitute Panama. After reporting his findings to the Secretary of the Army and the President, Haugerud instituted programs to begin reducing the bonus payments, amend the security regulations and training Panamanians to fill substantive positions in the Canal Company work force. During his tenure with the Army, Haugerud worked closely with Attorney General Robert Kennedy in his fight against organized crime, and was able to place a number of persons in the witness protection program. One such occasion, at the request of Kennedy, he arranged for the legendary mobster Joe Valacchi to be secretly sequestered at a military prison in New Jersey for some 18 months to keep him from being assassinated by gang figures who feared being implicated by his testimony. This assignment, at times proved, very difficult as Haugerud was requested to refrain from sharing knowledge of the effort with any of his colleagues or superiors at the Dept. of Defense. A few weeks prior to his death, President Kennedy asked Haugerud to accept the position of Inspector General of Foreign Assistance at the Department of State as he was planning to name the incumbent to an ambassadorial post. After the president was assassinated, President Johnson decided not to move the sitting Inspector General, but supported congressional legislation elevating the position of Deputy Inspector General to that of the Inspector General, making the two leaders equal in rank. The congress quickly passed the provision and Haugerud was one of the earliest nominations sent to the Senate by the new president. At the time of his appointment, he was the youngest person to have attained the rank of Assistant Secretary of State. At that time, the Office of Inspectors General of Foreign Assistance was one of the most powerful federal government activities. The unit held statutory inspection and evaluation authority over all U.S. foreign assistance programs undertaken by the various federal bodies. These included economic aid by the State Department and the Agency for International Development, The Department of Agriculture's Public Law 480 and the Food For Peace efforts, The Peace Corp, The Department of Defense military assistance programs, as wells as any overseas initiatives by the Departments of the Treasury, Commerce and independent agencies. Unlike any other Inspector Generals, past or present, Haugerud, and his partner, Ken Mansfield, held program suspension authority, and could halt the expenditure of funds even though such a measure was contrary to the orders of the Secretary of State or any cabinet officer. They also had their own independent congressional budget appropriation so were not beholden for funding to the State Department or to any of the agencies they inspected. During the years 1963 to 1969, Haugerud traveled to a great many of the some 127 countries where the United States was sponsoring assistance programs. Vietnam, which was receiving huge shipments of commodities and arms, and where corruption was rampant, required much of his attention. One notable investigation revealed that one of the commodities being shipped by the U.S. to Vietnam appeared to be immensely popular. Hundreds of thousands of ‚Äúrubber‚Äù soled shoes were being imported into Saigon each month for resale to Vietnamese citizens. These shipments, along with vast quantities of hair spray and liquor were being quickly cleared through ports jammed with vessels, some waiting for as long as 50 days to unload their cargos of arms, ammunition, foodstuffs and other material required to support the massive war effort. A routine ‚Äúend use‚Äù survey by Haugerud's inspectors turned up evidence that shipments of shoe manufacturing material was sufficiently large so as to enable every inhabitant of Vietnam to own several unique pair, yet they could not be found in the most likely places‚Äîon the feet of Vietnamese men, women or children. Unable to solve the mystery in Saigon, Haugerud ordered that a number of the shoes and samples of the chemical Unicel-100 used in their manufacture, be sent to a government laboratory where it was quickly determined the ‚Äúrubber‚Äù shoes when melted down produced a highly explosive substance. The Unicel proved have the power close to that of TNT. The shipments were very quickly, and very quietly halted. During this period, Haugerud's work was repeatedly praised on the floor of the House of Representatives and the United States Senate, with members of both bodies entering their remarks in the Congressional Record. In a 1966 New York Times op-ed article, legendary investigative reporter Felix Belair wrote that Mr. Haugerud ‚Äúknows the ins and out of commercial skullduggery like the back of his hand.‚Äù When President Nixon took office in 1969, he asked Haugerud to remain in his administration. In September 1969, due to his wife's cancer and the travel required for his position, Haugerud resigned. He then became the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Executive Seminar, the U.S. government's most senior training institution. The Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Executive Seminar was the U.S. government's most senior training institution, staffed and funded by the Department of State, the Department of Defense, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of Treasury, the Department of Agriculture, the Agency for International Development and the Department of Commerce. Its students were senior officers from those organizations who were preparing to assume overseas posts as well as those returning from such assignments on their way to domestic positions in their respective branches. Mr. Haugerud had a wide latitude to prescribe the curriculum, select the faculty members and to recruit outside lecturers from government, industry and academe. Many of the students became ambassadors; Chiefs of Military Missions; Commerce, Agriculture and Treasury Attaches, AID Mission Directors; and CIA Station Chiefs, which enabled Haugerud and his staff to convince hundreds of high level speakers from all walks of life to teach at the institution. Haugerud once said that during the 6 years he headed the organization, he could not recall a single instance where an invitation to lecture was not accepted. =Public sector positions= Haugerud resigned from government service at the age of 50 in 1974 in order to assume the position of vice president of government affairs for the Dana Holding Corporation of Toledo, Ohio. Later, he was appointed the chairman and CEO of Controlled Environment Systems, a high tech energy and lighting company located in Rockville, Maryland. He also became a managing director of the TASEA Investment and Real Estate Development Corporation of Washington, D.C. In 1993, Haugerud purchased controlling interest in the National Tribune Corporation of Washington D.C., which had published military and veterans newspapers since shortly after the Civil War. The corporation was on the verge of bankruptcy and had been cited by the U.S. Postal Service for failure to report accurate advertiser circulation figures for the Stars and Stripes newspaper. Haugerud became the Stars and Stripes publisher and editor-in-chief and served in these positions until he sold the publication to Iserved in 2000. During his career, Haugerud also served as the Vice President of the Army Aviation Association and President of the McClellan Memorial Foundation.

Early life In 1928, Dumar Aljure was born in Girardot, Cundinamarca, in Colombia. His father was a shopkeeper from Lebanon. He did not receive very much education, and spent some of his youth as a laborer in Bogot√°. From an early age he was in conflict with the law, being jailed for theft in 1945 before joining the National Army of Colombia in 1950. This was the time of La Violencia, a conflict between the Colombian Liberal Party and the Colombian Conservative Party. Aljure's sympathies lay with the Liberal Party, and he soon deserted the army, which was affiliated with the Conservatives, in order to join the guerrilla forces fighting for the Liberals. He first joined a group called the Bautista brothers, but due to disagreements with the group leadership he switched to another group, the Fonseca brothers, before finally joining a group led by Guadalupe Salcedo. Salcedo gave Aljure command of his group's operations in the San Mart√≠n Territory near the Arriari River, a rural region of Meta Department, and Aljure took over operations in this region sometime in early or late 1953. Following a coup by General of the Army Gustavo Rojas Pinilla in June 1953, much of the violence in Colombia ceased, and Rojas tried to use his army to build stability. In 1954 and 1955, Aljure had carried out guerrilla activities outside the Arriari region, but in 1955, pursued by Rojas' Army, he returned to San Mart√≠n. Political activities Rojas, content for Aljure and some other guerrillas to stay in isolated Arriari region, eventually left Aljure alone. Around this time, Aljure set himself up as the political head of the region, creating a shadow government quite independent from the central government, and began to rule over it. In effect, he became the dictator of his own autonomous republic, and he won the allegiance of the populace by using his guerrilla band, by now a small army, to protect them from abuse by the National Police and army. In 1957, continuing to build up his position as head of the region, he moved to the town of Rinc√≥n de Bol√≠var and began a cattle business. During this period, he was also involved in smuggling industrial and luxury goods, and also forced the farmers of his region to pay him taxes. His considerable economic and political stature eventually allowed him to gain influence over the regular political process as well, and he began to control the election of various municipal and police functionaries. Through these contacts, Aljure was able to obtain information on the activities of the National Police and army, in order to avoid being apprehended by them. In addition, Aljure was able to influence the disposition of votes in Meta Department, much of which he now controlled, and he used this power to curry favor with the national political elite of the Liberal Party. Death After the congressional elections of 1968, Aljure's situation began to change. In that election, a selection of candidates supported by Senator Hernando Dur√°n Duss√°n was defeated, and Duss√°n, in response, publicly indicated that he might cause a Conservative governor to be appointed as governor of Meta Department, which jeopardized Aljure's supremacy in the region. In addition, in early 1968 Aljure murdered a bartender while in the presence of an army sergeant, which indicated his contempt for the authority of the military and may have provoked the army to move against him. The army spent several months in the beginning of 1968 searching for him, and on April 5, 1968, the army and police attacked Aljure's house at Rinc√≥n de Bol√≠var. A lengthy firefight ensued, which left dead Aljure, Aljure's wife, and thirteen guerillas. His cadaver was made available for public display, and was viewed by more than 1,000 people.

Chumpon Attasat Superintendent of the Riot Control and Suppression Sub-Division had established a special operation unit called \\"Anti-Hijacker\\". He has selected police officers within the unit who were physically, mentally, and intellectually ready to the specified qualifications to attend the training in order to cater to missions of the international nature. During the training, there was no financial support not even for the meals of the attendees. Therefore, participants joined in this training with their hearts and ideologies. After Pol.Col.Chumpon Attasit was assigned to take a position in a different unit the special operation had changed. In 1983 There was an international terrorism incident and insurgency in Thailand, particularly in Bangkok. Pol.Maj.General Thip Asawarak Commander of Patrol and Special Operations Division at that time had resurrected the special operation unit. He requested the Royal Thai Police department for the authorization of an international training plan for the special operation unit similar to GSG9 in Germany. Later in 1984, The Royal Thai Police department ordered the establishment of a special operation unit within the Metropolitan Police Bureau, using the name of special operation unit \\"Arintaraj 26\\"  Operations  The company has been involved in a number of high-profile criminal cases, including: 1\\\\.

The World War II Letters of an American Veteran of the Spanish Civil War is a World War II biography book by Lawrence Cane. During World War II, Lawrence Cane wrote more than 300 letters home to his wife while serving in the American Army. In 1995, his son David E. Cane discovered them in a box that had remained in the attic for almost 50 years. Having fought earlier as a member of the International Brigades in the Spanish Civil War on the side of the Spanish Republic against the Nationalist forces of General Francisco Franco, Lawrence Cane enlisted in the U. S. Army as a committed anti-fascist and with extensive combat experience. Serving first as a white officer of the all black 582nd Engineer Dump Truck Company in the then segregated American Army, Lawrence Cane eventually landed in Normandy in the first assault waves on D-Day, June 6, 1944. Shortly thereafter he was transferred to the 238th Engineer Combat Battalion with which he served at the front for the remainder of the war in Northern Europe. He ultimately won the Silver Star for gallantry in action as well as the French Croix de Guerre. His letters home were filled with his politically sophisticated observations and eyewitness accounts of some of the most dramatic events in history: segregated military units in an Army that was fighting against racism and oppression, the D-Day landings in Normandy, the liberation of France and Belgium, the Battle of the Bulge, the encounter with the Germans, the early stages of the occupation of Germany, and the horrors of the discovery of the concentration camps. His writings establish the clear link between the Spanish Civil War and World War II. The letters are also filled with his love for his wife, his loneliness at their separation, and his hopes and dreams for their future. David E. Cane collaborated with two accomplished historians, Prof. Judy Barrett Litoff of Bryant University and Prof. David C. Smith of the University of Maine, to provide detailed annotations and historical background to the letters.

This emotion eventually leads him to sing the Academy Award-winning song, \\"Man or Muppet\\", where the human version of Walter is portrayed by actor Jim Parsons. The scene is pivotal to the character's arc as it resolves Walter's internal issues with himself. The character's solo act of whistling in the telethon's finale was performed by musician Andrew Bird. At the conclusion of the film, Walter deduces that he is a Muppet, adopts whistling as his sole talent and joins the group as their newest member. A 2010 article from Entertainment Weekly described Walter by writing; > Meet the newest member of the Muppet repertory company: Walter, a sweet, > slightly naive twenty-something every-puppet who, in the movie, is the best > friend and roommate of Jason Segel's character, Gary. Both Gary and Walter > are die-hard Muppet fans. \\"Walter is the kind of guy who faints when he sees > Kermit,\\" [James] Bobin says. Of course, Walter's Muppet fandom is > complicated by the fact that he is a Muppet himself. \\"Walter has a bit of a > self-confidence issue because he's the only person like him that he's seen > aside from the Muppets,\\" Segel explains. \\"His dream is to meet the Muppets > and be around people who are like him.\\" When Gary and Walter learn that the > Muppet Theater is in danger of being torn down, they set out to save it by > reuniting Kermit, Piggy and the entire troupe to stage an old-fashioned > extravaganza.Entertainment Weekly-Rottenberg, Josh. Entertainment Weekly. > First Look: Exclusive Sneak Peek at the New Muppet Movie. November 12, 2010. > ‚ÄîEntertainment Weekly Development =Characterization= In the process of conceptualizing Walter, Nicholas Stoller said; \\"We wanted a simple character, who was pure innocence and pure enthusiasm as an entry point for kids who aren't necessarily as familiar with The Muppets as their parents.\\" Jason Segel, added: \\"He's a stand-in for me, a hardcore Muppet fan who wants to know what the hell happened to them.\\" He also revealed a shared ambition with the character; \\"He sets out to make them as famous as they once were ‚Äî which was sort of our goal in making this movie.\\" Stoller and Segel's screenplay had described Walter as the adopted younger brother of Gary and had set Walter's age to be approximately 30 years old. Much to the producers' surprise, Disney granted them the creative license to conceive a new Muppet without any initial marketing research, a technique Disney often employs when creating characters for their consumer products franchisees. Segel and Stoller, however, were only responsible for creating Walter's personality and character traits‚Äîhis physical appearance was crafted by the Muppets Studio and Puppet Heap. Peter Linz came to the producers' attention after a screenplay read-through, where he assisted fellow Muppet performer Eric Jacobson. The producers called Linz, asking if he were interested in auditioning for the role. Linz, however, did not initially win over the film's producers, and he was asked to audition again. During his second audition, Linz was told to emulate actor Michael Cera in his demeanor, because the producers wanted Walter to be quiet and shy, similar to the way Cera acts. Linz received the role after completing his second audition, where he improvised dialogue with Segel and performed several music duets, including \\"Love Will Keep Us Together\\". As Walter's characterization became more defined, Linz identified a comparative bond between him and Walter; \\"The character of Walter hits really close to home for me. I‚Äôve always been an enormous Muppet fan who dreamed of one day working with the Muppets, and that‚Äôs basically who Walter is.\\" Producer Todd Lieberman remarked, \\"The emotional core of the movie is Walter. The idea is that he's not comfortable where he is now but he ends up finding a place where he's comfortable at. That's a really great lesson.\\" =Design= In the screenplay for The Muppets, Stoller and Segel described Walter as having the feel of \\"an old dishrag\\" that wore a blue suit. The writers stated that they wanted Walter to be small, because even though he was an adult, he needed to feel like he was \\"out of place in the human world.\\" Walter's actual height has been recorded as being 18 inches tall. Paul Andrejco, president of Puppet Heap, showed the producers 14 different iterations of the basic puppet, each of them different in size and shape. Andrejco and the producers had to choose from 25 different possibilities for color and texture, ranging from \\"pink and scruffy to orange-y speckly to flat gray\\". Lieberman spoke about how Walter couldn't be a joke, and said, \\"At the end of the movie, you want to shed a tear for him when he finds his place.\\" Appearances Walter also appeared with the rest of the Muppets on several promotional posters and images. He also appeared several times to promote the film, including appearing on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, along with Jason Segel. Walter appeared as part of the Muppets ensemble in Cee Lo Green's \\"All I Need Is Love\\" in 2012. He also appeared in Kirk Scroggs‚Äô ‚ÄúTales Of A Sixth-Grade Muppet‚Äù book series. =Filmography= *The Muppets (2011) *Lady Gaga and the Muppets Holiday Spectacular (2013) (TV) *Muppets Most Wanted (2014) *Disney Drive-On with The Muppets (2014) (Web) *The Muppets (2015) (TV) (Presentation Pilot Only) *The Muppets Take the Bowl (2017) *The Muppets Take the O2 (2018) * Muppets Now (2020) References External links * at Disney.com * Walter on IMDb Category:Film characters introduced in 2011 Category:The Muppets characters Category:Whistlers ","title":"Walter (Muppet)"},{"id":"33168815","text":"Stig Lennart Andersson (born 30 March 1957) usually referred to as Stig L.

It is a team title featuring Etrigan, Madame Xanadu, Shining Knight and others. Its main difference to other team titles, such as the Justice League, is that this team is based in the Medieval period of the DC Universe history. Its initial writer is Paul Cornell, with art by Diogenes Neves. Publication history In the planning stages of The New 52, Paul Cornell was asked to write an Etrigan title. At his request this became a team title set in Medieval times as this was of more interest to him, and a more fitting period for Etrigan to operate. Cornell also stated that a love of the film The Magnificent Seven is an influence on the title, and that it is a team title as he is more interested in the interactions between characters, rather than any scene or period. It has been confirmed that this team is the ancestral version of Stormwatch.Stormwatch (vol. 3) #0 (Sept. 2012)Demon Knights #15 (Dec. 2012) Characters *Etrigan - A demon, bonded to a human magician, Jason Blood. Originally created by Jack Kirby. *Lucifer - A Fallen Angel and the ruler of Hell. *Madame Xanadu - A powerful magician, with ties to Merlin. *Vandal Savage - An immortal man, and regular villain in the DC Universe. *Shining Knight - A woman-knight called Sir Ystin, from fallen Camelot *The Horsewoman - A mysterious woman never seen off her horse. *Al Jabr - A Middle Eastern fighter and tactician, with a good knowledge of mathematics. *Exoristos - A strange woman with ties to the Amazons. Plot The first arc opens with Jason Blood and Madame Xanadu arriving at the town of Little Spring. While in the local tavern, they find themselves among the likes of Vandal Savage, Sir Ystin, Al Jabr, and Exoristos. Outside the town, the impending horde of The Questing Queen and Mordru composed of barbarians, magically enchanted dinosaurs, and mechanical man-powered dragons is heading towards the town.Demon Knights #1 (Sept. 2011) The Queen wishes to go through Little Spring to reach the rich city of Alba Sarum and take it by surprise. When the horde meets resistance from the heroes, the Queen decides the only choice of action is to contain and destroy the town. Vandal tells the villagers that the only means of survival is to evacuate, having once served in the Questing Queen's horde. However to save the town from an oncoming fireball, Xanadu creates a magical barrier sealing Little Spring inside and out until sunrise.Demon Knights #2 (Oct. 2011) The Horsewoman is able to get through the barrier and heads to warn Alba Sarum and bring reinforcements. As the heroes and villagers prepare for the battle to come, Sir Ystin receives a vision from Merlin. He reveals to Ystin the source of his immortality and his yearning to seek the holy grail. Merlin also explains that Camelot itself is a city which is reincarnated over the centuries, meaning to be the best of humanity but always falling before its time.Demon Knights #4 (Dec. 2011) Vandal defects to the Queen, escaping Little Spring by an underground passage, and is made general for her forces. Finally day breaks, and Xanadu's barrier falls.Demon Knights #5 (Jan. 2012) The result is a brutal slaughter of the villagers of Little Spring. Vandal reveals his real intentions were to capture the horde's supply lines for himself but is discovered by the Queen. She open fires on her own forces which causes routing and chaos. The forces of Alba Sarum arrive and force the Questing Queen to retreat but Little Spring and its people are devastated.Demon Knights #7 (Mar. 2012) After the battle, the group is summoned by the Princesses Alba and Sarum. They have built their city in the hopes of creating a new Camelot and even had Merlin aiding them. Yet Merlin himself was mysteriously murdered and without his help, the princesses are unable to fulfill their promise of creating a new Camelot and will be unable to marry. Xanadu explains that the only means of resurrecting Merlin is to retrieve his soul from Avalon. The princesses give them a ship and weapons to travel to Britain and find a way into Avalon. Meanwhile, Etrigan plans with his master, Lucifer, to take Avalon for themselves.Demon Knights #9 (May. 2012) After a battle with pirates while crossing the English Channel, the heroes arrive in Britain which has been recently plagued by giant ravenous animals. They track the source of the monsters to the abandoned ruins of Camelot. The only remaining structure is now an eerie tower which beams sickly green light. The heroes are then attacked by an undead incarnation of King Arthur as the light turns all of the Demon Knights into monsters which resemble their darkest desires save for Madame Xanadu.Demon Knights #10 (Jun. 2012) The undead King Arthur leads them to a cave where he uses the waters of Camelot to revert their transformations. With the help of the Demon Knights, Arthur leads an assault on the tower. As they enter, it is revealed that the source of the dark magic about the ruins is the work of Morgaine le Fey.Demon Knights #11 (Jul. 2012) Morgaine captures King Arthur and the Demon Knights and explains that she plans to use them as sacrifices to leave her own decrepit form and possess Merlin's. After escaping, the heroes confront Morgaine but she uses her magic to possess Arthur instead. With his last ounce of strength, Arthur destroys the magical center of the tower and brings it crumbling down. While Morgaine is stopped, the knights are unable to find passage into Avalon and an enraged Etrigan sends them all to Hell.Demon Knights #12 (Aug. 2012) In hell, the Demon Knights are faced with their own individual torments as Lucifer and Etrigan plan their next move. Exoristos's torment is to be chained to the shores of Themyscira, unable to reach it. Lucifer appears before her and offers her release if she carries a black diamond back to Earth. This leaves Jason Blood behind in the ruins of Camelot and prepares to enter Hell to save Xanadu until he is interrupted by the Questing Queen.Demon Knights #13 (Sep. 2012) The Queen makes a deal with Jason to force the swap between him and Etrigan so that he may rescue Xanadu. Meanwhile, Sir Ystin breaks free from his torment and begins rescuing the other Demon Knights and they make plans to escape to Avalon with Merlin's body. Meanwhile, both the Questing Queen and Lucifer make plans to invade Avalon and take it for themselves. It's during this that Sir Ystin explains to Exoristos, after she tries to make a pass at him, that he is \\"not just a man or a woman. [He is] both.\\" The heroes finally make their way to Avalon but are attacked by Avalon's forces as well as those of Lucifer and the Questing Queen.Demon Knights #14 (Oct. 2012) A massive battle between the forces of Earth, Heaven, and Hell erupts as King Arthur appears with his knights from across the ages. Merlin is slowly rejuvenated by the magic of Avalon and tells them to create rain which Al Jabr provides. The rain of Avalon weakens Lucifer's demons and cleanses the enchantments on the Queen's dinosaurs. With both forces defeated, the Demon Knights are victorious and Merlin dubs them the first incarnation of Stormwatch. On their return to Earth, the Demon Knights go their separate ways.Demon Knights #15 (Nov. 2012) Thirty years later, the Demon Knights are brought together again by an aged Al Jabr (being the only non-immortal). He says that the vampire Cain is making his way across Europe with a horde of vampires and plans to turn the warriors of Themyscira into his own unstoppable undead army.Demon Knights #16 (Dec. 2012) The Demon Knights finally reunite but are too late as Cain's forces set sail towards Themyscira.Demon Knights #18 (Feb. 2013) Using Xanadu's magic, the knights create a makeshift raft and help the Amazons in repelling Cain. However, Sir Ystin believes this battle will mark him being turned into a vampire as told to him by his vision. Though they manage to defeat Cain, Ystin is bitten.Demon Knights #19 (Mar. 2013) Reception The first issue was the 72nd best selling comic by units in September, 2011. The series opened to positive reviews, with scores around 8 or 9 from IGN's comics section for the first few issues, with writer Erik Norris' entreating readers to read this title, saying, \\"People, Demon Knights is awesome. Please join the bandwagon and give this fun book a shot if you haven't already. You won't regret it. A series like this needs all the support it can get to keep it from getting the axe\\". Popmatters compared Paul Cornell's retro-modern style to a DJ, mixing the RZA and Miles Davis.

These scenes of mothers with their nannies or a group of women comparing engagement rings establish both a critique of this kind of lifestyle as well as what the artist calls her own \\"complicated desire\\" to be part of this world. =\\"Hopper Redux\\" series = Albert- Halaban's series \\"Hopper Redux\\" revisits the exact locations in Gloucester, Massachusetts where Edward Hopper painted. The photographs elicit an uncanny familiarity. They echo Hopper's paintings, but they are decidedly photographic and of the present day. In this sense they seem to oscillate between the historical past and the contemporary present. =Out My Window series = Albert-Halaban's ongoing series Out My Window consists of elaborately staged photographs of people in their homes, shot from a distance. The architecture of New York City apartment buildings features prominently in the pictures, but the focus is the intimate view of their inhabitants. =Out My Window, Paris series = Albert-Halaban's series \\"Out My Window, Paris\\" picks up where its namesake leaves off. Set in Paris, Albert-Halaban peers through and photographs what‚Äôs behind the windows in the French city‚Äôs apartments and courtyards. As with \\"Out My Window\\" the residents are knowingly photographed, as if actors on the film set. A set of the Paris photographs first appeared in the French publication Le Monde in November, 2012. =Out My Window, Global = Albert-Halaban has published a book called Italian Views with the Aperture Foundation, in which she has photographed from window to neighboring window in cities throughout that nation and collected stories of what neighbors imagine when they look to their neighbor's windows. She has photographed in countries around the globe including South Korea, Turkey, Portugal, Canada, Argentina, France, and Israel both by traveling to those countries and by using remote technology to photograph from her studio in New York City. =Distinctions= Albert-Halaban's work has appeared in the New York Times, New York magazine, Time magazine, M, World Magazine, Slate (magazine), and The Huffington Post. Her fine art photography has been internationally exhibited. Albert-Halaban was a New York Foundation for the Arts Fellow in 2019. =Collections= Albert-Halaban's work is in public and private collections including the Hermes Foundation, George Eastman Museum, Yale University Art Gallery, Nelson Atkins Museum, Getty Museum, Cape Ann Museum, Wichita Art Museum hold her work. She teaches in the Medical Humanities Department at Columbia University. =Teaching= Albert-Halaban teaches in the Narrative Medicine Department at Columbia University where she supports and teaches art-making on the medical campus by both students and faculty. Her program teaches observation and empathy. Research shows that education in the humanities improves doctors' performance. =Cross-discipline work= Inspired by her \\"Out my Window\\" photograph series, Sheila Callaghan and Marcus Gardley composed a one-act play Grace & Milt, dramatizing what might happen when neighbors who have never met connect through their windows. Its debut performance, starring Adam O'Byrne and Zoe Winters, took place in April 2019 at Aperture Gallery in New York City.

The convention entered into force in 2006, after thirtieth instruments of ratification by UNESCO Member States.Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage Romania was the 30th state, ratifying the agreement on 20 January 2006. As of September 2018, 178 states have ratified, approved or accepted the convention.States Parties to the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage. Content =Layout of the Convention= The Convention contains following provisions: =Purposes of the Convention= Unlike other UNESCO conventions, this convention begins with stating its purposes, which are; =Definition= Intangible cultural heritage refers to \\"traditions or living expressions inherited from our ancestors and passed on to our descendants, such as oral traditions, performing arts, social practices, rituals, festive events, knowledge and practices concerning nature and the universe or the knowledge and skills to produce traditional crafts\\".What is Intangible Cultural Heritage p.3 The Convention defines it as follows: =Function= The Convention works on both national and international levels. At the national level, State Parties are supposed to ‚Äòtake necessary measures to ensure the safeguarding of the intangible cultural heritage present in its territory.‚Äù These measures include identification of the intangible cultural heritage that exists in its territory, adoption of appropriate policies, promotion of education and so on.Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage Article 11 Besides, in taking these measures, each state parties must ‚Äúendeavor to ensure the widest possible participation of communities, groups, and, where appropriate, individuals that create, maintain and transmit such heritage, and to involve them actively in its management‚Äù.Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage Article 15 At the international level, this Convention promotes international cooperation, which includes ‚Äúthe exchange of information and experience, joint initiatives, and the establishment of a mechanism of assistance‚Äù to other State Parties.Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage Article 19 Lists The Committee to the Convention publishes and keeps up to date two lists of intangible cultural heritage, which are *the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity *the List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding.Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage Article 16,17 Intangible Cultural Heritage Fund The Convention establishes Intangible Cultural Heritage Fund, the use of which is decided by the Committee. The fund mainly consists of the contributions by State Parties and funds by the General Conference of UNESCO.Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage Article 25 History =Precursors= One of the first international occasions that mentioned the preservation of 'intangible heritage' was the World Conference on Cultural Policies in Mexico City in 1982.Working towards the 2003 Convention p.6 This Conference defined cultural heritage as including ‚Äúboth tangible and intangible works through which the creativity of people finds expression,‚Äù and asked UNESCO and Member States to take measures for protecting this kind of heritage. In 1989, UNESCO adopted the Recommendation on the Safeguarding of Traditional Culture and Folklore as the first legal instrument towards the safeguarding of intangible cultural heritage.Working towards the 2003 Convention p.7 This Recommendation reflected the ideas of the earlier Conference in Mexico City. UNESCO conducted some promotional programs for raising awareness of this Recommendation, but was not very successful. However, in the late 1990s, there was a conference held for the assessment of this Recommendation, which pointed out some problems to be considered in drafting the Convention. In this sense, this Recommendation served as an important step.Working towards the 2003 Convention p.10 In 1997, UNESCO launched the program of Proclamation of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity, intending to raise awareness of the importance of intangible heritage. This program proclaimed a total of 90 masterpieces between 2001 and 2005, and caused the movement toward the Convention.Proclamation of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity (2001‚Äì2005) =Creation= According to the request of Member States, a preliminary study, undertaken by Director-General, on how could the safeguarding of intangible cultural heritage be conducted, recommended to create a new document that set an international standard. In 2001, the General Conference adopted another instrument, Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity, which also includes articles dealing with the preservation of ‚Äôheritage in all forms‚Äô.UNESCO Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity Article 7 This declaration and its Action Plan presented basic idea of the coming convention and helped to develop it.Working towards the 2003 Convention As a result of many meetings for two years, the draft Convention was brought into the General Conference and adopted in 2003. Criticism = Intangible heritage = The definition of intangible cultural heritage has been criticized as potentially incomplete and/or creating a \\"Pandora's box of difficulties\\". For example, in a 2004 article in Museum International, Richard Kurin says that because the Convention does not recognize cultural activities not compatible with international human rights instruments, some activities, such as female genital mutilation, that groups may themselves consider critical to their culture, are not eligible. Similarly, Kurin notes that since many group's culture is defined in opposition to other cultures, the requirement for \\"mutual respect\\" may leave out traditional songs and stories that glorify \\"empire, victorious kings, religious conversion, or alternatively resistance to perceived injustice, martyrdom and defeat\\". However, Kurin also notes that the definition can be more expansive than intended by its designers, who originally planned only to protect \\"traditional cultural activities\\". He says that it is robust enough to encompass more modern forms of culture, including things like \\"rap music, Australian cricket, modern dance, post-modernist architectural knowledge, and karaoke bars\\". Richard Kurin has argued that dividing culture into individual units is inconsistent with modern academic views of cultures. Additionally, Michael Brown has argued that Convention's focus on cataloging is based on an outdated belief that listing the details of a culture has some connection to preservation of that culture. States are also encouraged to enact programs to safeguard intangible cultural heritages, though any such work must be done in cooperation with the local practitioners. This aspect has also been criticized, since it is unclear how a state can safeguard a cultural practice by force, particularly if there is insufficient interest from local practitioners.

Two smaller versions, sketches or replicas, are held by the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery and the Yale Center for British Art. The Tate painting measures by ,Tate Gallery, page on the painting, more and was completed in 1856. The painting The subject of the painting was the 17-year-old English early Romantic poet Thomas Chatterton, shown dead after he poisoned himself with arsenic in 1770. Chatterton was considered a Romantic hero for many young and struggling artists in Wallis's day. Wallis's method and style in Chatterton reveal the importance of his connection to the Pre- Raphaelite movement, seen in the vibrant colours and careful build-up of symbolic detail. He used a bold colour scheme with a contrasting palette and he exploited the fall of the natural light through the window of the garret to implement his much loved style at the time, chiaroscuro. Wallis painted the work in a friend's chamber in Gray's Inn, with St Paul's Cathedral on the skyline visible through the window. It was probably a coincidence that this location was close to the garret in Brooke Street where Chatterton died 86 years before. The model used for the painting was the young George Meredith, a Victorian era English novelist and poet.The Solicitors' journal and reporter, Volume 4 The painting was Wallis's first exhibited work. It was shown at the Royal Academy summer exhibition in 1856, with a quotation from the Tragedy of Doctor Faustus by Christopher Marlowe inscribed on the frame: \\"Cut is the branch that might have grown full straight, And burned is Apollo's laurel bough\\". It was an immediate success, with John Ruskin describing it as \\"faultless and wonderful\\". It drew large crowds at the Art Treasures Exhibition in Manchester in 1857, was also exhibited in Dublin in 1859,Rebels And Martyrs: The Image of the Artist in the Nineteenth Century, Alexander Sturgis, p. 52 and was one of the most popular Victorian paintings in reproductive print form. Wallis sold the painting to Augustus Egg in 1856, and Egg sold the right to make engraved reproductions. The painting became the subject of a court case after Dublin photographer James Robinson was inspired to recreate the painting as a tableau vivant so he could sell photographs of the scene.The Photographic Experience, 1839‚Äì1914: Images and Attitudes, Heinz K. Henisch, Bridget Ann Henisch, pp. 306‚Äì7 The painting was left to the Tate Gallery by Charles Gent Clement in 1899. There are two smaller versions of the same subject by Wallis, one either a study or a replica in the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, which measures by and, somewhat unusually for the period,Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery page a small oil-on-panel replica at the Yale Center for British Art, which measures by .Yale page The Birmingham work was sold at Christie's in 1875 to Baron Albert Grant and then in 1877 to William Kendrick, who donated it to the gallery in 1918.

It was built in 1939 by Charles G. Wallace, a local trader of Zuni art and pottery, who remained the owner until 1983. Wallace decorated the motel with a variety of Native American art, including a series of murals by Zuni artist Tony Edaakie in a basement room. The motel was purchased by the city of Albuquerque in 2003 and remained vacant while various renovation proposals fell through. Ultimately, the city approved a plan to redevelop the site with mostly new construction, and all but two smaller buildings were demolished in 2017‚Äì18. The De Anza will be replaced by a new hotel and apartment complex echoing the original and preserving some of the historic elements including the sign and the Zuni murals. History Charles Garrett Wallace came to New Mexico in 1919 to work for the Ilfeld Company, where he became a prominent trader with the people of Zuni Pueblo. In the 1930s, with trade suffering due to the Depression, Wallace saw the influx of tourists on Route 66 as an opportunity to expand his business. He partnered with Tucson entrepreneur S.D. Hambaugh to build a motel on East Central, which they named the De Anza Motor Lodge after Juan Bautista de Anza, a Spanish governor of New Mexico. The motel opened in 1939 with 30 rooms. Soon thereafter, Wallace bought out Hambaugh to become the sole owner. Wallace expanded and remodeled the De Anza after World War II, removing most of the Pueblo Revival elements to give the motel a more modern appearance. The number of rooms increased to 55 and then 67. A cafe called the Turquoise Room, featuring a terrazzo floor inlaid with turquoise and silver pieces, and a basement conference room were also added. To decorate the conference room, Wallace commissioned Zuni artist Tony Edaakie to create two large murals depicting the Shalako festival. Completed in 1951, the murals are considered to be a unique example of such artwork. Wallace sold the De Anza in 1983 and died ten years later. The motel changed hands several times and eventually went out of business. In 2002, a proposal by Albertsons to raze the De Anza caught the attention of the city, which began looking at ways to save the property and ultimately bought it for $891,000 in July 2003. However, two different renovation projects fell apart over the next ten years as the motel continued to deteriorate. In 2017, the city approved a redevelopment project which would turn the property into a hotel and apartment complex of substantially new construction, preserving only a few pieces of the historic motel. The project proceeded in 2017‚Äì18 with most of the De Anza being razed. Two smaller buildings were preserved, along with the motel sign and the Zuni murals. The building was added to the New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties in 2003 and the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. In 2012, it was designated a Historic Landmark by the city of Albuquerque. Architecture The De Anza site occupies a full city block at the northwest corner of Central Avenue and Washington Street. Prior to the 2017‚Äì18 demolitions, the motel consisted of six one-story lodging buildings arranged in a U shape around a courtyard with a pair of two-story buildings set one in front of the other at the center. The front-most building, containing the office and manager's residence, had a projecting porte-coch√®re and adjacent swimming pool. The rear building contained additional lodging units. The Turquoise Room coffee shop was situated at the southwest corner of the complex. The office, front part of the central lodging building, and the two peripheral buildings on either side dated to the 1930s and were of frame construction, while the other buildings were concrete block and were added in the 1950s. The older buildings were remodeled at the same time, removing many of the original Pueblo Revival details to give a regional vernacular appearance.

An employee of Omega Visi√≥n, he died 11 May 2011 from gunshot wounds inflicted by assailants the previous evening. Personal H√©ctor Francisco Medina Polanco is survived by his brother and his mother. Career In his TV program, he often criticized irregularities in the Moraz√°n municipal government and referred to land disputes involving the region‚Äôs cattle farmers. Medina received threats as a result of the views he had expressed on agricultural issues. According to his brother, Carlos Medina Polanco, H√©ctor had received death threats on several occasions over the past six months as a result of his work in publicizing human rights issues. He spoke out on agricultural issues and was a strong critic of police actions. He also criticized private security groups who guard the property of wealthy estates owners in the areas where drug gangs notoriously operate. He often spoke out against irregularities in Moraz√°n's municipal government and raised social, political and education issues on his news program. He also worked on a governmental education project called Programa Hondure√±o de Educaci√≥n Comunitaria (Honduran Program for Community Education). Death Medina was shot on his motorcycle by two other men on another motorcycle. He was struck twice in the chest and once in the arm. His killers followed him to his home in Moraz√°n, a town outside the city of El Progreso. He died the next day from related complications at a municipal hospital in San Pedro Sula. Front Line believes that the killing of H√©ctor Francisco Medina Polanco is directly related to his work in the defense of human rights, particularly his reporting of agricultural and corruption issues in Honduras. Context H√©ctor's brother, journalist Carlos Alberto Medina Polanco, has reported to C-Libre that he has been receiving death threats via messages on his mobile phone. In the messages he has been told that he will \\"meet the same fate\\" if he continues to demand an investigation into his brother's death. He also noted that he has been followed by individuals on a motorcycle when he leaves the San Pedro Sula radio station where he works. As a result, he has taken a temporary leave of absence from his position at the station. In addition, he reported that, on 10 June 2011, his 16-year-old daughter was kidnapped, assaulted and questioned about his activities for three hours. \\"The trauma caused by the coup continues to affect Honduran society and the current demonstrations are an expression of this,\\" AMARC-ALC and Reporters Without Borders said. \\"The repression has been stepped up again in the wake of the testimony about the situation that representatives of grass-roots movements, civil society organizations and NGOs gave to the Inter- American Commission on Human Rights, now in session.\\" Impact Medina was the 11th journalist killed in Honduras; none have been investigated. \\"It will be hard to celebrate National Day of the Journalist on 25 May if the persecution of community radio stations and news media opposed to the June 2009 coup d‚Äô√©tat continues at the same frenetic pace, especially in the San Pedro Sula region, where there have been several cases in recent days,\\" Reporters Without Borders said. The World Association of Community Radio Broadcasters for Latin America and Caribbean (AMARC-ALC) and Reporters Without Borders have appealed for an end to the hostility toward community and opposition media (or what is regarded as opposition media) amid the continuing social unrest in Honduras: > It is clear from what has been happening that the government has not kept > the promises it made to the United Nations Human Rights Council. As regards > the areas covered by our mandates, we believe that there will be no peace in > Honduras as long as: *The impunity continues, not only for the murders of > journalists and human rights activists, but also for the attacks and acts of > sabotage against the media, whose perpetrators are known. *The authorities > continue to enforce obsolete radio-broadcast and telecommunications laws > that allow no place for community media, although legislation for this media > is required by Inter-American legal standards. *The authorities continue to > block access to public information about responsibility for the most serious > abuses following the coup d'√©tat. Until then, the attitudes of the coup will > continue to prevail. On 28 March 2012, activist Miriam Miranda was beaten by police and soldiers, arrested and held for 12 hours. Miranda is the president of the Fraternal Black Organization of Honduras (Ofraneh). This organization created Radio Faluma Bimetu (Coco Dulce), a community radio station that has been censored and attacked. Although she has been released, Miranda remains charged with sedition. Radio Progreso journalist Pedro L√≥pez was subsequently arrested. L√≥pez and two other people were detained during a protest against privatization of the education sector, fuel price increases and poor working conditions in garment assembly plants (known as maquilas). Reactions According to other sources consulted by C-Libre, the DNIC knows the names of the men who allegedly murdered H√©ctor Medina Polanco. The organization is also said to know the amount of money they were allegedly paid for carrying out the assassination. Carlos Medina Polanco noted that both President Porfirio Lobo Sosa and Security Minister Oscar √Ålvarez have promised to bring the assassins to justice, but to date they are still awaiting information about any results in the investigation. Mr. Porfirio Lobo Sosa and his allies are trying to reinstate Honduras as an OAS member during the General Assembly next June, shading human rights violations that he frequently calls \\"export political actions by groups that live off that.\\"  References  Category:1974 births Category:2011 deaths Category:Honduran journalists Category:Male journalists Category:Honduran television journalists Category:Murdered journalists Category:Honduran Roman Catholics ","title":"H√©ctor Francisco Medina Polanco"},{"id":"33169245","text":"Mohammed Shu‚Äôi Al-Rabu‚Äôi, also spelled Mohammed Sh√πi Al-Rab√π and Muhammad al- Rabou'e, (1976? - 13 February 2010), was a Yemeni journalist for the monthly magazine Al-Qahira and was killed at his home in the Bani Qa'is District, Hajjah Governorate of Yemen, where he worked for 11 years reporting on crime and corruption cases. His last articles were about a local criminal gang known as the Aouni family, who allegedly were involved in child trafficking. Five members of the Aouni gang killed al-Rabou'e on 13 February 2010 after being released from jail for a previous attack on al-Rabou'e in 2009. Al-Rabou'e's was one of 44 journalists killed in 2010. His death prompted some Yemeni political leaders to meet to discuss how to end violent targeting of journalists in Yemen. He was the first journalist killed in Yemen since the 1990 unification.  Personal  Al-Rabou'e lived in the Beni Qais district in the province of Hajjah and worked for Al-Qahira for 11 years before his murder in 2010. He was 34 years old at the time of his death.  Career  Al- Rabou'e's journalistic work was published in several outlets. The publisher of his last articles was Al-Qahira, a monthly, which is associated with the Al- Islah opposition political party. Al-Rabou'e worked to reveal corruption among the terrorists groups; one particular story al-Rabou'e followed was the extremist gang known as the Aouni family, a local gang group in Yemen, as well as their affiliation with child trafficking. According to NewsWatch, Muhammad al-Rabou'e received several death threats from the gang family several times in order to stop al-Rabou'e from publishing the articles.  Death  The same gang that killed al-Rabou'e on 13 February 2010 had previously attacked him and were arrested, jailed and released in 2009 According to Al-Jazeera, five men invaded al-Rabou'e's Beni Qais home and shot the journalist several times. Most sources say he was shot at his home but one source reported that he was shot at \\"a mountain pass.\\" In an interview with CPJ, Security Chief Abdelrazaq Azzaraq reported that five individuals were arrested and involved in the murder to al-Rabou'e. Azzaraq believes that the murder was a retaliation of al-Rabou'e's articles involving the crime tactics of the family he wrote about near the end of his life. The Aouni family consists of Ahmad Aouni and his four sons. According to CPJ, the Aouni family was arrested back in 2009 for assaulting al-Rabou'e, but were not charged in court and eventually were released.  Context  Al-Rabou'e worked in Yemen, which is located south of Saudi Arabia and west of Oman. Yemen has strict media policies because they are \\"threatened by sectarian rebels in the north, a political protest movement in the south, and increased activity by the terrorist network Al-Qaeda within its borders\\". The country's government is cracking down on the media, prohibiting any material that demoralizes the government and Islamic heritage. In recent years, many journalists have been prosecuted for counts of terrorism. Journalists and media outlets must obtain a permit in order to publish articles in magazines and newspapers as well as to be a journalist. These licenses must be renewed every year for a price (about $3,200). Newspapers that do not follow media conduct laws may lose their license at any time. Although censorship isn't necessarily controlled by the government, news media usually take careful consideration of what they print purely out of fear. Publishers and journalists fear that what they print in media may elicit consequences from particular radical groups and gangs, like in Muhammad al- Rabou'e's case. Journalists are always subject to scrutiny when writing about sensitive topics. Since 2012, three U.S journalists have been deported from Yemen.  Impact  ASl-Rabou'e was the first journalist killed in Yemen since the 1990 unification. Shortly after al-Rabou'e's death, Yemeni journalists, lawyers, and others gathered to discuss ideas that would stop the targeting and violence against journalists. Adbel Bari Tahel, a participant, said journalists, whether visitors or citizens, are \\"the responsibility of the state.\\" His death also prompted some Yemeni political leaders to meet to discuss how to end violent targeting of journalists in Yemen.  Reactions  The editor and chief of Al Qahira, the periodical al-Rabou'e worked for, said that \\"'Al-Rabou‚Äôe was brave and committed to his journalistic mission... He has uncovered many corruption cases in the course of his career and has received many death threats, but not once had he thought of putting an end to his work.'\\" Tawakkol Karman, a journalist, president of Women Journalists Without Chains, and later the 2011 Nobel Peace Prize winner, said, \\"The real battle is between these journalists and terrorists because journalists are the real opponents of terrorism and extremism. They represent a culture of peace, dialogue and co-existence.\\" every day in a (Yemini) journalist's life is a \\"battle against terrorists and extremists.\\" The Yemen Journalist Syndicate released a statement following his murder, in which the organization said, \\"We will never drop our pens, never let the murders flee justice and never leave journalists facing threats alone.\\" After al-Rabou'e's death, the Committee to Protect Journalists released a statement: \\"We are saddened by the murder of Muhammad al-Rabou'e and offer our condolences to his family and colleagues. We urge the prosecution to move quickly to ensure that the perpetrators are held to account.\\"  References  Category:1976 births Category:2010 deaths Category:Crime journalists Category:Deaths by firearm in Yemen Category:Murdered journalists Category:Yemeni journalists ","title":"Muhammad al-Rabou'e"},{"id":"33169250","title":"Karim El-Kerem"},{"id":"33169282","text":"Type 100 rifle grenade launcher The Type 100 grenade discharger was introduced in 1939 as a grenade launcher for the Type 38 and Type 99 Arisaka Rifles.

Updated daily, it covers a wide range of social phenomena. The aim of the blog is to encourage readers to develop a \\"sociological imagination\\" and to learn to see how social institutions, interactions, and ideas affect the individual. Started in 2007 by sociology professor Lisa Wade as a place to swap material for sociology classes, the site developed into a blog aimed at the general public as it attracted more readers. However, the site still includes a strong teaching component, including sample assignments and syllabi for sociology instructors. The site receives about 500,000 visitors per month, most from social media sites and other blogs, such as Jezebel, which partially syndicate it. Reviewers have praised the blog's ability to make sociology accessible to the general public. History Sociological images was founded in 2007 by sociology professor Lisa Wade (Occidental College) and hosted at Blogspot to share ideas and teaching resources with other faculty teaching about sociology. Six professors were invited to serve as the foundational bloggers. Early posts included little text because it was assumed the audience would be academics and thus understand the context of the material. After a few months, Wade and Gwen Sharp (Nevada State College) by dint of being the main content producers took over the blog. While the writers did not originally envision a non-academic audience, the posts started to be shared amongst a large non- academic community, particularly through Facebook and Twitter in the later years of the blog. Wade and Sharp were very surprised to see their posts circulate beyond academics and, initially, a little unsettled to have non- academics commenting. However, seeing their audience grow, they were excited and reimagined the site as a blog devoted to public sociology. In 2008, the editors of Contexts, a magazine published by the American Sociological Association, asked Wade and Sharp if they would be interested in integrating their blog into the website of the magazine and they agreed. In 2010, the editors of the magazine retired but moved the website's content to The Society Pages along with Sociological Images. As Wade and Sharp put it in their history of the blog, \\"with the help of the technical staff at Contexts and the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, Sociological Images became increasingly professional, functional, and multidimensional\\". Wade and Sharp have reflected that as a result of writing and publishing the blog they have become more media literate. For example, they no longer highlight CafePress tshirts, since anyone can put any slogan on one; instead, they choose to highlight influential images. Format and content Body image is one of the topics at the center of Sociological Images' posts. In a post centering around a series of images of exotic dancers from the 1890s, for example, Wade discusses how thinness has been viewed as beautiful only at specific moments in history. Hosted by The Society Pages, which is a hub for social science blogs and websites, Sociological Images is a blog that is updated daily and often between two and four times a day. The posts are written by Gwen Sharp, Lisa Wade and guest contributors. Each post usually features an image, such as a graph, advertisement, commercial, video clip, product, or screenshot, as well as commentary about the image; most of these images are taken from mainstream websites, other social science sites, or reader submissions. Around 50% of the blog posts focus on analyzing these visual elements of culture. The blog covers a wide variety of sociological topics, such as gender inequality, data mapping, homelessness, lesbian politics, and the environment. The most common topics are gender, sexuality, class, nationalism, race, ethnicity, marketing, and body image; in particular, the site focuses on how American popular culture perpetuates gender inequities. Many of the posts are based on items sent in by readers which Wade and Sharp then analyze; they receive an average of 15 to 20 items per day. According to Wade and Sharp, \\"involvement of the readership in this way has undoubtedly been key to the site's success; not only does it ensure a steady stream of content, but it creates a personal connection to the site and engages readers more actively in applying the sociological perspective as they look for relevant examples to submit\\". The site also collects popular posts under its \\"trending\\" tab, recommends posts under \\"editor's favorites\\", and references to posts in the media under \\"In the News\\". As of May 2012, the site had over 4,000 posts archived. The tagline of the blog‚Äî\\"Inspiring sociological imaginations everywhere\\"‚Äîis taken from C. Wright Mills, a famous sociologist. As Wade explains, sociology for her is designed \\"to explain social patterns outside the individual\\" by looking at how culture and institutions affect individuals. Sharp points out that for readers of the blog, sociology can explain why they and their friends enjoy the same brands or how advertising perpetuates gender stereotypes. The blog allows for commenting and from these comments discussions emerge, which one reviewer has called \\"intelligent, respectful, and constructive\\". Wade and Sharp themselves have reflected on the different expectations readers have for the commenting space on their blog: \\"While we understand the arguments for creating safe spaces for the constructive discussion of race, gender, sexual orientation, and other issues, particularly for those groups who may face prejudice or discrimination, ensuring a truly safe space has proven impossible\\". Noting that the blog receives 500 to 750 comments on average per week, they had to make some decisions about how to handle the traffic. As of May 2012, the site used Disqus to moderate its comments. Users must create a profile to comment and other readers can flag comments that are inappropriate. Any comments that insult or threaten other commenters are deleted, but criticisms of Wade and Sharp's posts remain; they often highlight these rebuttals in updates to the posts or subsequent posts. More importantly, any mistakes Wade and Sharp make in the posts remain; they are fixed with updates or comments, but blog post remain in their original published format. As Wade and Sharp explain, they want to model the learning process for their readers. They feel that it is important to be able to admit mistakes and learn from them in public so that their readers will feel comfortable doing this as well. In her review of Sociological Images, Karen McCormack identifies four different types of posts throughout the blog: visual plus, text plus, open post, and data display. In the visual plus posts, the images dominate and little text is needed to explain the point of the post. For example, she highlights a post from 14 January 2011, \\"Glamorizing Brutality toward Women\\", that juxtaposes a series of images and videos \\"to expose the acceptability of violence against women\\" and how \\"the more mundane images of violence are consistent with the more grotesque and disturbing\\". These kinds of posts are often filled with historical images \\"to highlight continuity or change over time\\", such as the ways in which different racial groups have been dehumanized through animal- like caricature. These historical trends are some of the most highlighted and praised posts by reviewers. For example, one interviewer praised The White Woman's Burden, which demonstrated the consistent colonial impulse in advertising. Text plus posts use visuals to augment the words; the majority of these posts make readers aware of sociological arguments in other fora, such as TED talks or New York Times editorials. They summarize and link to these longer form arguments. Open posts \\"treat the images and videos as polysemic - open to multiple and contradictory interpretations from the audience\\". These are \\"less analytic and more provocative\\", prompting readers to ask and answer questions. For example, in a post about color photos from the Great Depression, images dominate and the post ends with a question: \\"are we more able to relate to the people in the photographs because they are in colour? Do we experience less distance between their lives and our own because the medium is both more familiar and closer to what we see?\\" Data display posts visualize complex data so that readers can understand difficult issues in new ways; they also link readers to sites with interactive mapping tools and other kinds of software that enable them to make their own projects. McCormack points to one particularly good example of this kind of post, a video of Hans Rosling explaining the relationship between wealth and life expectancy throughout the world over the past 200 years. Some of the posts explain specific scholarly theories for the general reader. For example, in Hand Sapolio Soap Will Make You ‚ÄúWelcome Among the Best People‚Äù, Sharp uses vintage soap advertisements to explain Joan Jacobs Brumberg's theories about how culture constructs a connection between girls' hygiene and feelings of personal worth. In general, the site builds on the scholarly work of advertising scholars Jean Kilbourne and Sut Jhally. As Wade and Sharp point out, they try to \\"pull back the curtain\\" on marketing and advertising in their blog. For example, they discuss how advertising has co-opted the language of \\"choice\\" from feminism and pro- choice campaigns in order to sell cosmetics. =Abercrombie & Fitch bikini top= On 19 March 2011, Sociological Images published a post which reported that Abercrombie & Fitch was marketing push up bikini tops at young girls, asking \\"so, at what age should girls start trying to enhance their cleavage?\\" Consumers demanded change from the company; as a result, Abercrombie had changed their campaign, describing their tops as \\"padded\\". Wade and Sharp write in an article mentioning this incident that \\"the Abercrombie post had an unusually powerful effect, but Sociological Images routinely receives e-mails and comments from public relations departments of companies responsible for advertisements or products that are analyzed on the site\\". =Princess Tiana and watermelon candy= On 12 March 2012, Sociological Images published a post arguing that using the Disney character Tiana to advertise watermelon candy perpetrated the racist watermelon stereotype. This criticism was reported on some other blogs. Teaching tool In Child Labor and the Social Construction of Childhood, Sharp demonstrates how Lewis Hine's photographs of laboring children illustrate that the definition and conception of \\"childhood\\" changes over time. Sociological Images is designed to be used as a teaching tool as well as a blog. It is aimed at both lower- and upper-division undergraduates and is a \\"useful resource to connect classroom work with popular culture and media imagery\\" as well as \\"extremely useful for instructors who wish to keep pace with the abundant ways that popular culture reifies discrimination\\". Its content applies to courses in sociology, social science methods, media studies, gender studies, and courses focused on race, ethnicity and class. Wade and Sharp include sample assignments that allow instructors to integrate the blog into class work. For example, students can write a post and submit it to the blog. They can also select an advertisement that revolves around \\"sex, race, gender, family roles, nationality or class\\" and then find additional advertisements on their own, writing an analysis of the implicit messages in the set. In her review of the blog, Karen McCormack describes how well the posts lend themselves to generating class discussion. She cites the post \\"The Double Standard in Sexualizing Teen Celebrities\\" as one way to spark discussion; \\"while students may disagree about differences in male and female vulnerability and sexuality, a class exploring gender could be enhanced by referring to the images as a way of focusing discussion on the larger issue of how different groups are represented differently and unequally\\". McCormack also points out that the high-quality comments on the blog \\"provide a strong model for students learning to read and analyse critically\\". The site also includes course guides that organize posts from the blog around frequently taught sociology concepts. Wade and Sharp have also created a complementary Pinterest board that organizes the images from Sociological Images into 23 topic areas, such as race, heteronormativity, sexy toy makeovers, and gendered parenting and housework. Reception =Site statistics and publicity= Sociological Images receives about 500,000 visitors each month. As of 2011, the site was visited over 7 million times with a total of 11.4 million page views. It has over 20,000 RSS subscribers, 16,000 Facebook readers, 7,000 Twitter subscribers, and 10,000 readers on Pinterest. The site is partially syndicated on two high-profile blogs, namely Jezebel and Ms. Posts from Sociological Images have also been reposted at Racialicious, Adios Barbie, Love Isn't Enough, Scientopia, Owni, and Conhecimento Prudente. As a result of the publicity from the blog, Wade and Sharp are often consulted by media outlets as experts. The \\"In the News\\" section lists over 100 appearances, including outlets such as NPR and CNN. Wade and Sharp believe that their post Evolution of Evony Video Game Ads is their most popular post. Readers of Sociological Images tend to be between 18 and 34 years old, female and college educated, with incomes of less than $60,000. Forty-nine percent of readers are in the United States, 10% from Western Europe, 10% from Canada, 5% from India, and 2% from Australia. Readers are drawn to the site in a variety of ways, some as part of their daily reading habits and some through internet searching, such as through the phrase \\"Disney princess\\". Social networking sites also account for a significant amount of the site's traffic. Over 700,000 visits in 2011 came from Facebook and 50,000 from Twitter. Reposts on other sites also bring in a significant amount of traffic. For example, Feministing and Jezebel each accounted for 50,000 visitors in 2011. News aggregators also bring in a substantial number as well; reddit brought in 125,000 in 2011. =Reviews= Sociological Images was reviewed by Karen McCormack in Visual Studies. She praised the blog's ability to explain sociology to those outside academia, writing that \\"the most exciting thing about Sociological images is that it can truly bring sociology to everyone\\", but she did point out some \\"drawbacks\\" to the blog form itself, such as the lack of space to discuss the original context for some of the images. It was also reviewed by David T. Mayeda in Teaching Sociology, who praised it as \\"an insightful, thought-provoking site that can be used by sociology instructors and students\\". He particularly highlights the ways in which the authors \\"show how discriminatory imagery evolves over time, preserving dominant narratives in society, but manifesting in different ways depending on the social context\\". He emphasizes that the audience of the site is not other academics, pointing out that the site \\"tends not to provide deeper theoretical rhetoric in its entries\\". In their review of the site, MERLOT (Multimedia Educational Resource for Learning and Online Teaching), wrote that the site \\"strongly encourages us to develop our sociological imaginations by presenting brief discussions of timely and compelling imagery, spanning the breadth of sociological inquiry\\". Male privilege and entitlement posts on the site tend to receive the greatest volume of negative reactions. Readers will sometimes argue that gender equity already exists and that Wade and Sharp are reading \\"too much into\\" the images. In particular, posts that deconstruct sexual power dynamics and sexual violence are some that receive the most resistance. People are scared to realize, Wade says, that \\"their body has internalized\\" these gender expectations. Moreover, while the site's posts on gender inequity are often \\"routinely praised\\" by many readers, they are also linked to by men's rights groups, attracting criticism. But it is posts about fat and health related to weight that bring out the most hurtful speech in the comments. Sharp mentions in an interview that she has to take significantly more time out to monitor the site after she posts on these topics to delete and respond to fat-shaming. =Awards= * 2009, Pacific Sociological Association * 2012, American Sociological Association Section on Communication and Information Technologies * 2012, University of Minnesota Sociology Department References External links * * Sociological Images on Pinterest * Lisa Wade * Gwen Sharp Category:American blogs Category:Science blogs Category:Sociology Category:Internet properties established in 2007 ","title":"Sociological Images"},{"id":"33169307","text":"The was a fragmentation hand grenade deployed by the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II.

He became Grand Inquisitor of Spain (and thus head of the Spanish Inquisition) in April 1793, but was forced to resign the next year, probably because he attempted to institute reforms to make the Spanish Inquisition less secretive.

Breckinridge. On April 9, 1862, it was transferred from Memphis to a camp near Cornith, Mississippi under difficult conditions. In a April 11, 1862 letter to his wife, Captain Walter Greenfield writes: On July 3, 1862, it was ordered with Clayton's 2nd Alabama Cavalry against the Federals at Booneville, MS, who were completely routed. Together with the 2nd Missouri Cavalry, it was ordered under Gen. Frank C. Armstrong to Tennessee, where it met at Middleburg, TN, the Federals under Colonel Leggett and defeated them, killing and wounding large numbers of the Federal force. In late July 1862, the 2nd Arkansas, under Col. Slemons, along with the 2nd Missouri and the 4th Mississippi engaged the escort of Federal cavalry and artillery guarding a train of supplies at Britton's Lane, TN, and after a stubborn fight of three hours captured the train, along with 300 prisoners and two pieces of artillery. The 2nd Arkansas lost 70 men killed or wounded in this engagement. In the campaigns of Price and Pemberton in early 1863 defending the approaches to Vicksburg, the 2nd Arkansas was in continuous active service, opposing Federal thrusts at Iuka, Colliersville, Salem, the Yazoo Pass, at Charleston, Austin, and near Commerce, Mississippi and along the Coldwater River. Under the command of Major General Nathan Bedford Forrest in late 1863, it participated in the masterly movements of that greatest of cavalry commanders, encircling armies, taking cities, capturing trains, and burning bridges. =Transferred to the Trans-Mississippi= By late 1863, the 2nd Arkansas Cavalry had been greatly reduced by casualties and absenteeism. On August 4, 1863, Colonel Slemon's wrote to his wife regarding the condition on his command saying, > nearly half of my men are sick now and the prospect very [?] that the other > half will run off soon they some where caught the infection from the people > here Col Withers has tendered his resignation says he cant soldier on this > side the River [think] he is whiped [sic] he puts it upon the grounds of his > family. I have not heard from my application to transfer my command across > the river. On August 11, Slemons again wrote about his men gradually slipping back west of the Mississippi River, > Col Withers has gone home again I hope he will stay this time has tendered > his resignation he is worth nothing to the service with me some of my men > have run off it is reported that he told them if they would report over time > it would be all right I have 20 men in pursuit of them hope to catch them > before they get over the river. On August 13 Slemons wrote: > pretty often now my men are crossing the river very Rapidly I fear Brother > Withers has acted badly the men charge him [?] but say nothing of this to > any one It may be doing him injustice but he is certainly very > [trifling].... If my men keep running away they will soon all be gone the > weather is exceedingly warm and many of the men are sick Jackson and Tillman > are both sick also Garison has been and still sick in the country Bilious > fever he has authority to go home and rase [sic] a company will start as > soon as he is able to travel The President has issued his proclamation > pardoning all deserters who return to units in 20 days after his order is > published in This State also returning all who are in prison convicted of > Desertion this county full of them doing all kind of Devilment. An again on August 25, 1863, Colonel Slemons wrote, > My Reg [sic] is well nigh broken up I suppose Withers is the cause of it > from what I can hear It is possible that I will get a transfer for the [?] > of my Reg [sic] though Gnl [sic] Lee offers me any commd [sic] I may desire > on this side. On September 4, 1862, Col Slemons wrote \\"I shall send some officers over in a few days to gather up my Deserters may possibly come myself.\\" It appears that the officers that Colonel Slemons sent west of the Mississippi River were successful in reassembling parts of the regiment, but they did not rejoin Colonel Slemons on the east side of the river. This led to the existence of one group known as McMurtrey's Arkansas Cavalry Battalion, commanded by Captain E. L. McMurtrey of the 2nd Arkansas, and a second group known as the 2nd Arkansas Cavalry Regiment, under the command of Captain O B. Tebbs, operating in the Confederate Department of the Trans-Mississippi before the regiment was officially transferred to that Department from the Department of Mississippi and East Louisiana. And December 9, 1863: On October 18, 1863, General Orders No. 86, Headquarters Cavalry in Northern Mississippi listed Colonel Slemons in command of a brigade consisting of the 2nd Arkansas Cavalry, 3rd Regiment Mississippi State Cavalry, 7th Regiment Tennessee Cavalry, Colonel George's Cavalry Regiment and McLendon's Battery of 6 pounders.United States.

The school was built on land purchased by the black community and donated to the county. It was the only high school for African-American students until the end of segregation in Loudoun County in 1968. Description Douglass High School is a one-story brick building, originally of . The plan is centered on a commons area that functioned as a gymnasium, cafeteria and auditorium, flanked by two classrooms on either side. Large windows light and ventilate the spaces. A large stage area is directly opposite the main entrance, which opens directly into the commons area from a vestibule. Classrooms were added on the rear of the building, followed by a gymnasium in 1960. A vocational wing lies to the west. History Until 1941, the only secondary educational facility available to African-American students in Loudoun County was the upper level of the Loudoun County Training School. The frame structure offered a limited curriculum in an unsafe building. During the late 1930s the black community in Loudoun County organized fundraiser events to purchase of land on the east side of Leesburg from W.S. Gibbons. The property was conveyed to Loudoun County for $1 on December 16, 1940. After threats of legal action, the school board approved a measure to borrow $30,000 from the State Literary Fund of Virginia to build the school. A bid from the Taylor Manufacturing Company of Farmville, Virginia was approved for $35,438. The school opened in September 1941. The school was named for African-American abolitionist Frederick Douglass at the request of the community organizers. Since a bare minimum of furnishings were provided by the county, more private donations were sought to more fully furnish the school. With desegregation in 1968 the building became a middle school, then a special education and alternative school. Douglass High School was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 24, 1992.

A registered sex offender involved in five cases of kidnapping and sexual assault prior to Poirier's murder, he is suspected of being a serial killer by case investigators. Blom is serving his prison sentence at MCF-Faribault, a medium-security facility in Faribault, Minnesota.  Early life  Donald Blom's father abused him from the time Blom was very young until he was around 13 years old. By the time he reached adolescence, Blom was a heavy drinker and exhibited behavioral problems. In the 10th grade, he went to a reform school, where he often skipped classes. In 1975, Blom kidnapped a 14-year-old girl, gagged her and raped her. He locked her in his car trunk, but she managed to escape and turn him in. Blom was tried and convicted. In 1978, he committed aggravated assault. In 1983, he was arrested for criminal sexual conduct. The same year, he threatened two teenage girls at knifepoint in a remote area, tied them to a tree and put socks in their mouths. He choked and revived one of them several times and said he was going to rape them. The girls were rescued when a police officer saw their car parked the wrong way and investigated. Blom fled into the woods and later changed his appearance by dyeing his hair. He was arrested two months later when one of the girls recognized him. He pleaded guilty to the crime. During an examination in 1992, a psychologist predicted that if Blom was not closely monitored, he would probably engage in additional antisocial behavior; however, Blom managed to change his name, get a job and get married. By May 1999, he had six felony convictions, five of which involved kidnapping and sexual assault.  Katie Poirier's murder  On May 26, 1999, 19-year-old Katie Elizabeth Poirier went missing from D. J.'s Expressway Conoco convenience store in Moose Lake, Minnesota, where she worked nights as a clerk. A passer-by, who noticed that there was no attendant present in the store, reported the incident. A grainy black-and-white surveillance video showed Poirier being forced out of the store around 11:40 pm by a man wearing jeans, a backwards baseball cap and a New York Yankees baseball jersey with the number 23 on the back. The man's hand was at the back of Poirier's neck, and from the way she touched her throat, there might have been a cord tied around her neck. The video was sent to imaging specialists at NASA who were able to enhance the image so more details of the suspect could be seen. The police estimated that the abductor was 5'10\\" and weighed around 170 pounds, had long light-colored hair and appeared to be around 25 years old. Witnesses reported that they had seen a black pick-up truck circling the area around the convenience store that evening. One of the witnesses gave a partial license plate number (three numbers and a letter). Another witness reported seeing a suspicious man leering at female passersby outside a Subway restaurant in the same building as the convenience store earlier that night. The suspect was allegedly driving the same black pick-up truck other witnesses had described. Based on this and three other witness statements, a composite sketch of the abductor was broadcast by local media. = Blom's arrest = Blom was investigated soon after Poirier's disappearance since he was the registered owner of a pickup truck with a license plate number matching the partial number provided by a witness. Blom was working at the Minnesota Veteran's Home under the name \\"Donald Hutchinson\\" prior to Poirier's death. On June 18, his former co- worker, Darrel Brown, called the police tip line and said Donald Hutchison looked similar to the man in the composite sketch provided by police. Brown said Hutchinson was absent on the day after Poirier's abduction, had recently cut his hair, had stopped driving his black pick-up truck and without notice quit his job as a janitor. Blom owned a 20-acre property in Moose Lake, 12 miles from the convenience store from which Poirier was abducted. Investigators learned of Blom's prior convictions for abducting seven young girls. They also learned from Blom's neighbors that Blom spent a lot of time at the property before Poirier's abduction, but hadn't been there since. Blom was spending time with his family at a campground 140 miles from his home in Richfield, Minnesota when initially questioned by agents from Minnesota's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension on June 22. He was arrested later that day while driving home. Blom was friendly and cooperative, but refused to give a statement and requested an attorney. He was initially held in a county facility, but was placed in solitary confinement after his plans to escape from the facility were discovered. Investigators obtained search warrants and searched Blom's Richfield residence and Moose Lake property. The search in Moose Lake was supported by over 100 National Guardsmen and several hundred local volunteers who were initially unable to find any trace of Poirier. They did find some firearms, which Blom was not allowed to carry given his prior convictions. On the second day of the search, investigators found what appeared to be bone fragments in a fire pit on Blom's property. The fragments were sent to a lab, where they were identified as human bone and a charred portion of a human tooth. DNA tests proved inconclusive, but an examination by dental experts established that the filling on this tooth matched that of a very rare filling material used by Poirier's dentist. The examination showed the tooth belonged to a young female and was likely Poirier's. On September 8, Blom confessed to abducting Poirier, strangling her and burning her body in the fire pit on his Moose Lake property, an account which was somewhat inconsistent with the evidence. Surveillance video from the convenience store showed a man with his hand on the back of Poirier's neck. Blom stated that he walked out of the store with Poirier and said she asked him to let her go several times, but did not fight with him until he started choking her at his property. Blom also said that he killed Poirier with his bare hands and burned her body with wood and paper. According to investigators, wood and paper alone would not have been sufficient to reduce a human body to ash. Blom denied sexually assaulting Poirier and said he did not know why he had committed the crime. When asked whether the remains in the fire pit were those of Poirer, he said, \\"I guess so\\". When pressed, he said he \\"didn't know the answer to this question.\\" When asked whose remains they were, Blom replied, \\"Well, I was asking that myself, man.\\" Blom soon recanted, saying that the stress of the solitary confinement and hallucinations due to \\"ten medications\\" had prompted him to make a false confession. = Trial = Blom's trial began in June 2000. Over 50 witnesses were called to testify during the case. Video surveillance, witness reports, testimonies from two women who Blom kidnapped in 1983 and his confession were presented as evidence against him. Blom said he never owned a New York Yankees jersey with the number 23 on the back like the one worn by the man in the surveillance video; however, Blom's brother testified that he had given the Blom family a box of old clothing which included a Yankees jersey. The two women who Blom kidnapped in 1983 and who resembled Poirier as children testified about what he had done to them. Forensic odontologist Dr. Ann Norrlander testified that the tooth portion recovered from Blom's property was consistent with Poirier's age, gender and dental work. Blom's barber confirmed that Blom's hair had blond tips at the time of the abduction, making him appear younger (the man in the surveillance video was assumed to be around 25 years old while Blom was 50 at the time of the crime). Blom's defense attorney, Rodney Brodin, presented Blom's wife, Amy, as his first witness on August 7. She testified that Blom returned home at 9:30 on the night of Poirier's disappearance, they went to bed and when she woke up in the morning, a pot of coffee had been made; therefore, she believed, Blom had been home the entire night. She also accused the police of threatening to take her children away if she did not answer questions the way they wanted. She also denied seeing any baseball jersey in the clothing given to the family by Blom's brother. Brodin restated to the jurors that only one of six witnesses was able to identify Blom in a line-up. He also called upon his own odontologist to counter the testimony of the prosecution's dental experts. He stated that Blom's earlier confession was a mistake and should not be taken into account. He claimed that another man had confessed to the crime, but was not arrested. During his trial, Blom expressed angrily to Poirier's family that he was not guilty and had a heated exchange of words with Poirier's mother. On August 10, he denied kidnapping Poirier. He said his wife had threatened to commit suicide due to media pressure and that he confessed to the kidnapping in order to get out of his cell. He said he had been fishing at Moose Lake on the evening of the kidnapping and returned home by 10:00 pm, well before the time of Poirier's abduction. The prosecutor, Thomas Pertler, cross examined Blom about his confession, but Blom gave only \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" answers. Blom also said he had never seen the baseball jersey before and that people who claimed to have seen him wear it were mistaken. After much deliberation, Blom was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life without parole. He was also given a 19-year sentence for possession of firearms found at his property. = Aftermath = By the time of Blom's conviction, over $200,000 had been spent on the case. The state legislature strengthened Minnesota sex offender laws with longer prison terms for repeat offenders, a bill informally known as \\"Katie‚Äôs Law.\\" Blom appealed his conviction. His wife emailed two Minnesota legislators, stating that she believed him to be Poirier's murderer and that Blom abused her for seven years. She said she did not know when she married Blom that he had been married twice before, and that when Blom adopted her surname, she was flattered, not knowing he did so to conceal his past. She said Blom went to the Moose Lake property frequently and told her little. She believed that he had committed other crimes, including murder. No longer under his domination, she said she could tell the truth: he was not home on the night of Poirier's kidnapping. Blom's sons confirmed the violent abuse, describing his wife's injuries. In 2004, an appeals court upheld Blom's conviction. In 2006, Blom expressed his willingness to answer questions about unsolved local crimes in exchange for transfer to a prison closer to his relatives. When detectives arrived with the transfer letter, Blom talked about other matters for three days and a confession never materialized. In December 2007, the Minnesota Supreme Court rejected Blom's third petition for a new hearing.  Possible links to other crimes  Investigators believe Blom may have been involved in a series of murders, possibly dating back to the 1970s. They believe that his modus operandi was to change his name and appearance after each incident. Dennis Fier, a Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension agent, has long suspected Blom to be a serial killer. According to Fier, Blom admitted that he \\"often would leave for entire nights, would be using alcohol and drugs and would not remember when he came home the next day, where he had been or what he did.\\" At the time of his arrest, investigators were looking at similar crimes, including the murder of 19-year-old Wisconsin student Holly Spangler. In 1993, Spangler's decomposed body was found in the woods of a Bloomington, Minnesota park. Blom was living in the area under the name \\"Donald Pince,\\" was a registered sex offender and was one of the top suspects in the case. Another case studied by investigators was the strangulation of Wilma Johnson, whose body was found near St. Paul Cathedral in 1983. Blom admitted to being at the crime scene, but denied killing Johnson. Blom told investigators he might have killed a man near St. Paul's High Bridge, but a body was never found.  In popular culture  The story of Poirier's murder has been the subject of many television true crime documentaries. HLN TV reported the story in the Forensic Files series episode \\"Tooth or Consequences\\". The Discovery Channel reported the case via The New Detectives series episode \\"Fatal Abductions\\".

In its previous separate incarnation known as Ministry of Sound (UK) Pty Ltd and then Ministry of Sound Australia Pty Ltd, it was Australia's largest dance music label as well as one of Australia's largest independent labels overall, being spun off into a separate independent company with exclusive licence to the Ministry of Sound trademarks in Australia & New Zealand in 2004. In 2016, after the announcement that the Ministry of Sound Group had sold Ministry of Sound Recordings to Sony Music Entertainment UK, Ministry of Sound Australia Managing Director Tim McGee announced that as a result the Australian operations would be forced to rebrand as TMRW Music Group, with all Ministry of Sound recordings-related IP in Australia to be handled by Sony Music Entertaiment Australia as of July 2017. TMRW Music Group retains the licence for all Ministry of Sound-branded music events and touring, including operating Ministry of Sound's Australian nightclub based in Sydney on behalf of Ministry of Sound Group. MoSA also owns Central Station Records, rescuing it from financial collapse in 2009. Ministry of Sound Australia also runs its own sub-labels which have signed many popular artists from Australia and overseas over the years and have been instrumental in helping launch the successful careers of Australian House DJ/Producers e.g. Tommy Trash, Hook N Sling, Stafford Brothers, The Aston Shuffle & Tonite Only. Every MoSA compilation released since 2001 have held No.1 chart positions on the ARIA compilation, club and dance charts. From 1999-2007 Ministry of Sound Australia CDs were distributed by EMI Music Group Australia. From 2008 onwards Ministry of Sound Australia is distributed by Universal Music Australia. Notable DJs who have mixed MoSA compilations over the years include Tall Paul, Oski, Hydraulix, Groove Terminator, Mark Dynamix, Hook N Sling, Kid Kenobi, John Course, Axwell, Goodwill, Sean Quinn, DJ Brendon, The Aston Shuffle, MYNC, Steve Aoki, Stafford Brothers, Tommy Trash and The Bloody Beetroots. On 19 June 2017 MoSA announced that it would rebrand itself as TMRW Music. All future Ministry of Sound compilations will be released through Sony Music, while TMRW will continue to distribute its Hussle, Downright and Astrx sublabels. The company's touring and events businesses, Ministry of Sound Club and other MoS-branded events and tours will not be rebranded. History Ministry of Sound's presence has been felt in Australia since 1995 when MDS, a subsidiary of Festival Mushroom Records released Dance Nation. MDS released Parts 2 and 3 in 1996 and 1997 respectively and all were direct copies of the UK releases, as well as Sessions. Ministry of Sound UK had been doing tours in Australia previous to Ministry of Sound Australia's establishment in late 1999, conducting national tours in 1997 and 1998. Both events coincided with Australian albums Ministry of Sound: Australian Tour '97 and Ministry of Sound: Australian Tour '98 which were sold and released by Festival Mushroom Records. The popularity of these tours and the CDs prompted Ministry of Sound UK to establish itself in Australia in 1999 and released its first compilation, Clubber's Guide to... Australia. Ministry of Sound Australia was founded in 1999 by Sydney DJ Tim McGee and executives from Ministry of Sound UK, while McGee was an employee of Central Station Records. Ministry of Sound Australia was then known as Ministry of Sound (UK) Pty Ltd and ran the basic operations of the Australian subsidiary as well as Tim McGee's Hussle Recordings which he incorporated into Ministry of Sound (UK) at its founding and began a distribution agreement with EMI. In 2000, Ministry of Sound Australia produced its first compilation Album: Club Nation 2000, which was mixed by Mark Dynamix and Groove Terminator. Clubber's Guide to... Australia and The Summer Annual - Summer 2000 were produced by Ministry UK for MoSA and mixed by Australian DJs except for Tall Paul. In late 2000, Tim McGee left Central Station to head up Ministry of Sound Australia full-time. On 2 March 2009, Ministry of Sound Australia announced that it had acquired Central Station Records, Australia's oldest dance label after facing bankruptcy and liquidation due to the global financial crisis. Under this arrangement, Ministry of Sound Australia will have ownership over the label, MoSA's distributor Universal Music Australia will manage artist single and album projects and Central Station Records will handle the compilations, marketing, promotions and tours. In 2011, Ministry of Sound Australia celebrated 10 years of The Annual in Australia and released \\"The Annual: 10 Years\\" which was mixed by John Course and Mark Dynamix. Albums Ministry of Sound Australia releases its own compilations and singles, most of which are mixed by prolific DJs from Australia and occasionally overseas although rarely release compilations mixed in-house e.g. Anthems. Ministry of Sound Australia through its labels release albums and singles from international artists e.g. The Bloody Beetroots, Example, Timmy Trumpet, Will Sparks, Chardy, New World Sound, Scndl, Reece Low, Raven & Kreyn, Uberjak'd and Axwell. MoSA has moved away from selling singles physically and prefer to release them via iTunes's Australian store and artists signed to MoSA also have their tracks released via Beatport although albums released by MoSA are still sold physically. =Compilation series released by Ministry of Sound Australia= * Clubbers Guide to... * Turn Up Trap * The Annual * The Summer Annual * Anthems * Clubbers Guide To Breaks * Sessions * Chillout Sessions * Clubbers Guide To Spring * Progression * House Sessions * Best Of Blutonium Hardstyle * Sound of Dubstep * Kid Kenobi Sessions * Hard NRG * Dance Nation * Club Nation * Trance Nation * Housexy * Mashed * SessioNZ (New Zealand exclusive) * Maximum Bass * Maximum Bass Xtreme * Electro House Sessions * Uncovered * In The Club! * The Underground * Running Trax * Addicted To Bass * Futurism * Vicious Cuts (Produced in conjunction with Vicious Recordings) =One-off compilations released by Ministry of Sound Australia= * Clubber's Guide to...

One of these was at Scituate, Rhode Island. Others were at Fort Ward (Washington), Winter Harbor, Maine, Amagansett, New York, Cheltenham, Maryland and Jupiter, Florida. About one year before the United States entered WW2 Thomas B. Cave was sent to Rhode Island to set up a secret radio listening post. The purpose of the post was to detect radio transmissions from German spies in the United States and assist in locating downed aircraft. In March 1941 he abandoned his first choice of Greenville, RI for a farmhouse with 183 acres of land located on Darby Road near Chopmist Hill in Scituate, Rhode Island. The FCC leased the farmhouse from Mr. William A. Suddard.Providence Journal 11/22/1945 The completed listening post contained over 80,000 feet of wire, 11 antennas and many advanced radio receivers.NSA History Today Articles, 30 March 2010 The site included two direction finding antennas. These could be rotated to get a bearing on the transmitting station. This information when compared with similar measurements from other distant stations allowed the transmitting location to be triangulated. The use of two of these antennas meant both parties in a conversion could be located.Providence Journal 11/22/1945 Reception The resulting listening site had characteristics way above what had been hoped for. A variety of signals was picked up with a regularity that cannot be explained. In Mr. Cave's words \\"This site was the best location in the country for radio transmission and reception\\".Providence Journal 11/22/1945 This site as well as others was a well-guarded secret until the FCC authorized a reporter to visit the site in March 1945.Providence Journal 11/22/1945 Countries heard =Caribbean= The quick response of this station allowed it to home in on German submarines in the Caribbean prompting the supervisor to state that \\"we were practically in on the kill\\" when describing the destruction of German Submarines.Providence Journal 11/23/1945 =Africa= From West Africa a large variety of clandestine radio transmitters was detected . In the African desert not only were the German command center-to-tank transmissions received but also tank-to-tank transmissions were clearly audible. The reception of these signals helped to turn the tide in the North Africa campaign.Providence Journal 11/22/1945 =South America= From South America spies transmitting back to Germany were detected and most countries cooperated in efforts to shut down the transmissions. The one exception to this was Argentina with its Pro Nazi Sympathies. One report sent to German submarines contained the scheduled departure date of the Queen Mary as well as its intended route to Australia. The destruction of this ship along with its 14,000 soldiers would have been a heavy blow but this was prevented by the eavesdropping ability of Chopmist Hill.Providence Journal 11/22/1945 =Pacific Ocean= From the Pacific Ocean signals were picked up of TNT-carrying Japanese balloons that had been released to follow the jet stream to the United States. The positions of these balloons was transmitted to Allied forces who shot them down.Providence Journal 11/22/1945 =East Coast= On the East Coast of the United States from Labrador to Florida signals of lost planes were picked up. Their position was triangulated and instructions to the planes were transmitted to enable them to arrive in the United States. This action saved thousands of people including actress Kay Francis who was returning home after a USO tour.Providence Journal 11/23/1945 =Germany= Vital local weather reports for the Germany homeland were purposely transmitted on frequencies that did not reach England but these transmissions were detected at Chopmist Hill. Disbelief from the Army Approximately 127 tests were made to ensure the site was able to accomplish what it claimed to do. In one test a station was set up in the Pentagon with a wire hanging out a window to transmit a signal. The object was to see how long it would take various receiving stations to detect this signal. Chopmist Hill detected it in seven minutes.Providence Journal 11/22/1945 Site for the UN When the war ended Chopmist Hill's remarkable reception and transmission abilities led to its being considered as a site for the soon-to-be constructed United Nations Complex. This plan was abandoned when John Rockefeller donated funds to purchase a 16-acre site on the East River in New York City.here.

Detroit Beer Co. is a brewpub located on Broadway Street in downtown Detroit, Michigan, United States. Detroit Beer Co. opened in the fall of 2003 and is part of a trio of local breweries, including the Royal Oak Brewery (1995) and the Rochester Mills Beer Co. (1998). The Detroit Beer Co. was launched by Drew Ciora and Mike Pelsz, who purchased and renovated the historical Hartz building at a cost of $5.3 million.Detroit Free Press 2003-08-30 Brewpub Readies for Downtown City's Restaurant Scene, Gallagher, John The Hartz Building was an early 20th-century surgical supply store and was renovated to accommodate a restaurant, brewery equipment, office space, and even a loft apartment. Within close proximity of both Comerica Park and Ford Field,Midwest Microbrews - Detroit Beer Company is readily accessible for fans of those teams within the Motor City.  History  Significant to the development of Detroit Beer Co. is its location in Detroit, Michigan. The city of Detroit continues to work hard at its revival and renaissance begun in the 1990s and Detroit Beer Co. has become a part that revival, as well.Midwest Microbrews - Detroit Beer Co. Detroit Beer Co. is housed in the historic 100-year-old Hartz Building at 1529 Broadway Street; it is part of the Broadway Avenue Historic District located on a single block along Broadway Avenue between Gratiot and East Grand River. The Hartz building is in the center of a cultural and sporting spot in Detroit, with the Detroit Opera house standing across the street, and Comerica Park and Ford Field both short walks away. The six-story Hartz building was built in 1902; it was named after J. Frederick Hartz, who was Chairman of the Board of the J.F. Hartz Company, a medical and surgical supply company. Malcomson & Higginbotham, architects, 1902. J. Frederick Hartz, the namesake of this building, was Chairman of the board of the J.F. Hartz Company, suppliers of medical supplies and surgical instruments for physicians, nurses, hospitals and sick rooms. Malcomson and Higginson, architects, were issued the building permit for the construction of the building for Hartz. It was to cost an estimated $15,000. Also located in the Hartz Building in 1907 were Silverman Bernd, cigar manufacturer; the Detroit Medical Journal Company; E.C. Moore & son Company, dental specialties; Ideal Belt Company, Illustrated medical Journal Company, and J.H. Bishop Company, clothing manufacturers. The Hartz Building was originally built as a three-story brick building articulated as a single bay. A fourth floor was added in 1926/27 (Alt. permit 7433-A, 11/30/1926) at a cost of $25,000. Stone quoins framed its front facade and bands of seven windows with transoms filled the single horizontal opening per floor above the store level. The first floor was remodeled in the early 1990s, and continued at that time to retain its recessed entrance... The building was thriving in the early 1990s with the support and encouragement of Ray Parker of RFP Associates, Inc., (a commercial and residential real estate business founded in 1988) who inspired Detroit Businesses ~ Wanda's Interior Images, Moore African Art, Kente Kurtains & More, Detroit-Windsor Dance Academy, LaCouture, and Robert Lett to lease space in The Hartz Building. At that time, Ray Parker's passion for and love of architecture spoke volumes in relation to his commitment to rebuilding and revitalizing downtown Detroit. With The Greystone Jazz Museum situated right next door to 1529 Broadway, all of the businesses collaborated by participating in the Greater Downtown Detroit Historic Association, The Fox Theatre Tours, Gallery Crawls, and the NAACP's support and promotion of African American Businesses in Downtown Detroit. The momentum built, and many News Articles followed, sparking further interest and attention to the new businesses in The Hartz Building. The Grand Opening of the three first floor businesses of The Hartz Building‚ÄîWanda's Interior Images, Moore African Art, and Kente Kurtains & More, had over 750 invited guests in attendance. Including the Mayor of the City of Detroit, City Council Members, Judges, Members of the Board of Directors of Boysville of Michigan, NAACP Officials, and many Detroit Business Owners. News Articles followed with write-ups in The Detroit News, The Detroit Free Press, Crain's Detroit Business, Metro Times, On Detroit, and many others. The Detroit Opera House broke ground, restored, and reopened directly across the street (located at 1526 Broadway Street) shortly thereafter. Architect Eric J. Hill participated in an extensive restoration of The Detroit Opera House which reopened in 1996. In the early 2000s the Hartz building underwent a complete renovation by Kraemer Design Group with the Detroit Beer Co. in mind; the building also has mixed-use functions. The Kraemer Design Group planned a brewery and pub in the basement, first and second floor, loft offices on the third, fourth and fifth, and finally a loft apartment on the sixth floor. While the renovations updated the building to fit the current surrounding locale, the historic character of the building was preserved and it is being considered for a listing on the National Register of Historic places. Front of Hartz Building The Beer Detroit Beer Co. has an extensive selection of award winning ales and lagers that are brewed on-site. The brewhouse was constructed to fit the space requirements of the historic Hartz building; the basement houses four fermentation tanks. The design of the brewhouse, along with the sophisticated beer delivery system, permits the brewery to offer up to 8 house beers on tap at any time. The brewmaster, Kevin Rodger, oversees the brewery operation. Detroit Beer Co. has seven beers offered year round: Broadway Light, Detroit Lager, Detroit Red, Local 1529 IPA, and The Detroit Dwarf (named after the \\"Nain Rouge\\" dwarf who haunts the city and serves as a harbinger of doom), The People Mover Porter (named after Detroit's downtown public transportation system) and Steam Tunnel Stout.Midwest Microbrews - Detroit Beer Co.  Awards  The company's first award was won at the first annual Michigan Brewers Olympics in 2004. It is still on display behind the bar, even though nobody knows what it is anymore (it's the one with the king, holding a scepter and flanked by roller skates). Events included a race where contestants picked up a 55-pound bag of grain and ran 15 yards to a pallet and stacked it, 20 times, and then had to slam a can of Stroh's, a Keg toss, a quiz, and, finally, an obstacle course. At the Great American Beer Festival, the Detroit Dwarf took the bronze in the category of \\"Beer with Yeast\\" in 2004 and gold in the category \\"D√ºsseldorf Alt\\" in 2008. The Detroit Lager won bronze for \\"Bohemian Pilsener\\" in 2007. The Detroit Dwarf also took home the silver medal for \\"D√ºsseldorf Alt\\" at the World Beer Cup in 2010. At the World Expo of Beer, Lager holds a gold medal once again for \\"Bohemian Pilsener\\". A since discontinued brew, St. Brigid's Oatmeal Stout was awarded the gold for \\"Oatmeal Stout\\" at the Michigan Beer Cup in 2004. Le Nain Rouge The famed Detroit Dwarf actually has some historical significance. Its mascot, the Nain Rouge (French for \\"Red Dwarf\\") has been known as the mythical demon responsible for all of the hardships that have befallen the city of Detroit over the decades. The brew was given its namesake for the \\"devilish\\" hops flavor balanced by a red malty undertone, each characteristic of a German Alt- style beer.

History  8tracks Founder David Porter claims his idea for a \\"music- oriented social network\\" has been in development since 1999 during his time in business school at Berkeley, but it was not founded until 2006 and the app was not launched until August 2008. One of Porter's major influences for the project was Napster, more specifically its \\"Hotlist\\" feature, which allowed users to add other users to their \\"hot list,\\" consequently giving them access to that user's entire library. Also, after having spent 3 years prior to business school in London, Porter was fascinated by the social nature of the city's electronic music scene in which DJ's gained cult-like followings and augmented their following primarily through peer referral. Based on these concepts, Porter drafted a business plan entitled \\"Sampled & Sorted,\\" which is now the name of his blog and was able to garner some initial attention for the project from venture capital firms. However, given his relative inexperience in the business world, Porter joined Live365, gained an understanding of their business model, their strengths and weaknesses, and was able to refine his original proposition. With the rise of Web 2.0, Porter finally decided to found 8tracks in Fall 2006, and after compiling a preliminary team, was able to launch the site on August 8, 2008. In November 2011, 8tracks made its debut in the Android Market, launching with more than 300,000 mixes. An Android 2.1 or higher device is required in order to use the app, but Market stats reveal more than 10,000 downloads within days of release. Between 2011 and 2015, there was also a list of tracks from SoundCloud provided by 8tracks for DJs to add to their mix. In April 2013, 8tracks made its debut in the Windows 8 App Store. Any Windows 8 Pro or RT device including desktop PCs and tablets were able to access the app. In early 2016, 8tracks was required to stop offering streaming music via its app outside of the United States and Canada, and instead started to use YouTube videos. While initially 8tracks did have commercial interruption during playlists, they adopted them in 2018 to remove their listening cap. Users were able to bypass these ads by buying a subscription service, 8tracks plus. The cost was $25 for a six-month subscription. On 26 December 2019, 8tracks announced in a blog post that they intended to cease operations at the end of the year due to lack of revenue and a lack of interest in their purchase by any larger company. By this time, there were less than 1 million monthly users, down from over 8 million in 2014. However, on 19 April 2020 8tracks relauched under the new ownership and operation of BackBeat Inc. Website and App Usage  Listeners were able to search through existing playlists of songs as well as create their own playlists. The songs in the playlist were revealed one at a time, and listeners were able to skip three songs per playlist before they were able to \\"skip\\" onto a different mix, where their three skips were restored. Individual songs within a playlist each featured a direct link to iTunes should the user wish to purchase that song. Users were able to \\"like\\" entire mixes or \\"star\\" individual tracks within them in order to facilitate quick access in the future, and could also \\"follow\\" other users, effectively subscribing to the mixes they created. Users also could embed the mixes they created and share them through social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr. 8tracks also had the ability to reverse sync with these social networking sites to allow users to easily find their \\"friends\\" and expand their network. Anyone could upload a playlist to become a \\"DJ\\" on 8tracks. Mixes needed to include a minimum of eight songs, uploaded from the user's personal music library or directly accessed from the 8tracks library. The site also required its users to add titles, images, descriptions, and at least 2 tags when creating a playlist. When a DJ uploaded songs to the site, they appeared in a list next to where the mix is created. Users searched for mixes by individual artist, specific genre, or by utilizing the \\"cloud\\" feature that sorts mixes by tags (i.e. \\"autumn\\", \\"love\\", \\"sad\\", \\"eclectic\\"). DJs also had the option to mark mixes as unlisted, which made them private, or not safe for work (NSFW), which hid them from users who opted into a filter. 8tracks had an official Android, iPhone, Windows 8.x, Xbox 360 and Mac app, as well as several unofficial third party apps. The Mix Feed gave users a stream of all their favorite tracks, allowed them to search for any artist of interest, or find mixes that include them. 8tracks' development stack was built using Ruby on Rails running on Amazon AWS. For datastores, MySQL (on Amazon RDS) was used. Other database systems used include: Redis, Solr, MongoDB, and Graphite. 8tracks also allowed other developers to use it, and hosted a forum to allow them to ask questions to staff. By requesting for a unique artist tag, Artists were able to promote their music on 8tracks with a special account. They were able to create mixes with a combination of their own and others' music, or to post full albums via a content-owner account. By using 8tracks to promote their music, fans were able to interact with artists. Notable artists who used 8tracks to promote their music include: Metric, Bassnectar, Carolina Liar, and B.o.B.8Tracks: Artists. Partnerships and Corporate Connections  8tracks attempted to reach profitability by partnering with brands looking to open channels of communication with potential consumers through \\"music-centric interactive marketing\\" campaigns. For instance, apparel store/community Threadless partnered with 8tracks to host a monthly contest in which Threadless' warehouse crew judges playlists and the curator of their favorite mix wins a $50 gift certificate. To promote their new, retro Piiq headphones, Sony ran a contest in conjunction with fashion website Lookbook where users created mixes representative of \\"A Day in the Life (of You)\\" and those with the most likes won fashion and/or music-related prizes. Rolling Stone also added an interactive element to the release of its yearly \\"Playlist Issue\\" by compiling genre-specific celebrity- and artist-curated playlists that were hosted through the magazine's 8tracks user page and also embedded on the Rolling Stone website. This integrated media approach was significant in that it allowed otherwise heavily copyrighted music to be streamed legally. Notable curators included Tom Petty, Elton John, Art Garfunkel, Coldplay's Chris Martin, and Metallica's Lars Ulrich. Finally, California hotel chain Joie de Vivre and its partners offered a variety of prizes to DJs who published and generated the most likes on mixes driven by the theme of \\"California road trip\\" in order to drive brand awareness during the peak summer travel season. 8tracks partnered with Feature.fm to offer artists the ability to play their songs as \\"sponsored tracks\\" to people who are listening to playlists of the artist's style of music. 8tracks paid royalties to SoundExchange, and ultimately their push for back royalties led to the closure in 2019.

Poem Interpretations While it is not long, many different interpretations exist for this poem. Many think that this poem stands for one's reflection on their past life. The poem questions whether you valued your life over death or, worse, never having been born. Did you in fact see life for all of its beauty or do you view your life as a waste? The poem asks you to analyze your life, to question whether every decision you made was for the greater good, and to learn and accept the decisions you have made in your life. One Answer to the Question would be simply to value the fact that you had the opportunity to live. Another interpretation is that the poem gives a deep image of suffering. It portrays the fact that we live in suffering, and there is nothing we can do about it. Then the poem relays the question as to why we bear the unhappiness that is life, which makes readers think that Frost was heavily intrigued and curious about the \\"why.\\" There is also a Christian interpretation, in which God proposes the titular Question to his followers, the \\"men of the earth\\". He asks whether all the suffering and pain we go through during our lives is worth the gift of life. A similar Christian interpretation would also be that the \\"soul-and-body\\" scars represent the wounds of Christ, and thus the poem is asking whether humanity has proven itself worthy of such redemption.

The cape was named by Captain John Moresby in 1874 commanding after Lord Horatio Nelson. Cape Nelson lies on the northern extremity of a peninsula with a coast broken by narrow fjord like inlets and Mount Victory, an active volcano with a height of , as its highest feature with the cape itself composed of grassy slopes rising to mountains with a fringing reef and numerous off shore reefs. The Hall Point light (9¬∞03'S., 149¬∞18'E.) lies about southeast of the cape. The waters between Cape Nelson and Cape Ward Hunt, lying about to the north-west, are described as being: > of the most dangerous character, due to the unsurveyed areas and the > numerous coral patches and shoals. The coral patches are steep-to and the > sea seldom breaks on them. The weather is often thick with passing squalls > of rain, and anchorages are rare close to land. Between coral patches only a > few miles apart, a sounding of several hundred meters may be obtained. During World War II finding a route for supply by sea from Milne Bay to Cape Nelson through the Ward Hunt Strait past Cape Vogel and then through Collingwood Bay in support of the operation to take Buna was of critical importance as the Japanese control of open sea approaches to the north required ships to pass in the dangerous and almost uncharted inshore waters approaching Cape Nelson and it was only after difficult survey efforts that larger ships were able to supply that campaign. That work was first done by luggers and small ships joined later by in surveying, installing lights, landing shore parties for reconnaissance, establishing radio stations and piloting ships through the discovered channels.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 11, 2012. In the episode, a traumatic incident causes Homer to repeatedly wet the bed. As it worsens, his family, with the help of Professor Frink, successfully manage to infiltrate his dreams to get to its subconscious source. The episode name is a pun on How I Met Your Mother. The episode was co-written by Billy Kimball and Ian Maxtone-Graham and has received positive reviews from critics.  Plot  Mr. Smithers enters a storage cupboard in the power plant and accidentally leaves the door open. Homer, seeing this as an opportunity to steal supplies, tells everyone to come and help themselves and every employee steals something. However, Homer then sees Mr. Burns approaching and hurries away from the plant, leaving his fellow employees to get all of the blame. Homer is thought to be the only one who did not steal anything and gets a day off, which he spends going fishing with Bart. The next night, Homer wets the bed while asleep. When he wets the bed again the following night, he thinks that karma may be the reason, so he apologizes to all of his fellow employees with a free barbecue for everyone. That night, Homer wets the bed again and gets angry over a wasted act of kindness. He buys a bedwetting alarm that will warn him when he is about to urinate in his sleep. This machine, however, wakes up the entire family and he must explain his predicament to them. Homer then starts wearing Confidence Man Adult Diapers which are a turn-off to Marge, and she goes for a walk. She bumps into Professor Frink, who reveals that he has invented a machine that can be used to enter other people's dreams. They plug in Homer while he is asleep and the family enters his dream in which he is skiing down a snowy mountain. There, they meet Death, who is dragging a coffin that reads \\"Marriage\\". After falling off a cliff while pursuing Death, and faced with Frink's warning that their death in the dream world could kill them in real life, they use the dream machine to enter Bart's dream to prolong their time. In this dream, the family is drawn in their original style from The Tracey Ullman Show (which aired on Fox's television stations in 1987, after News Corporation's acquisition of the Metromedia stations in 1986), with Homer using his original Walter Matthau- style voice. Family therapist B.F. Sherwood tells them to open the coffin. When it is opened, the room starts to fill with fish, so the family use the machine to go to the next dream, which is Lisa's, but when they find that they are on an Elizabethan stage show, they immediately change dreams again, much to Lisa's protests of being ignored, going back into Homer's. Homer's newest dream depicts a city made of his greatest desires. After exploring the dream, Homer decides he wants to stay in it forever. At this point, Chief Wiggum, Eddie, and Lou have entered the Simpsons' home to try to get the dream machine from Professor Frink, ignoring his warnings that this could kill the Simpsons. In the resulting fight, the dream machine falls to the floor, which causes a disturbance in the dream, in which a large bottle of Duff Beer falls over and floods the city. The Simpsons are nearly crushed by two large gears, but they are rescued by Death, who is revealed to be Mona Simpson, Homer's late mother. Mona then takes the family to a movie theater where they view a childhood memory of Homer's. He and Grampa went on a fishing trip and the boat capsized. They then returned to their holiday home several hours late and without any fish. A couple of weeks following the incident, Mona left Grampa and Homer. This left Homer guilty as he thought that the failed fishing trip caused his mother to leave. However, Mona reassures him that it was not because of this and shows another memory of her being relieved that Homer, her greatest treasure, was safe because of Grampa, and Homer finally feels comfort. Now knowing the reason behind Homer's bed-wetting, the family leaves the dream before it collapses on itself. Back at the Simpson home, Chief Wiggum finally manages to get the device from Frink and detaches it just as everyone wakes up. Homer is relieved to find he has not wet himself. That night, Homer spins a top, with Marge telling him that if it keeps spinning, they are still in a dream. It does so they decide to strip naked and go for a bike ride. However, as soon as they leave, the top falls on its side and it starts to hail. A truck then hits Homer. Behind the end credits, David Byrne and Glenn Close sing a version of \\"Dream Operator\\" from the David Byrne movie \\"True Stories\\". Production \\"How I Wet Your Mother\\" is written by Billy Kimball and Ian Maxtone-Graham and was directed by Lance Kramer. The title of the episode is a reference to the TV show, How I Met Your Mother. The plot spoofs the film Inception, with various scenes parodying certain moments from the film. The episode is also the fourth to feature the character of Mona Simpson, who had previously died in \\"Mona Leaves-a\\". The name of character B.F. Sherwood is a parody of American psychologist B.F. Skinner. Reception The episode is the third least watched episode in the history of The Simpsons, having only 4.97 million viewers in the United States. It was the second most watched program on FOX that night,. Hayden Childs, of The A.V. Club, was positive on the episode noting that \\"Although it never reaches outright hilarity, ‚ÄòHow I Wet Your Mother‚Äô is one of the more interesting episodes of this season.\\" He further noted that only having one major plot was a good idea and several good jokes in the episode.

In the episode, the Simpsons discover that the inhabitants of Springfield have grown tired of them and have secretly decided to throw them out of the city. After being evicted from Springfield, the family members end up in a rugged place without rules and regulations called The Outlands. There, they briefly come across their neighbor Julian Assange, who created WikiLeaks. Assange guest-starred in the episode as himself and recorded his lines over the phone while under house arrest in Britain, while waiting for the results of Assange v Swedish Prosecution Authority. Michael Price wrote \\"At Long Last Leave\\" without the intention of it becoming the 500th episode and felt honored when it was selected for the milestone. Television critics have given the episode generally positive reviews, particularly praising it for a montage of the series' couch gags that was included in the opening sequence. The storyline of \\"At Long Last Leave\\" has, however, received criticism for being similar to stories previously done on The Simpsons and in The Simpsons Movie. During its original airing on the Fox network in the United States on February 19, 2012, the episode was watched by about 5.77 million people and received a in the demographic for adults aged 18‚Äì49. Before this broadcast, Fox promoted the 500th episode milestone by arranging an attempt to break the Guinness World Record for longest continuous television viewing. A hundred fans of The Simpsons were invited to watch a marathon of the series' episodes, starting on February 8, 2012. The record was broken 86 hours and 37 minutes later on February 12, 2012, with only two fans left watching the marathon. Plot The Simpson family is advised of a citywide nuclear safety drill and all the inhabitants of Springfield are told to stay in their basements for three hours. The family members quickly become bored in the basement and decide to leave the house and go see the empty city. As they walk through Springfield, they see an unusual number of cars parked by the City Hall. The Simpsons go in and discover that everyone in town has gathered for a secret town meeting and have voted unanimously to kick them out of Springfield forever. Mayor Quimby reveals that the city has gone bankrupt due to the constant cleaning up of the family's shenanigans over the years, ranging from Homer's drunken antics, Bart's various pranks, and Lisa's environmental concerns. Marge delivers a heart-felt plea to the residents to let the Simpsons live in the one place they call home, but they refuse, with Quimby declaring her the \\"worst Simpson\\" for always trying to see the family in a positive light. Ned attempts to defend the Simpsons by claiming that Quimby's own corruption is the main reason the town is bankrupt. Quimby decides to throw him out of the meeting in response. A big celebration is held by the city's population as the Simpsons are officially evicted from Springfield, which Ned and his family refuses to attend. When the family drives out into the middle of nowhere at night with no place to stay, they come across a man who takes them to a county called The Outlands, which is a dirty, run-down place where there are no rules and regulations. The Simpsons settle in The Outlands and meet Julian Assange‚Äîtheir unfriendly next-door neighbor who operates the WikiLeaks Headquarters there. While the rest of the family gets used to their new home, Marge struggles with her new life. When they confront her about it, the family realize that Marge is just homesick for Springfield and misses their former neighbors. Despite Bart's warning to stay away from Springfield, Homer sneaks her back there one night under the disguise of Mr. Burns and Smithers, and they spend the night getting drunk and subsequently having drunken sex in their old abandoned home. However, Chief Wiggum sees through their disguises, and rallies the people of Springfield to the Simpson home to capture Homer and Marge. Homer is extremely angered by this and furiously insults the residents for being jerks to them in not allowing them to see their former town. The citizens are offended by his crude nature and order for the police to shoot him in response to him insulting their town, but Marge stuns the citizens by saying to not bother doing so because she has something she would like to tell the town before she and Homer leave. Shocked by her newfound assertive personality, Wiggum, Eddie and Lou immediately lower their guns. Marge reprimands the townsfolk in Springfield for their behavior in hating her family for being who they are and exploring their interests, stating that she and Homer came back to visit their old home here because she was homesick, only to see just how disillusioned and judgmental the residents of Springfield are in not allowing her family any decency to be themselves. She announces that the residents exiling her family out of town is the best thing that happened to them, and she'd rather return to the Outlands with her loving family because they found a place to live and a new community who accepts them for who they are. She also claims the Outlands' townsfolk are much better as a community because they encourage the Simpsons to be themselves and to explore their interest without worry of hate, judgment and resentment from others. As Marge and Homer march through the visibly disillusioned crowd and return to The Outlands, the citizens regret exiling the Simpsons and realize they must do something to win them back. Back in the Simpsons' new home, Marge is settling in well and happily plants her new garden. Bart and Maggie discover Lenny and Carl sneaking in and attack them. They tell the family they long to start a new life in The Outlands after hearing Homer and Marge out. Soon, Moe appears and opens Moe's Cavern, which Homer, Lenny and Carl patronize. Mayor Quimby, and many other Springfield residents show up, wishing to abandon their lives in Springfield and start over in The Outlands. Soon, all of Springfield moves there to start new lives with the Simpsons, and they begin rebuilding a new city which Quimby names Springfield. This is against Marge's wishes, admitting she has always disliked the corruption there and the man who befriended the Simpsons leaves. Principal Skinner is left alone in the old Springfield until Bart picks him up via a helicopter. Production Julian Assange, the founder of website WikiLeaks, appeared in the episode. \\"At Long Last Leave\\", which is the 500th episode of The Simpsons, was written by Michael Price. The Simpsons' showrunner Al Jean has described it as \\"a tribute to people who love the show.\\" Being a fan of musical theater, Price titled the episode in reference to the Cole Porter song \\"At Long Last Love\\". Price did not write \\"At Long Last Leave\\" with the intention of it becoming the 500th episode; that decision was made afterwards when the staff members realized the story offered an opportunity for a look- back at the history of the Simpson family. He said in an interview with the magazine Channel Guide that he was \\"deeply honored\\" when his episode was selected for the milestone. As acknowledged by Price in that interview, the plot of the episode features similarities to the 2007 film The Simpsons Movie, in which the Simpsons are forced to flee to Alaska after Homer angers the townspeople in Springfield by polluting a lake. However, Price commented that \\"I think it's different from the movie in that it sort of does reference back the entire history of the show, the collective experience of Springfield vis- a-vis the Simpsons, whereas the movie they were forced to run away due to that very specific thing\\". He further noted that despite the similarities \\"we [the staff] liked it enough to go with it anyway.\\" The plot was first announced to the press at the Comic-Con convention in San Diego, California on July 23, 2011, during a panel with the cast and crew of The Simpsons. The episode features several guest appearances, with Kelsey Grammer and Jackie Mason returning for short cameos as Sideshow Bob and Rabbi Krustofski, respectively. American musician Alison Krauss and her band Union Station recorded a bluegrass version of the Simpsons theme song that is played in the episode and over the closing credits. Australian activist Julian Assange‚Äîthe founder of WikiLeaks‚Äîappeared as himself. Many of his lines were written by Australian author Kathy Lette, who is one of Assange's friends. According to Lette, \\"Julian and The Simpsons producers asked me to rewrite his scene and dialogue. I guess they just wanted me to add a little Aussie irony to the script. Julian does not suffer from an irony deficiency! I used to write a sitcom for Columbia Pictures, the long-running series The Facts of Life, so the producers knew I could fire off a quip or two.\\" In 2010, Swedish authorities issued a European Arrest Warrant to extradite Assange from Britain to Sweden for questioning in relation to sexual assault allegations made against him there. Assange was arrested in England, before being freed on conditional bail until a decision would be made as to whether or not he should be extradited to Sweden. Assange recorded his lines over the phone while under house arrest in England. Jean, who directed Assange's performance from Los Angeles, only acquired a phone number to call and received no information about the whereabouts of the activist. According to Jean in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, The Simpsons creator Matt Groening had found out through a rumor that Assange wanted to appear on the show. Casting director Bonnie Pietila was therefore given the task to contact Assange and make sure the guest appearance could happen. The episode features no reference to Assange's legal situation at the time of his recording. Jean commented that he is \\"a controversial figure, and there's a good reason he's controversial. There was discussion internally whether or not to have him on the show, but ultimately we went ahead and did it.\\" Groening has said in an interview that \\"We [the staff] dare ourselves to do things and Julian Assange was a dare.\\" Promotion Hollywood & Highland. To promote the 500th episode milestone, the Fox network, which airs The Simpsons, attempted to break the Guinness World Record for longest continuous television viewing by arranging a marathon screening of the show's episodes at Hollywood & Highland. The record of 86 hours, six minutes, and 41 seconds was set in 2010 when three people watched all episodes of the Fox show 24. A hundred fans were selected to participate in the Simpsons marathon, which was also a contest to determine which fan could last the longest into the marathon. The screening started on February 8, 2012 with \\"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\\", the first episode of the series, and ended on February 12 of that same year with \\"Faith Off,\\" the eleventh episode of the eleventh season. At that point, 86 hours and 37 minutes had passed, which meant the record was broken. The two remaining viewers‚ÄîJeremiah Franco and Carin Shreve‚Äîwere crowned joint winners of the contest and each won US $10,500. They also got to attend the 500th Episode Celebration party held on February 13, 2012 for the cast and crew of The Simpsons. Reception The episode was originally broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on February 19, 2012. It was watched by approximately 5.77 million people during this broadcast, and in the demographic for adults aged 18‚Äì49, it received a 2.6 Nielsen rating and a seven percent share. The rating was a thirty percent increase from the previous episode, \\"The Daughter Also Rises\\". \\"At Long Last Leave\\" became the most-watched broadcast in Fox's Animation Domination lineup for the night in terms of total viewers. It also became the second highest-rated broadcast among adults aged 18‚Äì49. \\"At Long Last Leave\\" has received generally positive reviews from television critics, particularly for its couch gag in the Simpsons opening sequence. This couch gag features a frame-by-frame montage of previous couch gags that pulls back into a photomosaic of the number \\"500\\". The A.V. Club critic Hayden Childs wrote that the \\"best thing about the 500th Simpsons episode is the opening couch montage, which hits the nostalgia bullseye almost perfectly.\\" HitFix's Alan Sepinwall praised the couch gag as being \\"marvelous\\", noting that it \\"actually made me choke up a bit.\\" Sepinwall commended \\"At Long Last Leave\\", commenting that \\"like many latter-day Simpsons outings, [it] features a story we've seen variations on several times before (including in The Simpsons Movie), but also features many funny jokes that affirm my belief that I'm happier to live in a world that keeps giving us new Simpsons episodes [...] than I will be in the one where that inevitably stops.\\" Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: \\"I got a few laughs and that's all I ever look for in The Simpsons these days. I just like knowing it's still there. [...] It doesn't have the spring in the legs quite like it used to. It's not going to dazzle at the same spectacular rate. But even after 500 episodes, it still has a little something left.\\" Goodman described the couch gag as \\"lovely\\". Matt Roush of TV Guide wrote favorably about \\"At Long Last Leave\\", describing it as a \\"keeper\\" and highlighting the \\"dazzling opening sequence\\". He concluded that The Simpsons \\"once again delivers the goods, proving itself to be a classic for our age and for the ages.\\" Childs was less positive, writing that the episode is \\"nothing special\\" as \\"all of the elements seem drawn from earlier stories\\" and \\"only a few of the jokes rise to the lowered bar of latter-day Simpsons humor.\\" He added, however, that \\"nothing in the episode goes outrageously wrong, either. There is little Family Guy-style stupidity and randomness, the satire is gently pointed inward, and the guest star, while splashy for his controversiality, does not hijack the plot‚Äîinstead appearing for a single joke before vanishing.\\" TIME critic James Poniewozik commented that \\"At Long Last Leave\\" was an \\"all right\\" episode, noting that certain gags felt \\"forced by the writers‚Äô room\\". He added however that \\"a few moments made me bark out loud and realize why I loved the show in the first place.\\" References External links *\\"At Long Last Leave\\" at TheSimpsons.com * *\\"At Long Last Leave\\" at TV.com Category:The Simpsons (season 23) episodes Category:2012 American television episodes Category:Julian Assange Category:Cultural depictions of Julian Assange ","title":"At Long Last Leave"},{"id":"33169788","title":"In the Morning (J.

Olea was employed at DWEB-FM in Nabua, Camarines Sur, where he hosted his daily broadcast ‚ÄúAnything Goes,‚Äù on which he had been known to provide commentary on politics and current affairs, as well as discussing accusations of corruption. While it remains unclear as to who committed the crime, senior police official, Victor Deona, said it was possible Olea‚Äôs murder could have been related to his work. The motive for Olea‚Äôs murder remains unconfirmed.  Context  In 2011, the Committee to Protect Journalists ranked the Philippines third on its Impunity Index, regarding it as one of the worst countries not only in terms of the number of journalists murdered regularly, but also by the ability of the government to solve the related crimes. Iraq was ranked first and Somalia, second. On July 9, 2010, part-time radio-announcer, Miguel Belena, sustained seven gunshots from two motorcycle-riding attackers on his way home; he died a month later at a local hospital. The motorcycle assailants who killed Belena have since been identified as Eric Vargas, and Gina Bagacina, an alleged member of the New People‚Äôs Army (NPA). Olea‚Äôs murderers have yet to be identified. Olea‚Äôs wife, Raquel, said in an interview with Agence-France Presse, that her husband had, on occasion, received death threats. One of Olea‚Äôs co-workers at DWEB, Benny Decena, informed the Inquirer that Olea told him, prior to the murder, he had been receiving text messages containing threats.Escandor Jr., Juan. 2011. ‚ÄúSlain broadcaster laid to rest.‚Äù Inquirer News, June 18. Retrieved September 14, 2011 . It remains unclear as to who the messages came from, or what information they actually contained. Decena also said Olea had a premonition regarding his possible fate, which caused him to start carrying a gun. According to DWEB‚Äôs acting assistant manager, Jing Florece, Olea had been discussing issues regarding a well-known political clan in Iriga, the Alfelor family, on his broadcast. Florece added that, most recently, Olea had been addressing a particular incident that occurred during a basketball tournament in the city; moreover, he said Olea came across a video clip from the game which captured a heated exchange between an unknown person and the mayor of Iriga City, Madelaine Alfelor Gazmen. It has been reported Gazmen ordered the game to be stopped as her favorite team was losing, which resulted in a fight between the teams. In July 2009, Miguel Belen, a commentator for DWEB was killed.  Impact  An active group of Filipino free press advocates, the Burgos Media Center, named in memory of Joe Burgos, a press freedom-fighter, stated that it will implement a program in an effort to better inform students about the issues surrounding free press. The center‚Äôs spokesman, Marc Joseph Alejo, said the purpose of the plan is to challenge the Aquino administration to make the Philippines safer for journalists. At the same time, the group admonished the government for the lack of progress regarding the passing of the Freedom of Information Bill, an initiative to fight corruption through allowing citizens to access crucial public records, a cause Olea had been devoted to during his life.  Reactions  Reporters Without Borders offered the following statements, ‚ÄúWe extend our condolences to Olea‚Äôs family and friends.‚Äù ‚ÄúHis murder is another tragic example of the complete lack of security for media workers in the Philippines and shows that the ‚Äòsuper body‚Äô that the justice minister created last year to reinforce efforts to combat violence against journalists has been insufficient.‚Äù Herminio R.

In 2003, an International Labour Organization (ILO) survey reported that one in every ten children in the capital above the age of seven was engaged in child domestic labour. Children who are too young to work in the fields work as scavengers. They spend their days rummaging in dumps looking for items that can be sold for money. Children also often work in the garment and textile industry, in prostitution, and in the military. In Cambodia, the state had ratified both the Minimum Age Convention (C138) in 1999 and Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention (C182) in 2006, which are adopted by the International Labour Organization (ILO). For the former convention, Cambodia had specified the minimum age to work to be at age 14. Yet, significant levels of child labour appear to be found in Cambodia. In 1998, ILO estimated that 24.1% of children in Cambodia aged between 10 and 14 were economically active.World Development Indicators 2000 Many of these children work long hours and Cambodia Human Development Report 2000 reported that approximately 65,000 children between the ages of 5 to 13 worked 25 hours a week and did not attend school.Cambodia Human Development Report 2000 There are also many initiative and policies put in place to decrease the prevalence of child labour such as the United States generalized system of preferences, the U.S.-Cambodia textile agreement, ILO Garment Sector Working Conditions Improvement Project, and ChildWise Tourism. There is a need to eliminate child labour in Cambodia as a report by UNICEF states that child labourers could be missing out on education. When children do not attend school, they are denied the knowledge and skills needed for national development. Without education and vital life skills, they are vulnerable to abuse and exploitation, which may exacerbate the existing cycle of poverty in their families. Consequently, this lack in productivity due to lack of education will hold back economic growth in Cambodia.  Definition of Child Labour  The International Labour Organization (ILO) defines child labour as work that deprives them of their childhood, potential, and dignity. They also define it as work that is harmful to their physical and mental health. This includes work that disrupts their schooling, but does not include work such as working in the home or in a family business. They define the worst forms of child labour as work that involves slavery, conscription for the military, prostitution, trafficking of drugs, and any work that is harmful to the health and safety of the children. UNICEF defines child labour as children between 5 and 14 years old who do domestic work and economic activity. = Minimum age convention, 1973 = The ILO created the ‚ÄúMinimum Age Convention‚Äù, which was ratified by Cambodia in 1999. The purpose of this convention was to determine the minimum age permissible for employment, with the larger goal of eradicating child labour. They define the minimum age of employment at fifteen years old, except in countries with poorly developed economies and educational facilities. In such countries the minimum age of employment is fourteen years old. For work that harms a child's health, safety, or morals, the minimum age is eighteen years old. = Worst forms of child labour convention, 1999 = The ILO created the ‚ÄúWorst Forms of Child Labour Convention‚Äù, which was ratified by Cambodia in 2006. The purpose of this convention was to prohibit and eliminate the worst forms of child labour, with children being people under the age of 18. This convention required all members to create programs to eliminate child labour, monitor these programs, and provide education to the children removed from the worst forms of child labour. They also require that each country recognize that girls and boys have different experiences with child labour.  Industries  Child working in Siem Reap, Cambodia = Agriculture = In a study by Edmonds in 2001, 73% of economically active Cambodian children worked in the agricultural sector. The United States Department of Labour reported some of the tasks the children have to do in the agricultural sector. These include fishing, peeling shrimp, shucking crabs, producing tobacco, spraying pesticides, and logging for timber. The Bureau of International Labour Affairs reports that as of 2015 Cambodia's Ministry of Labour and Vocational Training has regulations for children working the agricultural industry, but has not begun enforcing them. = Garments and Textiles = Two-thirds of Cambodia's workforce is in the garment industry. In the 1990s Cambodia was not a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), therefore it was not subject to quota limits on exports. This led to an increase in foreign investment in Cambodia's garment industry. In 1998, the media exposed a Nike supply factory utilizing child labour. This led to the creation of the U.S-Cambodia Textile Agreement. Even with this policy there is still evidence of child labour in the Cambodian garment sector as of 2004. = Prostitution = Prostitution of any kind is prohibited in Cambodia, but is tolerated. Cambodian children are often prostituted in the sex tourism industry. In a study by Willis, there were 5950 children involved in prostitution in Cambodia in 1999. Young virgin girls are especially sought after, and some men have justified this by saying that it is the best way to avoid contracting AIDS. Prostitution has significant effects on the mental health and physical health of children. In a study in Cambodia, all the women and girls in the study had been \\"victimised and felt helpless, damaged, degraded, betrayed, and shamed. Many of the young women reported depression, hopelessness, inability to sleep, nightmares, poor appetite, and a sense of resignation\\". In the same study Willis found that prostituted children have higher rates of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) than non-prostituted children in many countries. The STD rate of prostituted adolescents in Cambodia is 36% while the STD rate of adolescents worldwide is 5%. Child prostitutes also have higher STD rates than adult prostitutes because they have less power to ask for condoms. The United Nations conducted field visits in Cambodia and found that \\"60 to 70 per cent of the child victims of prostitution are HIV positive\\". Children from other countries such as Vietnam are also being trafficked to become prostitutes in Cambodia. In fact, a study by Hughes reported that \\"one-third of the 55,000 women in prostitution in Cambodia were under age 18 and most were Vietnamese\\". Many studies have found that as of 1995, there are still numerous prostitutes in Cambodia under the age of eighteen. The sexual exploitation of children has increased due to the commercialization of the internet because it offered privacy and had few regulations. = Military Use of Children = Children get conscripted by the military due to being bystanders and targets of conflict. Armed conflict poses serious threats to the health and safety of children. The United Nations has reported that children have been seen playing with landmines and unexploded ordnance. The study by the UN also found that forty-three percent of mine explosion victims in military hospitals were conscripted when they were between ten and sixteen years old. The health effects of such mine explosions are extremely severe, especially for children. The UN study reported that twenty percent of children involved in mine and unexploded ordnance die due to their injuries. The children who survive often receive amputations and suffer complications from these amputations, which can also lead to financial disaster for the family. Causes of child labour in Cambodia File:Child Labour in Cambodia.jpgChild fishing in Tonl√© Sap, Cambodia File:Tonle Sap Siem Reap Cambodia Girl-begging-for-money-with-snake-01.jpgA little girl making money for her family by posing with a snake in a water village of Tonle Sap Lake = Economic growth = It is believed that Cambodia's economic growth and progress is a contributing factor to the increasing number of child labourers. The huge demands of the construction industry is one example where it has pushed children to work in factories or brick kilns, foreclosing the option of school education for most of them. = Tourism =  Street peddlers  Others spend their days in the streets peddling. Tourists play a key role in this form of child labour as many are willing to buy from these children, out of good intentions, escalating demands. This reinforces the notion that children are more valuable in the streets than at school. However, there are also arguments that it might be better to buy from child sellers or they might be forced to work in even more hazardous activities.  Sex tourism  Children are often sought from impoverished areas are often brought to entertainment and tourism areas, to work in the red light district. Most of these prostitutes start their job between ten and sixteen years old. When interviewed, child sex tourists report that they prefer to have sex with virgins because it is safer. Sex tourists go to Cambodia because the brothels are cheap and the price of a virgin in Cambodia is much lower than those in nearby countries and the United States. Child sex tourism is a violation of the UN Convention of the Rights of a Child, and of the Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography. = Poverty = Child labour was mutually reinforced by poverty and underdevelopment, however they are not the primary causes. A study by Kim reports that wealth and child labour are actually positively associated, because wealthy families have assets like land. They say that this finding poses problems for policy makers because a majority of them believe that all children who work are poor. Since policy makers in Cambodia believe that poverty is the major cause of child labour they focus their efforts on reducing poverty rather than targeting child labour directly. Kim's study finds that poverty and child labour are not as closely linked as was previously thought, which would mean that the efforts of the policy makers are not as effective as possible.  Effects of child labour in Cambodia  A common ramification of child labour is denied access to basic services, namely education and healthcare. The Children's Rights Department of the Cambodian League for Promotion and Defense of Human Rights (LICADHO) survey showed that out of 400 children aged 5 to 17 who worked as garbage dump scavengers only 35% went to school. The economic and societal impacts are far reaching, hence raising awareness and efforts to prohibit child labour are important. = Education effects = In 2005, Cambodia had a very high primary school enrollment rate of 95.1 percent, but the primary school completion rate was only 46.8 percent. Secondary school completion was even lower with a rate of 25.7 percent. At the same time 52 percent of 7- to 14-year-old children were economically active. A study by Kim (2011) reports that most employed children in Cambodia are enrolled in school but their employment is associated with late school entry, negative impacts on their learning outcomes, and increased drop out rates. These associations are stronger with girls. Boys tend to be more involved in economic activities, but girls tend to have lower school enrollment rates. Currently, there are no educational policies to address the significant impact that child labour has on educational outcomes in Cambodia. Child labour has short term positive economic effects because the children are bringing in more money for their families, but the long term economic effects are negative due to the lack of schooling. = Health effects = One of the definitions of child labour by the ILO is work that negatively impacts a child's health. Child labourers have been found to suffer from health problems. For instance, carrying excessive loads may cause stunt development. There is the possibility of child scavengers made injured by sharp, contaminated objects or moving traffic. Other problems include long hours of work, respiratory and skin diseases, life-threatening tetanus, joint and bone deformities. A study by Roggero found that child labour negatively affects the health of the children and that child labour was a significant predictor of undernourishment. They also found that in regions with a high prevalence of child labour, childhood morbidity associated with HIV/AIDS, non-HIV infectious diseases, and malaria was largely correlated with child labour. They concluded these results by saying that they suggest that countries with high levels of child labour have low health status. A study by Miwa Kana in 2010 found that child labour actually improved the health and nutritional status when the number of hours is within a threshold level. The same study found that the oldest children in the study who worked the longest hours still worked below this threshold. Note that in this study took place in the rice-growing area of Cambodia and that the extent of child labour differs in different agro-ecological conditions and economic conditions.  Initiative/policies  The Cambodian government is working together with NGOs and UN agencies to tackle the problem of child labour. One of the major donors is the U.S Department of Labour. Since 2001, the department has funded ILO's International Program on the Elimination of Child Labour to provide education and other services to children engaged, or are at risk of engaging in exploitive labour. There has been some progress in Cambodia. In 2008 there were 2000 children working in the salt industry in the Kampot province. By 2010 it has decreased to around 250 children. However, Cambodia has been attributed 11 goods, all of them being produced by child labor, in the 2014 U.S. Department of Labor report on such working conditions around the world. = United States generalized system of preferences = The United States Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) gives countries greater access to the United States market if they attempt to give adequate rights to workers. The countries have to ensure the freedom of association, the right to organize and bargain collectively, and the prohibition of forced and child labor. The U.S. does suspend GSP provisions when labour rights are violated, but often fails to do so when the country involved is a major partner in U.S. trade. = U.S.-Cambodia textile agreement = The U.S.-Cambodia Textile Agreement (UCTA) was created as a better alternative to the Generalized System of Preferences. The goal of the UCTA was to increase the garment export quotas by rewarding better working conditions. It was a non-state centered model, which allowed for better enforcement of the regulations. It enforced labour standards in areas such as child labor, forced labor, sexual harassment, hours of work, minimum wages, and freedom of association. This trade agreement was unique because it provided market rewards rather than punishments and because the International Labour Organization (ILO) was in charge of monitoring the labour standards. = ILO Garment Sector Working Conditions Improvement Project = The goals of the project included maintaining an independent monitoring system, creating new laws to improve working conditions, increasing worker and employer awareness of labour laws and rights, and increasing government capacity to comply with national and international labour standards. Monitoring by the ILO has provided much more legitimacy than private monitoring by transnational firms and non-governmental organizations tied to transnational firms. The ILO's monitoring system is characterized by tripartite and consensus governance by employers, unions, and governments. It is more legitimate than private monitoring because it has no connection to the firms. The ILO monitoring system focuses on enforcing Cambodia's labor laws and ILO conventions that Cambodia has ratified. = ChildWise Tourism = ChildWise Tourism was developed in 1999 and it aims to inform tourism staff on how to identify and respond to situations of potential child sexual exploitation. It involves training modules and educational materials for travel and tourism students, educators, and the tourism industry. The training sessions take place in Thailand, Indonesia, Cambodia, Philippines, Lao PDR, Vietnam, and Myanmar.

In most cases, this is accomplished by having the StingRay broadcast a pilot signal that is either stronger than, or made to appear stronger than, the pilot signals being broadcast by legitimate cell sites operating in the area. A common function of all cellular communications protocols is to have the cellular device connect to the cell site offering the strongest signal. StingRays exploit this function as a means to force temporary connections with cellular devices within a limited area.  Extracting data from internal storage  During the process of forcing connections from all compatible cellular devices in a given area, the StingRay operator needs to determine which device is the desired surveillance target. This is accomplished by downloading the IMSI, ESN, or other identifying data from each of the devices connected to the StingRay. In this context, the IMSI or equivalent identifier is not obtained from the cellular service provider or from any other third-party. The StingRay downloads this data directly from the device using radio waves. In some cases, the IMSI or equivalent identifier of a target device is known to the StingRay operator beforehand. When this is the case, the operator will download the IMSI or equivalent identifier from each device as it connects to the StingRay.Florida v. James L.

In other cases, the IMSI or equivalent identifier of a target is not known to the StingRay operator and the goal of the surveillance operation is to identify one or more cellular devices being used in a known area.In the Matter of The Application of the United States of America for An Order Authorizing the Installation and Use of a Pen Register and Trap and Trace Device, 890 F. Supp. 2d 747, 748 (S.D. Tex. 2012) (Law enforcement sought to use StingRay \\"to detect radio signals emitted from wireless cellular telephones in the vicinity of the [Subject] that identify the telephones (e.g., by transmitting the telephone's serial number and phone number)...\\" so the \\"[Subject's] Telephone can be identified.\\" (quoting order application)). For example, if visual surveillance is being conducted on a group of protestors, a StingRay can be used to download the IMSI or equivalent identifier from each phone within the protest area. After identifying the phones, locating and tracking operations can be conducted, and service providers can be forced to turn over account information identifying the phone users.  Forcing an increase in signal transmission power  Cellular telephones are radio transmitters and receivers much like a walkie-talkie. However, the cell phone communicates only with a repeater inside a nearby cell tower installation. At that installation, the devices take in all cell calls in its geographic area and repeat them out to other cell installations which repeat the signals onward to their destination telephone (either by radio or landline wires). Radio is used also to transmit a caller's voice/data back to the receiver's cell telephone. The two-way duplex phone conversation then exists via these interconnections. To make all that work correctly, the system allows automatic increases and decreases in transmitter power (for the individual cell phone and for the tower repeater, too) so that only the minimum transmit power is used to complete and hold the call active, \\"on\\", and allows the users to hear and be heard continuously during the conversation. The goal is to hold the call active but use the least amount of transmitting power, mainly to conserve batteries and be efficient. The tower system will sense when a cell phone is not coming in clearly and will order the cell phone to boost transmit power. The user has no control over this boosting; it may occur for a split second or for the whole conversation. If the user is in a remote location, the power boost may be continuous. In addition to carrying voice or data, the cell phone also transmits data about itself automatically, and that is boosted or not as the system detects need. Encoding of all transmissions ensures that no cross talk or interference occurs between two nearby cell users. The boosting of power, however, is limited by the design of the devices to a maximum setting. The standard systems are not \\"high power\\" and thus can be overpowered by secret systems using much more boosted power that can then take over a user's cell phone. If overpowered that way, a cell phone will not indicate the change due to the secret radio being programmed to hide from normal detection. The ordinary user can not know if their cell phone is captured via overpowering boosts or not. (There are other ways of secret capture that need not overpower, too.) Just as a person shouting drowns out someone whispering, the boost in RF watts of power into the cell telephone system can overtake and control that system‚Äîin total or only a few, or even only one, conversation. This strategy requires only more RF power, and thus it is more simple than other types of secret control. Power boosting equipment can be installed anywhere there can be an antenna, including in a vehicle, perhaps even in a vehicle on the move. Once a secretly boosted system takes control, any manipulation is possible from simple recording of the voice or data to total blocking of all cell phones in the geographic area.  Tracking and locating  A StingRay can be used to identify and track a phone or other compatible cellular data device even while the device is not engaged in a call or accessing data services. A Stingray closely resembles a portable cellphone tower. Typically, law enforcement officials place the Stingray in their vehicle with a compatible computer software. The Stingray acts as a cellular tower to send out signals to get the specific device to connect to it. Cell phones are programmed to connect with the cellular tower offering the best signal. When the phone and Stingray connect, the computer system determines the strength of the signal and thus the distance to the device. Then, the vehicle moves to another location and sends out signals until it connects with the phone. When the signal strength is determined from enough locations, the computer system centralizes the phone and is able to find it. Cell phones are programmed to constantly search for the strongest signal emitted from cell phone towers in the area. Over the course of the day, most cell phones connect and reconnect to multiple towers in an attempt to connect to the strongest, fastest, or closest signal. Because of the way they are designed, the signals that the Stingray emits are far stronger than those coming from surrounding towers. For this reason, all cell phones in the vicinity connect to the Stingray regardless of the cell phone owner's knowledge. From there, the stingray is capable of locating the device, interfering with the device, and collecting personal data from the device.Adam Bates January 25, 2017, and PDF (292.42 KB) EPUB (117.68 KB) MOBI (298.06 KB). \\"Stingray: A New Frontier in Police Surveillance.\\" Cato Institute.

(\\"The Tech 2 Me w/FishHawk GSM Intercept S/W upgrade is the only portable standard + 12VDC powered over the air GSM Active Key Extraction and Intercept system currently available.\\") the StingRay and similar Harris products can be used to intercept GSM communications content transmitted over-the-air between a target cellular device and a legitimate service provider cell site. The StingRay does this by way of the following man-in-the-middle attack: (1) simulate a cell site and force a connection from the target device, (2) download the target device's IMSI and other identifying information, (3) conduct \\"GSM Active Key Extraction\\" to obtain the target device's stored encryption key, (4) use the downloaded identifying information to simulate the target device over-the-air, (5) while simulating the target device, establish a connection with a legitimate cell site authorized to provide service to the target device, (6) use the encryption key to authenticate the StingRay to the service provider as being the target device, and (7) forward signals between the target device and the legitimate cell site while decrypting and recording communications content. The \\"GSM Active Key Extraction\\" performed by the StingRay in step three merits additional explanation. A GSM phone encrypts all communications content using an encryption key stored on its SIM card with a copy stored at the service provider. While simulating the target device during the above explained man- in-the-middle attack, the service provider cell site will ask the StingRay (which it believes to be the target device) to initiate encryption using the key stored on the target device. Therefore, the StingRay needs a method to obtain the target device's stored encryption key else the man-in-the-middle attack will fail. GSM primarily encrypts communications content using the A5/1 call encryption cypher. In 2008 it was reported that a GSM phone's encryption key can be obtained using $1,000 worth of computer hardware and 30 minutes of cryptanalysis performed on signals encrypted using A5/1. However, GSM also supports an export weakened variant of A5/1 called A5/2. This weaker encryption cypher can be cracked in real-time. While A5/1 and A5/2 use different cypher strengths, they each use the same underlying encryption key stored on the SIM card. Therefore, the StingRay performs \\"GSM Active Key Extraction\\" during step three of the man-in-the-middle attack as follows: (1) instruct target device to use the weaker A5/2 encryption cypher, (2) collect A5/2 encrypted signals from target device, and (3) perform cryptanalysis of the A5/2 signals to quickly recover the underlying stored encryption key.Id. Once the encryption key is obtained, the StingRay uses it to comply with the encryption request made to it by the service provider during the man-in-the- middle attack. A rogue base station can force unencrypted links, if supported by the handset software. The rogue base station can send a 'Cipher Mode Settings' element (see GSM 04.08 Chapter 10.5.2.9) to the phone, with this element clearing the one bit that marks if encryption should be used. In such cases the phone display could indicate the use of an unsafe link - but the user interface software in most phones does not interrogate the handset's radio subsystem for use of this insecure mode nor display any warning indication. = Passive capabilities = In passive mode, the StingRay operates either as a digital analyzer, which receives and analyzes signals being transmitted by cellular devices and/or wireless carrier cell sites or as a radio jamming device, which transmits signals that block communications between cellular devices and wireless carrier cell sites. By \\"passive mode,\\" it is meant that the StingRay does not mimic a wireless carrier cell site or communicate directly with cellular devices.  Base station (cell site) surveys  A StingRay and a test phone can be used to conduct base station surveys, which is the process of collecting information on cell sites, including identification numbers, signal strength, and signal coverage areas. When conducting base station surveys, the StingRay mimics a cell phone while passively collecting signals being transmitted by cell-sites in the area of the StingRay. Base station survey data can be used to further narrow the past locations of a cellular device if used in conjunction with historical cell site location information (\\"HCSLI\\") obtained from a wireless carrier. HCSLI includes a list of all cell sites and sectors accessed by a cellular device, and the date and time each access was made. Law enforcement will often obtain HCSLI from wireless carriers in order to determine where a particular cell phone was located in the past. Once this information is obtained, law enforcement will use a map of cell site locations to determine the past geographical locations of the cellular device. However, the signal coverage area of a given cell site may change according to the time of day, weather, and physical obstructions in relation to where a cellular device attempts to access service. The maps of cell site coverage areas used by law enforcement may also lack precision as a general matter. For these reasons, it is beneficial to use a StingRay and a test phone to map out the precise coverage areas of all cell sites appearing in the HCSLI records. This is typically done at the same time of day and under the same weather conditions that were in effect when the HCSLI was logged. Using a StingRay to conduct base station surveys in this manner allows for mapping out cell site coverage areas that more accurately match the coverage areas that were in effect when the cellular device was used.  Usage by law enforcement  = In the United States = The use of the devices has been frequently funded by grants from the Department of Homeland Security. The Los Angeles Police Department used a Department of Homeland Security grant in 2006 to buy a StingRay for \\"regional terrorism investigations\\". However, according to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the \\"LAPD has been using it for just about any investigation imaginable.\\" In addition to federal law enforcement, military and intelligence agencies, StingRays have in recent years been purchased by local and state law enforcement agencies. In 2006, Harris Corporation employees directly conducted wireless surveillance using StingRay units on behalf the Palm Bay Police Department ‚Äî where Harris has a campus ‚Äî in response to a bomb threat against a middle school. The search was conducted without a warrant or Judicial oversight. The American Civil Liberties Union, commonly referred to as the ACLU, confirmed that local police have cell site simulators in Washington, Nevada, Arizona, Alaska, Missouri, New Mexico, Georgia, and Massachusetts. State police have cell site simulators in Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Pennsylvania, and Delaware. Local and state police have cell site simulators in California, Texas, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Tennessee, North Carolina, Virginia, Florida, Maryland, and New York [60]. The police use of cell site simulators is unknown in the remaining states. However, many agencies do not disclose their use of StingRay technology, so these statistics are still potentially an under-representation of the actual number of agencies. According to the most recent information published by the American Civil Liberties Union, 72 law enforcement agencies in 24 states own StingRay technology in 2017. Since 2014, these numbers have increased from 42 agencies in 17 states [60]. The following are federal agencies in the United States that have validated their use of cell site simulators: Federal Bureau of Investigation, Drug Enforcement Administration, US Secret Service, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, US Marshals Service, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, US Army, US Navy, US Marine Corps, US National Guard, US Special Command, and National Security Agency [60].Stingray Tracking Devices: Who's Got Them?\\" American Civil Liberties Union. American Civil Liberties Union, n.d. Web. 24 May 2017 In the 2010-14 fiscal years, the Department of Justice has confirmed spending ‚Äúmore than $71 million on cell- cite simulation technology,‚Äù while the Department of Homeland Security confirmed spending ‚Äúmore than $24 million on cell-cite simulation technology.‚Äù Several court decisions have been issued on the legality of using a Stingray without a warrant, with some courts ruling a warrant is required and others not requiring a warrant. = Outside the United States = Police in Vancouver, BC, Canada admitted after much speculation across the country that they had made use of a Stingray device provided by the RCMP. They also stated that they intended to make use of such devices in the future. Two days later, a statement by Edmonton's police force had been taken as confirming their use of the devices, but they said later that they did not mean to create what they called a miscommunication. Privacy International and The Sunday Times reported on the usage of StingRays and IMSI-catchers in Ireland, against the Irish Garda S√≠och√°na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC), which is an oversight agency of the Irish police force Garda S√≠och√°na. On June 10, 2015 the BBC reported on an investigation by Sky News about possible false mobile phone towers being used by the London Metropolitan Police. Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe refused comment. Between February 2015 and April 2016, over 12 companies in the United Kingdom were authorized to export IMSI-catcher devices to states including Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Turkey. Critics have expressed concern about the export of surveillance technology to countries with poor human rights records and histories of abusing surveillance technology.  Secrecy  The increasing use of the devices has largely been kept secret from the court system and the public. In 2014, police in Florida revealed they had used such devices at least 200 additional times since 2010 without disclosing it to the courts or obtaining a warrant. One of the reasons the Tallahassee police provided for not pursuing court approval is that such efforts would allegedly violate the non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) that police sign with the manufacturer.Monahan, Torin (2016) Built to Lie: Investigating Technologies of Deception, Surveillance, and Control. The Information Society 32(4): 229-240. The American Civil Liberties Union has filed multiple requests for the public records of Florida law enforcement agencies about their use of the cell phone tracking devices. Local law enforcement and the federal government have resisted judicial requests for information about the use of stingrays, refusing to turn over information or heavily censoring it. In June 2014, the American Civil Liberties Union published information from court regarding the extensive use of these devices by local Florida police. After this publication, United States Marshals Service then seized the local police's surveillance records in a bid to keep them from coming out in court. In some cases, police have refused to disclose information to the courts citing non- disclosure agreements signed with Harris Corporation. The FBI defended these agreements, saying that information about the technology could allow adversaries to circumvent it. The ACLU has said \\"potentially unconstitutional government surveillance on this scale should not remain hidden from the public just because a private corporation desires secrecy. And it certainly should not be concealed from judges.\\" In 2015 Santa Clara County pulled out of contract negotiations with Harris for StingRay units, citing onerous restrictions imposed by Harris on what could be released under public records requests as the reason for exiting negotiations.  Criticism  In recent years, legal scholars, public interest advocates, legislators and several members of the judiciary have strongly criticized the use of this technology by law enforcement agencies. Critics have called the use of the devices by government agencies warrantless cell phone tracking, as they have frequently been used without informing the court system or obtaining a warrant. The Electronic Frontier Foundation has called the devices ‚Äúan unconstitutional, all-you-can-eat data buffet.‚Äù In June 2015, WNYC Public Radio published a podcast with Daniel Rigmaiden about the StingRay device. In 2016, Professor Laura Moy of the Georgetown University Law Center filed a formal complaint to the FCC regarding the use of the devices by law enforcement agencies, taking the position that because the devices mimic the properties of cell phone towers, the agencies operating them are in violation of FCC regulation, as they lack the appropriate spectrum licenses. On December 4, 2019, the American Civil Liberties Union and the New York Civil Liberties Union filed a federal lawsuit against the Customs and Border Protection and the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agencies. According to the ACLU, the union had filed a Freedom of Information Act request in 2017, but were not given access to documents. The NYCLU and ACLU proceeded with the lawsuit under the statement that both CBP and ICE had failed, ‚Äúto produce a range of records about their use, purchase, and oversight of Stingrays.‚Äù In an official statement expanding their reasoning for the lawsuit, the ACLU expressed their concern over the Stingrays current and future applications, stating that ICE were using them for ‚Äúunlawfully tracking journalists and advocates and subjecting people to invasive searches of their electronic devices at the border.‚Äù Countermeasures A number of countermeasures to the StingRay and other devices have been developed, for example crypto phones such as GMSK's Cryptophone have firewalls that can identify and thwart the StingRay's actions or alert the user to IMSI capture.

This allows the cells to tolerate the effects of such agents, which are otherwise toxic and mutagenic. The Ada response includes the expression of four genes: ada, alkA, alkB, and aidB. The product of ada gene, the Ada protein, is an activator of transcription of all four genes. DNA bases damaged by alkylation are removed by distinct strategies.  Alkylating agents  The alkylating agents from a group of mutagens and carcinogens that modify DNA by alkylation. Alkyl base lesions can arrest replication, interrupt transcription, or signal the activation of cell cycle checkpoints or apoptosis. In mammals, they could be involved in carcinogenesis, neurodegenerative disease and aging. The alkylating agents can introduce methyl or ethyl groups at all of the available nitrogen and oxygen atoms in DNA bases, providing a number of lesions. The majority of evidence indicates that among the 11 identified base modification two, 3-methyladenine (3meA) and O6-methylguanine (O6-meG), are mainly responsible for the biological effects of alkylation agents.Singer B (1976) All oxygens in nucleic acids react with carcinogenic ethylating agents. Nature 264: 333‚Äì339  Roles of ada-regulated genes  The Ada protein is composed of two major domains, a C-terminal domain and an N-terminal one, linked by a hinge region susceptible to proteolytic cleavage. These domains can function independently. AdaCTD transfers methyl adducts from O6-meG and O4-meG onto its Cys-321 residue, whereas AdaNTD demethylates methyl-phosphotriesters by methyl transfer onto its Cys-38 residue.Lindahl T, Sedgwick B, Sekiguchi M, Nakabeppu Y (1988) Regulation and expression of the adaptive response to alkylating agents. Annual Review of Biochemistry. 57: 133‚Äì157Moore MH, Gulbis JM, Dodson EJ, Demple B, Moody PC (1994) Crystal structure of a suicidal DNA repair protein: the Ada O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase from E. coli.

Journal of the American Chemical Society. 125: 1450‚Äì1451. The alkA gene encodes a glycosylase that repairs a variety of lesions including N-7-Methylguanine and N-3-Methylpurines and O2-methyl pyrimidines. The AlkA protein removes a damaged base from the sugar-phosphate backbone by cleaving the glycosylic bond attaching the base to the sugar, producing an abasic site. Further processing of the abasic site by AP endonucleases, polymerase I, and ligase then completes the repair.Volkert, M. R. 1988. Adaptive response of Escherichia coli to alkylation damage. Environmental and Molecular Mutagenesis. 11:241‚Äì255. AlkB, one of the Escherichia coli adaptive response proteins, uses an Œ± ketoglutarate/Fe(II)-dependent mechanism that, by chemical oxidation, removes a variety of alkyl lesions from DNA, thus affording protection of the genome against alkylation.Deyu Li, James C. Delaney, Charlotte M. Page, et al., \\"Repair of DNA Alkylation Damage by the Escherichia coli Adaptive Response Protein AlkB as Studied by ESI-TOF Mass Spectrometry,\\" Journal of Nucleic Acids, vol. 2010, Article ID 369434, 9 pages, 2010. The AidB protein has been supposed to take part in the degradation of endogenous alkylating agents.Landini P, Hajec LI, Volkert MR (1994) Structure and transcriptional regulation of the Escherichia coli adaptive response gene aidB. Journal of Bacteriology. 176: 6583‚Äì6589.Rohankhedkar MS, Mulrooney SB, Wedemeyer WJ, Hausinger RP (2006) The AidB component of the Escherichia coli adaptive response to alkylating agents is a flavin containing, DNA-binding protein. Journal of Bacteriology. 188:223‚Äì230. It shows some homology to acyl- CoA oxidases and those containing flavins. Recent observations suggest that AidB may bind to double-stranded DNA and take part in its dealkylation. However, to determine the precise function of AidB further investigations are necessary.  Regulation of transcription  Ada Regulatory network The Ada response includes the expression of four genes: ada, alkA, alkB, and aidB. The product of the ada gene, the Ada protein is an activator of transcription of all four genes. Ada has two active methyl acceptor cysteine residues that are required for demethylation of DNA. Both sites can become methylated when Ada protein transfers the methyl group from the appropriate DNA lesions to itself. This reaction is irreversible and methylated Ada (me-Ada) can act as a transcriptional activator. The Ada protein activates the transcription of the Ada regulon in two different ways. In case of the ada-alkB operon, and the aidB promoter, the N-terminal domain (AdaNTD) is involved in DNA binding and interacts with the a unit of RNA polymerase, whereas and the methylated C-terminal domain (me-AdaCTD) interacts with the œÉ70 subunit of RNA polymerase. Although these interactions are independent, both are necessary for transcription activation. For activation of alkA gene, the AdaNTD interacts with both, the Œ± and œÉ subunits of RNA polymerase, and activates transcription. In contrast to the ada and aidB promoters, the unmethylated form of the Ada protein, as well as methylated form of the AdaNTD, is able to activate the transcription at alkA. Methylated Ada is able to activate transcription by œÉS as well as œÉ70 at both the ada and aidB promoters.Landini, P., L. I. Hajec, L. H. Nguyen, R. R. Burgess, and M. R. Volkert.1996. The leucine-responsive protein (lrp) acts as a specific repressor for sigmaS -dependent transcription of the Escherichia coli aidB gene. Molecular Microbiology. 20:947‚Äì955.Taverna, P., and B. Sedgwick. 1996. Generation of endogenous methylating agents by nitrosation in Escherichia coli. Journal of Bacteriology. 178:5105‚Äì5111. In contrast, not only does me-Ada fail to stimulate alkA transcription by œÉS, but it negatively affects œÉS dependent transcription. Intracellular concentrations of œÉS increase when the cells reach stationary phase; this in turn results in a me-Ada mediated decrease in the expression of AlkA. Therefore, an increase in expression of the adaptive response genes, in parallel with the expression of genes producing endogenous alkylators during the stationary phase, prevents alkylation damage to DNA and mutagenesis.  Homologues of the Ada regulon in humans  In human cells, the alkyltransferase activity is the product of the MGMT gene.Harris AL, Karran P, Lindahl T (1983) O6-Methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase of human lymphoid cells: structural and kinetic properties and absence in repair deficient cells. Cancer Res 43: 3247‚Äì3252.Kataoka H, Hall J, Karran P (1986) Complementation of sensitivity to alkylating agents in Escherichia coli and Chinese hamster ovary cells by expression of a cloned bacterial DNA repair gene. EMBO Journal. 5:3195‚Äì3200. The 21.7 kDa MGMT protein is built of amino- acid sequences very similar to those of E. coli alkyltransferases, like Ada. In contrast to the bacterial enzymes it mainly repairs O6meG, whereas removal of the alkyl adduct from O4meT is much slower and significantly less effective.Brennand J, Margison GP (1986) Expression in mammalian cells of a truncated Escherichia coli gene coding for O6-alkylguanine alkyltransferase reduces the toxic effects of alkylating agents. Carcinogenesis 7: 2081‚Äì2084.Koike G, Maki H, Takeya H, Hayakawa H, Sekiguchi M (1990) Purification, structure, and biochemical properties of human O6-methylguanine- DNA methyltransferase. Journal of Biological Chemistry. 265:14754‚Äì14762. The preferential repair of O6meG is profitable for eukaryotic cells since in experimental animals treated with alkylating carcinogens this lesion is involved in tumor stimulation. Unlike the Ada and the human MGMT methyltransferases, AlkB and its human homologs hABH2 and hABH3 not only reverse alkylation base damage directly, but they do so catalytically and with a substrate specificity aimed at the base-pairing interface of the G:C and A:T base pairs.Trewick, S.

It also stars Shahana Goswami, Dalip Tahil and Chinese- American actor Tom Wu in supporting roles, along with Rajinikanth, Sanjay Dutt and Priyanka Chopra making guest appearances. The film is jointly produced by Eros International and Khan's production company, Red Chillies Entertainment, and was originally scheduled to release on 3 June 2011. However, due to extensive post-production work involving special effects and the 3D conversion, its release was postponed, and saw a worldwide opening during the Diwali weekend of 26 October 2011. The album features fifteen tracks, and was released on 21 September 2011 by T-Series. Production The soundtrack of Ra.One was composed by Vishal‚ÄìShekhar whilst the lyrics were penned by Atahar Panchi, Vishal Dadlani, Kumaar, Anubhav Sinha and Anvita Dutt Guptan. In addition to composing the film's soundtrack, the music directors brought together the 200-piece Prague Philharmonic Orchestra to record the film's background score. They said, \\"Shahrukh and Anubhav wanted a particular sound and we have managed to bring it alive for [the film].\\" Director Anubhav Sinha announced that the soundtrack would also feature two songs recorded by Senegalese American R&B; singer Akon. It is said that Shahrukh Khan met the singer in New York and became his \\"big fan\\", then he asked him to fly down to India to record a song for the film. Akon arrived to Mumbai in March 2010 for two days to record both the songs Chammak Challo and Criminal. Shahrukh Khan, Kareena Kapoor and Ra.One director Anubhav Sinha held a press conference to declare the association of the Grammy Award winning singer with the film. The song Chammak Challo was co-composed by Akon and was recorded at the Yash Raj Studios. The makers of the film have complied with international copyright laws and have obtained the license to use Ben E. King's song, \\"Stand By Me\\", on which they have based the song \\"Dildaara\\". The song Jiya Mora Ghabraaye was originally composed as an instrumental piece as a part of the background score, but due to great appreciation from the production team, it was eventually converted into an original track and added to the album. Music producer, Abhijit Vaghani stated: \\"Our mindset was in the zone of all superhero movies for the score (...) I've taken my engineers in my car along with a mike and recorded sounds from inside my car. The point of this was, one of the pieces, which was the 'chase' sequence was so loved by all that it eventually got converted into a track called 'Jiya Mora'. I also added the 'dub step' in the middle of the track.\\" Vaghani also revealed that they have created a Spanish piece which he has sung in as well, it consists of an interaction scene between the two people. They have also called a Spanish translator to come up with the lyrics. The piece however, was not included in the soundtrack. Music rights was bought by T-Series for a record sum of . Release Ra.One audio launch The soundtrack was heavily promoted pre- release. The music of the film was dedicated to Yash Johar and Bobby Chawla. Originally scheduled to release on 21 September 2011, the film's entire music album was leaked online two days earlier. Four months prior to this, the rough version of \\"Chammak Challo\\" was leaked on the internet in May 2011. In August, T-Series sent a legal notice to a jewellery brand for illegally using the unreleased song at the India International Jewellery Week 2011, asking for a compensation of 20 million. The film's music launch took place in a huge set at Mumbai's Film City where performances were seen by the film's music directors and cast members. The star studded event's telecast rights were sold to a TV channel for . Radio Mirchi ran a contest through which it gave its listeners a chance to not only attend the music launch event but also meet the stars of the film. The Tamil version of the audio was released in Satyam Cinemas, Chennai on 5 October 2011. Shahrukh Khan along with Mani Ratnam, Suhasini Maniratnam, Santosh Sivan, Soundarya Rajinikanth and Abirami Ramanathan were present in the occasion. The songs of the film have also been dubbed in Telugu, which was released on 9 October 2011. The lyrics for the Tamil version have been penned by Vairamuthu while the lyrics for the Telugu version have been penned by Vanamali, Rajshri Sudhakar and Bhuvanachandra. Both the versions of the album have been met by a huge positive response from the audience in south India. Due to the extremely positive response for the album, especially the song Chammak challo, Akon decided to branch out and make tracks especially for Bollywood projects and now wants to have a dedicated branch into producing music for Bollywood with local talent. Sinha later revealed that there remained eight songs not selected for the final soundtrack, and that there was a possibility of releasing them in a separate album. Reception =Critical reception= Upon release, the album was met by overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics. Joginder Tuteja from Bollywood Hungama gave it 4.5 out of 5 stars, concluding: \\"Ra.One has brilliancy written all over it and is clearly a huge winner all the way.

The recipient of the 2005 Montana Governor's Arts Award for Literature, Paul Zarzyski received his Master of Fine Arts Degree in creative writing in the mid-1970s at the University of Montana, where he studied with Richard Hugo, Madeline DeFrees, and John Haines, and where he later taught Hugo's classes after his passing. In the same breath in which he first pursued his poetry passion, he discovered a second unexpected calling‚Äîbareback bronc riding‚Äîand competed on the amateur, ProRodeo, and Senior circuits into his early forties. Zarzyski has performed at the annual National Cowboy Poetry Gathering in Elko, NV for the past 30 years, has toured Canada, Australia, Wales, England, and Russia, has recited at the National Book, Folk, and Storytelling Festivals, at The Kennedy Center Millennium Stage and the Library of Congress, and has appeared with the Reno Philharmonic Orchestra and the Spokane Symphony. He was also featured on Garrison Keillor's A Prairie Home Companion, aired from The Mother Lode Theater in BUTTE! The author of twelve books and chapbooks, Paul's most recent collections were published by Bozeman's Bangtail Press: Steering With My Knees: Zarzyski Lite in 2014 and, in 2011, his ‚Äútriptych,‚Äù 51: 30 Poems, 20 Lyrics, 1 Self-Interview, the latter offering 120 pages of question- answer prose that traces his otherworldly journey from his 1950's and '60's, rural, Polish-Italian, blue-collar childhood in Hurley, Wisconsin to the poetic pages and stages of the American West. Imbued with the belief that the music of poetry will, at times, blossom into song, Paul has applied his poetics to the art of the lyric and has co-written ‚Äúwestern hits‚Äù recorded by Ian Tyson, Tom Russell, Wylie Gustafson, David Wilkie of Cowboy Celtic, Don Edwards, and other esteemed musicians. Two of these collaborations, one with Wylie and one with Tom, received the Western Writers of America Spur Award for best song of 2010 and 2011, respectively, while another of Paul's works, ‚ÄúBob Dylan Bronc Song‚Äù also earned The Spur in 2010 for poetry. In January 2016, Paul's fifth spoken-word studio recording was released, a double CD of poems, sporting the same title as his latest book, Steering With My Knees, and offering extensive, and at times ‚Äúexotic,‚Äù musical compositions that include saxophone, slide/resonator guitar, didgeridoo, trumpet, trombone, flugelhorn, drums, blues harmonica, jaw harp, organ, tuba, accordion, piano, cello, banjo, theremin, etc. The project's elegant digibook presentation was designed by Paul's long-time friend and collaborator, Missoula artist, Larry Pirnie. Two earlier recordings, Words Growing Wild (1998) and The Glorious Commotion Of It All (2004), both produced by Jim Rooney in Nashville, offer poems with accompaniment by Duane Eddy, John Hartford, and other fine musicians, while two later disks, Rock-n-Rowel and Collisions Of Reckless Love (both, 2007), were produced by Open Path Music of San Jose, CA.‚Äîalso at the helm of the current recording project. Paul makes his home, ‚Äúwhere the poetry roams,‚Äù west of Great Falls with art historian and C.M.

In summer 2011, the AWLU Project team determined that Malaysia would be the host country of the Asian Women's Leadership University (AWLU). Projected to open in September 2021, the AWLU will be a private, not-for-profit university modeled on the U.S. ‚ÄúSeven Sisters‚Äù liberal arts and sciences colleges. The AWLU will combine American- style liberal arts and sciences education with leadership courses and a curriculum regionally relevant to Asia. AWLU will seek promising women from diverse backgrounds to be a part of its vibrant residential learning community.  History  The Asian Women‚Äôs Leadership University (AWLU) Project was founded in 2010 when three Smith College graduates with roots in Asia met through the Smith alumni network. As beneficiaries of the positive impact of a Seven Sisters college education, the founders wanted to extend the positive impacts of a supportive and empowering education to young women outside of the United States. Through extensive discussions, the mission of AWLU was established: to build a global educational institution dedicated to empowering women from developing economies. It is envisioned that AWLU graduates will have more than a degree - they will have the leadership skills to promote cross-cultural understanding, regional development and international cooperation. The AWLU Project was put on hiatus in 2015 and was revived in 2019.  Current Progress  The AWLU Project continues to gain international recognition and support in its effort to establish a global women's leadership university for women from Asia and the Middle East. The AWLU Project has secured the commitment of institutions such as Smith College to offer its executive education programmes and Mills College on curricular development and design. It is also currently partnered with the Women's Empowerment Institute (Institut Wanita Berdaya, or IWB), a policy development and research body, to look at the viability of a women‚Äôs leadership university in Malaysia and the Asian region. The research examines how such an institution can support a more gender-equitable leadership environment as well as provide innovative and effective pathways to social change. All progress thus far has been achieved through a dedicated working Steering Committee, a distinguished group of senior leaders in Malaysia, and an enthusiastic set of global volunteers. The AWLU Project's current priorities include securing the Malaysian Ministry of Education's license to establish the AWLU as an approved university in Malaysia. If such approval should be obtained, full fundraising and establishment efforts are expected to commence. In November 2012, AWLU's rise was documented by the New York Times article \\"Leadership University Rises for Asian Women\\". The AWLU Project has since been featured at the 2013 Harvard EdTalks and on GOOD Magazine's 2013 Top 100 List, among other features. The AWLU Project was incubated at the Harvard innovation lab during 2013 in Cambridge, MA.

Background On 1 September 1969, while King Idris of Libya was in Turkey for medical treatment, he was deposed in a coup by a group of Libyan army officers under the leadership of Lieutenant Colonel Muammar al-Gaddafi. The monarchy was abolished and a republic proclaimed. The coup pre-empted Idris' abdication and the succession of his heir the following day. Over the next few months, Libyan policy towards foreigners changed drastically. The revolutionary council approved a new constitution, which described Libya as Arab, free, and democratic. In the name of Arab nationalism the new government nationalized most oil holdings, seized Italian and Jewish possessions, closed U.S. and British military bases (including the American Wheelus Air Base, renamed \\"Oqba ibn Nafi\\" after the first Arab-Muslim conqueror of North Africa.  Expulsions of Italians and Jews  On 21 July 1970 the revolutionary council issued a special law to ‚Äòregain wealth stolen from the Libyan people by Italian oppressors‚Äô (as stated by Gaddafi in a speech a few days later). With this law, Italians who had long lived in Libya were required to leave the country by 7 October 1970. 7 October would be celebrated as the Day of Revenge, a Libyan national holiday. About 20,000 Italians and 37,000 Jews were expelled from the country. The coup d'√©tat of Muammar al-Gaddafi (influenced by Gamal Abdel Nasser‚Äôs Arab nationalism) was driven by the conviction that foreigners were still exploiting Libya, and Gaddafi made their eviction a hallmark of his program. By the end of 1970 all foreign holdings were seized, and nearly all Jews and Italians had left the country. The late Muammar al-Gaddafi officially abolished the celebrations in 2004, after a treaty between Libya and Italy was signed. = Italians in Libya = The Italian invasion of Libya dated back to 1911, as a result of Italian ambitions in North Africa. Libya was annexed to the Italian Kingdom with the Lausanne Treaty of 1923, which concluded the Italo-Turkish War of 1912. For several years, few Italian nationals lived in the new colony. When the Fascist regime gained power in Italy, the colonization of Libya was increased; thousands of Italian settlers poured into the country with promises of free land and financial aid. By 1939, Italians in Libya numbered 108,419 (12.37 percent of the total population) according to census figures; plans envisioned 500,000 Italian settlers by the 1960s. The Italian population was concentrated in the coast around the cities of Tripoli (37 percent of its population) and Bengasi (31 percent). With the Italian defeat in World War II, Italian influence waned as a result. After several years under British mandate, on 24 December 1951 Libya declared its independence as the United Kingdom of Libya (a constitutional, hereditary monarchy under King Idris). Although many Italians had already left the former colony, many remained as well (primarily farmers and craftsmen). King Idris was a tolerant monarch, and generally treated the Italian population well. = Libyan Jews = Libyan Jews (who had lived in Libya since the 3rd century BC) were granted citizenship; their passports labeled them as \\"Libyan Jews\\" (\\"Yahud Liby\\"). Their civil and political rights were restricted, under the assumption that they had connections with Israel. In 1945 and 1948 the Jews suffered pogroms, and most left Libya for Israel in 1948. About 7,000 remained in Libya until they were forced to leave after the pogrom in June 1967, during which 15 were killed. Between 1951 (the independence of Libya) and 1970, the Italian population was not granted Libyan citizenship. The remaining Libyan Jews migrated to Israel, and their property, money, and belongings were seized by the Libyan government.

The Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Austria, Governor of the Spanish Netherlands, retook the city of Venlo from the United Provinces, which had taken control of it in 1632 during the offensive of Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange against Maastricht. The capture of Venlo and Roermond, which was surrendered to the Cardinal-Infante a week later, effectively cut Maastricht from the Dutch Republic, thus preventing further attacks on the Spanish Netherlands from the east.Van Nimwegen, Olaf: The Dutch Army and the Military Revolutions, 1588-1688.

In the southern front Ferdinand lost the towns of La Capelle, Landrecies, and Damvillers to the French, but then he forced them to retreat south of Maubeuge.Thion, St√©phane: French Armies of the Thirty Years' War. Auzielle: LRT Editions, 2008. , p. 23. Background After recovery of the Dutch fortress of Schenk in April 1636, Spain adopted a defensive strategy in the Dutch front of the war between the United Provinces and France against Spain.Israel, p. 74 In the first months of 1636, the Count-Duke of Olivares insisted the Cardinal-Infante to continue concentrating the war effort in exploiting his gains in the Lower Rhine and in northern Brabant rather than in an offensive against France.Israel, p. 73 In late May, however, the offensive operations were suspended and a secondary thrust was launched into France. The invasion succeeded in capturing a large number of fortresses and menaced Paris, but Ferdinand considered that more ambitious operations could risk his over-stretched army and retreated.Israel, p. 77 For the campaign of 1637 Olivares planned a renewed offensive against France, so Ferdinand began to mass his forces on the French border.Israel, p. 80 In July the statholder Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange, seized the moment and marched into northern Barbant in command of an army of 18,000 soldiers determined to besiege Breda. On 21 July 1637 some Dutch cavalry under Henry Casimir I of Nassau-Dietz attempted to surprise the garrison of Breda, but the gates were closed in time and the Dutch skirmishers driven back. From 23 July the Dutch captured a number of villages around the city and then started to dig a double line of circumvallation that would eventually reach a circumference of 34 km. An outer contravallation defended the besiegers from outside interference, and outside this area the low-lying countryside was inundated by damming a few rivers.Arend, p. 71 The Cardinal-Infante, who had come with his army to Breda, found no way to relieve the city and decided to open an offensive against the Dutch in the Maas valley. Siege The Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand, by Jan van den Hoecke. Ferdinand abandoned Goirle and Tilburg and marched with his army to Hilvarenbeek, where his troops crossed the Dommel river over the bridge of Halder, located a league from Den Bosch, and camped in Helmond, Neerwert, Heutsingben, and Rogelen.Commelin, p. 368 He ordered the Marquis Sigismondo Sfondrati to cross the Meuse through the bridge of Gennep with some companies and wend to Venlo, where he arrived the next day. By then the garrison had been warned, but Ferdinand decided to invest the town and entrusted this task to the Marquis of Sfondrati.Commelin, p. 369 They confronted the governor of Venlo, Nicolaas van Brederode, a bastard of the noble family of van Brederode who has at his disposition 15 companies of infantry and some cavalry troops amounting to a total of 1,000 or 1,200 men. Van Brederode judged that he had no enough troops to defend the inside and outside of the town, so he ordered his troops to guard the gates and the boulevards and assigned the rest to the burghers of the town. The Cardinal-Infante arrived at the camp the next day and divided his army into four corps. One was placed in command of the Count John of Nassau and was quartered with the troops of the Count of Rietberg and other imperial troops, another marched to the north led by of the Count of Ribecourt, consisting of two regiments and troops from Fratras, Geldre, Gennep and Brion. Colonel Roveroy quartered his troops, the regiments of Faramont and Lodrons, south of the city, and the Count of Feria did it on the east with the Spanish Tercio of the Marquis of Velada, the Old Tercio of the Count of Fuenclara, all the baggage, and the court of the Cardinal-Infante. When the camp was ready, trenches began to be dug, both from the horn of Blerick and from three other locations. At the same time were made the approaches and at each quartes was built a battery of five cannons that began to beat the town incessantly. At first the garrison of Venlo and the burghers responded to this fire with their artillery, but when the Spanish advanced in their approaches and set fire to the town with their shells, the burghers rebelled against Van Brederode and went to City Hall to demand to the magistrates that sued the governor for a cessation of hostilities. Meanwhile, the women climbed the walls and begged for mercy to the Spanish. Van Brederode decided then to send a drummer called Corneille Poorter to negotiate the surrender with the Cardinal-Infante.  Aftermath  The Cardinal-Infante, surprised by the ease of the victory, left some troops in Venlo and continued his offensive. A week later his cavalry rapidly invested the town of Roermond, defended by a Colonel called Carpentier, and after another heavy bombardment forced its garrison to surrender.Commelin, p. 370 1,100 Dutch infantry soldiers and 2 companies of cavalry left the town with weapons and baggage, and were convoyed to Grave. Ferdinand considered then besieging then Grave, Nijmegen or perhaps Maastricht, but advised by his commanders, he finally decided to cease the offensive alarmed by French advances in the south. The capture of Venlo and Roermond, nevertheless, was joyful received by the Southern Netherlands populaceIsrael p.184 and allowed Ferdinand to isolate Maastricht from the United Provinces.Sanz p.207 However, Frederick Henry refused to lift the siege of Breda despite this setback and the city finally surrendered to him on October 11. The loss of Breda supposed a considerable blow to Philip's IV prestige, as Breda was a symbol of the Spanish power in Europe.

If conservative treatment of a minor ingrown toenail does not succeed or if the ingrown toenail is severe, surgical management by a podiatrist is recommended. The initial surgical approach is typically a partial avulsion of the nail plate known as a wedge resection or a complete removal of the toenail. If the ingrown toenail recurs despite this treatment, destruction of the germinal matrix with phenol is recommended. Antibiotics are not needed if surgery is performed. Wedge resection The physician will perform an onychectomy in which the nail along the edge that is growing into the skin is cut away (ablated) and the offending piece of nail is pulled out. Any infection is surgically drained. This process is referred to as a \\"wedge resection\\" or simple surgical ablation and is not permanent (i.e., the nail will re-grow from the matrix). The entire procedure may be performed in a physician's office in approximately thirty to forty-five minutes depending on the extent of the problem. The patient is allowed to go home the same day and the recovery time is anywhere from two weeks to two months barring any complications such as infection. As a follow-up, a physician may prescribe an oral or topical antibiotic or a special soak to be used for about a week after the surgery. Some use \\"lateral onychoplasty,\\" or \\"wedge resection,\\" as the method of choice for ingrown toenails. A wide wedge resection, with a total cleaning (removal) of nail matrix, has a nearly 100% success rate. Some physicians will not perform a complete nail avulsion (removal) except under extreme circumstances. In most cases, these physicians will remove both sides of a toenail (even if one side is not currently ingrown) and coat the nail matrix on both sides with a chemical or acid (usually phenol) to prevent re-growth. This leaves most of the nail intact, but ensures that the problem of ingrowth will not recur. There are possible disadvantages if the nail matrix is not coated with the applicable chemical or acid (phenol) and is allowed to re-grow; this method is prone to failure. Also, the underlying condition can still become symptomatic if the nail grows back within a year: the nail matrix could be growing a nail that is too curved, thick, wide or otherwise irregular to allow normal growth. Furthermore, the flesh can become injured by concussion, tight socks, quick twisting motions while walking, or simply because the nail is growing incorrectly (likely too wide). This hypersensitivity to continued injury can mean chronic ingrowth; the solution is nearly always edge avulsion by the more effective procedure of phenolisation. Avulsion procedure In case of recurrence after complete removal, and if the patient never felt any pain before inflammation occurred, the condition is more likely to be onychia which is often confused for an ingrown or ingrowing nail (onychocryptosis). Complete removal of the whole nail is a simple procedure. Anaesthetic is injected and the nail is removed quickly by pulling it outward from the toe. The patient can function normally right after the procedure and most of the discomfort goes away in a few days. The entire procedure can be performed in approximately 20 minutes and is less complex than the wedge resection. The nail often grows back, however, and in most cases it can cause more problems by becoming ingrown again. It can get injured by concussion and in some cases grows back too thick, too wide or deformed. This procedure can result in chronic ingrown nails causing more pain. Accordingly, in some cases as determined by a doctor, the nail matrix is coated with a chemical (usually phenol) so none of the nail will ever grow back. This is known as a permanent or full nail avulsion, or full matrixectomy, phenolisation, or full phenol avulsion. As can be seen in the images below, the nail-less toe does not look like a normal toe. Fake nails or nail varnish can still be applied to the area to provide a normal appearance. In a few cases phenolisation is not successful and has to be repeated. Podiatrists routinely warn patients of this possibility of regrowth.http://www.orthotics-london.com/optimotion.pdf Vandenbos procedure The Vandenbos procedure was first described by Vandenbos and Bowers in 1959 in the US Armed Forces Medical Journal. They reported on 55 patients, all without recurrences. Since 1988 Dr. Henry Chapeskie has performed this procedure on over 2,700 patients who had no recurrences. Unlike other procedures, the Vandenbos procedure does not touch the nail. In this procedure, the affected toe is anesthetized with a digital block and a tourniquet is applied. An incision is made proximally from the base of the nail about 5 mm (leaving the nail bed intact) then extended toward the side of the toe/toenail in an elliptical sweep to end up under the tip of the nail about 3‚Äì4 mm in from the edge. It is important that all the skin at the edge of the nail be removed. The excision must be adequate leaving a soft tissue deficiency measuring 1.5 √ó 3 cm. A portion of the lateral aspect of the distal phalanx is occasionally exposed without fear of infection. Antibiotics are not necessary as the wound is left open to close by secondary intention. Postoperative management involves soaking of the toe in warm water 3 times/day for 15‚Äì20 minutes. The wound is healed in 4‚Äì6 weeks. No cases of osteomyelitis have been reported. After healing, the nail fold skin remains low and tight at the side of the nail. The rationale is that the nail itself is usually healthy, but overgrown by skin; when walking, the bilateral nail folds are pressed upwards, which is why narrowing the nail causes excessive recurrences, contrary to narrowing the nail fold.https://www.overgrowntoeskin.ca/toe- surgery Image:Vandenbosbefore1.jpgIngrown toenail before Vandenbos procedure Image:Vandenbosduring1.jpgIntraoperative toe (ingrown toenail) during the procedure Image:Vandenbosduring2.jpgIntraoperative toe (ingrown toenail) during the procedure Image:vandenbosafter1.jpgHealed ingrown toenail after Vandenbos procedure Image:vandenbosafter2.jpgHealed ingrown toenail after Vandenbos procedure Image:Vandenbosbefore.JPGIngrown toenail before Vandenbos procedure Image:vandenbosafter.jpgHealed ingrown toenail after Vandenbos procedure  The Syme procedure  In difficult or recurrent cases of onychocryptosis (ingrown toenail) the patient's symptoms persist necessitating a permanent operative solution. The \\"avulsion procedure\\" is simple but the surgeon must be skilled enough to accomplish total destruction, and removal of, the nail matrix. Another disadvantage is the long healing and recovery time(> 2 months). In these cases, the best method is the Syme procedure, that means total nail matrix removal + skin flap transfer + phalanx partial osteotomy + stitching. Phenolisation Toe after phenolisation Following injection of a local anaesthetic at the base of the toenail and perhaps application of a tourniquet, the surgeon will remove (ablate) the edge of the nail growing into the flesh and destroy the matrix area with phenol to permanently and selectively ablate the matrix that is producing the ingrown portion of the nail (i.e., the nail margin). This is known as a partial matrixectomy, phenolisation, phenol avulsion or partial nail avulsion with matrix phenolisation. Also, any infection is surgically drained. After this procedure, other suggestions on aftercare will be made, such as salt water bathing of the toe. The purpose of the procedure is to prevent re-growth where the matrix was cauterized. After the procedure, the nail is slightly narrower (usually one millimeter or so) and is barely noticeable a year later. The surgery is advantageous because it can be performed in the doctor's office under local anesthesia and recovery time is minimal. There is no visible scar on the surgery site and a nominal chance of recurrence. However, if the phenol is improperly or inadequately applied, the nail matrix can regenerate from its partial cauterization and grow a new nail. This will result in a recurrence of the ingrown nail in approximately 4‚Äì6 months as the skin that the original ingrown nail grew under would also recover from the procedure. The recovery of the skin on either side of the nail is standard in this type of procedure. Many patients who suffer from a minor recurrence of the ingrown nail often have the procedure performed again. However, in cases of severe recurrence, a podiatrist can perform the procedure again or resort to a more involved, permanent solution such as removal of the entire nail or the Vandenbos Procedure.

Like other desktops in the IdeaCentre product line, the B Series desktops were designed for home users, with a focus on the consumer PC segment. The first model in the series was the B500. 2012 The IdeaCentre B Series desktops released in 2012 were the B340 and the B540. =B340= The IdeaCentre B340 was introduced by Lenovo just before CES 2012. The B340 was a 21.5-inch touchscreen desktop designed for multimedia use. The all-in-one offered a 1080p HD display, with a maximum resolution of 1920x1080. Multiple Intel Core i processors were on offer, up to NVIDIA GeForce 615M discrete graphics with 1GB of video RAM, up to 2TB of storage space, and up to 8GB of RAM. The all-in-one also offered OneKey TV, allowing users to use the display for TV viewing, even if the PC had not been booted. The display could be configured for 3D output and Blu-ray compatibility. =B540= Described as the \\"bigger brother\\" of the B340, the B540 offered a 23-inch widescreen display. Like the B340, this all-in-one also offered a 1080p HD touch screen, Intel processors, NVIDIA discrete graphics, and similar specifications for both storage capacity and memory. A difference between the two was that the B540 had a frameless screen, with the glass surface extending from one edge of the display to the other. Another difference was the discrete graphics offering. The B540 could be equipped with an NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M, with up to 2GB of video RAM. 2011 The IdeaCentre B Series desktops released in 2011 were the B510 and the B520. =B510= The IdeaCentre B510 was equipped with up to Intel Core i5-650 3.2 GHz processors, the Intel H55 Express chipset, up to 16GB RAM, a 1TB 7200RPM hard disk drive, a 23-inch LCD with an aspect ratio of 16:9 and a maximum resolution of 1920x1080. The desktop supported ATI Radeon HD 5570 discrete graphics, HD audio with integrated stereo speakers, and had an integrated 0.3 megapixel web camera. As with most IdeaCentre B Series desktops, the B510 had a wireless Bluetooth mouse and keyboard. =B520= Announced at CES 2011, the B520 was the successor to the B500 released in 2010. PC World described the AIO as the most attractive all- in-one they had seen. Among the new features included was multitouch support. The desktop also included up to Intel Core i7 processors, Intel HD 3000 integrated graphics or NVIDIA GeForce GT 555M discrete graphics. The discrete graphics card was necessary to take advantage of the desktop's 3D capabilities. The B520 could be equipped with up to 16GB DDR3 RAM. Hard disk support for both SATA and Solid State Drive was available, with up to 2TB SATA hard disk drive or a 32GB solid state drive. The B520 sported a 23-inch full HD display, with support for 3D Vision which was an optional feature. As with previous B Series desktops, the speakers were integrated, offering Dolby Surround Sound 5.0. =B320= Lenovo IdeaCentre B320 all in one PC features include 2nd generation Intel Core i3 processor, a 21.5-inch Full HD display, supporting multi-touch technology, SRS Premium Sound audio enhancement and host of other multimedia applications embedded in it. 2010 The IdeaCentre B Series desktops released in 2010 were the B500, B300, B305, and B310. =B500= Released in 2010, the IdeaCentre B500 was an all-in-one (AIO) desktop with a sharp, angular design. The AIO had an aluminum cover below the screen, and a matching brushed metal effect on the Bluetooth keyboard. Engadget reported that the keyboard displayed issues with the wireless connection, a point that they indicated had been mentioned by other reviewers. The B500 desktop released in Hong Kong had an Intel Core 2 Quad Q8400S processor. However, the US version of the desktop offered an Intel Pentium Dual Core E5400 processor or a Core 2 Duo E7500. The desktop could also be equipped with up to 4GB RAM and a 500GB 7200 RPM hard disk drive. The desktop offered NVIDIA GeForce GT240M discrete graphics which was capable of handling HD videos, but not games for hardcore gamers, as indicated by Engadget. =B300= The B300 was another AIO released in the IdeaCentre B Series in 2010. PCWorld.in described it as a desktop for budget-conscious buyers. In terms of design, it was similar to the B500. However, the B500 was a 23-inch desktop, while the B300 was a 20-inch desktop. The B300 had a slim design resembling a photo frame with glossy black plastic. The stand was similar in design and made of plastic as well, unlike the A70z which sported a steel stand. The desktop offered an Intel Core 2 Duo 3.03 GHz processor, ATI Radeon HD 5450 graphics, a maximum resolution of 1600x900, 4GB RAM, and a 640GB hard disk drive. The desktop also included six USB ports, as well as FireWire, Gigabit Ethernet, a multicard reader, and headphone and microphone jacks. =B305= The IdeaCentre B305 was also released in 2010. It was an AIO, like other models in the series, and received contrasting reviews from PCMag and PC Pro. PC Pro described the desktop as being admirably thin, comparing it to the 21.5 inch Apple iMacs. The B305 offered an identically sized screen, larger hard disk space (640GB) and Windows 7 as opposed to OS X. Picture was described as having a ‚Äúcold grey cast‚Äù while colors were indicated to be drab. The US version of the desktop offered a TV tuner and Media Center remote ‚Äì however, the UK version did not have either. The 3 watt speakers had low volume, which necessitated the use of external speakers. The B305 was described by PC Pro as being suitable for Internet and office tasks, but not for use as a media center. PCMag was more favorable in its review of the desktop. The desktop, which offered an AMD Athlon II X4 2.2 GHz processor, up to 4GB RAM, and ATI Radeon HD 5450 discrete graphics, was described by PCMag as ‚Äúa cut above more basic all-in-one desktops‚Äù. The pros were listed as the compact size, the discrete graphics, multi-touch 1080p HD screen, HDTV tuner, and wall mount. The cons were indicated to be the remote which required an IR dongle, the lack of a Blu-ray reader/writer, the lack of HDTV input besides the TV tuner, and the Microsoft Office 2007 installation, which was a trial only. =B310= The last of the IdeaCentre B Series desktops released in 2010, the B310 could be equipped with Intel Core i3 or i5 processors, up to 4GB RAM, and up to 1TB hard disk drive. The desktop offered ATI Radeon HD 5450 discrete graphics, a 21.5-inch HD screen with an aspect ratio of 16:9 and integrated stereo speakers. The B310 also included touchscreen features, and several software applications from Lenovo which made use of this, including touch games, PowerCinema, VeriGesture, and AutoCollage.

Approximately 15 miles east of Van Horn, FM 2185 turns northward. The highway ends at Smileys Rd. in unincorporated Culberson County. History FM 2185 was established on October 28, 1953 as a 15.0-mile road from its current southern terminus at SH 54 in Van Horn, northeastward to Wild Horse Farming District. On July 11, 1968, the highway was extended approximately 11.5 miles northeastward. It was extended again on October 1 of that year all the way to RM 652, a total of approximately 81.1 miles. On April 30, 1991, FM 2185 was split into two. The central section (from 12.7 miles south of RM 652 to 6.2 miles south of RM 652) was removed from the state highway system and returned to the county for maintenance. On January 26, 2006, at the district's request, the northern section of FM 2185 was designated as FM 3541, and the section from 42.4 miles northeast of SH 54 to 12.7 miles south of RM 652 was removed from the state highway system and returned to the county for maintenance. On August 27, 2020, the deleted portions of FM 2185 were restored, replacing FM 3541 and returning the road to its 81.1 mile length.

Richard and his three siblings were at the centre of a mystery in early-17th-century England that caused early genealogists to wonder why the More children's father, believed to be Samuel More, would send his very young children away to the New World on the Mayflower in the care of others. It was in 1959 that the mystery was explained. Jasper More, a descendant of Samuel More, prompted by his genealogist friend, Sir Anthony Wagner, searched and found in his attic a 1622 document that detailed the legal disputes between Katherine More and Samuel More and what actually happened to the More children. It is clear from these events that Samuel did not believe the children to be his offspring.Anthony R. Wagner. The Origin of the Mayflower Children: Jasper, Richard and Ellen More, (Boston: The New England Historical and Genealogical Register, July 1960), vol. 114, p. 163-168 To rid himself of the children, he arranged for them to be sent to the Colony of Virginia.Donald F Harris, PhD., The More Children of the Mayflower, Part III, The Mayflower Descendant, vol. 44, no. 2 (July 1994), p. 20 Due to bad weather, the Mayflower finally anchored in Cape Cod Harbor in November 1620, where one of the More children died soon after; another died in early December and yet another died later in the first winter. Only Richard survived, and even thrived, in the perilous environment of early colonial America, going on to lead a very full life.William Bradford, History of Plymouth Plantation by William Bradford, the second Governor of Plymouth (Boston: 1856), pp. 450, 451, 447 (Mary was referred to as a boy) Richard became a well-known sea captain who helped to deliver to various colonies the supplies that were vital to their survival, travelled over Atlantic and West Indies trade routes and fought in various early naval sea battles. He and other Mayflower survivors were referred to in their time as \\"First Comers\\", who lived in the perilous times of what was called \\"The Ancient Beginnings\\" of the New World adventure.David Lindsay, Mayflower Bastard: A Stranger amongst the Pilgrims (New York: St. Martins Press, 2002), pp. 45, 151  The More family  Much of what is known about Richard's early childhood is through legal documents, more specifically the aforementioned document written in 1622, in response to a petition of Richard More's mother Katherine More (sometimes spelled Katharine, hereafter spelled Katherine) to Lord Chief Justice Sir James Ley, at which time she demands to know what has become of her children. Katherine's father, Jasper More, was master of Larden, a 1000-acre estate between Much Wenlock and Ludlow in Shropshire. Samuel's father, Richard More, was master of Linley, an estate near Bishop's Castle, close to the Welsh border.Donald F Harris, PhD., The More Children of the Mayflower, Part III, The Mayflower Descendant, vol. 44, no. 2 (July 1994), p. 12 Both estates are in Shropshire, England. Jasper's sons died leaving no male heir.David Lindsay, Mayflower Bastard: A Stranger amongst the Pilgrims (New York: St. Martins Press, 2002), p. 2 The estates were held in an entail whereby inheritance was restricted to male heirs and Samuel's father, but Richard, in the marriage settlement, paid ¬£600 to Jasper More, so there must have been clear title.Donald F. Harris PhD., The More Children of the Mayflower, Part I, The Mayflower Descendant, vol. 43 no. 1, (July 1993), p. 130 It was arranged that Katherine would marry her cousin and indeed, on 4 February 1610, (old date style) Katherine, 25, married her cousin, seventeen- year-old Samuel More.Edwin A. Hill, PhD., The English Ancestry of Richard More of the Mayflower, The New York genealogical and biographical record, (July 1905), vol 36, p. 214Shipton Parish Register Shropshire archive. At some point, Samuel began working in London as secretary to Edward, Lord Zouche, privy councillor, diplomat and courtier.Acts of the Privy Council of England, APC Col. p. 38, show Samuel More in Zouche's service as a private secretary as noted in David Lindsay, Mayflower Bastard: A Stranger amongst the Pilgrims (New York: St. Martins Press, 2002), p.221. Over the next four years, Katherine bore four children: Elinor, Jasper, Richard, Mary. All were baptised at St. James parish church in Shipton, Shropshire, with Samuel More as their father.Anthony R. Wagner, The Origin of the Mayflower Children: Jasper, Richard and Ellen More, (Boston: The New England Historical and Genealogical Register, July 1960), vol. 114, p. 164: Parish Record of the Shipton Shropshire Register Society.  The plan, court action, and removal of the children  In 1616, Samuel More accused his wife of adultery and, at the direction of his father, Richard, devised a plan to rid himself of Katherine and the children. The adultery was supposedly committed with Jacob Blakeway, a young man near in age to Katherine who lived close by and whose family had been More tenants for several generations. In 1608, Jacob Blakeway and his father Edward, a yeoman, had renewed a lease on a parcel of land owned by Katherine More's father, Jasper More of Larden Hall. The manor of Larden Hall was about half a mile from Brockton where the Blakeway family lived. By a deed dated 20 April 1616, Samuel cut the entail on the Larden estate to prevent any of the children from inheriting. During the long court battle, Samuel would deny that he was the father of the children borne by his wife, Katherine, and stated them to be children of the adulterous relationship.Donald F Harris, PhD., The More Children of the Mayflower, Part II, The Mayflower Descendant, vol. 44, no. 1 (January 1994), p. 14, 18 Katherine did not deny her relationship with Jacob Blakeway, stating there was a former betrothal contract with him, and therefore he was her true husband. This would have made her marriage to Samuel invalid. Samuel quotes her words in his declaration, \\"though she could not sufficiently prove by witnesses yet it was all one before god as she sayed\\". At that time any of the usual witnesses would likely have been dead.Anthony R. Wagner, The Origin of the Mayflower Children: Jasper, Richard and Ellen More, (Boston: The New England Historical and Genealogical Register, July 1960), vol. 114, p. 165 In that same year, by his own account, Samuel went to his employer and a More family friend, Lord Zouche, Lord President of the Council of Wales, Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports and Privy Counselor, to draw up a plan for the disposition of the children.Donald F Harris, PhD., The More Children of the Mayflower, Part III, The Mayflower Descendant, vol. 44, no. 2 (July 1994), p. 109 Zouche had been a member of the Virginia Company and in 1617 he invested ¬£100 in an expedition to the Colony of Virginia, which is where the Mayflower was supposed to have landed. It was his actions that were instrumental in putting the More children on the Mayflower.Liza Picard, Elizabeth's London (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2003), p. 196Morison & Commager, The Growth of the American Republic ( 4th Ed., New York, 1950), vol. 1, p.40Donald F Harris, PhD., The More Children of the Mayflower, Part III, The Mayflower Descendant, vol. 44, no. 2 (January 1994), vol. 44, no. 1, p. 14. and (2 July 1994) vol. 44, no. 2, pp. 108‚Äì110 At that time, children were routinely rounded up from the streets of London or taken from poor families receiving church relief to be used as labourers in the colonies. Any legal objections to the involuntary transportation of the children were over-ridden by the Privy Council, namely, Lord Zouche. Most people thought it a death sentence and, indeed, many did not survive either the voyage or the harsh climate, disease, and scarcity of fresh food for which they were ill-prepared.Donald F Harris, PhD., The More Children of the Mayflower, Part III, The Mayflower Descendant, vol. 44, no. 2 (July 1994), pp. 110, 111R.C.

Additionally, in 1616, Samuel More, under his father Richard's direction, removed all four children from Larden and placed them in the care of some of his father's tenants near Linley.Anthony R. Wagner. The Children in the Mayflower (The London Times) 30 June 1959 p. 11 The removal was shortly after the youngest child had been baptised, which was on 16 April. According to Samuel's statement,The More Archive ‚Äì Shropshire Council the reason he sent the children away was \\"as the apparent likeness & resemblance ‚Ä¶ to Jacob Blakeway\\", quoting from: \\"A true declaracon of the disposing of the fower children of Katherine More sett downe by Samuell More her husband\\" together with the \\"reasons movinge him thereunto accasioned by a peticon\\" of hers to the Lord Chief Justice of England and it is endorsed, \\"Katherine Mores Petition to the Lord Chief Justice ...the disposing of her children to Virginia dated 1622\\".Anthony R.

The Origin of the Mayflower Children: Jasper, Richard and Ellen More, (Boston: The New England Historical and Genealogical Register, July 1960), vol. 114, pp. 165‚Äì167 Samuel goes on to state that, during the time the children were with the tenants, Katherine went there and engaged in a struggle to take her children back:David Lindsay, Mayflower Bastard: A Stranger amongst the Pilgrims (New York: St. Martins Press, 2002), p. 13 \\"Katharine went to the tenants dwelling where her children had been sequestered, and in a hail of murderous oaths, did teare the cloathes from their backes\\".

After the Mayflower sailed, Katherine made another attempt to challenge the decision through the courts. It was this legal action in early 1622 before Chief Justice James Ley which led to the statement from Samuel explaining where he sent the children and why, the historical evidence for Richard More's early history.Anthony R. Wagner, The Origin of the Mayflower Children: Jasper, Richard and Ellen More, (Boston: The New England Historical and Genealogical Register, July 1960), vol. 114, p. 164-167  Samuel in the aftermath  Samuel More continued to act as secretary to Edward la Zouche and on 11 June 1625, he married Elizabeth Worsley, daughter of Richard Worsley, Esq. of Deeping Gate (in Maxey) in Northamptonshire and cousin to Lord Zouche's second wife,Donald F Harris, PhD., The More Children of the Mayflower, Part III, The Mayflower Descendant, vol. 44, no. 2 (July 1994), p.110 although he was only separated not divorced from Katherine More and neither party was allowed to remarry during the lifetime of the other.Donald F. Harris, PhD., The Mayflower Descendant(Boston: Massachusetts Society of Mayflower Descendants, January 1994), vol. 44, no. 1, p. 16 In February 1626, Samuel More obtained a royal pardon, possibly to protect himself against accusations of adultery. It is not known if Katherine was still alive at the time of his second marriage.David Lindsay, Mayflower Bastard: A Stranger amongst the Pilgrims (New York: St. Martins Press, 2002), p. 65  Mayflower voyage  Richard More and his siblings departed Plymouth, England on the Mayflower 6 September 1620 (Old Style), dangerously late in the season. They endured a rough three months at sea in cramped and unsanitary conditions, eventually landing at Cape Cod Hook (Provincetown Harbor) on 11 November 1620 (Old Style). A number of colonists travelled as indentured servants on the Mayflower. Exactly what explanation was given for the More children's presence is not known, but many homeless waifs from the streets of London were sent to the New World as labourers.Donald F Harris, PhD., The More Children of the Mayflower, Part I, The Mayflower Descendant, vol. 43, no. 2 (July 1993), vol. 43, no. 2, p.124 The More children were assigned as servants and wards of three adult passengers, as follows: * Elinor More, Ellen More, age 8, assigned as a servant of Edward Winslow. She died in November 1620 soon after the arrival of the Mayflower at Cape Cod Harbor. Her burial place is unknown and may have been ashore on Cape Cod similarly to her brother Jasper several weeks later. With many others who died that winter, her name appears on the Pilgrim Memorial Tomb, Cole's Hill, Plymouth, Massachusetts.William Bradford. History of Plymouth Plantation by William Bradford, the second Governor of Plymouth (Boston: 1856), pp. 447, 451 * Jasper More, age 7, servant of John Carver. He died of a 'common infection' in Dec. 1620 while the Mayflower was in Cape Cod Harbor. He was buried ashore in what is now the Provincetown area. Provincetown has a memorial plaque with his name and that of four others 'who died at sea while the ship lay at Cape Cod Harbor' in Nov./Dec. 1620. * Mary More, age 4, assigned as a servant of William Brewster. She died sometime in the winter of 1620/1621. Her burial place is unknown, but may have been on Cole's Hill in Plymouth in an unmarked grave as with many others buried there that winter. She is mentioned on the Pilgrim Memorial Tomb in Plymouth, misidentified after Ellen's name as \\"and a brother (children)\\" ‚Äì the statement coming from William Bradford's failing memory years after the event of her death. * Richard More, age 6, servant of William Brewster. He resided with the Brewster family until about mid-1627 when his term of indentureship expired.William Bradford, History of Plymouth Plantation by William Bradford, the second Governor of Plymouth (Boston: 1856), p. 447 This is about the time that his name appears, at age 14, in a census as a member of the Brewster family, in what was called then 'New Plimouth'. By 1628, Richard was in the employ of Pilgrim Isaac Allerton, who was engaged in trans-Atlantic trading.David Lindsay, Mayflower Bastard: A Stranger amongst the Pilgrims (New York: St. Martins Press, 2002), pp 102‚Äì104 and pp. 25‚Äì27, 102‚Äì104, 150‚Äì152Nathaniel Philbrick, Mayflower: A story of Courage, Community and War (New York: Viking 2006) p. 26  Richard's life in the New World  Richard was six years old when the Mayflower landed at Plymouth Colony. Immediately upon setting foot on land, he would have worked with all of the others to help gather supplies for food and shelter as well as to bury the dead after the epidemic, which would ultimately leave half of the original passengers dead.William Bradford, History of Plymouth Plantation by William Bradford, the second Governor of Plymouth (Boston: 1856), p. 91 In the spring of 1621, he would have attended what has now become known as the first Thanksgiving.Edward Winslow, \\"Primary Sources for The First Thanksgiving at Plymouth Mourt's Relation. Pilgrim Hall Museum. Retrieved 26 November 2009. In 1627, at the age of 14, Richard is recorded as living at Plymouth Colony.David Lindsay, Mayflower Bastard: A Stranger amongst the Pilgrims (New York: St. Martins Press, 2002), pp. 43‚Äì50. Nothing is known of Richard during his years living with the Brewster family from 1620 to 1627, except that his name is on a document concerning the division of cattle and other livestock, and that he lived in Salem.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620‚Äì1691, (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 180 In 1635 he is listed as arriving from England on the Blessing, which had sailed from London to Massachusetts Bay. The purpose of this journey to London is unknown.Manifest of the Blessing At some point, Richard went to work for Allerton as an apprentice. Under Allerton's apprenticeship, he fished in various locations around Plymouth and Maine, working as crew, and at some point he would become captain of the ships that supplied the new American colonies.David Lindsay, Mayflower Bastard: A Stranger amongst the Pilgrims (New York: St. Martins Press, 2002), p. 73. On 20 April 1636 Richard More married Christian Hunter who had been a passenger with him on the BlessingMarriage to Christian Hunter They lived at Duxbury for a time before moving to Salem.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620‚Äì1691, (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 179 Richard worked as a retainer and a labourer for Richard Hollingsworth, another passenger from the Blessing who was Christian's guardian and step-father.David Lindsay, Mayflower Bastard: A Stranger amongst the Pilgrims (New York: St. Martins Press, 2002), pp. 102, 109 By early 1642, Richard joined the Salem church. As a member, he would be allowed a voice and a vote in Salem affairs. Richard had his first two sons, Samuel and Thomas More, baptised.Richard D. Pierce, The Records of the First Church in Salem Massachusetts, 1629‚Äì1736, p.171 By about 1640s, and by the age of twenty-four, Richard would have been addressed as Captain of his own ketch and is known to have traded with the colonies, the West Indies, and England. He had sold his twenty acres in Duxbury and moved himself and his family to Salem Neck.Robert Charles Anderson, The Great Migration Begins: Immigrants to New England 1620‚Äì1633 Great Migration Study Project. New England Historic Genealogical Society (Boston 1995), vol II., G-O, p. 1284 He applied for a permit and set up his own fishing stand. Since drinking water was scarce, Richard dug a well on common ground for himself and others to use. He traded tobacco and other merchandise and supplies with Virginia and the West Indies, and made voyages to England.David Lindsay, Mayflower Bastard: A Stranger amongst the Pilgrims (New York: St. Martins Press, 2002), pp. 106‚Äì109 In 1653, he served with his ship in an unsuccessful expedition against the Dutch settlement on the Hudson (later to become New York). In 1653, Captain More was paid for ye Dutch expedition.David Lindsay, Mayflower Bastard: A Stranger amongst the Pilgrims (New York: St. Martins Press, 2002), pp. 126‚Äì128 Beginning in 1654, for two consecutive years, he took part in two attacks by sea against the French, who were threatening New England's fishing and maritime trade in the lower Hudson River region. In 1654, Richard More served in a successful combined English and New England expedition against the French at Port Royal, the principal settlement of the French colony of Acadia, now Nova Scotia. Captain More was at Port Royal, Nova Scotia, when the French fort was reduced to English Obedience in 1654, and from thence a bell was later brought to Salem in Capt. Moor's Ketch. Thus Richard More contributed to the foundations of New England's maritime greatness.Robert Moody Sherman, CG, FASG, Robert S. Wakefield, FASG, Lydia Dow Finlay, CALS Mayflower Families Through Five Generations: Family of Richard More (Pub. General Society of Mayflower Descendants 1997), v. 15. p. 152 During this time, Richard received land at Plymouth as an \\"Ancient Freemen\\". The land was granted by the General Court and purchased from the Indians. He obtained lots near the Fall River and was one of the purchasers of lots in Swansea. In 1673, he sold land at Mattapoisett (he is referred to as) he of Massachusetts Colony on 1 March 1667/8; and formerly of Plymouth and now of Salem sold lots in Swansea and Sepecan on 30 August 1673. The Staple Act of 1663, which stated, among other things, that the shipping of European goods to the colonies except through England or Wales was forbidden, forced hard times upon both colonial ship captains and the colonists. The restrictions threatened the very survival of the colonists and, to survive, the captains had to be extremely creative in their shipping manifests.David Lindsay, Mayflower Bastard: A Stranger amongst the Pilgrims, (New York: St. Martins Press, 2002), pp. 152‚Äì157 The Navigation Acts, along with the continued taxation of the colonies into the next century, brought about the growth of isolationism, which eventually resulted in the American Revolution.L. Carroll Judson, Sages and Heroes of the American Revolution (Philadelphis: Moss & Brother 1854), In 1665, Richard rescued the colonists at the newly established colony at Cape Fear. The ship that was supposed to bring supplies failed to arrive and, consequently, the people were dying of starvation and the lack of adequate protection against the weather. It was an extremely hazardous area for ships but, upon learning of the situation, Richard brought a shipment of food and supplies to aid the desperate colonists.Robert Charles Anderson, The Great Migration Immigrants to New England, 1634‚Äì1635(FASG Published 1995) When Richard's old sailing friend, Richard Starr, was murdered, he took on the responsibility of Starr's three children. In his fifty years as a mariner Richard had never lost a vessel, nor had any sailor brought charges against him.David Lindsay, Mayflower Bastard: A Stranger amongst the Pilgrims (New York: St. Martins Press, 2002), Preface, pp. xxi, xx, 22, 154 Capt. Richard More memorial near his grave in Salem, Massachusetts Richard served alongside Joseph Dudley during the Great Swamp Fight in December 1675, a massacre of the Narragansett people living around Narragansett Bay. Reverend Nicholas Noyes was a man whom Richard knew well and would become directly involved with in his later life. Noyes was the same man who would lead the campaign against the so-called witches of Salem.David Lindsay, Mayflower Bastard: A Stranger amongst the Pilgrims (New York: St. Martins Press, 2002), p 205-206 In later life, Richard suffered from financial hardship. On 1 July 1688, he was brought before the Salem church elders for 'gross unchastity with another man's wife'.Richard D. Pierce, The Records of the First Church in Salem Massachusetts, 1629‚Äì1736 , p.171 The elders had spoken to him privately on several occasions as Richard represented a member of the Ancient Days and they wanted to maintain a special place in their history. He was publicly sanctioned and excommunicated from the church. Richard accepted the judgment and made a public repentance and, according to documents, was restored to the church in 1691. According to David Lindsay, historian and author, the pastor who punished him was Reverend Nicholas Noyes.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620‚Äì1691, (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 329David Lindsay, Mayflower Bastard: A Stranger amongst the Pilgrims (New York: St. Martins Press, 2002), Introduction, also pp 190‚Äì192. Richard More is buried in Salem. There is documentary evidence that he was alive in 1694 and dead in 1696.Donald F Harris, PhD., The More Children of the Mayflower Parts I‚ÄìIII vol. 43, July 1993, and vol. 44 (January & July 1994). His gravestone gives an age of 84, but he deposed in 1684 that he was indicating he was unsure of his birth date. The gravestone in the old Salem burial ground gives a date of 1692.  Marriages  Richard More married three times: * Christian Hunter on 20 October 1636 in Plymouth Colony. She was born ca. 1615 in possibly Southwold, co. Suffolk, England, and was baptised there on 13 August 1615 at (possibly) the parish church of The Church of St. Edmund, King and Martyr. She died on 18 March 1676 in Salem, Massachusetts. Her parents were Thomas Hunter (d.1623/7) and Susan Gentleman. She came to America in 1635 on the ship Blessing with her mother and step-father Richard Hollingsworth.David Lindsay, Mayflower Bastard: A Stranger amongst the Pilgrims (New York: St. Martins Press, 2002), pp 92, 229(n19) & TAG Vol. 78, No. 4, October 2003 * Elizabeth Woolnough on 23 October 1645 in St. Dunstan's church, Stepney parish, London. The record of that event notes that \\"Richard Moore of Salem, Mariner\\" married Elizabeth Woolnough of Limehouse district, London. The Stepney parish register states that Elizabeth was the daughter of Benjamin Woolnough, having been baptised in St. Dunstan's on 21 December 1623. Benjamin Woolnough was a trans- Atlantic ship captain, sailing to Virginia. The last time that Elizabeth's name appears on documents is on 7 April 1646, the day after Richard More failed to appear at the Kings Session for Peace, when she identified herself to the High Court of Admiralty as \\"Elizabeth, wife of Richard Moore of Stepney.\\" Her appearance in court was to answer a charge against More, who had probably fled the country, for being intoxicated in the company of a woman of easy virtue as well as a child of about eight years, thought to have been his daughter Elizabeth. There is no evidence that Elizabeth Woolnough ever came to America. No further record.David Lindsay, Mayflower Bastard: A Stranger amongst the Pilgrims (New York: St. Martins Press, 2002), pp. 102, 104, 123, 124, 150 * Jane Hollingsworth Crumpton. Born c. 1631.

Richard More and Elizabeth Woolnough had one daughter: *Elizabeth More, born ca. 1638 in probably London, about 7‚Äì8 years prior to her parents' marriage in 1645. She was baptised at St. Dunstan's Church, Stepney parish, London on 2 March 1646, five months after her parents' marriage in 1645. Nothing more is known about her other than a record of an \\"Elizabeth More\\", of about her age, appearing briefly in Salem about 1660, and marrying a local shipwright named Richard Clarke. They soon after moved to Long Island where they appeared at Southampton, Long Island in 1661, as husband and wife.David Lindsay, Mayflower Bastard: A Stranger amongst the Pilgrims (New York: St. Martins Press, 2002), pp. 104, 122, 150, 230, 229  Death and burial  thumbnail Gravestone of Christian Hunter More, wife of Richard More, Salem MA. According to the Mayflower Society records, he died in Salem after 19 March 1693/4, but before 20 April 1696. There is documentary evidence that he was alive in 1694 and dead in 1696. His gravestone gives an age of 84, but it is more likely that Richard was unsure of his birth date. The gravestone in the old Salem burial ground gives a date of 1692. But the date, and additional words 'a Mayflower pilgrim', were added at some point between 1901 and 1919, and provoked some outraged reaction in the local press.Donald F Harris, PhD., The More Children of the Mayflower, Part I, The Mayflower Descendant, vol. 43, no. 2 (July 1993)(quoting from Mayflower Quarterly of Feb. 1972) Richard More is buried in what was known as the Charter Street Burial Ground but is now the Burying Point/Charter Street Cemetery in Salem, Massachusetts. He is the only Mayflower passenger to have his gravestone still where it was originally placed sometime in the mid-1690s. Also buried nearby in the same cemetery were his two wives, Christian Hunter More and Jane (Crumpton) More.Richard More, (Mayflower passenger) If the 1696 date is correct, Richard More was the last surviving male passenger of the Mayflower, which would have left Mary Allerton, daughter of Pilgrim Isaac Allerton, as the last survivor altogether.

The document was a sworn submission by Samuel More to the Lord Chief Justice in which he explained his disposition of the four More children. Previously, those four children were assumed to have been orphans, plucked from the streets of London: \\"homeless waifs from the streets of London taken out to the New World to be used as labor\\".Donald F Harris, PhD., The More Children of the Mayflower, Part I, The Mayflower Descendant, vol. 43, no. 2 (July 1993), p. 124 This document revealed the tragic family circumstances that caused Samuel More to take the children from their home at Larden Hall in Shipton, and send them away to America on the Mayflower without their mother's knowledge or consent.Donald F Harris, PhD., The More Children of the Mayflower, Part II, The Mayflower Descendant, vol. 44, no. 1 (January 1994), p. 11 Richard's daughter, Susanna (More), first married Samuel Dutch in about 1675.

The definition has also been extended to include the common structure, principles and practices necessary to drive the organization. Diversified industrial companies like Ingersoll Rand, Honeywell, and Danaher have adopted a standard, common collection of business processes and/or business process improvement methodologies which they use to manage strategy development and execution. In the case of Danaher, the business system is a core part of the company's culture, is seen as one of the key drivers of corporate performance, and is therefore a differentiator for shareholders and prospective employees. The objectives of such systems are to ensure daily work is focused on the organisation's strategic objectives and is done in the most efficient way. The systems deal with the questions \\"why\\" (purpose of the work), \\"what\\" (specific objectives of the work) and \\"how\\" (the processes used to do the work). The Toyota Production System is focused on both how to make cars, and how to improve the way cars are made. A third objective can also be added, which is to improve the business system itself by identifying or improving the component tools and techniques.  Terminology  Terms used to describe such systems include: * XPS - meaning ‚ÄúCompany-specific Production System\\" with the X standing in place of the company name * Business System * Management Operating System  Examples of business operating systems  * Toyota's Toyota Production System (TPS) is one of the earliest examples, developed between 1948 and 1975 * Danaher is well known for its Danaher Business System (DBS)http://www.danaher.com/how-we-work/danaher-business- system * Fortive (a company that split from Danaher in 2016) has the Fortive Business System (FBS) which is derived from the DBShttp://www.fortive.com/fortive-business-system * Ingersoll Rand established the Ingersoll Rand business operating system (BOS) to describe the six enterprise focus areas and its process improvement method (Lean Six Sigma). * Honeywell has the Honeywell Operating System (HOS) * United Technologies has the Achieving Competitive Excellence (ACE) Operating System https://www.utc.com/en/Our-Company/our-operating-system * Idex Corporation has the Idex Operating Model http://www.idexcorp.com/about/about_strategy.asp * ETW (Execute to Win) * Bosch Production System * Boeing Production System * Audi Production System * Lego Production System * John Deere Quality and Production System * Alcoa Business System * REC Production System * Electrolux Manufacturing System * Novo Nordisk - \\"cLEAN‚Äù * Trumpf - ‚ÄúSynchro‚Äù * Magellan Operating System (Magellan Aerospace) * Americold has the \\"Americold Operating System\\" (AOS) http://www.americold.com/about-us/americold-operating-system/  List of common features  Many of business operating systems share common features. This is because the systems are derived from other known systems, and from established methods and practices for business management. The following is a list of features that appear in several systems. * Hoshin Kanri, a strategic planning methodology developed by Yoji Akao, used to create goals, assign them measurable milestones, and assess progress against those milestones (Hoshin Kanri is also referred to as Policy Deployment or X-Matrix) * Standard work - the best and most reliable methods and sequences for each work process which is used as the basis for sustaining improvements * Process improvement methodologies: Lean, Six Sigma, and Kaizen are popular approaches incorporated in business systems * Just-in-time manufacturing * Gemba walks * Jidoka - \\"automation with a human touch\\" where human intervention is used to improve machine performance * Visual controls or visual management where management processes (e.g. checking) use simple graphics to show problems at a glance * Problem solving techniques such as root cause analysis * Technology: While these standard business operating systems may inform or be linked to a company's technology platform, they more commonly refer to the way the company manages complex business processes in a common way across its diverse portfolio of businesses.

The article deals with the series' main, recurring and guest stars. Main cast =Jimmy Chance= James Bon Jovi Chance, commomly known as \\"Jimmy\\", played by Lucas Neff, Hope's father. A good-natured, wide-eyed 23-year-old who is clueless about raising a child and everything else. He met and had a one- night stand with Lucy Carlyle, resulting in her pregnancy and the birth of Hope. He did not know Carlyle was a serial killer until the next morning and had no idea she was pregnant with Hope until seven months later when Lucy contacted him. He works for his father's landscaping and pool cleaning business, and later gets a second job as a bagger at Howdy's, an Old West themed grocery store, where he meets his future wife, Sabrina Collins. Jimmy is harmless and kindhearted, but dimwitted, which is implied to be a result of his parents' inept care. He is a talented artist and in Season 2 Episode 1, it was revealed that he used to have musical talent when he was young (Teen singer Greyson Chance played 13-year old Jimmy in the episode \\"Prodigy\\") . When he was a teenager, he went through a phase where he dressed like a goth, and it is revealed that Sabrina was attracted to his \\"Drakar Noire\\" personality. In Season 3, he marries Sabrina and moves in with her. Five-year old Jimmy is played by Trace!, Greg Garcia's son. =Virginia Chance= Virginia Slims Chance played by Martha Plimpton. Hope's paternal grandmother, Jimmy's mother, and Burt's wife. She is sarcastic and frequently utters malaprops. When she was younger, she had a scoliosis and had to wear a back brace, but she claims that having sex with Burt cured her of it. Virginia conceived Jimmy when she was fifteen (he was born on prom night). Her mother wanted to be a swinger and left her when she was two years old, leaving her to be raised by her grandmother, Maw Maw, who told Virginia that her mother had died when she'd fallen and hit her head on a lawn ornament in the form of a duck. In the pilot, she is shown chainsmoking, but she quits in the second episode and gives Jimmy her cigarette money to pay for Hope's daycare. Virginia works as a housecleaner in upper middle/upper-class houses. For her performance as Virginia in the first season, Martha Plimpton was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series. Teenage Virginia is played by Kelly Heyer. =Burt Chance= Burt Jebbidiah Chance played by Garret Dillahunt. Hope's paternal grandfather, Jimmy's father, and Virginia's husband. Burt conceived Jimmy with Virginia when he was seventeen. He is dimwitted, with flights of fancy and delusions of grandeur, but very kindhearted. He is a recovered gambling-addict and he runs a lawn care/pool cleaning business with Jimmy as his assistant, working shirtless to get more tips from the bored middle-aged housewives watching. As a teenager, he wanted to be a rockstar, and he is often shown playing his guitar, performing several songs throughout the series and fulfilling a lifelong dream by playing alongside washed up rock star Smokey Floyd in the episode \\"Burt Rocks\\", later bashing Floyd over the head for verbally abusing his granddaughter (becoming a minor celebrity in the process). =Hope Chance= Played by identical twins Baylie and Rylie Cregut, Hope Chance (born Princess Beyonce Carlyle), Jimmy and Lucy's daughter, Virginia and Burt's granddaughter and Maw Maw's great-great-granddaughter. Hope was conceived in Jimmy's van when he went out to get bubblegum ice cream and met a distressed Lucy Carlyle with whom he had a one-night stand. Hope is shown to be very intelligent, which she likely gets from her mother, as she was able to figure out a shape- sorter toy when she was two (Jimmy wasn't able to do it even when he was four) and pass a GED test by randomly filling in the dots. At one point, she scared her family by showing violent tendencies that made them think she was going to become a serial killer like her biological mother; but they realized that Lucy was a serial killer because she suppressed her anger and let it out drastically by killing. They subsequently decide that if they let Hope release her anger normally, she'd be just fine. =Sabrina Collins= Sabrina Collins played by Shannon Woodward, Jimmy's co-worker at Howdy's despite coming from a rich family. She spends most of her time drawing on cantaloupes and mixing up the cereals and soup cans. In Season 1, Sabrina immediately catches Jimmy's attention, but she has a boyfriend, Wyatt, who is studying Finance in New York. In the season two episode, Jimmy's Fake Girlfriend, she breaks up with Wyatt after realizing how selfish he is, and starts dating Jimmy. In season three, she marries Jimmy and they move into her grandmother's old house. In Squeak means Squeak, she reveals that she is worried about her ability to be a parent to Hope, but after Hope calls her \\"mommy\\", she becomes more confident in herself.

Virginia's 84-year-old grandmother, Jimmy's great-grandmother, and Hope's great-great-grandmother, who owns the American Craftsman house at 3300 Bradley Avenue where the Chances all live. Maw Maw appears to have dementia and has only short-lived moments of lucidity in which she can be very helpful or very angry about the entire family living in her house.

He was a recurring character for the first season and got promoted to main cast for the rest of the series. Recurring cast =Shelley= Shelley (Kate Micucci) is Sabrina's cousin. Shelley had previously made out with Jimmy during a party. Two years later, Shelley reappears after Jimmy needs a babysitter. Shelley is positive that Jimmy loves her and they start a relationship, which is ended by Jimmy when he reveals his feelings for Sabrina to her. She used to have a \\"dead tooth\\" (a brown and decaying front tooth) she kept as a conversation starter, but had it fixed out of fear of being made fun of. Shelley runs a daycare center for children, dogs, and senior citizens, for whom she frequently plays the ukulele and composes songs. In the episode \\"Mongooses,\\" she is seen repeatedly turning her light switch on and off forty-five times, believing she must do so \\"to stay alive\\". As Hope's babysitter, they grow a strong bond. In season 2 episode 20, Shelley is the first name Hope says, to Sabrina's annoyance. In season 4, Frank professed his love for her and the two started a relationship. Appeared in: 26 episodes =Frank Marolla= Frank (Todd Giebenhain) is a creepy and incompetent co-worker at the store where Jimmy and Sabrina work.

It was revealed in season 2's The Men of New Natesville, that he shared the same bully as Jimmy in high school, and the two of them bond over the fact. Since then, he has largely displaced Javier and Marcus as Jimmy's best male friend. In season 3, he and Jimmy were married, but later got an annulment in the episode ‚ÄúWhat Happens at Howdy's Doesn't Stay at Howdy's‚Äù.

He worked for Burt's gardening business before leaving with a girl to join a cult. In \\"The Cultish Personality\\", Mike returns with his wife Tanya (Mary Lynn Rajskub) and \\"brother-husbands\\" Jeff (Paul F. Tompkins), Rodney (Chris Frontiero) and Chester (Kent Avenido). It is revealed that his father (Burt's brother) Bruce (J.K. Simmons) had kicked him out of the house, and Burt had taken him in. After being falsely accused by Burt of kidnapping Hope (Burt's attempt to get Mike out of the cult and back with his father), Mike reunites with his father and joins the family mattress business. In the pilot, Stone was credited as a main character, but by the second episode, he was written out. Appeared in: 4 episodes =Sylvia and Donovan= Sylvia and Donovan (Tichina Arnold and Phill Lewis) are rich friends of Burt and Virginia's. They first met the Chance family when Jimmy attempted to make friends with their son, although they had already known Virginia through her cleaning their house.

Sabrina and Wyatt break up when Jimmy and his (fake) girlfriend take them on a double date, which reveals Wyatt's selfishness to Sabrina. Appeared in: 8 episodes =Lucy Carlyle= Lucy Carlyle (Bijou Phillips) is Hope's biological mother. She is a serial killer who has killed several of her boyfriends after inadvertent influence provided by Shelly (who merely said she should \\"get rid of\\" her boyfriend, but Lucy took the advice out of context and thought she meant kill him). She met Jimmy after trying to escape her latest murder attempt. She then seduces him and becomes pregnant with Hope. Soon afterward, the Chances learn who Lucy really is and turn her in to the police. Eight months later, Lucy contacts Jimmy and reveals that she is pregnant with Jimmy's baby. After delivering a daughter she originally names \\"Princess Beyonc√©\\", Lucy is sentenced to death by electric chair. In one of the later episodes, Jimmy, Burt, and Virginia receive the memoir Lucy left Hope, which includes a video about how to survive in prison and \\"how to attract a man\\". In the first part of the season 2 finale, it is revealed that Jimmy married Lucy in prison, and that Lucy is not dead after all. In the second part, Lucy arrives at the Chance's house and says that if Jimmy and Hope don't move to Tibet with her she will fight for sole custody of their daughter. Lucy's lawyer wins the case and Lucy gets Hope. Sabrina understands that, although Jimmy loves her, he loves his child and it would be wrong to keep him from Hope, and so tearfully agrees that he should go with Lucy. On the way to the airport they pass Sabrina and Jimmy stares out of the car window at her, leading Lucy to stop the car and ask him if he really does love Sabrina, to which he replies yes. Lucy then gets out of the car and chases after Sabrina with a knife; but before she can kill her, she is run over by a blind Carl driving Smokey Floyd's tour bus. Jimmy then gets Hope back and the Chances go back to their ordinary lives. She did not appear until season three again when the death certificate was needed to make Jimmy and Sabrina's wedding certificate official. So when Virginia and Burt go to get it from her dad, she attacks them and is shocked by an electric collar, revealed to still be alive. In Greg Garcia's original pilot script of the series, Lucy is not killed by the electric chair due to loose wires. After the failed execution, she argues with the warden that a second attempt to kill her would be considered barbaric, comparing it to the case of Willie Francis. She mentions that the case eventually went to the Supreme Court, and while they ruled against him five votes to four, she states that that was before female judges, lamenting that \\"No way Ginsburg and Sotomayor let me fry try twice\\". Believing that God \\"saved\\" her \\"for a reason\\", she also demands Jimmy to return Hope to her. However, Jimmy ultimately decides against it. It is implied at the end of the script that the character was to become a recurring antagonist, as the headline of a newspaper reads \\"Execution botched. Lawyers vow to get client released\\".http://www.zen134237.zen.co.uk/Raising_Hope/Raising_Hope_1x01_-_Pilot.pdf Elements of the original script were reused when Lucy was revealed to be alive in the season 2 finale.

He was the eldest child of the 3rd Baron Methuen and his second wife, Mary Ethel. Life Paul Ayshford Methuen was born at Corsham, Wiltshire, on 29 September 1886. He was the first of the five children of Field Marshal Paul Sanford Methuen, 3rd Baron Methuen of Corsham, and his second wife, Mary Ethel n√©e Sanford. He was educated at Eton and New College, Oxford, where he studied zoology and engineering. From 1910 to 1914 he worked in the Transvaal Museum in Pretoria, where he published several scientific papers with the South African herpetologist, John Hewitt, with whom he collected and described a number of southern African and Madagascan genera and species in the early 20th century. He later refused a chair in zoology at a South African university because of his commitment to his ancestral home. In the First World War he served with the Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry and then with his father's regiment, the Scots Guards. Afterwards he worked at Ministry of Agriculture (where his experience in slaughterhouses made him a lifelong vegetarian) until succeeding his father in 1932. He married Eleanor Hennessy, daughter of the landscape painter William James Hennessy, in 1915. Methuen had studied drawing at Eton, at the Ruskin in Oxford, and with Charles Holmes. In 1927 he attended art classes given by Walter Sickert, which had a permanent effect on his painting style. He established a reputation as a serious artist. His preferred subjects were urban views and outdoor scenes with buildings, animals, and plants, such as the magnolias and orchids he grew at Corsham Court. In 1939 he rejoined his regiment and served as a captain until 1944 when he was moved to the Procurement and Fine Art branch set up to protect works of art during the invasion of the continent. He later recounted his experiences in his book Normandy Diary. During the War, Methuen also received a number of commissions from the War Artists' Advisory Committee, mainly for scenes painted in the London dockyards. Methuen spent much of his later years in restoration work on his family seat, Corsham Court, and in restoring and expanding the art collection in its fine 18th-century Picture Gallery, designed by Capability Brown. Where possible, he bought back pictures that had been sold by his father. He published a history of the collection in 1958, and a catalogue of the miniatures in 1970. Four years after the destruction of the premises of the Bath School of Art in 1942, Methuen offered Corsham Court, which during the war had been first the temporary home of Westonbirt School and then a convalescent hospital for officers, to the new Bath Academy of Art under Clifford Ellis. It remained there until 1972; Corsham Court is now used by Bath Spa University. From 1939 to 1971, Methuen was president of the Royal West of England Academy in Bristol.The date of his presidency is often referred to as 1940-67 - at times even by the RWA themselves. 1939-71 is the date given on both of his busts by Ernest Pascoe: RWA Collection number: BRSRW.0597 and RWA Collection number: BRSRW.1791. He was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1951, and became a Royal Academician in 1959. He was also elected an Honorary Associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects (Hon ARIBA) in 1947Tate website reference to Mary Chamot, Dennis Farr, Martin Butlin, The Modern British Paintings, Drawings and Sculpture, London 1964, II. and a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1951. He was a trustee of both the National Gallery, from 1938 to 1945, and of the Tate Gallery, from 1940 to 1945. Paul Ayshford Methuen died on 7 January 1974 in Bath. His only son having died at birth, the title passed to his younger brother Anthony. Legacy A species of South African lizard, Lygodactylus methueni, is named in honor of Paul Ayshford Methuen.

Usually volume manufacturers provide a European Community Whole Vehicle Type Approval (ECWVTA) whilst niche makers can use the European Union Small Series Type Approval (ECSSTA) that allows registration in any EC country (although local modification may be required. Different local rules apply in different EC countries: for example most of Europe drives on the right, so headlights must dip right, but the reverse is true for the United Kingdom and Ireland. However an incomplete vehicle such as the EVTraxer would not qualify for either of these general schemes and so would require Individual Vehicle Approval in each country of registration (i.e. each individual owners' domicile or tax residence address) although if that IVA-based registration and vehicle taxation was effective within any EC country the vehicle could then be driven anywhere in Europe.

It released the first significant historical, Sairandhari, released in Pune 7 February 1920. In the coming decade the only other major company was Dada Saheb Phalke's Hindustan Film Company. It made numerous films till the advent of talkies in 1931, but started collapsing after V. Shantaram left in 1929, to form Prabhat Film Company, it finally closed down in 1931. History Vishnupant Damle was trusted lieutenant of Baburao Painter in his Maharashtra film Company, Kolhapur. The company had made a name for itself with its silent films in early 1920s. Baburao Painter made many silent movies till 1930 however after a few more silent films, the Maharashtra Film Company pulled down its shutters with the advent of sound. Baburao was not particularly keen on the talkies for he believed that they would destroy the visual culture so painfully evolved over the years. Baburao Painter's associates, V Shantaram, Keshavrao Dhaibar, and close friends Vishnupant Damle and Fateh Lal (Damle Mama and Saheb Mama) held senior posts at the company.
