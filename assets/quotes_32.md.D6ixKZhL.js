It is predominantly practiced by the Ndebele women when painting homes.  History  During the 18th century, the Ndzundza Ndebele people of South Africa created their own tradition and style of house painting. Until the late 1900s, the Ndebele noted warriors and large landowners. In the autumn of 1883, they went to war with the neighboring Boers. The loss of the war brought on a harsh life and horrible punishments for the Ndebele. Through those hard times expressive symbols were generated by the suffering people expressing their grief. These symbols were the beginning of the African the art form. The Ndebele tribe originally in the early 18th century lived in grass huts. They began using mud-walled houses in the mid-18th century when these symbols begin to be created on their houses and walls. These expressive symbols were used for communication between sub-groups of the Ndebele people. They stood for their continuity and cultural resistance to their circumstances. The Boer farmers did not understand the meaning and viewed it as cultural art that was not harmful, so it was allowed to continue. These wall paintings done by the women was their secret code to their people, disguised to anyone but the Ndebele. The vibrant symbols and expressions portray communications of personal prayers, self-identification, values, emotions, and marriage. Sometimes the male initiation, known as the wela, was a reason for repainting, but the ritual was not expressed. One quality of life that has never been expressed or directed through their walls is sacred expression. The rituals and religions have never been a part of the Ndebele's house paintings. The women of the Ndebele are often the tradition carriers and the main developer of the wall art of their home. The tradition and style of house painting is passed down in the families from generation to generation by the mothers. A well-painted home shows the female of the household is a good wife and mother. She is responsible for the painting of the outside gates, front walls, side walls, and usually the interior of her home. One thing that has changed since the beginning of the house painting and the present-day wall art is their styles. In the beginning of house painting their symbols and patterns were often based from Ndebele's beadwork. The patterns were tonal and painted with the women's fingers. The original paint on the house was a limestone whitewash. The colors added to make the paintings were mostly natural pigments consisting of browns, blacks, and ochers. Most of the patterns were of a V shape and a very simple triangle on a large shape of color. The patterns, earth tones, directions, and sizes were more important than the present-day vivid and bright colors.  Colors  Over time, the colors and shape became a key aspect in the overall design. In the late 1968s, the new style was evident. What was once a finger-painted creation was now created using bundled twigs with feathers as brushes. The walls are still originally whitewashed, but the outlines and colours have significantly changed. The patterns and symbols can be seen today with a rich black outline and a vivid colour inside. There are five main colours represented: red and dark red, yellow to gold, a sky blue, green, and sometimes pink. The colours give an intensified symbolic meaning to the Ndebele. They can mean status or power of the home's owners, offer prayer, announce a marriage in the home, or can represent a current protest. The paintings express an abstract meaning with no real. This is the most direct way to show their individual expression to the people outside their far distinct family, showing of the talent and the taste of the mother. The colour white is always used as the background because it makes the bright patterns stand out more.  Patterns  The pink patterns are one of the most important aspects in their communication through painting. They are usually repeated throughout their design with only a very slight variation and different color choice. The geometric patterns and shape are first drawn with the black outline and later filled in with color. The patterns are grouped together throughout the walls in terms of their basic design structure. Creating the right tools to allow accuracy and freedom becomes a difficult task. The tools can't restrict the painter from creating her art. They have to have tools for the large geometric shapes of flat color and small brushes for the very small areas, outlines, and sacks. The advancement of tools has allowed faster and more complex designs throughout the Ndebele's homes. These very simple-looking painted houses are really a complex system of tradition and creation. This painted tradition is still alive. As every generation passes it down little changes begin to exist. This is their way of communication and expression through their home. The women work long and hard to finish these walls and are noticed by the outside community because of their talent and expression.

It totals and is located northwest of Mitchell, Oregon. The Painted Hills are listed as one of the Seven Wonders of Oregon. Painted Hills is named after the colorful layers of its hills corresponding to various geological eras, formed when the area was an ancient river floodplain.  Geology  The Hills' colors originate from 35 million years ago, when this area was an ancient river floodplain. The colored bands are due to changes in climate that occurred as they were distributed through time. As the climate changed to a more tropical setting with distinct wet and dry seasons, reddish and yellowish layers formed that are made up of laterites, soils rich in iron and aluminum. Red soils come from a more tropical period, while the yellows are from a drier and cooler time. The red coloring is laterite soil that formed by floodplain deposits when the area was warm and humid. The darker, black soil is lignite that was vegetative matter that grew along the floodplain. The grey coloring is mudstone, siltstone, and shale. An abundance of fossil remains of early horses, camels, and rhinoceroses in the Painted Hills unit makes the area particularly important to vertebrate paleontologists.  Recreation  The Painted Hills are listed as one of the Seven Wonders of Oregon. The Painted Hills unit is open year-round with access for all visitors, but recreation can take a toll on the landscape; visitors who step off the trails can disrupt the naturally-occurring mineral layers, and damage the hills' visible features. There are several well-marked trails for visitors, who are encouraged to take a pledge to stay on the trails at all times: 'Don't Hurt the Dirt', and 'Leave No Trace'. In 2015, the annual visitor count at the Painted Hills rose from 45,849 to 74,873.

Synopsis Dr Conway must deal with an unconscious patient, classification ELPH, who may be a cannibal or a demigod, or both. It came from the \\"other galaxy\\", and the species is well known, almost infamous, to the Ians, who are also from another galaxy. It is extremely long-lived, and regularly takes complete rejuvenation treatments, including the brain and memory, to keep itself young. By doing this, it is practically immortal. It, although unconscious, appeared to have the ability to negate the most powerful drugs and resist surgery to cure its skin condition. This later turned out to be the work of the entity's \\"doctor\\", who is an intelligent, organised collection of microscopic, virus-type cells. Once Doctor Conway realises this, he uses a wooden stake to make the ELPH's doctor focus itself in one small location, at which time it is removed from the ELPH, informed regarding the physiology-problems of its patient, and put back in. The patient, whose name is Lonvellin, quickly makes a full recovery, and it leaves to do what it does best: bona fide missions that involve taking backwards planetary cultures and pulling them up \\"by their bootstraps\\". His particular mission, this time, is to cure a diseased planet called Etla, and he recruits Dr Conway and the \\"Monitor Corps\\" to help him. When the empire that controls the planet of Etla misinterprets Lonvellin's efforts as an act of war, the empire declares war on the Sector General space hospital. Conway helps organise the evacuation of most of the station's staff and patients, and following the death or injury of more senior staff, becomes the most senior surviving physician. After a brutal series of attacks, and with the hospital on the brink of defeat, a group of Federation and Empire soldiers convince Conway to help in a mutiny against the Federation commander Dermod. The Empire soldiers had been told that the Federation had attacked Etla, rather than trying to help it, but seeing the way all casualties were treated equally on the station, and in particular witnessing Conway breaking down after failing to save the life of an alien Empire soldier, convinced them that they had been lied to.

Junior wears a white singlet with a red letter \\"J\\" on it. His objective in the game is to save his father, who was locked by Mario in a cage. He returns in the 1994 Game Boy video game Donkey Kong, where he teams up with his father, who has kidnapped Pauline, against Mario. Junior also appeared as a playable character in Super Mario Kart, but he was absent in later installments until he returned in the Super Mario Kart tour in Mario Kart Tour, he also appeared in the Virtual Boy game Mario's Tennis, and as a hidden character in the Nintendo 64 version of the similarly named Mario Tennis. He also has his own educational video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System: Donkey Kong Jr. Math. Other appearances by Junior includes the Game & Watch games Donkey Kong Jr. (in wide-screen, tabletop and panorama versions) and Donkey Kong II, as well as the Game & Watch Gallery series compilations for Game Boy. He also appears as the physical appearance of the transformed king of World 4 in the Super NES and Game Boy Advance versions of Super Mario Bros. 3. Donkey Kong Junior had his own segment in the first season of Saturday Supercade and was voiced by Frank Welker. Like his father, he had his own cereal brand in the 1980s. According to Rare, the developers of Donkey Kong Country, there are multiple Donkey Kongs, shortly before the release of Donkey Kong 64 in 1999, Leigh Loveday claimed that \\"as far as he knew\\", the modern one who appears in Donkey Kong Country onward is theoretically a grown-up version of Junior himself. However, the manual for Donkey Kong Country, Donkey Kong Land, Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest, stated that Cranky is the original Donkey Kong and is the grandfather of the game's titular character. More recently, Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Donkey Kong Country Returns, Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze and Gregg Mayles of Rare have stated that the current Donkey Kong is the original Donkey Kong's grandson, implying that Junior is actually the current Donkey Kong's father.\\"I'm pretty sure when I made this stuff up nearly 25 years ago that he was his grandson. By DK64 he was so senile that he couldn't remember - Gregg Mayles of Rareware on Twitter\\"Super Mario Kart is the only Mario Kart game to feature Donkey Kong Jr. Due to the success of Donkey Kong Country, all future Mario Kart entries featured Donkey Kong, who is actually Donkey Kong Jr.‚Äôs son, with Cranky Kong, aka Donkey Kong Sr., canonically being the character featured in the original Donkey Kong game. Makes sense, right?\\" - Playing With Super Power: Nintendo Super NES Classics eGuide, Super Mario Kart 16 Bits Tab. The character Diddy Kong was going to be an updated version of Donkey Kong Junior. However, Nintendo did not like this idea, suggesting either to give him his old look or make him a new character. Rare chose the latter and Diddy Kong was made.Retro Gamer, The Making of Donkey Kong Country, p. 69, Vol. #43 =Diddy Kong= Diddy Kong, also known as Diddy, is a young male monkey or spider monkey\\"I think we actually 'penciled him in' as a Spider Monkey because we wanted the tail to be his main tool when climbing around. - Diddy Kong designer Kevin Bayliss of Rareware on Twitter, the secondary main protagonist of the Donkey Kong franchise, Donkey Kong's sidekick and nephew.\\"Long-established second half of the Kong double act. DK's nephew Diddy makes ever-bigger leaps and bounds towards fully fledged videogame hero status with his part in each successful overthrow of K. Rool's hordes. - DK64 Cast List Official Rareware Website His first appearance was Donkey Kong Country. In the game's storyline, Donkey Kong requested for him to protect their Banana Hoard overnight, while he takes a nap. While guarding the bananas, Diddy was captured by the Kremlings and sealed afterwards. When Donkey Kong heard the news, he set off on his adventure, freed Diddy, and they both confronted King K. Rool. The duo managed to defeat him, and recover their stolen bananas along the way. In Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest, Donkey Kong gets kidnapped by Kaptain K. Rool, and Diddy must team up with Dixie Kong to save him. After rescuing DK and defeating K. Rool, he retreats to his secret island, the Lost World. The Kongs defeat K. Rool a second time, and he gets stuck in Crocodile Isle's generator, which explodes. The Kongs escaped the island and witnessed its destruction. Later on, both Diddy and DK get kidnapped in Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!, and the newly named Baron K. Roolenstein uses them as a power source for KAOS, a giant robot to spy on Dixie and Kiddy Kong's adventure in rescuing the apes. Diddy and Donkey Kong are eventually freed by Dixie and Kiddy. Years after his defeat, King K. Rool returns in Donkey Kong 64; he gets his minions to imprison Donkey Kong's friends, with Diddy being one of them. He attempts to steal the Banana Hoard again. As soon as Diddy is freed from his imprisonment, he can collect red bananas, red coins, play his electric guitar, charge at foes or objects, fly in his barrel jet pack, and shoot peanuts from his guns. Diddy Kong also appeared in Donkey Kong Country Returns, its 3DS remake and Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze. He is one of the main characters of the television series adaption. He has many roles in the Mario games, including basketball, kart racing and many more. =Cranky Kong= is an elderly grumpy gorilla, known for his scathing, fourth wall-breaking commentary. Introduced in Donkey Kong Country, he has appeared in a number of Donkey Kong games, primarily as a reluctant adviser to Donkey Kong and his various simian pals (in game and in the instruction manuals), as well as running minigames and tutorials. He is currently voiced by Takashi Nagasako. The Donkey Kong Country instruction manual states that Cranky is the original Donkey Kong character featured in the 1981 arcade game.\\"He groggily rolled over to see the familiar wrinkled, white-bearded, grouchy face of his old granddad \\"Cranky Kong\\" peering down at him. In his heyday, Cranky was the original Donkey Kong who battled Mario in several of his own games.\\" - Donkey Kong Country instruction manual, pg. 6 The current Donkey Kong (introduced in Donkey Kong Country) was initially described as his grandson, with Cranky having relinquished his name to him.Mentioned by Otacon in Super Smash Bros. Brawl. However, in Donkey Kong 64, Cranky directly refers to the current Donkey Kong as his son in their first conversation. This was reverted to the original grandson relationship in subsequent games such as the Game Boy Advance versions of Donkey Kong Country and Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest, Super Smash Bros. Brawl and Donkey Kong Country Returns. As his name implies, Cranky is perpetually bitter about many things and complains about them to anyone who gives him even the slightest acknowledgment. He is mostly angry about the state of modern video games, once going so far as to complain about how many bits and bytes are used up to simply animate his swinging beard. Every time he sees any such thing he seems to fondly recall his heyday in which he was an 8-bit character with only three frames of animation. In Donkey Kong Country on the Super NES, Cranky's main purpose was to distribute helpful hints about the game's many stages to Donkey Kong and his sidekick Diddy Kong whenever they dropped by his cabin. Donkey Kong Country 2 saw him play a similar role, although this time the player would have to provide enough banana coins to buy specific hints. In Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble! he was the player's opponent in a throwing mini game at Swanky's Sideshow; in the GBA versions of Donkey Kong Country 2 and Donkey Kong Country 3, he hosted several minigames, and was briefly playable in one of them. Donkey Kong 64 saw Cranky deal out potions that granted each of the five playable Kongs special abilities and could be purchased at Cranky's Lab. He also hosted the Jetpac game, and would let one to play it after earning 15 Banana Medals. Achieving 5,000 points in Jetpac earns the Rareware Coin, which was required to beat the game. Cranky also made cameo appearances in Super Smash Bros. Melee, Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate on the Jungle Japes stage, as well as appearing in Donkey Konga and its sequels. His most recent appearances have been dispensing tips in DK: King of Swing and DK: Jungle Climber, in Donkey Kong Barrel Blast where he served as a fully playable character for the first time (aside from the Dojo minigame of Donkey Kong Country 3's GBA port), and in Donkey Kong Country Returns and its 3DS remake, where he runs various shops that sell items and helps the player by giving hints and tips when they leave his shop. In Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze, Cranky becomes a playable character for the first time in a Donkey Kong platformer. His moveset is based around his cane. Cranky was a regular on the Donkey Kong Country animated series. He was still as senile as in the games, but without his fourth wall-breaking comments. His cabin was where the Crystal Coconut, the mystical bauble that made DK the future ruler of Kongo Bongo Island (as DK Island was called on the show), was kept. Often, Cranky mixed potions, somewhat prefiguring his Donkey Kong 64 role. He was voiced by Aron Tager, and by Ry≈´sei Nakao in the Japanese dub of the TV series. =Funky Kong= is a gorilla who usually supplies services to the Kongs such as allowing them to go back to worlds they have previously completed in the game. However, in Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!, he took on a different role as a vehicle merchant, allowing Dixie Kong and Kiddy Kong to reach new areas of the game world. In Donkey Kong 64, Funky switched jobs yet again to become the ammunitions expert of the group, and his business seemed to suggest an army surplus store. He supplied various weapons and upgrades to the Kongs, and donned camouflage clothing, goggles and a large rocket on his back (which is revealed near the end of the game to contain a giant boot) in favor of his old board shorts and sunglasses. He took back on his \\"surfer\\" appearance in later games. He is also a playable character in Donkey Kong Barrel Blast, as well as in multiplayer modes of DK: King of Swing and DK: Jungle Climber. He is currently voiced by Toshihide Tsuchiya. Funky was also a regular on the Donkey Kong Country cartoon, where he was voiced by Damon D'Oliveira. One difference is that the cartoon version of Funky had tan fur as opposed to the brown fur his video game counterpart had. He was also given a Jamaican accent. However, like his game counterpart, Funky is keen on surfing (he can be seen surfing in Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest), and like in the first game, he runs his own airline service. He often talks about karma and is the best dancer on the island. Funky is obviously not fond of adventuring or fighting the Kremlings, nor is he keen on doing very much work; he often tries to take the easier way out of a situation, or just leave it up to DK and Diddy. Funky also appears as an unlockable heavyweight character in Mario Kart Wii, his first appearance in a Mario game. His next appearance in a Mario game was in Mario Super Sluggers for the Wii, where he was a playable character along with the other Donkey Kong characters. Funky uses his surfboard as a bat in the game. Funky resurfaces in Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze as the keeper of the Fly and Buy shops, thus taking over the role of shopkeeper from Cranky Kong, who instead becomes a playable character. In the Nintendo Switch enhanced port of Tropical Freeze, Funky also serves as a playable character, headlining the eponymous \\"Funky Mode\\" exclusive to that port. In Funky Mode, characters can play as Funky Kong, who has extra health and other perks such as double- jumping or standing on spikes without taking damage. Players can still switch back to traditional Donkey Kong and back to Funky again while playing in Funky Mode if they wish, but Donkey Kong and his partner will both have added health. A save file cannot be changed out of Funky Mode once it has been started. =Candy Kong= is a female gorilla and Donkey Kong's girlfriend who performs various services for the Kongs throughout the different games. Candy Kong first appeared in Donkey Kong Country providing save point stations throughout the game. Her second appearance was in Donkey Kong 64; in this game, she provided instruments for DK and company to use against the Kremlings and gives the Kong family more watermelons which increase the player's life. Candy was redesigned, now wearing headphones, a pink short-sleeve top, pink short shorts, and some sneakers. She also makes a brief appearance in DK: King of Swing, and is seen cheering on the player characters. She wore a pink bikini top and short shorts, and her torso was redesigned (this appearance has remained in subsequent games). In the GBC and GBA remakes of Donkey Kong Country Candy runs challenges and a dance studio respectively. She also makes brief cameo appearances in the GBA remakes of Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest and Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!. She is currently voiced by Satsuki Tsuzumi. In the Game Boy Advance remake of Donkey Kong Country 2 she appears as a model and assistant on Swanky Kong's quiz show, and she wore a purple dress. She also made a brief appearance in Donkey Kong Barrel Blast in the mode Candy's Challenges and allowed the players to collect up to a total of 1,000 bananas and to win the tracks in first place. She, along with Swanky Kong are the only two Kongs who have yet to become playable. She was going to be one of the playable characters and replacing Redneck Kong in Diddy Kong Pilot, but that game became cancelled after Microsoft Game Studios bought Rare from Nintendo. Candy was also a regular on the Donkey Kong Country animated series as well. She was voiced by Joy Tanner. However, in the series, she looked completely different from the pink-clad blonde seen in the games. Also, on the show, she worked at the barrel factory run by Bluster Kong, her boss. This version of Candy also showed off a very quick temper to match her fiery red hair. In 2007, Games.net ranked Candy Kong #2 on their list of \\"Top Ten Disturbingly Sexual Game Characters\\". =Dixie Kong= is a young female chimp\\"A wilful and adventurous young chimp,\\" - Rareware: DKC Trilogy Cast List Official Website or monkey\\"Dixie Kong: a heroic little monkey with a dangerous ponytail- Official Nintendo Website - Wii (US) with a prehensile ponytail. She is Diddy Kong's girlfriend. Her first appearance is Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest as Diddy Kong's sidekick and girlfriend. Dixie later made the starring role of Donkey Kong Country 3, subtitled Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!, with Kiddy Kong as her sidekick. She is currently voiced by Kahoru Sasajima. While she did not return in Donkey Kong 64, her sister, Tiny Kong, served as her replacement. Her next playable appearance was in Donkey Konga 2 on the Nintendo GameCube, a bongo rhythm game. She appeared once again in the Japan only Donkey Konga 3. She is also a playable character in Diddy Kong Racing DS, DK: Jungle Climber, and Mario Hoops 3-on-3 for the Nintendo DS, DK: King of Swing for the Game Boy Advance, Mario Superstar Baseball for the Nintendo GameCube, Mario Super Sluggers and Donkey Kong Barrel Blast for the Wii, Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze for the Wii U and Nintendo Switch, and Mario Kart Tour for mobile phones. Dixie appears in the Donkey Kong Country TV series. Provided voiceover by actress Louise Vallance. =Wrinkly Kong= is an elderly gorilla, and the wife of Cranky Kong. Wrinkly first appeared in the game Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest for the Super NES, where she ran Kong Kollege. She gave the player advice and allowed the player to save his or her game. She appeared again in Donkey Kong Land 2, and again in Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!. This time, she resided in 'Wrinkly's Save Cave', where the player could both save their game and deposit Banana Birds, which were found throughout the game. This concept remained sans birds in Donkey Kong Land III, where she resided in 'Wrinkly Refuge'. In the Game Boy Advance version of Donkey Kong Country 3, Wrinkly was portrayed as a spiritual follower of the Banana Birds. She is currently voiced by Miho Yamada. Wrinkly next appeared in Donkey Kong 64. She had apparently died at some point after Donkey Kong Country 3 as she is now a ghost. Every world lobby in the game, with the exception of Hideout Helm, featured five doors with Wrinkly's face on them; each door presented a hint for the level that applied to the Kong that corresponded to the door color (yellow for Donkey Kong, red for Diddy Kong, blue for Lanky Kong, purple for Tiny Kong, and green for Chunky Kong). When the player begins meeting her in Donkey Kong 64, she says, \\"Don't be afraid of me, young ones! It's only me, Wrinkly Kong,\\" and then she gives the player advice on how to win a Golden Banana on the corresponding level. Her first playable appearance was in DK: King of Swing and would later return for DK: Jungle Climber, and as an unlockable character in Donkey Kong Barrel Blast. She also appears as a trophy in Super Smash Bros Brawl and Super Smash Bros. for Wii U. =Swanky Kong= is a Kong entrepreneur. He first appears as the game show hosts a TV show called \\"Swanky's Bonus Bonanza\\" in Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest in which Diddy and Dixie must answer questions about the game correctly to win extra lives. The questions would range from easy ones such as enemies and worlds featured in the game to more difficult ones such as objects in the background of levels. After Crocodile Isle was destroyed in Donkey Kong Country 2, Swanky ran \\"Swanky's Sideshow\\" in the Northern Kremisphere of Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!. Swanky would give Bear Coins and Banana Bunches as a reward for winning, or a fraction of each as a consolation prize for losing. In Donkey Kong Country 2, he wears a blue oversized jacket and had an afro hair style. In Donkey Kong Country 3, he wears a white long-sleeved shirt, a gold vest, a bowler hat, black pants, black and white shoes, and had a diamond-topped cane. In the Game Boy Advance version of Donkey Kong Country 2, Swanky's role remained the same except that he now has Candy as his assistant. Upon completing all of his quizzes, Swanky will reward the player with a photo of himself to add to the scrapbook. In the GBA version of Donkey Kong Country 3, Swanky sported his Donkey Kong Country 2 look and now runs \\"Swanky's Dash\\", a virtual reality game where stars are collected as Dixie (as Kiddy is too young to play). If enough stars are collected, Swanky will give the player Bear Coins, Banana Bunches, and Extra Life Balloons. Swanky Kong has yet to appear in other games and become playable along with Candy Kong. His relationship to the Kong Family is currently unknown. =Kiddy Kong= Kiddy Kong, known as in Japan, is a large baby primate that was introduced in Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble! as Dixie's sidekick and three year old toddler cousin\\"Many of the Kongs find it alarming that Kiddy has reached such a size at the tender age of three - Rareware: DKC Trilogy Cast List Official Website as well as the younger brother of Chunky Kong. Their mission was to solve a series of mysteries in the Northern Kremisphere and find their missing friends Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong. Kiddy Kong was also playable in Donkey Kong Land III where he joins Dixie in her quest to prove herself worthy by finding the fabled Lost World before DK, Diddy, and the Kremlings. He did not appear in Donkey Kong 64, but was mentioned in the manual as being the baby brother of Chunky Kong. He was slated to appear in Donkey Kong Racing before it was cancelled and so far has yet to appear in any games since then. His abilities included water skipping, being able to roll farther to make longer than average jumps, and throwing Dixie high out of normal jump reach, with Dixie being able to throw him and guide his fall to break platforms and unveil hidden secrets. Kiddy appears in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate in Dixie Kong's upgraded spirit. He, however, does not have his own spirit. =Tiny Kong= is a young, female chimpanzee from the Donkey Kong games who first appeared in Donkey Kong 64. She has blonde hair with pigtails. She is Dixie Kong's younger sister and is a cousin to Chunky Kong and Kiddy Kong, as stated in the manual for Donkey Kong 64. She is currently voiced by Kahoru Sasajima. In Donkey Kong 64, her clothing was a beanie hat, blue overalls, a white T-Shirt, and white shoes. She was freed by Diddy Kong in the 'Angry Aztec' level in the building near Candy's Music Shop. Her weapon is the Feather Crossbow, her instrument is the 'Saxophone Slam', the Potion enables her for 'Mini-Monkey', 'Pony-Tail Twirl', and 'Monkey-Port'. She can shrink when she jumps into her special barrel, allowing her access to areas other Kongs cannot go. She can do a helicopter-spin, equivalent to Dixie's, to slow down her descent. And she can teleport virtually anywhere when standing on a blue pad. Tiny was one of the confirmed characters in Donkey Kong Racing for the Nintendo GameCube with Donkey Kong, Diddy, Kiddy, and Taj the Genie, but the game was canceled as Microsoft purchased Rare in September 2002. She makes a cameo appearance in the Game Boy Advance ports of the Super NES games Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest and Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!. In Donkey Kong Country 2, Diddy, Dixie, or both must rescue her from the Zingers in a mini-game called Kongnapped and the objective is to rescue six of her in order to win. In Donkey Kong Country 3, she appears in one of Funky's Motorboat challenges. These two games are the only games where she is not a playable character. In her spin-off debut, Diddy Kong Racing DS, she seems to have grown more mature, making her both taller and more physically developed than her older sister, Dixie. Her clothing now consists of a beanie hat, sweat pants, a midriff revealing spaghetti-strap top, sandals and fur wristbands, as well as earrings that she did not wear in the previous games. She is one of the first eight playable characters. Her acceleration and handling are slightly below average, and she has a medium top speed. In Donkey Kong Barrel Blast, Tiny is one of the Kongs in this game. It is the first game on the Wii she appears in. It is also the second racing game for her character. She is one of the unlockable characters in this game. She was unlocked by completing Sapphire Mode on a Rookie Setting as one of the Kongs. Tiny Kong also appears as a playable character in Mario Super Sluggers, this was also Tiny Kong's debut in the Mario franchise. She later makes a cameo appearance in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate as a Spirit, using her artwork from Donkey Kong 64, the first time she has done so since the GBA version of Donkey Kong Country 3. =Lanky Kong= is a goofy orangutan who is a distant cousin to the Kong family. Lanky's first appearance was in Donkey Kong 64 as one of the game's five playable Kongs. He was freed by Donkey Kong in the 'Angry Aztec' level in the Llama's Temple. His weapon is the 'Grape Shooter', his instrument is the 'Trombone Tremor', and the potion enables him to do 'OrangStand', walking on his hands to climb steep slopes. 'Baboon Balloon' allows him to inflate himself to reach higher areas, and 'OrangSprint' allows him to run really fast on his hands. In the level, 'Gloomy Galleon', he can transform into Enguarde the Swordfish when he enters the Enguarde Crate. Lanky Kong is known for his lack of style or grace, as well as his goofy-looking face. He is currently voiced by Kentaro Tone. Lanky appears in his spin-off debut, Donkey Kong Barrel Blast as one the unlockable characters. In Donkey Kong Country, enemy orangutans known as Manky Kong appeared, but it is unknown if they have any relation to Lanky. Lanky Kong makes cameo appearances as a trophy in Super Smash Bros. Brawl and Super Smash Bros. for Wii U, as well as a collectible Spirit in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. =Chunky Kong= is a large yet ironically very young simian weighing 2,000 lbs and is one of the playable Kongs in the game Donkey Kong 64. Chunky is the older brother of Kiddy Kong and cousin of Dixie Kong and Tiny Kong. He was freed by Lanky in the level Frantic Factory. Before he was freed, he indicates that he does not like heights. Despite his brawny build, he acts somewhat cowardly, childish and lacks some intelligence indicated by him speaking in third person and Broken English. He also seems slower on the ball than the other characters. During the attract mode to Donkey Kong 64, all the Kongs are displayed and their abilities are shown in the manner of a hip hop video. Chunky Kong is dressed in a flare-legged disco outfit with an afro hairstyle, but immediately realizes this is out of style (or out of place for rap) and runs off, immediately returning, wearing more appropriate clothes. One example of Chunky's fears is in the \\"character select screen spotlight\\" where he panics and asks the player to choose his more mature cousin Tiny. His weapon is the 'Pineapple Launcher', his instrument is the 'Triangle Trample', and the potion enables him to do 'Hunky Chunky', turning gigantic, 'Primate Punch', unleashing a very powerful punch which can smash down some doors and walls, and 'Gorilla-Gone', turning temporarily invisible. He can carry boulders and other heavy items that the other Kongs cannot carry. It was Chunky, with a combination of the 'Hunky Chunky' and 'Primate Punch' abilities, who defeated K.Rool in the last boxing match in Donkey Kong 64. He appears as a sticker in Super Smash Bros. Brawl. He also made a brief cameo appearance in the Game Boy Advance remake of Donkey Kong Country 3 in the third challenge of Funky's Rentals, where he was one of the Kongs that he had to be rescued from the Kremlings' kidnapping threat, along with other characters such as Candy, Tiny and Cranky Kong. In Donkey Kong Barrel Blast, his weapon called the 'Pineapple Launcher' is an item that can be obtained in an item balloon and follows the player ahead of him until it hits them. In Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, he appears as a Spirit, using his artwork from Donkey Kong 64. Humans =Mario= , originally known as , appeared as the player character in Donkey Kong. He was the antagonist in Donkey Kong Jr., and further appeared in Donkey Kong Hockey and the Mario vs. Donkey Kong series. =Pauline= , originally known as , is the damsel in distress from the original Donkey Kong, as well as the 1994 Game Boy game of the same name. She also appeared in Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2: March of the Minis, Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Minis March Again!, Super Mario Odyssey and Mario Kart Tour. Pauline was created by Shigeru Miyamoto and other developers for the 1981 arcade game Donkey Kong. She is the earliest example of a female with a speaking role in a video game, and is cited as a famous example of a damsel in distress in fiction. =Stanley= , sometimes called Stanley the Bugman, is the protagonist of Donkey Kong 3. Stanley has only made one other prominent appearance as the protagonist of the Game & Watch game Greenhouse, in which he sprays worms attacking his plants. Greenhouse was re-released in Game & Watch Gallery 3, but the Modern Version stars Yoshi instead. Stanley also appears in Donkey Kong 3 microgames in both WarioWare: Twisted! and WarioWare: Touched! and a trophy of him can be obtained in the game Super Smash Bros. Melee. He also appeared in the Saturday Supercade cartoon. Kremlings are a villainous group of crocodilian raiders and various other animals that are ruled by King K. Rool and antagonize the Kongs on a regular basis. They make their home on the Crocodile Isle, They come in many sizes, varieties and colors, and with many of the crocodilian enemies being anthropomorphic. Many of their names begin with the letter \\"K\\", with the exception of Skidda from Donkey Kong Country 3. In the first Donkey Kong Country, the Kremlings wore military attire, but with the sequel, they switched their gear to pirate-themed ones. In the third game, many of them are seen with no clothing of any sort. The Kremling Krew is the name used for K. Rool's entire army, which not only consist of the Kremlings, but also of many different animal species (birds, mammals, insects, fish, other reptiles, etc.) on their side. Several machines and ghosts seem to be included in the Kremling Krew as well. Many of these enemies also appeared in Donkey Kong 64 and are playable in Donkey Kong Barrel Blast. While almost all the Kremlings are enemies of the Kongs, one exception is K. Lumsy, who opens up levels for the Kongs in Donkey Kong 64. The Kremlings were originally conceived for a game called Jonny Blastoff and the Kremling Armada, an unreleased point & click adventure game that predated Donkey Kong Country. =King K. Rool= King K. Rool is a hot-tempered, authoritarian and baleful green Kremling who was the main antagonist of many Donkey Kong games and has been Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong's archenemy ever since his creation during the era of Rare development. The despotic king of Kremlings and master of Kremling Krew, he constantly antagonizes the Kongs, referring to them as \\"filthy apes,\\" \\"monkey brains,\\" and \\"ludicrous lemurs\\" as well as frequently robbing Donkey Kong's Banana Hoard. His most distinguishing features are the tic in his left eye, his red cape, his gold crown and wrist bands, and his yellow belly (originally the golden front armorhttps://twitter.com/WinkySteve/status/617951129406574593) with an outie navel, his tail seems to change size or disappear completely between appearances. While overweight, K. Rool has huge muscles in his arms and he has proven to have enormous brute strength that matches (perhaps surpasses) both Donkey Kong and Chunky Kong in power. Additionally, according to the Japanese localization, K. Lumsy is his younger brother.\\"Official Japanese Nintendo Website\\" While K. Rool's crown-and-cape look has been his default appearance since Donkey Kong Country, he takes on alternate disguises and personalities to battle the Kongs in other games. * He is the pirate Kaptain K. Rool who kidnaps Donkey Kong and imprisoned him in Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest. * He later takes the alias of the mad scientist Baron K. Roolenstein who tries to take over the Northern Kremisphere in Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!. While doing so, he creates a distraction of a machine called KAOS to observe the Kongs' progress throughout the game. * He becomes King \\"Krusha\\" K. Rool in Donkey Kong 64. This game also features Gloomy Galleon, which features a sunken ship bearing pictures of his previous alias, Kaptain K. Rool. It is unknown whether or not this is 'Gangplank Galleon', the ship in Donkey Kong Country 2. In the TV series, he appears as a king and often feuds with Kaptain Skurvy (who is based on the Kremling enemy Kannon). Besides the Kritters and Klap Traps, King K. Rool's henchmen are Klump and Krusha. He is portrayed as somewhat pompous with a stereotypical English dialect. He was voiced by Chris Sutherland in Donkey Kong 64, Benedict Campbell in the Donkey Kong Country TV show, J≈´r≈çta Kosugi in the Japanese adaptation of the show, and currently by Toshihide Tsuchiya in the video games. His name is a pun on the word cruel. K. Rool also appeared in Mario Super Sluggers (his first appearance in a Mario game) as an unlockable character along with DK, Diddy, and Funky, as well as one of his Kritters. He uses his magical sceptre as a bat. In Super Smash Bros. Melee and Super Smash Bros. Brawl, K. Rool appeared as a collectible trophy. A Mii Fighter costume based on K. Rool's design appears in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U as downloadable content. K. Rool made his long-awaited debut as a playable character in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. =Klump= are large, rotund members of the Kremling Krew and appear as King K. Rool's second-in- command in various Donkey Kong games.Donkey Kong Country Player's Guide, Nintendo, 1994, p. 13Donkey Kong 64 Instruction Booklet, Nintendo, 1999, p. 5 Leading the Kremling Krew army in Donkey Kong Country, a Klump is ordered by K. Rool to steal the Banana Hoard from underneath Donkey Kong's Treehouse, which was being protected by Diddy Kong. After Klump knocks out Diddy with his \\"enormous bulk,\\" he instructs the Kremlings to stuff Diddy in a barrel and take off with the bananas.Donkey Kong Country Instruction Booklet, Nintendo, 1994, p. 5Donkey Kong Country Player's Guide, Nintendo, 1994, p. 88 Klump's main outfit is a green military helmet with three yellow chevrons, a green belt with five pockets, and black boots with white shoelaces. Due to their helmets, they are invincible to Diddy's jump; however, Diddy can defeat them with his cartwheel attack, or by throwing a barrel at them. Unlike Diddy, all of DK's attacks can defeat them in a single hit. According to the manual for Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest, the Klumps appear as their pirate alter-ego Kannon.Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest Instruction Booklet, Nintendo, 1995 p. 29 In this game, they wear earrings, a large belt, pirate boots, black eye patch and a large black hat with a human skull and crossbones. They are armed with a cannon that allows them shoot barrels and \\"Kannonballs\\" (forward or downward). Without their helmets, Klumps are now vulnerable to Diddy and Dixie Kong's attacks. In Donkey Kong 64, Klumps reappear and are depicted as much larger enemies with a pink coloration. Their army belt pockets also face the sides instead of the front. They attack by throwing green unripe Orange Grenades at the Kongs, and the only way to defeat them is by using a shock-wave attack or by throwing an Orange Grenade of their own. When defeated, they give out a salute and fall over. In the game's introduction sequence, a Klump is ordered by King K. Rool to distract Donkey Kong by stealing the Golden Bananas and kidnapping the Kong Family so that K. Rool can repair his Blast-O-Matic weapon. A single Klump appears as a playable character in Donkey Kong Barrel Blast. Klump now wears a bucket on his head, and has a brown skin coloration. He shares stats with his rival Lanky Kong. Klump was slated to appear as a playable character in another racing game, Diddy Kong Pilot, which later became Banjo Pilot after Rare was acquired by Microsoft. In the Donkey Kong Country television series, Klump serves as King K. Rool's second-in-command and is referred to as General Klump. Originally depicted with a tough military-man like exterior, Klump actually has quite the soft side to his personality, as seen by him befriending Dixie Kong in the episode \\"Klump's Lumps.\\" His skin color is also different compared to the games, with him sporting varying shades of green between seasons. He was voiced by Adrian Truss, and by Keiichi Sonobe in the Japanese dub. =Krusha= are blue Kremlings known for their supreme super-strength. Due to their strength, only Donkey Kong can defeat them in the original game and in Donkey Kong Land. They appear in the sequel in pirate gear as Krunchas. Like the previous game, they cannot be defeated with regular attacks, attempting to attack them will result in Kruncha becoming enraged, they can only be defeated with an animal friend, a crate, a barrel or with Diddy and Dixie teaming-up. Krunchas also appear unchanged in Donkey Kong Country 2's pseudo-sequel Donkey Kong Land 2. Krushas do not appear in Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!, however, similar enemies known as Krumples appear in their place. Krusha appears as a secret playable multiplayer character in Donkey Kong 64. He has an Oranges Gun, and he has a sliding ability, similar to Tiny Kong. Similar enemies known as Kasplats appear in the main game. While Krusha doesn't appear in Donkey Kong Barrel Blast, a similar blue skinned character by the name Kludge does appear. In the US version of Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Krunchas and Krumples are mentioned in Kludge's trophy description. In the TV series, a singular Krusha appears as one of King K. Rool's henchmen. He alongside Klump are considered the show's villainous comic relief. He was voiced by Len Carlson in the show. =Kritter= are common enemies in the Donkey Kong franchise and are the main foot soldiers of the Kremling Krew. In the first Donkey Kong Country game, they are usually seen either walking or jumping, Kritters known as Krashes appear riding minecarts in the eponymous minecart stages, as their name suggests, they are hazards that try to crash into the player. As with most of the Kremlings in Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest, Kritters were dressed as pirates and are outfitted with peg legs. Those who walk are named Klomp and have one peg, while the jumpers are named Kaboing and have two. The Kritters in Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble! appear to be genetically altered; the walkers named Kobble have extra muscles added, while the jumpers named Re-Koil actually bounce on their spring-loaded tails. A single leather jacket wearing Kritter known as Krunch appears as a playable character in Diddy Kong Racing. In Donkey Kong 64, Kritters are redesigned and appear sporting similar leather jackets to Krunch, as well as belt buckles with skulls on them. Two specific Kritters are seen piloting K.Rool's Mechanical Island, chasing after one of the Kongs, and serving as referees during the final battle. Krashes also reappeared in Donkey Kong 64, however they were redesigned to be much more muscular, as well as wield clubs to smack the Kongs with. Skeletal and robotic variants of Kritters also appear in Donkey Kong 64. In DK: King of Swing, Kritters appear as enemies in the main game mode and as a playable character in the game's multiplayer mode. King of Swing would mark the debut of their current muscular design. Kritters appear mostly unchanged in the game's sequel, DK: Jungle Climber. A single Kritter appears as racer in Donkey Kong Barrel Blast, sharing the same balanced stats as his rival Donkey Kong. They would make their Mario franchise debut as spectators in Mario Power Tennis. In the Mario Strikers series, a Kritter serves as a goalie for each team. A Robo- Kritter serves as the goalie for a robotic team in Super Mario Strikers. In Mario Super Sluggers, Kritters appear as playable characters and members of the DK Wilds team. Kritters appeared as trophies in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Super Smash Bros. for Wii U, as well as stickers in Brawl. They also appeared as enemies in the 3DS exclusive Smash Run mode, with Green Kritters attacking by biting three times in a row, while Blue Kritters attack by spinning around furiously with their claws. They also appear in the Donkey Kong Country TV series as King K. Rool's henchmen. A recurring French accented Kritter by the name of Green Kroc appears in the TV series as one of Kaptain Skurvy's shipmates and is voiced by Len Carlson. =Klaptrap= or Klap Traps are recurring enemies in the Donkey Kong games. They closely resemble the enemy known as Snapjaw from the arcade game Donkey Kong Jr. They appear as small crocodiles with large mouths and come in a variety of colors, but most commonly blue. Similar enemies known as Klampons and Krimps appear in Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest and Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble! respectively. Klaptraps would appear as stage hazards and as a collectable trophy in Super Smash Bros Melee, they would reprise their role as stage hazards in future games in the Super Smash Bros. series, as well as becoming Assist Trophies in Super Smash Bros Ultimate. They would also appear as hazards and enemies in the certain Super Mario spin-offs, such as Mario Power Tennis, Mario Superstar Baseball and Mario Party 7. Klaptraps also appear in the TV series, as well as a large Klaptrap known as Jr. Klap Trap or simply Jr. appears as a minor character in the TV series voiced by Ron Rubin.https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/3fdfac_72b9d6c25c3940f8b3244bdea8528dd5.pdf Other antagonists =Evil Kings= The Evil Kings are a group of villainous Kongs from Donkey Kong Jungle Beat who have invaded Donkey Kong's home turf. The head of this group, Ghastly King, is a giant, shadowy Kong-like figure who serves as the ruler of the Fruit Kingdoms. It's implied that he put a spell on Dread Kong, Karate Kong, Ninja Kong, and Sumo Kong in order to defeat DK. DK must battle these antagonistic Kongs by using conventional fighting methods, like punching and kicking. After Ghastly King is defeated, DK becomes the new ruler of the Fruit Kingdoms where they accept his leadership and congratulate him. Aside from Ghastly King, all of the Evil Kings reappear in Donkey Kong Jungle Fever and Donkey Kong Banana Kingdom, the two medal games based on Donkey Kong Jungle Beat. Karate Kong and Ninja Kong appear as Spirits in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Their Spirits are represented by Ryu from the Street Fighter series and Donkey Kong, respectively. =Tiki Tak Tribe= The Tiki Tak Tribe are a group of evil Tikis who are the antagonists in Donkey Kong Country Returns and its 3DS remake. The tribe is led by Tiki Tong, a gigantic Tiki with a wooden crown, red eyes, demonic horns, a large mouth, and a carved nose. The Tiki Tak Tribe use hypnosis- inducing music on the animals of Donkey Kong Island (namely elephants, giraffes, zebras, and squirrels) and steal Donkey Kong's bananas, forcing him to retrieve the hoard with the help of Diddy Kong. The Tiki Tak Tribe's hypnotic music does not work on DK or Diddy‚Äîpresumably because they are more intelligent than ordinary wildlife. Before the final battle against Tiki Tong, it's revealed that the Tikis use bananas as an energy source; the Tiki leader generates a pair of hands by consuming bananas and spewing the juice onto his Tiki minions. Tiki Goons, the most common members of the Tiki Tak Tribe, make a cameo appearance in Mario Kart 7 on the track DK Jungle where they attack players and make them drop coins. They reappear in Mario Kart 8 and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, performing the same function. Several different Tikis appear as collectible trophies in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, as well as a group 'Tiki Tak Tribe' Spirit in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. =Snowmads= The Snowmads are a group of arctic animals that are the main antagonists of Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze. They are a group of Vikings that have invaded Donkey Kong Island with the soldiers consisting of rabbits, snowy owls, penguins, and walruses. Most of the Snowmads wear horned helmets on their heads. Their invasion caused Donkey Kong, Diddy Kong, Dixie Kong, and Cranky Kong to band together in order to reclaim Donkey Kong Island. Their name is a combination of the words snow and nomad. Lord Fredrik, the leader of the Snowmads, is a large obese anthropomorphic walrus who uses his horn to freeze the entire island, including the volcano which the Snowmads use as their base. In Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, several members of the Snowmad army appear as collectible trophies. Additionally, Lord Fredrik appears as a Spirit in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. His Spirit is represented by King K. Rool.

Microinjection is the use of a glass micropipette to inject a liquid substance at a microscopic or borderline macroscopic level. The target is often a living cell but may also include intercellular space. Microinjection is a simple mechanical process usually involving an inverted microscope with a magnification power of around 200x (though sometimes it is performed using a dissecting stereo microscope at 40‚Äì50x or a traditional compound upright microscope at similar power to an inverted model). For processes such as cellular or pronuclear injection the target cell is positioned under the microscope and two micromanipulators‚Äîone holding the pipette and one holding a microcapillary needle usually between 0.5 and 5 ¬µm in diameter (larger if injecting stem cells into an embryo)‚Äîare used to penetrate the cell membrane and/or the nuclear envelope. In this way the process can be used to introduce a vector into a single cell. Microinjection can also be used in the cloning of organisms, in the study of cell biology and viruses, and for treating male subfertility through intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI, ). History The use of microinjection as a biological procedure began in the early twentieth century, although even through the 1970s it was not commonly used. By the 1990s, its use had escalated significantly and it is now considered a common laboratory technique, along with vesicle fusion, electroporation, chemical transfection, and viral transduction, for introducing a small amount of a substance into a small target. Basic types There are two basic types of microinjection systems. The first is called a constant flow system and the second is called a pulsed flow system. In a constant flow system, which is relatively simple and inexpensive though clumsy and outdated, a constant flow of a sample is delivered from a micropipette and the amount of the sample which is injected is determined by how long the needle remains in the cell. This system typically requires a regulated pressure source, a capillary holder, and either a coarse or a fine micromanipulator. A pulsed flow system, however, allows for greater control and consistency over the amount of sample injected: the most common arrangement for intracytoplasmic sperm injection includes an Eppendorf \\"Femtojet\\" injector coupled with an Eppendorf \\"InjectMan\\", though procedures involving other targets usually take advantage of much less expensive equipment of similar capability. Because of its increased control over needle placement and movement and in addition to the increased precision over the volume of substance delivered, the pulsed flow technique usually results in less damage to the receiving cell than the constant flow technique. However, the Eppendorf line, at least, has a complex user interface and its particular system components are usually much more expensive than those necessary to create a constant flow system or than other pulsed flow injection systems. Pronuclear injection Diagram of the intracytoplasmic sperm injection of a human egg. Micromanipulator on the left holds egg in position while microinjector on the right delivers a single sperm cell. Pronuclear injection is a technique used to create transgenic organisms by injecting genetic material into the nucleus of a fertilized oocyte. This technique is commonly used to study the role of genes using mouse animal models. =Pronuclear injection in mice= The pronuclear injection of mouse sperm is one of the two most common methods for producing transgenic animals (along with the genetic engineering of embryonic stem cells). In order for pronuclear injection to be successful, the genetic material (typically linear DNA) must be injected while the genetic material from the oocyte and sperm are separate (i.e., the pronuclear phase). In order to obtain these oocytes, mice are commonly superovulated using gonadotrophins. Once plugging has occurred, oocytes are harvested from the mouse and injected with the genetic material. The oocyte is then implanted in the oviduct of a pseudopregnant animal. While efficiency varies, 10-40% of mice born from these implanted oocytes may contain the injected construct. Transgenic mice can then be bred to create transgenic lines.

Conway visits healer Khone on the planet Goglesk, and witnesses first-hand their destructive racial mass-hysteria response to physical proximity. He inadvertently links minds with Khone and learns a great deal more. Back at Hospital Station, Conway decides to treat some Hudlar accident victims with a rear-to-front limb transplant, because stranger transplants require permanent exile. Conway also proposes staving off geriatric Hudlar problems by elective amputation.

Plot  The protagonist of the story is Sommaradvan healer Cha Thrat. She bravely saved a human pilot who crashlanded on her planet, despite a complete lack of knowledge about his physiology. Contact with her species was established by the accident, so knowledge of their social customs is still virtually non-existent. However, she is invited to join the Sector General staff. Cha Thrat innocently wreaks havoc by following her instincts and social customs. First she befriends a hypochondriac Chalder. Next, she is invited to assist at a therapeutic surgery operation to amputate the limb of a Hudlar, which will prolong its life (following events depicted in the previous novel in the series, Star Healer). When given the honour of cutting the limb, she obliges ‚Äì and then deliberately cuts her own arm off as well, in accordance with the custom of her people.

Like late books in the series, it stars an alien. However the protagonist of the early Sector General stories, Dr. Conway, plays an important supporting role, as do other regular characters. Sector General has seen its share of desperate procedures and \\"kill-or-cure\\" decisions. Senior Physician Lioren made one where the outcome was very much \\"kill\\". Now unwilling to live but not allowed to die, he has to work out what to do with himself. The early sector General stories focus almost entirely on medical problems, but later ones such as The Genocidal Healer also deal with deeper issues,. White said in an interview, \\"The Genocidal Healer is very philosophical and theological. I'm, as you know, a Catholic. If our parish priest ever reads The Genocidal Healer, I'm in deep trouble, because he's very old and very right wing.\\" Plot The dejected Surgeon-Captain Lioren is disappointed that his Court-martial has rejected the death penalty for him, and instead has assigned him to O'Mara at Sector General. He is plagued with guilt, because he is responsible for the genocide of an entire race. At moments during his new tasks, he ponders the individual events that led up to the alien deaths. First contact with the Cromsag planet was quickly followed by the discovery that their entire population was wasting away from some unidentified disease. They were starving, and their birth rate was abysmal. Additionally, they were continually in hand-to-hand combat with each other, presumably competing for food. The Sector General ships hurriedly provided food to malnourished people everywhere, along with medical aid for combat injuries, and tried to determine the cause of the mysterious disease. Despite their best efforts, deaths from the plague continued to increase. Lioren grew frustrated with the slow process of sending samples back to Sector General and awaiting diagnostics and full tests to ensure the effectiveness of potential cures. In his arrogance, he administered a treatment to the entire population ... and they rose up and slaughtered each other, wiping out their own race. Interspersed with recalling these events, he shares some of his story with people at Sector General. Lioren speaks to the terminally ill Dr. Mannen, eventually reviving Mannen's interest in life. Lioren also offers encouragement to the isolated alien Khone (see Star Healer.) Next he is asked to speak to a gigantic Groalterri, whose race is so advanced they have until now refused all contact with the federated planets. The humans are desperate to make any sort of progress with this race, but the Groalterri patient won't communicate with anyone. Bit by bit, Lioren shares his own guilty history and talks the suicidal alien into lowering its emotional barriers. From its story he manages to figure out the Groalterri's hitherto unknown injury and arrange surgery that will change its life. Finally, at the end, Lioren meets with the handful of Cromsag survivors.

Plot A famous chef wangles an appointment to Sector General for the challenge of creating food for so many different species. Like the Sommaradvan healer Cha Thrat (Code Blue - Emergency), he creates chaos everywhere he goes. He first meets the swimming \\"crocodile-like\\" Chaldars, who complain that their food is unsatisfying. Realising that they are accustomed to capturing their food live, he develops motile food for them. They are delighted, but they completely destroy their hospital ward charging around chasing it. Next, he learns that the spray-on food used to nourish the Hudlar is uninteresting. His investigations show that it needs small toxins to \\"flavor\\" it, which would be found naturally on their home planet. He visits a Hudlar ship, but causes a huge cargo bay accident expelling him into space. He rescues himself by riding some sprayers back to the station, but is in everyone's bad books. Sympathetic staffers hide him on the ambulance ship Rhabwar for an upcoming assignment. In the meantime, an epidemic at the hospital turns out to be a major nutmeg overdose caused by a sous-chef foolishly using ten times the required amount in a recipe. The Rhabwar is sent to a starving planet, whose people think their dwindling meat supply is the only desirable food and are shamed by its lack. He is able to commune with their first Cook better than the diplomats are doing. He finds ways to improve their sad vegetarian diet, and helps to set more positive attitudes toward it. The Cook's son is wounded on a game-hunting expedition, and the medical ship takes him on board for healing. The populace grows very angry, mystifying the team. They finally recall the aliens' cannibal tradition and produce him alive.

A gatekeeper is a person who controls access to something, for example via a city gate or bouncer, or more abstractly, controls who is granted access to a category or status. Gatekeepers assess who is \\"in or out,\\" in the classic words of management scholar Kurt Lewin. Various figures in the religions and mythologies of the world serve as gatekeepers of paradisal or infernal realms, granting or denying access to these realms, depending on the credentials of those seeking entry. Figures acting in this capacity may also undertake the status of watchman, interrogator or judge. In the late 20th century the term came into metaphorical use, referring to individuals or bodies that decide whether a given message will be distributed by a mass medium. Gatekeeping roles Gatekeepers serve in various roles including academic admissions, financial advising, and news editing, along with many areas of the fine arts. An academic admissions officer might review students' qualifications based on criteria like test scores, race, social class, grades, family connections, and even athletic ability. Where this internal gatekeeping role is unwanted, open admissions can externalize it. Various gatekeeping organizations administer professional certifications to protect clients from fraud and unqualified advice, for example for financial advisers. A news editor selects stories for publication based on his or her organization's specific criteria, e.g., importance and relevance to their readership. For example, a presidential resignation would be on the front page of a newspaper but likely not a celebrity break-up (unless the paper was of the gossip variety). Other people gatekeeping roles are in mental health service, clergy, police, hairdressers, and bartenders because of their extensive contact with the public. Gatekeeper is also a term used in business to identify the person who is responsible for controlling passwords and access rights or permissions for software that the company uses. One critique of gatekeeping roles is the potential to create or reinforce inequality, for example if entry is made more difficult for minority applicants or artists. For example, Bernardine Evaristo was only the first black woman to win the prestigious Man Booker Prize in fiction in 2019, a joint award with author Margaret Atwood. Academic peer review Peer review is a practice widely used by specialized journals that publish articles reporting new research, new discoveries, or new analyses in a specific academic field or area of focus. Journal editors ask one or more subject matter experts deemed to be \\"peers\\" of an article's author or authors to assess an article's suitability for publication in the journal. Notwithstanding the fact that the intent of peer review is to insure suitability and editorial quality, issues of preference or exclusion of articles are raised from time to time relating to the intellectual prejudices, career rivalries, or other biases of the journal editors or peer reviewers. Credentials Credentialing is the practice of evidencing suitability for engaging in a profession or for employability through documentation of demonstrated competency or experience, completion of education or training, or other criteria as specified by a credentialing authority. The documentation provided by the authority are known as \\"credentials\\", and may be in the form of a license, certificate of competency, a diploma, a teaching credential, a board certification, or a similar document. Credentialism refers to the practice of relying on credentials to prove the suitability of a professional person or a skilled employee to be assigned the responsibilities of professional engagement or employment.Effective Operations and Controls for the Small Privately Held Business, Rob Reider Employers may use such gatekeeping methods to ensure competence for the job, or to accede to the pressures of organizations that award credentials to require specific credentials.

It is the installment where Lone Wolf receives the legendary Sommerswerd. Gameplay In this second installment, the reader is allowed to choose an additional Kai Discipline if they completed Flight from the Dark, for a total of six Kai Disciplines. The reader also begins with a much better selection of equipment than previously available. This installment also introduces the 'Sommerswerd' - a divinely crafted weapon which grants bonuses to Combat Skill that are very useful, especially when used against undead enemies, in later installments. Plot Having informed the King of Sommerlund about the fate of the Kai Order, Lone Wolf is instructed to make a journey to their ally, the neighbouring country of Durenor, to retrieve the legendary Sommerswerd, which is Sommerlund‚Äôs only hope at repelling Darklord Zagarna‚Äôs massive invasion. Lone Wolf is given the Seal of Hammerdal and sets off on a ship bound for Durenor, but when a traitor on board sabotages the ship, he is forced to make his way on foot to Durenor despite the enemies that await him around every corner. Reception Marcus L. Rowland reviewed both Flight from the Dark and Fire on the Water together for White Dwarf #60, giving it an overall rating of 7 out of 10, and stated that \\"Both books are fair, emphasizing combat rather than traps and tricks.

Gameplay With this third book, players will find that having played through the previous books in the series and thus carried characters forward from these books can help. Since each book successfully completed grants an additional discipline and mastery level, certain parts of the book are substantially harder without these bonuses. This same theme continues through each Lone Wolf book in a given series, encouraging readers to either play through the previous books multiple times, or resort to cheating in some capacity. Plot After defeating Darklord Zagarna‚Äôs invasion, Sommerlund has begun rebuilding and little scars of war remain after one year. Work on rebuilding the Kai Monastery was about to commence when disturbing news from the north came. The merchants returning from summer trading to Kalte told of Brumalmarc, leader of the Ice Barbarian, has fallen to a hunch-backed magician. The description fit Vonotar, the former wizard from the Brotherhood of the Crystal Star, who betrayed Sommerlund and helped the Darklord Zagarna in the invasion and massacre of the Kai Order. Apparently after his defeat, Vonotar made his way to the frozen wastes of Kalte and to the ice fortress of Ikaya and through deception, managed to trick the Cruel Brumalmarc to adopt him as his magician and thus cost him his life and fortress. News of his survival spread in Sommerlund like wildfire with people demanding he pay for his treachery. The king is obliged to promise that the traitor be brought back and stand trial for his crimes and thus has asked you to go capture and bring him back. Reception Some speculated that this would be the end of the book series, but Joe Dever had always planned on writing at least four as part of his book deal, and had already sketched out the first 12 at the time the series was first commissioned.

Attributed to the \\"Ma√Ætre du Prince de Pi√©mont\\". Cath√©drale Saint-√âtienne de Sens Monopods (also sciapods, skiapods, skiapodes) are mythological dwarf-like creatures with a single, large foot extending from a leg centered in the middle of their bodies. The names monopod and skiapod (œÉŒ∫ŒπŒ¨œÄŒøŒ¥ŒµœÇ) are both Greek, respectively meaning \\"one-foot\\" and \\"shadow-foot\\". In ancient Greece and Rome Monopods appear in Aristophanes' play The Birds, first performed in 414 BC.Aristophanes. The Birds, ln. 1554 They are described by Pliny the Elder in his Natural History, where he reports travelers' stories from encounters or sightings of Monopods in India. Pliny remarks that they are first mentioned by Ctesias in his book Indika (India), a record of the view of Persians of India which only remains in fragments. Pliny describes Monopods like this: Philostratus mentions Skiapodes in his Life of Apollonius of Tyana, which was cited by Eusebius in his Treatise Against Hierocles. Apollonius of Tyana believes the Skiapodes live in India and Ethiopia, and asks the Indian sage Iarkhas about their existence. St. Augustine (354‚Äì430) mentions the \\"Skiopodes\\" in The City of God, Book 16, Chapter 8 entitled \\"Whether Certain Monstrous Races of Men Are Derived From the Stock of Adam or Noah's Sons\\",Augustine, Chapter 8. ‚Äî Whether Certain Monstrous Races of Men Are Derived From the Stock of Adam or Noah's Sons and mentions that it is uncertain whether such creatures exist. In the Middle Ages Reference to the legend continued into the Middle Ages, for example with Isidore of Seville in his Etymologiae, where he writes: The Hereford Mappa Mundi, drawn c. 1300, shows a sciapod on one side of the world, as does a world map drawn by Beatus of Li√©bana (c. 730 ‚Äì c. 800).Beato del Burgo de Osma (c. 750‚Äì800). Hereford Mappa Mundi. Folios 34v-35.  Origin  According to Carl A. P. Ruck, the Monopods's cited existence in India refers to the Vedic Aja Ekapad (\\"Not-born Single-foot\\"), an epithet for Soma. Since Soma is a botanical deity the single foot would represent the stem of an entheogenic plant or fungus.\\"Mushrooms and philosophers\\", Journal of Ethnopharmacology. John of Marignolli (1338‚Äì53) provides another explanation of these creatures. Quote from his travels from India: In fiction =Chronicles of Narnia= C.S. Lewis features monopods in the book The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, a part of his children's series The Chronicles of Narnia. In the story, a tribe of foolish dwarves known as Duffers inhabit a small island near the edge of the Narnian world along with a magician named Coriakin, who has transformed them into monopods as a punishment. They have become so unhappy with their appearance that they have made themselves invisible. They are (re)discovered by explorers from the Narnian ship, the Dawn Treader, which has landed on the island to rest and resupply, and at their request Lucy Pevensie makes them visible again. Through confusion between their old name, \\"Duffers\\", and their new name of \\"Monopods\\", they become known as the \\"Dufflepuds\\". According to Brian Sibley's book The Land of Narnia, Lewis may have based their appearance on drawings from the Hereford Mappa Mundi. =Saga of Erik the Red= In the Saga of Erik the Red, Karlsefni, accompanied by Thorvald Eriksson and others, sails around Kjalarnes and then south, keeping land on their left side, hoping to find Thorhall.

Rhetorical Figures for Shakespeare and the Scriptures homoioteleuton, \\"like ending\\"), is the repetition of words at the end of sentences. Homeoteleuton is also known as near rhyme.Brigham Young University (2006). Rhetorical Figures for Shakespeare and the Scriptures History Homeoteleuton (homoioteleuton) was first identified by Aristotle in his Rhetoric, where he identifies it as two lines of verse which end with words having the same ending. He uses the example of > ·æ¶Œ∑Œ∏Œ∑œÉŒ±ŒΩ Œ±·ΩêœÑ·Ω∏ŒΩ œÄŒ±ŒØŒ¥ŒπŒøŒΩ œÑŒµœÑŒøŒ∫Œ≠ŒΩŒ±Œπ > ·ºÄŒªŒª' Œ±·ΩêœÑŒø·ø¶ Œ±·º¥œÑŒπŒøŒΩ Œ≥ŒµŒ≥ŒøŒΩŒ≠ŒΩŒ±Œπ (1410a20) > ≈çiƒìthƒìsan auton paidion tetokenai, > all' autou aition gegonenai (1410a20) > they thought that he was the father of a child, > but that he was the cause of it (1410a20)Perseus Digital Library (2006). > Aristotle, Rhetoric In Latin rhetoric and poetry homeoteleuton was a frequently used device. It was used to associate the two words which had the similar endings and bring them to the reader's attention. We are all bound up together in one great bundle of humanity, and society cannot trample on the weakest and feeblest of its members without receiving the curse in its own soul. (Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, speech, 1866) Hungry people cannot be good at learning or producing anything except perhaps violence. (Pearl Bailey, Pearl's Kitchen) He arrived at ideas the slow way, never skating over the clear, hard ice of logic, nor soaring on the slipstreams of imagination, but slogging, plodding along on the heavy ground of existence. (Ursula K. Le Guin, The Lathe of Heaven) Types Today, homeoteleuton denotes more than Aristotle's original definition. =Near rhyme= As rhyme, homeoteleuton is not very effective. It is the repetition of word endings. Because endings are usually unstressed and rhyme arises from stressed syllables, they do not rhyme well at all. In the following passage The waters rose rapidly, and I dove under quickly. both rapidly and quickly end with the adverbial ending -ly. Although they end with the same sound, they don't rhyme because the stressed syllable on each word (RA-pid-ly and QUICK-ly) has a different sound. Brinkman, Baba. (2002). \\"The Beste Rym I Kan: The Emergence of Rhyme in English\\" However, use of this device still ties words together in a sort of rhyme or echo relationship, even in prose passages: It is important to use all knowledge ethically, humanely, and lovingly. (Carol Pearson, The Hero Within) \\"Well, sir, here's to plain speaking and clear understanding.\\" (Caspar Gutman to Sam Spade, Chapter XI (The Fat Man) in Dashiell Hammett, The Maltese Falcon (1930) \\"The cheaper the crook, the gaudier the patter.\\" (Sam Spade to Wilmer, Chapter XII (Merry-Go- Round) in Dashiell Hammett, The Maltese Falcon (1930) =Scribal error= In the field of palaeography and textual criticism, homeoteleuton has also come to mean a form of copyist error present in ancient texts. A scribe would be writing out a new copy of a frequently reproduced book, such as the Bible. As the scribe was reading the original text, his eyes would skip from one word to the same word on a later line, leaving out a line or two in the transcription. When transcripts were made of the scribe's flawed copy (and not the original) errors are passed on into posterity. An example of this can be found in the Bible, more specifically in I Samuel 11. The Israelite city of Jabesh-Gilead was under siege by the Ammonites: > Then Nahash the Ammonite came up and camped against Jabesh-gilead: and all > the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will > serve thee. But Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this condition I will > make a covenant with you, that I thrust out all your right eyes, and lay it > for a reproach upon all Israel. Prior passages do not explain Nahash's desire to blind the Israelites, and scholars have been unable to explain this punishment in the context of the Bible. A find from the Dead Sea scrolls, the scroll 4QSama, gives the missing beginning to I Samuel 11. Some very recent English translations (such as the TNIV) add the reading in a footnote. > Now Nahash, king of the B'nai Ammon (Ammonites), oppressed the B'nai Gad and > the B'nai Reuven with force, and he plucked out every right eye. There was > no savior for Israel and there remained not a (single) man among the B'nai > Israel beyond the Jordan (river) whose right eye Nahash, king of the B'nai > Ammon had not plucked out from him.

Telnyashkas are also available to civilian customers and may come in a variety of knittings. Single-stranded knitting is the standard military-issue variant, but double- and quadruple-stranded knitting for increased warmth can be produced. A quadruple-stranded telnyashka is thick enough to keep the wearer warm with nothing else on, even at , as it was originally developed to be worn by military divers under a dry suit. special forces wear telnyashkas with Afghanka battle dress during the War in Afghanistan. History Soviet Pacific Fleet sailor in full dress, including a dark-blue telnyashka The Russian telnyashka originated in the distinctive striped marini√®re blouse worn by merchant sailors and fishermen of Brittany,The ultimate symbol of french cool who adopted this style to distinguish them from other sea-going nationalities. The fashion was later adopted and popularized by the French Navy and other navies of the pre- dreadnought era. Sailors of the modern French Navy still wear these garments in certain orders of dress. The Imperial Russian Navy adopted the blue and white striped telnyashka blouse during the 19th century. The tradition of Russian or Soviet ground troops wearing a naval uniform comes from Soviet Navy sailors who fought as shore units during World War II. It is exemplified by the famed Soviet sniper Vassili Zaitsev, a petty officer in the Soviet Pacific Fleet who volunteered for army duty, but refused to give up his telnyashka because of the pride it engendered. Soviet marines in the mid-1980s Vasily Margelov, who was later to modernize the Soviet Airborne Forces (VDV), had previously served with a Naval Infantry unit in World War II, and procured telnyashkas for the VDV as a mark of their elite status. In other countries The Bulgarian 68-th Special Forces Brigade uses the telnyashka as part of its uniform. Sailors of the Cuban Revolutionary Navy wear telnyashkas with blue stripes as part of their uniform. The Korean People's Army Navy also uses them with their uniforms. Troops' colors Russian marines parade in navy blue dress uniform, with a matching navy blue telnyashka. Border Guard's Day celebration in Russia. Telnyashkas with stripes of certain colors traditionally designate particular troops, for example: * Black ‚Äì Naval Infantry * Dark blue ‚Äì Navy * Light blue ‚Äì VDV paratroopers, GRU Spetsnaz (posing as VDV) * Light green ‚Äì Border Troops * Maroon ‚Äì OMON * Red ‚Äì National Guard Forces Command, National Guard of Russia (formerly Internal Troops of the MVD) * Orange ‚Äì EMERCOM In popular culture Soviet 1936 propaganda film The Sailors of Kronstadt started aestheticization of telnyashka with a scene of a Bolshevik sailor emerging from the sea in his torn undershirt after surviving an attempted execution by drowning. The telnyashka is worn by a number of popular non-military characters of cinema and children's cartoons, notably The Wolf in Nu, pogodi and Matroskin the Cat in Troe iz Prostokvashino. The telnyashka is worn by members of various factions in the 2019 video game Metro Exodus. In the 2019 video game, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, a Russian soldier, J-12, is portrayed wearing a sleeveless telnyashka under a tactical ammo vest during Farah Karim's flashback of the Russian invasion of Urzikstan.

History Pacific Mutual Life was founded in 1868 by former California Governor, Leland Stanford in Sacramento, California. Stanford also was the first policy holder of the company. After Stanford died and his university (Stanford University) was strapped for money, his wife used the money from the policy to pay for professors. Starting in 1885, Pacific Mutual Life began issuing accident insurance, which was an innovative move for a life insurance company at the time. In 1906, Pacific Mutual Life merged with Conservative Life, a Los Angeles-based life insurance company. Following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, Pacific Mutual Life's board of directors moved the company to Los Angeles. Since 2005, the company is domiciled in the state of Nebraska. During the Great Depression, the company was hit with hard times and in 1936 in an effort to save both the policy holders and the company the insurance commissioner, Samuel L. Carpenter, encouraged the policy holders to become part owners of the company through mutualization. In 1955, Pacific Mutual Life became the first company west of the Mississippi River to use the brand new technology of Univac I. At Pacific Mutual Life's one-hundredth birthday the company celebrated with keynote speaker Ronald Reagan. In 1971, the company started Pacific Investment Management Company (PIMCO). The company moved its headquarters to their current Newport Beach, California location in 1972 when management decided that Newport Beach would provide a higher standard of living for their families. In 1997, the company dropped mutual from its name, changing it to Pacific Life Insurance Company. This reflects the company structure's change from a mutual ownership to a mutual holding company structure. Also in 1997, the company adopted the humpback whale as symbol of the company because of the whale's persistence, performance, and strength. On May 30, 2007, Pacific Asset Management was created. Pacific Asset Management offers advisory services and institutional fixed income management. Pacific Asset Management focuses on credit oriented fixed income. Pacific Asset Management's investment team manages bank loans, high yield corporate bonds, investment grade bonds and money market securities. Pacific Asset Management provides their clients the ability to invest with an entrepreneurial, boutique investment group focused on fundamental credit analysis and supported by the scale and infrastructure of Pacific Life. Pacific Asset Management currently manage registered investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as well as separate accounts. The Pacific Life Foundation was established in 1984 and is headquartered in Newport Beach, CA. At year-end 2011, the Foundation's trust principal was approximately $63.5 million. In 2011, $5.5 million was contributed to over 400 agencies in the areas of health and human services; civic, community, and environment; education; and arts and culture and $5.6 million is committed through 2012. In 2017, Pacific Life launched Swell Investing, a subsidiary focused purely on impact investing. Swell was not able to achieve the scale needed to sustain investment independent operations. As a result, on August 30, 2019, Swell was closed. In 2020, Pacific Life confirmed the addition of Louise Pentland, executive vice president and chief business and legal officer of PayPal, Inc., to the board of Pacific Mutual Holding Company, Pacific Life Insurance Company's ultimate parent company. She started her term as of 1 August 2020. Aviation Capital Group Aviation Capital Group LLC owns, manages, and leases commercial jet aircraft internationally, and offers aircraft asset management services. Headquartered in Newport Beach, California, the company owned and managed 439 aircraft leased to 95 airlines in 45 countries by the end of 2017. The company was founded in 1989; Pacific Life became its majority shareholder in 2001. In August 2019, ACG said its equity value was $3.6 billion. In September 2019, it was reported that Pacific Life Insurance will sell its aviation unit for an estimated $3 billion to minority stockholder Tokyo Century Group, which owns 24.5% of Aviation Capital Group. The sale was completed on December 5, 2019.

The first large-scale production of the cheese was established at Midtsj√¶llands Herreg√•rdsmejeri in the early 1940s.

Character Esrom is a porous cheese, with many small holes throughout, and is slightly elastic and buttery in texture. Commonly used as a table or melting cheese, it is also good in casseroles or sandwiches and is similar to havarti or Saint Paulin. Because of its bold flavour, it goes well with dark beers and red wines. It is slow ripened from a starting culture for a period of 10 to 12 weeks, then cured in rectangular moulds. It has a waxy yellow-brown rind.

He was educated at Merchiston Castle School, and played club rugby for both Northampton Saints and Newcastle Falcons. At Newcastle he made 15 appearances as they won the 1997-98 Premiership. He was forced to retire due to injury in June 2000. He was assistant coach, Academy Coach and Head for Newcastle Falcons between 2000 and 2008. Since 2008 he has been Assistant Coach with England U18 during which they won three consecutive Grand Slams and had a sequence of 19 victories.RFU Coaches Profile International selection Under World Rugby rules, the clauses in Regulation 8, Guideline 17 can be taken to pertain to international eligibility in schooling cases. Regulation 8 on international eligibility is clarified under Guideline 17. The specific 'schooling' clauses state: For the avoidance of any doubt, seeking to rely on short periods of Residence as a child in a particular country, combined with a short period of Residence in that same country prior to playing for a Union, is likely to create a link that would be too tenuous to satisfy the underlying intentions of establishing a contemporary, permanent, national link with a Union. However, each case will be assessed on its overall merits to establish if a Player is able to demonstrate a genuine, close, credible and established national link by reference to the amount of time the Player can demonstrate that he has treated the ‚Äúnew‚Äù country as his home and other relevant factors. Walton spent 7 years in Merchiston Castle School in Edinburgh. He played for and captained Scottish Schoolboys in Rugby. However he was initially told that this would not be enough for play for Scotland internationally so then played for England Under 19s. Walton states he felt Scottish and that the English players called him 'Jock'. He was then selected by Scotland on the basis that his 7 years schooling in Scotland gave him a genuine and credible link to the nation. At the time he was living in England but he was available to capped as the clauses above do not mention immediacy. The Home Nations have since agreed that 5 years schooling is enough to provide a genuine and credible link to allow international selection in international football and this has been approved by FIFA. World Rugby still assess each case on their individual merits and the demonstration of a genuine, close, credible and established national link is key.

It was originally built in the 1880s and upgraded a few years later by Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad and was designed by American Bridge Company. Top of the deck, 2005 View of Downtown from the top of the deck in Autumn 2005 The bridge is entirely within Minneapolis but the railroad line crosses into St. Paul less than a half mile to the east. The name \\"Short Line\\" comes from the Milwaukee Road's construction of a shorter, more direct connection between St. Paul and Minneapolis. Previously the connection was made via a line that headed southwest along the Mississippi River, north at Mendota and northwest via Fort Snelling to downtown Minneapolis. The \\"Short Line\\" was part of a number of construction projects in the 1880s that also included a roundhouse and yard near the present-day junction of Lake Street and Hiawatha Avenue, as well as a line to the west just north of Lake Street (today's Midtown Greenway). As railroad traffic became less important in the Twin Cities in the latter part of the 20th century, the Milwaukee Road gradually abandoned several of its lines in the area. It still found use for the Short Line Bridge route, however, as did Milwaukee Road successors Soo Line Railroad and Canadian Pacific. The bridge was also used by the Twin Cities and Western Railroad. Through trains continued to cross the bridge until the former Milwaukee Road was severed at Lake Street as part of the reconstruction of Hiawatha Avenue (Minnesota State Highway 55). The bridge is still used today by the Minnesota Commercial Railway to service grain elevators along Hiawatha Avenue. There has been some discussion about using the bridge as a connection for the Midtown Greenway across the Mississippi River, but Canadian Pacific has not been receptive to the idea. In July 2006 there was a severe fire on the bridge which caused $200,000 in damage, closing down rail traffic until it could be repaired. Originally the cause was thought to have been small fireworks, but later appeared to be arson, by dousing the bridge in gasoline. The bridge in the specific spot could only hold at maximum 50 pounds of weight. To prevent people from hurting themselves, local authorities patrolled each side of the bridge from 6:00 pm ‚Äì 6:00 am in the days following the event. Now a fence blocking access to the bridge states that any trespassers will be fined and/or serve jail time. There was a smaller fire at an unknown date prior to this incident. The bridge was repaired within a few weeks in order to continue to serve a few customers of the west side of the river that had no other rail access aside from this line. Special ties were brought in from across the country to repair the damaged area.

It encompasses and as of July 18, 2019, had 55,359 interments. In January, 2014, it was one of only fourteen cemeteries to be designated as a national shrine. A new 2,000 niche columbarium was dedicated on July 24, 2014. It is one of a few National Cemeteries with their own Honor Squad. Since its formation, unless refused by family and during a few weeks the National Cemetery Administration disallowed military honors in their cemeteries, no veteran has been buried without a Rifle Salute in addition to \\"Taps\\" and the folding and presentation of the Flag. It is also the only National Cemetery with the remains of a funeral tunnel which once allowed deceased veterans to be removed from the Home Hospital to the cemetery. Plans are in process to restore the entrance into the tunnel to its original form.  History  The cemetery was established in 1867 as a place to inter veterans who died while under the care of the Central Branch of the National Asylum for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers and Seamen, located in Dayton. It was the third such home authorized by Abraham Lincoln, March 3, 1865, just before his death. The first interment, of Civil War veteran Cornelius Solly, was on September 11, 1867. The National Asylum became part of the newly formed Department of Veterans Affairs in 1930 and evolved into today's Dayton VA Medical Center. The cemetery was administered as part of the medical center until 1973, when it was transferred to the National Cemetery Administration. Dayton National Cemetery is one of eight National Cemeteries with the remains of veterans from every major conflict the United States has been involved in dating back to the American Revolutionary War. 650 Colored Troops are interred at Dayton National Cemetery, one of the largest collection of Colored Troops' graves which links the cemetery even further with Lincoln since he authorized the creation of Colored Troops units.

It has some relatively old trees compared to much of the forests in the Piedmont; as such, it has been extensively studied by scientists. Large specimens of white oak and tulip poplar, which grow up to 156 feet (47.5 meters) tall, can be found along one slope within the forest. There also are a few equally tall loblolly pine. Other canopy species include American beech, black oak, northern red oak, southern red oak, pignut hickory, bitternut hickory, mockernut hickory, winged elm and red maple. Eastern flowering dogwood, sourwood, umbrella magnolia and eastern redbud are prominent among the smaller trees. The forest floor is covered by many shrub, wildflower, and fern species. Common animals include raccoon, coyote, opossum, gray squirrel, chipmunk, American crow, pileated woodpecker, box turtle and several snake species, including the venomous copperhead. The soils are mostly well-drained, with medium brown or dark reddish brown sandy loam topsoils. The subsoils are clay loam or clay; they are medium red or dark red. The darker soils, which support higher plant diversity, have developed on mafic rock; the medium-toned soils are on felsic rock. History Bloodroot, Sanguinaria canadensis Fernbank Forest was purchased from Col. Z. D. Harrison in 1939 by a group of citizens who organized Fernbank, Inc., which today operates as Fernbank Museum of Natural History for the conservation and preservation of this old-growth forest to inspire and teach about nature. Fernbank is the 4th oldest environmental conservation not-for-profit in the United States. In 1964 the Fernbank Trustees developed a 48-year lease which was accepted by the DeKalb County Board of Education, agreeing to manage and maintain the forest in exchange for offering free access to the public. The lease was renewable in eight-year intervals for a maximum of 48 years. = Controversy 2012 - 2014= The transfer of the lease from Dekalb County School System in 2012 led the closing of the forest and subsequent controversy. At the time, self-guided tours were not allowed in the forest due to safety concerns. A Move-On petition garnered over 500 signatures to allow public access to the Forest. Concerned community members claimed the forest was not being maintained, leading to a possible reduction of educational opportunities in the forest for local school children. Community members were concerned about the lack of transparency since none of the plans were initially made public. = Forest reopens = In September 2016, after a 4-year restoration period, the forest reopened as part of the Fernbank Museum of Natural History. Visitors to the museum can join guided tours with museum educators or go on self-guided tours along the paths of the forest. The museum now offers outdoor educational programming for students in the metro Atlanta area.

This collaborative peer reviewed project began in 1995, and is written by biologists from around the world. The site has not been updated since 2011, however the pages are still accessible. The pages are linked hierarchically, in the form of the branching evolutionary tree of life, organized cladistically. Each page contains information about one particular group of organisms and is organized according to a branched tree-like form, thus showing hypothetical relationships between different groups of organisms. In 2009 the project ran into funding problems from the University of Arizona. Pages and Treehouses submitted took a considerably longer time to be approved as they were being reviewed by a small group of volunteers, and apparently, around 2011, all activities ended. History The idea of this project started in the late 1980s. David Maddison was working on a computer program MacClade during his PhD research. This is an application that give insight into species' phylogenetic trees. He wanted to extend this program with a feature that allowed the user to browse through phylogenetic trees and zoom into other lower or higher taxa. Hence, this association was not unique in a stand-alone application. The researchers came up with the idea to export the application into the world wide web and this was realized in 1995. From 1996-2011, over 300 biologists from around the globe added taxa web pages into the phylogeny browser. Quality To ensure the quality of ToL project, the board made use of peer-review.

Description Castlereagh Street's northern terminus is at the junction of Hunter Street, with its southern terminus at the junction with Hay Street, near Belmore Park.Gregory's 2002 Street Directory, 66th Edition The street is one-way southbound to motorised traffic, with a bicycle path running in both directions from Liverpool Street to Hay Street. At its northern end near Martin Place, the street is lined by many of Sydney's most expensive boutiques and jewellery stores, such as Chanel, Gucci, Cartier, Bvlgari, Dior, Prada, Van Cleef & Arpels, Ermenegildo Zegna, Omega and Mont Blanc. Etymology Previously Chapel Row and Camden Street, Castlereagh Street was named by Governor Macquarie in 1810 in honour of Viscount Castlereagh, the Secretary of State for the Colonies. At the time the street included what is now known as Loftus Street, named as Castlereagh Street North, until 1881, and what is now known as Chalmers Street, prior to the establishment of Belmore Park, until 1905. History Castlereagh Street once contained the Australia Hotel, whose foundation stone was laid by Sir Henry Parkes, and the Theatre Royal. Both of these buildings were demolished during the 1970s. The Circular Quay to Central station line was an important part of the Sydney tram network. It was an extremely busy service for passengers transferring from suburban trains, particularly prior to the opening of the City Circle underground railway line in 1926. Trams operated in a loop from Central station, running north along Pitt Street to Circular Quay returning south via Castlereagh Street. These tracks were also used by some eastern and south-western routes during busy periods. The line closed on 27 September 1957 with four tram services replaced with buses and three others diverted to operate via Elizabeth Street.New Details of Sunday's CHange-over to Buses in Sydney Sydney Morning Herald 27 September 1957 page 4Buses Replace Trams in Two Sydney Streets Truck & Bus Transportation November 1957 page 46 The line made use of the sandstone viaduct onto the colonnade above Eddy Avenue at Central station, which since 1997 has formed part of the Inner West Light Rail. Having previously operated as a one-way street in a northerly direction, in February 1987 Castlereagh Street was changed to operate in a southerly direction.Changes to City Plan Effective February 8, 1987 Daily Telegraph 27 January 1987 page 15Work starts on new park street The Sun-Herald 8 February 1987 page 23Pitt Street mall Transit Australia May 1987 page 90 In 1997, a bus lane was introduced between Hunter and Bathurst Streets.Central City Bus Priority Scheme Australian Bus Panorama issue 13/1 August 1997 page 33 Significant heritage buildings located on Castlreagh Street include, from north to south: *The Trust Building 72-72a Castlereagh Street, located on the corner of King Street, and constructed between 1914-16.

Originally, the company was based in Burago di Molgora, Italy, where all products were made from 1976 to 2005. At its most popular, Bburago's main competition were Politoys and Maisto, the latter of which was to become dominant in the 1:18 market segment around 2000. Bburago has been a brand under the umbrella of Maisto since 2007. Nomenclature Called Martoys from 1974 to 1976, the company was founded by Mario, Ugo, and Martino Besana, who had previously started Mebetoys, which they sold to Mattel (Force 1992, 124). While Mebetoys had been 1:43 scale, Martoys, however, focused on larger toys in 1:24 and 1:18 scales. Martoys was renamed BBurago in 1976. BBurago (with two capital \\"B's\\") is the correct spelling, ostensibly standing for both the town name as well as the name of the Besana family. It is an easy detail to miss, even a book presented by the revered auction house Christie's misspells the name (Richardson & Richardson 1999, p. 173). Early models One of the earliest BBurago lines were a series of 1:43 scale Fiat trucks, but these seem to have disappeared by about 1980, according to Force (1992, pp. 22, 124 to 125). Continuing the Martoys lineup, however, most models were produced initially in 1/24 scale and mostly represented contemporary European sports and saloon cars. Most were well detailed, and included many opening features. Later, a range of 1/18 vehicles were produced which was to become the \\"bread and butter\\" of BBurago offerings. In the mid 1980s, a new 1/43 scale line was begun. As they were held together by screws, models in 1/24 and 1/18 were also commonly issued in kit form (later, 1/43 kits appeared as well). Rolls Royce Camargue in 1/22 scale. Though made in the mid-1980s, Bburago's Camargue today is a rather rare find. While vehicles in the kit ranges used the same castings as their contemporaries in the fully assembled ranges, the kits often depicted different versions, usually in racing or rally style. BBurago kits were notorious for featuring waterslide transfers which never adhered properly to the models, making well built examples of the kits rare. Clearcoat could be sprayed over the unassembled model to \\"seal\\" the decals \\"in\\". Conversely, the transfers on factory built cars were of the 'stick on' variety, rather than the 'tampo' printing used by the likes of Maisto. Larger scales Originally, the 1/18 scale range was aimed more at collectors, and BBurago was the link between European niche marketing in 1/43 scale and the 1/18 scale surge that occurred during the 1990s. BBurago was the first manufacturer to make this scale the main offering of the company, after Schuco, Gama, and Polistil pioneered larger offerings, but who by the end of the 1970s were going out of business. BBurago was also a contemporary of the mail order offerings of Franklin Mint Precision Models which were pricier, but sometimes of spotty quality. Lamborghini Diablo in 1/18 scale. BBurago did not, however, stick strictly to 1/18, with smaller cars like the Renault Alpine A110 and the Fiat 500 presented in 1/16 and larger vehicles like the Ford F-150 pickup in 1/21. 1/24 was also a regular size. The Ford pickup, however, is an exception as European marques were a main focus of the Italian company. At first, offerings consisted mostly of 1930s cars, but later, more 1950s and 1960s models were introduced, like the Jaguar XK-E roadster. Finally, many contemporary high performance automobiles, like the Lamborghini Diablo, appeared and some of these were the company's most popular sellers. For cost savings, models were often duplicated from one scale to another. The \\"Diamond\\", \\"Super\\", and \\"Gold\\" ranges were the main lines in 1/18 scale with over 30 different models. Each vehicle would be offered in two or three colors and often in a roadster and coupe version (BBurago 1996). Differences in the ranges are hard to discern, but the Super line was more aligned to classic cars, while the \\"Gold\\" series had more deluxe packaging. There were also several lines in 1/24 scale. These included the Grand Prix, Bijoux, VIP, and Super lines. The Super series included many normal coupes, sedans, and micro cars in rally and police liveries, with 45 different models (BBurago 1996). The Grand Prix line consisted of ten Formula One and Indy Cars. Bburago 1:18 scale Ferrari 550 Maranello. The larger models usually had all apertures opening, had detailed engines, spare tires in trunks, working steering, windshield wipers and detailed instrument panels. A number of models also feature active suspension and removable wheels. Early on was there was a use of plastics for door and bonnet openings. These parts sometimes hindered fit and finish, and, after extended play, would stretch or bend, causing hoods and doors to not close properly. BBurago's 1/43 scale \\"Pocket\\" series consisted of about thirty six offerings in about sixty separate liveries. These had simple 'Hot Wheels' inspired chrome on hard plastic tires, and no opening features, but were good value for the money (Rixon 2005, p. 76). Though oriented more to children in price (often selling for only a couple of dollars), 1/43 model detail was excellent and the presentation, like the early Saab 900 or the long lived MCA/Mega Monte Carlo model (one version with Russian MIG sponsorship), were quite attractive (BBurago 2000).  Smaller scales  Bburago offers several models in 1/64 scale. Most models do not have opening features. Competition increases and closure By the end of the 1990s, BBurago no longer had a main corner on the 1/18 collector market, as many competitors of both high end and low were now producing models. Some of these were Exoto, Maisto, Yatming, Ertl, Mira, Revell, Jouef, Chrono, Anson, and also Mattel, to name a few. Maisto became the main diecast brand in larger scales and began to eclipse most other manufacturers. Many of these companies had an edge as their products could be produced with far cheaper labour in Thailand and China, while BBurago continued more expensive production in Italy. In October 2005, BBurago declared bankruptcy, and the receivers were called in. Many companies expressed interest in the tooling. Fortunately, the venerable toy name of BBurago was not left to die, but was finally purchased by Mae Cheong (Maisto) from the bankruptcy court in the beginning of 2006. This essentially marked the end of Italian mass produced (and also one of the last European manufactured) affordable diecast vehicles. Prior to its closure, the company was also hard hit by an exclusive promotional contract granted to Mattel for the production of model Ferraris. As much money had been invested in the tooling to produce these models, the company was adversely affected. This contract has now changed, and other diecast manufacturers (including BBurago) are again making miniatures of the prancing horse, but at the time this stretched BBurago's finances.

Of the early cars, the rarest models are generally considered to be the Lancia Beta sedan introduced under the Martoys name, and the Innocenti Mini 120. The Lamborghini Cheetah 4x4, Renault 4L, Fiat 124 Spyder Abarth, Alfetta GTV and BMW 3.0 CSL \\"Batmobile\\" are all also now rare and valuable. Other collectible BBuragos include some rare promo models, like examples of the Camargue finished in metallic gold green, and at least one model that was issued only in mainland Europe; the Lancia Ypsilon in 1/24. The final 1/18 car issued before bankruptcy was the Peugeot 907 concept car. At the time the company ceased production of all its Ferrari models, a model of the Ferrari 360 Spider in 1/18 scale was about to be introduced. It is thought that a few may have left the factory in Italy (although this is not confirmed). A Maisto era Bburago tow truck. These newer Bburagos are made in China, not Italy. In the beginning of 2007, the name was relaunched by May Cheong, which markets Maisto, so the situation is analogous to Mattel owning both Hot Wheels and Matchbox. In order for both lines to be successful, they must be differentiated in some manner and May Cheong's logical answer was to make BBurago's offerings more European. A count from the two brands' websites in 2011 confirms the two approaches. Out of 64 1/18 scale cars, BBurago only has six models that are not European, or 9%. Maisto, with 113 total 1/18 scale models, on the other hand, has fifty three non European models or 47% non European. May Cheong bets it can avoid internal competition among brands by having Maisto carry a more global selection of marques. Many of the earlier BBurago models made at the time of the May Cheong takeover are now being produced again in Thailand and China, along with new castings. By 2011, some models, like the smaller scale \\"Race and Play\\" series of \\"garage\\" scene Ferraris, were again appearing in retail stores, such as Toys \\"R\\" Us. It appears that no models are made in Italy any longer. References * BBurago '96. 1996. Annual catalog. Printed in Italy. 80 pages. * BBurago 2000. Annual catalog.

Set in Rome during AD 72, the novel stars Marcus Didius Falco, an informer and imperial agent. The title refers to the law which stated that no Roman citizen who had been sentenced to death might be arrested, even after the verdict, until he has been given time to depart, the idea being that for a Roman citizen to choose exile outside the boundaries of the Empire would have been a fate worse than death itself. Plot summary Falco's closest friend, Petronius Longus, has finally caught one of the leading criminals in Rome, Balbinus Pius. But a quirk in Roman law allows a convicted felon, even a murderer, time to depart before the sentence is carried out. Balbinus' departure has left a vacuum in the underworld of Rome, and there is a crowd of criminals trying desperately to fill the void. Their first step is to engineer a robbery that reverberates throughout the city. Falco is again called upon by the Emperor Vespasian to supply answers, as quietly and quickly as possible. A couple of murders, a kidnapping or two, and more suspects than Falco cares to count takes him, and his patrician girlfriend Helena Justina, to places a family shouldn't have to go.

The game is licensed by the Major League Baseball Players Association and is the sequel to HardBall II. The console versions are simplified versions of the HardBall series found on the personal computers of the time. Season stats are logged through a lengthy password in these versions due to the lack of a hard disk drive that was already common in the more expensive personal computers at that time.  Release  In November 1993, Accolade signed an agreement with Atari Corporation to be a third-party developer for the recently released Atari Jaguar and licensed five titles from their catalog to Atari Corp. in order to be ported and released for the system, with HardBall III (then titled Al Michaels Announces HardBall III) being among the five licensed games and it was first announced in early 1994. It was originally planned for a Q3 1995 release date and was being developed by NuFX, however, the port went unreleased for unknown reasons. Reception Computer Gaming World in 1992 said that \\"HardBall III looks like another winner\\", complementing its emphasis on action while also providing simulation functions. The magazine praised its \\"glorious\\" support for VGA graphics and sound cards, and concluded that the game \\"packs more features in a single box than any of its competitors\\". Reviewing the Super NES version, GamePro praised the huge number of options and player stats, but felt the rough graphics and \\"choppy\\" player movements reduce the game to merely above average.

Biography Sellars was born and raised in Independence, Missouri and received his bachelor's degree from University of Central Missouri. He continued his education at the University of Missouri‚ÄìKansas City, where he received a master's degree in public administration in 1986 and a Ph.D. in 1992. His post-graduate studies include the Institute for Educational Management at Harvard University and the Strategic Planning and Higher Education Marketing program at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. In June 2006, Sellars was one 80 presidents of American colleges and universities to participate in the Council of Europe forum ‚ÄúHigher Education and Democratic Culture: Citizenship, Human Rights and Civic Responsibility.‚Äù The forum brought together 300 American and European leaders in government policy and higher education to discuss how higher education can support emerging democracies. In 2005, Sellars became the 15th president of Drury University, though his tenure ended abruptly after he announced the school was millions of dollars in debt, initiated a re-examination of the university's mission, and appeared to squelch academic freedom following a controversial interview by a faculty member.http://www.springfieldgo.com/GO-Magazine/May-9-2007/The-Fall- of-a-President/ (accessed July 2, 2009) On April 23, 2007, facing a likely vote of no confidence from the faculty, Sellars resigned.

It focuses on improving undergraduate education and advancing liberal education. Founded in 1915, AAC&U; comprises more than 1,350 member institutions ‚Äî including accredited public and private colleges, community colleges, research universities, and comprehensive universities. The organization's mission statement states its goal is \\"to make liberal education and inclusive excellence the foundation for institutional purpose and educational practice in higher education.\\" Beginning its second century as a higher education association, AAC&U; advocates for liberal education for all college students, across all fields and disciplines, at all types of institutions. This advocacy sets AAC&U; apart from other non-profit higher-education associations and positions AAC&U; in the midst of vigorous arguments about the purpose and quality of college education. AAC&U; serves all sectors of higher education; the association does not lobby for higher education. In August 2015, Inside Higher Education's Paul Fain characterized AAC&U; this way: \\"Amid talk of higher education's possible disruption and unbundling, the Association of American Colleges & Universities stakes out an aggressive middle ground. Are people listening?\\" Writing for The Chronicle of Higher Education, Dan Berrett offered a historical perspective on the purposes of college education. In an article titled \\"If Skills Are the New Canon, Are Colleges Teaching Them?\\" Berrett explored how college teaching, learning, and assessment are changing. The article situated the work of AAC&U; at the center of debate about the purpose of college education, specifically raising questions about quality of student learning and ways that educators are providing evidence that students are learning. Publications AAC&U; publishes academic journals, including Liberal Education, Peer Review, and Diversity and Democracy. AAC&U; sponsors meetings and institutes for campus teams and publishes reports and monographs. The Multi-State Collaborative to Advance Quality Student Learning The Multi-State Collaborative to Advance Quality Student Learning is a collaboration led by the AAC&U; and the State Higher Education Executive Officers. As of October 2016, the project involved 900 faculty members at 80 public two- and four-year institutions in 13 states. The project aims to produce a cross-institutional method of evaluating student learning by getting faculty from different institutions to agree on a set of general education outcomes by using a common rubric, the AAC&U; Value Rubrics, for evaluating student work. The leaders of this collaboration hope that results of the project will ‚Äúpaint an accurate picture of learning nationwide and, in turn, spark continuing improvement. The notability of the project is its ‚Äúsubject of analysis: the authentic stuff of college ‚Äì the homework, problem sets, and papers that students regularly produce.‚Äù Studies In a 2010 study, the organization found that only 30% of college students felt safe in holding unpopular opinions on their campus.

It carries I-94/US 12/US 52\\\\. It was built in 1964 and was designed by Parsons Brinckerhoff, Quade and Douglas. It is named for its proximity to Dartmouth Avenue SE, just north of the bridge. Dartmouth Bridge, 2012 The original span was an uninspired girder bridge design when compared to other Mississippi River bridges in the vicinity. However, the bridge carries more vehicles than any other bridge in the state (167,000 vehicles daily), on Interstate 94 between downtown Minneapolis and Saint Paul. The long, 148-ton box girders were fabricated in Gary, Indiana and transported up the Mississippi River by barge in October 1963. The original span was completely demolished and rebuilt in the mid-1990s. The current span uses a steel I-beam construction supported by two bridge piers. Prior to August 2007, the bridge carried four lanes of traffic in each direction. One of these lanes on each side is used for an entrance/exit lane for Huron Boulevard (East Bank) and Riverside Avenue (West Bank). Following the I-35W Mississippi River bridge collapse, through traffic was detoured along a three mile (5 km) stretch of I-94 including this bridge before turning north on Minnesota State Highway 280. To support the extra traffic volume, the deck surface was repainted to temporarily carry five lanes in each direction including the auxiliary lanes. Due to favorable response, the additional lane was made permanent and currently remains in use.

Permanent exhibits include: Innovation Station, Dino Zone!, Earth Science Discovery Cave, Life Sciences, Lockheed Martin Flight & Space, Science Playhouse, Technotown, National Grid Energy: Powering Our Future, Space Gallery, Climbing Wall and Ham Radio Station. History In 1977 the Junior League, National Council of Jewish Women and the Technology clubhttp://www.tacny.org started to plan the opening of this institution. In 1979, the goals were set to develop a center where scientific and technological information would be presented to involve the general public, students and the technical community around Syracuse, to use participatory exhibits and educational programs extensively, and to encourage creativity and involvement. The original museum, then known as the Discovery Center, opened on November 15, 1981 in a storefront at 321 South Clinton Street in downtown Syracuse. By the late 1980s, museum officials began to consider a new location for the Museum, which had become an important community asset visited by more than 800,000 people. At the same time, local officials were considering what to do with the old Armory in downtown Syracuse. In 1992, New York State and the federal government accepted The Discovery Center's proposal to open a Museum of Science & Technology in the Armory building. On October 27, 1992, the MOST, hosting hands-on exhibits and the Silverman Planetarium, opened to the public.

Plot In the beginning, a teenage boy named Lester, who is \\"kind of geeky\\" and \\"kind of sleepy\\" recently got a new issue of the Super Duper Hero Squad comic book. He was reading it while walking on a dock, until he fell asleep next to a cargo crate lying beside a cargo ship. After he and the cargo were loaded onto the ship by a crane and cruised off, the ship got hijacked by pirates who scuttled it. Lester luckily found a life jacket and swam toward the most adjacent island while the cargo ship sank. Lester must find his way home by exploring the island for someone or something that can help him survive. Development Bill Stanton was the lead artist on the project and handled backgrounds, tiles, sprites and adapting rotoscope animations. Michel Bohbot created the cover art. Eric Browning, a lead artist for Visual Concepts (as well as the voice of Lester), acted as the rotoscope model for the lead character.

His brother, Frank Yablans, was also a producer. Life and career Yablans was born to a Jewish familyAnna Gorman and Elaine Dutka, \\"For Arabs, a Man of Renown in Hollywood -'Halloween' producer, slain in Jordan terror attack, depicted Islam positively in other work\\", Los Angeles Times, November 12, 2005. in Brooklyn, New York. In 1976, he formed Compass International Pictures with Joseph Wolf, and served as its President. =Movie career= He produced films that included Halloween (1978), Tourist Trap (1979), Roller Boogie (1979), Nocturna: Granddaughter of Dracula (1979), Halloween II (1981), Hell Night (1981), Blood Beach (1981), Halloween III: Season of the Witch (1982), and Tank (1984). Since his resignation from Compass International, Yablans produced films with Charles Band such as Prison (1988). When Yablans was younger he realized he wanted to work in the movie industry by looking in one of the drive in movie theater trash and found pieces of cut out scenes. Halloween began as an idea suggested by Yablans (entitled The Babysitter Murders), who envisioned a film about babysitters being menaced by a stalker. Carpenter took the idea and another suggestion from Yablans that it take place during Halloween and developed them into a story. Along with noted film producer and financier Moustapha Akkad, Yablans put forward $300,000 for the film's production, filming in Pasadena, California over the course of 20 days. Released in late October 1978, the film was an unprecedented success, making $70 million in its initial theatrical run, becoming the highest grossing independent film of all time until it was surpassed by Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, released 12 years later. Yablans and Akkad remained as executive producers after the film's sequel rights were sold to Dino De Laurentiis, the latter producing every entry in the series until his death in 2005. Yablans and Akkad, along with producer Joseph Wolf, founded the independent production and distribution studio Compass International Pictures (later Trancas International Films Ltd).

George Lass Georgia L. \\"George\\" Lass (Ellen Muth) (1985-2003) is the youngest Reaper (both physically and chronologically) in the Club. She is the protagonist of the series, and also performs the function of narrator. As a child, she is portrayed by Talia Ranger. George was born in 1985 and raised at Beatrice Lane (in the Seattle metropolitan area) by her parents, Joy and Clancy Lass. When George was a young child, she had a very close relationship with her father. Every Sunday morning she and Clancy would eat breakfast at a local diner. However, as she grew older, George distanced herself from both her parents, becoming increasingly insolent and obstinate. The birth of her little sister, Reggie, caused George to feel neglected, creating a rift between her and Joy. George's habit of ignoring Reggie lasted until her death. At least twice in her childhood George was shown to be able to see Gravelings. In the first instance she was pushed into a public swimming pool by another girl who wanted to impress a mean clique. Two Gravelings had removed a grate at the bottom of the pool, toward which George was sinking, but one of the Gravelings appeared to argue with the other about something, and they retreated, allowing George to be rescued by lifeguards. The second instance was on a Halloween, when George confronted a serial killer about why he did not hand out candy in the traditional way (instead leaving a dish full on his steps). When looking into his house, George saw a Graveling behind the man. According to her mother, George's maturity level and intellect quickly outpaced that of her friends, leaving her alone throughout high school. George repeatedly mentions that she had no boyfriends and partook in no sexual activities in her lifetime, blatantly ignoring men who flirted with her. George began college but only lasted to midterm, after which she dropped out and sought a job from Happy Time Temporary Services. Delores Herbig purposefully found George the least pleasant job she could find after George insulted her authority and seniority. On June 27, 2003 (at the age of 18) during the lunch break of her first day of work, George was struck by a zero-G toilet seat dislodged from the de-orbiting Soviet space station Mir, and killed. Before her death, George characterizes herself as uninterested in everything, in order to ward off disappointment; by her understanding, interest led to expectations, which then led to disappointment once those expectations were cut short. After George is killed, she is met by Rube Sofer and Betty Rohmer (her own Reaper having disappeared). Unlike many of her future \\"reaps\\", George suffers from mild hysteria upon realizing she is dead. Since she is here to stay, Rube breaks many guidelines associated with reaping, taking her to her autopsy and allowing her to attend her own funeral. Once her corpse (or what is left of it) is properly interred, she becomes officially undead (\\"Un-George\\") and gains a new physical body and different appearance to all non-Reapers (portrayed by Laura Boddington in the TV series, and Jennifer Rae Westley in the later film). More than anything else, seeing her new appearance \\"freaks\\" her out the most. George assumes the name Mildred \\"Millie\\" Hagen and seeks employment from Happy Time once again. Since her appearance has changed to facilitate her reaping, she has a fresh start and this time impresses Delores, who hires her to work at Happy Time itself. In a deleted scene on the DVD, it is shown how an entire industry staffed by reapers has arisen to create new identities for newly assigned undead. She is provided with all necessary documentation to prove she is Mildred Hagen. Millie soon becomes one of Delores's friends and (arguably) most favorite employees. In order to make her reaping appointments, she frequently uses the excuses of Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, drug rehabilitation, and gynecology appointments, all of which unintentionally further Delores's sympathy for her. George begins to form a friendship with the aloof Betty, but the relationship is cut short by Betty's departure. She keeps track of her old family's life, sometimes driving by, placing silent calls, or leaving things on their doorstep. Nonetheless, Rube very solidly takes on the role of \\"the paternal one\\" (as George puts it). In addition, Delores takes on many of the responsibilities of a mother, Mason grows increasingly closer as a sort of brother, and Daisy becomes George's closest thing to a best friend. In the tradition of the Reapers, George's new home ‚Äì a small one-bedroom apartment ‚Äì is that of one of her reaps. When Daisy arrives however it is too small, and Mason soon swaps his much larger house for theirs. In addition, George gains a pet frog (Mr. Blinky) and a red Mustang convertible from her reaps. After falling for Trip Hesburgh, reaping his father and crashing the funeral, George has sex with Trip, thereby losing her virginity. She feels conflicted by the experience, and soon afterwards discovers that Trip has abandoned her. When the Ray Summers Graveling begins threatening Daisy and Mason, George catches him and reaps his soul, which results in his disintegration. George enjoys coffee, chocolate milkshakes, waffles, and oatmeal with raisins. Unlike the other Reapers (who have been dead for decades), she still has qualms with her fate as one of the undead. Five years after her \\"death\\", George is still reaping souls while working at Happy Time under her \\"living\\" name Millie Hagen. Her de facto mentor, Rube, has moved to the Great Beyond after \\"getting his lights\\" (a term among reapers where the deceased see an image of a setting that appeals to them before they move on to the afterlife). Shortly after, she encounters her sister Reggie and reveals her identity to her, but later remembers Rube's advice and realizes that this connection to the past is not going well. After talking Reggie out of killing herself, George admits that Rube was right all along. She says goodbye to Reggie, presumably for the last time, as Joy and Reggie have both showed interest in relocating. After Rube's replacement is disposed of by incineration, due to his underhanded and potentially dangerous methods, it is implied that George, to her surprise and dismay, is awarded the task of head reaper. Rube Sofer Reuben John Sofer (Mandy Patinkin) is the leader of the Club. He is laid-back and unemotional, but easily takes offense at interruptions into his daily routine (such as problems with Mason or poorly cooked meals). From the very first time he met George, Rube referred to her as \\"peanut\\", the nickname he called his daughter Rosie Sofer. As seen on an envelope, Rube's last name was originally \\"Stofer\\" but this was later changed to \\"Sofer\\". =Ante mortem= Rube was born, of Jewish descent, in or about 1875 and lived in Englewood, New Jersey. By his wife Lucy Sonia Sofer (n√©e Debrowski), who was twenty-five years his junior, he had one child, Rose Anne. Though details of Rube's past are scant, a records clerk who is assisting him in finding his daughter comes across a \\"Wanted\\" poster of Rube stating that he is a bank robber; it is probable that this led to his death. Frequent references suggest that leaving his family is an act Rube has regretted ever since. In one flashback, Rube is shown readying a pistol and accidentally awakening his daughter. After quickly hiding the pistol in a newspaper, he approaches Rose's bedside and tells her that he is going to get something that her mother needed. Upon asking her father when he would return, Rube replied, \\"Soon,\\" and sang her a lullaby to help her go back to sleep. In the 21st century, Rube goes to the dead letter department at the post office to pick up an eighty-year-old returned letter. This letter was addressed to Rose Sofer and contained a large stack of aged hundred-dollar and fifty-dollar bills. The source of the money is not shown, but it may be related to the robbery. Rube states that he mailed the package after he died. =Post mortem= Rube is the \\"foreman\\" of the group of grim reapers at the center of the series. He gets the list of who is to die, when and where, from an unnamed shadowy individual and then transfers the first initial and last name of the person, where they are to die, and their estimated time of death (ETD) to a Post-it note and assigns them to the Reapers. He enjoys eating and cooking. Although he comes off as gruff and aloof, he actually cares for his team like a father, and is particularly fond of George Lass, the newest \\"recruit\\" to his small team of Reapers. He claims to have reaped Amelia Earhart. Rube gets irritated at fellow Reaper Mason's antics and frequently calls him a \\"fuck-up.\\" However, he suspects that Mason is smarter than he seems. A skilled shell game operator, Rube once taught Mason techniques from the game, which he used to sell a line of kitchen appliances. The disappearance of Betty Rohmer, a Reaper with whom he worked since her own death in 1926, disturbed him greatly. He hates computer keyboards, claiming they are too fragile as compared to typewriters, and avoids using them, and by extension computers, whenever possible. One of the more mysterious of the Reapers featured on Dead Like Me, his full name was not revealed until the episode \\"Death Defying\\". His date of death was never made explicit, but implied to be the earliest of the known reapers, save recurring ex-colleague Penny. Mason jokes in \\"Rites of Passage\\", \\"Rube's so fucking old, he reaped Jesus.\\" In \\"Ghost Story\\" George thinks Rube probably reaped Houdini, even though in that episode Rube indicates he believes the stage name is one word, \\"Houdini\\" rather than \\"Harry Houdini\\". In a major character arc during the second season, he was greatly upset when he discovered that a package of money that he had sent after his death to his daughter and wife in 1927 was never delivered, and embarked upon a quest to find out why. While he searched public record archives, during which he found the death certificate for his wife, he discovered a wanted poster that indicated he was a bank robber. His daughter's birth certificate describes his wife as being of Czechoslovakian origin and 24 years old at the time of his daughter's birth, maiden name being Lucy Sonia Debrowski. Rube's full name is revealed here, as well as his stated occupation of salesman and that he was 49 years old at her birth. His daughter's full name is Rose Anne Sofer. Their address was 243 Georgian Lane. Lucy's death certificate was discovered but not shown, but her gravestone shows that her year of birth was 1901 and her date of death was 1941, consistent with the age given on her daughter's birth certificate. His daughter Rosie was born on 19 March 1925, according to her birth certificate in \\"Death Defying\\" (but in 1922 according to her gravestone in \\"Haunted\\") and lived at a nursing home until her death in 2004. Fellow reaper Penny (Yeardley Smith) (who died on the Titanic, referred to as a \\"boating accident\\") led Rube to Rosie, so Rube could be with her when she died. When Rube sat with her in the garden of the nursing home, Rosie recognized Rube as her father. Five years after George becomes a member of his group of reapers, Rube unexpectedly disappears the same day Der Waffle Haus is burned down. The other members found this strange, but eventually assumed that he had \\"got his lights\\" and moved on to the afterlife. Mason Mason (Callum Blue) (1939‚Äì1966) claims he was born at a rock and roll concert behind a stack of amplifiers and died drilling a hole in his own head seeking a permanent high. Mason is originally from London (he reaped Rolling Stones guitarist Brian Jones in 1969) and was transferred to his present location some time ago. He is the only Reaper besides George whose doppelg√§nger has been depicted, by Canadian actor Jacob Chaos. Mason collects money from the dead, steals from the living, deals, smuggles and uses drugs. He was an alcoholic and drug addict before he died, and though on at least one occasion he attempted to become sober, has continued these habits in response to the pressures of his job. He is attracted to Daisy, and is often protective of her. He became jealous when she became attracted to another man called Ray (Eric McCormack), whom Mason felt was dangerous; Mason eventually killed him in self-defense while trying to protect her. While he is drawn to attractive females, his feelings for Daisy seem to run much deeper. Mason said \\"I love you\\" to George on episode 13 and even kissed her, but that was probably because he was drunk. He has an edgy relationship with Rube; they dislike, but tolerate each other. Rube has on more than one occasion referred to Mason as an \\"idiot\\" or a \\"fuck-up\\", but Mason seems to at least want to gain Rube's approval. Mason is the only one among the group of reapers who was visibly pleased that Rube has moved along and is no longer part of the team. Roxy Harvey Roxanne \\"Roxy\\" Harvey (Jasmine Guy) invented leg warmers in 1982, and was then strangled with them by a jealous friend. She apparently has a very difficult time coming to terms with her own death, so with Rube's encouragement she marks the 21st anniversary of the event by burning her former possessions. Roxy and George are the only Reapers of the group with day jobs. She used to be a meter maid for the city, but entered the police academy at the beginning of the second season. She is a cynical, no-nonsense woman with respect to both reaping and her day job and carried a handgun to intimidate people that she tickets to keep their arguments over parking tickets short. She is the only Reaper on the series shown to use her powers in anger, when she temporarily removed the soul of a particularly rude motorist. The man subsequently started a religion around her, much to Rube's dismay (The man reverted to his usual enraged self when Roxy gripped his testicles). She sometimes cannot sleep because of nightmares. Rube considers Roxy to be his \\"second in command\\" and left her in charge when he went away to locate his daughter's whereabouts. Assigned to investigate the disappearance of Ray Summers, Roxy concluded that Daisy and Mason had something to do with it, but she chose to cover for them, claiming that Ray, who had a police record, ran off to Portland, Oregon. She is the most recent Reaper after George but is more mature than Daisy and Mason, who died at an earlier age than Roxy. Over time, George and Roxy develop a near-friendship as George acquires a greater sense of responsibility, impressing Roxy given her own police duties. Daisy Adair Daisy Adair (Laura Harris) died by asphyxiation and smoke inhalation in Marietta, Georgia on December 13, 1938, in a fire on the set of Gone with the Wind (confirmed in the series finale, \\"Haunted\\"). She is an actress who frequently tells stories of her alleged sexual escapades with actors and celebrities including Charlie Chaplin, Bing Crosby, Douglas Fairbanks, Errol Flynn, Clark Gable, Cary Grant, William Holden, Tyrone Power, and Babe Ruth (also confirmed in the series finale). She claims to be one of the Greenwich \\"Adairs\\". Daisy was transferred from SoHo in New York City to join the group after Betty disappeared. Later on it is revealed that she was kicked out of New York for swindling the families of the recently deceased. Rube and several members of the Plague Division posed as police officers to break up her first con in Seattle, after which Rube told her he would not tolerate her doing this while working for him. Behind her bravado, however, she is lonely, an insight most clearly revealed in an episode where her final thoughts before death were recorded as being \\"Why has no one ever loved me?\\". Her loose work ethic irks Rube greatly, though he never punishes her for it. Daisy and George first become enemies when Daisy takes over for Betty, whom George liked immensely. Daisy then forces herself into George's apartment and even kicks her out of her own bed. Slowly, George realizes Daisy's demeanor is a front and warms to her slightly. Daisy responds by toning down her arrogant behavior. The two become friends by the end of the series, especially after Mason gives them his house to stay in. Daisy and Mason have a rocky relationship because he is madly in love with her but her insecurities, expressed through sexuality, interfere with any type of loving relationship. Mason goes so far as to buy Daisy an engagement ring after she reveals to him that she long ago accepted that she would never get married, and though she refused to wear the ring on her hand, she kept it on a necklace for the remainder of the series. It is implied that she continues to have feelings for Mason, but the extent is never known. In the episode \\"Be Still My Heart,\\" Daisy reacts badly to the death of a woman at the hands of a man who is tired of having her as a mistress. Visibly shaken by the events, Daisy implicates the murderer and then leaves the victim's soul behind at the scene, infuriating Roxy. Daisy ends the episode and explains her bizarre behavior by asking Mason, \\"Did I ever tell you I had a sister?\\" This may imply that a similar situation happened to Daisy's sister. Daisy met Ray Summers in the episode \\"Death Defying\\" and began dating him. In the episode \\"Forget Me Not\\", Daisy ended their relationship and Ray turned nasty, grabbing her by the throat and slamming her into the wall. Mason killed Ray in Daisy's defense. Mason was extremely upset by his actions and by the fact that \\"there's no Post-It\\", i.e. Ray was not scheduled to die then. To Mason's horror, a Graveling emerges from Ray's body, and Daisy says that she has seen that happen before. Mason buries Ray's body in the backyard. The Ray Graveling appears to retain some of Ray's personality or memories, as it hangs around Daisy and George's house and appears angry at Daisy, who begins drinking because of her feelings of guilt over his death. It even accompanies Daisy on one of her reaps, causing the unscheduled death of an innocent bystander. When the Ray Graveling menaces a sleeping Mason, George, who is unafraid of it, reaps the Graveling, who then disintegrates into dust. This Graveling was lighter in color than other Gravelings. The police search for Ray, but Roxy covers for Mason and Daisy as she understands something is wrong. Daisy is played by Sarah Wynter in the 2009 Direct to DVD movie Dead Like Me: Life After Death. Harris and Wynter previously portrayed sisters in the second season of the show 24. Betty Rhomer Betty Rhomer (Rebecca Gayheart) died by jumping off a cliff into a river without realizing its height. She was a spunky woman who \\"can't sit still for very long\\", and disappeared after following a soul into his great beyond, not long after befriending George. Her disappearance into the great beyond was never fully explained in the series, as it appears to go against the rules for a reaper to \\"gain their lights\\". Her character was written out and replaced with Daisy at the direction of MGM due to the actress's real-life legal problems and their apparent discomfort of her role as a reaper.Reflections: Talking with Bryan Fuller at CBR News On November 27, 2001, Gayheart pleaded no contest to vehicular manslaughter. She was sentenced to three years of probation, a one- year suspension of her license, a $2,800 fine, and 750 hours of community service.Rebecca Gayheart Biography at Yahoo! Movies people.com Ex-'90210' Star: Wrongful Death Suit The parents of the boy filed a wrongful death lawsuit, which was settled out of court. She was known for sometimes using 1920s phrases. She had conversations with George about using aliases in the past. Her trademark was taking a Polaroid photo of the people whose souls she took while saying \\"Happy Thoughts!\\", and classifying those people by personality type. In the same way, George later classified Betty as \\"mysterious and reassuring\\". Betty's gravestone shows the year of her death as 1926. In the episode \\"Curious George\\", we see Betty robbing her own grave and removing from the finger of her corpse a ring. In the episode \\"Reaping Havoc\\", George sees the ring and tells Betty she likes it. Betty replies, \\"I saw it in the Village in 1927; my boy bought it for me\\", a recollection at odds with her tombstone date. George's family =Joy Lass= Joy Lass (Cynthia Stevenson), born 1961, is George's mother. Described by George as a Virgo and a career legal secretary who enjoys ice skating and John Grisham novels, Joy is organized, neurotic, and a bit foul-mouthed. She hates the word \\"moist\\" because she thinks it sounds pornographic and is afraid of balloons. George observed that her mother's name is an ironic misnomer, noting, \\"Who had the nerve to name you 'Joy'?\\" The aftermath of George's death was made worse for Joy by her husband's infidelity and her difficulty communicating with her remaining daughter. She eventually divorces Clancy; the terms of the divorce apparently left Joy with sole ownership and possession of the family residence at 3851 Beatrice Lane (the location of which is revealed in the first-season episode \\"Nighthawks\\"). Joy also confided to George (as Millie) that she does not think she was a very good mother. Unable to afford the childhood home of Georgia and Reggie, Joy began scouting with Reggie for other accommodations‚Äîas a result of which she met and began dating Angelo. Her ex-husband, however, had been recently dumped by the woman with whom he cheated and, upon realizing Joy was dating, set out to sabotage his ex-wife's romantic plans. Clancy confessed in a later episode he missed her and the life he had with his family. Joy is very disturbed by Reggie's fixation over George's death, and starts to worry about Reggie's sanity. In \\"Forget Me Not\\", she applied for job placement through Happy Time, where her r√©sum√© states that she was a history major at college with a business minor, worked for two law firms, and knows Gregg shorthand and medical shorthand. Five years after George's death, Joy's disposition has made a significant change. Her neurotic nature and strict housekeeping requirements seem to have toned down. She has written a book based on her personal loss and counsels parents of deceased children. =Clancy Lass= Clancy Lass (Greg Kean), born c. 1960, is George's father and a Cancer. He is a tenured professor of English at the University of Washington. In \\"Pilot\\", George notes that he hugs another man for a long time which was part of a scrapped plot-line in which he was homosexual. George becomes friends with a student, Charlotte, after a reap at the college where her father teaches, and unwittingly encourages Charlotte to meet Clancy outside of class. They later begin an affair. Charlotte dumped him before \\"Be Still My Heart\\". He has vaguely implied wanting to come back to Joy in Season 2, but she rejected this overture. Five years after George's death, Clancy has moved far away from his ex-wife and surviving daughter and had started a new family. =Reggie Lass= Regina \\"Reggie\\" Lass (Britt McKillip), born c. 1992, is George's younger sister, largely ignored by George before her death. Like George, she is intelligent and well-read, but rather difficult and emotionally complex. After George's death, Reggie developed a fixation with the way her sister died. She collected toilet seats and put them in a tree. After passing this stage, she grows distant from her mother, and is in danger of becoming even more disaffected with life than her late sister. Reggie is opposed to Joy's decision to sell the family home: she told prospective buyers, \\"George visits me here\\" ‚Äî which is, in fact, true as she has spotted George (as Millie) spying on the house from time to time. Despite her stressed relationship with her mother, she is very protective of her and scared away one potential suitor by claiming that George was murdered in her own home. In \\"Ashes To Ashes\\", she experimented with the Goth lifestyle, adopting the nickname \\"Spider\\". When J.F. the frog was left on her doorstep following the death of her dog J.D., she became convinced (correctly) that George was responsible. She used to believe that George was a ghost, but has abandoned that notion (or pretends to have). Even though she is unsure of George's whereabouts, she (again, correctly) believes George is still \\"living\\" somehow, and in \\"Haunted\\", her beliefs were apparently confirmed when she saw George face-to-face. At the end of season 2, she appeared to have been gradually warming up to her mother, Joy. In the Dead Like Me film, Reggie is now a 16-year-old and has a better relationship with her mother. She is socially awkward and insecure, but secretly dates a popular high-school athlete who appears to be more in love with Reggie than his public girlfriend, but they only see each other in secret. After the boy is hospitalized following a severe car accident, she runs into George (appearing as Millie) multiple times. She thinks George is stalking her and confronts her, but instead finds out this strange, mysterious woman is in fact, her sister. During this time, George and Reggie begin to bond and be the sisters they were not when George was alive. Later, she wants to move in with the dead George, who demurs, calling it ill-advised. After George reaps Reggie's boyfriend, Reggie attempts to kill herself. After George stops her, Reggie realizes she should stop seeing George. Accepting that, she visits George's grave one more time, before urging Joy to move to a new location. Joy suggests they go on a vacation. Reggie is last seen staring out the window of the car as she and her mother leave for vacation. She sees George parked near the house, smiling at her as they drive by. =Phyllis= Phyllis (Barbara Barrie). \\"Grandma Phyl\\", Joy's mother, is constantly at odds with Joy, who considers Phyllis selfish. Where Joy is a compulsive, worrying, neat-freak, Phyllis is laid-back, worry-free, and seems to live day-to-day. She practices Buddhism. She participated in the various progressive movements during the 1960s at the expense, Joy believes, of her responsibilities, her husband, and daughter. Reggie appears to be fascinated by her, and Phyllis was apparently very close to George. Phyllis and Joy have a confrontational relationship. Joy felt abandoned by her mother as a child and resents Phyllis' disinterest in providing a stable home life. Happy Time =Delores Herbig= Delores Herbig (Christine Willes) \\"as in 'her big brown eyes'\\" (or as George once said \\"as in 'her big fat ass'\\" and \\"her big strange heart\\"). Delores is George's boss at Happy Time. She is highly obsessive-compulsive, which manifests in her dedication to propriety, correctness, and rules, and her artificial perkiness, which she believes to be the \\"right\\" attitude and tries very hard to maintain. She disliked George, but she displays a high appreciation for \\"Millie\\", both professionally and emotionally, and even goes so far as to model George's personnel file after her after Joy requests a copy. She occasionally mentions things from her past, such as having a cocaine habit in the 1980s, having her tattoos removed, and having restraining orders against her, which contrast with her current personality. She runs a webcam show from her apartment called Getting Things Done with Delores. She seems very happy and positive but is in fact quite sad and lonely, and is looking for a long-term relationship via online dating. In the Dead Like Me film, Delores is still George's boss. Delores's perky veneer finally breaks down at the death of her beloved cat, Murray. =Crystal= Crystal Smith (Crystal Dahl). Crystal is the receptionist at Happy Time, also known as Jane Smith. She can be very strange, and George initially finds her intimidating when she stares frequently at George and anyone else for long periods and she often refuses interaction, though the two eventually establish a rapport. She has a lookalike boyfriend at Happy Time (also played by Crystal Dahl). How much she knows about George and the other Reapers is never fully revealed in the series. After seeing Millie and possibly recognizing her as George (due to its being Halloween) she looked up files regarding George, after Mason and \\"Millie\\" had left, but she finds that the files are unavailable. She has a closet full of Post-its which she steals from work. In \\"Vacation\\", she actually helped the Reapers complete some long overdue Reaper- related paperwork, but gave no indication to them whether she understood exactly what it was all about. Her Happy Time file shows that she speaks Spanish, French, Russian and Swahili, and that she served with the Special Forces in Southeast Asia. =Misty= Misty Favreaux (Meghan Black). Misty is a co-worker of George's at Happy Time, known for her promiscuity. She said she works 35 hours a week, spends 34 of those hours thinking about sex, and the other hour having it. According to her confidential Happy Time file, she attended the Wheeling School of the Arts where she was voted the most popular student. She claims to have two children, Sassoon and Jordache, and to be married in Louisiana and possibly Kansas. The actress Meghan Black played a bank teller in the pilot episode, though this character is not Misty. Other living =Angus Cook= Angus Cook (John Kapelos). Angus Cook appeared the episodes \\"My Room\\" and \\"A Cook\\" as a line cook who had fallen into tough times because of a pyramid scheme where he lost everything. He disliked criticism about the food he prepared and passed this philosophy along to Rube, who reaped him and subsequently took over in the kitchen. Angus‚Äô spirit remained to coach Rube in the kitchen and pass along his philosophy that the cook should not bow to the demands of the customer. When Rube accepted this, only then did Angus pass on. =Kiffany= Kiffany (Patricia Idlette). Kiffany is the Reapers' regular waitress at Der Waffle Haus, and meets the odd goings on among the Reapers (bizarre conversations about death; Roxy shooting Mason in the foot; Mason committing a \\"lewd act\\" with a coconut slice) with extraordinary sang-froid. She has shown sympathetic interest in the characters, but never pries. She described Rube as a special customer, perhaps because he gives a $2 tip on a $7 breakfast. She seems to like George, as she gave her free oatmeal for her patience (\\"Hurry\\"). In the episode \\"Always\\", she banned Mason from Der Waffle Haus for stealing tips, relenting after he apologized and giving him money. She has evidently worked there for some time, as she knows Penny, another Reaper. Kiffany claims to have psychic powers (although she doesn't go out of her way to tell people about it). She reads palms, and in a Season Two deleted scene, became visibly upset upon examining George's lifeline, refusing to discuss it with her even after George begged her to. Being the Reapers‚Äô server since the first season, she has indicated she knows that Rube's group has unusual secrets. In the episode \\"Haunted\\", Kiffany doesn't seem fazed by the fact that the Reapers appear as they were when they were alive. =Trip Hesburgh= Thomas \\"Trip\\" Hesburgh III (Robin Dunne). Journalist; George's first serious relationship. George found herself liking Trip a great deal, and became extremely upset when she thought that Trip was her reap, Thomas Hesburgh Jr, though it was soon revealed that Trip was Thomas Hesburgh III and she was supposed to reap Trip's father instead. He seems very unhappy despite being raised in a wealthy family, and seems tired of the social superficialities of his wealthy upbringing. He is often nagged by his older sister Ashley. He became George's first lover and called her his girlfriend, but it is uncertain whether any sort of relationship will actually develop. After spending the night with George, he never called or sought her out again, sending George into a rage. He and Ashley know George by her real name (rather than by her Millie alias), a revelation which Mason chides her for (although all the other reapers introduce themselves to the living with their real names throughout the series). =Angelo= Angelo (Peter Williams). Angelo owns a loft apartment that Joy and Reggie looked at in \\"In Escrow\\", and is briefly Joy's love interest. He is smooth-talking, urbane, and artistically talented. He somehow knew that the Lass dog was a golden retriever without ever having been told. =Ray Summers= Ray Summers (Eric McCormack) d. 2004. Ray was a reality television producer who struck up a romantic relationship with Daisy when she met him during an assignment in \\"Death Defying\\". He came off as extremely obnoxious and overbearing and was disliked by Rube, George, and especially Mason. Ray disliked Mason, identifying him as a rival for Daisy's affections. He was manipulative and abusive towards Daisy. Unknown to Daisy, Ray had a criminal record that included assault and fraud charges. He was killed by Mason when he attacked Daisy. Mason claimed, \\"The first [hit] was in self defense, but the next three were a bit murderous.\\" Ray's soul became a Graveling after his death, and stayed near Daisy, causing her to sink into depression because of her feelings of guilt over Ray's death. The Ray Graveling was particularly malevolent, following Daisy to one of her reaps and causing the unscheduled death of an innocent bystander, which affected Daisy even more. In \\"Always\\", the Ray Graveling was reaped by George, turning into dust and disintegrating. =Charlotte= Charlotte (A. J. Cook). Charlotte is a university student. She and George met in \\"Sunday Mornings\\", after Mason saved her from being raped. They became friends, and she took George to her course on the sonnets taught by George's father, Clancy. She begins a relationship with Clancy, but breaks up with him (off camera) sometime before the episode \\"Be Still My Heart\\". Other undead =Charlie= Charlie, the pet Reaper (Spencer Achtymichuk) (1988‚Äì1997) was hit by a drunk driver. A young boy, Charlie has appeared three times to reap pets, one of which was George's family's dog. He encountered both George and Reggie. Reggie attempted to befriend him, while George asked him where he lived, and gave him some money when he replied \\"just here and there\\". Charlie is one of the few Reapers who regularly refer to George as \\"Toilet Seat Girl\\", much to her annoyance. A young girl is portrayed as being another pet Reaper in Dead Like Me: Life After Death. =Penny= Penny (Yeardley Smith) died 1912 in the Titanic disaster, after which she developed a dislike of ice (even in beverages). Penny used to be a member of Rube's group in \\"External Influences\\", and now works for \\"Natural Causes\\", based upon how reapers are assigned to their division (see The Lawn Bowlers), it is logical to assume she either drowned or died from hypothermia (though hypothermia is more likely). She first appeared in \\"Forget Me Not\\" when George had a reap at the hospital. In \\"Always\\", she showed Rube the Post-It for his daughter Rosie, and allowed him to accompany her to the nursing home where Rosie stayed, giving him a few minutes to visit his daughter before her death. She seems to get on well with Kiffany (who does not seem to comment on the fact she hasn't aged) and also seems well liked by Roxy and Mason. She had not previously met Daisy or George. Her usual drink is iced tea without the ice. =Plague Division= Pete and Company. Pete and two other unnamed male reapers were seen in the episode \\"Unfinished Business\\". Pete is a police detective and the other two are beat cops. According to Pete, they have nothing but time on their hands as they work in the \\"Plague Division\\". Pete and his friends give Rube a hand to break up Daisy's s√©ance scam in the aforementioned episode, getting shot several times by Rube. A humorous conversation about what sort of bullets hurt the most follows. The Lawn Bowlers. On the deleted scenes section of the First Season DVD (and later shown on Scifi Channel during their run), Mason and George are in a park, and notice several members of the Plague Division involved in a game of lawn bowling. During this scene, Mason explains how reapers are assigned to their division; since the lawn bowlers died of the Plague, they are assigned to the Plague Division. However, they've been out of work for the last 600 years, since no one dies from Plague anymore. George suggests that some other disease may come up, such as Ebola, when the bowlers notice a squirrel approach a pair of picnickers. Mason tells George they're expressing interest because squirrels were carriers of the Plague and thought if one of the picnickers was bit, there could be a new outbreak. =The unnamed person= This nameless, silent individual, seen mostly at the opening and closing of Rube's elevator door, delivers to him the names of those about to die in a manila envelope. In one episode it is seen as an actual shadow, and the envelope only became corporeal when it slid across the threshold of Rube's apartment. This person or being's identity and rank in death's hierarchy have never been revealed. Rube has attempted to coax this person into revealing him/her/itself by cooking it a traditional Italian meal and is usually respectful of its visits, only picking up the envelope after it has walked away from his door. On one occasion, however, Rube followed the shadow toward the elevator, complaining about Angus Cook at Der Waffel Haus, whom Rube had befriended, being on the list. When Betty Rohmer jumped after a soul into the afterlife, Rube left a post-it on the door asking the person, \\"What happened to her?\\", though it is unknown if he ever received an answer. Animals =J.D.= J.D., d. 2004. One of George's reaps left behind J.D., a Golden Retriever in \\"A Cook\\". George agreed to take care of the dog and tried to keep him, but soon passed him on to her family. Reggie decided that J.D. stands for \\"Just Dog\\". He seemed fond of Clancy. In \\"Last Call\\", he was killed by a car, after Charlie had reaped his soul. =Mr. Blinky= J.F. formerly known as Mr. Frog and Mr. Blinky by his original owner, is a yellow frog that belonged to George's first reap, a young girl, and which apparently followed George home. Following the death of J.D., George secretly left the frog with Reggie, who dubbed it J.F. for \\"Just Frog\\" and is convinced the frog came from George. The frog, along with other frog imagery, has been used from time to time to symbolize the cycle of life and death, a recurring motif responding to George's tale about the origins of death, from the beginning of the pilot episode. =Murray= Murray is Delores Herbig's aging cat. He requires dialysis three times a week, and has bladder problems. Despite the nuisances of his aging, Delores loves him greatly and is distraught in an episode where he falls ill. This is the episode where George first meets Charlie, realizing what he is from the Post-It in his comic book. She warns Delores not to let him touch Murray; Charlie reaps a rabbit instead, telling Delores that he thinks Murray will be just fine. Murray dies in the Dead Like Me movie, and ashes reported to be his are blasted into space. The urn actually contains the ashes of Cameron Kane; whether it contains Murray's ashes as well is unclear.

The NFDW was established in 1971 as a means of supporting women‚Äôs voices within the Democratic Party of the United States. The NFDW hosts national and state-level conferences and activities. The NFDW is a recognized constituent group of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and therefore has three seats on the DNC and the president of NFDW is part of the executive committee of the DNC. The NFDW has 37 chapters around the country and looks to expand to every state and protectorate.  History  The National Federation of Democratic Women was formed on October 6, 1971, when 27 women gathered at breakfast during the Democratic Women's Leadership Conference at the Capitol Hilton in Washington, D.C. Rilla Moran was elected temporary chair and the group set May 1972, Nashville, Tennessee, as the first annual meeting. Rilla Moran (from Tennessee) was elected the first President of the Federation at the May 1972 meeting and served until 1977 when Jean Ohm of South Dakota was elected President. At this convention, the women of the Federation established the Founders Internship for a young woman between the ages of 18 and 25 to work at the Democratic National Committee. During the period 1972-1977, the Federation gained recognition from the Democratic National Committee as the official women's organization and received a seat on the DNC Executive Committee and three seats on the DNC. Rilla Moran Woods, C. DeLores Tucker and Caroline Wilkins were instrumental in establishing this official recognition for NFDW through their work on the Charter Commission and the 1976 Democratic National Convention Committee.

Biography Born in Chaumont, France, Despradelle was admitted to the Ecole des Beaux-Arts at age twenty, was educated in the atelier of Jean-Louis Pascal, and obtained his diploma in 1886. He won the Grand Prix de Rome in 1889. In 1893, Despradelle went to Boston, accepting a position as Professor of Design at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he served until his death. He taught the Beaux-Arts style and thus influenced the style's continued use throughout North America and Europe until about 1920. Among architects who studied under him were the Canadians George Allen Ross, William Sutherland Maxwell and Andrew R. Cobb. American architects who trained under him included Francis M. Miller, Ellis Lawrence,Ellis Lawrence Accessed March 6, 2007 Marion Mahony, Ida Annah Ryan, Rose Standish Nichols and Raymond Hood.Raymond Hood Accessed March 6, 2007 A contemporary anecdote in the MIT student paper The Tech may give some indication of his manner and personality: \\"The Lounge [a column in the paper] secured the services of Mr. Derby as interpreter, and thus equipped sought an audience with Professor Despradelles. After an excited conversation of about fifteen minutes Mr. Derby reported in full to The Lounge as follows, 'Mr. Despradelles says that Sunday is a curious American custom'.\\"MIT, The Tech, Volume 22, October 9, 1902 Despradelle was an architect of the early buildings and grounds of the University of California, and served on its advisory board. In Boston he maintained a practice called Codman and Despradelle with his business partner, Stephen Codman. Among their best-known projects is the Berkeley Building on Boylston Street, Boston, now a US national landmark. Despradelle died in his home in Boston after a long illness. Beacon of Progress Depiction of the facade of the Despradelle Monument or the Beacon of Progress as envisioned circa 1904. Note the scale as indicated by the figures at lower right. Despradelle's most famous project was the unrealized \\"Beacon of Progress\\" (also simply called \\"the Beacon\\"). The Beacon was a towering monument intended for the site in Chicago, Illinois of the Columbian Exposition of 1893. Despradelle designed the Beacon to represent the founding of America, and so it consisted of thirteen obelisks which he said represented the original thirteen colonies. The group of obelisks merged to form a single spire soaring 1,500 feet (approximately 457 metres) above Chicago. This is similar to the height of the Sears Tower, built in the city in 1973. The Beacon would also represent the future with its benefits to be drawn from \\"technological leaps forward\\" in the approaching century. At the apex was to be a brilliant beacon of light with a figurative sculpture called Spirit of Progress to embody what Despradelle called the upward-looking Christian in America. The figure would face Lake Michigan as a monument to the genius of the people and to the dominant feature of their life.MIT, The Beacon , The Technology Review, Volume 20, Issue 1 - October 4, 1900. Retrieved on 2008-08-21. Despradelle continued to refine his design after the Exposition was over, and although the Beacon was never built, the strength of his final 1900 drawings \\"drew a great deal of attention and had a lasting impact\\" in the Francophone world. Those drawings retained by the French government from domestically-hosted exhibitions were included in the 1908 Franco-British Exhibition in London, a \\"tribute to [this] teacher of so many upcoming architects, but also recognition and understanding of Despradelle's creative vision.\\" Other works Despradelle's other architectural works (in collaboration with Stephen Codman as Codman & Despradelle) include: * Austin Biscuit Company Bakery (later Stop & Shop Bakery), Boston, 1902,Public and Private Preservation Initiatives, historicboston.org \\"Intercontinental Renovates the Causeway,\\" Feb. 1, 2003, Intercontinental Real Estate Corporation renovated in 2004 by Finegold Alexander + Associates Inc as The Causeway/Strada 234 condominium\\"The Causeway/Strada 234,\\" Finegold Alexander + Associates Inc website * The Berkeley Building, Boston, 1905,\\"The Berkeley Building,\\" Dateline: Boston 1905 also renovated by FA+A Inc\\"The Berkeley Building,\\" Finegold Alexander + Associates Inc website eley * Peter Bent Brigham Hospital, Boston, 1913, now part of Brigham & Women's Hospital  Notes  References * Mark Jarzombek.

It has been represented by Democrat Brendan Boyle since 2019. The district is demographically diverse, with about 39% of residents identifying as white, nearly 27% of residents identifying as black, 26% identifying as Hispanic or Latino (of any race), and 8% identifying as Asian.https://www2.census.gov/geo/maps/cong_dist/cd116/cd_based/ST42/CD116_PA02.pdf Prior to 2018, the district covered West Philadelphia, North Philadelphia, and Northwest Philadelphia, as well as parts of South Philadelphia, Center City, and western suburbs such as Lower Merion Township in Montgomery County. Before the 113th Congress, the district did not contain Lower Merion Township but instead contained Cheltenham Township. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania redrew the district in February 2018 after ruling the previous map unconstitutional due to partisan gerrymandering. The new second district is essentially the successor to the previous first district. As such, it remained heavily Democratic for the 2018 election and representation thereafter. Brendan Boyle, the incumbent from the previous 13th district, ran for re- election in the new 2nd district. Parts of the previous second district were shifted to the third. Congressman Chaka Fattah represented the district from 1995 to 2016. On July 29, 2015, Fattah and a group of associates were indicted on federal charges related to their alleged roles in a racketeering and influence peddling conspiracy. On April 26, 2016, Dwight Evans toppled Fattah in a competitive Democratic primary election. Fattah resigned June 23, 2016. Evans then won a special election to fill Fattah's seat. He also won election for the regular term beginning January 3, 2017. Evans won re-election in the new 3rd congressional district.

Available from the Faculty of Science and Technology at Ryukoku University. This concept was introduced by sociologist Arlie Russell Hochschild in 1979. Hochschild's 1983 book, \\"The Managed Heart: Commercialization of Human Feeling,\\" discusses feeling rules in greater depth, especially in the occupational worlds of flight attendants and bill collectors. Hochschild draws on the work of sociologist Erving Goffman as well as labor scholar Harry Braverman to discuss the dramaturgical demands and emotional labor entailed by jobs in the service sector, in which workers must \\"perform\\" certain roles that entail abiding by certain feeling rules (e.g. \\"friendly and dependable\\"). She notes that women are more likely to have such jobs than men, and that analysis of feeling rules may therefore be especially relevant to understanding the gendered dimensions of labor. This work foreshadows themes from her later analyses of women's work, both paid and unpaid, e.g. in \\"The Commercialization of Intimate Life\\" (2003). This work is part of the broader sociology of emotions, which notes that socialization plays an important role in how people experience, interpret, and express emotions, including the situations that evoke a range of feelings. All human beings learn certain feeling rules, but these feeling rules may differ widely depending on the society in which one grows up and one's social position and social identity, including gender and ethnic identity and socio-economic status. Feeling rules are flexible and the ways in which they impinge on one's experience in different settings influences one's personality, both in specific contexts (e.g. at work, home, school, or in different social groups) and over time. Available from the University of Regina.  Effects  =Race and the workplace= Race not only plays an important role in the way that employees act with each other, but also how employees act toward customers based on what race they are associated with. People expect others to behave in a certain manner due to what race they identify or associate with. Race influences and changes the way we see and view others. Roxana Harlow, a sociologist, conducted extensive research on black colleges and professors. Harlow's research showed that white college students viewed their professors as \\"unintelligent\\" and \\"inferior\\" simply because of the color of their skin and not the measurement of their knowledge. In a classroom setting, white students were shown to give black professors a hard time and question every statement that their professor made. Whereas, if they were in a classroom with a white professor that had made the same statement that a black professor had made previously, the white professor was not questioned and was viewed as knowledgeable. In spite of this baseless challenge to their authority, the black professor maintained their composure and adhered to the feeling rules demanded by the setting. In a workplace, feeling rules are established and are expected to be followed, but there is a double standard on the feeling rules applied to the white workers versus black workers. =Status= Due to feeling rules, people of lower status or standing are expected to behave in an ashamed or emotional manner versus a cold or angry manner. By showing that they are ashamed of their current standing, the people of higher status are more likely to help them out and have pity on them versus those who do not show shame or pity for their current state. People respond better to seeing people on the streets asking for money or rambling through trash to find items. People of higher standings respond back by giving that individual of lower status clothes, food, and money. Our generosity is dependent on the manner of the poor individual. A poor individual who acted in an indifferent or prissy manner would not receive any response from the financially stable individual, not because his or her current situation had changed, in fact that person is still the poor individual you saw a few minutes ago, but in fact your demeanor had changed due to feeling rules. Feeling rules gives people the expectancy that individuals of lower status should act in a pitiful and ashamed manner just because of their standing. Feeling rules affect our status because it dictates how one should act just because of their economic/ financial standing. An experiment was conducted to show how people would react if they saw an ad with a person who was angry about being poor and another person who was shameful about being in poverty. After viewing the ad, people were more willingly to give money to the person who ashamed about being poor versus the person who was angry about being poor. Since the individual who was angry about being in poverty broke the feeling rule of what is expected our people of lower class, little to none donations were received in their favor. People of lower status that displayed no sense of self-pity or dissatisfaction gave people of higher status a harder time to sympathize with them thus proving that expressing shame was more effective and when anger was expressed there was little to no help being provided. = Gender = Around the world, males get paid more than females. Feeling rules require men and women to act a certain way, and in fear of breaking that norm, these rules stay in place. Women are associated with being sweet and innocent, whereas men are associated with being tough and strong. People are assigned jobs based on their gender. Since women are usually seen as beings that can control their anger, they are most likely enlisted in jobs that require them to use their looks or charms. Men, who are seen as tough, are usually in jobs that require them to use that toughness or anger in order to deliver some type of means. Women in traditional and middle-class families rely on men to make or give them money. In response to the men providing, the women in a sense feel as if they have to repay the men back by hugging, kissing or celebrating the man. Since the women do not have the financial capability of repaying the man, the women use emotional means in order to thank or repay the man for what he has provided for them. If the man had provided the money for the woman and she in return did not act by hugging or kissing him, she would be seen an ungrateful because the feeling rules calls for her to feel joy or happiness for what the man has done for her. Children learn their habits and emotional skills from their parents. Men are seen as beings that are not capable of controlling their feelings or emotions because they were not taught or required to as a child. Males obtain jobs such as bill collector, taxi driver, and construction worker because many of those jobs do not rely heavily on emotional labor. Hochschild showed that male flight attendants showed more power and tolerated less abuse from passengers than female flight attendants. Since people generally associate males with being tough and associate females with being sweet, feeling rules makes them feel appalled when a women behaves in a tough manner, but when a male behaves in the same way, it is seen as acceptable.  Exploitation  A large portion of workers have jobs or careers that requires them to use their feelings, or \\"emotional labor\\" as Hochschild calls it, in the workplace. Their reactions and actions are based on the way they see how other people react or express their feelings. Companies and corporations see this and use it to exploit workers in order to maximize profits. Hochschild gives a clear example on how companies maximize their profits through the use of feeling rules by viewing the job of a flight attendant. A flight attendant's job requires emotional labor. The flight attendance uplifts the customer through his or her demeanor and expression of feelings. A flight attendant who is constantly smiling or asking the customer how they are doing is more comforting to a customer versus if a flight attendant who rolls their eyes and rarely smiles. The feeling rules for a flight attendant calls for them to be happy, calm, and to suppress their negative feelings. Customers who see the way the flight attendant upholds themselves are more likely to come back if the experience was pleasant. Which is why many airlines like Delta, which was rated as one of the top airlines calls and requires these feeling rules at the workplace. In a way, this is beneficial to the companies and the customer because the customer is satisfied and keeps coming back, which makes the company more money. However, at the same time, it can be harmful to the flight attendant because they are not able to express their feelings, but rather suppress their feelings for the benefit of others.

The Commission certified electronic health record technology from 2006 until 2014. It was approved by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as an Authorized Testing and Certification Body (ONC-ATCB). The CCHIT Certified program is an independently developed certification that includes a rigorous inspection of an EHR's integrated functionality, interoperability and security using criteria developed by CCHIT's broadly representative, expert work groups. These products may also be certified in the ONC-ATCB certification program. History CCHIT was founded in 2004 with support from three leading industry associations in healthcare information management and technology: the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA), the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) and the National Alliance for Health Information Technology (the Alliance). In September 2005, CCHIT was awarded a 3-year contract by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to develop and evaluate the certification criteria and inspection process for EHRs and the networks through which they interoperate. In October 2006, HHS officially designated CCHIT as a Recognized Certification Body (RCB).U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (October 26, 2006): HHS Officially Recognizes Certification Body to Evaluate Electronic Health Records In July 2010, HHS published new rules for recognizing testing and certification bodies, scheduled to take effect when it named the new bodies. In September 2010, the Office of the National Coordinator (ONC) of HHS named CCHIT again under these new rules. CCHIT is an ONC Authorized Testing and Certification Body (ONC-ATCB). Goals * Reduce the risk of Healthcare Information Technology (HIT) investment by physicians and other providers * Ensure interoperability (compatibility) of HIT products * Assure payers and purchasers providing incentives for electronic health records (EHR) adoption that the ROI will be improved quality * Protect the privacy of patients' personal health information. Operations CCHIT focused its first efforts on ambulatory EHR productsPublic postings of CCHIT work products for the ambulatory domain for the office-based physician and provider and began commercial certification in May 2006. CCHIT then developed a process of certification for inpatient EHR productsPublic postings of CCHIT work products for the inpatient domain and launched that program in 2007. CCHIT then assessed the need for, and potential benefit of, certifying EHR for specialty medicine, special care settings, and special-needs populations.CCHIT to Expand Electronic Health Record Certification to Some Specialties (November 28, 2006)CCHIT: Certifying EHR for Specialty Medicine and Special Care Settings CCHIT, in a collaboration with the MITRE Corporation, also developed an open-source program called Laika to test EHR software for compliance with federally named interoperability standards. In January 2014, Information Week reported that CCHIT would exit the EHR certification business. On November 14, 2014, CCHIT ceased all operations.

Commissioners The Commission, chaired by Karen Bell, M.D., M.M.S, was composed of 21 members each serving two-year terms. Stakeholders Certified EHR products benefit many interested groups and individuals: * Physicians, hospitals, health care systems, safety net providers, public health agencies and other purchasers of HIT products, who seek quality, interoperability, data portability and security * Purchasers and payers ‚Äì from government to the private sector ‚Äì who are prepared to offer financial incentives for HIT adoption but need the assurance of having a mechanism in place to ensure that products deliver the expected benefits * Quality improvement organizations that seek out an efficient means of measuring that criteria have been assessed and met * Standards development and informatics experts that gain consensus on standards * Vendors who benefit from having to meet a single set of criteria and from having a voice in the process * Healthcare consumers, ultimately the most important stakeholders, who will benefit from a reliable, accurate and secure record of their health CCHIT and its volunteer work groups strove to fairly represent the interests of each of these diverse groups in an open forum, communicating the progress of its work and seeking input from all quarters. CCHIT received the endorsements of a number of professional medical organizations, including the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Physicians, the Physicians' Foundation for Health Systems Excellence and Physicians' Foundation for Health Systems Innovation.

Written by Brian Wilson and Mike Love, the recording's use of layering, reverb and delay effects led it to be retrospectively cited as the earliest example of chillwave and a precursor to the shoegazing genre. Composition \\"All I Wanna Do\\" was written by the band's Brian Wilson and Mike Love. The arrangement features the use of 12-string guitar, Rocksichord, electric sitar, drums, double bass, electric bass, piano, shaker, and Moog synthesizer. According to academic Philip Lambert, Talking about the song in 1995, Brian expressed: \\"That was one of those songs that had a nice chord pattern, but I think it was a boring song, and I thought it wasn't done right. I thought it should have been softer, with boxed guitars.\\" In 2000, he called the song \\"a real nice one\\". In 2015, Love commented that \\"All I Wanna Do\\" was \\"totally poetic and quite heartfelt\\". Recording Carl Wilson (pictured 1969) produced the song's recording sessions, sang backing vocals, and played the lead guitar line \\"All I Wanna Do\\" was produced by Carl Wilson, likely with assistance from Brian, at various professional studios, including the band's own private studio. On February 24, 1968, an early version of the song was recorded during the Friends sessions. Another version was recorded on May 24 and June 8. One of these versions, which makes use of the sitar-like instrument, appears on the 2018 compilation: I Can Hear Music: The 20/20 Sessions. Another session for the song took place on March 19, 1969, at Gold Star Studios. The final arrangement opted for a guitar line which Mathew Greenwald of AllMusic describes as \\"Byrds-like\\". Heavy reverb was applied to the mix. Carl played 12-string guitar, Rocksichord, and electric sitar, while engineer Stephen Desper played Moog synthesizer. The remaining instrumentalist roles were filled in by various session musicians. The vocals were recorded at the band's studio, as overdubs onto the Gold Star track, and feature all six members, with Love handling the lead. Legacy In 1970, Jim Miller of Rolling Stone noted production elements made the listening experience \\"mind- wrenching\\". Greenwald called the song a lost classic, writing: \\"Possibly one of the most beautiful and unusual songs and recordings on the Sunflower album... Mike Love deserves high marks for his vocal and lyric contributions, which may be his most tasteful in the scope of the entire Beach Boys canon. Brian Wilson's haunting, minor-key melody and ghostly arrangement is truly bittersweet evidence that he had certainly not lost his artistic grasp.\\" Greenwald afforded accolades to the song's arrangement, citing the effectiveness of the piccolo snare drum and the well-executed harmonies. A 2016 reader's poll conducted by Rolling Stone ranked it the fourth-best Beach Boys song that was not a hit record. In later years, the song was cited as the origin of the shoegaze and chillwave genres. In his retrospective review of Sunflower, Pitchforks Hefner Macauley acknowledged the song as a work of \\"proto-shoegaze\\" and as a standout track on the album. Katie Cameron of Paste concurred that the song was an \\"undeniably cool shoegazing precursor\\". The band never performed the song in concert. In 2015, Mike Love's touring version of the Beach Boys briefly began playing the song live for the first time. Personnel Credits sourced from Beach Boys archivist Craig Slowinski.

It has been represented by Democrat Dwight Evans since 2019. According to the Cook PVI, it is the 3rd most Democratic district in all of the US. Prior to 2018, the district was located in the northwestern part of the state and included the cities of Erie, Sharon, Hermitage, Butler and Meadville. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania redrew this district in February 2018 after ruling the previous map unconstitutional. The new third district is similar to the old second district and was heavily Democratic for the 2018 election and representation thereafter. Dwight Evans, the incumbent from the old 2nd district, ran for re-election in the new 3rd District. The district supported President George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004 as well as John McCain in 2008. Prior to redistricting in 2002, the district was located in Northeast Philadelphia and was represented by Rep. Robert Borski.

These levels constitute a taxonomy of theories (a grammar of a natural language being an example of such a theory) according to potency. This taxonomy might be extended to scientific theories in general, and from there even stretched into the realm of the aesthetics of art.An example of application of the levels to aesthetics may be found in the discussion at , accessed 2006-04-19. This present article's use of the phrase as a terminus technicus should not be confused with its everyday language uses. Motivation The \\"potency\\" criterion alluded to in the preceding section is somewhat ill-defined, but may include \\"exhaustiveness\\", \\"effectiveness', and an affective component as well. (Arguably, the taxonomy is also motivated by considerations of \\"elegance\\". This should not be confused with the application of the taxonomy in the field of aesthetics). As a metatheory, or \\"theory of theories\\", it becomes a concept of epistemology in the philosophy of science, rather than a mere tool or methodology of scientific linguistics. As Chomsky put it in an earlier work: > The theory of linguistic structure must be distinguished clearly from a > manual of helpful procedures for the discovery of grammars.Chomsky, 1957, p. > 106. The levels #Observational adequacy #*The theory achieves an exhaustive and discrete enumeration of the data points. #*There is a pigeonhole for each observation. #Descriptive adequacy #*The theory formally specifies rules accounting for all observed arrangements of the data. #*The rules produce all and only the well-formed constructs (relations) of the protocol space. #: > ...the grammar gives a correct account of the linguistic intuition of the > native speaker, and specifies the observed data (in particular) in terms of > significant generalizations that express underlying regularities in the > language.Chomsky 1964, p. 63 #Explanatory adequacy #*The theory provides a principled choice between competing descriptions. #*It deals with the uttermost underlying structure. #*It has predictive power. #: > A linguistic theory that aims for explanatory adequacy is concerned with the > internal structure of the device [i.e. grammar]; that is, it aims to provide > a principled basis, independent of any particular language, for the > selection of the descriptively adequate grammar of each language.Chomsky > 1964, p. 63. Theories which do not achieve the third level of adequacy are said to \\"account for the observations\\", rather than to \\"explain the observations.\\" The second and third levels include the assumption of Ockhamist parsimony. This is related to the Minimalist requirement,Chomsky, 1995. which is elaborated as a corollary of the levels, but which is actually employed as an axiom. Precursors in the philosophy of science It is suggested that the system of levels proposed by Chomsky in Aspects of the Theory of Syntax has its antecedents in the works of Descartes, Kant, Carnap, Quine, and others. Certainly the criterion of adequacy found in rationalism, specifically, rational empiricism, bear some resemblance to Chomsky's formulation. Since one of the key issues which Chomsky treats in Aspects is a supposition of a congenital endowment of the language faculty in humans, the topic ramifies into questions of innateness and a priori knowledge, since it is by reference to those questions that the third level of adequacy is to be sought. Note This concept should not to be confused with the \\"causal adequacy principle,\\" which refers to Descartes' version of the ontological argument for the existence of God in his Meditations on First Philosophy.

It was this 1876 masterpiece that ignited popular interest in butter sculpting as a public art form. The bowl was kept cool with ice underneath it. Butter sculptures are sculptures carved in butter. The works often depict animals, people, buildings and other objects. They are best known as attractions at state fairs in the United States as lifesize cows and people, but can also be found on banquet tables and even small decorative butter pats. Butter carving was an ancient craft in Tibet, Babylon, Roman Britain and elsewhere. The earliest documented butter sculptures date from Europe in 1536, where they were used on banquet tables. The earliest pieces in the modern sense as public art date from ca. 1870s America, created by Caroline Shawk Brooks, a farm woman from Helena, Arkansas. The heyday of butter sculpturing was about 1890-1930, but butter sculptures are still a popular attraction at agricultural fairs, banquet tables and as decorative butter patties. History The history of carving food into sculptured objects is ancient.Pamela H. Simpson. Butter Cows and Butter Buildings: A History of an Unconventional Sculptural Medium, Winterthur Portfolio 41, no. 1 (Spring 2007): 1-19. Archaeologists have found bread and pudding molds of animal and human shapes at sites from Babylon to Roman Britain.Phyllis Pray Bober, Art, Culture, and Cuisine: Ancient and Medieval Gastronomy (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1999), 66‚Äì67George C. Boon, \\"A Roman Pastry Cook‚Äôs Mould from Silchester\\", Antiquaries Journal 38 ( July 1958): 237‚Äì40. In Europe, during the Renaissance and Baroque periods molding food was commonly done for wealthy banquets. It was during this period that the earliest known reference to a butter sculpture is found. In 1536 Bartolomeo Scappi, cook to Pope Pius V, organized a feast composed of nine scenes elaborately carved out of food, each carried in episodically as centerpieces for a banquet. Scappi mentioned several butter sculptures for the feast, including an elephant with a palanquin, a figure of Hercules struggling with a lion, and a Moor on a camel.Bartolomeo Scappi, Opera (1570; Venice: Alessandro de Vecchi, 1622), cited in Visser, The Rituals of Dinner Another early reference is found in the biography of Antonio Canova (1757‚Äì1822), who said he first came to his patron‚Äôs attention when as a humble kitchen boy he sculpted an impressive butter lion for a banquet - the story is now thought apocryphal, though it reaffirms the existence of butter sculptures during that period. Butter sculpting continued into the 18th century when English dairy maids molded butter pats into decorative shapes. Caroline Shawk Brooks with a butter sculpture basrelief of Columbus for the 1893 Chicago Columbian Exposition. The earliest butter sculpture in the modern sense (as public art and not a banquet centerpiece) can be traced to the 1876 Centennial Exhibition where Caroline Shawk Brooks, a farm woman from Helena, Arkansas, displayed her Dreaming Iolanthe, a basrelief bust of a woman modeled in butter. It was kept cold with a system of layered bowls and frequent ice changes. Brooks had no formal art training but as a farmer she spent years making butter and in 1867, to make the work more interesting, she began sculpting it, eventually using it as a selling point. As her skills progressed she began to see it as more than marketing butter, indeed as an art form unto itself. In 1873 she made her masterpiece Dreaming Iolanthe, which she would re-do over the years at regional exhibitions around the US. Thus she was invited to bring a replica to the Centennial Exhibition in 1876 where it drew so much attention and praise she was invited to sculpt live for the crowds. Afterwards she studied in Paris and Florence and eventually became a professional sculptor who worked in marble, but occasionally continued to make butter art. She returned for the 1893 Chicago Columbian Exposition and made busts of Queen Isabella and Christopher Columbus. By then, however, there were other butter sculptors: the art form had come into its own. The heyday of butter sculpting was from about 1890 to 1930. During this period refrigeration became widely available, and the American dairy industry began promoting butter sculpture as a way to compete against synthetic butter substitute like Oleomargarine (margarine). Butter sculpting decreased during the Great Depression and WWII due to shortages but picked up again after the war. United States The first butter cow sculpture to appear at a state fair was displayed at the Ohio State Fair in 1903, sculpted by A. T. Shelton & Company. New cow and calf sculptures are created each year, reflecting positive ideals and cultural trends in Ohio, and have become a Fair tradition. Postcard of John K. Daniels‚Äôs butter sculpture of a boy, cow, and calf. Iowa State Fair, 1911. The first butter cow in Iowa was made by sculptor John K. Daniels at the 1911 Iowa State Fair. The sculpture was sponsored by the Beatrice Creamery Co., now part of Con-Agra Foods. The exhibit, designed as a way to promote dairy products in the area, was a big hit with fairgoers. Because of its success, the butter sculpture was continued each year. Over the years, several different artists have sculpted the Butter Cow for the Iowa State Fair. Daniels created sculptures and was followed by J.E. Wallace of Florida, who held the position until 1956. Wallace started making an additional butter sculpture for the exhibit each year. This second sculpture typically depicted people in everyday activities such as butter churning, or playing with a dog. This tradition has continued with each sculptor since. Earl Frank Dutt of Illinois became the third official sculptor. Dutt was trained at the Art Institute of Chicago and had experience sculpting many materials, from plaster and clay to lard. Over the next few years he sculpted cows in Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Michigan, spreading the love of the Butter Cow throughout the Midwest United States. His additions to each year's exhibit were far more cartoonish than those of J.E. Wallace, depicting such things as a fight between political party mascots or a parade of smiling pigs. It was Dutt who trained Norma \\"Duffy\\" Lyon, now known widely as The Butter Cow Lady. She began her career as an assistant to Frank Dutt in 1959. The previous year she saw a photo of Dutt's creation and told the fair director she could do better. In 1960, she took over as the sculptor in residence‚Äîand first female to do so‚Äîand created a new piece for the fair each year until 2005. Some of her more notable sculptures include likenesses of Garth Brooks, John Wayne, Elvis Presley, and her own full version of The Last Supper, all made of butter. Duffy (a nickname derived from her maiden name, Duffield), as she was lovingly known, also sculpted Butter Cows for other states such as Illinois and Utah over the years. In 2006, Duffy retired, due to health limitations, and was succeeded by her apprentice Sarah Pratt. The process through which the artists work varies according to the sculptor, but often follows the same general steps. Most start with choosing one of the six dairy cattle breeds (Holstein, Guernsey, Jersey, Brown Swiss, Ayrshire, and Milking Shorthorn) to recreate. Usually, they produce drawings of the cattle or take several photographs from which to work. As the sculpting actually begins, it is important for the butter to be of the right consistency, which has been described as feeling like cold cream. In total, about 500-600 pounds of butter is used. Over the years, sculptors moved from working in chilled rooms to large refrigerated display cases with temperatures between 35 and 40 ¬∞F. The butter is placed on a wooden-and-wire armature, at first in large amounts to achieve the general shape of the cow, and later in smaller quantities to fine-tune the form. The butter is added layer upon layer until the cow is in its finished form, taking between two days and a week, depending on the artist. Though the sculptors claim it was never a secret that the Buttercow is built on a wooden armature, many people assumed the sculpture was solid, and made entirely from butter, despite the logistical impossibilities. Linda Christensen sculpting butter at the 2010 Minnesota State Fair. The Minnesota State Fair has never had a Buttercow, but showcases butter sculpture in another way. The fair commissions carvings in butter of the twelve finalists of the Princess Kay of the Milky Way contest. These finalists are chosen from young Minnesotan women between the ages of 16 and 23 to be Dairy Princesses. Their likenesses are carved from 90 lb. blocks of butter. Each of the twelve days of the fair one finalist will be carved, currently by Linda Christensen, a California sculptor originally from Minnesota. While a princess poses on a turning platform in a chilled display case, Christensen takes about six hours to carve her likeness, all in front of fairgoers, passing by the refrigerated display area. Once the carving is complete it is displayed for the remainder of the fair, and at its closing each dairy princess may take hers home and use it as she wishes (sometimes used at graduation parties or wedding receptions).  Australia  Having seen the success of the Prince of Wales in butter in the Canadian Pavilion in the 1924 season of the British Empire Exhibition, in 1925 the Australians placed a larger butter sculpture in their pavilion at Wembley Park. It showed England cricketer Jack Hobbs being stumped at the Sydney Cricket Ground during the 1924-5 test series, which Australia had won 4-1. Canada In 1924 and 1925 the Prince of Wales featured in two butter sculptures in refrigerated cases in the Canadian Pavilion at the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley Park, Wembley, north-west London. The sculptures were both displays of patriotism and an effective advertisement for the Canadian dairy industry. In 1924 the sculpture depicted the Prince standing beside his horse outside his ranch at Pekisko, Alberta. 3,000 pounds of butter were used to produce the sculpture. The 1925 sculpture showed the Prince seated in the dress of a First Nations chief and was based on Edward‚Äôs visit to Banff in 1919, where he had been made an honorary chief by the Assiniboine. It was sculpted by George Kent and Beauchamp Hawkins. The figures of First Nations women in the 1925 butter sculpture case were the only reference to Canada's First Nations in the Canada Pavilion. It is on record that the Prince was pleased with both sculptures. When Queen Mary saw the butter sculpture of her son she laughed and said it was \\"quite a remarkable likeness.\\" The British press was impressed too, declaring the 1925 sculpture one of the wonders of Wembley. Others were equally impressed. One schoolgirl said that the prince of Wales in butter \\"was the one feature that captured everybody's imagination,\\" while a schoolboy said that his favourite exhibit at the Exhibition was the Prince of Wales in butter, and that \\"an ear‚Äôd keep us a week.\\" Some in the Canadian press were however unhappy about the 1925 sculpture, with one paper writing \\"it is time that Canada should cease to be advertised by representations of Indians in war paint.‚Äù Shortly after the end of World War II, the Ontario Cream Producers Marketing Board and the Dairy Producers of Canada began a campaign to promote their products. Butter sculpting was initiated as part of this campaign along with the slogan \\"It's better with butter\\". This was intended to increase butter's market share in competition to the high-powered advertising for margarine in the late 1940s. Butter sculptures were displayed at both the Canadian National Exhibition and Royal Agricultural Winter Fairs in Toronto. Ross Butler was the first Canadian artist to sculpt in butter at these fairs. Ross' reputation as a farm animal artist was well known by the dairy people. He created many different life size butter sculptures between 1947 and 1954. Some of the subjects included Bessie the Butter Cow with her calf Buttercup, Barbara the Milkmaid and her butter cow, Ideal Guernsey, Canadian Olympic Figure Skater Barbara Ann Scott, Laura Secord and her cow, Royal Canadian Mounted Policeman and Queen Elizabeth II on her horse Winston. Each sculpture was life sized. They were created in refrigerated, glass cased enclosures and were displayed for the duration of each fair. At the end of the events, the butter was reclaimed and put back in the trade. The last butter sculptures that Ross created were Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip at the Western Fair in London, Ontario in 1956. After that, he returned to working in clay with the familiar subjects of cattle and horses. In 1986, a fitting tribute to Ross Butler at the Royal Agricultural Winter Fair included his likeness sculpted in butter by Windsor artist, Christopher Rees. Tibet Butter sculptures in front of the assembly hall of the Kopan Monastery in the Kathmandu valley (Nepal) Butter sculpture is an ancient Tibetan Buddhist tradition; yak butter and dye are still used to create temporary symbols for the Tibetan New Year and other religious celebrations.

Douglas' film and video installations, photography and work in television frequently touch on the history of literature, cinema and music, while examining the \\"failed utopia\\" of modernism and obsolete technologies. He has exhibited internationally, including Documenta IX, 1992, Documenta X, 1997, Documenta XI, 2002 and the Venice Biennale in 1990, 2001, 2005 and 2019. Douglas was chosen to represent Canada in the 2021 Venice Biennale. Art collector Friedrich Christian Flick, in the foreword to the Stan Douglas monograph, describes Douglas as \\"a critical analysis of our social reality. Samuel Beckett and Marcel Proust, E.T.A.

Accessed September 2013. Douglas is represented by David Zwirner, New York and Victoria Miro Gallery, London. Themes =Modernism= Video still of Win, Place or Show (1998) which explores the modernist idea of urban renewal Douglas' work reflects the technical and social aspects of mass media, and since the late 1980s has been influenced by the work of Samuel Beckett.Beckett, Douglas, Ben-Zvi and Coolidge, Samuel Beckett: Teleplays, Vancouver Art Gallery, October 1 to December 3, 1988Kealy, \\"10 Texts for 18:Beckett\\", 18:Beckett, pp. 63-63 Also of concern is both modernism as a theoretical conceptKealy, \\"10 Texts for 18:Beckett\\", 18:Beckett, p. 62 and modernity as it has affected North American urbanism since World War II.Lynne Cooke, Stan Douglas and Douglas Gordon: Double Vision 2000 In using what art historian Hal Foster describes as the \\"outmoded genre\\"Foster, Design and Crime and other Diatribes, p. 137 of cinema, Douglas' interest in \\"failed utopias and obsolete technologies\\"Foster, Design and Crime and other Diatribes, p. 139 allows for the creation of a \\"new medium out of the remnants of old forms.\\" Douglas' preoccupation with failed utopias and the obsolete is not about a redemption of \\"these past events, but [a way] to reconsider them: to understand why these utopian moments did not fulfill themselves, what larger forces kept a local moment a minor moment: and what was valuable there ‚Äî what might still be useful today.\\"Watson, Thater, Douglas and Clover, Stan Douglas, p. 116 =Politics and race= Douglas' work only touches on race directly in a few instances,Milroy, \\"These artists know how to rock\\", p. R5 such as the short video I'm Not Gary (1991). This interpretation of race is important, as the brief narrative involves a white man mistaking a black man for a different black man named Gary, for writer Lisa Coulthard, this is part of a larger investigation of racism as part of imperialism and cultural invisibility. For Coulthard, the lack of mention of race in works that feature only white performers troubles any racial reading of Douglas' work. In a great deal of Douglas' works, class rather than race is the key element.Douglas and Monk, Stan Douglas, p. 31 Having grown up in a largely white middle-class neighbourhood in Vancouver, race was only an issue of invisibility rather than civil rights for Douglas.Watson, et al, Stan Douglas, p. 37 =Jazz and blues= Although race as a theme is often not a central or obvious concern of Douglas, his own identity as a Black-Canadian is often addressed through his use of music and in particular, musical idioms associated with African-American culture, such as blues and jazz.Milroy, \\"These artists know how to rock\\", p. R6 In particular, Douglas points to the cultural prejudices which associate the \\"primitive\\" with black music, while the European musical tradition is positioned as \\"high culture\\". This binary between primitive and civilized is further complicated when considering jazz and its position as both \\"race music\\" but also highly cultured and in particular the European embracing of jazz as high art.Brockington, \\"Logical Anonymity: Lorna Simpson, Steve Mcqueen, Stan Douglas\\" An early work, Deux Devises (1983), presents a projection of text, the lyrics of 19th century composer Charles Gounod's song \\"O ma belle, ma rebelle.\\" A recording of Robert Johnson's \\"Preaching Blues\\" is played, with accompanying images of Douglas phonetically mouthing the words to the song, out of sync with the recording. The pairing of the safe salon music of Gounod, and the raw sounds of Johnson, points to the typical prejudice which validates and promotes the supposed seriousness of European music. Where Johnson's words are anguished, Gounod's are safe and comfortable. Douglas' use of jazz is a more direct response to complex attitudes towards African-American music. Exhibited for the first time at documenta 9 in 1992, Hors-champs (meaning \\"off-screen\\") is a video installation that addresses the political context of free jazz in the 1960s, as an extension of black consciousnessKrajewsk, \\"Stan Douglas, 15 September 2007 ‚Äî 6 January 2008, Staatsgalerie & Wurttembergischer\\" and is one of his few works to directly address race.Milroy, \\"These artists know how to rock\\", p. R7 Four American musicians, George Lewis (trombone), Douglas Ewart (saxophone), Kent Carter (bass) and Oliver Johnson (drums) who lived in France during the free jazz period in the 1960s, improvise Albert Ayler's 1965 composition \\"Spirits Rejoice.\\".Gale, \\"Stan Douglas: Evening and others\\", p. 363 Free jazz often found a larger audience in Europe and was associated with politics and in particular in France where it was utilized by the French Communist Party during May 1968. The music is in four parts, a gospel melody, an attenuated call and response, a heraldic fanfare and \\"La Marseillaise.\\" Shot in the style of 1960s French television program and using period technology, the work is projected onto a screen, verso and recto. On one side is the \\"broadcast\\" version, a montage taken from two cameras, what would be chosen to be transmitted to the home audience. The other side shows the raw footage, the images not meant for public viewing, what was edited out. The two sides of the screen present a complete document of the performance, one in which the viewer must negotiate, depicting the \\"authorized\\" version but also the conditions of its production. What is being emphasized is a contrast between the banality of television and the radical programming that was featured at the time. Luanda-Kinshasa runs for more than six hours. Its title points directly to the origins and history of jazz in Africa.Holland Cotter (February 13, 2014), Stan Douglas: ‚ÄòLuanda-Kinshasa‚Äô New York Times. Marking the first time the artist has filmed on location in New York,Stan Douglas, Luanda-Kinshasa, January 9 ‚Äì February 22, 2014 David Zwirner Gallery, New York. however, the setting is a reimagined Manhattan milieu in the 1970s, namely the CBS 30th Street Studio. Featuring a band of professional musicians improvising together, Luanda-Kinshasa is the documentation of a fictitious recording at the famed studio. Although Douglas plants subtle period details in clothes, wall posters and cigarette brands, all attention is on the band ‚Äî which includes among its 10 instrumentalists the Senegalese drummer Abdou Mboup, the Indian tabla player Nitin Mitta, and the American drummer Kimberly Thompson ‚Äî and on the music being made. =Cinema= As a Vancouver artist getting his start in the 1980s and using lens-based media, Stan Douglas is often associated with the Vancouver School of photoconceptualism.Monk, Stan Douglas, p. 10Lee and Zimmerman, Vancouver: City Guide, p. 26 His use of video and film, in addition to photography, as well as his specific interests in cinematic history, forms and spatial concerns set him apart from peers such as Jeff Wall. Douglas has reworked films such as Alfred Hitchcock's Marnie (1964), Dario Argento's Suspiria (1977) and Orson Welles's Journey into Fear (1943) exploring \\"the parameters, functions and limits of cinematic adaptation.\\" His works reference the originals but also distance the newer works through manipulation of the texts, often employing loops and editing techniques to \\"defamiliarize\\" the originals Subject to a Film: Marnie is a re- creation of the robbery scene from Hitchcock's 1964 film. In his 1995 Art in America review Tom Eccles describes the work as \\"creating the effect of a recurring nightmare\\" as the titular character, rather than escaping is \\"caught in the film loop, forever trapped within the confines of the office.\\"Eccles, \\"Stan Douglas at David Zwirner, New York, New York\\" Douglas updates the office > with computers replacing typewriters and carpet for '50s linoleum. This > version is shot in black and white, which gives it the feel of a recollected > experience, and Douglas has slowed the action, bringing Marnie's inherent > voyeurism into focus. One can almost sense the craning neck of the > filmmaker. Marnie's well-rehearsed actions of walking to the washroom, > returning to the desk and turning the safe's combination dial are carefully > played out ‚Äì but as her gloved hand runs through the combination, the film > cuts back to the opening shot, panning out to a general view of the office > where the workers once again prepare to leave for the day. Inconsolable Memories (2005) is based on Tomas Gutierrez Alea's film Memorias del subdesarrollo (Memories of Underdevelopment) from 1968, updated to include references to the Mariel boatlift of 1980. Douglas's installation consists of a 16mm projection with a photographic series of contemporary Havana, Cuba. The film is looped and when presented as an installation the film and photographs create a sense of repetition, a common feature of Douglas' work. Rather than strictly working from Alea's film in the manner Douglas worked from Hitchcock's Marnie, Inconsolable Memories plays with the layers of its various sources (Cuba in the 1960s, the 1980s and the present). Some of the photographs reference the locations used in the original Alea film tying together the themes of history and memory. At issue is the utopian promise of the Cuban revolution and its decline, and as well, the parallel Cold War events of the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 (examined in Alea's film) and the boatlift of 1980. =Samuel Beckett= Douglas has long been interested in the work of Samuel Beckett. In 1988 he curated Samuel Beckett: Teleplays, eight Beckett works for film and television.Beckett, Douglas, Ben-Zvi and Coolidge, Samuel Beckett: Teleplays, Vancouver Art Gallery, October 1 to December 3, 1988, p. 74 In 1991, Douglas produced Monodramas a series of short videos for television broadcasting, based on his studies of Beckett's teleplays.Kernan, \\"Stan Douglas and Douglas Gordon. New York\\", p. 260 Developed for television, these 30- to 60-second video works were broadcast nightly in British Columbia in 1992 for three weeks. The short narratives \\"mimic television‚Äôs editing techniques\\" and when the videos were aired during the regular commercial breaks, viewers called the station to ask what was being sold.Media Art Net  Douglas, Stan: Monodramas . Medienkunstnetz.de. Retrieved on 2014-04-12. Douglas' first project for television, Television Spots (1987‚Äì88) consisted of twelve were broadcast in Saskatoon and Ottawa during regular programming and featured short, banal scenes in open-ended narratives.Douglas, Stan: Television Spots . Media Art Net. Retrieved on 2014-04-12. An early video work, Mime (the second part of Deux Devises, 1983) consisted of a close-up of Douglas' mouth in the shape of phonemes, which are then edited to sync up with the song \\"Preachin' Blues\\" by Robert Johnson. Douglas was not aware of Beckett's own work Not I, a disembodied mouth in a black screen. In a lecture given at YYZ Artists' Outlet in Toronto, Douglas commented that the choice of a blues song was > a fairly personal one, derived in a way from my experience of being black in > a predominantly white culture, having very little contact with black > American culture, but at the same time being expected to represent that to > people-both to people who were antagonistically racist and to liberal types. > So what you have is my image not quite synching up or relating to a very > archetypal black figure, Robert Johnson. \\"Stan Douglas YYZ Lecture January 9, 1989\\" The Independent Eye, Vol. 10 No. 2 (Winter 1989) Douglas began to study Beckett's works and his next video work Panoramic Rotunda (1985) came from misremembering a line from Beckett's FIzzle No. 7. The repetition and seemingly endless loops of the same narrative in Win, Place or Show recalls Beckett's use of repetition to point to but also undermine the \\"sameness\\" of reality. The absurdity of the forever repeating narrative, of the two protagonists in an endless loop, always the same words but from different points of reference is an allusion to Vladimir and Estragon in Waiting for Godot.Kealy, \\"10 Texts for 18:Beckett\\", pp. 63-64 Works =Early works 1983‚Äì1991= Stan Douglas' works from the 1980s are concerned with obsolete media and their aesthetics. Lost time is a continuous element in his works.Christ and Dressler Stan Douglas. Past Imperfect Works 1986‚Äì2007 The installation Overture (1986) uses footage of a train journey through the Rocky Mountains shot between 1899 and 1901. The soundtrack consists of Vancouver writer Gerald Creede reading Douglas's reworking of various sentences taken from the opening section of Marcel Proust's A la recherche de temps perdu. For writer Peter Culley, writing about two of Douglas' works in 1986, > Douglas situates Overture in the historical moment that the beginnings of > film share with the end of the novel, when Proust's faith in the tantalizing > structures of his great predecessors, Balzac and Wagner, was being > undermined by the perceptive discontinuities that film helped to bring > about.Culley, \\"Two Works by Stan Douglas\\" In Onomatopoeia (1985‚Äì1986), a screen hangs over spot-lit upright player piano. The piano plays bars from Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 32, Opus 111. Triggered by punctuations on the piano scroll, images of an empty textile factory are projected above the piano. The perforated scrolls that were used to programme weaving into fabric patterns, echo the player piano scrolls. The images are of a textile mill near the artist's home and specifically that section of the mill employing the punch cards that determine the different patterns of weave design. The punch cards are part of the same type of technology as the player piano, which to Culley \\"sets up a simultaneity of subject which the work immediately begins to subvert; image and music constantly move in and out of precise synchronization, keeping the audience at a constant level of anxious anticipation.\\" Douglas's Monodramas are ten 30- to 60-second videos from 1991, conceived as interventions into commercial television, broadcast nightly in British Columbia for three weeks in 1992. These short narratives, set in bleak suburban locations, mimic television's editing techniques, with plots dealing often mundane situations and with a slight twist at the end. The segment \\"I'm Not Gary\\" is set in a nondescript industrial strip. A white man passes a second man who is black, calling out to him \\"Gary?\\" and is visibly irritated at not being acknowledged. Finally, the second man turns to him, replying, \\"I'm not Gary.\\" For writer Lisa Coulthard, race is the interpretive framework, because for the white man in the video, \\"his interlocutor is simply a black man, interchangeable with any other for example and clearly interchangeable with Gary.\\" =Installations= A key element in a number of Douglas' installations is the use of time and in particular, an investigation into slowed-down time or stillness.Dercon, \\"Gleaning the Future from the Gallery Floor\\" His 1995 installation Der Sandmann, based on E.T.A. Hoffmann's original 1816 short story and Sigmund Freud's 1919 essay \\"The Uncanny\\", consists of a double projection where the film is literally split down the middle and reassembled so the two sides are slightly out of sync. This creates a \\"temporal gap\\", disrupting the sense of unity so crucial to modernism, so that \\"everything is deferred and delayed.\\"Birnbaum, \\"Time and Trauma\\", p. 158 Douglas' 1998 installation Win, Place or Show is shot in the style of the late-1960s CBC drama The Client, noted for its gritty style, long takes and lack of establishing shots. Set in 1950s Vancouver in the Strathcona redevelopment, the installation explores the modernist notion of urban renewal with the demolition of existing architecture in favour of grids of apartment blocks. Two men share a dormitory room on a rainy day off from their blue-collar jobs. The conversation flares up during a discussion of the day's horse races and the 6 minute filmed loop is repeated from different angles on a split screen, each cycle presenting ever-changing configurations of point-of-view. The takes are edited together in real time by a computer during the exhibition, generating an almost endless series of montages. His 2014 interactive installation, Circa 1948 was co-produced by the National Film Board of Canada, and premiered in April at the Tribeca Film Festival's Storyscapes section. Douglas also created the stage play Helen Lawrence, which shares graphics, story and characters with Circa 1948. =Photography= Abbott & Cordova, 7 August 1971 (2008) Douglas' use of photography has a different purpose than others in the Vancouver School. He works with not just photography and video, but film and television as well and his photography often addresses the history of the location of one of his installations and as well, the creation of those installations themselves. Installations such as Win, Place or Show are often complemented by large-scale photographs taken of the film set, showing behind-the-scenes.Michael Krajewski \\"Stan Douglas\\" Map Magazine Douglas' works, as installations: > ...Trouble the material and spatial boundaries of the cinema and museum (for > instance, his recent Klatsassin premiered at the 2006 Vancouver > International Film Festival and then in 2007 played at the Secession Gallery > in Vienna) and, perhaps more importantly, thematically disturb these > distinctions as his art occupies a transitional zone that interrogates > perception, narrative comprehension and modes of visual and aural > storytelling. Writer Lisa Coulthard discusses Douglas' concern for this collapsing of boundaries in the essay \\"Uncanny Memories: Stan Douglas, Subjectivity and Cinema\\" stating that \\"although predominantly approached within the purview of fine arts, Douglas's work invites interrogation from film studies insofar as it not only utilizes the medium but also actively modifies and references the canonical texts, orientations and histories of cinema.\\" Recently, Douglas has moved to photographic works which do not depict the history of the site of the narrative in an installation but rather are used as a contrast to a different work. His photographic series Every Building on 100 West Hastings from 2001 is a depiction of a stretch of a run-down section of Vancouver that is about to be gentrified.Walls, \\"Stan Douglas's performance of contested space in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside\\", p. 1 The photographs accompanied the installation Journey into Fear (also 2001), which is based on Norman Foster's 1942 war-time thriller of the same name and its remake, shot in Vancouver in 1975 and directed by Daniel Mann. Douglas compares the events of World War II with the oil crisis of 1973. In 2009 Douglas completed Abbott & Cordova, 7 August 1971, a 30 by 50 foot photographic mural depicting the Vancouver Gastown Riots of 1971, which is the central focus within the atrium of the Woodward's building redevelopment in Vancouver designed by architect Gregory Henriquez. Douglas' reading of Gilles Deleuze's essay \\"Humour, Irony and the Law\\" about the arbitrary nature of law and law enforcement influenced Douglas to reconstruct \\"forgotten incidents of social confrontation between local Vancouver police and members of the public at various times throughout the last century.\\" Abbott & Cordova, 7 August 1971 depicts an event in which the police: > ...Violently intervened in a public protest against undercover police > tactics and in favour of the legalization of marijuana. The composition was > realized using cinematic staging and digital compositing techniques to > assemble 50 different images taken with the camera in the same position. > Striving for historical accuracy, Douglas undertook extensive research, > collecting archival photographs and conducting interviews with witnesses and > participants to recreate the scene in painstaking detail. Using complex > production methods similar to those of the film industry, the details of > local businesses, commercial signage and period clothing were carefully > replicated to represent the past. The combined use of theatrical and digital > processes enabled a heightened form of realism. A focus on individuals in > the crowd reveals the reactions on their faces. Venice Biennale The National Gallery of Canada chose Douglas to represent Canada in the 2021 Venice Biennale. Douglas has exhibited at the Venice Biennale previously, most recently in 2019 where he debuted the work the two- channel video installation Doppelg√§nger (2019), \\"set in an alternate present in which a solitary astronaut and her other-world counterpart each arrives 'home' to find that everything is the reverse of what she once knew. Enacted simultaneously on two screens, the work‚Äôs structure suggested the possibility of coexisting experiences and realities.\\" The jury, including National Gallery director Sasha Suda and chief curator Kitty Scott, picked Douglas citing \\"the relevance of his work to the global debates taking place in Venice.\\" Catalogues * Douglas, Stan and Philip Monk.

From 2013 to 2018, the district was in the south-central part of the state, covering all of Adams and York counties, as well as parts of Cumberland and Dauphin counties, with representation by Republican Scott Perry. History From 2003 to 2013 the district included suburbs of Pittsburgh as well as Beaver County, Lawrence County, and Mercer County. The district had a slight Democratic registration edge, although it had voted for Republicans in several federal elections over the 2000s decade, including for President George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004, as well as Lynn Swann for governor in 2006. The heart of the district was a string of mostly white and middle class suburbs. Plum and Murrysville, two large and mainly residential boroughs, are the main towns in the suburban portion of the district that lies to the east of the city. Also included were the many suburban areas that make up northern Allegheny County and southern Butler County, Pennsylvania, including the larger communities of McCandless and Franklin Park, as well as several exclusive suburbs that have long been home to Pittsburgh's old money elite, including Fox Chapel and Sewickley. The northern suburbs had a generally moderate voting populace, which trends Democratic but makes up the swing vote, especially in races for national office. Further north, the district took on a different character. The suburban areas of Beaver County are somewhat less affluent and were heavily labor Democratic. The areas of Lawrence County and Mercer County had a more rural feel, but also had a union Democrat center within the city of New Castle. This district changed drastically when Pennsylvania's new districts went into effect on January 3, 2013. Due to slower population growth than the nation as a whole, Pennsylvania lost a seat in Congress in reapportionment following the 2010 United States Census, and this seat was effectively eliminated. Most of the 4th district was merged into a redrawn 12th district, and the previous 19th district was rebranded as the 4th. Thus from 2013 to 2018, the 4th district was located in south-central Pennsylvania and included all of Adams and York counties, as well as parts of Cumberland and Dauphin counties. During this time, the district was represented by Republican Scott Perry. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania redrew the state's congressional districts in February 2018 after ruling the previous map unconstitutional due to gerrymandering. The fourth district was reconfigured as a Democratic-leaning area to the northwest of Philadelphia for the 2018 election and representation thereafter. Geographically, it is the successor to the old 13th district, which was represented at the time by Democrat Brendan Boyle. Boyle, however, opted to run in the neighboring 2nd district, the geographic successor to the 1st district, represented by retiring incumbent Bob Brady. The bulk of Perry's representation, including York and Harrisburg, became part of a redrawn tenth district. Gettysburg and Adams County joined a new, heavily Republican 13th District, which was the successor to the old ninth district of retiring Congressman Bill Shuster. Areas to the south and east of York joined Lancaster in a redrawn, heavily Republican eleventh district, the successor of Republican Lloyd Smucker's 16th district.

It was built in 1924 and was designed by Frederick W. Cappelen. Railroad use of the bridge ended in 1981, and in 1999 the bridge was opened to bicycles and pedestrians. It replaced the former Northern Pacific \\"A Line\\" bridge.Marcia Ohlhausen, ‚ÄúNorthern Pacific Bridge Number 9,‚Äù June 24, 1994, Minnesota Architecture-History Inventory Form, available at SHPO, MHS, St. Paul, 8.2; El-Hai, Lost Minnesota, 4.F. B. Maltby, ‚ÄúThe Mississippi River Bridges,‚Äù Journal of Western Society of Engineers [July-August 1903] History The Northern Pacific Railway \\"A line\\" tracks once formed the southern boundary of the University of Minnesota East Bank campus. but as the University grew, the campus expanded southward around the railroad. The railroad noise, congestion, and pollution caused problems around the campus. In response, the Northern Pacific Railway built a new bridge that angled north of the campus, connecting with an existing Great Northern railroad line going through Dinkytown. This enabled campus expansion and allowed the Northrop Mall to be built. Today, the bridge is open to bicyclists and pedestrians. The bridge is accessible from the west side, where there is a connection to the West River Parkway trail, and on the east side via a service road up to East River Parkway near the Mineral Resources Research Center. Historic markers on either side of the bridge describe how the bridge was built and its importance to the area. The City of Minneapolis built a connection from the bridge to the U of M bicycle and pedestrian trail through Dinkytown in 2013. As part of the construction of the new St. Anthony Falls (35W) Bridge approach, a culvert was installed to allow the non-motorized trail to continue west into downtown Minneapolis; this was completed in July 2014. On the south side of the deck, the words \\"North Coast Lim\\" can be seen. It formerly read North Coast Limited to advertise the Chicago to Seattle passenger train of that name.

Its common names include Malagasy ground boa and Madagascar boa. Description This species is included in the Boidae family of snakes, subfamily Sanziniinae. No subspecies are currently recognized by ITIS. Adult females can be up to 10 feet (3.05 metres), males are typically smaller, the average size of the population is 8 feet (2.44 m) in length.Mehrtens JM. 1987. Living Snakes of the World in Color. New York: Sterling Publishers. 480 pp. . This is the largest snake species found on the island of Madagascar. Acrantophis madagascariensis, like others in the family, dispatch their prey by constriction. The color pattern consists of a pale reddish-brown ground color mixed with gray, overlaid with a pattern dorsal rhombs outlined with black or brown. Sometimes this creates a vague zigzag impression. The sides are patterned a series of black ovoid markings with reddish blotches, often bordered or centered with white. Distribution and habitat Endemic to Madagascar. Occurs in the central, northern and western parts of the island. The type locality given is \\"Madagascar.\\" thumb The species usually occurs in sparse, open woodland such as the Madagascar dry deciduous forests. Conservation status Acrantophis madagascariensis is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species since 2011. Previously it was classified as Vulnerable (VU) with the following criteria: A1cd (v2.3, 1994). This means that a population reduction of at least 20% has been observed, estimated, inferred or suspected over the last 10 years or three generations, whichever is the longer, based on a decline in area of occupancy, extent of occurrence and/or quality of habitat, and based on actual or potential levels of exploitation. The species was last assessed in 2011. It is also listed as CITES Appendix I, which identifies it as threatened with extinction and recommends a prohibition in international trade except for scientific research.Acrantophis madagascariensis at CITES and United Nations Environment Programme / World Conservation Monitoring Centre. Accessed 10 July 2008. Threats Current threats include deforestation, human population growth, agricultural and industrial development, and collection for the illegal pet trade. Behavior Shelters in mammal burrows, fallen trees, debris piles and similar sites that offer some protection. Brumation takes place during the cool and dry winter months, usually May though July. Feeding The diet consists of small mammals and birds. Reproduction Mating takes place after emerging from brumation. Females may be courted by and copulate with more than one male. Ovoviviparous, females give birth to 4-6 large young after a long gestation period of 4‚Äì6 months. Neonates are 19-24 inches (48‚Äì61 cm) in length and are already capable of feeding on small rodents and birds. References Further reading * Boulenger GA. 1893.

It forms brown to black metallic isometric crystals with a Mohs hardness of 5.5 to 6. It belongs to the spinel group of minerals, as does magnetite, Fe3O4. Ulv√∂spinel forms as solid solutions with magnetite at high temperatures and reducing conditions, and grains crystallized from some basalt-gabbro magmas are rich in the ulv√∂spinel component. The ulv√∂spinel component tends to oxidize to magnetite plus ilmenite during subsolidus cooling of the host rocks, and the ilmenite so produced may form apparent exsolution (trellis type) laminae in magnetite. The texture was once interpreted as indicating solid solution between ilmenite and magnetite, until the oxidation reaction and resultant textures were reproduced in laboratory experiments first described by Buddington and Lindsley (1964, Journal of Petrology 5, p. 310-357). The results are important to plate tectonics because magnetite is an important recorder of rock magnetism. Ulv√∂spinel was first described by Fredrik Mogensen (1904-1978) from a dolerite layered intrusion in the Ulv√∂ Islands, √Öngermanland, Sweden in 1943. The locality is an iron, titanium and vanadium mining area that has been active since the 17th century. It is common in titaniferous magnetite iron ore deposits. It also occurs in kimberlites, in some reduced iron-bearing basalts and is common in lunar basalts.

Years later, Acclaim released another game featuring Foreman, Foreman For Real. Summary George Foreman's KO Boxing was released in 1992 for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis and other 16-bit gaming consoles such as the Super Nintendo Entertainment System that features multiple heavyweight champion George Foreman. A version for the Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy was released as well. The game was also later available on the 8-bit Sega Master System and the Sega Game Gear. These two versions differ greatly from the other releases and were based on the Master System version of James Buster Douglas Knockout Boxing. In the 16-bit and Nintendo 8-bit versions, the player assumes the role of George Foreman, who, at 43 years old, is pursuing a quest to become the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world by uniting the title belts of three fictional boxing circuits. Gameplay is very similar to Punch-Out!!: players are given the option to block the opponent's attempted punches, evade in two different directions, and throwing a wide variety of punches. Victory in a match can be won by knockout, technical knockout or by decision. A knockout requires a boxer to knock his opponent down four times in a three-round match; on the fourth knockdown, the downed boxer will fail to answer the 10-count. A technical knockout is awarded if a boxer is knocked down three times in a single round. If neither of these occur by the end of the third and final round, one boxer is declared the winner by a judge's decision, which is determined by each boxer's punches thrown and landed, knockdowns and total damage done. In the 16-bit versions, a portrait of each boxer accompanies their energy meters. These portraits become progressively battered and bloody as the fighters take damage. A password system is used in career mode to save progress in the game in lieu of battery backup. Reception The game was poorly received. Mega said that \\"the dire gameplay and abysmal graphics make this a game to avoid.\\" Total! reviewer James Beaven went as so far to call it \\"worse than wrestling games,\\" panning its \\"jerky\\" animation and overwhelming difficulty: \\"the only reason this scored anything was because you can move George a bit.\\" Notes and references Category:Video games based on real people Category:Cultural depictions of boxers Category:Cultural depictions of American men Category:Boxing video games Category:Game Boy games Category:Sega Game Gear games Category:Sega Genesis games Category:Master System games Category:Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Video games set in the 1990s Category:SIMS games Category:Sega video games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Video games developed in Australia Category:Black people in art ","title":"George Foreman's KO Boxing"},{"id":"4818960","text":"Harrison Franklin Reser (January 17, 1896 ‚Äì September 27, 1965) was an American banjo player and bandleader. Born in Piqua, Ohio, Reser was best known as the leader of The Clicquot Club Eskimos. He was regarded by some as the best banjoist of the 1920s.  Early life  Reser was born in Piqua, Ohio, to William Scott Reser and Alberta Wright. The couple had another child, Ruth. Reser was a first cousin to Orville & Wilbur Wright, the Wright brothers, inventors of the airplane. When he was 2 years of age, his father moved the family to Dayton, Ohio. His musical talents became apparent, and it was also here that it was discovered that the young Reser possessed perfect pitch. His parents realized they had a child prodigy. A special guitar was made for him suited to his extremely small size, and this was his first instrument. By the age of 8 he was entertaining. Years later, he recalled, \\"Of course, being a kid, and playing for various minor concerts and recitals naturally gave me somewhat of a hero feeling, but I was never able to get the attitude of a great many people whom I often heard talking prodigies, juvenile wonders and any number of other equally mysterious things in connection with my playing. It never seemed in the least remarkable or extraordinary that I played at the age of eight.\\" About this time he began learning piano and also started a systematic study of music which was to form the basis for his natural genius and extensive knowledge of music theory. At the age of nine his parents, now realizing his potential and the benefits to be gained, sent him to Luis Hein and Albert Fischer of Dayton, where he continued study of the piano in addition to the violin and cello. He remained with the two until the age of fourteen. Reser attended Steele High School in Dayton, and it was during these years that he decided what his vocation would be. On April 8, 1916, when he was just over twenty, he married Grace Tharp of Dayton in Newport, Kentucky. Career The banjo was making its presence felt more strongly with dance bands and therefore he felt he should learn how to play it as quickly as possible. He practiced until he was able to play to a high enough standard to supplement his piano playing, thus increasing his chances of earning a reasonable living. In the summer of 1920 he played in a Dayton dance band under the leadership of Paul Goss. By this time he was playing the banjo regularly. He soon moved to Buffalo, New York to appear at the Hippodrome, playing primarily violin, though continuing to work on his banjo technique as well. After Christmas of 1920, he moved to New York City. He sought out engagements and soon found himself in demand. Some of the early bands he was involved with included those of Ben Selvin, Benny Krueger, Sam Lanin, Nathan Glantz, and Mike Markel (for whom he played saxophone). By 1922, he had recorded a half dozen pieces, including \\"Crazy Jo\\" and Zez Confrey's \\"Kitten on the Keys\\". In early autumn of the same year, he considered starting his own band. Soon a contract was drawn up with Okeh Records and his first band, the Okeh Syncopators, came into being during September or October 1922. Shortly after the start of this new endeavor he was approached by Paul Whiteman to sit in for Whiteman's regular banjoist, Mike Pingitore, during a UK tour of the Paul Whiteman Orchestra. Reser had three original compositions written for tenor banjo; The Cat and the Dog, Cracker Jack, and Lolly Pops. In 1925, he found fame as the director for NBC's Clicquot Club Eskimo Orchestra, continuing with that weekly half-hour until 1935. At the same time, he also led other bands using pseudonyms. \\"Harry Reser and His Six Jumping Jacks\\", with vocals by Tom Stacks, were the zany forerunners to comedy bands like Spike Jones and His City Slickers. Reser and his band were the first to record \\"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town\\" in 1934. In December 1934, he and the orchestra began a weekly broadcast on NBC radio, with Peg LaCentra and Ray Heatherton as vocalists. Throughout his career he was an endorsed artist, playing instruments from several well-known makers. During the 1920s he mainly played a variety of William L. Lange's Paramount tenor and plectrum banjos, and Lange presented him with a Super Paramount Artists Supreme, as he also did to Mike Pingitore, another Paramount musician. Later Reser would play Gibson and Vegavox banjos. Harry Reser played \\"Tiger Rag\\" and \\"You Hit the Spot\\" in the Vitaphone musical short Harry Reser and His Eskimos (1936). Reser remained active in music for the rest of his life, leading TV studio orchestras and playing with Broadway theatre orchestras. In 1960 he appeared with Bing Crosby, Peggy Lee, and Buster Keaton in \\"A 70th Birthday Salute to Paul Whiteman\\" on TV's The Revlon Revue. He wrote several instructional books for the banjo, guitar, and ukulele. In 1965, Reser died of a heart attack in the orchestra pit of Manhattan's Imperial Theatre while warming up for a Broadway stage version of Fiddler on the Roof. He was inducted into the National Four- String Banjo Hall of Fame, a museum in Oklahoma, in 1999. Reser revivals In 2002, banjoist Michael Mason portrayed Harry Reser in Heartland Chautauqua, a tent-show recreation of a 1920s traveling Chautauqua show at Nifong Park in Missouri. Guitarist Howard Alden switched to a banjo to recreate the sound of Harry Reser for his album Howard Alden Plays the Music of Harry Reser (Stomp Off, 1988). Alden recorded 15 compositions written by Reser during the years 1922 to 1935.

After his defeat, his mind fused with Kyoshiro and his body was hidden away somewhere in the forest of Aokigahara. He is very sadistic and enjoys slaughtering anyone. Over time, his bloodlust slowly decreases though he still kills without mercy. It continues to surface at times, though training with Muramasa helps fully calm him. It is during this period he first meets Yuya, he finds himself very protective over her though handling it in a very childish manner, such as calling her \\"Dog face\\" and \\" Ugly\\". Though it is stated by Kyoshiro in the manga that he indeed likes Yuya, and shown in the anime to the extent where he saves her life whenever she is endangered, he doesn't like to admit the fact that he cares about her. In the anime, it is shown that he indeed likes Sakuya, but the manga didn't directly say that they are lovers once. Later on, Kyo is shown to lose a bit of control when Yuya was on the verge of death, due to the water dragon egg that Shinrei planted inside her heart (she only had 60 days to live until the dragon eats its way out of her heart, unless Kyo comes to find him in the Mibu Clan Territory). Also, he was enraged when Kyoshiro, in Kyo's original body (both men have swapped bodies at that time), took the dying Yuya away from him after he had defeated Nobunaga's spirit that was possessing Nozomu's body. While Yuya is injured by Nobunaga, Kyoshiro comes and saves Yuya by taking her away. This illustrates that Kyoshiro is very tender towards Yuya and likes her a bit since she is so bubbly. At this point, Kyo is in enraged and proclaimed \\"Give me my body and my woman back\\". Therefore, it is implied that Kyo and Yuya have feelings for each other and the manga gives more depth into their relationship. The anime also indirectly shows the affection that he has for her, such as letting Yuya hit him when no one else dares to since he is the thousand man slayer. In the manga, Yuya slaps him couple times, and he doesn't do anything. When he is with Yuya he lets his guard down. In the manga, Kyo is a pervert and his number 1 target is Yuya, whose breasts he loves to molest. It is extremely strange that he prefers Yuya over Okuni when Okuni is always right there for him. For once, Demon Eyes Kyo the thousand man slayer learns how to love and care for someone and change not just his bloodthirst, but also his life. This point is always stated by other characters that Yuya is his weakness and that is why Akira and Shinrei use her as a hostage to aggravate Kyo. Kyo's weapon is Tenro, one of the \\"Four Great Demon Blades.\\" It was forged by Muramasa, and it is nearly unbreakable. His sword style is , which was taught to him by Muramasa. It teaches standard fencing skills and defense, but they are far more powerful than any of the skills of other sword styles. It is the most powerful sword school in the Mibu Clan. It utilizes attacks that can cut air and create illusions. He later learns a higher form of the style that utilizes the Four Symbols (Genbu, Seiryuu, Byakko, Suzaku and even Kouryuu), manifesting a number of different powers based upon the creatures. Kyo is the last remaining True Mibu and has the True Red eyes, which allows him to turn into a Battle God or Demon God. After he turns into the Battle God and suppresses his battle lust, he is granted the mark, and thus the title of the Aka no Ou. Kyo was born in the Mibu village and was friends with the former Aka no Ou. Once the Aka no Ou turned evil, Muramasa took Kyo from the village so that he may grow up to be the 'hope' of the Mibu clan. Kyo travelled the world and formed the Shiseiten in order to become strong enough to return to the Mibu village and defeat the former Aka no Ou. By the end of the series, he is acknowledged as the strongest fighter in the series. In the bonus chapter of the manga Yuya and Kyo live together. =Mibu Kyoshiro= ; (English anime: Kyoshiro Mibu,Home page. Samurai Deeper Kyo website. Retrieved on September 7, 2009. ) is a fictional character in the manga Samurai Deeper Kyo by Akimine Kamijyo. His personality is almost a direct opposite of the series' main character, Demon Eyes Kyo. Mibu Kyoshiro has been ranked top 10 in every Samurai Deeper Kyo popularity contest. His personality and character can also be compared to Himura Kenshin from Rurouni Kenshin, since they both dislike violence, but will fight in order to protect their friends and are far more dangerous than they appear, though unlike Kenshin, Kyoshiro temporarily gives in to the darkness inside him. Awkward and funny at the beginning of the adventure, Mibu Kyoshiro is, in fact, a frightening combatant called \\"the Demon-God\\" who is the only one to have beaten Kyo. In the manga, Kyoshiro has the ability to transfer human souls. He uses this to transfer Kyo's soul into his own body while hiding Kyo's body. He killed many people in the past, including the adoptive brother of Shiina Yuya and genetical brother of his love interest Sakuya, Shiina Nozomu. He is actually a high ranked Mibu and is gifted in the handling of a sword and is thought to be the best swordsman of the clan to date. He knows the techniques of the Mumyou Jinpu Ryuu and is also the former owner of the Shibien. As far as areas of comparison go, his skill and potential rank him equal to Kyo and just below the former Crimson King. His only wish is to protect Sakuya, whom he is in love with, and implied in the anime, along with Kyo before the battle of Sekigahara. It is seen in the manga that he had always been in love with Sakuya and Kyo is a dear, close friend who cares for them both. In both the anime and manga, he cares greatly for Yuya and would do anything to protect her, saying he will not let Kyo have her. Also, it is noted by Sasuke how Kyoshiro looks at Yuya tenderly as seen in Chapter 234 (Volume 29). Mibu Kyoshiro is one of the Red Cross Knights, created from the flesh and blood of the former Aka no Ou. He was a killing machine, but he had a very friendly heart, in the anime. In the manga, he only became friendly with Sakuya's influence. He was also a master of Mumyo Jinpu Ryuu Satsujin Ken. He once wielded the Shibien, one of Muramasa's Devil Swords, and killed many people with it until the sword turned black in color because it absorbed too much blood. In the end of the manga, it is shown that Kyoshiro is living with Sakuya and visits Yuya and Kyo. =Shiina Yuya= '; (English anime: Yuya Shiina, ) is a bounty hunter interested in the largest bounty she can find, that of 1,000,000 ryo that is on the head of Demon Eyes Kyo. She decides to follow Kyoshiro, bonding with him until he is \\"put to sleep\\" by the reappearance of Kyo. When Kyo wakes up completely, she follows him. In spite of his attitude, she comes to trust and believe in Kyo. In the forest of Aokigahara, she learns that Kyoshiro killed her older brother and decides to wait until he returns to the surface in order to get an explanation from him. Yuya is thus interested in Kyo and Kyoshiro. Somewhere deep in her heart, she knows the valuable secret of the Mibu Clan, a secret that her brother Nozomu shared with her when she was very young. The Aka no Ou also comes to believe that she is a seer, but this is neither confirmed nor disproven. In Chapter 229 (Volume 29) of the manga, while telling her brother that she would not forgive him if he killed Kyo, she admitted out loud in front of everybody that she was in love with Kyo. Despite being very temperamental and even violent if irritated, Yuya has a gentle and kind personality. Besides Kyo, Benitora and Akira have a crush on her. Many other characters come to enjoy her company and regard her as an important friend whom they will protect. At the very end of the manga, Yuya is searching for Kyo and in the bonus chapter Kyo and Yuya live together. At the end of the anime, Yuya is shown to make a decision about choosing Kyo or Kyoshiro, but it is not fully explained who she chooses. =Izumo no Okuni= ' () is the best informer in Japan. She adores Kyo obsessively, to the point that to be hated by him would make her happy. That said, she joined the J≈´nishinsh≈ç as Indara II, but she does not hesitate to sacrifice herself for Kyo. She then joins Kyo's team and assists Kyo in finding his real body. She knows many things about Kyo, Kyoshiro, and Sakuya, but she does not speak about them, merely hints at them. When the group separated she went to Kyoto. She finds Akira in Kyoto and offers him her own life in exchange for Kyo's real body; however, Akira doesn't kill her, instead sending Okuni to infiltrate the Mibu land to find information. Akira promises he will guard Kyo during that time. In the Mibu arc she appeared shortly when she successfully infiltrated Mibu land. She was caught by Taihaku and engaged him in a short battle, during which she revealed her weapon, \\"Tekogen\\" (iron string). She was not victorious as, at a point in the battle, Taihaku told her to stop fighting. Taihaku then allowed her to escape. She then rejoins with the group, her body wounded, stating that Kyo's body is on Taishiro's hand. When the group split into four she advanced with Sasuke to fight against the J≈´nishinsh≈ç. She witnessed Sasuke fight his old friend, Makora (Kotaro), and the real Indara. After Makora brutal death by Indara, she cried and said that Makora once said to her that the creatures that Mibu Clan creates are like fireworks: even though they live a short life they fight hard as long as they can so that they can shine brightly. After the fight she once again left Sasuke to continue gathering information. During Mibu arc, Okuni is mostly unseen as she's mainly focusing on gathering information to help defeating Crimson King. In the bonus chapter it is shown that Yuya has a love potion which given to her by Okuni that Bontenmaru trying to steal. =Benitora= The true identity of '; () is . His father, Tokugawa Ieyasu, ordered him to spy on Kyo, but Benitora does this for fun and serves as the comic relief of the group. His weapon is the Hokuraku Shimon (Demon Spear) created by Muramasa. He falls in love with Yuya the first time he meets her and tends to be over-protective of her. In order to hide his true identity as heir to the Shogunate from her, he speaks with a noticeable Kansai accent (or in the English dub of the anime, a southern accent) when near her. He first meets Kyoshiro in volume 2, mistaking him for Kyo. After sparring with Kyoshiro, he decides to join the group. When Kyo awakens in volume 3, he makes Benitora his #2 servant after a short fight. During the Forest Arc, he fights a former fellow disciple of his master, Mekira II. Mekira has the upper hand for most of the fight thanks to a hypnotic technique, but Benitora eventually sees through it and kills Mekira with a special technique of his own, although doing so exacerbates his injuries. When Nobunaga reappears and overwhelms Kyo, Benitora intervenes, blocking the killing blow and briefly fighting Nobunaga one-on-one. He is completely outmatched, but eventually manages to unhorse Nobunaga with another secret technique, the reverse Hassun, almost killing himself in the process; he is saved from death at Nobunaga's hands by the revitalized Kyo. He had a great part in Mibu arc, he fought Taihaku, the leader of Goyosei and won. He also fight against Crimson Tower army while his friend Akira battled with Tokito. In the last battle he and Sasuke successfully retrieved the Crimson King heart. In the bonus chapter he continued study to lead Japan in future with Mahiro in his side. It is earlier implied in his fight against the real Kubira that it's Mahiro, not Yuya, that he really has feelings for. =Sanada Yukimura= '; (English anime: Yukimura Sanada', ) is a famous general who lost the battle of Sekigahara and ultimately Japan. He escaped Kudoyama and planned the assassination of Tokugawa Ieyasu, though it was never carried out. Yukimura travels with Kyo in order to defeat the Mibu Clan and Oda Nobunaga. In doing so, this would free Japan from the Mibu Clan's shadow governing and give Yukimura a chance at taking over Japan. Yukimura is shadowed by a team of elite ninja called the Sanada J≈´y≈´shi: Sarutobi Sasuke, Saizo, and his kagemusha Anayama Kosuke. His sword techniques are unnamed, but he uses the Sekireigan, which was taught to him by Anri. Yukimura can utilize the Sekireigan to access extreme speed, but Anri instructed him to never use it more than five times a day. When he was young, his childhood girlfriend was killed in a massacre that could have been avoided, but was not for strategic reasons. He seems to have greatly admired the Toyotomi clan's founder, Hideyoshi, when he talked about his past, and the reason to his other given name '. In volume 26, he fights and defeats Shindara. He also fights Kyo to a draw in volume 27, both of them using their most powerful techniques, however Kyo is not in his true body, nor has he awakened his true red eyes. Yukimura shows big progress throughout the story, but most of it occurs off the page, with Yukimura simply leaving the main party and returning a stronger warrior. He trains with Anri, one of Muramasa's guards, who teaches him the Sekireigan (Eye of the Sekirei). With this he is able to move extremely fast and attack from many angles simultaneously. He later faces both Chinmei and the Former Crimson King himself, though he loses to the King, he is able to defeat Chinmei with the help of Sasuke and the Jyuyushi. Although he is not on Kyo nor Kyoshiro's level at the end, he is clearly as strong as the Four Emperors. Yukimura is renowned for his casual, cheerful demeanour; he is almost always seen with a smile and often seems very preoccupied with seducing beautiful women and drinking sake. He is thirty- seven years old, and attributes his youthful appearance to good skin care. Despite this, he can be terrifying when he is enraged. He is also notable for his treatment of his ninja followers, whom he cares about and respects deeply as members of his family. As a result, the J≈´y≈´shi are not only loyal to him, but care about him personally. Yukimura hates Ieyasu more than anything. Historically, Yukimura had already fought Ieyasu's son, Hidetada (Benitora), at the battle of Ueda Castle. This is briefly mentioned in the anime and possibly the manga. It is a battle which is believed to have ended in Yukimura's loss. =Sarutobi Sasuke= '; () is a young ninja who is one of three members of the Sanada J≈´y≈´shi who appears prominently throughout Samurai Deeper Kyo. He is only 12 years old, but even though he is young, he is very great at handling a sword. Originally, he lived in Aokigahara (a forest filled with the failed constructs of the Mibu) with his friend Kotarou (now Makora of the J≈´nishinsh≈ç). Being of the Forest, he has heightened strength and abilities as well as characteristic golden eyes. Sasuke was involved in most of Yukimura's plots, but was ultimately left out of Yukimura's deception of the Mibu clan as Yukimura needed even Sasuke to believe he'd betrayed his friends in order for the Mibu to believe it as well. Sasuke originally wielded a Muramasa blade which was physically identical to Kyo's Tenrou (one of the four masterpieces that Muramasa forged), but when that Muramasa was cracked in a duel with Demon Eyes Kyo (a fight to determine who had the real Tenrou) he was given the Shibien - the oldest of Muramasa's Four Masterpieces. The Shibien blade, however, is exceptionally bloodthirsty and its creator, Muramasa, had to have it bound in chains to prevent it from turning on anyone. Strangely enough, it serves Sasuke obediently. Sasuke seems to have control over Lightning techniques. Sasuke possesses a technique called Raikoken that electrifies his sword. Thunder Fire calls a bolt of lightning down to strike an enemy. Thunder Flower Storm brings many lightning bolts down around Sasuke and his enemy. Thunder Net or Lightning's web traps Sasuke's enemies in a web of lightning which never lets go. Thunder Tail connects Sasuke's lightning to his sword allowing him to kill an enemy with a physical strike. Sasuke's ultimate technique is Kirin which creates a lightning winged Pegasus that burns all it touches when it returns to heaven. Also, it was seen in one of Sasuke's battles that he has the same red eyes as Kyo. Shiseiten (The Four Emperors) The ' is a group of the four most powerful samurai: Akira, Bontenmaru, Hotaru, and Akari. These four \\"emperors\\" were united and led by Kyo. They fought in the most remarkable civil war of Japan, called \\"The Battle of Sekigahara\\". To the Shiseiten, the world was their playground; they defeated every nation in Japan. This ended abruptly when Kyo suddenly decided to abandon the Shiseiten to become the strongest samurai. The Shiseiten split up with everyone following their own path. Four years later, in the story of Samurai Deeper Kyo, the Shiseiten have reunited in order to challenge the Mibu Clan. In the anime series, the Shiseiten do not exist as a group, and only Akira and Hotaru appear. =Akira= ' () is the first member of the Shiseiten to appear in the story. He was a peasant boy whom Kyo found in a village that he'd completely destroyed. Though Akira was very young and the only survivor, he refused to cry and instead faced Kyo with the intention of fighting him. Kyo was impressed with Akira's fighting spirit and adopted him, promising to make him the strongest man in the world - after Kyo, of course. He was nicknamed the Twin Headed Dragon for two reasons: one, because his techniques require two swords, called Chisakatana (Â∞è„ÅïÂàÄ, lit. Small sword, one shorter than the second as noted by Saishi), and two, because of his two personalities. One moment he is docile, kind, and gentle, and in a flash, he is a blood-thirsty killer akin to Kyo himself. Akira was incapable of unlocking his full potential because he didn't have samurai/noble blood, but he overcame this limitation by intentionally blinding himself. He gained the , making him even more perceptive than those who can see. In a ruse to gain Kyo's body, Akira temporarily joined Nobunaga's warriors by killing Ajira, the servant of Nobunaga. Because of this, Akira was allowed to adopt Ajira's name. After Akira betrayed Nobunaga, he joined Kyo again after Okuni gave him her hair. His signature move is the Muhyo Getten, which traps his enemies in a pillar of ice and shatters them. Another attack he uses is the Hyoken Seiso. This technique traps his enemies in a large hollow mountain of ice. While issuing this attack, Akira is invulnerable to attacks and can torture his enemies until they die, or he can kill them in an instant. His ultimate attack involves the Inferno's Chill and Hyoma Juji Soumai. The Inferno's Chill drops the temperature to below Absolute Zero. Akira can then focus the Inferno's Chill into his swords and direct an attack, the Hyoma Juji Soumai, at his enemies, killing them instantly. During his fight against Tokito, he was able to surpass his limited power by using his Inferno's Chill on himself, making him more powerful, and use a new technique called \\"Shadow Ice of Maria\\". (This power was limited and caused Akira's body damage.) Akira's story in the anime is very different from in the manga, where he kidnaps Kyo's body and then has an unexpected change of heart about his former compatriot. He is attacked and left to burn in Kyoto's ruins by Hotaru, and is heavily implied to have died. He then appears at the Mibu castle freezing Nobunaga to buy a few moments for Kyo and the others. In the end, it is shown that he and Hotaru are friends again heading off to train together. =Bontenmaru= ' () is the second member of the Shiseiten to appear in the story. Arrogant and in love with his own legend, he constantly reminds everyone that he will become the ruler of the world and that both Tokugawa Ieyasu and the Mibu Clan are going to be destroyed so that he can become Shogun, much to the ire and boredom of his traveling comrades. Nonetheless, he is a great friend as well as a fearsome foe. Bontenmaru suppresses a beast inside of him, and that's what most terrifying about him. His real name is ', the \\"Oda Nobunaga of the north\\". His weapon of choice is a Bokken. He is so skilled with it that he is able to use it against a real sword, instinctively turning it at the last second so that it absorbs the blow of a sword but doesn't break. He is also capable of killing an enemy rather easily with a wooden sword. He can unleash the beast within himself using his Satsujintai fighting technique, in which he can enter a berserker rage and tear foes apart with his bare hands. He uses his great strength as a weapon in battle. He can effortlessly defeat small groups of Mibu warriors without getting hurt. His muscles are strong enough to stop blades from piercing his skin. He has a friendly rivalry with Kyo, and much of their time is spent glaring at each other and trying to establish dominance. His Satsujintai is a hand-to-hand fighting technique, and his most powerful technique is the Kosoga. He swings one fist upwards in an uppercut motion and another downwards to form a vertical pincer, which can be used to break bones or, at a later stage, create a massive crater. (This technique can also be used horizontally.) =Hotaru= ' () - Hotaru (whose original name was Keikoku) was a member of the five stars of the Mibu and was sent to spy on Kyo. He has great admiration for the blood-thirsty and icy Kyo and resents Kyo's softer side that has developed by coming into contact with Yuya. He also resents his older half-brother Shinrei (another member of the five stars) because Shinrei is the valued \\"wanted son\\" while he, Hotaru, is the illegitimate son of a concubine. Despite Shinrei's ignorance of the truth, Hotaru's entire life seems centred around his animosity towards his brother. All he does is counter Shinrei. Where Shinrei uses water (their father being a Master of the Muryou Saikyou Ryuu School, the water school of the Mibu), Hotaru devotes himself to fire. Where Shinrei swore to uphold the honor and wishes of the Mibu Clan, Hotaru rebelled. Where Shinrei sought strength through friendship and camaraderie, Hotaru sought strength through solitude. This prompts him to battle his former allies, the Shiseiten and Kyo, because he believes that they stand between himself and the solitude needed for true strength. Hotaru is defeated by Kyo and becomes his \\"servant\\" as his life was spared by him. He stays behind in order to recover from his injuries but reaches Kyo and his friends when Kyo is about to be defeated by Shinrei. Hotaru battles his half-brother and, much to his surprise, discovers that Shinrei already knew they were related. Moreover, Shinrei was the one who convinced their father to stop sending assassins after Hotaru and even managed to get Hotaru accepted as one of the five stars of the Mibu, mainly because Shinrei wanted to face Hotaru as an equal since Hotaru was his only brother. Hotaru is defeated by his brother, who merely puts him unconscious while pretending to have killed him. When Shinrei is about to be killed by Kyo, Hotaru protects him and pleads to Kyo to spare him. Hotaru later rejoins the Shiseiten to battle his teacher, Yuan, and the rest of his former clan. Hotaru's command of fire allows him to summon black flame, which is hotter than any normal flame, and to generate a solid shield of flame to protect himself. He reveals many techniques, among which include: Chikewai (Hotaru applies blood on his face, increasing his power), Shakuran Entai (a blast of fire that covers a large area), Kaho (traps a foe in a shell with flames burning inside; when the foe attempts to break out, it causes a massive backdraft), Mao En (summons a bigger and hotter flame than Shakuran Entai), Demon's Breath (summons black fire and shoots it at his enemies), and the Hell Crusher (surrounds himself with a massive field of black flame leaving a huge crater). In the battle against his master, Yuan, he reveals his ultimate technique, Keikoku kien [Hotaru creates a maelstrom of fire which surrounds his opponent and pastes Chikewai on his opponent which burns them to death (this technique can also apply Chikewai on his partner to increase their skills)]. He fights with a double-sided sword: one side shaped like a katana, the other shaped similar to a long dagger. It is believed this sword is just one long blade with wraps and a hand guard so he can hold it. Hotaru is the comic relief of the group. He acts extremely stupid and dense and always states the obvious. Some examples of this are Hotaru's fight with Kyo (he makes a long speech then forgets what it was supposed to be about), when he leads Kyo's group through the Mibu palace (When asked directions, he says they should go straight when the path ahead of them is a straight one), his battle with Yuan (When Yuan said he can beat Hotaru with only his foot, Hotaru said he will beat Yuan with only his finger), and various others. Hotaru's right eye becomes red whenever his subconscious is awakened. Hotaru, after realizing that he was not alone in the world, became deeply concerned with protecting and saving the ones he cares about although he doesn't show it directly. He calls Kyo \\"a friend of combat\\" and tries his hardest to protect him. He also becomes friends with Benitora, Sasuke, Yuya, and Yukimura. He is considered a family member by Yuan's family. Also, his relationship with Shinrei becomes much more close. Although they both claim to still hate each other, their fights and teasing are much more similar to sibling rivalry. Throughout the manga, Hotaru keeps saying that he hates water and continuously teases his older brother; however, he has shown that he deeply cares about him and will save and help him whenever he can. =Akari= '; () is a transgender (biological man). His birth name is Mitarai Toukichirou. Although he is thought less skilled at fighting than the other Emperors when he first appears, his magical abilities are on par with the other Shiseiten and he is later revealed to be a superb swordsman. He can manipulate ki, enabling quick healing and unlimited fighting energy, although he cannot use his abilities on himself. He also wields the Devil Eye, an ancient weapon embedded in his gloved left hand, that turns everyone who makes eye contact with it into dust, though Akari hates using it because he feels it is only a tool for murder and has no place in honorable battles. The Devil Eye also serves as a barrier by protecting its bearer from harmful spells. In the fight against Mekira I, the berserker used his Medusa Eyes (a lesser version of the Devil Eye that turns its victims to stone) on Akari, only to fail. Akari then used the Devil Eye on Mekira which turned him to dust. He is often used as comic relief. He uses a shakujou, a staff with bells and rings at the top. Once, He made Kyo promise to marry him if he ever landed a hit on him, but he is unsuccessful in the series. He first appeared in volume 22 of the manga. In that volume, He also revealed his past, where he was raised as a female even though he was born male since traits like him were often stronger in women. Often he was treated as a demon due to his powers, or people simply got close to him just to use his powers. He was the last to join the Shiseiten. It is revealed later that Hishigi implanted the Devil Eye into Akari's hand as a way of spying on him and to awaken his true powers. When activated, the Devil Eye takes over Akari and transforms him into Ashura. Kyo kills the Devil Eye by showing it a reflection of itself, from which point on Akari is free of its control. Oda Nobunaga '; (), known as Dai Rokuten Maou (The sixth Heavenly Demon king, \\"His Majesty\\" in the dub), wants to take over the world. With the help of his J≈´nishinsh≈ç, he was working to achieve that goal, but he was killed by child Kyo at Honnoji Temple, years before the Battle of Sekigahara. Since he was important to the Mibu's plans, the Mibu Clan resurrected him in Lord Torii's (Benitora's uncle) body. Lord Torii's body was given to the Mibu by Kyoshiro who then implanted Oda Nobunaga's soul into the body. Kyo defeated Nobunaga at the Battle of Sekigahara. Nobunaga was again resurrected and later encountered Kyo in Aokigahara Forest. Kyo and Oda Nobunaga fought after Benitora knocked him off of his horse. The fight resulted in the death of Oda Nobunaga, in the anime. In the manga, Yukimura requests that Kyo let the wounded Oda Nobunaga go. Kyo kills him in their next battle. Shindara takes Nobunaga's head to the Mibu, who then resurrect him, this time in Shiina Nozomu's body, so Nozomu's memories can be accessed by Nobunaga who will also be able to use Nozumi's powers. Nobunaga fights Kyo for the fourth time; during which Oda revives the members of the J≈´nishinsh≈ç defeated so far, using Nozumi's shaman powers. He is once again defeated, only to reveal that he was just like the rest of the group (via Sasuke's remark); a man looking to be the strongest, to have no fear, and create his own path in the world. A world supposedly of 'peace' (a world under his control). The manga leans towards explaining Nobunaga's attraction to Kyo (his fearless eyes) and how Kyo seemed to be the reason Nobunaga felt moved by humanity, and strived to be the strongest. He tells Kyo that he will return again, because that has been him will all along, to defeat Kyo. Kyo accepts this challenge. The encounter with Shiina Nozomu and the background story of Nobunaga does not occur in the anime. Instead, Nobunaga's sister takes the place of Nozomu, as Shatora, the leader of the J≈´nishinsh≈ç. She resurrects her brother from Lord Torii to a tree then into Kyo's body. Nobunaga has a simple character role of someone who has gone insane and only wants to take over the world. J≈´nishinsh≈ç (The Twelve Gods) The ' are the twelve warriors (exactly sixteen with the four demons) who swore to protect Oda Nobunaga at all costs. These twelve warriors are also connected to the twelve constellations of the zodiac. The four that appear in the Aokigahara Arc (Mekira, Kubira, Haira, and Indara) are substitutes for the real corresponding J≈´nishinsh≈ç, as they were imprisoned for their insatiable bloodlust at the time. In the Four Demons Arc, the aforementioned J≈´nishinsh≈ç then appear as the antagonists. =Ajira= ::Based on Anila of the Twelve Heavenly Generals serving Bhaisajyaguru Ajira (È†ûÂÑûÁæÖ), whose identity remains unknown to the end of the series, was killed by Akira who took his name in order to get closer to Demon Eyes Kyo. =Antera= ::Based on Andira of the Twelve Heavenly Generals serving Bhaisajyaguru Antera (ÂÆâÂ∫ïÁæÖ) is one of the Juunishinshou. Despite her youth, she has superhuman strength and wields a pair of large hammers. She is a member of the Mibu Clan, and as such, has the Death Disease though her aging process has been stopped in order to stop the disease which has no cure. She is the daughter of Kubira I and her real name is Anju. During the battle against Akira, she injected herself with a stimulant and turned back into her true form, an adult named Anju, but as soon as she transformed, the Death Disease reappeared and she immediately started dying. When Akari removed the stimulant from her body turning her back into a kid, Antera lost all her memories and became a normal child. =Basara= ::Based on Vajra of the Twelve Heavenly Generals serving Bhaisajyaguru Basara (‰ºêÊäòÁæÖ) is one of the J≈´nishinsh≈ç who specializes in archery. He can fire more arrows than usual (5 or so), all with accurate aiming. While doing this, his front is exposed. To overcome this, he prepares arrow traps that surround him, so an opponent cannot get close to him. In his ultimate attack, he fires his entire quiver with one shot (about 50 arrows). He was defeated by Sanada Yukimura, who sliced him in half. His real name was Maro and he spoke in third person, causing confusion as to his name. He is based on the famous page Mori Ranmaru, who died trying to protect Nobunaga at the Honn≈ç-ji incident. =Bikara= ::Based on Vikarala of the Twelve Heavenly Generals serving Bhaisajyaguru Bikara (ÊØòÁæØÁæÖ), another member of the J≈´nishinsh≈ç. He specializes in power and speed. Four years before the start of Samurai Deeper Kyo, Bikara fought Kyo in Sekigahara. The battle ended in a draw. In Aokigahara, Kyo fought Bikara again, nearly killing him. When he, Akira, Antera, and Shindara reached the ice fortress where Kyo's true body was hidden, Akira killed Bikara and took Kyo's body. Bikara is a hand-to-hand specialist and surprises his enemies with his speed. He uses numerous metal disks as weapons. Despite his massive size and extremely macho appearance, Bikara is extremely effeminate and very girlish and seems to be jealous of actual women. He is also gay, since he proclaims himself to be in love with the sleeping Kyo and implies that he finds Sasuke attractive too. =Haira (fake)= ::Based on Pajra of the Twelve Heavenly Generals serving Bhaisajyaguru Fake Haira: Similar to both the fake Mekira and the real Indara, he was cruel, which was evident when he killed one of his soldiers for running away from Yukimura after being given the option to flee. This angered Yukimura, which led to the fake Haira's death. Yukimura cut him in half vertically. Haira wielded five swords like boomerangs. Aside from his superhuman strength, he had no special ability, although he did seem to self-cauterize a severed arm during battle. In the English dub he is said to be a living relative of Oda Nobunaga and of Noble blood. =Indara (fake)= ::Based on Indra of the Twelve Heavenly Generals serving Bhaisajyaguru Fake Indara: Izumo no Okuni. Nobunaga, through Basara, commanded her to gain information on his enemy. She wielded Taigen (spider strings) and had no special ability. =Kubira (fake)= ::Based on Khumbhira of the Twelve Heavenly Generals serving Bhaisajyaguru Fake Kubira: A member of the J≈´nishinsh≈ç. He can create marionettes, which copy the abilities of the person who has been replicated, or replicas of himself. He wields a \\"cat-o- nine-tails\\", a nine tailed whip complete with needles in the rope side. He was defeated by Kyo and Kyoshiro and killed by Akira. =Makora= ::Based on Mahoraga of the Twelve Heavenly Generals serving Bhaisajyaguru Makora (Êë©ËôéÁæÖ), whose real name was ', the childhood friend of Sasuke. Makora () sought revenge against Sasuke because he was almost killed by Sasuke. In truth, however, Kotarou was temporarily controlled by the real Indara who caused him to attack Sasuke. Sasuke was simply defending himself, but all Kotarou could remember was Sasuke attacking him. Makora has the ability to control shadow forces and hide under them. His attack, Kageochi, makes an opponent drown in his own shadow. Nevertheless, he was finally defeated by Sasuke after realizing that Sasuke did not want to kill him. They made a pact of becoming good friends when they were still living in Aokigahara. Once he learned the truth, Kotarou protected Sasuke from Indara's attack which ultimately killed him. In the anime, Makora lives and joins Sanada Yukimura and Sasuke's forces in their fight against Benitora and his forces. =Mekira (fake)= ::Based on Mihira of the Twelve Heavenly Generals serving Bhaisajyaguru Fake Mekira: Learned the ways of Shikage Ryuu alongside Benitora sometime in the past. Mekira killed his master because he would not teach Mekira the school secrets. Once he became J≈´nishinsh≈ç, he faced Benitora in Aokigahara and was killed after Benitora realized the power of the Shinkage, ripping out half of Mekira's stomach. He wielded a large scythe. =Santera= ::Based on Sandilya of the Twelve Heavenly Generals serving Bhaisajyaguru Even though she is just a child, Santera (ÁèäÂ∫ïÁæÖ) has a powerful ability. She emits a powder that melts whoever comes into contact with it. Her true form was released by a Mibu serum in the battle with Akari: a beautiful butterfly woman who was able to burn anything in her path. Because of her powder, she could not have a relationship with anyone in her life, so Nobunaga adopted her as one of his J≈´nishinsh≈ç. After she had a fight with Akari, she and Akari became firm friends. She left the Mibu Clan along with Antera because she had someone she could call \\"friend\\" in her heart. =Shatora= ::Based on Catura of the Twelve Heavenly Generals serving Bhaisajyaguru Shatora (ÊãõÊùúÁæÖ) is the leader of the J≈´nishinsh≈ç, the foster-brother of Shiina Yuya, and the real brother of Sakuya: Nozomu. He was killed by Mibu Kyoshiro (who was tricked into doing so) for learning the Mibu's deepest secret. He was able to see into the past and was a valuable member of the Mibu Clan because of this ability. He was resurrected by the Mibu Clan, but his body was infused with the soul of Oda Nobunaga. In addition to his ability to see the past, he could resurrect any J≈´nishinsh≈ç that had been beaten and killed making him a very valuable asset. He is killed again by Kyo at his own request. In the anime, Shatora is the sister of Nobunaga Oda who is in love with her own brother and supports him in his goal of turning the world into \\" a hell of battles \\" so they can be together as lovers in the new world. She is a skilled swordswoman and magician who has the ability to create artificial bodies and transfer human souls, which she uses to revive her brother, first in his tree body and then later in Kyo's body. =Shindara= ::Based on Sindura of the Twelve Heavenly Generals serving Bhaisajyaguru In the past, when he belonged to the \\"Sanada J≈´y≈´shi\\", Shindara (ÁúüÈÅîÁæÖ) was called Sarutobi Sasuke. After being informed of Yukimura's premature death and his failure to seize hold of the country through the Taishirou Tokito's predictions, he left the Sanada and joined the Mibu to spy on them and to save Yukimura's life when the time comes. He is called the immortal one because Hishigi modified his body so he can regenerate instantaneously. He faces Yukimura and loses, but his motivation behind his betrayal is revealed. Later, he saves Sasuke from death and dies from mortal wounds beyond the healing capacity of his regeneration. After Bikara died, Shindara looked after Antera and acted as her parent keeping her at his side at all times. =The four demons of the J≈´nishinsh≈ç= The Mibu hide the true Indara, Haira, Mekira, and Kubira as they are merciless, blood-thirsty monsters. Members of the J≈´nishinsh≈ç, their places were taken by others when they were forced into hiding, deep within the lands of the Mibu. Mekira ::Based on Mihira of the Twelve Heavenly Generals serving Bhaisajyaguru Mekira (Ëø∑‰ºÅÁæÖ) is a man who has feminine characteristics. On his left arm are many Medusa Eyes, cheap imitations of the Devil Eye, which enable him to petrify his adversaries. He fights Akari, half petrifies Yuya, and completely petrifies Santera. Irritated by his treatment of Santera, Akari ungloves his left hand containing the \\"Devil Eye\\" and finally defeats Mekira, turning him to dust. He wielded a chain. Indara ::Based on Indra of the Twelve Heavenly Generals serving Bhaisajyaguru Similar to Mekira, Indara (Âõ†ÈôÄÁæÖ) was cruel and evil. She caused a confrontation between Makora (Kotarou) and Sasuke when they were still young. She has the ability to control living things (humans, like Fake Indara and Makora) and inanimate things (such as nature) with her song. She was defeated by Sasuke's Rage and Red-Eyes. She also wielded a big fan and had a tendency to repeat herself.  Kubira  ::Based on Khumbhira of the Twelve Heavenly Generals serving Bhaisajyaguru Kubira (ÂÆÆÊØòÁæÖ) could change his body into the form of the one who is most feared/respected by his opponent. This ability also made it possible for him to copy the abilities of the person whom he has replicated. He was defeated by Akira even though Kubira replicated Kyo's true body. Kubira was the father of Antera. He made a deal with the Taishirou to cure Antera's illness. Her illness could not be cured, but it could be \\"slowed\\" by returning her body to the age before infection and stopping her aging. Under this deal, the Taishirou made Kubira go \\"berserk\\" which made him feel hungry for flesh when he saw someone, even his own daughter. He also had to separate himself from his daughter whose memory was altered to forget him. Kubira died because he violated his deal with the Taishirou.  Haira  ::Based on Pajra of the Twelve Heavenly Generals serving Bhaisajyaguru Haira (Ê≥¢Â§∑ÁæÖ) has two shapes he can assume: a grotesquely obese form (which he favors, believing it to be good-looking) and a slim handsome one, which is actually much more powerful, that he assumes when he gets serious. Like the other berserkers, Haira is a cannibal, and all he can think about is food. He forces his victims to play word games with him, with the loser of each round getting assaulted by the winner. He initially got the better of the confused Bontenmaru, but he was eventually forced to change into his handsome form. He was killed after a fierce battle when Bontenmaru unleashed his full power. Haira's attack is called \\"union core.\\" Aka no Ou (The Crimson King) and The Red Cross Knights =Aka no Ou (Toudai - Current Crimson King)= The current ' is Ky≈çsabur≈ç, the third of the Red Cross Knights, created by the Former Crimson King. He is Ky≈çshir≈ç's older brother and Chinmei's younger brother, bearing an uncanny resemblance to Kyo. A kind King, his power was revoked and returned to the Former Crimson King, most likely due to his refusal to experiment on others to improve the Mibu Clan. He was killed by Kyoshiro after he was imprisoned, but attempted to open the door to the Former King's secret. After his death, the Former King reabsorbed his body into his own; however, near the end of the manga, he returns to Kyoshiro in spirit inside of the Former King to help him return to his body (Kyoshiro being absorbed by the Former King later on with Chinmei). Before he helps he tells Kyoshiro,\\"You are just as kind as he once was. You must forgive him, for he, more than anyone, wished for peace.\\" He refers to how the Former Crimson King was before his corruption. =Aka no Ou, (Shodai - First Crimson King)= The first Aka no Ou is Kyo's direct ancestor and the originator of the Mibu Clan. He is a very powerful spirit who lives in Kyo's sword, Tenr≈ç (Sky Wolf). He reveals himself to Kyo during his battle with Fubuki, and tells Kyo of the history of the Mibu Clan; of how it was once kind, prosperous, and powerful, but had degraded into a city of death and destruction created from their warring on each other. It was during this time that the True Mibu created Battle Dolls, much like the current Mibu's mutant experiments except for one major difference; these Dolls were given copy powers of the Red Eyes. By the end of the war, only a few True Mibu stood among several Battle Dolls. These dolls' descendants are now the Current Mibu, who are dying of an incurable disease. He then goes on to show Kyo how to use the True Red Eyes, and tells him that he is the last hope of the Mibu Clan. Aka no Ou, (Sendai - Former Crimson King) \\"I cannot be King if I do not know all of the Techniques of my subjects...\\" The former Aka no Ou () was of the previous generation of the Mibu. He was once kind and benevolent but became evil, most likely due to his near immortal status, which slowly drove him insane (such as Chinmei, who lost nearly any capability to feel, thus killing to keep his sanity). He foresaw this change in himself and told both Kyo and Shih≈çd≈ç to kill him should he ever hurt the Mibu Clan. Aka no Ou was the first of the Battle Dolls created by the true Mibu and the first of the Red Cross Knights. His real name is Kyoichiro. Kyoichiro is the father of Ky≈çshir≈ç, Chinmei, and Ky≈çsabur≈ç, who are all his clones. He is the greatest master of the Mumyou Jinpu Ryuu. He can execute three Suzaku compared to the normal one. He knows all four of the divine gods. His skills are so high that he can summon many god beasts at once. He finally fights against Kyo after the fight against Kyoushiro, and uses several high-level techniques to kill Kyo; at one point, the Former King re-absorbed the bodies and blood of his Red Knights, further increasing his own power with the return of his blood. Even though the Former King became very powerful, Kyo turned into a true demon (due to his sword), and was then thoroughly wounded. He then tries to become a demon god, the destructive form of true Mibu, but Sasuke and Benitora appear holding the Aka no Ou's heart, which has a cross on it. This cross means that the Aka no Ou is not a true Mibu, but instead the First Red Cross Knight, Mibu Kyouichirou; therefore, he cannot become a true Red Eyes demon god, such as Kyo. The Aka no Ou calls back his heart in an attempt end to his own life, destroying the Red Tower as well as himself. Of the Sendai Aka no Ou, he was portrayed as a great, mysterious, and benevolent King who doted on children and Kyo and even the defects the Mibu clan created. He was shown to be very affable with children, even playing with them, similar to the first Aka no Ou. He also defeated Hotaru easily, and instead of charging him with high treason, he sent Hotaru out to meet Kyo on the pretext of spying on him. He is always shown to be a mysterious dark figure with his face concealed at the start of the manga. Later, in volume 26 of the manga when Shinrei was imprisoned, the Sendai Aka no Ou makes his debut as a happy-go-lucky goofy bookworm hiding in the dungeon to read. He gave Shinrei new hope by asking him for the meaning of a certain phrase, which enlightened Shinrei. He then destroyed the barrier Hishigi set up for Shinrei with ease and set Shinrei free. Shinrei deduces that he is the Sendai Aka no Ou based on the fact that he claims to have sent Kyo out into the world years ago and that he has the power to destroy Hishigi's Taishirou barrier. The first true display of power comes when the newest Taishirou, Tokito, who is fed up by his goofiness and lack of seriousness, tries to shame him. He reads her mind easily and with just killing ki defeats her without moving. The next fight he has is when Yukimura tries to save Yuya and Sakuya. Even with Yukimura's wits, strength, and abilities, the Sendai Aka no Ou wins in a playful fashion, the only sign of trouble being that his glasses were cut. The ageless being Sendai Aka no Ou is ancient beyond imagination. The only other one who is closest to him is Shihoudou, who too is the eldest Taishirou ever. Both of them share a special bond, and the Sendai no Ou made her promise, a promise that he also made with Kyo, to kill him when he became evil. However, Shihoudou reveres and loves the Sendai Aka no Ou could not bring herself to do it at first. It is not clear when the change in Sendai no Ou truly began, but he reveals that it started because he gradually grew disgusted with the inherent flaws in human nature, especially the human love of violence. He had already foreseen himself becoming evil; therefore, he made a pact with Shihoudo and Kyo to kill him. He also cried blood, much like Chinmei, an allusion to the idea that both men had lost so much (literally and emotionally) that there was nothing left inside spiritually. A scene around the same time when Kyo was young also showed the Taishirous, including Muramasa, begging the Sendai Aka no Ou to save the race from the terminal disease which would eventually exterminate all of them. His smile was warm, but his voice was cold as he patted Muramusa on the head saying:\\"Do not worry. When you all die, I will create a new race more perfect and stronger than this one. So, go die peacefully...\\". It could be inferred that at this point evil had risen from the kindness in his heart. =Red Cross Knights= The Red Cross Knights are the personal guards of the Aka no Ou. Clones who were created from his flesh and blood, they are much stronger and more faithful than the Taishirou. Their true identities are so secretive anyone who wants to know their true identities is immediately ordered, by the Aka no Ou, to be executed. Only select members of the Mibu Clan actually know their true identities. Ky≈çichir≈ç Mibu Ky≈çichir≈ç is the former Aka no Ou of the previous generation of the Mibu. He was once kind and benevolent, but became evil ostensibly because of sheer boredom, but actually because he had lost faith in humanity after centuries of years of witnessing the dark side of human nature. He was the first of the Battle Dolls created by the true Mibu and the first of the Red Cross Knights. Ky≈çichir≈ç is the father of Ky≈çshir≈ç, Chinmei, and Ky≈çsabur≈ç, who are all his clones. He is the greatest master of the Mumyou Jinpu Ryuu. Ky≈çjir≈ç Shown as a Five Stars member, Chinmei is in fact Mibu Ky≈çjir≈ç, the Joker for the King, the 2nd Red Cross Knight. He utilizes the power of gravity to deliver devastating blows to his enemies, several of whom were underlings or former allies. Shown as a ruthless killer that uses a mask that asks for \\"Love and Peace\\" as he does his duty to himself or to his King. Faithful to the Aka no Ou, he has worked for him and only him since the beginning, until he wishes to bring back his lover. Like Ky≈çshir≈ç, he massacred thousands of people considered traitors under the command of the Aka no Ou, but his story is sad. His lover, a seer, had the same fate as Sakuya. She implored him to kill her, in order to end all the suffering, and Ky≈çjir≈ç reluctantly complied. His lover died, but Aka no Ou did not; although he knows of what he wishes, the resurrection of her, he has nearly all but forgotten how he felt about her as well as most of his memories of her. In order to keep his sanity, Chinmei creates as many games as possible for himself in order to feel any emotion. Later when both Kyoshiro and Kyojiro are absorbed by the former Aka no Ou, Kyojiro attempts to stop Kyosaburou from freeing Kyoshiro, only to aid him in his escape saying, \\"Go back to that world of pain,\\" and to \\"not give up and become an idiot like me.\\" At this point his tears of blood are replaced by normal tears. Ky≈çsabur≈ç Mibu Ky≈çsabur≈ç, the third of the Red Cross Knights, is the older brother of Ky≈çshir≈ç and younger brother of Chinmei, but had inherited the title of the Crimson King. Ky≈çsabur≈ç is the current Aka no Ou and has red eyes just like Kyo. He introduced Kyoshiro to Sakuya, but was later killed by Ky≈çshir≈ç (who was under the thrall of the Former Aka no Ou, Mibu Kyoichiro) when he tried to discover the Former Crimson King's greatest secret. His death shocks Kyoshiro in breaking free of the mind-control and causes him to flee the Mibu with Sakuya. Kyosaburo's body was then reabsorbed by the Former Aka no Ou, Mibu Ky≈çichir≈ç, but later on returns in spirit inside the Former King's body to help Kyoshiro return to his own body after being reabsorbed. He was the one who secretly taught Muramasa the Mibu Jinpuu Ryuu, which he called \\"a technique to kill God (the Former Crimson King)\\", just before he was killed. Ky≈çshir≈ç Taishir≈ç (The Four Elders) and The Imperial Guards The ' are the bodyguards of the Aka no Ou. They swore allegiance and fidelity to him. The Imperial Guards are the personal guards of the Taishirou. Their powers are much more powerful than some of the Goyosei. =Fubuki= Fubuki () was once Muramasa's best friend. He was a kinder man before Muramasa left the Mibu. Fubuki is not interested in maintaining the mutual relationship between the Mibu and the humans. He doesn't care about the many lives that will be lost once he starts a war between the two forces. Fubuki is also the teacher of Shinrei. He wielded the powers of water and wood. He is a master of Mumyo Saigyoryuu, just like his student Shinrei only Fubuki is far more powerful than Shinrei. Fubuki is also Muramasa's brother-in-law from his marriage to Hitoki, Muramasa's sister. Despite her ill health, Hitoki bore Fubuki a daughter, Tokito, though Tokito plays off as Muramasa's son. Fubuki dies when he impales himself with Shinrei's sword. However, before dying he entrusts the Mibu Clan to Shinrei and asks Kyo to take care of Tokito. As he asks a crying Tokito to see her face one last time, the former Aka no Ou launches a deadly attack at her but Fubuki gets in the away, finally dying, much to Tokito's, Shinrei's, and Kyo's dismay. =Hishigi= () One of the Taishirou. He is also called 'doctor' because he is the smartest among the Taishirou and is in charge of the experiments to find the cure for the Mibu Death Disease. He, Fubuki, and Muramasa were once good friends. Hishigi chose to stay with Fubuki and the Mibu when Muramasa left. While still trying to find the cure, unfortunately, Hishigi is also infected with the Death Disease. In order to continue his lifespan, he had to place part of a Medusa Eye in his body. To conserve the energy of his Medusa Eye, he has to wear a mask that covers half of his face. This is because if the Eye's energy is depleted he will die. He wields a huge sword named ‚ÄúHakuya‚Äù which means ‚ÄúWhite Night‚Äù which has the ability to perform a slash at the speed of light, which he used against Yuan, another one of the Taishirou. Before Hishigi died, he transferred his memories to Akari (Ashura) so that s/he might continue his research of finding the Death Disease's cure then transferred his hearts into Fubuki to keep him from dying during his fight with Kyo. Hishigi was once the head of the Four Elders at one point in time. Hishigi's Imperial Guards ;Ashura :Ashura is actually Akari. \\"He\\" came to the Mibu Clan and met Hishigi after he was rejected by the outside world. Hishigi took him in and taught him sword techniques. But because he knew too much Hishigi put the Devil Eye into Akari's left hand. Hishigi made Akari the leader of his Imperial Guard, but Akari ran away and met Kyo. Akari is #13, Captain of Hishigi's personal guard. :When the Devil Eye is activated, it takes over Akari's body and transforms him/her into Ashura. As Ashura, he loses all reasoning and obeys only Hishigi. His left arm is transformed into a sword. The sword is capable of turning people into stone when it touches them. =Tokito= (Voiced byYumi Kakazu) ' is known as the child of Muramasa, but Tokito really hates him, whom Tokito regards as a traitor. Tokito is able to determine the destiny of people using tarot cards and the candles of fate. Immature and cruel, Tokito enjoys the misfortune of others. In spite of being young, Tokito seems very strong, as being able to stop Bontenmaru's Kosoga with only three fingers. Tokito also has the last Muramasa sword, Hokuto Shichisei, which is a twin sword. In truth, Tokito is a girl who grew up playing as a boy. She is the daughter of Fubuki and Hitoki and is Muramasa's niece. She is defeated by Akira and joins Kyo's group. She falls in love with Akira for beating her and becomes his stalker. After the death of her father, she was terrified of the idea of being completely alone; however, both Julian and Botenmaru claim that she belongs to \\"their\\" family. Tokito's Imperial Guards ;Spade :Spade is the head of the Cards and the Imperial Guards of Tokito. He makes a short appearance, and we don't know much about him aside from the fact that he seems to know his Master well (such as his weaknesses). Spade is certain that he is stronger than the other Cards. Later, we learn that he died, probably killed by Chinmei, who took his place. ;Club, Diamond, and Heart :The Cards and the Imperial Guards of Tokito. They are able to speak with their swords. During their first battle with Shinrei, they won easily, but during their second battle with him, Shinrei killed them all in one blow. =Yuan= Yuan () is one of the Taishirou. He was the teacher of Keikoku (Hotaru), who called Yuan \\"Yun-Yun\\". Yuan has a rather relaxed attitude and tends to joke around though he is incredibly powerful. In the manga, Yuan is blind and wears a blind fold to conceal his Red Eyes trait. Although known primarily for his skills in Taijutsu and flame techniques, he later reveals a hidden mastery of swordsmanship, which he uses in tandem with the former two disciplines to create a formidable fighting style. His deadliest power is Genshigo, the power of illusions; using it he can fool opponents into believing they have incurred injuries far more intense than they have actually sustained in reality. Yuan seems to care for Hotaru like a son although he has a harsh way of showing it. Later in the manga, it is revealed that Yuan actually hates the Crimson King and never wanted to become a Taishirou. He only did this to protect his family and learn about the secret of his mother's death, the former leader of the Taishirou. Along with Tokito, he is one of the Taishirou survivors. Yuan's Imperial Guards ;Anthony :Anthony is one of the Imperial Guards of Yuan. He handles needles very well and can look after wounds and reveal the potential force within people. He is able to speak with his sword and is Yuan's first younger brother. He reveals the potential force within Hotaru, Shinrei, and Benitora following his defeat against Hotaru. ;Anna :Anna is one of the Imperial Guards of Yuan and is Yuan's first younger sister. She is the chef of the family. She often yells after cooking. That is why her siblings are frightened of her, including Yuan. ;Angelica :Angelica is one of the Imperial Guards of Yuan and is Yuan's second younger sister. She is the pretty one in the family. She helps Anna do chores, such as the laundry. :After Shinrei comments that Yuan is a \\"good older brother,\\" she claims that he is also a \\"good older brother\\" to Hotaru. ;Kirian :Kirian is one of the Imperial Guards of Yuan and is Yuan's younger brother. He's one of the quintuplets (Kirian, Yurian, Lilian, Erian, and Marian).

He's one of the quintuplets (Kirian, Yurian, Lilian, Erian, and Marian). He has a beard. ;Marian :Marian is one of the Imperial Guards of Yuan and is Yuan's younger sister. She's one of the quintuplets (Kirian, Yurian, Lilian, Erian, and Marian). She and Lilian start to take care of their weight after Hotaru leaves them. ;Lilian :Lilian is one of the Imperial Guards of Yuan and is Yuan's younger sister. She's one of the quintuplets (Kirian, Yurian, Lilian, Erian, and Marian). She and Marian start to take care of their weight after Hotaru leaves them. =Former Taishirou= Ian Ian is the mother of Yuan and is Julian's wife. A former Taishir≈ç, she was very powerful and was killed for knowing something she should not have known. Ian was very proud of her son Yuan. She put a stringcourse over his eyes so that nobody would discover that he had the red eyes. Muramasa (Voiced byKazuhiko Inoue) is a blacksmith and the maker of the famous Muramasa swords. He was a former Taishirou. Muramasa crafted Kyo's, Sasuke's and Benitora's legendary weapons. However, he carries a heavy burden of guilt for what the Mibu have done and, in Kyo, he saw the fall of the Mibu. He left the Mibu to teach Kyo, whom he loves as a son. (Kyo was then called the Demon Child due to the unknown manner of his birth and the fact that as soon as he was born, the Mibu stopped being able to have children.) Muramasa married a woman named Mayumi and stayed with her and her younger sister, Mahiro, in the mountains. He finally finds happiness with Mayumi but it is short-lived, as she is assassinated. Mahiro at first believes it was Kyo and thus swears to kill him, but it is later revealed to be Chinmei. Muramasa is several hundred years old, but appears young due to a technique called \\"Sei\\", used by Mibu elders to stay alive indefinitely. Unfortunately for Muramasa, even his Sei is being wasted away by a deadly illness. He has attained Satori, which allows him to read the thoughts of others. He is also a powerful swordsman, as strong as Kyo. The illness is later reveal to be called the Death Disease, a design flaw in all Mibu constructs. The disease disintegrates their bodies. After helping Kyo in his mission, he dies of the disease and crumbles away into the wind above his wife's grave. Before catching the Death Disease, Muramasa was probably the most powerful Mibu. Even Kyo admits that Muramasa was above him. =Muramasa's Imperial Guards= ;Anri :Anri appears during the flashback of chapter 201. Muramasa charged him with involving Yukimura. Anri teaches the Sekireigan (which the reason for his nickname, the Terrible One) to Yukimura. Anri is the Imperial Guard of Muramasa, and when Muramasa dies, Anri's only objective is to get his family to a safe place. He is the first son of Julian and Ian. Yuan at one point reveals that he has met a woman in Kyoto and has had 11 children, with a twelfth on the way. Shihoudou Shihoudou is the eldest Taishirou who appears in the manga. The Aka no Ou completely relies on her and makes her promise to kill him if he ever became corrupted. Unable to kill him, she decides to stay underground, where the failures of the Mibu Clan are thrown. In spite of her appearance, she is frightening, and one should not underestimate her. Her hat is believed to weigh 1,000 tons. She has mastered her Kusanagi sword, in which the Eight Headed Snake lives. Although she appears to be an idiotic, vulgar, nonsensical woman on the outside, she is actually very passionate and emotional. Instances that suggest this include: she allowed Muramasa to take Kyo away, resulting in a beating that immobilized her body for three months; she also memorized each of the failures in the underground dungeon, built graves for them, and covered the lands with mushroom-like clouds. She respects and secretly loves the Sendai Aka no Ou. However, she could never face her feelings for him and spent her time weeping underground when the Sendai Aka no Ou asked her to kill him. Using her own Red Eyes, she managed to pierce her blade straight through the Sendai Aka no Ou's body, but to no avail... he could not be killed so simply. The Sendai Aka no Ou then proceeded to attack her to 'thank her for trying so hard to honor their promise'. At the final death of the Sendai Aka no Ou, he fell to the bottom-most pit of the tower, the underground dungeon. There he landed in the graveyard of cloud-mushrooms and cried blood once last time, and then tears before perishing in a shower of rubble and cloud-mushrooms. Shihoudou felt his death and hesitated for a moment. In the epilogue, Shihoudou was lazing in a field of new cloud-mushrooms and a newly erected grave bore the hat of the Sendai Aka no Ou. Goy≈çsei (The Five Shining Stars) The ' is the group of five who rank below the Taishir≈ç. Their duty is to carry out the orders of their superiors in the hierarchy. All five have their element tattooed on their necks. =Chinmei= () Supposedly an advocate for love and peace, the violent Chinmei is actually a Red Cross Knight and was most recognizable for dressing like a hippie. Chinmei is one of the Red Cross Knights, created from the flesh and blood of the former Aka no Ou. He cannot be killed with a normal sword, only with a true Muramasa. In the Mibu Clan, he became the joker for the former Aka no Ou and gave very useful information about Kyo, Kyoshiro, the Goy≈çsei, and the Taishir≈ç. He also became one of the five members of the Goy≈çsei, and his speciality is in controlling the Earth (Mumyo Dai'onryu). He never uses a weapon in battle but uses two small fans to defend and shoot his techniques. His job was to steal all four of Muramasa's swords, Tenro, Shibien, Hokurakushimon, and Hokuto Shichisei, and bring them to the former Aka no Ou. The former Aka no Ou wants the swords destroyed since they alone can kill or hurt the Red Cross Knights and himself. It is revealed that he loved the former seer (the seer before Sakuya), and that he cherished her very much. However, she, being able to see the future, was afraid of the destruction she might help cause due to the Aka no Ou, pleaded Chinmei to kill her, to which he regrettably complied. He cries blood, claiming that he has cried so much that he has run out of tears. He reveals to Kyoshiro that he had given up in living in this world because he didn't want to remember any of the painful things that had happened to him. Chinmei met Kyo for the first time in Muramasa's house when he killed Mayumi in order to get Tenro. He was then attacked by Kyo who took the Tenro, but he left instantly. The second time he fought Kyo, he lost and was supposedly killed. During Chinmei's last battle with Yukimura and Sasuke, he showed his Shin Red Eyes, but Sasuke still defeated him with Yukimura. Chinmei is a powerful enemy even for Kyo. Yukimura cut him in half using the short sword that Muramasa made for Yuya. However, Chinmei survived. He was finally killed when the former Aka no Ou reabsorbed him for more power. Before fully dying, he aids Kyoshiro in escaping from inside the former Aka no Ou's body, telling Kyoshiro to not be a fool like him and protect Sakuya with all his might, something that Chinmei failed to do for his dead lover. =Keikoku= Before Hotaru joined the Shiseiten, he was known as Keikoku of the Five. He joined the Shiseiten as a spy for the Aka no Ou. He controls the element of Fire. He later quits the Goy≈çsei after Kyo defeats him. Keikoku resigns from his position when Mibu soldiers ordered him to commit suicide. He asked for something to write with and use a brush pen to cross out the 'Fire' sign on his neck then killed all the soldiers in his sight. =Saisei and Saishi= The Goy≈çsei's resurrection specialists dressed like nurses. Saishi is the only one of the two who is truly a Goy≈çsei. She resurrected Saisei (actually Tomoe Gozen), who is a zombie who fights for her. Saisei () uses a naginata to fight with; Saishi () uses her bare fists and brute strength. Combat seems to be a last resort for the two of them, as they usually use zombies to fight their battles, including a few legendary warriors as well as naked and cannibalistic women. They control the element of Wood. Saisei was killed by Akira after he defeated her ability to warp damage to her opponent, but he respected her since she was fighting so hard to protect Shinrei, whom she secretly loved. Saishi, on the other hand, was viewed as a monster by Akira, and he used his best technique to destroy every cell in her body after she used a bunny-girl costume and physical attacks. They are significantly different in the anime, except in appearance. Saisei and Saishi are \\"living dolls\\" that have many copies that try to overwhelm Kyo and even attack Yuya. Eventually Saisei transforms her clothes into armor and a naginata (just like the manga), and absorbs Yuya. Yuya while inside the void inside Saisei is able to destroy Saisei's core, and later Saishi's core with her gun. There is no mention of Saisei being Tomoe Gozen in the anime. =Shinrei= '; () is an ex-member of the Goy≈çsei who has great loyalty to the Mibu Clan. He hates Kyo for abandoning the Mibu and ruining their plan for domination. He dislikes Hotaru (Keikoku), as the latter always provokes him and has no loyalty to the Mibu. The eldest son of a noble man of the Mibu and his official wife, Shinrei was the rightful heir of his branch. He has been taught to be totally loyal to the Mibu and has devoted his life to them. He has a cold and serious personality; though sometimes he loses his cool easily, especially if he is provoked by Hotaru (Keikoku), his rival and half-brother. Shinrei was told about his relation to Hotaru in his youth. After learning that fact, he has kept his eyes on his little brother from the shadows. It was Shinrei who stopped his father from sending assassins to kill Hotaru and who secretly helped Hotaru participate in the competition for a position in the Goy≈çsei (which is only open to competitors from noble families of the Mibu). However, he never showed himself as Hotaru's brother until his last fight with Hotaru and Kyo. Despite their contradiction and contrast, Shinrei and Hotaru hold a strong bond between them, but they consider each other as siblings and rivals. After their final bout, their bond becomes stronger and the two even start to fight together. Shinrei fights with a \\"dancing sword technique\\" as his fight looks much like a dance. The technique is dangerous and nearly overwhelms Kyo. Being of incredible skill, Shinrei's abilities increase as the skills of his opponent increase. The technique is based on a seemingly simple, but rather impossible, practice. He first slashes, and his opponent moves accordingly to counter his attack. While his opponent is moving to counter his attack, Shinrei redirects his attack with near impossible speed so that although it appears as if his opponent is blocking, that opponent will actually get hit instead. This is soon countered by Kyo who simply closes his eyes and \\"senses\\" Shinrei's blade. Shinrei was trained personally by Fubuki. Shinrei's father is the founder of the Mumyou Saikyou Ryuu School of Water, so Shinrei controls the element of Water. After Kyo defeats his Dancing Sword Technique and wounds him, Shinrei forms a sword out of his own blood. His ultimate technique is the Mumyou Saikyou Ryuu, the Seven Water Split Dragon. Shinrei's left eye becomes red in moments of great stress, in contrast to his younger brother. Saisei's death along with Taihaku's regularly pushes Shinrei to fight. In the end, it appears that Shinrei becomes the \\"leader\\" of the Mibu Clan and rebuilds it along with Yuan's family and the creatures from the forest. In the bonus chapter, it is revealed that he started performing with his water dragons in the rebuilt Water Dance Stage. =Taihaku= () A true genius of combat, ' is the head of the Goy≈çsei. He knows many things about the Mibu Clan and knows Shiina Nozomo very well. He is a very kind person who saves and secretly raises many of the Mibu \\"rejects\\". He entered the Mibu when Aka no Ou saved him in the Jiyukai of Aokigahara in the past. He is actually a human whose lifespan was lengthened by the Aka no Ou. He has incredible speed despite his appearance. He managed to severely wound Benitora before he was defeated. He was killed by Fubuki because he \\"betrayed\\" the Mibu by wanting to join Kyo in defeating them. Unlike the other four Stars, Taihaku does not hold powers over an element. Though his tattoo is of the character for gold, he doesn't wield a \\"golden power\\". Rather, Taihaku is the perfect samurai. His skills, determination, and power is unmatched by all but Benitora. Mibu Clan related =Hitoki= Hitoki is Muramasa's sister. She is the first of Mibu Clan to get infected by the Death Disease and is the specimen for the reincarnation of the Mibu plan. She was hidden in the Aka no Ou's palace so nobody would know about the Disease. She was married to Fubuki and was the mother of Tokito. =Julian= Julian is the blacksmith of the Mibu Clan and also the father of Yuan. Gifted at making weapons, he taught Muramasa how to smith, but his fighting ability is only above average overall. Like his son, Yuan, Julian seeks to avenge his wife, Ian. =Ruru/Lulu= () Ruru is the little girl who stays with the Sendai Aka no Ou. She chides him constantly about his mistakes, even pushing his head into a pillar. She likes playing with her toys in her left hand, making her one of the few left-handed people in the series. She also brings information to Fubuki and Hishigi. Ruru is one of the two successful Rare Breeds created by Hishigi, the other being Sasuke. Hishigi mentions that her brother (Sasuke) will destroy his laboratory. At the end of the manga, the reason why the Sendai Aka no Ou keeps her around is because she has the antibody to the death diseases (the cure and hope of the Mibu people). =Sakuya= () Sakuya is a very powerful woman within the clan who has won the loyalties of many people, including Sanada Yukimura. She can predict the future, as she is a seer. Her brother, Shiina Nozumi, being a shaman, could see into a person's past. She had something to do with the outcome of the Battle of Sekigahara and the appearance/disappearance of Demon Eyes Kyo. In the anime, she is shown using her powers physically, and it is heavily implied that both Kyo and Kyoshiro were apparently in love with her at some point, as she was with them; in the early part of the series they are actively searching for her. In the manga, she does not show any physical manifestations of power. It is clarified that she had always been in love with Kyoshiro, not Kyo, and remains in love with Kyoshiro while being worried over Kyo. Kyo is, however, seen as a dear friend to her and Kyoshiro. She is yet again, shown as the initial reason for the disagreement, and eventually the body stealing/soul swapping, between Kyo and Kyoshiro. =Shiina Nozomu= Shiina Nozomu was killed by Kyoshiro four years ago in front of his adopted sister, Yuya. Nozomu was, in truth, one of the greatest shaman of the Mibu Clan. He took the young Yuya in when she was a child after he found her on the streets. This man knew the valuable secret of the Mibu Clan and it is for that knowledge that he was killed. Before dying, he transmitted this secret to his biological sister, the shaman Sakuya. Sanada Clan and Juuyuushi =Sanada Yukimura= See Sanada Yukimura and Juuyuushi (Sanada Ten Braves). =Sanada Nobuyuki= ' () is Yukimura's older brother and he appears in books 2 and 4. He joined the Tokugawa Clan at Battle of Sekigahara, seeming to betray his brother, which generated much animosity between the siblings. He and Yukimura fight at the Shogun Tournament, and it is later revealed that during the fight he was actually trying to teach Yukimura a lesson. Nobuyuki never betrayed the family as Yukimura thought; he joined the other side so that no matter who becomes the Shogun, the Sanada Clan would be on the winning side and survive. Since Nobuyuki and Yukimura both give their ages as thirty-seven and appear virtually identical, they may be twins. In the anime, he has defected from the Sanada family to become the loyal retainer of Benitora, who stopped him from committing seppuku after his failure caused the Tokugawa clan a major strategic defeat just before the battle at Sekigahara. He fights his brother in the tournament at the capital but loses. In the end of the show, he continues to fight by Benitora's side as his lieutenant even against his own family when the other clans rebel against the Shogunate. =Mizuki= Mizuki is a friend of Yukimura who is first introduced in a flashback in volume 11. Her main desire is for her father to not be as protective of herself and her mother; it's strongly hinted that she and Yukimura were falling in love with each other. Yukimura promises to protect her, but that same evening Tokugawa attacks the city and Yukimura is unable to save Mizuki, who gives him her father's sword before dying in his arms. She correctly predicts that he will become much stronger and that there are people who need him. Her death prompts Yukimura's inner \\"dragon\\" to awaken and turns him into a fierce \\"demon\\" who punishes evil. Even twenty years after her death, Yukimura and Saizo still mourn her and Yukimura still carries the sword she gave him. =Sanada Juuyuushi (Sanada Ten Braves)= The ' are the ones who have sworn to protect Sanada Yukimura with their lives. =Sarutobi Sasuke= See Sarutobi Sasuke =Kirigakure Saizo= Kirigakure Saizo (ÈúßÈö†ÊâçËîµ Kirigakure Saiz≈ç) () is one of the Sanada Jyuuyuushi and also a very good ninja. He has been devoted to Yukimura since his childhood, and will even turn against other members of the Sanada clan to protect his master. He has even been critically injured defending Yukimura in battle. Despite his devotion to Yukimura, Saizo is often exasperated by his master's casual attitude and often worries about him. But he respects and fears Yukimura's abilities and ultimately will do anything he says, and his selfless devotion has also earned Yukimura's respect and caring. In the anime adaptation, it is strongly implied that Saizo harbors a romantic crush on Yukimura. =Anayama Kosuke= Kosuke (Á©¥Â±±Â∞èÂä©); ) belongs to the Sanada Jyuuyuushi. She is also the female double of Yukimura. Her main responsibility at the beginning is to remain in Kudoyama and take care of Sakuya. In the anime, it is shown that she is in love with her master. =The Remaining Members of the Sanada Ten= Kakei J≈´z≈ç Servant to Sanada Yukimura. He fights Chinmei with the other Sanada Jyuuyuushi. Miyoshi Isa Miyoshi Isa is one of the Ny≈´dos Brothers in the Sanada Jyuuyuushi. He can attack by himself or combine with his brother, Miyoshi Seikai. Together they form a terrible duet able to combine their attacks. They also can form into a single body. Yukimura tells them to wear glasses because their eyes are pretty and their movements always alike. They protected Sakuya in the Red Tower. Miyoshi Seikai Miyoshi Seikai is one of the Ny≈´dos Brothers in the Sanada Jyuuyuushi. He can attack by himself or combine with his brother, Miyoshi Isa. Together they form a terrible duet able to combine their attacks. They also can form into a single body. Yukimura tells them to wear glasses because their eyes are pretty and their movements always alike. They protected Sakuya in the Red Tower. Mochizuki Rokur≈ç Servant to Sanada Yukimura. He is in Mount Kudoyama and acted as lining with Yukimura. Nezu Jinpachi Jinpachi is quite similar to Kamanosuke. He was a disciple of Shindara when he was still Sasuke of the Sanada Jyuuyuushi. Jinpachi's weapon is attached on his left arm, which looks like a blade of some sort, like two long claws. Unno Rokur≈ç Servant to Sanada Yukimura. He fights Chinmei with the other Sanada Jyuuyuushi. Yuri Kamanosuke Yuri Kamanosuke appears when Yukimura fights Shindara. She is the cook of the group and her specialty is bear stew. She speaks with an Akita accent. She uses two large scythes as her weapons. Like the other Sanada Jyuuyuushi, Kamanosuke believes in Yukimura and will follow him until death. Other characters =Tokugawa Ieyasu= Tokugawa Ieyasu is the father of Benitora (Hidetada) and the daimyo of the Tokugawa clan. In the manga, he is portrayed as a middle-aged man and a ruthless daimyo; he pretended to be Hattori Hanz≈ç and used a double, a fat balding lieutenant of the Tokugawa clan, to play his role. Following the Shogun Tournament, he reveals himself to Kyo and the others. Later on in the story, he entrusts the Hokuraku Shimon to Benitora and helps Kyo defeat the former Crimson King. In the anime, however, Ieyasu's appearance is that of double in the manga, and the Hattori Hanz≈ç in the anime is the real Ieyasu himself in the manga. In the anime, Ieyasu is secretly being controlled by Santera, and eventually turns into a Kenyou which is killed by his son Hidetada (Benitora). =Mahiro= () Mahiro is Muramasa's sister-in-law. Although they are not blood-related, Mahiro, her sister Mayumi, and Muramasa are like a real family. Four years ago, Mahiro arrived home and saw Kyo beside her sister's dead body, holding a bloody sword in hand. She swore to avenge her sister and became a ninja under Tokugawa Ieyasu. She, like many characters, has a longer and larger role in the manga, assisting Benitora for a large part of the series. In the anime, in the epilogue, she is in love with her master Benitora and is pregnant with his child 11 years after the battle against Nobunaga (Benitora says to her, \\"Take care. You are responsible for two now\\" just before final battle against the rebel clans). =Mayumi= Mayumi is Mahiro's sister and was married to Muramasa for a period of time after he escaped from the Mibu clan. She was killed four years ago by Chinmei, not Kyo (as Mahiro believes), before which she gave Kyo his sword, Tenrou (forged by Muramasa). However, Mahiro doesn't find out the truth until much later in the story. =Migeira= Migeira () is not featured in the manga. He has short snow-white hair, two different colored eyes (one blue and one red), and wears a futuristic caped uniform with a dark purple bandanna covering the lower part of his face. His weapon, one of the Five Muramasas, is a 5-barreled gun called the Hashagou that he wears on his right arm. Its ammunition seems to be his soul or spiritual power. Migeira says that the first Muramasa was taken to China, and changed by Western alchemists into the form of a gun that he later tracked down. He also has the ability to see \\"the future\\" (or more correctly, the proper timeline that historically \\"should\\" have happened) and belongs to Kyou no Miyako, a secret order dedicated to governing the path of history. Because Kyo inhabits a body with two souls, this has caused a disturbance in the time line that Migeira seeks to rectify. He seems nonchalant most of the time, but sometimes gives wise advice to the characters or speaks passionately about his own sense of justice. =Jimon= Jimon is a minor character and is one of the first to reveal Demon Eyes Kyo. Kyo shamed him at the Battle of Sekigahara by not killing him and by looking down on him like he was worthless trash. He took a job as a yojimbo to a local Daikan and killed 107 people to perfect his technique and be ready to face Kyo again to regain his honor. He is a master of Hien Ken, a move that allows him to draw his sword and strike three times in the blink of an eye. Kyo challenged him to a drawing match, although Kyo's sword was almost twice as long and had no sheath. Kyo allowed Jimon to draw first, then easily kills Jimon by cutting Jimon almost in half. =Kenyou= A breed of demonic monster that exist only in the anime. During the Battle of Sekigahara, a shooting star fell, turning the tide of victory to the Eastern Army; an explosion from the asteroid turned certain humans into monsters called Kenyou. Many villainous characters in the anime are Kenyou, to the point where no human villains seem to exist. It is never explained whether their evil intentions were originally part of their personalities, or were acquired with their mutated forms. The kenyou are exclusively in the anime, and do not appear in the manga (where all of the characters that the anime identifies as kenyou are human with extraordinary powers). Nearly all the antagonists in the anime eventually transform into monsters, which is one of the biggest differences between the manga and anime.

History Built in 1908 as Washington Township Hall, the building previously served as the seat of the Washington Township, Montgomery County, Ohio government, providing meeting space for township trustees and a central hub for community activities such as graduations and public performances. It served as the Washington Township government offices until 1985. In 1989, the township decided to turn the Centerville, Ohio landmark into a performing art center. With the help of a grant, a theatre company, the All Children's Theatre. Between 1992 and 1996, the building was renovated, resulting in a newly refurbished auditorium, lobby, and rehearsal room, as well as the installation of an accessible ramp entrance and restrooms, a dance studio, and a scene shop. Town Hall Theatre is dedicated to the presentation of theater for young audiences and presents about eight to ten shows per season. It does this through the three producing arms of All Children's Theatre. The Landmark Children's Theatre Company features professional adult actors performing alongside volunteer community adult performers and youth. The All Children's Theatre features large, all-ages cast shows ranging from grades 2‚Äì12. The ACT Touring Teens feature high school students grades 7‚Äì12 performing on an in- school tour. In addition to the production schedule, the theatre offers classes in acting, dance, and music. The Town Hall is owned by the Washington Township Recreation Center, which sponsors performing arts summer camps at the theatre. Each year, the Town Hall Theatre performs for over 20,000 audience members and involves over 400 community volunteers in every facet of its productions. In 2019, a disagreement arose between the city of Centerville and Washington Township regarding how to use the open space adjacent to the theater, with the Township preferring to keep it as green space. Both parties bid on the property; Centerville won the bid.

Originally released on arcade, it utilizes a light gun on the platform, but can be played with standard controllers on consoles and a mouse or keyboard on home computers. For the PlayStation Network releases of III and 4, they can also be played using the PlayStation Move controller. As of 2018, there are six House of the Dead games originating in a first person rail shooter format available. The main series all have common elements of a pair of agents teaming up to take on hordes of biologically engineered undead (referred to as 'mutants' in Overkill). The games are divided into chapters, each of which culminates in a boss battle against usually massive, terrifying creatures. The bosses in the first four games as well as the sixth are all named after the Major Arcana of occult tarot. Gameplay elements differ among the different games in the series, with each having different characters, firearms, and types of enemies. In many of the games, there are branching paths (determined by one's actions) and unlockable bonuses, along with different endings based on one's performances. Several spin-offs to the mainstream storyline have also been produced (including a virtual pinball game, an English tutorial and a typing tutorial), as well as a film trilogy. In addition, select enemy characters appearing in the first two games were adapted into fully articulated action figures by Palisade Toys, which canceled the second toy line before street release due to limited returns from the first series. The House of the Dead has been, along with Resident Evil, credited with popularising zombie video games as well as re- popularising zombies in mainstream popular culture from the late 1990s onwards, leading to renewed interest in zombie films during the 2000s. The House of the Dead has also been credited with introducing fast running zombies, which became popular in zombie films and video games during the 2000s. Gameplay The main gameplay mechanic is the on-rails shooting mechanic. The player must clear each area of enemies before advancing to the next area. The first two installments featured pistols, the third featured a shotgun, the fourth and Scarlet Dawn featured a submachine gun. Overkill features different firearms which can be changed to the players' liking. The instructions on the cabinets note that a head shot is the most effective way to kill zombies. Successful clearing will result in boss battles. Before most battles, the game will show what the bosses' weak point is. Final bosses have no identifiable weak point. If the boss is shot enough times, it will recoil; otherwise, it will take one of the player's lives. In most of the games, the bosses are named after Major Arcana cards. They are also classified by 'types', which are shown as either a number or Greek letter. There are also some different branching paths in the games, that are usually accessed by shooting a door or an object and sometimes when a civilian is killed. The first two The House of the Dead games featured civilians. If the player successfully rescued civilians from the zombies, the civilian would sometimes reward the player with an extra life. The fourth did not feature civilians. In the third game, occasionally the player's partner would get in trouble and the player would be rewarded if he or she saved the partner's life. Players can also obtain extra lives by shooting boxes, crates, vases and destructible scenery. Scarlet Dawn once again features the civilians from the first two games, alongside the partner rescue mechanics from the third game, alongside new mechanics such as weapon switching and quick time events. All main games have multiple endings, depending on how well the player did in terms of civilians rescued, shooting percentage, score, and lives left. Every main game excepted the last one have \\"bad\\" ending, usually involving one of the characters transforming into a zombie. In 1 the character turning was Sophie Richards, 2 is Goldman, III is Daniel Curien and 4 is, once again, Goldman. Main series =The House of the Dead (1996)= On December 18, 1998, the insane and disillusioned Dr. Roy Curien plans to mobilize his armies of undead against the unsuspecting populace. AMS agents Thomas Rogan and \\"G\\" are dispatched to his mansion to stop Curien and rescue Rogan's future wife, Sophie Richards. =The House of the Dead 2 (1998)= On February 26, 2000, Goldman, the man behind the Curien Mansion case, claims responsibility. Fueled by his detest of humankind's complete lack of responsibility toward its assigned task, Goldman initiates an undead outbreak on Venice while his Emperor project develops. Two new agents named James Taylor and Gary Stewart are sent in order to stop Goldman. =The House of the Dead III (2002)= In the post-apocalyptic world of 2019, Thomas Rogan and his team of commandos infiltrate the EFI Research Facility in hopes of finding the source of the planet's collapse. Losing contact with him, his daughter Lisa Rogan and his former partner \\"G\\" set out on a search and recover mission, unaware that what awaits them has ties to the distant past and the very genesis of the undead horde. Daniel Curien, son of the late Dr. Curien, later teams up with Lisa to help complete the rest of the mission. =The House of the Dead 4 (2005)= In the year 2003, veteran AMS agent James Taylor (from The House of the Dead 2) and newcomer Kate Green are investigating the Goldman Incident of 2000.

Film adaptations In 2003, the first film, directed by Uwe Boll and produced by Brightlight Pictures, was released. Given a limited theatrical release with the intent of becoming a cult film, it served as a loose prequel to the game, but received very poor reviews and little box office return. In 2004, a sequel to the first film was greenlit but direct-to-DVD. The previous director was unable to direct the sequel due to commitments to his other films, and Michael Hurst was chosen to take his place. the sequel is closer to its source, featuring AMS agents going to a school to stop a zombie outbreak from spreading. however the film was also poorly received. Another sequel was announced. Mindfire Entertainment co-founder Mark Altman has stated in discussions that \\"It's a completely different approach to the material than the first two films.\\" It was also stated that it may not be called House of the Dead 3 as Sega wasn't releasing the latest installment on home consoles.\\" Eventually, Mindfire Entertainment released Dead and Deader starring Dean Cain and the House of the Dead name was not attached.

The success of these two 1996 zombie games inspired a wave of Asian zombie films, such as Bio Zombie (1998) and Versus (2000), for example. The zombie revival which began in the Far East eventually went global following the worldwide success of Japanese zombie games such as Resident Evil and The House of the Dead. Their success led to a wave of Western zombie films during the 2000s, such as 28 Days Later (2002) and Shaun of the Dead (2004), for example. In 2013, George Romero said it was the video games Resident Evil and House of the Dead \\"more than anything else\\" that popularised his zombie concept in mainstream popular culture. The House of the Dead has also been credited with introducing a new type of zombie distinct from Romero's classic slow zombie: the fast running zombie. After first appearing in The House of the Dead, they became popular in zombie films and video games during the 2000s, including the Resident Evil games and films, The House of the Dead film adaptation, and the films 28 Days Later (2002) and Dawn of the Dead (2004).

The film was originally banned in Britain as a 'video nasty' and released with cuts in 1993, but was finally released uncut on DVD in the UK during 2006, after changes in British censorship policy. Synopsis Killer Nun (1978) was produced in Italy. It features Anita Ekberg as Sister Gertrude, who is recovering from the removal of a brain tumor, although her Mother Superior (Alida Valli) dismisses Sister Gertrude's fears about a rushed recovery. Unfortunately, soon enough, it becomes clear that Sister Gertrude's fears were legitimate, as the hapless nun spirals into psychosis and addiction to morphine and heroin at the geriatric hospital where she works. As well as initiating a lesbian affair with Sister Mathieu (Paola Morra), Sister Gertrude stomps on an elderly woman's dentures, reads gory hagiographic details of the lives of tortured saints to her hapless charges, goes into a nearby town, picks up a man at a bar, and has impersonal sex, then returns to the hospital and maneuvers to have concerned Dr Poirret (Massimo Serato) dismissed due to his age. A handsome new doctor, Dr. Patrick Roland (Joe Dallesandro), arrives and becomes suspicious of Sister Gertrude, after Sister Gertrude is accused of throwing an elderly man engaged in sex with a nurse out of a window, inflicts grueling calisthenics on elderly patients, and takes a patient's crutches, forcing him to crawl. Finally. the Mother Superior is convinced that she must do something about her aberrant behavior... but is Sister Gertrude really the perpetrator of murder, or is someone trying to frame her?

Unlike other examples of the genre, usually set in medieval or Renaissance locations, Killer Nun is firmly set in the present day, and has no pretensions to social commentary or any remarks about the role of religious women within the Church or the larger society. In the United Kingdom, Mary Whitehouse denounced it as one of the \\"video nasties\\" subgenre of violent horror cinema, which 'might' adversely affect human behaviour. Although it was originally on a 'DPP list' of 'objectionable' films in the United Kingdom, compiled by the Director of Public Prosecutions in 1983 as a result of the aforementioned moral panic and released with 13 seconds of cuts in 1993. Liberalised British film, video and DVD censorship policy meant that a DVD of the film was released in the UK during 2006 in its uncut form.

People with this syndrome are particularly prone to developing a common and usually non-life-threatening form of non-melanoma skin cancer. About 10% of people with the condition do not develop basal-cell carcinomas (BCCs). The name Gorlin syndrome refers to the American oral pathologist and human geneticist Robert J. Gorlin (1923‚Äì2006).Burgdorf W. Robert J. Gorlin (1923 ‚Äì 2006). In: L√∂ser C, Plewig G, Hrsg. Pantheon der Dermatologie. Heidelberg, Springer 2008: 362‚Äì366 The American dermatologist Robert W. Goltz (1923‚Äì2014)Burgdorf WH, Padilla RS, Hordinsky M. In memoriam: Robert W. Goltz (1923-2014). J Am Acad Dermatol 2014; 71: e163‚Äìe165 was his co-author, which is the basis for the term 'Gorlin-Goltz syndrome'. First described in 1960 by Gorlin and Goltz, NBCCS is an autosomal dominant condition that can cause unusual facial appearances and a predisposition for basal-cell carcinoma, a type of skin cancer which rarely spreads to other parts of the body. The prevalence is reported to be 1 case per 56,000‚Äì164,000 population. Recent work in molecular genetics has shown NBCCS to be caused by mutations in the PTCH (Patched) gene found on chromosome arm 9q. If a child inherits the defective gene from either parent, he or she will have the disorder. Signs and symptoms Some or all of the following may be seen in someone with Gorlin syndrome: # Multiple basal-cell carcinomas of the skin # Odontogenic keratocyst: Seen in 75% of patients and is the most common finding. There are usually multiple lesions found in the mandible. They occur at a young age (19 yrs average). # Rib and vertebrae anomalies # Intracranial calcification # Skeletal abnormalities: bifid ribs, kyphoscoliosis, early calcification of falx cerebri (diagnosed with AP radiograph) # Distinct faces: frontal and temporoparietal bossing, hypertelorism, and mandibular prognathism # Bilateral ovarian fibromas # 10% develop cardiac fibromas Cause Mutations in the human homologue of Drosophila patched (PTCH1), a tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 9, were identified as the underlying genetic event in this syndrome. Diagnosis Diagnosis of NBCCS is made by having 2 major criteria or 1 major and 2 minor criteria. The major criteria consist of the following: # more than 2 BCCs or 1 BCC in a person younger than 20 years; # odontogenic keratocysts of the jaw # 3 or more palmar or plantar pits # ectopic calcification or early (<20 years) calcification of the falx cerebri # bifid, fused, or splayed ribs # first- degree relative with NBCCS. The minor criteria include the following: # macrocephaly. # congenital malformations, such as cleft lip or palate, frontal bossing, eye anomaly (cataract, coloboma, microphthalmia, nystagmus). # other skeletal abnormalities, such as Sprengel deformity, pectus deformity, polydactyly, syndactyly or hypertelorism. # radiologic abnormalities, such as bridging of the sella turcica, vertebral anomalies, modeling defects or flame- shaped lucencies of hands and feet. # ovarian and cardio fibroma or medulloblastoma (the latter is generally found in children below the age of two). People with NBCCS need education about the syndrome, and may need counseling and support, as coping with the multiple BCCs and multiple surgeries is often difficult. They should reduce UV light exposure, to minimize the risk of BCCs. They should also be advised that receiving Radiation therapy for their skin cancers may be contraindicated. They should look for symptoms referable to other potentially involved systems: the CNS, the genitourinary system, the cardiovascular system, and dentition. Genetic counseling is advised for prospective parents, since one parent with NBCCS causes a 50% chance that their child will also be affected. Treatment Treatment is usually supportive treatment, that is, treatment to reduce any symptoms rather than to cure the condition. * Enucleation of the odontogenic cysts can help, but new lesions, infections and jaw deformity are usually a result. * The severity of the basal-cell carcinoma determines the prognosis for most patients. BCCs rarely cause gross disfigurement, disability or death . * Genetic counseling Incidence NBCCS has an incidence of 1 in 50,000 to 150,000 with higher incidence in Australia. One aspect of NBCCS is that basal- cell carcinomas will occur on areas of the body which are not generally exposed to sunlight, such as the palms and soles of the feet and lesions may develop at the base of palmar and plantar pits. One of the prime features of NBCCS is development of multiple BCCs at an early age, often in the teen years. Each person who has this syndrome is affected to a different degree, some having many more characteristics of the condition than others.

Etymology The names are from Avestan, nominally transliterated as ' and ', but like other Avestan words also, spellings (and hence transliterations) vary from manuscript to manuscript. ' may thus also appear as ' or ' or ' (and variants). Originally and etymologically, ' means \\"mortal being\\" as Old Persian martya, Persian mard and even Sanskrit martya also mean \\"mortal\\" and therefore \\"man\\". The root in Avesta and Sanskrit for death is mar, mr, \\"to die\\". The causative m√¢r means \\"to kill\\". Its derivatives merethyu/mrtyu means \\"death\\"; mareta and maretan means \\"mortal\\", and then \\"man, human being\\" mashya. For more on the etymology of the a≈°a and arta variants of these terms, see Avestan phonology. Attestations According to the creation myth as described in the Bundahishn, Ohrmuzd's (Ahura Mazda) sixth creation is the primeval beast Gayomart (Gayamar…ôtan), who was neither male nor female. Ahriman (Angra Mainyu), the Spirit of Evil that dwelt in the Absolute Darkness, sought to destroy all that Ohrmuzd had created, and sent the demoness Jeh (Jahi) to kill Gayomard. In this she was successful, but the moon (Mah) captured his seed before the animal died, from which all animal life then grew. From Gayomard's corpse grew a tree, the seeds of which were the origin of all plant life, and from the branches of which grew Mashya and Mashyana. They promised to aid Ohrmuzd in his battle with Ahriman, and gave birth to fifteen sets of twins which scattered around the Earth and became the races of mankind. Theories Indo-European connections to Ask and Embla have been proposed. In Norse mythology, Ask and Embla were the first man and woman, created from trees and given various gifts of life by three gods. According to Benjamin Thorpe \\"Grimm says the word embla, emla, signifies a busy woman, from amr, ambr, aml, ambl, assidous labour; the same relation as Meshia and Meshiane, the ancient Persian names of the first man and woman, who were also formed from trees.\\"Thorpe (1907:337).

Johnson from 1964 to 1965. Life and career Born in East Chicago, Indiana, Reedy attended Senn High School in Chicago and graduated from the University of Chicago in 1938. Reedy was a reporter for United Press in Washington, D.C. before joining Johnson's Senate staff in 1951. He worked as an aide to Johnson during his presidential campaign in 1960, term as vice-president, and early months as President. When Pierre Salinger resigned as press secretary in March 1964, Reedy was named to the position. During the escalation of the American involvement in Vietnam beginning in March 1965, press questions over the veracity of the Johnson Administration's public assessments of the war led to charges of a so-called credibility gap. In 1965 Reedy took a leave of absence over his disagreement with Johnson's Vietnam policies. In 1968 he returned to the White House to work as a special assistant shortly before Johnson's surprise announcement that he would not seek reelection. After Johnson left office, Reedy started a supplementary newspaper serving South America and published The Twilight of the Presidency in 1970. The book was a critical and influential look at the modern American presidency and, in particular, at the impact that war has had on the office. While the book was not specifically critical of Johnson, the former president was reportedly unhappy with its frank assessment of the presidency and refused to speak with Reedy ever again. Early in his post- Watergate presidency, Gerald Ford asked his White House staff to read it.John Dean's essay on The Twilight of the Presidency In 1972 Reedy accepted an appointment as professor and dean of the journalism school at Marquette University. Reedy resigned as dean in 1976, but continued as Lucius W. Nieman Professor of Journalism (1977-1990) and Professor Emeritus (1991-1996). Reedy was married to fellow journalist Lillian Greenwald from 1948 until her death in 1984. He was married to Ruth Wissman from 1988 until his death in Milwaukee in 1999.

It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1960, for its central role in the city's history, and as the site where in 1803 Louisiana was made United States territory pursuant to the Louisiana Purchase. In 2012 the American Planning Association designated Jackson Square as one of the Great Public Spaces in the United States. Design and development Jackson Square was designed after the famous 17th- century Place des Vosges in Paris, France, by the architect and landscape architect Louis H. Pili√©. Jackson Square is roughly the size of a city block (GPS +29.95748 -090.06310). Sculptor Clark Mills' equestrian statue of Andrew Jackson (a recasting of the Washington, D.C., statue), hero of the Battle of New Orleans and seventh U.S. President for whom the former military parade ground was named, was erected in 1856. Iron fences, walkways, benches, and Parisian-style landscaping remain intact from the original design by Micaela Almonester, Baroness de Pontalba, in 1851. She also built the Pontalba Buildings, which flank the old square. The flagpole, symbolizing the 1803 ceremonial transfers from Spain to France and then from France to the United States, reflects Louisiana's rich colonial history. During the 1930s, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) repainted fa√ßades, renovated buildings, and improved landscaping in and around the park. In 1971, the pedestrian zone in the vicinity of Jackson Square was created, when three surrounding streets were closed to vehicular traffic ‚Äî Chartres, St. Peter, and St. Ann. History Jackson Square, 1815 Chartres Street side of the square, 1842, before the cathedral's remodeling and before the Pontalba Buildings. Jackson Square, 1885 Early French colonial New Orleans was centered on what was then called the ' (). Under Spanish colonial administration in the second half of the 18th century, the name was ', which also means a . Following the Great New Orleans Fire of 1788, the Spanish officials rebuilt the St. Louis Church (elevated to cathedral in 1793) in 1789 and the town hall (known as the Cabildo) in 1795. Following the 1815 Battle of New Orleans, during the first half of the 19th century, the former military plaza was renamed Jackson Square, for the battle's victorious General Jackson. In the center of the park stands an equestrian statue of Andrew Jackson erected in 1856, one of four identical statues in the U.S. by the sculptor Clark Mills. The statue was dedicated in a grand ceremony on Saturday, February 9, 1856. The square also has 4 slightly older statues, neoclassical representations of personifications of the 4 Seasons, one near each corner of the square. The square originally overlooked the Mississippi River across Decatur Street, but the view was blocked in the 19th century by the construction of higher levees. The riverfront was long devoted to shipping docks. The 20th-century administration of Mayor Moon Landrieu installed a scenic boardwalk on top of the levee to reconnect the city to the river; it is known as the \\"Moon Walk\\" in his honor, and has since been expanded and paved. The space between Decatur Street and the \\"Moon Walk\\" is designated as \\"Washington Artillery Park\\". On the north side of the square are three 18th-century historic buildings, which were the city's heart in the colonial era. The center of the three is St. Louis Cathedral. The cathedral was designated as a minor Basilica by Pope Paul VI. To its left is the Cabildo, the old city hall, now a museum, where the final version of the Louisiana Purchase was signed. To the cathedral's right is the Presbyt√®re, built to match the Cabildo. The Presbyt√®re was initially planned for housing the city's Roman Catholic priests and other church officials. At the start of the 19th century, it was adapted as a courthouse, and in the 20th century it became a museum. The Place d'Armes was the site for public execution of criminals and rebellious slaves during the 18th and early 19th centuries. After the 1811 German Coast Uprising, three slaves were hanged here. The heads of some of the executed rebels were put on the city's gates.See http://louisdl.louislibraries.org/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/lapur&CISOPTR;=712&REC;=16 , http://louisdl.louislibraries.org/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/lapur&CISOPTR;=6008&REC;=15 , and http://louisdl.louislibraries.org/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/lapur&CISOPTR;=720&REC;=4 (The same thing happened in St. Charles Parish, and a third slave-trial tribunal was held in St. John the Baptist Parish.) In the Reconstruction Era, Jackson Square served as an arsenal. During the insurrection following the disputed 1872 gubernatorial election, in March 1873, it was the site of the Battle of Jackson Square. A several-thousand-man militia under John McEnery, the Democratic claimant to the office of the Governor, defeated the New Orleans militia, seizing control of the state's buildings and armory for a few days. They retreated before the arrival of Federal forces, which temporarily re-established order. Artists, musicians, and New Age Portrait photograph of a local resident, taken in Jackson Square by Ben Shahn in 1935. From the 1920s through the 1980s the square was famous as a gathering place of painters of widely varying talents, including proficient professionals, talented young art students, amateurs, and caricaturists. The 1960s and 1970s saw the beginnings of the Square as a place of business for New Age and pagan devotees telling fortunes and reading palms and tarot cards. They sit on St. Ann or St. Peter street, alongside of the park. The section of Chartres St. which comprises the parvis of Saint Louis Cathedral, the Presbyt√®re, and the Cabildo is shared by visitors and artists, musicians, and varied street performers, such as jugglers and magicians. The performers generally work for tips. Points of interest and events Mardi Gras revelers in Jackson Square, 1989 On the other two sides of the square are the Pontalba Buildings, matching red- brick, block-long, 4‚Äëstory buildings built in the 1840s. The ground floors house shops and restaurants; the upper floors are apartments, the oldest continuously-rented apartments in North America. Diagonally across Decatur Street upriver from Jackson Square is the Jax Brewery building, the original home of a favorite local beer. After the company ceased to operate independently, the building was converted into several businesses, including restaurants and specialty shops. In recent years, some retail space has been converted into luxury condominiums. Diagonally across Decatur Street downriver from the square is Caf√© du Monde, open 24 hours a day. Part of the historic French Market, it is known for its caf√© au lait, prepared with chicory, and for its beignets, served there continuously since the Civil War days. Jackson Square has been the site of hundreds of live music events. Every year, the square hosts the French Quarter Festival and Caroling in Jackson Square. Occasionally, formal concerts are given in the park. Representation in media The square in 2012 Jackson Square has been filmed in numerous television shows and movies. Among these are the films Angel Heart, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, King Creole, and television series K-Ville, Treme, Memphis Beat and The Originals. It is the setting of an early scene in the graphic novel Polly and the Pirates by Ted Naifeh. In the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode \\"Image in the Sand\\", Joseph Sisko (Brock Peters) reveals that he met his first wife Sarah (Deborah Lacey) in Jackson Square. Jackson Square is one of the most important locations that can be visited in the computer game Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers. The park is a crucial site, with much of the game's action focusing on it and a number of characters making their appearance there. In the 2017 novel Poisoned Tears, by Honduran author J. H. Bogr√°n, one of the victims of the novel's serial killer is found in Jackson Square. On Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve '17 with Ryan Seacrest, Jackson Square rings in the new year for the first time during the broadcast with the Fleur-de-lis drop at midnight Central Time (1:00 a.m. ET in New York's Times Square).

It is the longest state highway in that region, and the only other one besides NY 14 to completely transect the state from the Pennsylvania state line to the shore of Lake Ontario. It continues south into Pennsylvania as Pennsylvania Route 449 (PA 449) and ends at an intersection with the Lake Ontario State Parkway just south of the lakeshore in Hamlin. NY 19 does not serve any major cities or metropolitan areas and remains a two- lane rural road for almost its entire length. However, it follows the Genesee River for much of its lower length, and offers easy access to the gorges of Letchworth State Park midway along its route. Most of modern NY 19 between Wellsville and Le Roy was originally designated as part of a legislative route in 1908. Much of this stretch was included in Route 16, an unsigned highway that initially extended from Cuba to Le Roy via Belfast. In 1921, Route 16 was altered to follow the path of what is now NY 19A instead. The first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, at which time the Wellsville‚ÄìBelvidere segment of modern NY 19 was designated as part of NY 17 and a small portion of NY 19 in Brockport became part of NY 3\\\\. Within two years, the pre-1921 routing of legislative Route 16 from Belfast to Pavilion was designated as part of New York State Route 62, a new route that began at Belvidere and passed through Pavilion before following modern NY 63 northwest to the Lake Ontario shoreline north of Lyndonville. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY 17 was altered to follow a more southerly routing between Olean and Wellsville while NY 62 became the basis for NY 19, which continued south of Belvidere to the Pennsylvania state line. The portion of what is now NY 19 north of Pavilion was initially part of NY 63; the alignments of NY 19 and NY 63 were flipped north of Pavilion . Only minor realignments and maintenance transfers have occurred since. Route description Allegany County accounts for about a third of NY 19's total length, with the other three counties splitting the rest about equally. =Allegany County= PA 449 becomes NY 19 just north of Genesee, Pennsylvania, as it runs along the Genesee River through a narrow valley. Just south of the first New York community it encounters, the hamlet of Shongo in the Town of Willing, it crosses the river. Running a little farther from the waterway, NY 19 reaches another hamlet, Stannards, several miles (kilometers) farther north, along with its first state highway junction, NY 248, which leaves to the east. NY 19 southbound at NY 248 in Stannards After Stannards, NY 19 crosses Chenunda Creek as the Genesee Valley widens somewhat, and continues north to the village of Wellsville, the largest community in Allegany County. It merges with NY 417, the east-west former route of NY 17 through the village, following a four-lane arterial along the Genesee River, which here runs through a concrete-lined flood control channel. North of Wellsville, the NY 19 corridor remains fairly well-developed as the highway makes its way to the smaller village of Belmont, the county seat. Here NY 19 crosses the Genesee River for the last time, and NY 244 leaves for Alfred to the east at the village center. past Belmont, NY 19 has its only direct freeway interchange, with the Southern Tier Expressway (Interstate 86 or I-86 and NY 17). Beyond it, it follows the river closely through the hamlet of Belfast, where NY 305 terminates. The next junction with another state highway, NY 243, comes at Caneadea, the next hamlet. It continues northward, passing through Houghton, home to Houghton College. NY 19A splits off in Fillmore to continue the riverside course and provide access to Letchworth State Park, while NY 19 climbs out of the valley and out of Allegany County. =Wyoming County= NY 19 north and NY 39 east in Pike After the short bend where it crosses the Wyoming County line, NY 19 bends slightly to the west as it comes into the hamlet of Pike to the north. The hamlet itself does not present any major intersections; however, NY 19 meets NY 39, the main east- west road across southern Wyoming County, northeast of the hamlet. The two routes overlap for just over before NY 19 turns back to the north and heads across mostly open fields to the next village, Gainesville, a few miles (kilometers) farther on. Again the intersecting state highway is displaced to the north of the village, where NY 78 heads off to the west despite being signed as a north‚Äìsouth route. NY 19 through Warsaw The route heads northeast from Gainesville to the hamlet of Rock Glen outside of Silver Springs, where NY 19A returns to its parent route and NY 19 passes under the Norfolk Southern Railway-owned Southern Tier Line. A few miles (kilometers) farther on, NY 19 reaches another county seat, Warsaw. The highway, along with the intersecting U.S. Route 20A (US 20A), serves as one of the village's two commercial axes. Upon leaving Warsaw to the north, NY 19, having trended slightly to the west since the state line, reaches its apex and begins to go slightly to the northeast for the remainder of the route. It begins this new course while running through the Wyoming Valley, formed by Oatka Creek, a tributary of the Genesee River. At the Middlebury‚ÄìCovington town line, NY 19 takes a sudden right turn from its route to follow Schwytzer‚ÄìEast Bethany Road for to Silver Lake Road, where it once again assumes a due north heading as it begins to parallel the Rochester and Southern Railroad and enters Genesee County. =Genesee and Monroe counties= Almost immediately after the county line NY 19 intersects NY 63 at a traffic light in the hamlet of Pavilion. The similarly named but smaller Pavilion Center to the north marks the junction‚Äîa pseudo-parclo interchange‚Äîwith US 20NY 19 at the US 20 interchange. NY 19 follows the Rochester and Southern Railroad into the village of Le Roy, where NY 19 intersects the state's other major east-west route, NY 5, and crosses the railroad as it turns eastward to access Caledonia. Outside of Le Roy, the route begins to leave Oatka Creek behind as the river and the route both descend the Onondaga Escarpment. Shortly afterwards, it crosses the I-90 segment of the New York State Thruway just west of where I-490 leaves the Thruway. While NY 19 is signed for this exit along the Thruway, access to it comes via the first exit on I-490, which is accessed via connector roads as the two highways do not directly intersect. alt=A wide street with a double yellow line and buildings on either side, more on the left than the right. American flags are on the lampposts, and signs both on the road and next to it indicate the railroad crossing in the distance. North of the Thruway, NY 19 enters the village of Bergen, intersecting NY 33 south of the village and NY 262 in the community itself. After passing the historic buildings of Lake Street, it crosses the CSX Transportation-owned Rochester Subdivision before exiting the village limits. Several miles (kilometers) later, after passing the Bergen Swamp Wildlife Refuge and crossing over Black Creek, it crosses its last county line, entering the rural southwestern corner of Monroe County. The route heads north through the lightly populated town of Sweden to a large commercial district located a short distance south of the southern boundary of Brockport, the largest community on NY 19's entire length. Here, NY 19, named South Lake Road, intersects NY 31, which enters from the west as Fourth Section Road and leaves to the east as Brockport‚ÄìSpencerport Road. NY 19 continues north into Brockport, where the road crosses the Erie Canal and passes SUNY Brockport and the Morgan-Manning House as Main Street. Less than northeast of the village, NY 19 reaches NY 104 (Ridge Road) at the hamlet of Clarkson Corners. Now known as North Lake Road, and eventually just Lake Road, NY 19 assumes a straight course again through the several miles (kilometers) of open country to its next junction, NY 18 at Hamlin. Just north of the quiet hamlet, Lake Road splits into east and west branches at a fork in the road. While unsigned CR 234 (former NY 360) branches off to the northwest on the west fork, NY 19 takes the east fork and heads northeast from the hamlet. A few miles (kilometers) more brings the route to North Hamlin and finally its northern terminus at the Lake Ontario State Parkway. Lake Road East Fork, at this point no longer part of NY 19, continues across the parkway to serve two Lake Ontario beach communities. History In 1908, the New York State Legislature established a statewide legislative route system that initially consisted of 37 unsigned routes. The system included three segments of what is now NY 19, two of which were located south of Le Roy. The longest of the three pieces extended from modern NY 305 in Belfast to NY 5 in Le Roy and comprised most of Route 16, which also continued southwest along current NY 305 to Cuba. Two smaller segments, from the southeastern end of the overlap with current NY 417 in Wellsville to County Route 20 (CR 20) in Belvidere and from what is now NY 31 south of Brockport to West Avenue in the village, became part of Route 4 and Route 30, respectively. On March 1, 1921, several routes were added, removed, or modified as part of a partial renumbering of New York's legislative route system. The portion of Route 30 between Medina and Rochester became part of an extended Route 20 while Route 16 was realigned to follow modern NY 19A between Fillmore and Gainesville. Lastly, the portion of modern NY 19 between NY 417 and NY 248 at Stannards was included in the new Route 46. Approaching the north end of NY 19 at the Lake Ontario State Parkway in Hamlin When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, the pieces of Route 4 between Belvidere and Wellsville and Route 20 along Main Street in Brockport were designated as part of NY 17 and NY 3, respectively. By 1926, the pre-1921 routing of Route 16 between Belfast and Pavilion was designated as part of NY 62, a route that continued south along modern NY 19 to Belvidere and northwest to the Lake Ontario shoreline by way of what is now NY 63. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY 17 was realigned between Olean and Wellsville to follow a new, more southerly routing while NY 62 became part of NY 19, a new route that extended from the Pennsylvania state line to Lake Ontario by way of former NY 62, NY 17's former routing from Wellsville to Belvidere, the segment of legislative Route 46 north of Stannards, and a previously unnumbered highway between Stannards and the Pennsylvania border. At the same time, the portion of legislative Route 16 between Pavilion and Le Roy became part of NY 63, which extended north to the lakeshore in Hamlin by way of what is now NY 19.Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book, 1930‚Äì31 and 1931‚Äì32 editions, (Scarborough Motor Guide Co., Boston, 1930 and 1931). The 1930‚Äì31 edition shows New York state routes prior to the 1930 renumbering The alignments of NY 19 and NY 63 north of Pavilion were flipped . Within the village of Wellsville, NY 19 and NY 417 (formerly NY 17) were originally routed on North and South Main streets. In the early 1970s, construction began on an arterial bypassing downtown Wellsville to the west. It was opened to traffic as part of a realigned NY 19 and NY 417 in October 1977. In Hamlin, the segment of NY 19 between North Hamlin Road and the Lake Ontario State Parkway was originally maintained by Monroe County as the unsigned CR 232. In 2007, ownership and maintenance of that segment of NY 19 was transferred from Monroe County to the state of New York as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. A bill (S4856, 2007) to enact the swap was introduced in the New York State Senate on April 23 and passed by both the Senate and the New York State Assembly on June 20\\\\. The act was signed into law by Governor Eliot Spitzer on August 28\\\\. Under the terms of the act, it took effect 90 days after it was signed into law; thus, the maintenance swap officially took place on November 26, 2007. NY 19A right NY 19A () is a western alternate to NY 19 between Fillmore and Rock Glen, connecting to Silver Springs, Castile and Portageville. It was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. NY 19 Truck NY 19 has had two short truck routes, one in the village of Belmont and another circumventing the village of Brockport. =Brockport= NY 19 Truck in Brockport is a route that serves as a bypass around a low bridge carrying the Falls Road Railroad over NY 19 in the village. It begins at the intersection of NY 31 and NY 19 south of Brockport and follows NY 31 westward on Fourth Section Road and northward on Redman Road to West Avenue. At West Avenue, NY 19 Truck splits from NY 31 and travels east on West Avenue to rejoin NY 19 north of the village. The West Avenue leg of NY 19 Truck was originally designated as part of NY 31\\\\. In the early 1980s, NY 31 was rerouted to bypass Brockport on Redman and Fourth Section roads. West Avenue was redesignated as NY 943B, an unsigned reference route. In 2007, ownership and maintenance of NY 943B was transferred from the state of New York to Monroe County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. A bill (S4856, 2007) to enact the swap was introduced in the New York State Senate on April 23 and passed by both the Senate and the New York State Assembly on June 20\\\\. The act was signed into law by Governor Eliot Spitzer on August 28\\\\. Under the terms of the act, it took effect 90 days after it was signed into law; thus, the maintenance swap officially took place on November 26, 2007. The former routing of NY 943B is now designated as the unsigned CR 281. The designations were obtained by using the Identify tool. =Belmont= NY 19 Truck in Belmont was a route that served as bypass around a bridge over the Genesee River on NY 19\\\\. The route began at the junction of Willetts Avenue (NY 19) and Genesee Street (NY 244) and followed Genesee Street northeastward across the Genesee River to Greenwich Street in the northern portion of the village. Here, NY 19 Truck split from NY 244 and turned southeastward, following Greenwich Street back to NY 19 east of the village center. The bypassed bridge was originally built in 1935 and had an operating rating of and a sufficiency rating of 3%. In late 2008, work began on a new bridge to replace the existing structure on NY 19\\\\. The new bridge cost $4.5 million and was opened to traffic on October 22, 2009. Signage for NY 19 Truck was removed following the completion of the project.

Biography  Born in 1932 in East Tennessee of Albanian parents, Kovach planned after attending college at East Tennessee State University to go to graduate school in marine biology. After four years in the U.S. Navy, a summer job at the Johnson City Press Chronicle in Johnson City, Tennessee persuaded him to go into journalism. Kovach covered the civil rights movement, politics and Appalachian poverty for the Nashville Tennessean from 1960 to 1967. In 1965, he was involved in a fight for public access to the legislature, when he refused to leave a committee hearing following a call for executive session. The state senate passed a resolution revoking his floor privileges. The Tennessean and editor John Seigenthaler, Sr. led a successful fight to open the legislative chambers. After Kovach spent a year at Stanford University on a journalism fellowship, Scotty Reston of The New York Times Washington bureau hired Kovach in 1968, and Kovach spent 18 years there, including serving as its Washington bureau chief. After a tempestuous two-year tenure as editor of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, when his staff won two Pulitzer Prizes and were finalists for several others, Kovach moved on to Harvard University in 1989 as a fellow, then curator, of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism. He retired from Harvard in 2001 and returned to Washington, where he is senior counselor to the Project for Excellence in Journalism. Kovach is the North American representative and chair of the ICIJ (International Consortium of Investigative Journalists) Advisory Committee. He also serves on the faculty of the Missouri School of Journalism.  Awards  In 2000, Kovach received the Elijah Parish Lovejoy Award as well as an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Colby College.

Early biography Raffman was born in New Bedford, Massachusetts, in 1921. He entered Dartmouth College in 1939, by which time he had been performing as a jazz pianist for several years. At Dartmouth, he was pianist, arranger, leader, singer, and saxophonist of the Barbary Coast Orchestra. His Dartmouth education was interrupted by four years in the U.S. Navy in World War II, during which he had a distinguished career as a carrier pilot, flying more than 75 missions and receiving the Distinguished Flying Cross and three Air Medals. Jazz performance After receiving his Dartmouth B.A. in 1947, he formed the Relly Raffman Trio and was active in the lively jazz scene of the southeastern Massachusetts area. His jazz activities expanded to New York City while he was at Columbia University earning his Master's Degree. Recording by the Barbary Coast Orchestra of Dartmouth College, featuring Relly Raffman Compositional study When, in 1950, Raffman arrived at Indiana University to begin work on a Ph.D. in theory and composition with Bernard Heiden, he was doing a complete flip-flop, as he later described it, from jazz to \\"serious\\" music. However, it was a flip-flop that integrated jazz into the serious music he would write; and, as described below, Raffman continued playing and writing jazz in later years, even as he delved into other areas of composition. Raffman also studied with John Cage during this period. Academic career Raffman's career was interrupted by military service a second time, during the Korean War. After serving three years as a flight instructor, Raffman returned to civilian life and joined the faculty at Clark University (Worcester, Massachusetts) in 1954, established the Music Department, and served as its first chair. From 1972-1977, he was the chairman of both the Music Department and of the newly created Department of Visual and Performing Arts. In 1966 he had been named the first Jeppson Professor of Music, a position he held to the time of his death in 1988. In that capacity, he taught courses in music history and theory. His main interest was 20th-century music; in particular, that of Debussy, Ravel, Stravinsky, and Bart√≥k. In teaching theory, he placed particular emphasis on the concept of scalar control, as exemplified in the music of 20th-century classical and jazz composers. During his 34 years at Clark, in addition to teaching history and theory, he was, at various times, conductor of the Chorus and the Madrigal Group, and he conducted several opera performances. In 1971, he inaugurated the Jazz Studies program and organized the Jazz Workshop, writing many big-band arrangements for the group. Raffman's arrangements were tailored to the strengths of the individual musicians in the band, which was composed of Clark students and outside musicians from the Worcester area. The works included original jazz compositions and arrangements of the work of other songwriters. In addition, Raffman wrote arrangements for a vocal group that sang with the Jazz Workshop; this group was generally made up of four singers but sometimes grew to as many as 12, when they were known as \\"the Dodecaphonics.\\" Compositional output Relly Raffman had fourteen published compositions and thirteen in manuscript; among the latter are a cantata, a musical, a one-act opera, \\"Midas,\\" which parodied President Lyndon Johnson, and chamber music for various combination. His last commission, \\"Fur Eliot,\\" was dedicated to guitarist Eliot Fisk, who worked closely with the composer in adapting the work to the guitar. Raffman had written the music in piano notation and in a register appropriate for the piano but with the intention that it be played on the guitar. Fisk made a number of suggestions \\"that turned it into a true guitar piece,\\" as he explained. Fisk has made two recordings of the work. References Clark University.

The southern terminus of the route is at an intersection with NY 98 north of the village of Albion in the town of Gaines. Its northern terminus is at a junction with NY 18 in Carlton near where NY 18 meets the western end of the Lake Ontario State Parkway. The entirety of NY 279 north of NY 104 is maintained by Orleans County; south of NY 104, the route is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation. NY 279 is a rural connector highway that serves only one community, the hamlet of Waterport on the banks of Oak Orchard Creek in Carlton. The origins of NY 279 date back to the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York when all of modern NY 279 was designated as part of New York State Route 209, which continued south through Albion and west through West Barre to Shelby. NY 209 was cut back to West Barre and renumbered to NY 279 in April 1935 to eliminate numerical duplication with U.S. Route 209, which was extended into New York at that time. NY 279 was truncated to its current southern terminus north of Albion in the early 1950s. NY 98, which originally followed Oak Orchard Road through Barre, was realigned to follow the easternmost segment of NY 279's former routing on Quaker Hill Road. Route description NY 279 crossing the Oak Orchard River, with Waterport in the background NY 279 begins at NY 98 just north of the village of Albion at the hamlet of Five Corners. The route heads northwest as Gaines Road through the town of Gaines to the hamlet of the same name, where it intersects NY 104 (Ridge Road). Here, maintenance of the route shifts from the New York State Department of Transportation to Orleans County. NY 279 continues on, now concurrent with the unsigned County Route 101, into the town of Carlton, where NY 279's county route designation becomes CR 102 upon crossing the Gaines‚ÄìCarlton town line. In Carlton, NY 279 deviates from its northwesterly routing and heads due west to serve the hamlet of Waterport situated on the Oak Orchard River. It intersects Eagle Harbor‚ÄìWaterport Road (CR 31) south of the community, then turns north toward the creek, becoming overlapped with CR 103 at CR 31\\\\. NY 279 heads through Waterport and crosses the river at Waterport Pond (also known as Lake Alice), a widewaters formed by a dam along Oak Orchard River northeast of Waterport. On the northern bank of the pond, NY 279 meets Oak Orchard River Road (CR 49). The CR 103 designation ends here and is replaced with CR 104 as NY 279 turns eastward onto Waterport Road. NY 279 south from NY 18 in Carlton The route briefly follows the northern bank of the river, then veers north to serve Waterport Station, a small community centered around the former grade crossing between NY 279 and the Hojack Line. Past Waterport Station, NY 279 continues north through forested areas and cultivated fields to its northern terminus at a junction with NY 18 near the Lake Ontario shoreline and south of Lakeside Beach State Park. Just east of the junction, NY 18 intersects the western end of the Lake Ontario State Parkway. History All of modern NY 279 was originally designated as part of NY 209, a route assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. NY 209 began at NY 19 (now NY 63) in Shelby and followed Fletcher Chapel, Hemlock Ridge, and West Barre Roads to Quaker Hill Road, where it turned north to meet NY 98 at Oak Orchard Road. The two routes then embarked on an overlap through Albion to Gaines Road, at which point NY 209 split off to the northwest toward the hamlet of Waterport. NY 209 was truncated eastward to West Barre . When U.S. Route 209 was extended into New York , NY 209 was renumbered to NY 279 to eliminate numerical duplication with the new U.S. Highway. In the early 1950s, NY 279 was cut back to its junction with NY 98 north of Albion. At the same time, NY 98 was realigned in Barre to use NY 279's former routing along Quaker Hill Road. The shift was part of a larger realignment of NY 98 through the towns of Barre and Elba. The remainder of NY 279's former routing to West Barre is now maintained by Orleans County as County Route 99.

Keyumars or Kiomars () was the name of the first king (shah) of the Pishdadian dynasty of Iran according to the Shahnameh. The name appears in Avestan in the form of ê¨îê¨Äê¨åê¨åê¨ä ê¨®ê¨Üê¨≠ê¨Üê¨ôê¨Äê¨• Gaiio M…ôr…ôtan, or in medieval Zoroastrian texts as Gay≈çmard or Gay≈çmart. In the Avesta he is the mythological first human being in the world. The corresponding name in Middle Persian is ê≠™ê≠£ê≠¨ê≠´ê≠≤ Kay≈çmart. In Ferdowsi's Shahnameh he appears as the first shah of the world. He is also called the pi≈°dƒÅd (), the first to practice justice, the lawgiver. The Avestan form means \\"the living mortal\\", from gaya \\"life\\" and mar…ôtan \\"mortal, human being\\"; cf. Persian mard \\"human\\" (). Keyumars is also a popular first name in Persian speaking countries (Iran, Afghanistan and Tajikistan). In Zoroastrian literature According to the Zoroastrian creation myth, Gay≈çmart was the first human, or, according to the Avesta, he was the first person to worship Ahura Mazda. The Avestan forms Mashya and Mashyana appear as the male and female first humans; their names are versions of the word mar…ôtan \\"mortal\\". In the eighth book of the Denkard, a reference is made to the ChethrdƒÅt section of the Avesta, which is divided into 21 sections. Apparently this section dealt with how the world and mankind were created, including the creation of Gay≈çmart. References are also made to the VarshtmƒÅnsar section, which also included information about Gay≈çmart which Ahura Mazda had given to Zoroaster: \\"For 30 centuries I kept the world from corruption and decay, when the 30th century came to an end the Dƒ´vs assaulted Gay≈çmart ... But I finally repelled them and plunged them into the darkness\\". A concise story of Gay≈çmart according to Middle Persian texts is given by Zabihollah Safa: In the Avesta, Gay≈çmart is named as the pure and righteous, and according to Zoroastrian tradition the genealogy of Zoroaster can be traced through 45 generations to him. In the Shahnameh Ferdowsi's great 11th century epic poem, the Shahnameh, begins with the story of Keyumars. He was the first king to arise among humans, who at that time lived in mountain caves and wore the skins of leopards. Keyumars was also the first human to introduce royal practices, preparation of food and the first practitioner of law and justice. He was so powerful that all humans, tame animals, and wild animals paid homage to him. God (Ahura Mazda) granted Keyumars the supernatural radiance called the farr (Avestan xvar…ônah), reserved for kings. His son was SiƒÅmak () was beloved of all except the Devil, Ahriman, who raised an army under the command of his own demonic son. When the angel Sorush (Avestan Srao≈°a) warned Keyumars, SiƒÅmak led an army of his own. SiƒÅmak accepted a challenge to single combat and died at the hands of the demon. Keyumars mourned for a year, and then Sorush advised him to fight Ahriman once more. SiƒÅmak's son Hushang (Avestan Hao≈°ya≈ãha) was grown by this time and led the army that defeated Ahriman's son, who was bound and beheaded. Keyumars died after a thirty-year reign, leaving his throne to Hushang. In the Meadows of Gold 10th century Muslim historian Ali Al-Masudi writes in his widely acclaimed historical book The Meadows of Gold and Mines of Gems that Keyumars was the son of Lud, son of Shem.

Education and early career Richard Henry Tudor Christophers was born in Goudhurst, Kent. He was a chorister at Canterbury Cathedral under choirmaster Allan Wicks, and later went to the King's School, Canterbury, where he played clarinet in the orchestra alongside Andrew Marriner. He has cited as his childhood musical influences the Rolling Stones, Brahms, Mahler, Stravinsky and Jethro Tull. Christophers became an academical clerk at Magdalen College, Oxford, studying classics for two years before beginning his musical career. He spent six years as a lay vicar at Westminster Abbey and then time as a member of the Clerkes of Oxenford and three years in the BBC Singers. Career with The Sixteen and the Handel and Haydn Society Christophers founded the vocal ensemble The Sixteen in 1979. He has directed The Sixteen and its orchestra throughout Europe, America and the Far East, becoming recognised for his work in Renaissance, Baroque and 20th-century music. With The Sixteen he has conducted recordings for CORO (The Sixteen's own label) and other labels including Hyperion Records, UCJ and Virgin Classics. Several recordings have received honours such as a Grand Prix du Disque and a Midem award for Handel's Messiah, numerous Schallplattenkritik, the Gramophone Award for Early Music and the Classical Brit Award 2005 for the disc Renaissance. The Sixteen's 2009 recording of Handel's Coronation Anthems earned a Classic FM Gramophone Award in the Baroque Vocal category as well as Artist of the Year honours for Christophers and The Sixteen. The recording also earned Christophers a Grammy nomination for Best Choral Performance. In 2000, Christophers began the \\"Choral Pilgrimage\\", a national tour of English cathedrals from York to Canterbury, in music from the pre-Reformation era as The Sixteen's contribution to the millennium celebrations. This then led to subsequent annual pilgrimages devised around particular themes. As part of The Sixteen's thirtieth anniversary in 2009, the ninth pilgrimage was dedicated to the anniversaries of Henry Purcell, James MacMillan and George Frideric Handel. The 2011 pilgrimage focused on the music of Tom√°s Luis de Victoria and the 2012 pilgrimage, entitled \\"The Earth Resounds\\", explores the sacred music of Flanders in the 15th and 16th centuries by composers Josquin, Brumel and Lassus. In September 2008, Christophers was named the Artistic Director of the Handel and Haydn Society in Boston, Massachusetts, beginning in the 2009‚Äì2010 season, for an initial contract of three seasons. In September 2011, his contract with the Handel and Haydn Society was extended another four seasons until the 2015‚Äì2016 season, in time for the organisation's bicentennial celebrations. Increasingly busy in opera, Christophers has conducted numerous productions for Lisbon Opera and English National Opera as well as conducting the UK premiere of Messager's opera Fortunio for Grange Park Opera. He is a regular conductor at Buxton Opera where he initiated a cycle of Handel's operas and oratorios including Semele, Samson and Saul. Christophers is an Honorary Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford, as well as the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama and has been awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Music from the University of Leicester. Christophers is also Patron of the Southwell Music Festival in Nottinghamshire. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2012 Birthday Honours for services to music.

More generally it is known as F-bound polymorphism, and it is a form of F-bounded quantification. History The technique was formalized in 1989 as \\"F-bounded quantification.\\" The name \\"CRTP\\" was independently coined by Jim Coplien in 1995, who had observed it in some of the earliest C++ template code as well as in code examples that Timothy Budd created in his multiparadigm language Leda. It is sometimes called \\"Upside- Down Inheritance\\" due to the way it allows class hierarchies to be extended by substituting different base classes. The Microsoft Implementation of CRTP in Active Template Library (ATL) was independently discovered, also in 1995, by Jan Falkin, who accidentally derived a base class from a derived class. Christian Beaumont first saw Jan's code and initially thought it couldn't possibly compile in the Microsoft compiler available at the time. Following the revelation that it did indeed work, Christian based the entire ATL and Windows Template Library (WTL) design on this mistake.  General form  // The Curiously Recurring Template Pattern (CRTP) template class Base { // methods within Base can use template to access members of Derived }; class Derived : public Base { // ... }; Some use cases for this pattern are static polymorphism and other metaprogramming techniques such as those described by Andrei Alexandrescu in Modern C++ Design. It also figures prominently in the C++ implementation of the Data, Context, and Interaction paradigm.  Static polymorphism  Typically, the base class template will take advantage of the fact that member function bodies (definitions) are not instantiated until long after their declarations, and will use members of the derived class within its own member functions, via the use of a cast; e.g.: template struct Base { void interface() { // ... static_cast(this)->implementation(); // ... } static void static_func() { // ... T::static_sub_func(); // ... } }; struct Derived : Base { void implementation(); static void static_sub_func(); }; In the above example, note in particular that the function Base::interface(), though declared before the existence of the struct Derived is known by the compiler (i.e., before Derived is declared), is not actually instantiated by the compiler until it is actually called by some later code which occurs after the declaration of Derived (not shown in the above example), so that at the time the function \\"implementation\\" is instantiated, the declaration of Derived::implementation() is known. This technique achieves a similar effect to the use of virtual functions, without the costs (and some flexibility) of dynamic polymorphism. This particular use of the CRTP has been called \\"simulated dynamic binding\\" by some. This pattern is used extensively in the Windows ATL and WTL libraries. To elaborate on the above example, consider a base class with no virtual functions. Whenever the base class calls another member function, it will always call its own base class functions. When we derive a class from this base class, we inherit all the member variables and member functions that weren't overridden (no constructors or destructors). If the derived class calls an inherited function which then calls another member function, that function will never call any derived or overridden member functions in the derived class. However, if base class member functions use CRTP for all member function calls, the overridden functions in the derived class will be selected at compile time. This effectively emulates the virtual function call system at compile time without the costs in size or function call overhead (VTBL structures, and method lookups, multiple-inheritance VTBL machinery) at the disadvantage of not being able to make this choice at runtime.  Object counter  The main purpose of an object counter is retrieving statistics of object creation and destruction for a given class. This can be easily solved using CRTP: template struct counter { static int objects_created; static int objects_alive; counter() { ++objects_created; ++objects_alive; } counter(const counter&) { ++objects_created; ++objects_alive; } protected: ~counter() // objects should never be removed through pointers of this type { \\\\--objects_alive; } }; template int counter::objects_created( 0 ); template int counter::objects_alive( 0 ); class X : counter { // ... }; class Y : counter { // ... }; Each time an object of class \`X\` is created, the constructor of \`counter\` is called, incrementing both the created and alive count. Each time an object of class \`X\` is destroyed, the alive count is decremented. It is important to note that \`counter\` and \`counter\` are two separate classes and this is why they will keep separate counts of \`X\`'s and \`Y\`'s. In this example of CRTP, this distinction of classes is the only use of the template parameter (\`T\` in \`counter\`) and the reason why we cannot use a simple un-templated base class.  Polymorphic chaining  Method chaining, also known as named parameter idiom, is a common syntax for invoking multiple method calls in object- oriented programming languages. Each method returns an object, allowing the calls to be chained together in a single statement without requiring variables to store the intermediate results. When the named parameter object pattern is applied to an object hierarchy, things can go wrong. Suppose we have such a base class: class Printer { public: Printer(ostream& pstream) : m_stream(pstream) {} template Printer& print(T&& t) { m_stream << t; return *this; } template Printer& println(T&& t) { m_stream << t << endl; return *this; } private: ostream& m_stream; }; Prints can be easily chained: Printer{myStream}.println(\\"hello\\").println(500); However, if we define the following derived class: class CoutPrinter : public Printer { public: CoutPrinter() : Printer(cout) {} CoutPrinter& SetConsoleColor(Color c) { // ... return *this; } }; we \\"lose\\" the concrete class as soon as we invoke a function of the base: // v----- we have a 'Printer' here, not a 'CoutPrinter' CoutPrinter().print(\\"Hello \\").SetConsoleColor(Color.red).println(\\"Printer!\\"); // compile error This happens because 'print' is a function of the base - 'Printer' - and then it returns a 'Printer' instance. The CRTP can be used to avoid such problem and to implement \\"Polymorphic chaining\\": Polymorphic copy construction When using polymorphism, one sometimes needs to create copies of objects by the base class pointer. A commonly used idiom for this is adding a virtual clone function that is defined in every derived class. The CRTP can be used to avoid having to duplicate that function or other similar functions in every derived class. // Base class has a pure virtual function for cloning class AbstractShape { public: virtual ~AbstractShape () = default; virtual std::unique_ptr clone() const = 0; }; // This CRTP class implements clone() for Derived template class Shape : public AbstractShape { public: std::unique_ptr clone() const override { return std::make_unique(static_cast(*this)); } protected: // We make clear Shape class needs to be inherited Shape() = default; Shape(const Shape&) = default; Shape(Shape&&) = default; }; // Every derived class inherits from CRTP class instead of abstract class class Square : public Shape{}; class Circle : public Shape{}; This allows obtaining copies of squares, circles or any other shapes by \`shapePtr->clone()\`. Pitfalls One issue with static polymorphism is that without using a general base class like \`AbstractShape\` from the above example, derived classes cannot be stored homogeneously--that is, putting different types derived from the same base class in the same container. For example, a container defined as \`std::vector\` does not work because \`Shape\` is not a class, but a template needing specialization. A container defined as \`std::vector*>\` can only store \`Circle\`s, not \`Square\`s. This is because each of the classes derived from the CRTP base class \`Shape\` is a unique type. A common solution to this problem is to inherit from a shared base class with a virtual destructor, like the \`AbstractShape\` example above, allowing for the creation of a \`std::vector\`.

Backstory Lucinda Walsh was born Mary Ellen Walters and her parents broke up not long after her birth. After living with her father for a number of years, she ran away to Montega, South America and married Jacobo Estaban and gave birth to a daughter, Sierra Esteban. After her marriage failed and she was banished from seeing Sierra again, Mary Ellen changed her name to Lucinda and remarried. Her new husband, Martin Guest, arranged for them to illegally adopt a daughter, whom they named Lily. When the truth came out about the method of Lily's adoption, Martin committed suicide. Lucinda tried marriage again with James Walsh, but he died shortly after their marriage. Storylines =1980s= Lucinda arrived in Oakdale and attempted to take over Whit McColl's newspaper, The Argus. Whit and Lucinda's former husband Martin Guest had been associates and she blamed him for her husband's suicide. This began a nearly two-decade long feud between Lucinda and Whit's then wife Lisa Grimaldi. Lucinda first attempted to keep her scandalous past a secret. It was only after a dangerous situation in Montega, involving Sierra Esteban and other Oakdale residents, that she revealed the fact that she was Sierra's mother. Her daughter Lily Walsh Snyder had believed that Lucinda was her biological mother for a long time, never knowing of her adoption. After Lily had fallen in love with stable boy Holden Snyder, Lily was shocked to find out that not only was she adopted, but that her mother was Holden's adopted sister, Iva Snyder. Lily and Lucinda remained at odds for years but eventually repaired their relationship. In 1987, following a spirited argument where both of them ended up fully clothed in her hot tub, Lucinda impulsively married her long-time rival Dr. John Dixon. Although they loved each other very much, Lucinda's scheming ways eventually proved to be more than John could handle, particularly after her insecurities led her to target his relationship with his newfound son Duke. They divorced in 1991, but remained close friends. Lucinda also had an attraction to Craig Montgomery, who romanced and married Sierra. Their attraction grew and culminated in a memorable kiss that Lily walked in on, leading to a near 25-year love-hate relationship. =1990s= Lucinda lost Walsh Enterprises to Connor Jamison, who turned out to be Connor Walsh, the long-lost granddaughter of James Walsh. Connor and her brother Evan orchestrated a takeover of Walsh Enterprises. Lucinda bounced back and created her own company, Worldwide Industries. Lucinda recalled her childhood and her complicated relationship with her mother, Gloria. She learned of Gloria's other children, her half brother Royce Keller and half sister Neal Alcott and Samantha Markham. Royce, who suffered from dissociative identity disorder, killed Neal before Lucinda could tell them the truth. Lucinda did, accept Samantha as her sister. After marrying and divorcing James Stenbeck she became a single woman yet again. =2000‚Äì2010= When Rose D'Angelo, Lily's twin sister who was also illegally adopted at birth, surfaced in Oakdale, Lucinda took her under her wing before her death. In 2005, Lucinda was diagnosed with breast cancer. She refused to let Sierra and Lily help and support her and didn't want to be away from Worldwide for too long, so she began to take trips to Mexico with Keith Morrissey, Lily's boyfriend, for experimental treatments. Lucinda's cancer soon went into remission and Lily left Keith, returning to her true love, Holden. Soon after, Lucinda was the main voice of reason when young drifter Jade Taylor came to town claiming to be Rose's daughter. Lucinda had a feeling that Jade was a fraud, and later on, that proved to be the truth. Since then, Lucinda has been involved in the life on Lily's son, Luke. She was concerned about Luke's alcoholism and was willing to support him in his decisions while still offering her own brand of tough love. When Luke told his family that he is gay, Lucinda happily accepted her grandson's confession and promised to completely support him. Soon after Luke's confession, his biological father Damian Grimaldi showed up with hopes of luring his son back to his home in Malta. Lucinda, from the very beginning, pegged Damian's intentions as nothing but detrimental to Luke's happiness and called him on it. Damian eventually left town after his schemes were unsuccessful. Lucinda began working with Katie Peretti on the publication of the novel Oakdale Confidential: Secrets Revealed, a book that was released that dispelled various secrets about the town. In mid-2008, Lucinda hired Brian Wheatley to run Luke's organization and Brian and Lucinda began dating.http://www.tvguide.com/soaps/Casting-Quickies-World-10028.aspx It was revealed that Lucinda was one of the people involved in helping Dusty Donovan fake his own death. This led to Lily saying that she wants nothing more to do with her. She was arrested on for being an accomplice in Dusty's fake death but soon released. Lucinda learned that her breast cancer returned and that she needed to start treatment immediately. After coming out of surgery, Lucinda proposed to Brian Wheatley and he accepted. They were then married. Soon after they married, during Lucinda's recovery, she noticed that Brain would not consummate their marriage. The night before their wedding, Brian kissed Lucinda's grandson Luke while Luke was drunk and he kissed him several more times, leading Luke's boyfriend to intervene. Lucinda found out about what had happened and divorced Brian, who admitted to her that he was a man struggling to come out as gay. In 2010, Lucinda reunited with her ex-husband, John Dixon. John attempted to help Lucinda reconcile with Lily again, but when the attempt failed, he invited her to accompany him to Amsterdam for a month. She accepted, and they fell in love again, vowing to spend the rest of their days having fun together. Reception Elizabeth Hubbard's character Lucinda Walsh is often described as a \\"savvy businesswoman\\" and a \\"cutthroat.\\" Her love for her daughters and attraction towards dangerous men often drove her to great lengths over the years. Many of Hubbard's co-stars praise her work and dedication to acting. In an interview with TV Guide, Scott Bryce, who played Craig Montgomery cited his appreciation for Hubbard and his dissatisfaction with the show for not exploring more story between the two actors. \\"That woman taught me how to do this genre. She's a remarkable actress and an even more remarkable person.

Hubbard joined the show following an offer from the producers after appearing on a local talk show. In an interview with Soap Opera Digest columnist Mala Bhattacharjee on June 8, 2009, Hubbard talked about her enjoyment of appearing on the show and the international fan base associated with ATWT. > \\"I think it's marvelous.

M. DeMatteis and illustrated by Jon J. Muth and Kent Williams as well as George Pratt. It was later released as a trade paperback currently entitled The Compleat Moonshadow. The comic was inspired by the Cat Stevens song of the same name.Moonshadow #1, DC Comics re-release, 1998, Interior notes It takes the form of a coming-of-age story with elements of satire. Plot The story takes the form of an eclectic and quirky fairy tale with satirical elements and dealing with philosophical concerns. It is told via the framing device of Moonshadow, now 120, looking back on his earlier life. The action concerns the events leading up to the \\"awakening\\" of Moonshadow, the child of a hippy mother and an enigmatic alien father. The alien, who resembles a glowing orb of light bearing a stylized human face, abducted Moonshadow's mother from Earth in 1968 along with her black pet cat, Frodo. When the idealistic and naive Moonshadow is orphaned at approximately age 15, he becomes friends with a venal and opportunistic furry humanoid named Ira. Moonshadow and Ira and Frodo the cat set out to find a life for themselves in the stars. Moonshadow loses his innocence, but eventually makes peace with the world and reconciles himself to the actions of his seemingly capricious alien father. Background and creation The general concept of Moonshadow dates back to roughly a decade before the series's publication, and was reworked by J.M. DeMatteis numerous times over the years. For example, in the original concept for the series, the protagonist had superpowers. Another early concept for the series, then under the title \\"Stardust\\", was submitted to Marvel Comics editor-in- chief Jim Shooter around the turn of the decade. Encouraged by the publication of experimental series such as Camelot 3000 and the Epic Comics lineup, in 1983 DeMatteis again pursued publication for Moonshadow. While talking with his friend Karen Berger, he mentioned his idea for the series, and an enthusiastic Berger offered to have DC Comics publish it. Having already been considering going over to DC, DeMatteis was initially inclined to accept. However, when he discussed the upcoming expiration of his contract with Marvel with Shooter, Shooter offered to publish both Moonshadow and the Greenberg the Vampire graphic novel, another DeMatteis pet project that he had previously rejected. DeMatteis recalled, Publication history Moonshadow was originally a twelve-issue maxi-series published by Marvel Comics under its Epic imprint from 1985 to 1987. It was the first American comic book whose art was done entirely by painting. The series was subsequently reprinted as a single volume in 1989. Also in 1989, a limited edition hardcover was also released by Graphitti Designs. Only 1200 copies of this edition were published, each individually numbered and signed by DeMatteis and Muth. From 1994 to 1995, DC Comics published the individual issues as one of the first limited series of its Vertigo imprint, followed in 1997 by Farewell, Moonshadow, a one-issue sequel set years later, which acts as a coda to the series. The Compleat Moonshadow reprinted all of this material in 1998 with some textual revisions. In 2019, Dark Horse Comics reprinted The Compleat Moonshadow in a single hardcover volume, with a new introduction by DeMatteis, behind-the-scenes material, and all the covers of the Epic and Vertigo series.

In most courts, hearsay evidence is inadmissible (the \\"Hearsay Evidence Rule\\") unless an exception to the Hearsay Rule applies. For example, to prove that Tom was in town, the attorney asks a witness, \\"What did Susan tell you about Tom being in town?\\" Since the witness's answer will rely on an out-of-court statement that Susan made, if Susan is unavailable for cross-examination, the answer is hearsay. A justification for the objection is that the person who made the statement is not in court and thus is insulated from cross-examination. Note, however, that if the attorney asking the same question is not trying to prove the truth of the assertion about Tom being in town but the fact that Susan said the specific words, it may be acceptable. For example, it would be acceptable to ask a witness what Susan told them about Tom in a defamation case against Susan because now the witness is asked about the opposing party's statement that constitutes a verbal act. The hearsay rule does not exclude the evidence if it is an operative fact. Language of commercial offer and acceptance is also admissible over a hearsay exception because the statements have independent legal significance. Double hearsay is a hearsay statement that contains another hearsay statement itself. For example, a witness wants to testify that \\"a very reliable man informed me that Wools-Sampson told him\\". The statements of the very reliable man and Wools-Sampson are both hearsay submissions on the part of the witness, and the second hearsay (the statement of Wools-Sampson) depends on the first (the statement of the very reliable man). In a court, both layers of hearsay must be found separately admissible. In this example, the first hearsay also comes from an anonymous source, and the admissibility of an anonymous statement depends upon the discharge of an additional legal burden of proof. Many jurisdictions that generally disallow hearsay evidence in courts permit the more widespread use of hearsay in non- judicial hearings. United States The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that \\"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him\\". \\"Hearsay is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\\"Federal Rules of Evidence, December 1st2009 Per Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(a), a statement made by a defendant is admissible as evidence only if it is inculpatory; exculpatory statements made to an investigator are hearsay and therefore may not be admitted as evidence in court, unless the defendant testifies. When an out-of-court statement offered as evidence contains another out-of-court statement it is called double hearsay, and both layers of hearsay must be found separately admissible. There are several exceptions to the rule against hearsay in U.S. law. Federal Rule of Evidence 803 lists the following: * Statement against interest * Present sense impressions and Excited utterances * Then existing mental, emotional, or physical condition * Medical diagnosis or treatment * Recorded recollection * Records of regularly conducted activity * Public records and reports, as well as absence of entry in records * Records of vital statistics * Absence of public record or entry * Records of religious organizations * Marriage, baptismal, and similar certificates, and Family and Property records * Statements in documents affecting an interest in property * Statements in ancient documents the authenticity of which can be established. * Market reports, commercial publications * Learned treatises * Reputation concerning personal or family history, boundaries, or general history, or as to character * Judgment of previous conviction, and as to personal, family or general history, or boundaries. Also, some documents are self-authenticating under Rule 902, such as (1) domestic public documents under seal, (2) domestic public documents not under seal, but bearing a signature of a public officer, (3) foreign public documents, (4) certified copies of public records, (5) official publications, (6) newspapers and periodicals, (7) trade inscriptions and the like, (8) acknowledged documents (i.e. by a notary public), (9) commercial paper and related documents, (10) presumptions under Acts of Congress, (11) certified domestic records of regularly conducted activity, (12) certified foreign records of regularly conducted activity. England and Wales In England and Wales, hearsay is generally admissible in civil proceedings,Civil Evidence Act 1995, . but is only admissible in criminal proceedings if it falls within a statutory or a preserved common law exception,The preserved common law exceptions are held in Criminal Justice Act 2003, s.118 all of the parties to the proceedings agree, or the court is satisfied that it is in the interests of justice that the evidence is admissible.Criminal Justice Act 2003, . Section 116 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 provides that, where a witness is unavailable, hearsay is admissible where a) the relevant person is dead; b) the relevant person is unfit to be a witness because of his bodily or mental condition; c) the relevant person is outside the UK and it is not reasonably practicable to secure his attendance; d) the relevant person cannot be found; e) through fear, the relevant person does not give oral evidence in the proceedings and the court gives leave for the statement to be given in evidence. The two main common law exceptions to the rule that hearsay is inadmissible are res gestae and confessions. Canada Hearsay evidence is generally inadmissible in Canada unless it falls within one of the established common law exceptions. As a result of the Supreme Court's decision in R. v. Khan and subsequent cases, hearsay evidence that does not fall within the established exceptions can be admitted where established that such evidence is both \\"necessary and reliable\\". Additionally, hearsay evidence that would otherwise be admissible as an exception can nonetheless be excluded if it is not necessary and reliable, as in R. v. Starr. Australia The rules of evidence differ among the states and the Commonwealth; the Commonwealth, Victoria, New South Wales, Tasmania, and the Australian Capital Territory all share similar hearsay provisions in their Uniform Evidence Acts; the other states rely upon the common law. As elsewhere, hearsay is usually inadmissible, outside of interlocutory proceedings, unless it falls within one of the hearsay exceptions. = Uniform Evidence Act = Hearsay is dealt with under Part 3¬∑2. There are several local peculiarities with its treatment. s 59 defines the 'fact' of a hearsay statement as being something 'that it can reasonably be supposed that the person intended to assert by the representation'. Hearsay rule confines the potentially broad number of assertions it might cover by this broad definition of representation to only intended representations adduced to prove existence of the asserted facts. In Lee v The Queen,. the term 'representation' was used to apply to statements and to conduct and was used to encompass all those statements or that conduct would convey to the observer. The extraordinary s 60 allows a statement's use as hearsay if it is admitted for a non-hearsay purpose, although the application of s 60 may be limited by s 137 (which is essentially the discretion formerly known as Christie.) s 72 excepts 'evidence of a representation about ... the traditional laws and customs of an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander group', although this arguably would have fallen into the 'public right' exception at common law. Confessions are called 'admissions' by the Act (which quite foreseeably led to the confusion whereby counsel apply for the 'admission of the admission'.) They are dealt with separately under Part 3¬∑4, which lifts the hearsay rule. The Act's dictionary defines 'admission' broadly enough to include anything that might be used against the accused. The other sections in the Part for the most part codify, roughly, the common-law rules.  Malaysia  In Malaysia, hearsay evidence is generally not allowed. However, the Evidence Act 1950 permitted a few exceptions, such as section 6, 73A, etc. New Zealand Hearsay evidence is covered by sections 16-22 of the Evidence Act 2006. Previously inadmissible, the 1989 decision of the Court of Appeal in R v Baker created a common law exception to the hearsay rule based on reliability, which was codified in the Evidence Act. Pursuant to s 4(1) of the Act, a hearsay statement is a statement made by someone other than a witness (in the proceedings) that is offered to prove the truth of its contents. Under section 17 of this Act a hearsay statement is generally not admissible in any court proceeding. Though section 18 states when a hearsay statement may be able to be given in court. This is when the statement is reliable, the statement maker is unavailable to be called as a witness or it would provide undue expense and delay if that person was required to be a witness. There are also a number of specific exceptions such as statements in business records. Other exceptions include state of mind evidence (see R v Blastland) and whether the statement is tendered to prove the fact it was uttered or made, rather than to prove the truth of its contents (see DPP v Subramaniam). Norway Even if Norway has a maxim of \\"free evidence\\" (any statement, object, forensics or other matters that may apply) to be entered and admitted in court, hearsay is in conflict with the defense counsel's or prosecution's ability to cross examine, as the witness who relayed the original statement is not present in court. In practice, hearsay is then not allowed.  Sri Lanka  In Sri Lanka, hearsay evidence is generally not allowed. However, the Evidence Ordinance recognizes a few exceptions such as res gestae (recognised under Section 6) and common intention (recognised under Section 10)and some other exceptions from section 17 to section 39. Some other exceptions are provided by case law (see Subramaniam v. DPP [1956] 1 WLR 956 (PC)).  Sweden  Sweden allows hearsay evidence. Sweden applies a principle of admissibility of evidence which means that there are very few restrictions on what evidence is allowed in court. It is then up to the court to evaluate the reliability of the evidence presented.European E-justice portal - Taking of evidence - Sweden Hong Kong In Hong Kong, hearsay is generally admissible in civil proceedings under the statutory regime. Section 46 of the Evidence Ordinance provides that evidence shall not be excluded on the ground that it is hearsay in civil proceedings unless: the party against whom the evidence is to be adduced objects to the admission of the evidence; as well as: the court is satisfied, having regard to the circumstances of the case, that the exclusion of the evidence is not prejudicial to the interests of justice. Sections 47A to 51 provides for safeguards in relation to hearsay evidence admissible under section 46 so as to avoid abuses of the general admission: *the obligation to give notice and particulars to other parties when proposing to adduce hearsay evidence (Section 47A); *the power to call witness for cross-examination on hearsay statement with the leave of the court (Section 48); *consideration relevant to weighing of hearsay evidence (Section 49); *competence and credibility (Section 50); and, *previous statement of witness (Section 51). The courts shall draw inferences from the circumstances as to the weight attached to hearsay evidence, in particular: *whether it would have been reasonable and practicable for the party by whom the evidence was adduced to have produced the maker of the original statement as a witness; *whether the original statement was made contemporaneously with the occurrence or existence of the matters stated; *whether the evidence involves multiple hearsay; *whether any person involved had any motive to conceal or misrepresent matters; *whether the original statement was an edited account, or was made in collaboration with another or for a particular purpose; *whether the circumstances in which the evidence is adduced as hearsay are such as to suggest an attempt to prevent proper evaluation of its weight; *whether or not the evidence adduced by the party is consistent with any evidence previously adduced by the party. The new civil regime also preserves a number of common law exceptions that are unaffected by the statutory safeguards except for the section 47A safeguard relating to notice. In criminal proceedings, the law relating to hearsay has not been substantially changed in Hong Kong, and the common law regime remains the rules followed by the Hong Kong criminal courts. Hearsay evidence is inadmissible in all criminal cases except for common law and statutory exemptions, which include: admissions and confessions, dying declarations, declarations in the course of duty, declarations against interest, co-conspirator's rule, statements in public documents, out-of-court statements, evidence in former proceedings, and Res gestae. Statutory exceptions in criminal cases include: negative assertions (s.17A Evidence Ordinance), bank records (ss.19B and 20 Evidence Ordinance), documentary records compiled by a person under a duty (s.22 Evidence Ordinance), computer records (s.22A Evidence Ordinance), and agreed written statements (s.65B Criminal Procedure Ordinance).

The college was named after Saint Madeleine Sophie Barat, founder of the Society of the Sacred Heart. Barat College was purchased by DePaul University in 2001, but closed in 2005; the faculty and student body were absorbed by DePaul, and the campus and educational inventory were sold.  History  Barat College began as an academy for young women in Chicago in 1858 and moved to its Lake Forest location in 1904. In 1918, the state of Illinois chartered Barat as a four- year college. In 1964 85 women graduated from the university. In 1982, Barat became a coeducational institution. To qualify for federal financial programs, governance of the college passed from the Society of the Sacred Heart to an independent Board of Trustees in 1969. In February 2001, because of fiscal concerns, Barat College was purchased by DePaul University, becoming one of DePaul's seven colleges. The college was then renamed Barat College of DePaul University. In February 2004, the DePaul University Trustee Board voted to discontinue operating Barat College despite a 14‚Äì11 vote by the DePaul Faculty Council to continue the alliance. DePaul then began to accept proposals for the future of the college, culminating in the proposal for a relationship with the American College of Education. Through its wholly owned Illinois subsidiary, they acquired a substantial portion of the educational business of Barat College, including the library materials, regional accreditation through the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association and permits and other authorizations from governmental authorities, education agencies, or other third parties. In 2006, the campus was sold to Lake Forest housing developer Robert G. Shaw (Barat Woods LLC), for development as condominium residences. Shaw declined to say what he paid for the Barat property but said it was \\"less than $20 million.\\" The courtyard and part of the Old Main building were to be preserved. However, the Thabor Wing, which was added to the building in 1924 and contained the Italianate style Sacred Heart Chapel, was to be demolished.Preservation Online: City OKs 1924 Chapel Demolition for Condos Shaw's development plans met resistance from a number of factions who favored building preservation, including the advocacy group Landmarks Illinois, which placed the property's Sacred Heart Chapel on the list of Illinois' Top 10 Endangered Places. Although Lake Forest's Historic Preservation Commission voted to save the chapel, in April 2007 the Lake Forest City Council approved its demolition. Before demolition could proceed, the property fell into foreclosure and was purchased in 2010 by Harris Bank. In August 2011, the Woodlands Academy of the Sacred Heart, a Catholic high school adjacent to the 23-acre Barat campus, announced that the land was being gifted to the Academy by anonymous donors. On December 12, 2012, the birthday of St. Madeleine Sophie Barat, who founded the Society of the Sacred Heart in 1800, the property transfer was completed. In 2013, the Old Main building was demolished, although the cupola from the building was removed, restored and in 2015, placed in an area on campus designated the \\"Barat Cupola Garden\\" and walking path.http://www.cityoflakeforest.com/assests/1/27/CC_2015_09_08.pdf Barat College housed the academic records of Duchesne College in Omaha, Nebraska. These records along with the academic records were transferred to the Society of the Sacred Heart. Individuals who attended Duchesne College (another Sacred Heart School) can ask for their transcripts through the Society of the Sacred Heart Archives, US Province in St. Louis Missouri. The Barat Education Foundation, an independent 501(c)(3) corporation, continues and advances the Barat legacy. Its website provides information of interest to Barat College alumni and friends of the foundation. A brief history of the college from 1904 to 2004 is included in the issue of Barat Magazine.Barat Magazine, Spring 2004 Barat College, in its heyday, thrived during a time of expansion for women's colleges. In the 1960s Barat College was part of seven schools of higher education run by the RSCJ. The Society of the Sacred Heart moved away from managing women's colleges in the 1970s to focus on K-12 education. In 2001 Barat College became part of DePaul University. Barat College's faculty were absorbed mostly by DePaul University and many of them still teach there today. The Society of the Sacred Heart sisters who still lived on campus were displaced to communities across the country. Barat's cemetery is still preserved, at the back of the property behind the dormitories. In March 2008, the Barat campus was one of several locations used for filming of a horror movie entitled The Unborn.

Changes were carried out by Election Commission of Pakistan in 1965 for the process of the voter's registration to hold the nationwide 1965 presidential election. In 1969‚Äì70, the amendments in the PIS program continued by the Election commission until the election commission supervised the 1970 general elections. After the 1971 war resulted in East-Pakistan gaining independence as Bangladesh, a new statistical database system was needed to ensure the safety of Pakistan's citizens as well as the national security of the country as questions were being raised over who was a Pakistani and who was not. So the Bhutto regime introduced a national registration act in the Parliament of Pakistan to establish an authority to issue photo IDs to all registered Pakistani citizens. In 1973, a new database system was codified under the Second Amendment, ¬ß30, of the Constitution of Pakistan to perform and contain the statistical database of the citizens of Pakistan. Registration of Pakistan's citizens and statistic database in government's computer accounts was started in 1973, with the promulgation of the constitution of the country. This new program was visioned and started by then Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. In 1973, in a parliamentary session, Bhutto stated in parliament to the people of Pakistan, \\"due to the absence of full statistical database of the people of this country, this country is operating in utter darkness\\". The government started issuing the National Identity Card (NIC) numbers to its citizens and started to establish government databases of the people in the government computers. National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) was established on 10 March 2000, by merging Directorate General of Registration Pakistan, a department created under the 1973 constitution, with the National Database Organization (NDO), an attached department under the Ministry of Interior, Government of Pakistan created for the 1998 census. NADRA is an autonomous body to operate independently with the mandate to replace the old directorate general of Registration with a computrised system of registering 150 million citizens, NADRA launched the Multi-Biometric National Identity Card project developed in conformance with international security documentation issuance practices in the year 2000. The program replaced the paper based Personal Identity System of Pakistan that had been in use since 1973. To date, over 96 million citizens in Pakistan and abroad have utilized the system and its allied services to receive tamper- resistant ISO standard Identification Documents. The organization flourished in the time period of former Chairman Mr. Ali Arshad Hakeem. Computerised National Identity Card The Computerised National Identity Card (CNIC) is a computerised national identity card issued by NADRA to Pakistani citizens. The CNIC was introduced in 2000 and, by 2012, over 89.5 million CNICs had been issued.89.5 million CNICs Issued; 95 Pc Population Covered Pakistan State Times (newspaper), Published 7 January 2012, Retrieved 22 February 2019 The CNIC is issued first at the age of 18. Under Pakistani law, it is not compulsory to carry one. However, for Pakistani citizens, the CNIC is mandatory for * Voting * Opening and operating bank accounts * Obtaining a passport * Purchasing vehicles and land * Obtaining a driver licence * Purchasing a plane or train ticket * Obtaining a mobile phone SIM card * Obtaining electricity, gas, and water * Securing admission to college and other post-graduate institutes * Conducting major financial transactions * Setting up a business Thus, it can be seen as a de facto necessity for meaningful civic life in Pakistan. = Requirements = In Pakistan, all adult citizens must register for the Computerised National Identity Card (CNIC) with a unique number upon reaching the age of 18. It serves as an identification document to authenticate an individual's identity as the citizen of Pakistan. Before introduction of the CNIC, manual National Identity Cards (NICs) were issued to citizens of Pakistan. Today, the Government has shifted all its existing records of National Identity Cards (NIC) to the central computerised database managed by NADRA. New CNIC's are machine-readable and carry facial and fingerprint information. Every citizen is required to have a NIC number, and the number is required for many activities such as getting a driver licence or passport, registering a vehicle, receiving social insurance/Zakat funding, enrolling in school, college or technical institute, filing a legal affidavit, wiring funds, paying taxes, opening a bank account, getting a utility connection (electricity, phone, mobile phone, water and sewer, natural gas), etc. However, since some births in the country are not registered, and some Pakistanis do not conduct any of the activities described above, a few do not have ID cards. In 2007, NADRA announced that it had issued 60 million CNIC (the C standing for computerized) numbers, which is approximately one-third of the population. The authority had issued the 10 millionth CNIC on 11 February 2002; 20 millionth on 18 June 2002; 30 millionth on 22 December 2003; 40 millionth on 1 October 2004; and 50 millionth CNIC on 14 February 2006.HOME - National Database and Registration Authority  Features  A unique 13-digit number are assigned at birth when the parents complete the child's birth registration form (Form RG-2, commonly known as B-Form or Child Registration Certificate (CRC), and then a National Identity Card (NIC) with the same number is issued at the age of 18. Until 2001, NIC numbers were 11 digits long. In 2001-2002, the authority started issuing 13-digit NIC numbers along with their new Biometric ID cards. The first 5 digits are based on the applicant's locality, the next 7 are random numbers, and the last digit is a check digit, even number for females and odd number for males. The old manual NIC numbers are invalid as of 1 January 2004. The ID card has the following information on it: Legal Name, Gender (male, female, or transgender), Father's name (Husband's name for married females), Identification Mark, Date of Birth, National Identity Card Number, Family Tree ID Number, Current Address, Permanent Address, Date of Issue, Date of Expiry, Signature, Photo, and Fingerprint (Thumbprint) NADRA also records the applicant's religion, but this is not noted on the CNIC itself. NADRA has registered over 90% of women in the Pakistan. Although NADRA has started issuing ultra modern SCNIC (Smart Computerized National Identity Card) too having information both in English and Urdu languages. Smart National Identity Card NADRA introduced the Smart National Identity Card (SNIC), Pakistan's first national electronic identity card, in October 2012. Pakistan's SNIC contains a data chip and 36 security features. The SNIC complies with ICAO standard 9303 and ISO standard 7816-4. The SNIC can be used for both offline and online identification, voting, pension disbursement, social and financial inclusion programmes and other services.http://www.nadra.gov.pk/images/04%20nadra-04.jpg NADRA aims to replace all 89.5 million CNICs with SNICs by 2020. = Security features = In order to address the security concerns, NADRA have incorporated 36 security features in the physical design of the card, making it one of the securest cards in the world. The card is printed in multiple layers and each layer has its own security features. The chip is encrypted by extremely competent software developers at NADRA and secure communication protocols have been determined for being read by remote devices. To enable remote verification of citizens a match-on-card applet has been designed by NADRA. When a citizen places their card into a card reader, the reader will first authenticate itself to the card. In return the card will verify its authenticity to the reader. If both the verifications are successful, the device will ask for a finger lpc NADRA on the card. This will enable verifications of individuals in the remotest parts of Pakistan. So say in a decade when an individual casts vote, the government may ascertain that the person casting the vote is indeed the same as the one on the electoral roll. This is only one of the thousands of scenarios of identity fraud prevention that the card empowers. A majority of the space in the chip has been made available for the private sector to use for their products and services. It might appear expensive for the private sector to use this card initially but once the number of citizens having critical mass is reached, it will be more profitable for the private sector to use this secure and universal platform. = Tracking Smart National Identity Card = In order to track a NADRA Smart Card, the tracking ID consisting of 12 digits is sent to 8400. For example, the tracking ID is 108231064935, and the message is sent to 8400, you will get the message \\"Your request against tracking id 108231064935 is with printing facility and expected delivery 2 working days\\".  Pak-identity  NADRA has started its service of online application for the NICOP, POC and CRC. Online data is collected e.g. fingerprints, thumb impressions and signatures. Online fee is submitted through debit or credit card.

It usually involves the injection of a small amount of contrast medium into the salivary duct of a single gland, followed by routine X-ray projections. The resulting diagram is called a sialogram. Indications Indications include: * In the evaluation of the functional integrity of the salivary glands * In case of obstructions * To evaluate the ductal pattern * In case of facial swellings, to rule out salivary gland pathology * In case of intra-glandular neoplasms. Contraindications include: * Persons who are allergic to iodine and/or contrast medium. * Cases where there is acute infection, * patients with thyroid function tests * When calculi are located in anterior part of the salivary gland duct Procedure Contrast agents are classified into two groups: fat-soluble contrast agents and water- soluble contrast agents. Water-soluble contrast agents can fill the finer elements of the ductal system. Fat-soluble contrast agents are viscous and can cause allergic reactions. These can also cause discomfort to the patients. Fat-soluble contrast agents do not fill finer elements of the duct. A baseline radiograph (scout film) of the required salivary gland would be taken, the duct is dilated using graded lacrimal probes, a cannula then is inserted in this salivary gland duct's opening in the mouth, then a radio-opaque fluid (contrast medium) is injected in the duct through a small tube. A series of radiographs would then be taken to determine the flow of the fluid, identify any obstructions and its location, the rate of fluid excretion from the gland. Usually the radiographs taken are lateral oblique views of the face as orthopantomograms are not useful for the purpose of locating the area due to superimpositions and the way they are taken to put the teeth in the main field. Interpretation This study is interpreted by evaluating the morphology of the salivary ducts for obstructions and chronic inflammation. Sialodochitis is a term describing dilation of the ducts caused by repeated inflammatory or infective processes. There is also irregular salivary duct stricture (narrowing) of the duct, which creates an appearance known as \\"sausage link\\" pattern on a sialogram. Suggestions of abscesses and autoimmune diseases such as Sj√∂gren syndrome can also be elicited. Sialadenitis is inflammation of the salivary glands, which may cause acinar atrophy and create an appearance known as \\"pruning of the tree\\" on a sialogram, where there are less branches visible from the duct system. A space occupying lesion that occurs within or adjacent to a salivary gland can displace the normal anatomy of the gland. This may create an appearance known as \\"ball in hand\\" on an sialogram, where the ducts are curved around the mass of the lesion. Adverse effects Like any medical imaging utilizing ionizing radiation, there will be a degree of direct ionizing damage and indirect damage from free radicals created during the ionization of water molecules within cells. The risk of causing the development of a malignant tumor is incredibly small, and is weighed against the benefits of the investigation on a case by case basis. Possible complications include: * Pain on injection, * Post procedural infection, * Ductal rupture, * Extravasation of contrast media, * Allergic reaction to iodine (which may present with urticaria, dyspnoea, and hypotension).

She served as President of the Board from 2000 to 2002 when the Board was abolished by the State of New York and power of the city schools was transferred to Mayor Michael Bloomberg.  Early life and education  Ninfa Segarra was born on June 4, 1950 to working-class Puerto Rican parents and grew up in the LaGuardia Houses on the Lower East Side. She attended Our Lady of Sorrows parochial school and Cathedral High School. In the ninth grade, she began joining protests championing Latino rights. While attending New York University (NYU) for undergrad, she worked for the ASPIRA Association, a left leaning group that works to empower Latino youth. She received her bachelor's in 1973 and attended New York Law School, graduating in 1982.  Career  Following her graduation from law school, Segarra was appointed by Mayor Ed Koch to the Mayor's Office of the Handicapped and to the Voter Assistance Commission as executive director. In 1990, then Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer appointed Segarra to the Board of Education having promised to appoint a Latino with children in the school system during his election campaign. On the Board, Segarra became a voice for conservative social values, most notably her role against Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez in a debate over condoms and social issues feeling they should be taught at schools citing the AIDS epidemic. As a Democrat, she later joined three conservative voices on the Board against an opt out plan for parents who didn't want their children to be taught these issues. This tipped the balance of power, cancelled the whole program, and prompted Fernandez to call her a \\"political prostitute.\\" She again joined forces with the conservatives to cancel Fernandez's contract in 1993. She later ran afoul of Ferrer, who asked her to resign. She dismissed the calls for her resignation and endorsed Rudy Giuliani for mayor in 1993. After being elected mayor in 1993, Giuliani's first appointment was of Segarra as a Deputy Mayor for Education and Human Services of New York City. As deputy mayor, Segarra oversaw education, health, and youth issues for the mayor, along with community outreach. Critics took issue with her appointment citing her lack of experience in the diverse fields and experience running only a small city agency. Giuliani also appointed Segarra as one of his two appointees to the Board of Education in 1993. Serving in two roles government roles placed Segarra in a political spotlight. Critics cited a conflict of interest, saying the Deputy Mayor is beholden to the mayoral administration and by holding that role, Segarra wouldn't effectively advocate for children of the city. In 2000, she became President of the Board and supported its abolition by Giuliani in 2001. In total, Ms. Segarra served on the Board of Education from July 1990 to June 2002. Segarra stepped down as deputy mayor in 2000 to first assume a position at the City University of New York (CUNY) as vice president for intercampus collaboration. She became the Executive Director of the New York City Police Museum in 2002 after being unable to provide her work schedules at CUNY in response to a request filed by the faculty union.  Personal life  Segarra met her first husband, Jose Segarra while attending NYU. The couple later had two children, Pablo (born 1983) and Alynda (born 1987). In 1989, Segarra split from Segarra, and Pablo lived with him while Alynda lived with her aunt and uncle in the Bronx. Alynda later went on to become frontwoman of Hurray for the Riff Raff.

(October 23, 1894 ‚Äì August 22, 1966), born Alexander Rudolph, was a boxing World Middleweight Champion from 1914 to 1917. He had a total of 157 bouts. Of those determined officially by boxing judges, he won 44 with 27 by knockout, and had 6 losses, and 6 draws. Around 107 of his fights were no decision bouts. Referees and judges in this era could not render a decision for fights in New York and most other states except in the case of a disqualification or knockout. McCoy's BoxRec record on the right has newspaper coverage determining the winner for his large number of no decision bouts. Newspapers could also determine the outcome of a fight as a draw. Early life and boxing career Al McCoy Front Row: McCoy's Boxing Manager, Jack Dougherty, McCoy, and O.K. Fitzsimmons in 1915 McCoy was born Alexander Rudolph in Rosenhayn, Deerfield Township, New Jersey, on October 23, 1894. As a child, he moved with his family to Brownsville, Brooklyn, New York City, where his father found work as a kosher butcher. At age 14 he helped make ends meet by filling in as a boxer for preliminary fights at local boxing clubs, when the scheduled boxers failed to show. Ken Blady speculates that his manager, Charley Goldman, had him change his surname to McCoy to hide his boxing from his religious parents who would have objected. Blady made the stunning observation that for his first nine years and 139 fights McCoy was undefeated. This made his winning streak second only to English boxer Hal Bagwell, although the fact that a no-decision bout did not officially count as a loss, probably aided McCoy's record.Blady, Ken (1988). The Jewish Boxer's Hall of Fame, Shapolsky Publishers, New York, New York, pp. 105‚Äì08. McCoy started boxing as a bantamweight, but fighting as a 138-pound lightweight in 1912, he began to attract attention. He defeated Young Erne, a competent Philadelphia lightweight, on November 9, 1912, in Philadelphia, winning in six rounds. The newspaper that gave him the edge noted that Erne was too out of condition to match well with the fit sixteen year old. Fighting as a welterweight, on March 2, 1912, in a ten-round newspaper decision, he defeated the more accomplished boxer Terry McGraw who he outweighed. Fighting on July 3, 1916, in Queens, he defeated Dave Kurtz in a ten-round newspaper decision. Not surprisingly, the seventeen year old's luck took a turn when he fought Young Otto, a more accomplished Jewish lightweight boxer from New York's Lower East Side, nine years his senior, who would hold a record for most consecutive first-round knockouts. McCoy lost to the lighter Otto, though fighting at 155 in the light middleweight range. In 1913, he battled even more impressive boxers, though winning far more rarely by knockout. In no decision bouts well into the middleweight range, he met Jewish boxer Soldier Bartfield, who would engage in close fights or defeat most of the great boxers of the era. He also matched with Terry Mitchell, Billy Grup, KO Brennan, Bull Anderson and the Zulu Kid. The newspapers had him winning all these standard ten round New York fights, except for a draw with the accomplished welterweight Zulu Kid. He even defeated the exceptional Soldier Bartfield on August 11, 1913, knocking him to the canvas three times in the fight. McCoy would never again decisively beat Bartfield, though he would meet him at least four more times in his career. Though never winning a world title, Bartfield would meet and often defeat more champions and top contenders than nearly any other boxer of his era. McCoy fought Wildcat Ferns to two draws by decision in Ohio where referees could determine the outcome of a bout without a foul or knockout occurring. Winning the Middleweight World Championship George Chip, Middleweight Champion McCoy was originally scheduled to fight Joseph Chip in April 1914. When Joe Chip fell ill, his brother, Middleweight World Title holder George consented to the bout, probably considering it unlikely he would lose by knockout to nineteen year old McCoy. For Chip to lose his title in New York, a knockout would be required. In his last 100 bouts, McCoy had only a 23% knockout rate, impressive, but probably not perceived as a serious threat to the Middleweight World Champion Chip. Manager Charlie Goldman wisely advised McCoy to charge for a knockout from the first bell, assuming that Chip would box cautiously early in the first round against Al's unorthodox, left handed style. Taking his manager's advice, on April 7, 1914, McCoy landed a powerful left to Chip's jaw early in the first round, lifting him off the canvas, and achieving a victory that probably shocked the bookmakers. The knockout occurred just one minute and fifty seconds into the first around. The Pittsburgh Press noted that the Broadway Sporting Club in Brooklyn was only \\"fairly filled\\" as spectators may have stayed home expecting a loss or poor showing by their hometown boy. Robert Edgren, summarizing the last few seconds of the fight, wrote \\"McCoy's left fist started somewhere near his knees. He brought it up with all his strength. His body swung upward with the blow as though he had been swinging at a bag. His fist landed fairly on the point of the crouching champion's unguarded chin.\\"Edgren, Robert (January 24, 1937) \\"Al McCoy Took Middleweight Title from George Chip with One Punch\\". The Pittsburgh Press, p. 21, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Gazette Times noted that McCoy's winning punch was a counterpunch, and wrote, \\"Chip, eager to grasp his opportunity, started a right swing that had all the earmarks of a haymaker. McCoy crossed in with his left, shooting over a hybrid punch which was half swing and half uppercut, and the New Castle fighter (Chip) went down flat, his head striking the floor of the ring.\\"\\"Uppercut from Al McCoy Under Chin Sends Chip into Dreamland\\", The Gazette Times, p. 10, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 8 April 1914 Aged 19, he became the youngest person as well as the first left handed-boxer ever to win a Middleweight World championship. It was also the shortest fight on record in which a boxer had taken a World Title from an opponent. As the result of his youth, and unorthodox style, many boxing writers and fans considered McCoy's ascent to the world title a fluke. The Tacoma Times, were not alone in their sentiments when they wrote three a half full years after McCoy had taken the title, \\"Early in 1914, Chip (George) unfortunately ran into a punch in the first round of his bout with Al McCoy, and the latter assumed the title. McCoy was never a real champion and usually dodged anyone who was likely to knock him out.\\" The New York Evening World wrote ten months after he took the title from Chip, \\"McCoy has held the title technically, as no one has in turn knocked him out. But as a champion our old friend Al is a mirth-producing object.\\"\\"Mike O'Dowd, Fighting Harp, Takes Crown From Al McCoy\\", The Tacoma Times, p.6, Tacoma, Washington, 26 November 1917Edgren, R. (February 16, 1915) \\"Dancing Will Have a New Boom as a Popular Sport if Ritchie Polishes Off Welsh\\", Evening World, p. 11, New York City. Soldier Bartfield His successful defense of the title for 42 consecutive bouts would prove he deserved the honor of Middleweight World Champion. In fact, at 42 bouts, according to Ken Blady, McCoy had the longest undefeated streak of any boxer to ever hold a title. While holding the championship, he allowed most of the world's top contenders to challenge him for it. He fought Soldier Bartfield twice on November 10, and 22, 1914 in Brooklyn losing by the decision of newspapers in ten round bouts. Though not gaining a decided edge in the two well fought bouts, the exceptional Bartfield was unable to land a knockout, and so McCoy retained the title. He took on top contenders Willie Lewis, Willie KO Brennan, Jewish contender Emmit \\"Kid\\" Wagner, and Italian Joe Gans, losing only to Brennan by the decision of newspapers in their middleweight matchups. His bout with Lewis on October 13, 1914, at the Broadway Sporting Club in Brooklyn, resulted in a near knockout of Lewis, once a top welterweight contender, in the fourth round. New London's The Day noted, \\"the bell saved Lewis in the fourth round. He was tottering, incapable of defense, when the bell rang. He came up for the final round (fifth) groggy\\", and McCoy consequently knocked him out, using his left to deliver the telling blow in the prior round.\\"Al McCoy Hands Lewis His Insomnia Cure\\", New London Day, p. 11, New London, Connecticut, 14 October 1914. On January 25, 1915, he defeated the talented Joe Borrell by the decision of newspapers in a six-round bout in Philadelphia. Borrel had ended the career of ex-welterweight world champion Harry Lewis two years earlier when Lewis had resumed boxing too soon after being injured in a car accident. McCoy's March 23, 1915, bout with Silent Martin may have been a closer affair, as the Evening News wrote that McCoy \\"had the better of Silent Martin in seven of the ten rounds in Brooklyn,\\" though several New York papers gave the close bout to Martin.\\"Results of Last Night's Best Bouts\\", The Evening News, p. 4, Providence, Rhode Island, March 24, 1915. On April 6, 1915, again in Brooklyn, McCoy fought a thrilling rematch with George Chip in Brooklyn, and though losing the ten round no-decision bout in the opinion of the New York Times, Chip could not knockout McCoy, and so he retained the world title. The following month on May 4, 1915, again in Brooklyn, he fought contender Jimmy Clabby, in another title match where he successfully defended against a knockout. The New London Day noted that McCoy's primary aim was to prevent a knockout, and that he did not fight with a decided edge. The paper wrote that with Clabby \\"McCoy entered the ring with the sole intention of employing every means to stay the limit, and he was successful.\\" The Day further noted that the boxing seemed listless, and that when Clabby \\"showed an inclination to exchange blows at short range, McCoy usually declined the issue,\\" but that \\"Clabby was the agressor (sic) at all times.\\"\\"McCoy is Hammered by Jimmy Clabby\\", New London Day, p. 12, New London, Connecticut, May 5, 1915. Again fighting in Brooklyn, he faced top contenders Young Ahearn and Silent Martin, completing both title bouts without receiving a decisive knockout. In November 1915, he held off another challenge from Silent Martin. Later career and losing the Middleweight World Title Harry Greb, 1926 Middleweight Champion In 1916, he took on Young Ahearn in another title bout, and rematched with George Chip in a non-title fight, forgoing knockouts in both bouts, but not gaining an advantage in the decisions of the New York Times. His strenuous schedule with top contenders had begun to wear on McCoy. Through 1916, he fared better achieving several knockouts against opponents who were of less caliber, before taking on a critical bout with 1926 World Middleweight Champion Harry Greb on April 30, 1917. The Pittsburgh Post had Greb winning every round in a match where McCoy seemed clearly outmatched, but was unable to gain a knockout, even in the tenth round where he attempted in vain to land the telling blow. McCoy finally lost his Middleweight Title on November 14, 1917, in his home city of Brooklyn against Mike O'Dowd, losing by a 6th-round knockout. The New London Day noted that McCoy was simply unable to fend off the blows of O'Dowd, writing \\"The men fought toe-to-toe from bell to bell, not because McCoy wished it thus, but because Mike kept boring in and swinging both hands to the head and body. Al tried to clinch after every lead, but O'Dowd forced the champion to break away by the fury of his attack.\\" The Day further noted that McCoy took punishment in the first three rounds but that by the fourth took much heavier blows to the jaw and midsection. McCoy was down more than once in the fourth largely from blows to the face, but managed to knock O'Dowd down once with his signature left hook. In the sixth round, McCoy was down twice from head and body blows before finally having his cornermen throw in the towel at a count of six on his third knockdown.\\"St. Paul Fighter is New Champion,\\" New London Day, p. 10, New London, Connecticut, November 15, 1917. He rematched with future middleweight champion Greb on May 13, 1918, demonstrating his willingness to take on top talent even after his loss of the title, but was again outmatched by his stronger, more aggressive opponent. Though Greb had already defeated some exceptional challengers, McCoy had suffered through forty-six defenses while champion from the toughest of title contenders. Later life Retiring from East Coast boxing, McCoy moved to Los Angeles with his wife Ruth. Trying his hand at movies, he appeared in a role credited as \\"pug\\" in 20th Century Picture's 1933 The Bowery. Also appearing in the movie were New York Jewish boxers Phil Bloom, Joe Glick, and Abe Hollandersky, \\"Fireman\\" Jim Flynn, and heavyweight Frank Moran. The film involved a rivalry between bar owner Chuck Connors and central character Steve Brody. It was set in the New York Bowery, in the Lower East side of Manhattan, around the 1890s, and contained a lot of non-professional fighting. Actor George Walsh played real life character Steve Brodie, who indeed owned a Bowery bar and won fame jumping off the Brooklyn Bridge. The other primary character Chuck Connors, played by Wallace Beery, managed a professional boxer. In a brief bit, Walsh is revealed to be Irish heavyweight boxing champion John L. Sullivan. On October 9, 1937 McCoy appeared in the \\"Night of Memories\\" benefit for Wad Wadhams, at Hollywood Legion Stadium. Wadhams was the victim of a stroke and had mounting medical bills. In his career, he had worked as a boxing promoter matching boxers for legendary boxing promoter \\"Colonel\\" Jack Doyle who had completed contracts for Jack Dempsey. Other featured boxers included Henry Armstrong, Jack Silver, Jimmy McLarnin, and Jackie Fields.Additional boxers included Mushy Callahan, Fidel La Barba, Maxie Rosenbloom, Jim Jeffries and others, \\"Wadham's Benefit Tonight\\", Los Angeles Times, p. A-10, Los Angeles, October 9, 1937. Death When McCoy lost his home and most of his possessions in a fire in 1964, his health took a turn for the worse. Living on only a small state pension, chronic illness restricted him to living in a nursing home. He died on August 22, 1966, in Los Angeles, California. Legacy and titles held McCoy's professional record according to one source: 157 bouts ‚Äî won 99 (26 KOs), lost 40, no-decisions 18. Note that newspaper decisions vary. McCoy, who was Jewish, was inducted into the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 1989.

Project The initiative involved four standard algorithms: a data encryption algorithm called Skipjack, along with the Clipper chip that included the Skipjack algorithm, a digital signature algorithm, Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA), a hash function, SHA-1, and a key exchange protocol. Capstone's first implementation was in the Fortezza PCMCIA card. All Capstone components were designed to provide 80-bit security. The initiative encountered massive resistance from the cryptographic community, and eventually the US government abandoned the effort. The main reasons for this resistance were concerns about Skipjack's design, which was classified, and the use of key escrow in the Clipper chip.

Hart history In 1943, Hartvig ‚ÄúHart‚Äù Holmberg opened a carpentry shop in St. Paul, Minnesota, specializing in designing and manufacturing customized cribbage boards, chess sets and wood or metal card games. Word of Hartvig‚Äôs ability to create fine crafted goods quickly spread. Soon, the shop began to take on custom jobs using a variety of commercial manufacturing techniques, primarily custom painting and sheet metal work. This work led to fabricating runners for Ski-Doo snowmobiles.Classic Skis. \\"Classic Ski Brands and Manufacturers.\\" . Retrieved 28 July 2010 Hartvig's brother Harry worked as a ski engineer and designer for Gregg Skis in St. Paul. Knowing that the addition of a seamless metal edge would revolutionize ski design, Harry called upon Hartvig‚Äôs manufacturing skills and together they began working on a prototype. They developed a laminated metal ski, with a continuous steel edge spot-welded to a perforated steel bottom sheet and an aluminum top sheet.Seth Masia: Hart Skis, in Skiing History magazine, Sept. 2010 page 37 After three years of creating and refining, Hartvig, Harry and friend Ed Bjork were ready. In 1955, the first \\"Hart\\" metal-edged ski was introduced. At its peak in the late 1960s, Hart shipped 144,000 pairs of skis a year, achieving revenues in the tens of millions. It also was during the 1960s that freestyle skiing became a global phenomenon.^ Youngblood, Dick. \\"Hart Ski: Long way back to the top.\\" [4]. December 6, 2005 In 1968, the three original partners sold the company to Beatrice Foods, a conglomerate. Beatrice cut back on R&D;, falling behind the competition as fiberglass skis were introduced. With sales plummeting, Beatrice sold Hart Ski in 1980 to an investor group, one of at least three groups that tried to revive the business in the next 18 years. By 1998, only 5,000 pairs of skis were shipped and the line was abandoned, until 2003, when another investor group led by the Grandson of Hartvig Holmberg, Bill Holmberg Jr., resuscitated the label with a goal of resurrecting the Hart name. The company was refinanced and restructured as a type \\"C\\" Corp from an LLC in 2007, and corporate headquarters were moved to Ogden, Utah in 2010. Hart skis are currently manufactured on an outsource contract basis in Colorado (Never Summer production facility), Washington State (Snow Board Parts Inc.) and Italy. Pioneer in freestyle skiing The evolution of freestyle skiing can be traced to 1907, when the first ski flip was recorded.

Ski enthusiasts in Vermont were the first to witness the feats of Goellner and Tom Leroy, who performed simultaneous inverted aerials to the astonishment of large ski-show crowds. In 1965, Swiss racer Art Furrer appeared on the U.S. ski scene. Claiming that increased agility through acrobatics on skis could improve ski performance, Furrer thrilled crowds. His stunts included ‚Äúthe butterfly,‚Äù ‚Äúthe Charleston‚Äù and a crossed-ski turn called the ‚Äújavelin.‚Äù Furrer‚Äôs relationship with Hart Skis and his early appearance in ski press photos performing stunts made him ‚Äúthe face‚Äù of the 1960s freestyle movement.Lund, Morten. \\"Art Furrer And His Incredible Skis.\\" June 2005.

Londonderry Mall has many notable stores, including a full service Shoppers Drug Mart, Save On Foods, Hudson's Bay, Winners, Dollar Tree, Dollarama, Miniso, Fabricland, Fit 4 Less, Simons department store, Flight Centre and H&M.; Londonderry Mall has the last Edmonton Public Library located inside a mall. The mall recently went under a complete renovation which completed in August 2017. History Londonderry Mall opened in 1972 with 85 stores and services. When it opened, it was the largest two-floor enclosed shopping centre in western Canada. Original tenants included The Bay (which still occupies the same location), Woolco, and a movie theatre. Later, it would expand to include Safeway. The mall underwent its first major expansion in late 1979, then again in the later 1980s. The mall added a wing to the west, and then to the south, which included Eatons, and the Edmonton Public Library. The mall expanded to 150 stores and services. A renovation was completed in 1990 which saw the opening of a new food court in the center of the mall. In the late 1990s, Eatons closed. Save-On-Foods promptly moved into the former Eaton's space on the lower level and Winners on the upper level. In late 2013, the relocation and closing of many major tenants and small stores left the mall with many unoccupied spaces. In late 2014, the mall announced a complete mall renovation and remerchandising project. Army & Navy and Sport Chek Supercentre had moved out of the mall to make way for a newly announced Simons store. Winners re- located to an unused space, which made way for re-location of the food court to the former Winners space. Fabricland remained in the former Winners space while Dollarama re-located to the new food court from a neighbouring space where Sport Chek was formerly located to make way for H&M.; Renovation In September 2014, Londonderry Mall publicly announced a renovation and remerchandising project. The renovation completely changed the face of the mall, including all new entrances, lighting, escalators, elevators, along with the relocation of many stores and the food court. The renovation was designed by MMC Architects and GH+A Design and was completed in August 2017. The demolition of the mall was complete by mid-2015, which included the removal of all elevators, escalators, water fountains and plant-beds. The first phase of the renovation was complete in June 2016, which included the relocation of the food court and the renovation of the mall common areas. The second phase of the renovation completed in August 2017, in which the new Simons store opened to the public, along with much smaller local Alberta based stores.

In mid-1970, Mike Love re-wrote the lyrics after learning of the Kent State Shootings where four unarmed college students protesting the Cambodian Campaign were killed by the Ohio National Guard on Monday, May 4, 1970. Stephen Desper, engineer of the Beach Boys during this period, explained the genesis and context behind the song: Other events referred to in the song include (in order of appearance): * Autumn 1964 ‚Äì Berkeley Free Speech Movement * May 1969 ‚Äì People's Park, also in Berkeley, California * June 1970 ‚Äì rioting in Isla Vista, California * May 14‚Äì15, 1970 ‚Äì Jackson State killings * May 4, 1970 ‚Äì Kent State shootings \\"Student Demonstration Time\\" (backed with \\"Don't Go Near the Water\\") was released as a single in the Netherlands‚Äîwhere it peaked at #21‚Äîand Italy, as well as Australia, where it charted during 1972. However, for the British and German releases of the single, the A-side and B-side were switched, resulting in \\"Don't Go Near the Water\\" being the A-side.

Finley National Wildlife Refuge is a natural area in the Willamette Valley in Oregon, United States. It was created to provide wintering habitat for dusky Canada geese. Unlike other Canada geese, dusky Canada geese have limited summer and winter ranges. They nest on Alaska's Copper River Delta and winter almost exclusively in the Willamette Valley. Habitat loss, predation, and hunting have caused a decrease in population. Located ten miles south of Corvallis, Oregon, the refuge protects many of the historic habitats of the valley, including the largest remaining tract of native Willamette Valley wet prairie. Fields of wildlife food crops are interspersed with Oregon white oak savannah, meandering creeks with bottomland Oregon ash forest, old growth bigleaf maple, and native prairie. Other management goals are to preserve native species and enhance biodiversity including the rare oak savannah, upland prairie, and wet prairie habitats. Endangered and threatened species such as Oregon chub, and Bradshaw's desert parsley find protection and sanctuary on the refuge. A herd of Roosevelt elk can be found in the bottomland forests or farm fields on the refuge. Under cooperative agreements, area farmers plant refuge fields to produce nutritious grasses preferred by geese. The geese also need water for resting and foraging habitat. Many refuge wetlands occur naturally; others are created by dikes and levees. Some refuge wetlands, drained or channelized by previous owners, are being restored in low-lying areas of the refuge to increase diversity and desirability of habitat for wildlife. The majority of wetlands are being managed as moist soil units, to promote growth of wetland food plants (millet, smartweed, sedges, etc.) used as food by waterfowl and other wildlife. By resting in undisturbed areas on the refuges, wintering geese regain energy reserves required for migration and nesting. This sanctuary reduces depredation problems on neighboring private lands. Of historic interest is the Fiechter House, completed in 1857, and thought to be the oldest house in Benton County. The refuge was named for William L. Finley, an early conservationist who persuaded President Theodore Roosevelt to set aside the first National Wildlife Refuge west of the Mississippi River. Two county roads passing through the refuge are open to the public throughout the year. Similar access is also provided at four viewpoints (kiosks and bulletin boards) and two trails (Woodpecker Loop and Mill Hill). To provide a quiet resting area, waterfowl habitat is closed to public entry while the geese are in residence, from November 1 through March 31. This winter waterfowl closure includes all portions of the refuge except the two trails, kiosks, bulletin boards, and headquarters building.

It is a diverse genus which contains about 114 species and many more to be described. It is also the largest genus in Argiinae. They are found in the Western Hemisphere. They are commonly known as dancers. Although the genus name comes from , dancers are quite active and alert damselflies. The bluer Argia species may be confused with Enallagma species. Characteristics This genus of damselflies are known as dancers because of the distinctive jerky form of flight they use which contrasts with the straightforward direct flight of bluets, forktails and other pond damselflies. They are usually to be seen in the open where they catch flying insects on the wing rather than flying about among vegetation picking off sedentary prey items. They tend to land and perch flat on the ground, logs and rocks. When perched, they usually hold their wing slightly raised above the abdomen. The males of most species are some combination of black and blue but they can easily be told from similarly coloured bluets by their mode of flight. Some species have red eyes and others a copper-coloured thorax. Many species have humeral stripes, either notched or forked at the end or narrowed in the centre. The wings have short petioles and are relatively broad close to the base. Unlike most of the Coenagrionidae, dancers are often associated with flowing water.

It depicts Jesus Christ on the cross in a darkened sky floating over a body of water complete with a boat and fishermen. Although it is a depiction of the crucifixion, it is devoid of nails, blood, and a crown of thorns, because, according to Dal√≠, he was convinced by a dream that these features would mar his depiction of Christ. Also in a dream, the importance of depicting Christ in the extreme angle evident in the painting was revealed to him. Title Crucifixion sketch by St. John of the Cross, c. 1550, which inspired Dal√≠ The painting is known as the Christ of Saint John of the Cross, because its design is based on a drawing by the 16th-century Spanish friar John of the Cross. The composition of Christ is also based on a triangle and circle (the triangle is formed by Christ's arms; the circle is formed by Christ's head). The triangle, since it has three sides, can be seen as a reference to the Trinity, and the circle may be an allusion to Platonic thought. The circle represents Unity: all things do exist in the \\"three\\" but in the four, merry they be.Gaultier, Alyse. The Little Book of Dal√≠. Paris: Flammarion, 2004. Inspiration On the bottom of his studies for the painting, Dal√≠ explained its inspiration: \\"In the first place, in 1950, I had a 'cosmic dream' in which I saw this image in colour and which in my dream represented the 'nucleus of the atom.' This nucleus later took on a metaphysical sense; I considered it 'the very unity of the universe,' the Christ!\\"Descharnes, Robert. Dal√≠. New York: Harry N. Abrams, Inc., 2003. In order to create the figure of Christ, Dal√≠ had Hollywood stuntman Russell Saunders suspended from an overhead gantry, so he could see how the body would appear from the desired angle and also envisage the pull of gravity on the human body. The depicted body of water is the bay of Port Lligat, Dal√≠'s residence at the time of the painting. History The painting and intellectual property rights were acquired for Glasgow Corporation in 1952 by Tom Honeyman, then the Director of Glasgow Museums. Honeyman bought the painting for ¬£8,200, a price considered high at the time although it was less than the ¬£12,000 catalogue price, and included the copyright, which has earned Glasgow Museums back the original cost many times over. The purchase was controversial and a petition against it, arguing that the money should be spent on exhibition space for local artists, was presented to the City Council by students at Glasgow School of Art. The controversy caused Honeyman and Dal√≠ to become friends, corresponding with each other for many years after the original acquisition. The painting first went on display at the city's Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum on 23 June 1952. In 1961 a visitor attacked the painting with a stone and tore the canvas with his hands. It was successfully restored over several months by conservators at Kelvingrove and returned to public display. In 1993, the painting was moved to the city's St Mungo Museum of Religious Life and Art, but returned to Kelvingrove for its reopening in July 2006. It won a poll to decide Scotland's favourite painting in 2006, with 29% of the vote.\\"Salvador Dali's 'Christ of St John of the Cross' Wins Herald Poll\\", GlasgowMuseums.com, 30 August 2005. Critical reception This painting has continued to generate controversy. At the time of its purchase by Honeyman, the verdict by modern art critics was that producing such a traditional painting was a stunt by an artist already famous for his surrealist art. In 2009 The Guardian art critic, Jonathan Jones, described it as \\"kitsch and lurid\\", but noted that the painting was \\"for better or worse, probably the most enduring vision of the crucifixion painted in the 20th century.\\" In May 2013, in BBC Radio 4's Great Lives, British poet John Cooper Clarke described this image as being utterly different from any other image of the crucifixion, as the angle of view conveys the hanging pain of this method of execution, whilst hiding the ordinarily clich√©d facial expressions normally seen in such depictions.

The condition is often divided based on the severity into two types, macromastia and gigantomastia. Hypertrophy of the breast tissues may be caused by increased histologic sensitivity to certain hormones such as female sex hormones, prolactin, and growth factors. Breast hypertrophy is a benign progressive enlargement, which can occur in both breasts (bilateral) or only in one breast (unilateral). It was first scientifically described in 1648. Description and types The indication is a breast weight that exceeds approximately 3% of the total body weight. There are varying definitions of what is considered to be excessive breast tissue, that is the expected breast tissue plus extraordinary breast tissue, ranging from as little as up to with most physicians defining macromastia as excessive tissue of over . Some resources distinguish between macromastia (Greek, macro: large, mastos: breast), where excessive tissue is less than 2.5 kg, and gigantomastia (Greek, gigantikos: giant), where excessive tissue is more than 2.5 kg. The enlargement can cause muscular discomfort and over-stretching of the skin envelope, which can lead in some cases to ulceration.Note: the criterium of >600g is used with the term \\"macromastia\\" in this source: Hypertrophy of the breast can affect the breasts equally, but usually affects one breast more than the other, thereby causing asymmetry, when one breast is larger than the other. The condition can also individually affect the nipples and areola instead of or in addition to the entire breast. The effect can produce a minor size variation to an extremely large breast asymmetry. Breast hypertrophy is classified in one of five ways: as either pubertal (virginal hypertrophy), gestational (gravid macromastia), in adult women without any obvious cause, associated with penicillamine therapy, and associated with extreme obesity. Many definitions of macromastia and gigantomastia are based on the term of \\"excessive breast tissue\\", and are therefore somewhat arbitrary. A total of 115 cases of breast hypertrophy had been reported in the literature as of 2008. =Virginal breast hypertrophy= When gigantomastia occurs in young women during puberty, the medical condition is known as juvenile macromastia or juvenile gigantomastia and sometimes as virginal breast hypertrophy or virginal mammary hypertrophy. Along with the excessive breast size, other symptoms include red, itchy lesions and pain in the breasts. A diagnosis is made when an adolescent's breasts grow rapidly and achieve great weight, usually soon after her first menstrual period. Some doctors suggest that the rapid breast development occurs before the onset of menstruation. Some women with virginal breast hypertrophy experience breast growth at a steady rate for several years, after which the breasts rapidly develop exceeding normal growth. Some adolescent females experience minimal or negligible breast growth until their breasts suddenly grow very rapidly in a short period of time. This may cause considerable physical discomfort. Women suffering VBH often experience an excessive growth of their nipples as well. In severe cases of VBH, hypertrophy of the clitoris occurs. At the onset of puberty, some females with who have experienced little or no breast development can reportedly reach three or more cup sizes within a few days (see below). As of 1992, 70 cases of virginal breast hypertrophy had been reported. =Gestational breast hypertrophy= This same effect can also occur at the onset of pregnancy or between the 16th to 20th week of gestation. When the swelling in the connective tissue occurs after birth, it can negatively impact long term milk supply. The swelling increases with each subsequent pregnancy. The extremely rapid growth of the breasts can result in intense heat. The woman's breasts can generate extraordinary discomfort, turning feverish, red, itchy, and even causing the skin to peel. The swelling can suppress the milk supply, pinching off the milk ducts, and leading to mastitis. Gestational gigantomastia is estimated to in 1 out of every 28,000 to 100,000 pregnancies. Breast size in women with gestational breast hypertrophy typically reverts to approximately pre- pregnancy size or near it after pregnancy and cessation of breastfeeding. This is not always the case however and in some only partial reduction in breast size may occur, necessitating surgical breast reduction. =Other types of breast hypertrophy= Only 15% of cases of breast hypertrophy are unrelated to puberty or pregnancy. Other types and causes of breast hypertrophy include idiopathic, drug-induced (e.g., penicillamine, cyclosporine, bucillamine), autoimmunity-associated, tumors, and syndromes. Two case reports of prepubertal breast hypertrophy, both in infants, have been reported. Causes The underlying cause of the rapidly growing breast connective tissue, resulting in gigantic proportions, has not been well-elucidated. However, proposed factors have included increased levels/expression of or heightened sensitivity to certain hormones (e.g., estrogen, progesterone, and prolactin) and/or growth factors (e.g., hepatic growth factor, insulin-like growth factor 1, and epidermal growth factor) in the breasts. Macromastic breasts are reported to be composed mainly of adipose and fibrous tissue, while glandular tissue remains essentially stable. Macromastia occurs in approximately half of women with aromatase excess syndrome (a condition of hyperestrogenism). Hyperprolactinemia has been reported as a cause of some cases of macromastia. Macromastia has also been associated with hypercalcemia (which is thought to be due to excessive production of parathyroid hormone- related protein) and, rarely, systemic lupus erythematosus and pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia. It is also notable that approximately two-thirds of women with macromastia are obese. Aside from aromatase (as in aromatase excess syndrome), at least two other genetic mutations (one in PTEN) have been implicated in causing macromastia. A handful of drugs have been associated with gigantomastia, including penicillamine, bucillamine, neothetazone, ciclosporin, indinavir, and prednisolone. Treatment Medical treatment has not proven consistently effective. Medical regimens have included tamoxifen, progesterone, bromocriptine, the gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist leuprorelin, and testosterone. Gestational macromastia has been treated with breast reduction drugs alone without surgery. Surgical therapy includes reduction mammaplasty and mastectomy. However, breast reduction is not clinically indicated unless at least 1.8 kg (4 lb) of tissue per breast needs to be removed. In the majority of cases of macromastia, surgery is medically unnecessary, depending on body height. Topical treatment includes regimens of ice to cool the breasts. Treatment of hyperprolactinemia- associated macromastia with D2 receptor agonists such as bromocriptine and cabergoline has been found to be effective in some, but not all cases. Danazol, an antiestrogen and weak androgen, has also been found to be effective in the treatment of macromastia. When hypertrophy occurs in adolescence, noninvasive treatments, including pharmaceutical treatment, hormone therapy, and steroid use are not usually recommended due to known and unknown side effects. Once breast growth rate has stabilized, breast reduction may be an appropriate choice. In some instances after aggressive or surgical treatment, the breast may continue to grow or re-grow, a complete mastectomy may be recommended as a last resort. Pregnancy is recognized as the second most common reason for hypertrophy. When secondary to pregnancy, it may resolve itself without treatment after the pregnancy ends. Society and culture =Difficulties= Extremely large breasts are a source of considerable attention. Some women try to hide or mask their breasts with special clothing, including minimizing bras. Women with this condition may be subject to psychological problems due to unwanted attention and/or harassment. Depression is common among sufferers. In the case of a 12-year-old Japanese girl reported in 1993, her \\"massively enlarged\\" breasts caused her \\"intense psychological problems, incapacitating her in school activities and social relations.\\" Actress Soleil Moon Frye, who starred as a child in the sitcom Punky Brewster, reported in an interview with People magazine that boys taunted her, calling her \\"Hey, Punky Boobster!\\" It affected her professional and social life negatively. \\"People started to think of me as a bimbo,\\" she said in the interview. \\"I couldn't sit up straight without people looking at me like I was a prostitute,\\" Frye said. Finding large bra sizes and styles that fit is challenging. Also, larger bras are more costly, challenging to find, and unflattering to the wearer. Ill-fitting bras with narrow straps can cause chronic irritation, redness, and indentations in the shoulders. Skin rashes under the breasts are common, particularly during warm weather. Heavy breasts may cause headaches, neck pain, upper and lower back pain, and numbness or tingling in the fingers. =Medical insurance coverage= Insurance companies in the United States typically require the physician to provide evidence that a woman's large breasts cause headaches or back and neck pain before they will pay for reduction mammoplasty. Insurance companies also mandate a woman who is overweight, which is often the case with gigantomastia, to first lose a certain amount of weight. They also commonly require the patient to try alternative treatments like physical therapy for a year or more. =Reported instances= Gigantomastia The first recorded case of gigantomastia, diagnosed in a 23- or 24-year-old woman, circa 1670. In 1670, the physician Durston drew this illustration of first recorded case of non-gravid gigantomastia; the woman died of the condition. One early and extreme case study of gigantomastia dates to 1670. The patient died four months after the onset of enlargement. One breast removed after the woman's death weighed 29 kg (64 lb). A painting by Lam Qua of Lu-shi, age 42, on April 17, 1848, prior to breast reduction surgery. On April 17, 1848, a 42-year-old woman named Lu-shi was treated for hypertrophy in a Chinese hospital. She was treated by a missionary physician. On December 24, 1849, the left breast, measuring 67 cm (26.5 in) in circumference, and weighing 2.7 kg (6 lb), was removed in a procedure lasting three and a half minutes. The right breast was removed one month later. It measured 61 cm (24 in) in circumference and weighed 2.5 kg (5.5 lb). In 2005, a woman reported that her breasts grew at puberty from nothing to a C cup in one month. When she became pregnant for the first time, her breasts increased two cup sizes in a few days. Immediately after her first birth, her breasts grew three cup sizes. After her second child was born, her breasts increased six cup sizes. After her third childbirth, they grew 10 cup sizes, and after her fourth child was born, they grew nine cup sizes. In this instance, the swelling abated about 10 days after childbirth, but her bra cup size remained E to a G for the next year. About one year postpartum, her breasts rapidly atrophied to AA cup size. One of the most severe cases of macromastia was reported from Ilorin in Nigeria. In 2007, Dr Ganiyu Adebisi Rahman and his colleagues reported the case of a 26-year-old woman who presented with massive swelling of her breasts and bilateral axillary swellings of 6 years duration. Dr Rahman led a team of surgeons in Ilorin to perform a total bilateral excision of the hypertrophied axillary breasts, and bilateral breast amputation with composite nipple-areola complex graft of the normally located breasts. The total weight of the breast tissues removed was 44.8 kilograms. Another extreme case was observed in 2008 in Maria Vittoria Hospital in Turin, Italy, where the amount removed from both breasts was 17.2 kg (38 lb). The growth occurred during puberty making it a case of juvenile gigantomastia, but the patient did not seek treatment until the age of 29. Another extreme case was observed on August 28, 2003, when a 24-year- old woman was admitted to the Clinical Center Skopje in Macedonia with gigantomastia of pregnancy and the amount later removed from both breasts was 15 kg (33 lb) in total. A second case in Macedonia was reported when the breasts of a 30-year-old woman from a remote mountain village in eastern Macedonia suddenly grew to more than total. As the disorder becomes more widely known, media reports have increased. French Canadian Isabelle Lanthier appeared on Montel Williams' talk show where she told how her chest grew from 86 cm (34 in) to 133 cm (52.5 in) in five months during her pregnancy. At their largest, one breast weighed 6.8 kg (15 lb) and the other 5.4 kg (12 lb). Her husband custom-made a special bra to support her breasts. In 2007, a Chilean TV station covered the story of 32-year-old Yasna Galleguillos from Antofagasta, who experienced ongoing back pain, making everyday tasks very difficult to perform. She underwent breast reduction surgery to relieve her pain. Surgeons removed from one breast and from the other breast. On October 29, 2009, the Philippine television network GMA News and Public Affairs, producers of Wish Ko Lang (\\"Just My Wish\\") hosted by Vicky Morales, profiled the story of Pilma Cabrijas, a 30-year-old woman afflicted by gigantomastia. The woman was told by a folk healer that her condition may have been caused by a curse. The measured bust circumference without appropriate bra support was 160 cm (63 in). The weight of her breasts was not reported in detail, but seemed to weigh \\"as much as two children.\\" She had breast reduction surgery performed, but her breasts regrew. The producers of Wish Ko Lang paid for additional surgery. Virginal breast hypertrophy In 1993, the Japanese journal Surgery Today reported on the case of a 12-year-old girl. Only tall and weighing , her breasts began to develop at age 11 before the onset of menstruation. Over the next eight months, both breasts grew abnormally large, and physicians treating her found that her physiological development was normal except for her breasts. The weight produced by their symmetrical and massive enlargement resulted in marked curvature of the spine. Lab tests of her blood for hormones and biochemical substances showed normal values, though tests revealed that it might have been caused by hypersensitivity to estrogen. She underwent a bilateral reduction mammoplasty. Surgeons removed of tissue from her right breast and from her left breast. She was administered tamoxifen afterward to suppress breast regrowth. A more severe case of virginal breast hypertrophy of an 11-year-old girl was reported in 2008. The breasts had begun to grow rapidly at puberty and had reached the point of causing physical impairment and respiratory compromise after one year. The skin was intact without any ulcerations. Blood chemistry and endocrine investigation was normal. A bilateral reduction mammaplasty with free nipple grafts was performed. Six kg of the right breast and 6.5 kg of the left breast were removed, resulting in a removal of 12.5 kg of tissue in all (24% of the total body weight).

Previously, it was an independent town. History Sadhora is located in Bukovina, a region which was part of the Principality of Moldavia until the 1770s when it was conquered by the Habsburg Monarchy, becoming part of the Duchy of Bukovina under the Austrian Empire starting in 1849, then becoming an Austrian \\"crownland\\" from 1867 until the end of World War I, after which it was ruled by Romania for two decades (1918-1940). Austrian stamp and cancellation before 1860 Sadhora was established in 1770 by a former Saxon and Polish official, Baron :de:Peter Nicolaus von Gartenberg (1714-1786). During the Russo-Turkish War, 1768-1774, the commander-in-chief of the Russian army in Moldavia and Wallachia took measures to enhance the economic and monetary system in the principalities. Therefore, a mint was established in a formerly wooded area by a river, by a man with previous experience in this field, Baron Gartenberg, Slavic Sadh√≥ra being a literal translation of the German \\"Gartenberg\\", \\"garden mountain.\\" Beginning in 1771, the coins that were minted at Sadhora displayed the coats of arms of both Moldavia and Wallachia on the same side. The mint was closed down at the end of the war, in 1774. Jewish history Hasidic synagogue in Sadag√≥ra. Sadag√≥ra had a significant Jewish community and it is important in the history of Hasidic Judaism. Before World War I, the Jewish population numbered over 5,000. Rabbi Yisroel Friedman, the Ruzhiner Rebbe, relocated his court to Sadag√≥ra in 1842. In 1838 he had been accused of complicity in the death of two Jews accused of being informers and was imprisoned for two years by the Russian authorities. On his release he fled to Kishinev, then to Ia≈üi and other places before finally settling in Sadag√≥ra in 1842, where he re-established his Hasidic court in all its glory. Palace of the Ruzhin dynasty in Sadhora The Ruzhiner Rebbe lived in Sadag√≥ra for ten years, building a palatial home and a large synagogue. Tens of thousands of Hasidim frequented his court.Friedman, Yisroel. The Golden Dynasty: Ruzhin, the royal house of Chassidus. Jerusalem: The Kest-Lebovits Jewish Heritage and Roots Library, 2nd English edition, 2000, p. 15. When he died at the age of 54 on 9 October 1850, each of his sons moved to different towns to establish their own courts. His eldest son, Rabbi Sholom Yosef Friedman, remained in Sadag√≥ra to continue leading the court his father had founded, but died ten months later. At this point, the second sonFriedman, The Golden Dynasty, p. 20. of the Ruzhiner Rebbe, Rabbi Avrohom Yaakov Friedman, assumed the mantle of leadership of the Sadigura Hasidim, becoming known as the first Sadigura Rebbe.Friedman, The Golden Dynasty, pp. 15-17. After his death, his second son, Rabbi Yisrael Friedman (1852-1907), succeeded him as Rebbe. He, in turn, was succeeded by his eldest son, Rabbi Aharon of Sadigura (1877-1913), and by another son, Rabbi Avrohom Yaakov Friedman, who escaped to Vienna with the outbreak of World War I in 1914 and established his court in that city for the next 24 years,Friedman, The Golden Dynasty, pp. 38-39. effectively putting an end to the once-flourishing Jewish community in Sadag√≥ra . The remaining Jews of Sadag√≥ra were decimated by the Nazis during World War II.

It is the sole member of its genus, and the only freshwater surfperch. The tule perch is small, at most in length, and deep-bodied, with a definite hump shape between the head and the dorsal fin. Color is variable, with a dark back that may have a bluish or purplish cast, and a whitish or yellowish belly. The sides may have a pattern of narrow or wide bars; the frequency of barred patterns varies according to subspecies. The dorsal fin has a noticeable ridge of scales running along its base, and consists of 15-19 spines followed by 9-15 soft rays. The anal fin has three spines and 20-16 soft rays, while the pectoral fins have 17-19 rays. They are fish of the lowlands, inhabiting lakes, sloughs, streams, and rivers, generally in areas with beds of vegetation or overhangs. They generally gather in groups, sometimes in large numbers. Their diet is primarily small invertebrates sucked up from the bottom or picked from the midwater column. The two subspecies of tule perch recognized by FishBase are: * Hysterocarpus traskii traskii Gibbons, 1854, the Russian River tule perch, originally occurred throughout Clear Lake, the Russian River, the Sacramento River-San Joaquin River and out into the estuaries around San Francisco Bay and the Pajaro River-Salinas River drainages. It is still common as far north as the Pit River, although it has mostly disappeared from the San Joaquin basin. The only unbarred fish occur in this subspecies, about 43% existing in this color pattern. * Hysterocarpus traskii pomo Hopkirk, 1974 is found in the Central Valley drainages. The formal description of the tule perch was first read by W. P. Gibbons at a meeting of the California Academy of Natural Sciences on May 15, 1854, and then published in the San Francisco newspaper The Daily Placer Times and Transcript on May 18, making it a rare case of a new species being published in a newspaper rather than book or scientific journal. Gibbons chose the genus name Hysterocarpus \\"womb-fruit\\" referring to the livebearing common to all surfperches. The specific name honours John B. Trask (1824-1879), who was a friend of William P. Gibbons and was a physician and amateur geologist, he was also a founding member of the California Academy of Sciences. References * * Peter B.

On October 5, 2007, Puma TV was taken off the air and replaced by Canal i, a 24-hour news channel. History Puma TV was founded as Bravo TV by singer and actor Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez Gonz√°lez (also known as \\"El Puma\\") in 1995. Shortly after it went on the air, Bravo TV's name was changed to Puma TV because the name already belonged to a Canadian cable television network. In 1998, the network raised the amount of original productions from 16 to 20 and expanded their over-the-air coverage to all of Venezuela. Due to economic problem, towards the end of its existence, Puma TV was only seen over-the-air in the cities of Caracas and Maracaibo. After the 2002-2003 Venezuelan general strike, Puma TV suffered a severe economic crisis that resulted in a 60-day shut down in mid-2003. This measure obligated Puma TV's investors to put the network up for sale, which resulted in its purchase by the Uni√≥n Radio Group (a corporation which also controlled the radio stations √âxitos, Onda La Mega Estaci√≥n, Uni√≥n Radio Noticias, and Uni√≥n Radio Deportes). The following year, Puma TV was purchased by a group of businessmen with the goal of transforming the Puma TV into a 24-hour news channel in order to compete with Globovisi√≥n. After much delay, Canal i (the proposed 24-hour news channel) went on the air on October 5, 2007, thus ending Puma TV's history.

Publication history Black Hand first appeared in Green Lantern (vol. 2) #29 (June 1964) and was created by John Broome and Gil Kane. The character's name is a tribute to DC writer and Batman co-creator Bill Finger,Rozakis, Bob. \\"Alter Egos And Alternate Earths\\" , Comics Bulletin, accessed February 3, 2011. on whom the character was based.Cronin, Brian. \\"Comic Book Legends Revealed #298\\", Comic Book Resources, accessed February 3, 2011. Fictional character biography William Hand is born an inventive genius; developing a penchant for speaking in extremely old clich√©s later in life. William's family, the Hands, are renowned in Coastville (a suburb of Coast City, California); however, he grows to dislike them early in life. He feels the best way to distance himself from them, especially his three brothers (David, Peter and Joe), is to start a life of crime. After extensive study, he becomes an expert criminal and evades police at every turn. Eventually, his criminal behavior escalates into becoming a costumed supervillain; dubbing himself \\"Black Hand\\" (an inside joke he conceives that refers to his status as the \\"black sheep\\" of the Hand family). In preparation for an inevitable battle with the Coast City-based Green Lantern (Hal Jordan), Hand makes his most noteworthy invention. The device he creates is able to absorb the residue of a Green Lantern power ring's energy from any object that it touches. Once fueled by this energy, his device can then be used much the same way as a Green Lantern ring. In one crime spree, he uses his device to persuade the general public the items he has stolen have, in fact, never been touched. Hand also tends to break the fourth wall, speaking directly to the reader about his plans to confront Hal Jordan. For a while, he retires from a life of crime and attempts to run an adult theatre. This new lease on life is ended abruptly by Guy Gardner and his girlfriend Ice. Black Hand develops a phobia of super-heroes. While trying to reorganize his life into more peaceful pursuits, he encounters Justice League members at the World Trade Center restaurant and has a mental breakdown.\\"Justice League of America\\" #51 (June 1991) Shortly before the events of Green Lantern: Rebirth, Black Hand's device locates a spare power ring that Green Arrow holds in case of emergency. Hand tries to claim the ring for himself, but is stopped by Green Arrow and Hal Jordan (who is serving as the current Spectre). As Hand attempts to wield the power ring, the emerald archer pins the villain's hand to the wall with an arrow and the Spectre turns his hand to coal; remarking that now \\"he can live up to his name\\".Green Lantern: Rebirth #1 Missing his right hand and insane from the trauma, Hand flees. After hearing of Hal Jordan's resurrection, he decides to live in the rebuilt Coast City in order to stay close to his foe. While on board an airplane, he is targeted and abducted by the Kroloteans, a race of mysterious German-speaking aliens that are akin to the gremlins of myth. They perform experiments that enhance his powers, and abandon him in a public park.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #5 (November 2005)Green Lantern (vol. 4) #6 (December 2005)Green Lantern (vol. 4) #43 (July 2009) He is seen in the Infinite Crisis mini-series as a member of Alexander Luthor, Jr.'s Secret Society of Super Villains and one of several heroes and villains observed by Kal-L and Superboy-Prime.Infinite Crisis #1Infinite Crisis #2 =Infinite Crisis origin= Black Hand origin was rewritten in the Secret Origin storyline of Green Lantern, and further enhanced in the Blackest Night storyline. In his updated origin, William Hand's parents run a coroner's office and funeral home, the logo of which is the same symbol William eventually adopts at the beginning of his criminal career. While still a young boy, Hand is shown as having a severe preoccupation with death and the dead that includes implied necrophilic tendencies. No particular trauma or event seems to have inspired this; even as a toddler, William is deeply fascinated by death and dead people, calling them \\"pretty\\". It is implied that his first kiss was with a corpse. At first William tries to control his urges by engaging in taxidermy; however, his hobby becomes a source of concern after he kills the family dog in pursuit of his favored pastime. From this point forward William is sent to various psychologists for the remainder of his life with the Hand family. William simply shrugs off every attempt to \\"cure\\" him, learning how to hide the most prurient manifestations of his necrophilia and accept the role of the \\"black sheep\\".Green lantern (vol. 4) #35 (October 2008) As part of his newly written background, his energy-absorbing weapon is now portrayed as being built by Atrocitus, a fervent enemy of the Guardians of the Universe. Atrocitus comes to Earth looking for the being who will coordinate the events that come to be known as the Blackest Night; that being is revealed to be William Hand. Atrocitus locates and attacks Hand, believing the black power literally lies within his body. Atrocitus is stopped by Green Lanterns Hal Jordan and Sinestro, while Hand (encouraged by a strange voice) pockets the weapon and flees the scene.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #34 (August 2008) He is later seen breaking into a hospital morgue, trying to steal one of the corpses there. When he is confronted by a security guard, he uses the weapon to kill him, after which saying to himself, the dead was good. The mysterious voice that tells Hand to steal Atrocitus' weapon for himself traps him under its thrall and influences him into resenting the Green Lanterns. As beacons of light, they upset the perfect balance of darkness and death. Trying to extinguish the light of willpower but unwilling to fight Green Lantern as an \\"average joe\\", Hand sews himself a costume using a family cadaver pouch and begins calling himself \\"Black Hand\\". Jordan apparently never connects William and his energy-absorbing weapon to his earlier fight with Atrocitus (believing it to be an original creation). Never revealing his weapon's true origin, Black Hand continues to fight him over the years, always retreating to a desecrated grave after each failure. There, he lies with the corpses, hoping for peace and release. =Blackest Night= While being transported to prison, Black Hand experienced a sudden power surge that killed his guards and began having visions of the dead planet Ryut and the Black Power Battery. After the visions he roams the desert, hearing \\"Death\\" calling to him. It instructs him to reclaim all the souls it has lost in the DC Universe, including Superman and Hal Jordan.DC Universe #0 (June 2009) Black Hand returns to his family's house, kills his two brothers, his mother, his father, and then finally commits suicide. While these events unfold, the Guardian Scar arrives at the Hand house. She pronounces that the self-sacrifice \\"pleases him\\" and regurgitates the first Black power ring, which reanimated Black Hand. She reveals that Hand is the physical embodiment of death, in the same manner that Ion is for willpower, Parallax is for fear, and the Predator is for love. Hand then announces that he will use his new power to finally extinguish the light. Black Hand later spies on Hal Jordan and the Flash as they pay their respects at the unmarked grave of Batman. After the two heroes depart, Black Hand digs up Batman's corpse and, speaking his own oath, begins the process of recruiting the deceased hero; While holding Bruce Wayne's skull, Black Hand tells the mysterious force behind the Black Lanterns (residing in Sector 666) that no one escapes death. He is later seen after Black Lanterns Elongated Man and Sue Dibny kill Carter Hall and Kendra Saunders. Hand enters the room and proclaims that Hawkman and Hawkgirl will not escape death this time. Two black rings fly out of Batman's skull and Hand commands the two fallen heroes, by name, to rise.Blackest Night #1 (July 2009) Black Hand is also present when the Spectre is taken over by a black ring, gloating to the assembled magic users (such as Blue Devil and Zatanna) that their powers are useless against his \\"lord's\\" might.Blackest Night #2 (August 2009) When the Black Lantern's power levels finally reach one hundred percent, the Black Power Battery teleports itself to the outskirts of Coast City, right on top of the Hand Mortuary. Black Hand watches in delight as Nekron finally rises, and more black rings recruit the bodies of the people who perished when Coast City was destroyed.Blackest Night #4 (October 2009) When Barry Allen attempts to attack Nekron, Black Hand steps in, using Batman's skull as an \\"emotional tether\\" to weaken the heroes, inspiring such an intense emotional reaction that Nekron is able to release a new wave of black rings to 'recruit' the resurrected, such as Superman, Wonder Woman and Green ArrowBlackest Night #5 (November 2009); Jordan and Allen only just escape the same fate when Allen takes them both two seconds into the future to disrupt the rings' connection to themBlackest Night #6 (December 2009) The Black Lantern Corps are ultimately defeated when the White Entity is used to convert several Black Lanterns into White Lanterns before bringing Black Hand back to life when a white ring attaches to him, reviving him and forcing him to regurgitate several white rings, freeing the Anti-Monitor and destroying Nekron's physical form due to Hand serving as Nekron's tether to this plane of existence. He is later seen held in captivity by the Indigo Tribe, chained to the tribe's trademark power staff.Blackest Night #8 (March 2010) From Blackest Night #2, a back-up feature entitled \\"The Book of the Black: The Burned-In Thoughts of William Hand\\" is shown, chronicling Black Hand's childhood memories, and his own personal opinions regarding each of the seven colors of the Emotional spectrum. In the end, his thoughts of the Indigo Tribe turn out to be a scream after his capture, hoping to be released from the Tribe's captivity; but much of the text is in the Tribe's language, thereby remaining indecipherable, except for a few names and four translated phrases. =Brightest Day= Black Hand is later revealed to be in an unknown location on Earth somewhat trapped inside of Proselyte, the compassion entity, as the members of the Indigo Tribe gather around them.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #56 (August 2010) When Indigo-1 and Black Hand confront Hal Jordan, Barry Allen, Sinestro, Saint Walker and Larfleeze, Black Hand explains that the ring has 'cured' him of William Hand's sickness. This prompts the others to realize that, with their rings, the Indigo Tribe cannot feel any emotion besides compassion. Hal implies that given Hand's role in the Blackest Night, other Indigo Tribe members may have committed evil deeds in the past. Although the Indigo Tribe offer to take the remaining emotional entities into protective custody, Hal rejects the offer, concluding that he cannot trust them in the search for the entities with this new information. Then the being responsible for abducting the emotional entities appears with Parallax, proclaiming that any who feel emotion cannot be trusted.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #60 (December 2010) =The New 52= Black Hand confronted the currently- imprisoned Hal Jordan on the Indigo Tribe homeworld, the Tribe having abducted Hal and Sinestro, now a Green Lantern once again, with the intention of converting Sinestro into one of the tribe.Green Lantern vol. 5 #7 (March 2012) With his ring depowered, Hal tricked Black Hand into manifesting the green energy of willpower and using him as a battery to recharge Hal's ring; however, the charge was still limited compared to what the ring would have been capable of if recharged normally.Green Lantern vol. 5 #8 (April 2012) Black Hand is freed when guardian Natromo destroys the Indigo Central Power Battery.Green Lantern vol. 5 #9 (May 2012) When the battery is restored, Black Hand's indigo ring tries to reach him; however, Black Hand kills himself rather than return to the Indigo Tribe. A Black Power Ring later emerges from his corpse, reviving him as a Black Lantern.Green Lantern vol. 5 #10 (June 2012) Following his reanimation, he returns to Earth and murders everyone in a Chinese food restaurant and then raises his family from the dead to \\"have dinner\\" with him. He lays out his plan to kill and reanimate as many people as possible, reanimating his victims as undead murderers. Meanwhile, Sinestro takes Hal Jordan to the Book of the Black to reveal the plan of the Guardians of the Universe to replace the Green Lanterns Corps; however, as he opens the Book, Sinestro and Hal Jordan are sucked into it and drawn to Black Hand.Green Lantern vol. 5 #11 (July 2012) Although Hal and Sinestro are able to destroy Black Hand's makeshift army of reanimated corpses by detonating Sinestro's old yellow power battery, they are unaware that Black Hand has witnessed a new prophecy in the Book of the Black: Hal Jordan will become the greatest Black Lantern.Green Lantern vol. 5 #12 (August 2012) After trying to reanimate Hal's father, Black Hand is on the verge of being defeated by both Hal Jordan and Sinestro. The Guardians intervene, charging him up - which apparently grants him enough power to kill both his adversaries - before teleporting him in the Chamber of Shadows for unknown purposes \\"until he is needed\\".Green Lantern Annual #1 (August 2012) When Black Hand was imprisoned in the Chamber of Shadows, he reanimated the elder Oan (who was killed by the Guardians) for information about where the Guardians have put him in, but is only told that the First Lantern is a danger for the universe.Green Lantern (vol. 5) #14 (November 2012) Later, Green Lanterns Simon Baz and B'dg are sucked into the Book of Black and drawn to Black Hand.Green Lantern Corps Annual #1 (January 2013) When they began battling Black Hand, he sends Simon to the Dead Zone where Hal and Sinestro are trapped.Green Lantern vol. 5 #17 (February 2013) Green Lantern B'dg and the elder Oans subdue him to use his black ring to open a door to the Dead Zone in order to rescue Simon, but Sinestro unintentionally went with him, while Black Hand has vanished into the Dead Zone.Green Lantern vol. 5 #18 (March 2013) Hal soon makes the ultimate sacrifice by killing himself in order to harness the power of the black ring to escape the Dead Zone and stop the First Lantern Volthoom.Green Lantern vol. 5 #19 (April 2013) When the power ring turns Hal into a Black Lantern, Black Hand's body disintegrates into dust.Green Lantern vol. 5 #20 (May 2013) Some time later, a black ring was able to revive Black Hand back on Earth once again, albeit in a slightly vulnerable state. Yet with the heroes of the world missing or dead, Black Hand wandered through the city as it is engulfed in riots, raising up dead people as zombies. Blaming Hal Jordan for all that happened to him, he finally makes his vendetta against the Green Lantern a lot more personal as he goes to the place where Hal's father, Martin Jordan, is buried and raises him and all the corpses in the cemetery. Black Hand removes one of his own hands and takes one of Martin's hand in its place, hoping to kill Hal Jordan with his father's own hand.Green Lantern #23.3 Following the Forever Evil storyline, Black Hand raises a dead circus and raises the dead crowds to watch the stunt performers die. Hal Jordan interferes, but is not here to fight him and asks to ally themselves against the New Gods of New Genesis.Green Lantern vol. 5 #36 (November 2014) Hal Jordan explains that New Genesis has stolen the entire Power rings for a weapon as the Life Equation for their pursuit. Black Hand agrees to aid him and sends the dead people to return to their graves. In the battle, Black Hand unleashes the spirits of the fallen Green Lanterns to the ensuing battle against the New Genesis soldiers that occurs near the Source Wall. Black Hand stops the battle as the New Genesis soldiers surrounded them. He smirks to see the Source Wall was a mass grave.Green Lantern vol. 5 #37 (December 2014) Black Hand reanimates the grave of the Source Wall to attack the New Genesis soldiers. Black Hand then enters the Boom Tube to invade New Genesis' homeworld. Suddenly, Black Hand's powers were being effected with the horde of the Source Wall that are being subsequently resurrected by the leader of New Genesis, Highfather, and his misuse of the Life Equation and his arms were being turned to stone. He blames Hal for his plight and fled to deep space via the Boom Tube.Green Lantern Annual vol. 5 #3 (December 2014) In the aftermath, Black Hand was unable to raise the dead due to effects of the Source Wall.Green Lantern vol. 5, #42 (July 2015) Black Hand arrives on an alien planet, turning everything he touched to stone.Green Lantern vol. 5, #43 (August 2015) Black Hand becomes lonely when Hal arrives to confront him but Black Hand still blaming Hal for his plight, attacks the rogue Green Lantern, however using his power Gauntlet, Hal manages to defeat him as Black Hand's stone touch is ineffective against it.Green Lantern vol. 5, #45 (October 2015) Hal returns to the Source Wall with Black Hand and asks Relic, who had been studying the Source Wall, to find a way to undo Black Hand's power effects from the Source Wall. Relic reveals that there is something outward of the Source Wall that it can consume of any stone material to return to its origin. When Black Hand is awake and attacks them, but he is getting hit back with a huge grappling hook sending him to the Source Wall by Hal's colleagues on the spaceship. Black Hand is not through, but the Source Wall dragged him to it and he tried to reach out as the Source Wall consumes Black Hand.Green Lantern vol. 5, #46 (November 2015) =Rebirth= Black Hand was apparently released from the Source Wall when the latter was broken as he was seen back on Earth and built the Dark Church of the Black Hand, a cult that worships Death. They began kidnapping children in Opal City which eventually drew the attention of the Flash. Barry would track the cult just in time to prevent them from summoning Nekron by sacrificing one of the missing kids. He then easily defeated and delivered Black Hand to Iron Heights.The Flash #67 Powers and abilities =Energy device= Black Hand possesses a device that can manipulate the energy of Green Lantern power rings. It can obtain this energy by directly draining it from a ring or through the residue a power ring gives off. Like power rings, however, the device needs to replenish its energy on a regular basis in order to operate. Hand usually recharges his device during battles with Green Lanterns and has been shown to use it in order to help him locate nearby power rings. The device was recently revealed as being Atrocitus' creation, though it was previously assumed that he invented it himself. In Secret Origin, this device was quoted as being a cosmic divining rod, designed by Atrocitus to locate William Hand and defend himself against Green Lantern interference. =Black power ring= After his suicide, Black Hand is reanimated by Scar when she releases the first Black power ring, making him the first Black Lantern. Reanimated by the ring, the head injury he inflicts upon himself during his suicide is erased, restoring his body to a working state.Montgomery, Lauren (Director). Johns, Geoff (Commentator) (2009). Green Lantern: First Flight (Behind the Scenes of Blackest Night). [Animated Film/DVD]. Warner Home Video. Warner Bros Animation. DC Comics. When the first Black power rings choose wearers, they present themselves to the deceased without a charge. The rings (which constantly ask for \\"flesh\\") are recharged by killing living beings and removing their hearts; each heart restores .01 percent power to every ring in the Corps.SDCC 09: Blackest Night Consumes Comic-Con, IGN, July 25, 2009 Black Lanterns are also able to read the emotions of the living as a colored aura that correlates to the emotional spectrum (red for rage, violet for love, etc.). =Indigo power ring= After he had been restored to life, Black Hand is converted to the Indigo Tribe whose power ring allows Black Hand to perceive compassion in others and to force compassion onto those who feel none.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #48 (November 2009)Blackest Night (vol. 1) #3 (September 2009) Indigo light has the ability to heal individuals with great empathy and to expose people to pain that they have inflicted on other people. Indigo Power Rings can teleport their users and others over intergalactic distances. This ability utilizes a great deal of power from an indigo power ring, and Indigo Tribe members try to use it sparingly.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #46 (September 2009) Eventually he loses this ability and starts wearing a black ring again. Other versions =Flashpoint= In the alternate timeline of the Flashpoint storyline, William Hand is killed by Atrocitus to unleash Nekron in the process.Flastpoint: Abin Sur - The Green Lantern #1 (June 2011) In other media =Video games= * Black Hand appears in DC Universe Online, voiced by Gray Haddock. * Black Hand appears as a playable character in Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham, voiced by Liam O'Brien.

He then became the Radio and Television Officer to Archbishop Michael Ramsey, remaining in the post until 1972. He was then vicar of St Matthew's Fulham until 1978 and then, fatefully, vicar of St Mary's Ealing (1978‚Äì91). He also became president of the House of Clergy of the Willesden Area Synod. Until his retirement at the end of 2000 he was Canon Treasurer of St Paul's Cathedral in London. In the mid-1980s he was an object of attacks by the magazine Private Eye, to which his replies elicited more attacks. On 6 March 1986, a gang of burglars broke into the Saward family's home at lunchtime. Saward and his daughter Jill's then-boyfriend, David Kerr, were tied up and beaten, both suffering fractured skulls, while Jill (who died in 2017) was raped. Jill became an author and campaigner for victims of rape and sexual violence. She was the first rape victim in England to waive anonymity.\\"Why I am the real victim of the Ealing vicarage rape\\", Daily Mail, 3 August 1998. Canon Saward served on many councils and committees, among which were the General Synod (1975‚Äì1995), the Church Commissioners (1978‚Äì93) and the Church of England's Evangelical Council (1976‚Äì93). He served as Chairman of the Billy Graham London Mission 1989 Media Task Group, a judge of The Times \\"Preacher of the Year\\" competition in 2000 and as religious adviser to the film Cromwell (1970). Author Saward began writing pamphlets about different aspects of church life in the 1960s, mainly for Scripture Union, before embarking on books such as Don't Miss the Party (1974) and the controversial And So To Bed? (1975), which examined Christian views about sex. This was followed by Cracking the God Code (1978), God's Friends: Romans (1978) and All Change (1983). In later years Saward concentrated on writing hymns, contributing to many hymn books and editing Come Celebrate, a compilation of modern hymn writing, in 2009. Saward's autobiography, A Faint Streak of Humility, was published in 1999. =Hymn writer= Saward wrote over a hundred hymns, of which \\"Christ triumphant, ever reigning\\" is his best known, usually sung to the hymn tune \\"Guiting Power\\" (named after the village of Guiting Power in Gloucestershire) by John Barnard. A long-term member of the Jubilate Group of hymnwriters, Saward was also its chairman from 1999 to 2001. Saward was an active member of the Hymn Society of Great Britain and Ireland, serving on its executive committee. Later life Though retired from the church appointments, Saward continued to minister. He was granted a permission to officiate in the Diocese of London from 2002 and in the Diocese of Rochester from 2013. At the time of his death, he had preached in hundreds of churches across the world, including the United States, on the Queen Elizabeth 2 cruise ship and twice at the Tower of London. Death On 31 January 2015, Canon Saward was found dead in his room at a hotel in Switzerland by staff members. He was 82 years old. Personal life Canon Saward was married to Jacqueline Atkinson (1932‚Äì2009) and was the father of Rachel, Joe (a Formula One motorsport journalist), Jill (died 2017) and Sue (Jill and Sue were twins). Canon Saward was also a holder of a Winston Churchill Travelling Fellowship, a Freeman of the City of London and a member of the Athenaeum Club, London. Saward's grandfather was Henry George Kendall, the first person to use radio to capture a criminal; he recognised the murderer, Hawley Harvey Crippen, who was attempting to escape the UK on Kendall's liner.

It inhabits rainforest and wet sclerophyll forest of the coast and ranges. Description This is medium-sized frog, getting to about 50mm in length. It is brown on the dorsal surface, however can range from light tan to dark or red brown. Its skin is rough in texture and feels like sandpaper. There are raised skin folds that run down the frogs back and a distinct triangle of lighter brown on the frogs head (between the eyes and snout). There is a dark line that starts at the nostril, extends through the eye and curves around the tympanum. There are crossbands on the legs, this may cause confusion with similar looking Mixophyes frogs. The toes and fingers are both free of webbing. Ecology and behaviour Lechriodus fletcheri tadpole This species inhabits rainforest and wet sclerophyll forest. It is very active after heavy rains in summer and is rarely seen in drier conditions. Males make a short gar-r-r-up call from leaf litter around temporary pools and small streams. Up to 650 eggs are laid in a foamy mass and tadpoles are notoriously cannibalistic. These frogs camouflage very well with leaf litter and can be very difficult to find if they are not active. Sources *Frogs Australia Network-frog call available here. *Anstis, M. 2002.

It was intended for the Smile album until the project was shelved. It was then released on their 1969 album 20/20 with additional production by the Beach Boys without involvement from Wilson. As a solo artist, Wilson rerecorded and released the piece on his 2004 version of Smile in medley with the 1953 doo-wop standard \\"Gee\\". Professors John Covach and Graeme M. Boone have written: \\"An exquisite exercise of harmonic virtuousity, 'Our Prayer' allowed the Beach Boys once again to show off their vocal abilities and stylistic influences earlier demonstrated on such songs as 'Their Hearts Were Full of Spring'.\\" Composition The wordless, a cappella piece was originally supposed to be the opening track to the Smile album. As Beach Boys historian Peter Reum explained, \\"Brian intended for 'Our Prayer' to be the opening track, a spiritual invocation, for 'Smile'.\\" The title may be a reference to the 1939 traditional pop standard \\"My Prayer\\", written by Georges Boulanger and Jimmy Kennedy. As music journalist Paul Williams elaborates, Wilson was to quickly record and get it over with as soon as possible so he could focus on recording the bulk of Smile for the January, 1967 release that he had promised Capitol Records. However, Smile was abandoned, and the track lay dormant for several months. The song was eventually released together with \\"Cabinessence\\" on their 1969 album 20/20, albeit with some added vocal overdubs. The main vocals were recorded in late 1966 with the additional vocals being recorded at Capitol Records Studios two years later. Live performances The Beach Boys never performed the song live until their 50th anniversary reunion tour; at the June 24, 2012 show, \\"Our Prayer\\" was performed as an intro to \\"Heroes and Villains\\", however it was only performed several times.

Intended for the discarded album Smile, it was not released until 1969 for the album 20/20. The subject of the song is said by Wilson to be \\"about railroads,\\" as he intended to encapsulate the image of Chinese laborers pounding rail spikes while their minds go \\"off on a different track\\" after noticing a crow flying overhead. According to journalist Nick Kent, the song \\"juxtaposed both highly-advanced Western and Eastern musical references\\" with an \\"oriental presence\\", making use of the banjo and harmonica as well as percussion in the chorus designed to emulate the sound of workers assembling train tracks. \\"Cabinessence\\" has received much acclaim over the years as the stand-out track on 20/20. Biographer Jon Stebbins observed the song's \\"demonic chanting\\" which he believed exemplified \\"some of the most haunting, manic, evil-sounding music the Beach Boys ever made\\". MOJO described Cabinessence as \\"Smile in microcosm. Vast in scope, unprecedented in its ambition and as much an unsolved sonic riddle as the album it had been written for, this was the misunderstood masterpiece that caused Mike Love to crack and the project to flounder.\\" Lyricism Brian Wilson stated that he and Van Dyke Parks wrote the song along with \\"Heroes and Villains\\", \\"Wonderful\\" and \\"Surf's Up\\" in a giant sandbox with a piano in it that Wilson had built in his living room. \\"Cabinessence\\" was one of a number of Smile tracks which contained lyrics that the other band members did not approve of, being infamously oblique and replete with wordplay. The seemingly-surreal couplet of the closing \\"Grand Coulee Dam\\" section are as follows, If the listener rearranges the last half of each line, they get \\"over and over the crow cries and hovers the wheatfield / over and over the thresher uncovers the cornfield\\", which makes them clearer. Parks penned additional lyrics to Cabinessence not heard on any official release, nor bootlegged. They are unknown to have ever been recorded during tracking sessions. Clarifying the song's historical references, Parks says: Recording and structure The song has three distinct sections: \\"Home on the Range\\", \\"Who Ran the Iron Horse\\", and \\"The Grand Coulee Dam\\" in the form of ABABC. \\"Home on the Range\\" may be seen as the verse, and \\"Who Ran the Iron Horse\\" as the chorus. While \\"Home on the Range\\" is in 4/4, or \\"common time\\", \\"Who Ran the Iron Horse\\" is a waltz. \\"The Grand Coulee Dam\\" is in 3/4 time as well. The chorus features the repeated line, \\"Who ran the Iron Horse?\\" over \\"aah\\" harmonies in mixolydian mode, and patterned to an I7‚ÄîV7 progression in the implied key of F major. In the second iteration of this section, there are barely-audible lyrics sung by Dennis Wilson underneath the harmonies. In 1969, Brian Wilson wrote: Musician Mark Johnson refers to the banjo in \\"Cabinessence\\" as \\"traditionally the Great American folk instrument,\\" with it being used \\"like part of the soundtrack to a lost Twilight Zone episode,\\" and that the song \\"could be an exploration a la John Steinbeck of what American music's function really is. To simply fill a room, while we go about our days and nights.\\" The track was largely mixed and completed in December 1966, lacking only a lead vocal and a coherent structure. An alternate work-in- progress version was described by friend and Smile participant Michael Vosse in 1969. Dennis Wilson sings a heavily syncopated vocal rap during the song's second chorus. He says, \\"I got off so much on doing that. It's mixed way down in the track, and it‚Äôs syncopated all the way through. Right there is my biggest turn-on.\\" The lines are: \\"Truck-driving man, do what you can. / High- tail your load off the road, out of night-life. / It's a gas, man. I don‚Äôt believe I gotta grieve. / In and out of luck with a buck and a booth. / Catching on to the truth, in the vast past, the last gasp. / In the land, in the dust, trust that you must catch as catch can.\\" =Conflict= A recording session for \\"The Grand Coulee Dam\\" vocal overdubs on December 6, 1966 reportedly saw tensions within the band boil over when Love was instructed by Wilson to sing the song's lyrics. Bemused, Love demanded that Wilson call lyricist Parks to the recording session to explain the meaning of the coda line \\"Over and over, the crow cries, uncover the cornfield. Over and over, the thresher and hovers, the wheatfield\\". Wilson complied, and asked Parks if he was willing to come down to the studio to sort out Love's complaints. Upon arriving at the studio, Love questioned the lyrics reportedly in an aggressive fashion. Unable to come up with an answer that satisfied Love and unwilling to be drawn into an argument about the quality of his work, Parks responded by simply stating he didn't know the meaning of the lyric. Consequently, Parks left the session feeling as though he was intruding on a family feud with roots and motivations that had nothing to do with him, and would eventually leave the project in the spring of 1967. Some consider this to have doomed the album. Defending himself in later years, Love has rebutted: During the 1990s, Love reportedly asked Parks about the lyrics again. According to Parks, \\"I was able to tell him, once again, 'I don‚Äôt know.' I have no idea what those words mean. I was perhaps thinking of Van Gogh's wheat field or an idealized agrarian environment. Maybe I meant nothing, but I was trying to follow Brian Wilson's vision at that time.\\" =20/20 mixing= In April 1969, Vosse stated: \\"The recording of it on 20/20 is new, because before his ear operation about a year ago, Brian could not hear in stereo.\\" Although the final Smile version would have most likely been released in monoaural sound, the track was eventually released in stereo as \\"Cabinessence\\" on their 1969 album 20/20, with a lead vocal overdub by Carl Wilson recorded on November 20, 1968. It was met with interest and praise upon its release in 1969 following \\"Our Prayer\\" due to its roots in the much publicized Smile project three years earlier.

Also known as \\"Ahavamalla\\" or \\"Trilokamalla\\", Someshvara succeeded his father Jayasimha II to the throne. His several military successes in Central India made him a formidable ruler of a vast empire. During his rule, the Chalukyan empire extended to Gujarat and Central India in the north. The Hoysalas of the Malenadu (hill) regions of Mysore were his vassals in the South. Vinayaditya's daughter or sister called Hoysala Devi was one of his queens. In the west, Someshvara I retained control over the Konkan. In the east he was able to extend his influence up to Ananthapur and Kurnool. Despite many defeats during his wars with the Cholas of Tanjore, he managed to play king-maker at Vengi on several occasions.Kamath (1980), p.104, p.124 According to the historian Ganguli, the Cholas \\"could not wrest from him any part of his kingdom\\". According to the historian Sen, Someshvara I's rule was a \\"brilliant period\\" in the history of the Western Chalukyas that would reach its zenith under Vikramaditya VI.Sen (1999), p.384 Historian Tripathi claims the Chalukya influence was felt in far-off Eastern India as well. He shifted his capital from Manyakheta to Kalyani (present day Basavakalyana in modern Bidar district).Kamath (1980), p.103 He patronized the Kannada language scholar Shridharacharya who wrote Jatakatilaka (c.1049), the earliest available work on astrology in the language, and the now extinct Chandraprabhacharite on Belles-lettres (kavya kavite).Narasimhacharya (1988), p.19 Wars with the Cholas According to the historian Kamath, soon after his coronation, Someshvara I interfered in the affairs of Vengi and invaded the region but faced defeat against the Chola monarch Rajadhiraja Chola (crowned in c.1044) at Amaravathi. The Cholas followed this by invading Chalukya territory. According to the historian Sastri, Rajadhiraja defeated Someshvara I in the battle of Dannada (\\"Dhanyakataka\\") on the banks of the Krishna river compelling the Western Chalukya armies to retreat, and the fort at Kollipakki (Kulpak) was razed to the ground. This was followed by victories at Kampili and Pundur. According to the historians Chopra et al., the details of the sack of Kampili is recorded in the Manimangalam inscription. A victory pillar with the Chola emblem was installed at Yetagiri (modern Yadgir in the Yadgir district). Finally, the Cholas plundered Kalyani, the Chalukya capital in c.1045. Rajadhiraja performed the Virabhisheka (\\"victory celebration\\") in the destroyed enemy capital and assumed the title Vijayarajendra (\\"victorious Rajendra\\"). However, according to Sastri and Sen, in a dramatic recovery, Someshvara I drove the Cholas out of Vengi by c.1050 and re-established his influence, not only in Vengi but also in Kalinga (modern day Orissa). Sen further claims Someshvara I took the battle right to the heart of the Chola empire. According to Kamath there was a Chalukya counterattack and a raid on Kanchipuram.Chopra, Ravindran and Subrahmanian (2003), p.138 For a while the Cholas did not press their cause either in Vengi or Kalinga. However, in c.1054, the Cholas responded by invading Koppal (Koppam) where King Rajadhiraja Chola was killed and Someshvara I had to mourn the death of his brother Jayasimha. However, according to Sastri, the Cholas were able to convert defeat into victory when their crown prince Rajendra II (brother of Rajadhiraja) mounted a surprise counterattack and pushed the Chalukya armies back. Rajendra II crowned himself on the battlefield, mounted a victory pillar at Kollapura (modern Kohlapur) and returned to his capital Gangaikondacholapuram with much booty which including the Chalukya queens Sattiyavvai and Sangappai. Hostilities continued and in c.1059 Rajendra Chola II invaded the Chalukya kingdom but was defeated on the banks of the Tungabhadra river. Someshvara I constructed a temple at Annigeri in the modern Dharwad district to celebrate this success. However, according to Sen, in the battle of Mudakkarru on the banks of the Tungabhadra in c.1059, Someshvara I suffered another defeat.Sastri (1955), pp.168-169 Politics of succession erupted again over the Vengi throne in c.1061 after the death of the Eastern Chalukya King Rajaraja Narendra. Someshvara I installed Saktivarman II, son of Vijayaditya II, on the throne. This went against the wishes of the Cholas who wanted their own blood line from the Vengi family at the helm. The Cholas desired to crown Rajendra, son of the deceased king Rajaraja Narendra. There was a brief respite for Someshvara I over Vengi affairs but the new Chola monarch Rajendra II appears to have defeated Someshvara I in several encounters, including in a major battle at Kudalasangama (modern Koodli in the Shimoga district) in c.1062. The historians Chopra et al., claim this Kudalasangama was actually at the confluence of Krishna and Tungabhadra rivers. On this occasion, Someshvara I had sent two armies, one under his general Chamundaraya and another into Gangavadi (southern Mysore territory) under his sons prince Vikramaditya VI and Jayasimha. However, Rajendra II defeated both armies and thus Someshvara I's effort to erase the defeat at Koppal failed. In c.1063, Rajendra II and his son Rajamahendra died leading to the coronation of Virarajendra as the new Chola king. =Final battle of Kudalasangama= During a brief lull in hostilities, Someshvara I was busy reinforcing himself, militarily and diplomatically. In the east he counted on the Nagavamsi ruler Dharavarsha and the Eastern Ganga dynasty King Vajrahasta II of Kalinga as his allies. In Bezwada, he relied on the support of the Paramara dynasty prince Janannatha. In the west he stationed a large army under Vijayaditya. After a few brief encounters with the Cholas including a successful Chalukya raid of the Chola capital by prince Vikarmaditya VI, Someshvara I invited Virarajendra Chola to a battle at Kudalasangama. However, because of an incurable illness that afflicted him, Someshvara I's and his army did not show up at the venue. After a month-long wait Virarajendra invaded and was victorious at all fronts: Vengi, Bezwada, Kalinga and Chitrakuta (in the Nagavamsi domains), and a victory pillar was erected on the banks of the Tungabhadra. Unable to recover from his illness, Someshvara I committed ritual suicide (paramayoga) by drowning himself in the Tungabhadra river at Kuruvatti (modern Bellary district) on 29 March 1068.Kamath (1980), p.104Sastri (1955), p.170 Success in the central and eastern India During this time of constant conflict with the Cholas, according to Kamath and Sastri, Someshvara I dealt successfully with the Shilaharas of the North Konkan, the Seuna (Yadava) dynasty King Bhillama III, the Paramara dynasty King Bhoja of Dhara, the Chaulukyas of Gujarat and the Pratiharas of central India. Someshvara I plundered Dhar, Ujjain and Mandapa in central India and subjugated King Bhoja. The Chindaka Nagas of Bastar (the Nagavamsi dynasty of Chitrakuta) in central India were defeated by the Chalukya vassal Kakatiya dynasty King Prolla. According to Chopra et al., Someshvara I got the better of King Lakshmikarna of the Kalachuri dynasty of Tripuri (nearJabalpur) as well. Thus Someshvara I's control extended as far north as Vidharba and parts of modern Madhya Pradesh.Kamath (1980), p.104Sastri (1955), pp.167-168 According to the historian Tripathi, toward the end of his reign, under the leadership of his brilliant son Vikramaditya VI, Someshvara I's armies marched east with an eye on the Gangetic plains. Unchecked by the Chandala rulers and the Kacchapaghata rulers of central India, according to the Yewur inscription, Someshvara I's armies raided Kanyakubja whose king appears to have fled based on this line in the inscription: \\"quickly experiences an abode among the caves\\". The Chalukya armies marched further east, overwhelming the Kalachuri King Lakshmikarna of Madhyadesha and getting the better of the kingdoms of Mithila, Magadha, Anga, Vanga and Gouda. The Palas appear to have posed no resistance either. Eventually, Someshvara's I armies were stopped by King Ratnapala of Kamarupa (in modern Assam). The Chalukya armies returned home through Southern Kosla.Tripathi (1942), pp.421-422  Notes  References    Category:1068 deaths Category:Western Chalukya Empire Category:Suicides by drowning ","title":"Someshvara I"},{"id":"4820145","text":"Christopher I of Baden (13 November 1453 ‚Äì 19 April 1527) was the Margrave of Baden from 1475 to 1515.  Life  Christoph was the eldest son of Charles I, Margrave of Baden-Baden and Catherine of Austria, a sister of Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor. He regained the territories that were lost by his father to the Palatinate and its allies. Christoph maneuvered to keep these territories united under his son and successor Philip I, but his efforts were thwarted by Louis XII of France. In 1479, the seat of the Margraviate of Baden was moved from Hohenbaden Castle to New Castle (') of Baden-Baden which was built by him. In 1489 Christoph became a member of the Swabian League. This was part of his efforts for peaceful coexistence with his neighbors (in particular with W√ºrttemberg and the cities of Weil and Strasbourg). Within the protection of this South West German pact, Christoph advanced the internal development of his dominion. Christoph Markgraf von Baden's winegrowing law of 1495 was a major step in improving the quality of wine produced in Baden.\\"... The House of Baden, which has held the title of margrave since 1112, is closely associated with the development of quality winegrowing in Baden. In 1495, the margraves enacted the first wine laws. In the 18th century, they adopted single-variety Riesling cultivation and introduced Chasselas grapes in the southern Baden district of Markgr√§flerland. Similarly, in 1923 the M√ºller- Thurgau grape variety was first cultivated at Lake Constance on the family‚Äôs estates. Schloss Salem on Lake Constance is the ancestral home of the House of Baden and the headquarters of its vineyard estate.

By 1503, Christoph was responsible for uniting all the Badener lands when the Baden-Sausenberg died without male heirs. In 1515, before his death, he divided the Margraviate among his sons Philipp, Bernhard, and Ernst. However, Philipp who had succeeded him died childless, and his share was passed down to his brothers Bernhard and Ernst.

An advertisement for \\"Amstel super Stout\\" from 1922 Amstel Brewery (, ) is a Dutch brewery founded in 1870 on the Mauritskade in Amsterdam. It was taken over by Heineken International in 1968, and the brewing plant closed down in 1982, with production moving to the main Heineken plant at Zoeterwoude. History The brewery was founded by Charles Antoine de Pesters (1842-1915), Johannes Hendrikus van Marwijk Kooy (1847-1916) and Willem Eduard Uhlenbroek (1839-1880). De Pesters and Van Marwijk Kooy were brothers-in-law, both coming from very affluent Amsterdam families. Uhlenbroek's father owned a small sugar refinery in Amsterdam. The brewery was named after the Amstel River. The brewery's symbolic first stone was laid on 11 June 1870. The first brew was completed on 25 October 1871 and two-and-a- half months later, on 9 January 1872, the first beer was delivered to clients. The brewery was officially opened on 15 January 1872.Peter Zwaal, The history of De Amstel Brouwerij since 1870 (Amsterdam : Bas Lubberhuizen, 2010) p.14-15. At this time its annual brewing capacity was 10,000 hectoliters (220,000 imp gallons). For the purpose of storing the beer, winter ice from canals was kept in special double-walled cellars. Originally, Amstel beers were mostly drunk in Amsterdam. The expansion outside Amsterdam ran more or less parallel to the development of the Dutch railway network. Agents were appointed in towns along new railway lines. As from 1883, Amstel beers were also exported to Great Britain and the Dutch East Indies. In 1884 a special export bottling plant was built, where \\"tropical\\" beers for the Dutch East Indies and other overseas markets were pasteurised and packaged in metal kegs. On 1 January 1891 the firm De Pesters, Kooy & Co. operating under the name Beiersch Bierbrouwerij De Amstel (Bavarian Beer Brewery De Amstel), was turned into a public limited company. In 1915 the production of Amstel had increased twenty-fold and in 1926, Amstel consisted of a third of the Dutch beer exports. In 1941, Amstel, together with Heineken, bought up the Amsterdam brewery Van Vollenhoven's Bierbrouwerij, which was closed in 1961. In 1954, Amstel built a brewery in Dutch Guiana. A few years later, Amstel was the first Dutch brewery to export beer in cans. At this time, the total exports of Amstel beer amounted to 101,000 hectoliters. In 1958 a subsidiary of Amstel produced its first beer in Jordan. In 1960, the third subsidiary of Amstel was opened in Cura√ßao. 1963 saw the opening of two new breweries, one in Puerto Rico and one in Greece. Amstel was bought out by Heineken International in 1968.Oliver Garrett, The Oxford Companion to Beer (Oxford : Oxford University Press, 2011) p.49. In 1972 the Amstel Brewery in Amsterdam was closed and production was relocated to the main Heineken plant in Zoeterwoude. The building on the Mauritskade was torn down. Only the former administration building was kept and has since become part of the Hogeschool van Amsterdam. At the end of the 20th century, in Spain, Heineken International decided to replace the local centennial brand El √Åguila and convert it into Amstel. Beers Heineken offers several beers under the Amstel brand.Heineken Nederland Amstel Lager uses predominantly light pilsner malt, although some dark malt is also used. It is sold in 75 countries. Amstel Light is a 3.5% Alcohol by Volume (ABV) pale lager sold in the USA and The Netherlands, a 2.5% ABV variant sold in New Zealand, 4.1% ABV in the United Kingdom, and 4.0% ABV in Mexico. Amstel 1870 is a slightly dark 5% abv lager. In France a beer called Amstel Free, with minimal alcohol content -about one per cent ABV- is produced. A non-alcoholic beer, Amstel Zero, can be purchased in the Netherlands, Greece, Egypt and few other countries. Amstel Ultra Light is a beer made by Heineken Mexico for the Mexican market. Amstel also markets a shandy called Amstel Radler in several countries. It contains 2% alcohol and it is a mix of lager beer and lemonade.

Overview  The bus was a regular coach, which are common in Nepal for transporting local people around the Himalayan mountains. The bus was travelling its usual route to the stop in the rural town of Badarmude 175 km south of Kathmandu with at least 120 passengers on board and on the roof at the time of the attack. As the bus crossed a small wooden bridge over a mountain stream, a member of a terrorist organisation detonated a small bomb from his position 250m away behind a tree. The bomb was not large enough to seriously damage the bus on its own, but did succeed in collapsing the fragile bridge into the stream below, taking the bus with it. Parts of the bus and its passengers littered the banks stream and remains of the bridge, and injured people requiring immediate medical assistance were scattered throughout the wreckage. Local people provided the most immediate relief, but army officials were hampered in organising a proper rescue operation, due to the remote nature of the terrain. The eventual report stated that there were 38 dead (some sources say 53), and 71 injured, some of them very seriously, including those requiring amputation and lengthy hospitalisation. The attack has not been claimed, but was almost certainly the work of the Communist Party of Nepal, fervent Maoists, who have been fighting the Nepal Civil War against the monarchy since 1996 . Their great opponent in King Gyanendra has recently stepped up attacks on their positions and a crackdown on their supporters, following his reinstatement of absolute monarchy in Nepal following mild democratic reforms. The CPN does not have a history of attacking purely civilian targets, and previous assaults on buses have either been because the bus was transporting troops, or had been violating strikes ordered by the CPN. Neither was the case here, and the cause of the attack remains unknown.

Lyrics The original lyrics, written by Lead Belly, state that the fields are \\"down in Louisiana, just ten miles from Texarkana\\". Later versions (e.g., Creedence Clearwater Revival's) say the fields are \\"down in Louisiana, just about a mile from Texarkana\\". Both are geographically impossible; Texarkana (the part in Texas as well as the part in Arkansas) is about 30 miles north of the Arkansas‚ÄìLouisiana border.  Further use  The song has been taken up by bluegrass musicians, far from actual cotton yielding regions. E.g. the German skiffle band Die Rh√∂ner S√§uw√§ntzt describe their style as Musik von den Baumwollfeldern der Rh√∂n, translating into \\"music played in the Rh√∂n Mountains (imaginary) cotton fields\\".see Bo k√∂mmsten du h√§√§? ; Wo kommst du denn her?

In order to keep the words sounding similar, the meaning of the song was completely changed.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aLXN9teNVQ Regional Mexican musician Ramon Ayala also covered the Spanish version of \\"Cottonfields\\" in 1989, and it became a well-known hit for years.

Tagged repairs in process can be seen on lower shelves at left, and service parts in labeled boxes seen above them. A computer repair technician is a person who repairs and maintains computers and servers. The technician's responsibilities may extend to include building or configuring new hardware, installing and updating software packages, and creating and maintaining computer networks. Overview Computer technicians work in a variety of settings, encompassing both the public and private sectors. Because of the relatively brief existence of the profession, institutions offer certificate and degree programs designed to prepare new technicians, but computer repairs are frequently performed by experienced and certified technicians who have little formal training in the field.Computer Support Specialists and Systems Administrators, Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, Computer Support Specialists : Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2019. Private sector computer repair technicians can work in corporate information technology departments, central service centers or in retail computer sales environments. Public sector computer repair technicians might work in the military, national security or law enforcement communities, health or public safety field, or an educational institution. Despite the vast variety of work environments, all computer repair technicians perform similar physical and investigative processes, including technical support and often customer service. Experienced computer repair technicians might specialize in fields such as data recovery, system administration, networking or information systems. Some computer repair technicians are self-employed or own a firm that provides services in a regional area. Some are subcontracted as freelancers or consultants. This type of computer repair technician ranges from hobbyists and enthusiasts to those who work professionally in the field. Computer malfunctions can range from a minor setting that is incorrect, to spyware, viruses, and as far as replacing hardware and an entire operating system. Some technicians provide on-site services, usually at an hourly rate. Others can provide services off-site, where the client can drop their computers and other devices off at the repair shop. Some have pickup and drop off services for convenience. Some technicians may also take back old equipment for recycling. This is required in the EU, under WEEE rules. Hardware repair While computer hardware configurations vary widely, a Computer repair technician that works on OEM equipment will work with five general categories of hardware; desktop computers, laptops, servers, computer clusters and smartphones / mobile computing devices. Technicians also work with and occasionally repair a range of peripherals, including input devices (like keyboards, mice, webcams and scanners), output devices (like displays, printers, and speakers), and data storage devices such as internal and external hard drives and disk arrays. Technicians involved in system administration might also work with networking hardware, including routers, switches, cabling, fiber optics, and wireless networks. OEM = Original Equipment Manufacturer. Software repair When possible, computer repair technicians protect the computer user's data and settings. Following a repair, an ideal scenario will give the user access to the same data and settings that were available to them prior to repair. To address a software problem, the technician could take an action as minor as adjusting a single setting or they may implore more involved techniques such as: installing, uninstalling, or reinstalling various software packages. Advanced software repairs often involve directly editing keys and values in the Windows Registry or running commands directly from the command prompt. A reliable, but somewhat more complicated procedure for addressing software issues is known as a system restore (also referred to as imaging, and/or reimaging), in which the computer's original installation image (including operating system and original applications) is reapplied to a formatted hard drive. Anything unique such as settings or personal files will be destroyed if not backed up on external media, as this reverts everything back to its original unused state. The computer technician can only reimage if there is an image of the hard drive for that computer either in a separate partition or stored elsewhere. On a Microsoft Windows system, if there is a restore point that was saved (normally saved on the hard drive of the computer) then the installed applications and Windows Registry can be restored to that point. This procedure may solve problems that have arisen after the time the restore point was created. Finally, if no image or system restore point is available, a fresh copy of the operating system is recommended. Formatting and reinstalling the operating system will require the license information from the initial purchase. If none is available, the operating system may require a new licence to be used.  Data Recovery  One of the most common tasks performed by computer repair technicians after software updates and screen repairs is data recovery. This is the process of recovering lost data from a corrupted or otherwise unaccessable hard drive. In most cases a third-party data recovery software is used to retrieve the data and transfer to a new hard drive. Specialists says in about 15% of the cases the data is unable to be recovered as the hard disk is damaged to a point where it will no longer function. Blackblaze's annual report indicates that the hard drive failure rate for the first quarter of 2020 was 1.07%.  Education  Education requirements vary by company and individual proprietor. The entry level requirement is generally based on the extent of the work expected. Often a 4 year degree will be required for a more specialized technician, whereas a general support technician may only require a 2 year degree or some post secondary classes.  Certification  = Common Certifications = The most common certification for computer repair technicians are the CompTIA A+ Certification and Network+ Certification. = Additional Certifications = Additional certifications are useful when technicians are expanding their skill set. These will be useful when seeking advanced, higher paying positions. These are generally offered by specific software or hardware providers and will give the technician an in- depth knowledge of the systems related to that software or hardware. For instance, the Microsoft Technology Associate and Microsoft Certified Solutions Associate certifications give the technician proof that they have mastered PC fundamentals.  Additional Computer Technician Certifications  * Microsoft (MCSE, MCITP, MCTS) * Apple (ACSP, ACTC) * International Information Systems Security Certification Consortium (CISSP) * Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA) * Project Management Professional (PMP)  Additional Network Technician Certifications  * Cisco CCNA and CCNP * Cisco CCIE Enterprise Infrastructure and CCIE Enterprise Wireless * SolarWinds Certified Professional * Wireshark WCNA License In Texas, computer companies and professionals are required to have private investigators‚Äô licenses if they access computer data for purposes other than diagnosis or repair.

Today, restored to its original 1830s condition,www.southperth.wa.gov.au The Old Mill. Accessed 20 April 2006. it is one of Perth's best known historic landmarks and serves as a sightseeing attraction. History The windmill was commissioned by William Kernot Shenton, on a foundation stone laid by Governor James Stirling in 1835. The original mill, the colony's first wind-powered industry, was built by Paul and James Lockyer and operated by William Steele. Peak production was of flour per day. Operation ceased in 1859, due to unprofitability and the unsuitable location. The four ton cogwheels were hewn from a nearby tree known as tuart, the highly valued species Eucalyptus gomphocephala. The site was located near the earliest housing and agriculture of the colony, and was used for industry before being adapted to commercial, then residential, purposes. In 1880 an engineer known as \\"Satan\\" Browne established a dance hall and hotel known as Alta Gardens. The alterations by Browne remained, although the venture was a failure, and it found use as a chicken run and house instead. The address of the site is now listed as Mill Point Road, South Perth. In 1957 the proposed route of the Narrows Bridge was deviated to preserve the site, after a campaign by public officials, and a folk museum was established on the grounds. The site was received by the City of South Perth, repaired and upgraded and was placed on the register of the National Trust in 1992. The buildings and site is noted as having permanent entry on heritage registers for its architectural and historical significance, and conservation \\"... for their own sake, and as a museum, is important\\".

It is used to rapidly increase DNA library size. Procedure First, DNase is used to fragment a set of parent genes into pieces of 50-100 bp in length. This is then followed by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) without primers- DNA fragments with sufficient overlapping homologous sequence will anneal to each other and are then extended by DNA polymerase. Several rounds of this PCR extension are allowed to occur, after some of the DNA molecules reach the size of the parental genes. These genes can then be amplified with another PCR, this time with the addition of primers that are designed to complement the ends of the strands. The primers may have additional sequences added to their 5' ends, such as sequences for restriction enzyme recognition sites needed for ligation into a cloning vector. It is possible to recombine portions of these genes to generate hybrids or chimeric forms with unique properties, hence the term DNA shuffling. Shuffling methods =Using restriction enzymes= #Restriction enzymes that cut in similar places are used to digest members of the gene family #DNA fragments are joined together with DNA ligase #Large numbers of hybrids that can be tested for unique properties are produced =Using DNAse 1= #Different members of the gene family are fragmented using DNase 1 followed by PCR #During PCR different members of the family are cross-primed, i.e. homological DNA fragments will anneal to each other #The generated hybrids are then used to generate a library of mutants, which are tested for unique properties See also * SCOPE (protein engineering) * RACHITT * Homologous recombination  References  Category:DNA Category:Molecular_biology_techniques ","title":"DNA shuffling"},{"id":"4820429","text":"Robert H.

The Liquor and Cannabis Board is part of the executive branch and reports to the Governor. The board's primary function is the licensing of on and off premises establishments which sell any type of alcohol, and the enforcement and education of the state's alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis laws. In November 2011, citizen's initiative 1183 was passed to end the state monopoly on liquor sales that has held since the end of prohibition, beginning June 1, 2012. State and local government revenues are projected to increase by $42 million and $38 million respectively over the next six years as a result along with a 48 percent increase in alcohol consumption. In November 2012, citizen's initiative 502 was passed legalizing the recreational use of cannabis and assigning regulation of the cannabis industry to the then Liquor Control Board. The board's name was officially changed to reflect the addition of cannabis effective July 24, 2015. History Alcohol prohibition was repealed by Washington Initiative 61 in 1932, and from 1933 to 2012, the WSLCB was the sole distributor of all liquors and spirits in the state. In addition, they were also the primary retailer: the state operated 167 stores, while 163 stores were operated by private businesses who contracted with the state for a commission on the sales. These contract stores were generally located in either smaller cities or more remote and rural areas, while the state stores were typically located in larger, more populated areas. Because the state was the sole distributor of all spirits, uniform pricing was set so that the price of any given product was the same from store to store no matter how rural or populated the area was. Historically, off-premises Sunday sales of spirits were banned, and all liquor stores were closed. Consumers still had the option of purchasing beer or wine from grocery stores or on-premises spirits from bars and restaurants. In 2005, the state began allowing off-premises spirits sales in select stores on Sundays from 12pm to 5pm. On the November 8, 2011 election, voters passed Initiative 1183, which brought several changes to the liquor distribution and retailing system. The most significant of these changes were the end to the state monopoly on liquor sales and distribution. On June 1, 2012, Washington completed its transition to private liquor sales. Under 1183, spirits may only be sold in premises of at least 10,000 sq ft, generally including grocery stores, warehouse clubs, department stores, and some larger specialty shops. Exceptions to the 10,000 sq ft rule are granted for any former state or contract store that has chosen to remain open under private ownership, and for establishments that are in a \\"trade area\\" where no building exists that meets the 10,000 sq ft requirement. The WSLCB has not yet defined \\"trade area\\". Under the state-run system, the shelf price included all taxes. Under the private system, as implemented by 1183, all spirits are to be taxed at 20.5% on the shelf price in addition to a flat spirits liter tax of $3.7708/liter. Many retailers no longer include these taxes in the shelf price, which has led to some sticker shock and confusion at the register. For instance, a 1.75l bottle of whiskey with a shelf price of $15.99 will have $3.28 in sales tax and $6.60 in liter taxes added at the register, bringing the total cost to $25.87. On July 24, 2015, a law that changed the name to the Liquor and Cannabis Board came into effect. Enforcement and Education Division Liquor Enforcement Officers are assigned to the Education and Enforcement Division with Liquor Enforcement Officers enforcing state alcohol, tobacco, vapor products, and drug laws. These officers are considered limited- authority law enforcement with authority only over the state's alcohol, tobacco, vapor products, and drug laws. The Enforcement Division conducts compliance checks where underage and undercover state workers attempt to purchase alcohol or tobacco products from state licensed businesses. Individuals who sell to minors are arrested or cited; the associated business receives a notice of an administrative violation. Officers also conduct operations to detect violations such as overserving patrons. In 2008, the first class of the Basic Liquor Law Enforcement Academy (BLLEA) graduated from the Washington State Criminal Justice Training Center. A second class of BLLEA was conducted in 2009, BLEA has since been cancelled due to a lack of state funding. As a result, the agency now sends new officer through the full Basic Law Enforcement Academy (BLEA.) The current Chief of the Enforcement and Education Division is Justin Nordhorn. The Division has regional offices in Federal Way, Tacoma, Spokane, Mountlake Terrace and Mount Vernon as well as field offices in Seattle and Pasco. = Alcohol Impact Areas (AIAs) = In 2005, the Seattle City Council asked the Liquor Control Board to prohibit the sale of certain low-priced, highly-alcoholic beverages in an impoverished \\"Alcohol Impact Area.\\" The City requested the order after an earlier, \\"Good Neighbor\\" policy, in which the city requested convenience stores and liquor outlets in areas with large homeless populations voluntarily pull products known for their popularity with alcoholics, failed to adequately control the sale of such products to homeless individuals. Among the products sought to be banned were over two dozen beers, and six wines: Cisco, Gino's Premium Blend, MD 20/20, Night Train, Thunderbird, and Wild Irish Rose. The Liquor Control Board approved these restrictions on August 30, 2006.Seattle's Alcohol Impact Areas: The Extended Central Core AIA, City of Seattle website. The cities of Tacoma, Spokane, and Olympia also followed suit in instituting \\"Alcohol Impact Areas\\" of their own following Seattle's example. Vancouver has an AIA that is technically voluntary, though it currently has a 100% retailer compliance rate. Licensing and Regulation Division The Licensing and Regulation Division issues liquor licenses, which numbered 14,604 in fiscal year 2006. Liquor licenses are issued to businesses and not-for-profit organizations. Various licenses exist and each license is suited to a particular type of business and product mix. Breweries, wineries, and distilleries would be licensed to produce their specific class of alcoholic beverages. Wholesalers and distributors would be licensed to buy beer and/or wine from breweries and wineries and sell to retailers. Retail licenses fit two categories depending on where the alcohol will be consumed. Retailers like grocery stores are licensed to sell beer, wine, and spirits to customers who take the products home or elsewhere. Retailers like bars and restaurants are licensed to serve alcoholic beverages for on-site consumption. This group of retailers can be licensed to serve either beer and wine or beer, wine, and spirits. Some activities require a special endorsement or permit such as caterer offering alcohol at a client's event. =Alcohol Server Permits= The Division manages the Mandatory Alcohol Server Training (MAST) program. Under state law, people who serve alcoholic beverages at a bar, restaurant, or similar establishment need to possess an Alcohol Server Permit. The division certifies private entities to provide Mandatory Alcohol Server Training (MAST) courses. These private entities, called trainers, offer MAST courses to individuals like bartenders, servers, waiters, and restaurant managers. When an individual completes an approved MAST course, the certified trainer sends that information to the Board, which issues an Alcohol Server Permit (either a Class 12 or Class 13 permit) to the individual. A class 13 permit allows a person to carry beer, wine, or spirits to a customer's table and pour wine from a bottle into a customer's glass. A class 12 permit allows a person to pour spirits, make mixed drinks (cocktails), and draw beer from a tap in addition to what a class 13 permit allows. A person must be at least 18 years old to hold a class 13 permit and at least 21 years old to hold a class 12 permit. Any licensed establishment must have at least one person with a class 12 permit on-duty to serve alcoholic beverages to its customers. A person with a class 13 permit must be supervised by a person with a class 12 permit. Some violations of the Alcohol Server Permit rules are misdemeanor or gross misdemeanor crimes.

It was the beginning of the 1850 to 1853 Yuma War. Downriver from a ferry owned by A.L. Lincoln, the Quechan set up a ferry business to transport people, beasts and goods across the Colorado River on their way to the California Gold Rush. John Joel Glanton and his scalp-hunting gang destroyed the Quechan boat and beat the local Quechan chief. For a while they took over Lincoln's ferry operation, killing Mexican and American passengers for their goods and money. In revenge, the Quechan attacked, killed, and scalped Glanton and most of the gang in 1850.\\"John Joel Glanton\\", Texas Handbook of History Online, accessed 2 December 2009 Later that year, the California state government recruited men for $6 a day to attack the Quechan. It was California's first military operation against aboriginal Americans. On April 16, 1850, 142 men commenced the expedition against the Quechan. However, the military operation went badly and the expedition members were besieged until September 16th. Because of the inflated costs of goods and wages during the Gold Rush, the cost of the operation reached $113,000, and nearly bankrupted the state.

He was a forerunner of paraconsistent and multi-valued logics. Early years Vasiliev was born on June 29 O.S., 1880 in Kazan, Russia. His father, Professor Alexander V. Vasiliev, was a fairly well known mathematician, his grandfather was the outstanding sinologist Professor Vassily P. Vasiliev, and his great grandfather was the prominent astronomer Ivan M. Simonov, who was a close colleague of Nikolai Lobachevsky. Wanting to be a psychologist, Vasiliev studied at the medical faculty and the historico-philological faculty of Kazan University (1906), where he was offered the position of privat-dozent in 1910. As a university student, Vasiliev was enthusiastic about symbolist style poetry and published some books of verses of his own (for example,\\"The longing for eternity\\") and translations of the poetry of Emile Verhaeren and Algernon Charles Swinburne. Work in logic Although Vasiliev outlined an abstract to the article on the \\"logic of relatives\\" by Charles Sanders Peirce as early as in 1897, it was only in 1908 that he entirely devoted himself to logic. On May 18, 1910 Vasiliev presented a lecture (published in October that same year) \\"On Partial Judgements, on the Triangle of Opposites, on the Law of Excluded Third\\" in which he put forward for the first time ever the idea of (non- Aristotelian) logic, free of the laws of excluded middle and contradiction. Reasoning by analogy with the \\"imaginary\\" geometry of Lobachevsky, Vasiliev called his novel logic \\"imaginary\\", for he assumed it was valid for the worlds where the above-mentioned laws did not hold, worlds with beings having other types of sensations. He distinguished levels of logical reasoning, and introduced the notion of metalogic. Vasiliev spent 1912-13 in Western Europe (mostly Germany) and published his salient works \\"Logic and Metalogic\\" and \\"Imaginary (non-Aristotelian) logic\\". Vasiliev constructed non-Aristotelian logic using the concepts, and even the manner of reasoning, common to Aristotelian logic. He was aware of the achievement in mathematical logic (and even carefully studied Ernst Schr√∂der's works) but did not make an attempt to formalise \\"imaginary\\" logic. His only work in a foreign language (English) - a concise abstract of his \\"imaginary logic\\" - was published in Naples in 1924. Late years In 1914, when World War I broke out, Vasiliev was drafted into the army, where he became seriously mentally ill. Nevertheless, he returned to teaching at Kazan University, but in 1922 was forcibly retired by the new Bolshevik administration. This act aggravated his ailment: Vasiliev spent most of the following 20 years in a mental hospital, thus rescued from the Stalin regime. He died on December 31, 1940. The place where he was buried is unknown. The pioneer ideas of Vasiliev were rediscovered in the early 1960s by Vladimir Smirnov, and formed a basis mainly for paraconsistent logic. Some well-known scholars in the 1960s considered his work to be the precursor of multi-valued logic. The informal style and conceptual riches of Vasiliev's works make them especially valuable. In 2012 an international conference on Vasiliev's work was held in Moscow where a number of important modern paraconsistent logicians contributed.

It is migratory breeding from Mexico to Panama and wintering in the northern and eastern Andes and the western Amazon Basin. Taxonomy The yellow-green vireo was formally described by the American ornithologist John Cassin in 1851 under the binomial name Vireosylvia flavoviridis. The specific epithet combines the Latin flavus meaning \\"yellow\\" and viridis meaning \\"green\\". The type locality is San Juan de Nicaragua. The yellow-green vireo is now placed in the genus Vireo that was introduced in 1808 by the French ornithologist Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot. The title page bears a date of 1807 but the volume did not appear until the following year. Five subspecies are recognised: * V. f. hypoleucus Van Rossem & Hachisuka, 1937 ‚Äì northwest Mexico (southeast Sonora to south Sinaloa) * V. f. flavoviridis (Cassin, 1851) ‚Äì north central, northeast Mexico to Panama * V. f. forreri Madar√°sz, 1885 ‚Äì Islas Mar√≠as (off west Mexico) * V. f. perplexus (Phillips, AR, 1991) ‚Äì north Guatemala * V. f. vanrossemi (Phillips, AR, 1991) ‚Äì southeast El Salvador Description The adult yellow-green vireo is 14‚Äì14.7 cm in length and weighs 18.5 g. It has olive-green upperparts and a dusky-edged gray crown. There is a dark line from the bill to the red-brown eyes, and a white supercilium. The underparts are white with yellow breast sides and flanks. Young birds are duller with brown eyes, a brown tint to the back, and less yellow on the underparts. The adult yellow-green vireo differs from the red- eyed vireo in its much yellower underparts, lack of a black border to the duller gray crown, yellower upperparts and different eye color. Some individuals are difficult to separate, even in the hand, from the similar red- eyed vireo, with which it is sometimes considered conspecific. Its exact status as a passage bird in countries such as Venezuela is therefore uncertain. The yellow-green vireo has a nasal ' call, and the song is a repetitive veree veer viree, fee‚Äôer vireo viree, shorter and faster than that of the red-eyed vireo. This species rarely sings on its wintering grounds. Distribution and habitat It breeds from southern Texas (occasionally the Rio Grande Valley) in the United States and the western and eastern mountain ranges of northern Mexico (the Sierra Madre Occidental and Sierra Madre Oriental‚Äîalso the Cordillera Neovolcanica) south to central Panama. It is migratory, wintering in the northern and eastern Andes and the western Amazon Basin. This vireo occurs in the canopy and middle levels of light woodland, the edges of forest, and gardens at altitudes from sea level to 1500 m. Behaviour and ecology =Breeding= The 6.5-cm-wide cup nest is built by the female from a wide range of plant materials, and attached to a stout twig normally 1.5‚Äì3.5 m above the ground in a tree, but occasionally up to 12 m high. The normal clutch is two or three brown-marked white eggs laid from March to June and incubated by the female alone, although the male helps to feed the chicks. The breeding birds return to Central America from early February to March, and most depart southwards by mid-October. =Feeding= Yellow-green vireos feed on insects gleaned from tree foliage, favoring caterpillars and beetles. They also eat small fruits, including mistletoe berries, and, in winter quarters, those of Cymbopetalum mayanum (Annonaceae) and gumbo-limbo (Bursera simaruba).Foster (2007) Gallery Image:Yellow- green Vireo RWD.jpgPanama  References  * Hilty, Steven L.

Biography Born at Bear Valley in Sauk County, Wisconsin, Lucius's father was Conrad Nieman; and Sara Elizabeth Delamater was his mother. He had an older sister Violette. Lucius was two years of age when his father died. His mother took him home to her parents: H. H. and Susan Cuppernall in Mukwonago. A local schoolteacher boarded at their home, and Lucius benefited from the adult company. Theron Haight, editor of The Waukesha Freeman, gave Lucius his start in the publishing industry. At age 12 he was set to menial tasks, and eventually learned to set type. This skill brought him to the composing room of The Milwaukee Sentinel in 1871. Ambitious to become a journalist, Lucius returned to his grandmother Delamater and study at Carroll College in Waukesha. In fact, he became the Waukesha correspondent for The Milwaukee Sentinel. The paper continued to employ Lucius, next as a reporter for Milwaukee, then in 1875 as correspondent in Madison covering government business in the state capital. He became managing editor in 1876. In 1880 Nieman went to Saint Paul, Minnesota as managing editor of the Saint Paul Dispatch. Though successful in boosting circulation and advertising, Nieman left Minnesota and returned to Wisconsin. There Peter V. Deuster was running for re-election to Congress and publishing The Daily Journal to promote his campaign. Nieman acquired half interest in the paper on December 11, 1882. Deuster returned to Washington and Nieman became editor in chief and had editorial independence. The name was changed to The Milwaukee Journal, and from modest beginnings the paper grew to challenge The Sentinel for dominance in Milwaukee.Harry J. Grant (April 7, 1941) Lucius W. Nieman, Newspaperman from archived Nieman Foundation article from Harvard University Nieman intended to provide a \\"channel for the expression of views not dictated by 'bossism' or corrupted by 'machine' politics.\\"About Lucius William Nieman from Diederich College of Communication at Marquette University The paper advocated \\"regulation of public utilities, conservation of the state‚Äôs natural resources, reforestation, development of the state‚Äôs water-power resources, and a better highway program.\\"Nieman, Lucius William 1857 ‚Äî 1935 from Wisconsin Historical Society In 1895 Nieman responded to a plea to help the less fortunate. \\"It might be a downright good thing to have the women run the Journal for a day\\", he said. On February 22 men were replaced in the editorial and business offices by female reporters and managers.Silk edition of the Milwaukee Journal from Milwaukee Historical Society Agnes Elizabeth Gunter Wahl became Mrs. Nieman on November 29, 1900. Her father Christian Wahl is known as \\"the father of Milwaukee‚Äôs public park system\\". Legacy The Nieman Foundation for Journalism was established after his widow, Agnes Wahl Nieman, left Harvard University $1 million in her will in 1937. Nieman Fellowships for study at Harvard are awarded to experienced news reporters. James Bryant Conant was President of Harvard when the bequest was made. Mrs. Nieman had stipulated that funds were to be used to raise standards of journalism. The fellowship program for proven reporters was established by Conant after some consultations.James Bryant Conant, Chemist and Harvard President from American Chemical Society The NiemanlabNiemanLab covers the Nieman Foundation, Nieman Reports, and Nieman Storyboard.

In 1939 he was the Bureau Chief of the International News Service in Washington, D.C. In late 1949, during a game of hearts, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover and Bill came up with the idea for a list of names, photographs, and descriptions of the ten worst criminals wanted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). On March 14, 1950, the list was compiled and distributed as the FBI's Most Wanted Fugitives list.https://www.genealogy4me.com/Names.htm Following his transatlantic solo flight and return to the United States in 1927, Charles Lindbergh gave his flight jacket to Bill.

The Phillies stunned the 104-win Braves, who were bidding for their third consecutive World Series appearance, and won the NLCS, 4‚Äì2. The Phillies would go on to lose to the Toronto Blue Jays in the World Series in six games. Background The Phillies, led by outfielder Lenny Dykstra and pitcher Curt Schilling, had gone from worst-to- first and cruised to a division title with a 97‚Äì65 record, and continued the exclusive reign of NL East championships by the Phillies and the Pittsburgh Pirates, their in-state rivals during the early 1990s. The Braves, who had advanced to the World Series each of the past two seasons, won a classic division race over the 103‚Äì59 San Francisco Giants, finishing with a franchise-best 104‚Äì58 record. The heavily favored and playoff-seasoned Braves brought their legendary pitching rotation of Cy Young winner Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, John Smoltz, and Steve Avery into the NLCS with them. Summary After Philadelphia edged Atlanta in an exciting Game 1 that went into extra innings, the Braves hammered the Phillies in the next two games to a take a 2‚Äì1 series lead. However, the Braves' bats suddenly fell silent and the Phillies rebounded by winning close contests in the final two games in Atlanta to send the series back to Veterans Stadium with Philadelphia on top three games to two. The Phillies took Game 6 by a score of 6‚Äì3, sending them to their first World Series appearance in ten years. =Philadelphia Phillies vs. Atlanta Braves= Game summaries =Game 1= Wednesday, October 6, 1993, at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Curt Schilling began the series spectacularly by striking out the first five hitters he faced. The Phillies struck first in the bottom of the first on John Kruk's RBI forceout off of Steve Avery with runners on first and third, but the Braves tied the game in the third on back-to-back two-out doubles by Avery and Otis Nixon. Next inning, after a leadoff walk and single, David Justice's sacrifice fly put the Braves up 2‚Äì1, but Pete Incaviglia's home run in the bottom of the inning tied the game. The game would be back and forth and low-scoring. In the sixth, Philadelphia loaded the bases with one out on two walks and a double when a wild pitch by Avery give them to a 3‚Äì2 lead. In the top of the ninth, after a leadoff walk to Bill Pecota off of Mitch Williams, third baseman Kim Batiste's errant throw to first on Mark Lemke's groundball put runners on first and third with no out. After a sacrifice bunt, Nixon's groundout tied the game, forcing extra innings. In the bottom of the tenth, after a one-out double by Kruk off of Greg McMichael, Batiste lined a double just beyond the reach of Atlanta third baseman Terry Pendleton to score the winning run. Schilling finished the game with eight innings pitched and ten strikeouts in the no-decision. =Game 2= Thursday, October 7, 1993, at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania The Braves offense crushed Phillies starter Tommy Greene in Game 2. An upper deck two-run home run by Fred McGriff gave Atlanta a 2‚Äì0 first inning lead. In the third, Jeff Blauser's one-out home run extended their lead to 3‚Äì0. After a double, single and walk loaded the bases, Terry Pendleton's two-run single made it 5‚Äì0 Braves and knock Greene out of the game. Damon Berryhill's three-run home run off of Bobby Thigpen made it 8‚Äì0 Braves. Greg Maddux gave up just two runs (on Dave Hollins's two-run home run in the fourth) in seven innings. Pendleton's home run in the fifth off of Ben Rivera made it 9‚Äì2 Braves. In the eighth, with two on via a single and error, Otis Nixon's RBI single made it 10‚Äì2 Braves off of David West. After another single loaded the bases, Ron Gant cleared them with a double. In the ninth, Sid Bream singled with two outs off of Larry Andersen and scored on Nixon's double. Mike Stanton pitched a scoreless eighth and Mark Wohlers allowed a home run to Lenny Dykstra in the ninth as the Braves' 14‚Äì3 win tied the series heading south to Atlanta. =Game 3= Saturday, October 9, 1993, at Atlanta‚ÄìFulton County Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia The Phillies struck first in Game 3 on back-to-back leadoff triples by Mariano Duncan and John Kruk in the fourth off of Tom Glavine. Kurt's home run in the sixth extended their lead to 2‚Äì0, but Glavine allowed no other runs in seven innings pitched. Terry Mulholland pitched five shutout innings before the Braves' offense erupted in the sixth. After a leadoff single and walk, consecutive RBI singles by Fred McGriff and Terry Pendleton tied the game. David Justice's two-run double then put the Braves up 4‚Äì2. Roger Mason relieved Mulholland and second baseman Duncan's error on Mark Lemke's ground ball allowed another run to score to make it 5‚Äì2 Braves. Next inning, Pendleton's single with two on off of Larry Andersen made it 6‚Äì2 Braves. David West then allowed a two-out walk to load the bases before Lemke's bases-clearing double made it 9‚Äì2 Braves. In the top of the eighth, Duncan tripled with one out off of Kent Mercker and scored on Kruk's groundout. Next inning, Greg McMichael allowed a one-out double, single and RBI double to Jim Eisenreich before retiring the next two batters to end the game as the Braves took a 2‚Äì1 series lead with a 9‚Äì4 win. =Game 4= Sunday, October 10, 1993, at Atlanta‚ÄìFulton County Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia John Smoltz and Danny Jackson faced off in a close Game 4. The Braves took an early 1‚Äì0 lead on a Mark Lemke double in the second with two on, but the Phillies went on top in the fourth inning with two unearned runs. Darren Daulton reached on Lemke's error, then moved to third on Milt Thompson's double. After Kevin Stocker's sacrifice fly tied the game, starter Jackson hit the go-ahead RBI single. Atlanta had baserunners throughout the rest of the game, but could not get a clutch hit as the Phillies hung on to win 2‚Äì1. Phillies closer Mitch Williams allowed the first two runners to reach in the ninth, but a double play groundout by Ron Gant helped him get out of it and earn the save. The Phillies left 15 runners on, going 1 for 11 with them in scoring position, while the Braves stranded 11, going 1 for 15 with them in scoring position. =Game 5= Monday, October 11, 1993, at Atlanta‚ÄìFulton County Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia With the series tied 2‚Äì2, the Phillies and Braves needed extra innings to decide Game 5. Philadelphia got on the board in the first off Steve Avery when Mariano Duncan singled and John Kruk doubled down the right field line. In the bottom of the first, the Braves missed a chance to score when Fred McGriff hit one off the top of the right field fence sending Jeff Blauser racing around third to try to score. However, Wes Chamberlain fielded the carom cleanly, threw to shortstop Kevin Stocker, who then relayed the ball home to nail Blauser. In the fourth the Phils went up 2‚Äì0 on Chamberlain's sacrifice fly which scored Pete Incaviglia who had reached on a three base error committed by Ron Gant. Meanwhile, Curt Schilling was again lights out, tossing nine strikeouts. In the top of the ninth, a seemingly inconsequential insurance run scored when Darren Daulton homered off Greg McMichael. However, up 3‚Äì0 entering the bottom of the ninth, trouble brewed on the horizon. Schilling walked Blauser to open the frame. Then Gant hit a sharp grounder to third which Kim Batiste booted for his second key error of the series. Mitch Williams was again asked to relieve Schilling, who would take a seat in the dugout peeking in through a towel at the beleaguered closer. The first batter Williams faced, McGriff, roped an RBI single past Duncan sending Blauser home and Gant to third. David Justice then hit a sacrifice fly to left scoring Gant which cut the lead to 3‚Äì2. Terry Pendleton followed with a bullet past the mound and '92 LCS hero Francisco Cabrera chopped a ball up the middle that skipped past Stocker's glove to tie the game at 3‚Äì3. With one out and Pendleton taking third on the Cabrera hit, the series was hanging in the balance with the Braves away from victory. The next batter Mark Lemke lined a shot down the left field line that looked to be a game- ending base hit for Atlanta. The crowd at Fulton County Stadium screamed and then sighed as the ball veered foul at the last second. Williams regrouped to strikeout Lemke and got Bill Pecota on a flyout to hold the game even. In the tenth, Lenny Dykstra vaulted Philadelphia back into the lead when he drilled a full count Mark Wohlers fastball over the fence in dead center field. 40-year- old Larry Andersen then came on in the bottom half to retire the Braves in order, closing out the 4‚Äì3 nail biter. The victory put the Phillies up 3‚Äì2 going back to the Vet. =Game 6= Wednesday, October 13, 1993, at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Trying to force a Game 7, the Braves sent their ace, Greg Maddux to the mound in Game 6. However, a Mickey Morandini line drive in the first inning hit Maddux in the leg. He stayed in the game, but was not the same. Darren Daulton hit a bases-loaded two-run double in the third. After the Braves got on the board in the fifth on Jeff Blauser's RBI single with two on off of Tommy Greene, Dave Hollins connected for a two-run home run in the bottom of the inning, putting Philadelphia on top 4‚Äì1. Morandini's two-run triple in the sixth finally chased Maddux, who later refused to make any excuses for his subpar performance but did acknowledge when asked that he had been pitching in pain from the line drive he took off his leg in the 1st inning. Blauser hit a two-run home run in the seventh to make it 6‚Äì3 Phillies, but David West and Mitch Williams finished the Braves with a perfect eighth and ninth, respectively. It was their first pennant in 10 years. Although he did not get any decisions during his two appearances in the six-game series, Curt Schilling's 1.69 ERA and 19 strikeouts were still enough to earn him the 1993 NLCS Most Valuable Player Award. Schilling became the only pitcher in major league history to be named a postseason series MVP (League Championship Series or World Series) without either a pitching decision or a save, . Composite box 1993 NLCS (4‚Äì2): Philadelphia Phillies over Atlanta Braves Aftermath In the 1993 World Series, the Phillies put up a good fight against the defending champion Toronto Blue Jays, but they fell 4‚Äì2 due to Joe Carter's dramatic three-run walk-off home run off Philadelphia closer Mitch Williams in Game 6. Although Williams is most often associated with Carter's home run, he was one of the major reasons why the Phillies got to the World Series in the first place. In the NLCS, Williams was the winning pitcher in Games 1 and 5, but only because he gave up the game-tying runs. In addition, he saved Game 4 and the clincher, Game 6 for the Phillies.

The date of his death is unknown but is believed to have occurred no earlier than 1936. Education and Scientific Career Orlov studied at the Natural Sciences Faculty of Moscow University. His academic career began in 1916, when he published several papers related to the method of inductive reasoning and the notion of inductive proof. For 7 years beginning 1916, he published no scientific work, presumably because of the political turmoil of the era. In the 1920s, he taught in the newly established Communist Academy, and was an officer at the Chemical Institute. In 1923 Orlov resumed his academic activity, becoming very productive. Most of his papers were published in leading Soviet ideological journals, where he waxed polemical in the manner typical of that place and time. Orlov's work bore on the philosophy of mathematics and logic, specifically on the so-called dialectical logic, Marxist in nature. He wrote on the theory of probability, psychology, theory of music, and on chemical engineering. Logic Analyzing the development of the natural sciences, he sought to uncover their specific \\"logic.\\" According to Orlov, the laws of thought should be treated as formal rules, bounded by the laws of identity and contradiction. (When Orlov wrote this, the invention of natural deduction, the sequent calculus, and the semantic tableaux all lay in the future.) We must seek the semantic relation between antecedent and consequent. The main \\"contradiction of logic\\" manifests itself in the linkage of premise and corollary, and requires a logic different from the traditional one. If we insist that a corollary be a necessary condition of the premises then, according to Orlov, we necessarily arrive at a non-Aristotelian logic, dialectical in nature. =The Logic of Compatibility Propositions= Orlov proposed a logic of just this type in his work \\"The Logic of Compatibility of Propositions\\" published in 1928 in a Soviet mathematical journal. This paper analysed the problem of compatibility (noncompatibility) of propositions through the interpretative prism of an implication procedure. He also foresaw the translation of systems with intuitionistic negation into S4 modal logic with classical negation. Orlov's work was very little known for a long time, because his publications, all in Russian, were almost totally unknown outside of the Soviet Union. It is only with the post-World War II rise of what have come to be known as substructural logics (Restall 2000) that Orlov's pioneering role has gradually emerged. Substructural logics, a category including intuitionistic, relevant, linear logics, etc., can be obtained by restricting the natural deduction (\\"structural\\") rules for classical logic. For example, relevant logic does not employ the structural rule of weakening (also called the rule of monotonicity), and this rule is unlike the other structural rules (Dosen). Orlov believed in a mechanistic reduction of the laws of nature. He castigated the set theory of Georg Cantor, the theory of relativity (he believed in the existence of aether), and the heliobiology of A. Chizhevsky. Industrial Chemistry Around 1928, Orlov ceased publishing logical and philosophical work, turning to industrial chemistry, specifically the production of bromine and iodine, and in translating German works on chemistry into Russian.

The Marlins won the series, 4‚Äì2, and went on to defeat the Cleveland Indians in the 1997 World Series. Background Both teams hailed from the NL East division, the 101-win Braves being the division champions while the Marlins made the playoffs courtesy of the wild card. Both the Braves and Marlins swept their opponents during the Division Series. This was the second all-Southern postseason series, the first being in the previous round when Atlanta beat the Houston Astros. However, it was the first all- Southern postseason series to take place entirely in one time zone. This series marked the high point for the Braves-Marlins rivalry, as the Marlins made the playoffs only once from 1998‚Äì2019 (2003, which also ended with a World Series title). However, both franchises would eventually meet in the postseason again in the 2020 National League Division Series. Summary =Atlanta Braves vs. Florida Marlins= Game summaries =Game 1= Tuesday, October 7, 1997, at Turner Field in Atlanta The Marlins scored three unearned runs in the first inning off Greg Maddux when Fred McGriff's error on Jeff Conine's ground ball loaded the bases with two outs, then Mois√©s Alou hit a bases-clearing groundball double past Chipper Jones's glove (who made a weak attempt backhanding the ball). Atlanta got a run back in the bottom of the inning off Florida starter Kevin Brown with Keith Lockhart doubled with one out and scored on McGriff's single, but in the third, an error by center fielder Kenny Lofton on Gary Sheffield's fly ball allowed him to reach third, then after a walk, Alou's groundout and Charles Johnson's doubled scored a run each to put the Marlins ahead 5‚Äì1. All five runs they scored in this game were unearned. Home runs by Chipper Jones in the third and Ryan Klesko in the sixth drew Atlanta to 5‚Äì3, but the Florida bullpen held the Braves hitless over the final three innings. Brown, who went six innings, got the win. =Game 2= Wednesday, October 8, 1997, at Turner Field in Atlanta The Braves rallied from their sloppy Game 1 and routed pitcher Alex Fernandez, chasing him after innings. In the first, Kenny Lofton hit a leadoff single, then scored on Keith Lockhart's triple. After two strikeouts, Ryan Klesko's home run made it 3‚Äì0. A third inning two-run homer by Chipper Jones helped Atlanta build a 5‚Äì0 lead. In the bottom of the seventh, Tony Graffanino hit a leadoff double, then scored on Jones' single. Two walks loaded the bases before Javy Lopez's sacrifice fly made it 7‚Äì0 Braves. Starter Tom Glavine was excellent, giving up just one run (in the eighth when Charles Johnson walked with one out and scored on Devon White's double) in innings. It was learned after the game that Fernandez had been unknowingly pitching with a rotator cuff injury, and would be done for the series, which was tied 1‚Äì1 heading to Florida. =Game 3= Friday, October 10, 1997, at Pro Player Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida With the series shifting south to Miami, Game 3 began as a close game. In the top of the fourth inning the Braves loaded the bases with nobody out on a single, walk and error off of Tony Saunders, but could only score one run on Fred McGriff's sacrifice fly that scored Kenny Lofton. Gary Sheffield responded with a home run in the bottom of the fourth off of John Smoltz. This was the only home run the Marlins hit in the series. In the sixth, the Braves put runners on first and third with one out off of Saunders before Javy L√≥pez hit a sacrifice fly off of Livan Hernandez, which scored Jeff Blauser. However, the Marlins pulled away in the bottom half of the sixth, when they scored four runs to finish John Smoltz's night. With two on, two out, and a 1-2 count, Darren Daulton hit a clutch, game-tying double, scoring √âdgar Renter√≠a. After an intentional walk loaded the bases, light-hitting catcher Charles Johnson smacked a 2-2 pitch to left-center, clearing the bases and giving the Marlins a 5-2 lead. Hern√°ndez got the win as the Marlins took a 2‚Äì1 series lead. =Game 4= Saturday, October 11, 1997, at Pro Player Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida Denny Neagle stepped up and pitched a complete game, four-hit shutout of the Marlins in Game 4. The Braves offense, meanwhile, chipped away at Al Leiter. Fred McGriff followed a walk and single with an RBI single in the first, then after a double and walk in the third, Andruw Jones's RBI single made it 2‚Äì0 Braves. Jeff Blauser led off the fifth with a home run, then Chipper Jones singled and scored on Fred McGriff's double, putting the Braves on top 4‚Äì0. The win evened the series at 2‚Äì2, and with Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine scheduled to start Games 5 and 6 and the Florida pitching staff in apparent disarray, the advantage clearly fell with the Braves. =Game 5= Sunday, October 12, 1997, at Pro Player Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida After Neagle's gem in Game 4, Game 5 was clearly the pivotal game of the series. If the Marlins lost, the Braves would be up three games to two and going home with an almost certain NL pennant in sight. Liv√°n Hern√°ndez replaced Kevin Brown, who had fallen ill that day. The Braves threatened immediately in the first inning, with Kenny Lofton hitting a triple and Keith Lockhart being walked, putting runners on the corners with no outs. However, Livan regrouped and struck out the heart of the order. Florida scored a run in the bottom of the inning off Greg Maddux when Devon White was hit by a pitch. It was noted that he appeared to make no effort to get out of the way of the pitch, though this is rarely called against a player even though the rules state that a player can be called out for this. White subsequently stole second and after a walk, scored on Bobby Bonilla's single. The Braves evened the game with a Michael Tucker home run in the second. The score remained tied at 1‚Äì1 as Maddux and Hern√°ndez traded scoreless innings. In the bottom of the seventh, Bobby Bonilla doubled and scored on a single by Jeff Conine to give the Marlins a 2-1 lead. Hern√°ndez continued to shut down a befuddled Braves offense. The Braves had a chance for a potential two-out rally in the eighth with Lofton reaching on a walk, but was thrown out trying to steal second base. The game ended with Hernandez striking out Fred McGriff on a called third strike, on a 3-2 pitch that appeared to be at least a foot off the plate. Hern√°ndez pitched a complete game, three-hit, 15 strikeout masterpiece to reclaim a series lead for the Marlins. The Braves three, four, five hitters went 1-11 with seven strikeouts. This particular game is remembered for the controversy surrounding an unusually wide strike zone given to Hern√°ndez, by umpire Eric Gregg. While Gregg was long known to have a wide strike zone, this game took it to the extreme even for him, and the strike zone seemed to expand as the game went on. Furthermore, the strike zone seemed to be wider off the plate to left-handed hitters than it was to right-handed hitters, and while this was consistently the case with both teams, it disproportionately affected the Braves because they had six left-handers in their lineup to the Marlins' three. It was voted as the third-worst called game from 1975‚Äì2000 by Baseball America. Liv√°n Hern√°ndez set a record for most strikeouts in a National League Championship Series game with 15; just a day earlier Mike Mussina of the Baltimore Orioles had struck out 15 in the American League Championship Series against the Indians in Game 3. By contrast, the game left Maddux with an 0-2 record in the series despite an ERA of 1.38. =Game 6= Tuesday, October 14, 1997, at Turner Field in Atlanta Back at Turner Field with a World Series appearance looming, the Marlins went back to their ace, Kevin Brown. Facing Tom Glavine, Devon White singled, Edgar Renter√≠a walked, and Gary Sheffield singled to load the bases with no outs. Bobby Bonilla then smacked a two-run single. After a Jeff Conine sacrifice bunt and Moises Alou intentional walk, Glavine beaned Charles Johnson, scoring Sheffield, making it 3-0. Craig Counsell then grounded out, scoring Bonilla, making it 4-0 Marlins. The Braves struck back in the bottom half with Ryan Klesko singling home Keith Lockhart. The Braves closed to within one run in the second inning. Jeff Blauser singled with one out, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt, then scored on a Kenny Lofton single. After Lofton stole second and moved to third on catcher Johnson's throwing error, Lockhart singled him home, making the score 4-3. However, Glavine could not quell the Marlins in the sixth. Once again, White, Renter√≠a, and Sheffield reached base with no outs. Bonilla singled making it 5-3. After a Conine strikeout, Alou grounded into a force play, scoring Renter√≠a. Johnson then walked intentionally before Counsell singled, making it 7‚Äì3 Marlins. Brown was asked to leave the game towards the ninth, but he told Jim Leyland he wanted to continue. The Braves were able to score one in the ninth on Lockhart's single with two on, bringing Chipper Jones, who finished ninth in MVP voting, to the plate representing the tying run. However, he hit a grounder and the Marlins forced Keith Lockhart at second to give Brown a complete game victory and the first pennant for the Florida Marlins. It was the first pennant for a wild card team in Major League Baseball history.

The Diamondbacks went on to defeat the New York Yankees in seven games to win the World Series. Background The Diamondbacks won their division with a 92‚Äì70 record. The strength of their team was clearly the pitching duo of Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling. The primary weapon for Arizona on offense was Luis Gonzalez, who belted 57 home runs during the season. The Diamondbacks had outlasted the St. Louis Cardinals in the NLDS to reach their first NLCS. The Atlanta Braves won their tenth straight division title, but it had not been by a wide margin in 2001. They struggled to an 88‚Äì74 record, their worst since 1990. Greg Maddux had another big season for the Braves, winning 17 games. Chipper Jones was the leader of the Atlanta offense, batting .330 during the season to go along with his 38 home runs. After their embarrassing defeat to the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2000 NLDS, the underdog Braves blitzed the Houston Astros in the 2001 NLDS, sweeping them in three games. Summary =Arizona Diamondbacks vs. Atlanta Braves= Game summaries =Game 1= Tuesday, October 16, 2001 at Bank One Ballpark in Phoenix, Arizona The 2001 NLCS began with a pitching matchup of multiple-Cy Young Award winners Randy Johnson and Greg Maddux. Reggie Sanders plated a run in the first with a single to give Arizona a 1‚Äì0 lead. The Diamondbacks went ahead 2‚Äì0 after Luis Gonzalez drove in Craig Counsell, who doubled with two outs with a single in the fifth. Though Maddux went seven innings, Johnson pitched a complete-game three-hit shutout with 11 strikeouts. =Game 2= Wednesday, October 17, 2001 at Bank One Ballpark in Phoenix, Arizona The Braves responded to Johnson's dominating performance with one of their own from Tom Glavine. Marcus Giles led the game off with a home run for the Braves off Miguel Batista. Glavine went seven innings, scattering five hits and giving up one run in the sixth when Reggie Sanders walked with two outs and scored two batters later on Matt Williams's single. In the top of the seventh, Andruw Jones walked two outs off of Batista before Javy L√≥pez hit a two-run homer to make it 3‚Äì1. Atlanta scored five runs in the eighth with two outs to break the game open. Julio Franco singled and Chipper Jones walked off of Mike Morgan before both scored on Brian Jordan's double. Greg Swindell relieved Morgan and allowed a two-run home run to B. J. Surhoff. Bobby Witt relieved Swindell and allowed back-to-back singles to Jones and Lopez before Rey Sanchez's RBI single made it 8‚Äì1 Braves. Steve Karsay and John Smoltz pitched perfect eighth and ninth, respectively as the Braves' win tied the series 1‚Äì1 heading to Atlanta. =Game 3= Friday, October 19, 2001 at Turner Field in Atlanta Curt Schilling, who earned an MVP award in the 1993 NLCS against the Braves, got the start in Game 3 in Atlanta. Braves starter John Burkett gave up two runs in the third when Steve Finley doubled with two on. That would be all Schilling would need, as he, much like Johnson, controlled the Braves lineup. Atlanta got a run in the fourth when Marcus Giles hit a leadoff double and scored on Chipper Jones's one-out single, but with the bases loaded with one out, Steve Reed relieved Burkett and a Chipper Jones error at third base on Matt Williams's groundball allowed two runs to score. Mike Remlinger relieved Reed and allowed an RBI single to Finley. Ahead 5‚Äì1, Schilling cruised the rest of the way, tossing a complete game and striking out 12 men. =Game 4= Saturday, October 20, 2001 at Turner Field in Atlanta Looking to tie the series, Bobby Cox started Greg Maddux on short rest. For two innings, the move appeared to work. The Braves struck first off of Diamondback starter Albie Lopez when Marcus Giles walked to lead off the first and scored on RBI double by Chipper Jones. Next inning, a lead off homer by Andruw Jones made it 2‚Äì0 Braves. However, the wheels came off for Atlanta in the third when two errors, a single, and fielder's choice allowed Arizona to load the bases with two outs. Steve Finley's single scored two with Finley going to second on another error, then Matt Williams and Mark Grace hit back- to-back RBI singles to put Arizona up 4‚Äì2. Manager Bob Brenly went for the jugular in the fourth, pinch hitting David Dellucci for Lopez to lead off the inning. Dellucci singled, then Tony Womack singled before Craig Counsell hit a two-run double to left to make it 6‚Äì2. Brian Anderson, who picked up the win, pitched . The Braves scored in the seventh off of Mike Morgan on Brian Jordan's RBI single with the run charged to Anderson, but in the eighth, Arizona got the run back off of Steve Karsay when Womack singled with one out and scored on Counsell's double. The Braves loaded the bases in the bottom half on three straight leadoff singles off of Jason Marquis, but Byung-Hyun Kim in relief allowed just one run on Javy L√≥pez's double play. In the ninth, Jason Marquis struck out the first two men he faced, but a walk and error was followed by Counsell's RBI single. Luis Gonzalez's three-run homer broke the game open at 11‚Äì4 Arizona, all four runs unearned. Kim pitched a perfect bottom of the ninth as the win put Arizona firmly in control of the series, ahead three games to one with a rested Randy Johnson set to pitch. =Game 5= Sunday, October 21, 2001 at Turner Field in Atlanta Game 1 winner Randy Johnson and Game 2 winner Tom Glavine faced off as Arizona looked to advance to their first ever World Series appearance. Former Brave Danny Bautista broke a scoreless tie in the fourth by singling home Mark Grace. The Braves promptly tied the game when veteran Julio Franco led off the fourth with a home run, the first run Johnson had allowed the whole series. However, Arizona answered right back in the top of the fifth when Erubiel Durazo hit a two-out two-run blast off Glavine to make it 3‚Äì1, both runs unearned. In the seventh, Franco added another RBI with a single that made it 3‚Äì2. However, Byung-Hyun Kim came into the game and kept the Braves from getting any closer. He pitched two scoreless innings and Arizona won its first National League pennant.

Description  It usually grows in clusters, sometimes up to 20 and more stems. Its bright magenta flowers bloom in April in its southern extremes to late May at northern locations. The flowers are borne at the upper half to one third of the stem. They are funnelform in shape, up to long with dark-green stigmas. The fruit is very spiny. At first it is green, becoming pink and drying when ripe. The ripe fruit has spines which are easily detached. The seeds are black, and around a tenth of an inch in size. The stems are initially cylindrical and erect in young plants, but later with the stem base lying on the ground. The stems are usually in diameter and up to high, and obscured by heavy spines. The plants have around 10 ribs, which are somewhat flattened and tuberculate. Spines variable in color and size. Radial spines are shorter and needlelike, up to long, white and arranged in a neat rosette. Central spines number 2 to 7 and are stout, usually twisted or angular, up to long and variable in color: bright yellow, dark brown, grey, and white. Origin and Habitat: It is one of the most common species of cactus in the south-western USA (southern California, Arizona, southern Nevada, Utah) and Mexico (Baja California down to northern Baja California Sur, Sonora). Still, there are a number of varieties of Echinocereus engelmannii, and some are quite rare. Altitude: From near sea level to 2400 meters. Habitat: It grows in different dry habitats normally in well drained deserts in Sonoran and Mojave deserts, chaparral, pinyon-juniper woodlands, grass, and Great Basin shrub in flats with fine sand on the plain, washes and canyons in the desert, and also in gravelly, sandy, or rocky hillsides, and in mountain ranges. The rich flora and diverse vegetation of the area comprise, among the others, Ferocactus cylindraceus, Mammillaria boogie, Mammillaria microcarpa, Mammillaria tetrancistra, Echinocereus scopulorum, Fouquieria MacDougall, Larrea tridentata, Cercidium microphyllum, Idria columnaris, Opuntia leptocaulis, Opuntia ramosissima and Opuntia engelmannii. The species is abundant throughout its range. Land-use change is a threat affecting this species, however, it is not a major here. Uses Echinocereus engelmannii is commonly used as a landscape plant in its native areas. In pot culture it requires well aerated gritty substrate, and a hot and sunny location in the summer. In the winter the plant easily tolerates light frost and wet (if well-drained) soil. In cultivation, it usually does not bloom until it develops 2-3 branches.

Normative mineral calculations can be achieved via either the CIPW Norm or the Barth-Niggli Norm (also known as the Cation Norm). Normative calculations are used to produce an idealised mineralogy of a crystallized melt. First, a rock is chemically analysed to determine the elemental constituents. Results of the chemical analysis traditionally are expressed as oxides (e.g., weight percent Mg is expressed as weight percent MgO). The normative mineralogy of the rock then is calculated, based upon assumptions about the order of mineral formation and known phase relationships of rocks and minerals, and using simplified mineral formulas. The calculated mineralogy can be used to assess concepts such as silica saturation of melts. Because the normative calculation is essentially a computation, it can be achieved via computer programs.  CIPW Norm  The CIPW Norm was developed in the early 1900s by the petrologists Cross, Iddings, Pirsson and the geochemist Washington. The CIPW normative mineralogy calculation is based on the typical minerals that may be precipitated from an anhydrous melt at low pressure, and simplifies the typical igneous geochemistry seen in nature with the following four constraints: # The magma crystallizes under anhydrous conditions so that no hydrous minerals (hornblende, biotite) are formed. # The ferromagnesian minerals are assumed to be free of Al2O3. # The Fe/Mg ratio for all ferromagnesian minerals is assumed to be the same. # Several minerals are assumed to be incompatible, thus nepheline and/or olivine never appear with quartz in the norm. This is an artificial set of constraints, and therefore the results of the CIPW norm do not reflect the true course of igneous differentiation in nature. The primary benefit of calculating a CIPW norm is determining what the ideal mineralogy of an aphanitic or porphyritic igneous rock is. Secondly, the degree of silica saturation of the melt that formed the rock can be assessed in the absence of diagnostic feldspathoid species. The silica saturation of a rock varies not only with silica content but the proportion of the various alkalis and metal species within the melt. The silica saturation eutectic plane is thus different for various families of rocks and cannot be easily estimated, hence the requirement to calculate whether the rock is silica saturated or not. This is achieved by assigning cations of the major elements within the rock to silica anions in modal proportion, to form solid solution minerals in the idealised mineral assemblage starting with phosphorus for apatite, chlorine and sodium for halite, sulfur and FeO into pyrite, FeO and Cr2O3 is allocated for chromite, FeO and equal molar amount of TiO2 for ilmenite, CaO and CO2 for calcite, to complete the most common non-silicate minerals. From the remaining chemical constituents, Al2O3 and K2O are allocated with silica for orthoclase; sodium, aluminium and potassium for albite, and so on until either there is no silica left (in which case feldspathoids are calculated) or excess, in which case the rock contains normative quartz.  Normative and modal mineralogy  Normative mineralogy is an estimate of the mineralogy of the rock. It usually differs from the visually observable mineralogy, at least as much as the types of mineral species, especially amongst the ferromagnesian minerals and feldspars, where it is possible to have many solid solution series of minerals, or minerals with similar Fe and Mg ratios substituting, especially with water (e.g.; amphibole and biotite replacing pyroxene). However, in aphanites, or rocks with phenocrysts clearly out of equilibrium with the groundmass, a normative mineral calculation is often the best to understand the evolution of the rock and its relationship to other igneous rocks in the region.  Cautions  The CIPW Norm or Cation Norm is a useful tool for assessing silica saturation or oversaturation; estimations of minerals in a mathematical model are based on many assumptions and the results must be balanced with the observable mineralogy. The following areas create the most errors in calculations; * Cumulate rocks. While a normative mineral calculation isn't necessarily improper for use on cumulate rocks, the information gleaned is of doubtful value because a cumulate rock does not represent the melt from which it was extracted. However, if the groundmass of a cumulate can be analysed, it is valid to use a normative calculation to gain information about the parental melt. * Oxidation state. Because the normative calculation divides Fe between oxide phases and availability for silicate phases, based on estimates of the ratio of Fe2+/Fe3+, miscalculating the ratio for the rock in question may produce erroneous amounts of magnetite or hematite, or alter the silicate mineralogy. If the Fe2+/Fe3+ ratio is known for the sample, the resulting calculation should match the observed mineralogy more closely. * Pressure and temperature. Because the CIPW Norm is based on anhydrous melts and crystallisation at fairly low pressures, the resultant normative mineralogy does not reflect observed mineralogy for all rock types, especially those formed within the mantle. The normative mineralogy is not entirely accurate at reflecting the mineralogy of rocks formed at high pressures where, for instance, phlogopite may substitute for amphibole, amphibole for olivine and so forth. Altered normative calculations have been developed that more correctly reflect the particular pressure regimes of the deep crust and mantle. * Carbon dioxide. The influence of CO2 on most silicate melts is fairly minor but in some cases, especially carbonatite, but also certain lamprophyre type rocks, kimberlite and lamproite, the presence of carbon dioxide and calcite in the melt or accessory phases derives erroneous normative mineralogy. This is because if carbon is not analyzed, there is excess calcium, causing normative silica undersaturation, and increasing the calcium silicate mineral budget. Similarly, if graphite is present (as is the case with some kimberlites) this can produce excess C, and hence skew the calculation toward excess carbonate. Excess elemental C also, in nature, results in reduced oxygen fugacity and alters Fe2+/Fe3+ ratios. * Halides. The presence of some halides and non-metallic elements in the melt alter the resulting chemistry. For instance, boron forms tourmaline; excess chlorine may form scapolite instead of feldspar. This is generally rare, except in some A-type granites and related rocks. * Mineral disequilibrium. Similar to cumulate rocks, a rock may contain extraneous minerals inherited from earlier melts, or may even contain xenoliths or restite. It is improper to calculate normative mineralogy on an igneous breccia, for instance. For this reason it is not advised to utilise a CIPW norm on kimberlites, lamproites, lamprophyres and some silica-undersaturated igneous rocks. In the case of carbonatite, it is improper to use a CIPW norm upon a melt rich in carbonate. It is possible to apply the CIPW norm to metamorphosed igneous rocks. The validity of the method holds as true for metamorphosed igneous rocks as any igneous rock, and in this case it is useful in deriving an assumed mineralogy from a rock that may have no remnant protolith mineralogy remaining.

Angina is chest pain that results from episodes of transient myocardial ischemia. This can be caused by diseases such as atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease and aortic stenosis. Angina commonly arises from vasospasm of the coronary arteries. There are multiple mechanisms causing the increased smooth muscle contraction involved in coronary vasospasm, including increased Rho-kinase activity. Increased levels of Rho-kinase inhibit myosin phosphatase activity, leading to increased calcium sensitivity and hypercontraction. Rho-kinase also decreases nitric oxide synthase activity, which reduces nitric oxide concentrations. Lower levels of nitric oxide are present in spastic coronary arteries. L-type calcium channel expression increases in spastic vascular smooth muscle cells, which could result in excessive calcium influx, and hypercontraction. It was patented in 1976 and approved for medical use in 1983.  Side effects  Side effects listed in the British National Formulary include flushing, palpitations, weakness and vomiting. More recently, perianal, ileal and peristomal ulceration has been reported as a side effect. Anal ulceration is now included in the British National Formulary as a reported side effect. Other side effects include severe toothache, and nasal congestion.  Mechanism of action  Nicorandil is an anti-angina medication that has the dual properties of a nitrate and ATP-sensitive channel agonist. In humans, the nitrate action of nicorandil dilates the large coronary arteries at low plasma concentrations. At high plasma concentrations nicorandil reduces coronary vascular resistance, which is associated with increased ATP-sensitive channel (KATP) opening. Nicorandil stimulates guanylate cyclase to increase formation of cyclic GMP (cGMP). cGMP activates protein kinase G (PKG), which phosphorylates and inhibits GTPase RhoA and decreases Rho-kinase activity. Reduced Rho-kinase activity permits an increase in myosin phosphatase activity, decreasing the calcium sensitivity of the smooth muscle. PKG also activates the sarcolemma calcium pump to remove activating calcium. PKG acts on channels to promote K+ efflux and the ensuing hyperpolarization inhibits voltage-gated calcium channels. Overall, this leads to relaxation of the smooth muscle and coronary vasodilation. The effect of nicorandil as a vasodilator is mainly attributed to its nitrate property. Yet, nicorandil is effective in cases where nitrates, such as nitroglycerine, are not effective. Studies show that this is due to its KATP channel agonist action which causes pharmacological preconditioning and provides cardioprotective effects against ischemia. Nicorandil activates KATP channels in the mitochondria of the myocardium, which appears to relay the cardioprotective effects, although the mechanism is still unclear.  Society and culture   Brand names = Nicorandil is marketed under the brand names Ikorel (in the United Kingdom, Australia and most of Europe), Angedil (in Romania, Poland), Dancor (in Switzerland), Nikoran, PCA (in India), Aprior (in the Philippines), Nitorubin (in Japan), and Sigmart (in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan).

Background The first Asians documented in the Americas arrived in 1587, when Filipinos landed in California; from 1898 to 1946, the Philippines was an American possession. The next group of Asians documented in what would be the United States were Indians in Jamestown, documented as early as 1635. from In 1778, the first Chinese to reach what would be the United States, arrived in Hawaii. In 1788, the first Native Hawaiian arrived on the continental United States, in Oregon; in 1900, Hawaii was annexed by the United States. The next group of Asians documented in what would be the United States were Japanese, who arrived in Hawaii in 1806. In 1884, the first Koreans arrived in the United States. In 1898, Guam was ceded to the United States; beginning in the 1900s, Chamorros began to migrate to California and Hawaii. In 1904, what is now American Samoa was ceded to the United States; beginning in the 1920s, Samoans began to migrate to Hawaii and the continental United States, with the first Samoans documented in Hawaii in 1920. In 1912, the first Vietnamese was documented in the United States. History A former congressional staffer in the 1970s, Jeanie Jew, first approached Representative Frank Horton of the idea of designating a month to recognize Asian Pacific Americans, following the bicentennial celebrations. In June 1977 Representatives Horton, and Norman Y. Mineta, introduced a United States House of Representatives resolution to proclaim the first ten days of May as Asian-Pacific Heritage Week. A similar bill was introduced in the Senate a month later by Daniel Inouye and Spark Matsunaga. The proposed resolutions sought that May be designated for two reasons. For on May 7, 1843, the first Japanese immigrant arrived in the United States. More than two decades later, on May 10, 1869, the Golden spike was driven into the First Transcontinental Railroad, which was completed using Chinese labor. President Jimmy Carter signed a joint resolution for the celebration on October 5, 1978. =Federal legislation= \\"A joint resolution authorizing the President to proclaim annually a week during the first 10 days in May as Pacific/Asian American Heritage Week.\\" was text in House Joint Resolution 540; this resolution as well as Senate Joint Resolution 72 did not pass. Ultimately though Rep. Horton's House Joint Resolution 1007 which passed through both the House and the Senate and ultimately signed by President Jimmy Carter on October 5, 1978 to become Public Law 95-419. In 1990, George H.W. Bush signed a bill passed by Congress to extend Asian-American Heritage Week to a month; May was officially designated as Asian-Pacific American Heritage Month two years later.

He lived much of his student and professional life at Wesleyan University. Early life and education Born in Andover, Massachusetts, Higgins had his high school education at Phillips Academy, where his father taught English and his mother taught music for many years. He attended Wesleyan University and received all three of his degrees from there: a B.A. as a double major in music and history in 1962, an M.A. in musicology in 1964, and a Ph.D. in ethnomusicology in 1973. Career He founded the Indian music studies program at York University in Toronto with Trichy Sankaran in 1971, and returned to Wesleyan in 1978 as a professor of music and director of the Center for the Arts. He continually sought to strengthen the quality of Wesleyan's curriculum, and immersed himself in numerous cultural activities inside and beyond the university community. He also maintained a deep relationship with his family. Higgins was a singer of European and Western classical music. He is also recognized as the first non-Indian to perform South Indian classical Carnatic music at a high level of proficiency. He began his Indian music studies in Wesleyan courses taught by Robert E. Brown and T. Ranganathan, and was quickly captured by the subtle beauty of the art form. He decided to fully dedicate himself to learning the language of Carnatic music, and went to India on a Fulbright scholarship to learn from Ranganathan's brother, T. Viswanathan. Within a short period of time he performed to great acclaim at the Tyagaraja Aradhana, an important music festival in South India. He later continued his studies under their sister, renowned dancer T. Balasaraswati, and wrote his dissertation on the dance music of bharatanatyam. Higgins returned to India as a senior research fellow of the American Institute of Indian Studies. He continued to perform Carnatic music, recorded several albums, and due to his widely recognized sensitivity was honored with the sobriquet \\"Bhagavatar\\" (scholarly musician). He was killed by a drunken hit-and-run motorist on December 7, 1984, while walking his dog. He was planning to perform in South Africa in protest against its then racist apartheid regime. Legacy Higgins was much appreciated by Carnatic music connoisseurs across the world. His rendition of \\"Endaro Mahanubhavulu Andariki Vandanamu\\" (\\"Many are the great souls; to all of them, my salutations\\"), a famous kriti (composition) by Thyagaraja (a great composer of Carnatic music), was extraordinary considering the fact that it is a difficult kriti for even the people with knowledge of the Telugu in which the kriti is composed. Other of Higgins' most famous renditions include \\"Siva Siva Anarada,\\" \\"Krishna Nee Begane,\\" and \\"Kaa Vaa Vaa.\\" Although he mostly won the acceptance of the general Indian public during katcheris (concerts), there were some critics of his times who pointed out minor errors in pronunciation. This did not deter the master, who went on to deliver katcheri broadcasts on All India Radio. His son Nicholas Higgins is an ethnomusicologist at Sarah Lawrence College and a student of Carnatic Music. Composer Terry Riley has credited a South Indian singing demonstration by Jon Higgins as an influence on his piece A Rainbow in Curved Air from 1967. *Cowley, Julian.

The car was used by the New York City Subway until 2006. Interior of the same car A money train is one or more railcars used to collect fare collection revenue from stations on a subway system and return it to a central location for processing. This train is typically used to carry money bags guarded by transit police to deter robberies. On the New York City Subway, a ‚Äúmoney train‚Äù was first mentioned in 1905, a year after the system opened. Their trains were converted from subway cars that have been removed from service. This has since been discontinued, with the last service running in January 2006. Two of the cars went to the New York Transit Museum in Brooklyn. The use of a train was necessary because of difficulties in getting to and from stations using over-street transport, and because, since the subway reaches every station, the rail system itself can be used to collect money from ticket machines. The 1995 American crime thriller film Money Train depicts a robbery of such a train. Singapore's Mass Rapid Transit system introduced a four-car money train when the system was commissioned in 1987. Used to transfer cash trolleys from stations to a counting facility at Bishan Depot, the increased use of stored value tickets resulted in the train being decommissioned in 2007.

Second generation (2013‚Äìpresent)  Chery QQ II Rear The second generation was launched at the Shanghai auto show in 2013 and was based on a modified platform of the previous generation. The engine is a 1.0L I3 petrol derived from the 0.8L of the first QQ, for the export market (like South America) the QQ used a 1.0L flexy fuel version. From 2015 the Chery QQ was imported in Italy by DR Automobiles and rebadged as a DR Zero.DR Zero in Italy Codenamed \\"S15\\", this long-awaited redesign hit its home market in March 2013. It is based in a slightly larger QQ3-based platform, with bigger 14' inch wheels as standard and several mechanical improvements, sharing many of its components with previous models of the brand, like the A1 and the Riich M1, as a way to reduce development costs and simplify its assembly process, following a similar strategy to what was done in the Toyota Aygo/Citro√´n C1/Peugeot 107 line-up. A good example of this can be seen on the back of the car, where an enlarged glass replaces the rear door seen on the previous model. The interior habitability, design and materials were also improved, introducing for the very first time customisable upholstery and dashboard accents. The 1,000,000th Chery QQ was built on 1 September 2013, cumulative production include first and second generation, sedan QQ6 and the QQme.Chery QQ 1 million = Chery eQ (electric version) = Chery eQ The Chery eQ, a full-electric minicar based on the new generation QQ, was launched in the Chinese car market in November 2014.

He also appeared as the leading judge in the final episode of the second season of Junior MasterChef Australia. Background =Early life= Tetsuya Wakuda was born on 18 June 1959, in the city of Hamamatsu, in Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan. Wakuda made his first visit to Australia at the age of 22. =Kinsela‚Äôs and beyond (1983‚Äì1989)= In 1983, Wakuda met Sydney chef Tony Bilson (later head chef of the acclaimed Bilson's restaurant), who offered him a job preparing sushi at Kinsela‚Äôs in Taylor Square. Under Bilson, Wakuda learnt many of the classical French techniques that underpins much of Wakuda‚Äôs Japanese-French fusion cooking today. Bilson was also the first to begin fostering Wakuda‚Äôs drive to discover new flavours that has become part of Wakuda‚Äôs culinary philosophy, by encouraging him to experiment during his time at Kinsela‚Äôs. Wakuda says of his time at Kinsela's \\"At Kinsela's was where I realised I wanted to, and discovered that I could, cook. It was where I started learning classical French technique. I made up a lot of things along the way, and luckily for me, people liked the way it tasted.\\"http://www.foodtourist.com/ftguide/cookbook_review/Tetsuya_by_Tetsuya_Wakuda.htm Wakuda left Kinsela‚Äôs in 1983, and together with one of the managers from Kinsela‚Äôs set up Rose‚Äôs nightclub, where Wakuda worked as a chef for a year. After leaving Rose‚Äôs, he was introduced to chef Hans Mohr through the late restaurateur Anders Ousback. He worked as second chef with Mohr for only six months. After a short stint as head chef at Hunters Hill‚Äôs The Post and Whistle, Wakuda started Ultimo‚Äôs with a Kinsela‚Äôs head waiter Sean Dwyer in 1986. It was here that he began learning the responsibilities of operating a business. Two years later however his partner was forced to leave the business, and Wakuda decided to sell rather than take over due to the high rent and unsatisfactory location. Wakuda turned his attention to starting a new restaurant of his own together with his wife. He chose a tiny shopfront in the suburb of Rozelle as the location. Tetsuya's restaurant =Rozelle years (1989‚Äì2000)= The eponymous Tetsuya‚Äôs opened in 1989, in an unassuming space with an upstairs room located on Darling St in Sydney‚Äôs Inner-West suburb of Rozelle. Over the years, the restaurant attracted favourable reviews. In 1992 the influential The Sydney Morning Herald Good Food Guide awarded the restaurant Three Hats ‚Äì the highest possible rank. Wrote one 1990‚Äôs GFG reviewer: The restaurant was remodelled in 1993, increasing seats to 65, with an expanded and re-fitted kitchen. In November 2000 Tetsuya‚Äôs moved to a larger location in Sydney‚Äôs CBD where it remains today. =Kent Street (2000 ‚Äì present)= Tetsuya‚Äôs occupies a large, heritage-listed property on Kent St in Sydney‚Äôs CBD that once housed the former Suntory Restaurant. The restaurant seats up to 140 people, including private dining rooms and two larger main dining rooms overlooking a Japanese garden. Many of the modern sculpture works displayed around the restaurant were made by his friend, the late sculptor Akio Makigawa. The ceramics used for plating some dishes, meanwhile, are made personally for Wakuda and the restaurant by another friend Mitsuo Shoji. =Awards= Tetsuya‚Äôs has received a number of awards. The restaurant was named \\"Restaurant of the Year\\" in The Sydney Morning Herald Good Food Guide, 2008 edition. Tetsuya‚Äôs has also ranked within the top five of the World‚Äôs 50 Best Restaurants list in 2005, 2006 and 2007. In the 2010 list, Tetsuya's was ranked 38th. Tetsuya has won an award every year from 1992 to 2017.. Tetsuya was given an Order of Australia medal in The Queen's Birthday 2005 Honours List, \\"For service to the community and the development of Australian cuisine as a chef, restaurateur and author, to vocational training, and to support for charitable groups.\\" Tetsuya's signature dish Confit of Ocean Trout Tetsuya's Confit of Ocean Trout has been described as the \\"most photographed dish in the world\\".https://www.pepper.ph/quick-interview-tetsuya-wakuda-chef-behind- worlds-photographed-dish/ Charlie Trotter has said of Tetsuya ‚Äì \\"Tetsuya is part of an elite group of international chefs that has influenced other chefs through their personal styles and unique approaches to food. His culinary philosophy centres on pure, clean flavours that are decisive, yet completely refined. His amazing technique, Asian heritage, sincere humility, worldwide travels and insatiable curiosity combine to create incredible, soulful dishes that exude passion in every bite.\\" Waku Ghin restaurant In 2010, Tetsuya's second restaurant, Waku Ghin, opened in Singapore at Marina Bay Sands with an offering of a 10-course tasting menu. In 2015, it was listed as #70 on The World's 50 Best Restaurants.http://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/food/jaan- and-waku-ghin-among-the-worlds-best-100-restaurants It was subsequently awarded one Michelin star in the inaugural 2016 Singapore edition of the Michelin Guide and then two Michelin stars in 2017.

Although the track meets a high standard in terms of its facilities, it has never hosted a Formula One race. Due to the circuit ending up in financial difficulties, it has changed hands several times but still operates to this day.  History  The circuit, located within Aso Kujiyu National Park, was built at a cost of $500 million by the wealthy real-estate developer and investment banker Tomonori Tsurumaki who made headlines in 1989, when during a Paris auction, he successfully bid a Pablo Picasso painting Les Noces de Pierrette for $51.3 million from his Tokyo hotel room. Following his successful bid, he announced that his painting was to hang at the art gallery of the auto racing resort, under development at the time.Japanese Developer Buys Picasso at Record Price - New York Times The circuit was designed by Yoshitoshi Sakurai who was the project leader of the Honda F1 team during the 1960s.F1 News - Grandprix.com > GP Encyclopedia > Circuits > Nippon Autopolis Tsurumaki ordered 30 Buick powered US built single seater race cars called \\"Sabre Cars\\" for a race to take place on his circuit's grand opening, on November 1990 consisting of a mixture of invited US CART drivers such as Stan Fox, Johnny Rutherford, Dick Simon, Gary and Tony Bettenhausen, against local Japanese drivers. After the grand opening, Tsurumaki planned on a series with the cars, known as Formula Crane 45. A few races were run in 1991, with only a handful of cars competing. The only major international race held at Autopolis was the final race of the 1991 World Sportscar Championship season, the 1991 430km of Autopolis, which was won by Michael Schumacher and Karl Wendlinger in a Mercedes-Benz C291 fielded by Sauber. Autopolis first hosted a Super GT race in 1999, the season-ending exhibition race, which was won by Tom Coronel and Hidetoshi Mitsusada in a Honda NSX-GT fielded by Nakajima Racing. After a three-year absence, the circuit has regularly been hosting races in the series since 2003, although with some exceptions. Autopolis first held a Super Formula race in 2006, and with some exceptions, the track has regularly been part of the series since then. To promote the venue's intention to host a Formula One race, it sponsored the Benetton Formula One team in 1990 and 1991. The cars featured prominent Autopolis logos. Visitors criticized the track for being too remote to the hotels which required a several hours bus ride and felt that it was unsuitable for an F1 race. By then, hopes were fading, Tsurumaki turned up at the 1992 Portuguese Grand Prix. Whilst staying in Estoril, $250,000 of cash and jewels was stolen from his hotel room.

The theatre with spawned significant fame across Africa. It stands for more than 70 years of cultural life in Addis Ababa. It is a playhouse where modern Ethiopian music and drama were born and nurtured. Many stars like Aster Aweke, Tilahun Gessesse and Frew Hailu began their careers on the stage of Hager Fikir Theatre. Both traditional Ethiopian plays and translations of plays by William Shakespeare, Friedrich Schiller, Henrik Ibsen and Moli√®re have been produced at Hager Fikir Theatre in recent decades. History Hager Fikir Theatre was founded in 1935, when people of Addis Ababa founded \\"Hager Fikir Maheber\\" (Association for the love of the Motherland) to stand against the upcoming Italian invasion. The founder, Makonnen Habte-Wold, wanted to encourage the patriotic mettle of the Ethiopian people. The first open-air productions took place at Menelik Square, the city centre of Addis Ababa. Although the Italian occupation could not be prevented, Hager Fikir Theatre survived. However, there were few uncritical and fascist- friendly plays brought on stage during the period of occupation. After the withdrawal of the Italian troops in 1941 the theatre-crew moved from Menelik Square to the place where it is located nowadays in the Piazza district. A former Italian nightclub was reconstructed as a theatre hall. At the 25th anniversary of Haile Selassie‚Äôs reign in 1955 the main entrance of the hall was enlarged and an imperial balcony and lounge was built. During the rule of Haile Selassie the Hager Fikir Theatre grew, although the Emperor established the Haile-Selassie-Theatre (today the National Theatre) as an additional theatre in Addis Ababa. The Hager Fikir Theatre continued as a popular theatre for the common people of the city whereas the Haile-Selassie-Theatre was mainly visited by high class society. Besides regular performances the Hager Fikir Theatre also broadcast live radio shows on Ethiopian radio. Moreover the troop went on tour regularly, so that people from rural Ethiopia also could have access to the productions of Hager Fikir. After Haile Selassie and during the Derg Regime the Hager Fikir Theatre continued to produce socialistic plays and performances. Musicians and actors were mostly controlled and the work of the directors was censured by the government. In 1975, the then director Tesfaye Gesesse was arrested for his play \\"Iqaw\\" (\\"The Thing\\"). It was said to be anti-Derg and anti-revolutionary. After the downfall of the Derg Regime in 1991, the Hager Fikir Theatre continued its work. Nowadays, more than 100 people work for the theatre, among these are around 40 actors and singers. Movie performances are on schedule most of the days. Theatre plays are performed on weekend and musical shows are on stage on public holidays.

He is artistic director of the Moscow Theatre \\"School of Dramatic Arts\\", Th√©√¢tre de l'Europe, and professor of drama in Lyon, France. Early years Vasiliev was born in the Soviet Union and graduated from the faculty of chemistry at Rostov State University. In 1973, he received a degree in directing from the State Institute of Dramatic Art (GITIS), where he first worked with painter and sceneographer Igor Popov. This collaboration would continue throughout most of Vasiliev's professional life. As director-Intern for the institute, he staged A Solo for a Clock with Chimes, which first brought him to the attention of Moscow theatre-goers. Subsequent productions of The First Draught of Vassa Zheleznova, in 1978, and The Grown Daughter of a Young Man, in 1979, (both staged at the Stanislavski Theatre) sealed his fame in the theatre community. Taganka Theatre and School of Dramatic Arts Vasiliev and the group of actors that had gathered around him left the Stanislavski theatre in 1982. In 1985, Yuri Petrovich Lyubimov invited him to work at the Taganka Theatre. The result was that Vasiliev directed a production of Cerceau, by Victor Slavkin, which was voted best performance for the 1985‚Äì1986 Moscow theatre season. In 1987, Vasiliev founded the theatre \\"School of Dramatic Art\\", bringing with him many of the actors who had worked with him at the Stanislavski Theatre. The theatre's website sums up Vasiliev's vision for the theatre as follows: \\"The theatre 'School of Dramatic Art' created by Anatoly Vasiliev is a unique model of theatre from the point of view of its artistic, intellectual, professional and ethic relations. The concept of the 'theatre ‚Äì laboratory' gives the opportunity to make the research and experiment.\\" Since its formation, Vasiliev has taken the theatre company on frequent tours, traveling to numerous cities around the world. Among these have been Berlin, Belgrade, Brussels, Budapest, Helsinki, London, Munich, Paris, Rome, Rotterdam, and Stuttgart. Later years Now in his 70s, Vasiliev still directs and takes an active part in the workings of the theatre. In 2010 Vasiliev started a three- year course for the training of theatre pedagogists. The course is based in Venice, takes place during two months each year and is mainly for Italian professionals but also combines pedagogists, actors and directors from all over the world. In mid-2011 Vasiliev began a Research seminary on acting techniques at the Grotowski Institute in Wroc≈Çaw, Poland. The seminary lasted two years and combined graduates of the Venice program and actors from various European countries. In 2016 Vasiliev will return to direct, for the first time in seven years, the play La Musica deuxi√®me by French playwright Marguerite Duras, at the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise in Paris. He is aided by his long time collaborator Natacha Isaeva, researcher of theatre and translator, and Boaz Trinker, actor-training specialist graduated from the Venice program. Recognition Vasiliev was awarded the Laureate of Russian Stanislavsky Premium in 1988, he received the Order of the Cavalier of Art and Literature from France in 1989, the Premio Europa Nuove Realt√† Teatrali of the Europe Theatre Prize in Taormina, Italy, in 1990, and the Chaos and Pirandello prizes in Agrigento, Italy, in 1992. In 1993, he received the Honoured Art Worker of Russia award, followed in 1995 by the Laureate of the Premium of Stanislasky Fund award for contributions in developing theatre pedagogics. With Igor Popov, he received the 1999 State Premium of Russia award in the field of Literature and Art for the creation of Moscow theatre School of Dramatic Art, and the 2001 National Premium \\"Triumph\\" award. In December 2012 he was awarded the prestigious Italian UBU award, for his three-year Island of Pedagogy project (2010‚Äì2012) in Venice.

These small to medium-sized bottom-dwelling sharks are found mostly in, but are not limited to, the area around the southern seas of Australia and is commonly baited and fished for cuisine because of its taste and market prices. Appearance This species is a slender shark with a darker grey top with white spots and a slivery-white underbelly. The gummy shark gets its name from its flat, plate-like teeth which it uses to crush its shelled and non- shelled prey. Male gummy sharks can reach a maximum length of 157 cm, and females can reach up to 175 cm. The minimum size of a grown male or female is 45 cm. At birth, these sharks measure between 30 and 35 cm. Said measurements are taken from the rear-most gill slit to the base of the tail fin.  Hunting and Habitat  The gummy shark feeds on crustaceans, marine worms, small fish, and cephalopods such as octopus, squid and cuttlefish. . It uses its plate-like teeth to help it crush the shells and bodies of its prey for easier consumption. The gummy shark remains on or near the sea beds, and their travel patterns vary on age. Juvenile gummy sharks will travel less than full grown species. The females tend to travel longer ranges compared to males. Gummy sharks are primarily found to live in sandy areas and will come closer to shores during the night in search of prey.  Geography  The gummy shark is primarily found living on the southern coast of Australia around Bunbury including but not limited to the island of Tasmania and Bass Straight. Gummy sharks are also found in coastal areas of the Pacific ocean such as Japan, as well as coastal areas of the Indian ocean. Reproductive tendencies Gummy sharks are found to be mostly bottom dwellers in the waters around southern Australia, from Shark Bay in Western Australia to Port Stephens in New South Wales, from the surface down to a depth of 350 metres in moderate-temperature water. The reproduction of the single-sex school gummy sharks is ovoviviparous. Ovoviviparous organisms are those who produce young via egg which are then hatched inside of the parents' bodies. A common example of an ovoviviparous animal is a seahorse. Gummy sharks have an ovulation and mating period that lasts about three months from November-Frebruary. The gestation period in this species is between eleven to twelve months. The embryos can get to be thirty to thirty-six centimeter total in length. Pregnant gummy sharks will rely on inshore nursery areas such as a bay or sheltered space close to shore to have her pups. Females can have up to 57 pups per litter and are ready to do so by the age of five. The average number of pups per litter birthed by the female Mustelus antarcticus is 14 but can have up to 57. The sex ratio in the embryos is 1:1. Male sharks are ready to reproduce by the age of four. The typical generation length for the gummy shark is 10 years and have an average life expectancy of 16 years.  Predators and Human Interaction  Mustelus antarcticus pose no known threat to beach goers or fisherman. Because of gummy sharks bottom dwelling habitat, they have minimal contact with humans, and they tend to flee when spotted, hence why observational studies of this species is difficult. Gummy sharks have only 2 known predators. One is humans, who catch them for consumption and sport-fishing. The other main predator is the broadnose sevengill shark, which preys on juveniles who remain close to shallow waters. Fishing and consumption Gummy sharks are of the more highly targeted fish for human consumption. Gummy shark meat is often marketed as \\"flake\\" in southern Australia. Their boneless fillets have made them particularly popular within the fish and chip industry throughout Australia.[1] Although gummy sharks have not been over-fished, they inhabit many of the same areas as school (snapper) sharks which have an established bycatch quota. This means fishers targeting gummy shark cannot have an adverse impact on the school shark population.[2] Due to new fishing gear, the growth rate of gummy sharks between three to seven years of age have decreased. However, gummy sharks around the age of two are least affected by fisheries. This species is also of least concern in terms of endangerment according to the IUCN Red List, which is an extensive list of species that organizes where they fall on the endangered scale from ‚ÄúLeast concern‚Äù (LC) to ‚ÄúExtinct‚Äù (EX). According to SharkSmart, roughly one hundred gummy sharks are tagged with internal acoustic tags in Western Australia to yield information about possible migration and travel habits. Bag limits for recreational fishers in Victoria, Australia apply. Bag limits are laws placed on fisherman and hunters to limit the number of specific species they are allowed to catch, kill and/or keep. Fishermen have both a bag and a possession limit of two shark and/or school shark, landed whole or as a carcass. There is a five-shark limit for large boats. If caught these sharks must be released if it is in total no larger than 75 cm or roughly two and a half feet.

Accreditation  The school is accredited by EduQuahttps://alice.ch/fr/services/eduqua/institutions-certifiees/, the first Swiss quality label geared towards providers of adult learning programmes. The label promotes transparency and comparability of adult learning for the benefit of consumers and contributes to safeguarding the quality of adult education programmers in Switzerland.https://genevadiplomacy.ch/admissions/faq-frequently-asked- questions/. However, it is not formally accredited before the Swiss public higher education sector. Switzerland is currently introducing accreditation procedures that draw no distinction between public and private institutions. Accreditation under the Federal Act of September 30, 2011, on the Funding and Coordination of the Higher Education Sector (HEdA, SR 414.20) attests to the fact that the public authorities have conducted an external quality inspection, may recognise the institutions but do not provide them with public subsidies.https://www.sbfi.admin.ch/content/dam/sbfi/en/dokumente/2017/12/titel- privater-institutionen.pdf  Memberships  The school is a member of the Association genevoise des √©coles priv√©es and the Swiss Federation of Private Schools.

The Bronocice pot, discovered in a village in Gmina Dzia≈Çoszyce, ≈öwietokrzyskie Voivodeship in Ma≈Çopolska, near Nida River, Poland, is a ceramic vase incised with one of the earliest known depictions of what may be a wheeled vehicle. It was dated by the radiocarbon method to the mid-fourth millennium BC, and is attributed to the Funnelbeaker archaeological culture. Today it is housed in the Archaeological Museum of Krak√≥w (Muzeum Archeologiczne w Krakowie), Poland. Discovery The pot was discovered between 1974 and 1976 during the archaeological excavation of a large Neolithic settlement in Bronocice by the Nidzica River, ca. 50 km to north east of Krak√≥w. The excavations were carried out between 1974 and 1980 by the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnology, Polish Academy of Sciences and the State University of New York at Buffalo (United States). Sarunas Milisauskas, one of several archaeologists who worked on Bronocice excavation project wrote: \\"The 1974 field season yielded data beyond our expectations. An incised wagon motif was found on a Funnel Beaker vessel in a pit. An animal bone associated with the pot in the pit was dated by radiocarbon method, around 3400 BC (Bakker et al. 1999). The vessel represents one of the earliest pieces of evidence for the presence of wheeled wagons in Europe.\\" Milisauskas, together with Janusz Kruk, attributed the Neolithic Bronocice findings to the Lublin-Volhynian culture (between 3100 and 2200 BC), \\"contemporary to the younger stage of the development of Tiszapolgar cycle in the Cisa River Basin... the culture is certainly older than the decadent period of the Funnelbeaker culture in Ma≈Çopolska.\\" Inscription The picture on the pot symbolically depicts key elements of the prehistoric human environment. The most important component of the decoration are five rudimentary representations of what seems to be a wagon. They represent a vehicle with a shaft for a draught animal, and four wheels. The lines connecting them probably represent axles. The circle in the middle possibly symbolizes a container for harvest. Other images on the pot include a tree, a river and what may be fields intersected by roads/ditches or the layout of a village. The Bronocice pot inscription markings may represent a kind of \\"pre-writing\\" symbolic system that was suggested by Marija Gimbutas in her model of Old European language, similar to Vinƒça culture logographics (5700‚Äì4500 BC). Historical implications Position of Bronocice The image on the pot is one of the oldest well-dated representations of a four-wheeled vehicle in the world.Anthony (2007), p. 67. It suggests the existence of wagons in Central Europe as early as in the late 4th millennium BC. They were presumably drawn by aurochs whose remains were found with the pot. Their horns were worn out as if tied with a rope, possibly a result of using a kind of yoke.David W. Anthony, 2007 Based on Bronocice discovery, several researchers (Asko Parpola and Christian Carpelan),Parpola, 2005 pointed out that \\"Indo-European languages possess inherited vocabulary related to wheeled transport\\", thus providing new research information about the origin of the Indo-European. They argue that \\"the wheeled vehicles were first invented around the middle of the fourth millennium BC.\\" In his review Theoretical Structural Archeology, Geoff Carter, writes: \\"The site was occupied during the Funnel Beaker or TBR culture phase, one of a complex group of cultures that succeeded the LBK in northern Europe, in the Fifth and Fourth Millennia BC. Bones from the pit in which the pot was found gave radiocarbon dates of around 3635-3370 BC\\". This makes it contemporaneous with the earliest depictions of wheeled wagons found on clay tablet pictographs at the Eanna district of Uruk, in the Sumerian civilization of Mesopotamia (modern Iraq), dated c. 3500‚Äì3350 BC. Several historians argue that there was a diffusion of the wheeled vehicle from the Near East to Europe around the mid-4th millennium BC.
