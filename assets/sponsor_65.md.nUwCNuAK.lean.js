Coll√®ge des Bernardins, it houses the Acad√©mie catholique de France. On July 11, 2008, a first meeting was held, bringing together personalities from magazines, associations and faculties. On October 13, 2008, a small committee was held at the Coll√®ge des Bernardins in Paris, which decided on the definitive name \\"Acad√©mie catholique de France\\" and its head office at this address. In January 2009, the new office was made up of the priest and philosopher Philippe Capelle-Dumont (chairman), the professor of immunologic medicine Edgardo D. Carosella and Father Jean-Robert Armogathe (vice-presidents) and professor and philosopher Pierre Manent organized a first meeting during which the statutes and rules of procedure were adopted. In March 2009 the first meeting of the \\"Scientific Council\\" was held and the first members of the \\"academic body\\" were elected. Inspired by the Catholic Academy of Mainz, in Germany, the French Catholic Academy is composed of 70 clerics and laymen. The \\"academic body\\" has 84% lay people. Reasons and motivations of this initiative Due to the number of scandals perpetuated by a minority of the 20th century clergy and the growing Republican anti-Catholic feeling in France, Nathalie Nabert, medievalist and poet, honorary dean of the Faculty of Letters of the Catholic Institute of Paris, a member of the \\"academic body\\", admits that his commitment is a courageous challenge. However, she adds that the creation of a \\"Catholic Academy of France\\", supported by the Faculty of Catholic Theology and the French School of Jerusalem (√âcole biblique et arch√©ologique fran√ßaise de Jerusalem), is a serious and urgent matter. Indeed, the death of Ren√© R√©mond appeared to some as the end of the \\"Catholic intellectual\\". There were no longer any spaces for discussion where men of faith and combat had opposed torture in Algeria during the war. R√©mond was one of those Catholics engaged in political life who ensured a triple mediation between the Church, the Catholic laity and the secularized society. Ren√© R√©mond himself alarmed as early as 2000 of the silence of Catholic intellectuals in public debate.Ren√© R√©mond, Le Christianisme en accusation : entretiens avec Marc Leboucher, Descl√©e de Brouwer, 2000, 159 pages The creation of the \\"Acad√©mie catholique de France\\" therefore responds to a need: to work to transmit the Christian heritage, to be open and creative.La Croix, quotidien n¬∞ 38467, ¬´ Cinq membres du nouveau corps acad√©mique ¬ª, ¬´ Nathalie Nabert, cr√©ativit√© et ouverture de l'Acad√©mie ¬ª, Article du , .

Both nations are members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Forum of East Asia‚ÄìLatin America Cooperation. History =Early relations= Early knowledge of Japan and Peru would have been through Spanish merchants who traded via the Manila Galleon from Acapulco, Mexico and Manila, Philippines as well as through Spanish missionaries. In Manila, the Spanish traded with Japanese merchants and brought their products to Spanish America (as Peru was part of the Spanish Empire at the time). In 1821, Peru declared its independence from Spain and in October 1868, Japan entered the Meiji period and began fostering diplomatic relations with several nations, after decades of isolation. Prior to establishing formal diplomatic relations; in June 1872, Japan and Peru had a diplomatic incident when a Peruvian ship called the Mar√≠a Luz set sail from Macau to Callao carrying 232 Chinese indentured labourers for Peruvian plantations. On the way to Peru, the ship encountered a severe storm which caused some damage to the ship and called on the Japanese port of Yokohama for repairs. At port, one Chinese laborer managed to escape and jumped to shore. Once on shore, the laborer complained about severe mistreatment and asked for protection and the rescue of his fellow laborers on board. After a second laborer escaped from the ship, Japanese authorities boarded the ship and discovered that the Chinese nationals were being confined against their will under inhumane conditions. Many had been kidnapped, and most had no idea of the location of their final destination. The Japanese courts charged the captain, Ricardo Herrera, of the Mar√≠a Luz with wrongdoing and in violation of international law and set free the Chinese nationals.El Per√∫ contra el Imper√≠o del Sol Naciente (in Spanish) A year later, in 1873, Japan and Peru formally established diplomatic relations by signing a Treaty of Friendship and Navigation. In 1899, 790 Japanese migrants, aboard the Sakuramaru arrived to Peru. Most of the migrants came to the country to work on the various plantations.Japanese-Peruvians- Reviled and Respected: The Paradoxial Place of Peru's Nikkei By 1936, 23,000 Japanese migrants immigrated to Peru. During World War II, Peruvians sacked, looted, and burned more than 600 Japanese homes and businesses in Lima, killing 10 Japanese and injuring dozens. In January 1942, Peru broke diplomatic relations with Japan over the Attack on Pearl Harbor. Soon afterwards, Peru deported over 1,700 Japanese Peruvians to the United States where they were placed in internment camps after growing pressure from the U.S. to secure Latin America from \\"dangerous enemy aliens.\\" After the war, Peru re-established diplomatic relations with Japan and in 1959, Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi paid an official visit to Peru. In 1961, Peruvian President Manuel Prado Ugarteche became the first Peruvian and Latin- American head of state to visit Japan.Rese√±a Hist√≥rica (in Spanish) =Presidency of Alberto Fujimori= Monument to the Japanese embassy hostage crisis in Lima In July 1990, Alberto Fujimori became the first Peruvian President of Japanese origin.

During the siege, supreme court judge Carlos Giusti died in the operation and two soldiers were killed. Japanese Prime Minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, thanked Peru for the release of the hostagesHostages freed as troops storm Lima embassy In November 2000, President Fujimori flew to Brunei to attend the 12th APEC summit. After the summit, he flew to Japan and faxed his resignation of the Presidency as a corruption scandal was collapsing his government. In Japan, Fujimori requested and was granted Japanese citizenship based on his origins. The Peruvian government, under President Alejandro Toledo requested Japan to extradite Fujimori to face 20 criminal charges, however, Japan refused to extradite one of its citizens, which harmed relations between both nations. In 2006, Fujimori left Japan and flew to Mexico and Chile where he was arrested. He was trying to return to Peru to run for President.Peru's Fugitive Ex-President Is Arrested in Chile =Post Fujimori= In the 1990s Japan changed their immigration law and allowed the return of \\"Dekasegi\\" (people of Japanese origin born abroad) to return to Japan and receive permanent residency.

The account, its author, and the character associated with the tweets are all commonly referred to as dril (the account's identifier on Twitter) or wint (the account's display name), both rendered lowercase but often capitalized by others. Since his first tweet in 2008, dril has become a popular and influential Twitter user with more than 1.5 million followers. dril is one of the most notable accounts associated with \\"Weird Twitter\\", a subculture on the site that shares a surreal, ironic sense of humor. The character associated with dril is highly distinctive, often described as a bizarre reflection of a typical male American Internet user. Other social media users have repurposed dril's tweets for humorous or satiric effect in a variety of political and cultural contexts. Many of dril's tweets, phrases, and tropes have become familiar parts of Internet slang. The author behind dril remained unknown for years, with the few available details about the author's life fueling speculation about his identity. In 2017, dril's author was \\"doxxed\\", exposing his identity in a post that went viral and received media attention. After the doxxing, many Twitter users and journalists preferred to preserve dril's pseudonymity out of respect for the author's personal privacy and the character's mystique. Beyond tweeting, dril has created animated short films and contributed illustrations and writing to other artists' collaborative projects. His first book, Dril Official \\"Mr. Ten Years\\" Anniversary Collection (2018), is a compilation of the account's \\"greatest hits\\" alongside new illustrations. In 2019 he announced the launch of a streaming web series called Truthpoint: Darkweb Rising, an InfoWars parody co-created with comedian Derek Estevez-Olsen for Adult Swim. Writers have praised dril for the originality and humor of his tweets; for example, the poet Patricia Lockwood called dril \\"a master of tone [and] character\\".  Biography and identity  Before the Twitter account, dril was a poster at the Something Awful forums under the name \\"gigantic drill\\". According to former Something Awful admin David Thorpe, dril was \\"just a guy who was posting funny stuff on there\\", but never one of the site's featured front page writers. dril posted his first tweet‚Äîthe single word \\"no\\"‚Äîon September 15, 2008. dril then remained silent on Twitter for nine months before his second tweet‚Äî\\"how do i get cowboy paint off a dog .\\"‚Äîand has posted regularly in the years since. Initially, little was known about the anonymous author of the dril account. When asked about the account's anonymity during a private Q&A; in 2017, dril responded \\"i am an almost 30 year old man and i could not really care less about the platform i use to convey dick jokes.\\" Jacob Bakkila, one of the writers behind the @Horse ebooks Twitter account, claimed in 2013 that dril had once hired him for a project. Bakkila told BuzzFeed that dril's author was a graphic designer living somewhere in the New York metropolitan tri-state area. BuzzFeeds John Herrman and Katie Notopoulos speculated that dril may be a collaborative project or that Bakkila himself was behind dril. Bakkila denied the rumor that he was dril, adding that dril was \\"a friend\\" who had contributed to the @Horse_ebooks sequel, Bear Stearns Bravo. = Doxing incident = On November 16, 2017, a Tumblr post identifying dril's author by his real name went viral. Other posts identifying dril's author existed as early as 2014 on Tumblr, Twitter, and Reddit, but these earlier posts had not gone viral or been publicized in the media. The 2017 post identified dril through \\"informed guesswork\\" founded on other clues, including a LinkedIn page associated with Bear Stearns Bravo and a writing credit on Hiveswap, an adventure game set in the universe of Andrew Hussie's long-running webcomic Homestuck. The Tumblr post was described by the press as a \\"doxing\\": an unwelcome broadcasting of private personal information online. The post was met with backlash and dismay among Twitter users, many of whom voiced a preference for keeping dril's personal identity a mystery and preserving the author's privacy. According to Jozefien Wouters, writing for the Belgian news magazine Knack: The author addressed the doxing on his Patreon page, writing \\"everything's normal. i guess im 'doxxed' now. sorry. it's fine. i donr really give a shit.\\" In a Reddit \\"ask us anything\\" interview, dril confirmed that he had worked on Hiveswap. He said the personal impact of the doxing had been minimal, adding that people had been \\"surprisingly normal\\" and he had no \\"sordid past\\" to hide, but also described being outed as \\"my Cross to bear\\" and said \\"theres nothing scandalous enough there to make it worth publicizing and looking like an ass hole while doing so.\\" In August 2018, dril announced that he was transferring the publishing rights to his tweets to Paul Dochney, whom he called his \\"Agent And Master\\", for the purpose of publishing his first book. Some reporters subsequently identified dril as Dochney. Character The author behind the @dril account writes in character, using an avatar of a blurry image of Jack Nicholson smiling and wearing sunglasses. Although there is no clear narrative, dril's \\"voice\\" or \\"character\\", generally understood to be male, is consistently recognizable. Writer Alexander McDonough called dril a \\"grinning Jack Nicholson with severe persecution and self-esteem issues, poor physical health, and a bizarre love/hate relationship with cops.\\" Bijan Stephen at The Verge likened dril to an online version of the \\"wise fool\\" stock character. Critics have described dril's voice as an amalgamation of ordinary Internet users, most of all those who are arrogant, obsessive, ignorant, or hapless. Professor of English literature Roger Bellin describes the character of dril as \\"generally a recognizable type: a self-important buffoon who's often raging out (show yourself, coward), or other times preening (buddy, they won't even let me), over some bit of nonsense that we re all meant to realize is absurdly unimportant.\\" Vice reviewer Rachel Pick describes dril as \\"a bumbling, maladapted fool ... a pudgy, oily man, frequently in a state of undress, who doesn‚Äôt go through life as much as he is spilled across it.\\" According to The A.V. Clubs Clayton Purdom, dril is a sort of patron saint of Internet users, or \\"your uncle's search history come to life and filtered through a scabrous comic sensibility, and ... possibly the most popular, beloved man on the entire internet (after, maybe, The Rock).\\" Will Shaw of The Oxford Student noted the familiarity of dril's \\"naive appeals to moderation\\" and \\"flame war posturing\\", and said dril the character \\"is the internet's collective id, given form\\", while the writer behind @dril is \\"the internet equivalent of the Beowulf-poet; we may never know who he really is, but we recognise when he is being channelled.\\" Christine Erickson at Mashable said dril's character was like \\"a spambot equivalent to the kind of crazy that Clint Eastwood portrays\\". At Kotaku, Gita Jackson called dril a \\"joke account that also inadvertently catalogues ... every way to be mad online\\". In a lecture given at the University of Pennsylvania, American poet Patricia Lockwood described dril as a literary alter ego of Twitter users and the Internet in general. Comparing the account's persona to Ignatius J. Reilly, the protagonist of John Kennedy Toole's novel A Confederacy of Dunces (1980), Lockwood cited dril as an example of new possibilities in first-person narrative that could be explored online. Lockwood said of dril: dril's tweets are, in the words of Jordan Sargent at Gawker, a series of \\"quietly seething and unhinged avant-garde scribblings\\". His tweets are deliberately peppered with odd typos like misspelled words, grammatical mistakes, punctuation errors, and eggcorns. Yohann Koshy in Vice said dril's writing \\"reads like obscene nonsense verse‚Äîthe syntax mutilated, the humour irredeemable\\". In the preface to his first book, dril called his writing style \\"Prestige Short Prose\\". Pick suggested that the phrase was likely \\"meant to make fun of the snobby lit theory types who want to make Dril out to be some highbrow art project\\", but she concluded it was an apt term to describe dril's style of \\"part art form, part jokes to read on the toilet\\". Pick also compared dril's writing to the surreal one-liner jokes of Jack Handey and the flash fiction short story \\"For sale: baby shoes, never worn\\". Jonah Engel Bromwich, in The New York Times, said dril was a major influence on the spread of dialogue, written in the same method as screenwriting, as a comedic writing style on Twitter. dril has been identified as one of the \\"most revered\\" and \\"quintessential\\" accounts associated with the \\"Weird Twitter\\" scene, a loose subculture of associated users who share a surreal, ironic, subversive sense of humor. dril was one of many Weird Twitter personalities who migrated to Twitter from Something Awful's FYAD board and carried over the forum's in- jokes and tone. Like others on Weird Twitter, dril's tweets have been described as having a dadaist sensibility. Writing for Complex, Brenden Gallagher compared dril to a musician who refuses to sell out or an auteurist indie filmmaker, as Twitter's version of \\"the enigmatic figure that even [an art form's] best known practitioners look to with reverence\\". Sean T. Collins described dril's humor as a \\"blend of fist-on-the-table bluster, abject confusion and burned-toast syntax\\", noting the influence of surreal humor found in Monty Python (especially the sketches from their show Monty Python's Flying Circus and Terry Gilliam's animations) and Adult Swim shows like Space Ghost Coast to Coast and Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! Collins called dril's tweets \\"a new way to be funny, with a rhythm and vocabulary all their own. I love it.\\" = Motivation and satirical elements = Most of dril's writing is understood to be absurd, surreal, ironic, or nonsensical. An article about dril in The Oxford Student singled out this 2011 dril tweet as the account's guiding \\"manifesto\\": Providing a (supposedly) out-of-character statement to BuzzFeed for an oral history on \\"Weird Twitter\\", dril commented on the nature of his work and motivation: Dan Hitchens at Christian journal First Things noted, in an article about the use of irony on social media, that \\"[m]uch of the art of Twitter consists in appearing to put forward a position while giving the impression that you might be kidding\\", citing American author David Foster Wallace's warnings about the pervasiveness of irony in modern culture. According to Hitchens, dril is the \\"cult account that towers above the rest\\" in his mastery of irony, and dril's \\"inspired errors in spelling, logic, and decorum can only be produced by a clever creator, but the creator never lets the mask slip. Half the joke is our joint awareness of @dril's lack of self-awareness.\\" Although dril's content is typically absurd or nonsensical, some have noted an undercurrent of satire or social commentary in dril's tweets. Surveying Weird Twitter for Complex, Gallagher commented that dril's \\"vicious satire of conservatives, gamers, conspiracy theorists, and other less savory aspects of the Internet is always on point, always hilarious, always in character.\\" Fellow Weird Twitter user @rare_basement said dril's \\"trolling [of] Penn State fans during the molestation scandal was so brilliant, always on the right side of the issue, but super funny and subtle about it.\\" Although dril does not avow an explicit political identity, the account's politics are generally identified as leftist, an alignment common among Weird Twitter users. However, the abstraction and vagueness of dril's tweets have allowed them to be spread and repurposed by people of varying ideologies across the political spectrum. Celebrities, journalists, and former members of both Republican and Democratic presidential administrations follow dril, and even the far-right Breitbart News has quoted dril on its Twitter feed.  Influence  = Impact on Internet slang = References to dril's tweets have become part of the vernacular of Internet slang. Some of dril's distinctive phrases have become so ubiquitous that they are used even by those who are unaware of the phrases' origin. Although dril's biggest influence is on Twitter, his tweets are also popular on other social media platforms‚Äîfor example, meme-aggregating groups on Facebook commonly share his content, and several Tumblr users and trends have referenced and been influenced by dril. There was a Know Your Meme guide to dril in 2014, at a time when KYM pages for individual Twitter users would have been comparatively rare. A common piece of conventional wisdom on Twitter holds that it's possible to find a dril tweet that corresponds to virtually any situation or statement. As an example, the dril tweet below has been widely referenced after a person apologizes for making a dramatically offensive and obviously incorrect statement: As described by Purdom, finding the dril tweet that matches an event or statement has become an online parlor game, made possible because dril had \\"rendered a tightly written comedic exaggeration of every daily outrage and conflict from the news cycle in which we find ourselves trapped.\\" Purdom also found that dril's early preoccupations and sensibility had an outsized, \\"Velvet Underground-like influence on the tenor of the internet to come.\\" By the end of 2017, the staff of Deadspin declared that \\"comparing everything to @dril\\" was a trend that \\"should die\\" in 2018, asserting that dril himself remained funny but dril comparisons had become an overused, lazy trope, because too many Twitter users were relying on dril references \\"as a substitute for an actual joke.\\" As of 2020, Dril's first tweet, \\"no\\", was used by dril as his \\"pinned tweet\\", a feature of Twitter that allows one tweet the user considers to be particularly important to be \\"pinned\\" out of chronological order at the top of a Twitter feed. Despite, or because of, its lack of context, it has amassed thousands of likes and retweets. According to Will Oremus at Slate, the popularity of the \\"no\\" tweet is an example of how \\"The metadata is the message\\" on social media, as metrics like retweets provide important context and carry independent meaning, akin to a laugh track on TV. = Satirical recontextualization = Other social media users frequently quote, recontextualize, or remix dril tweets for their own satirical purposes, and some accounts are even exclusively dedicated to this purpose. One such account, @EveryoneIsDril, shares screenshots of tweets by other people that sound like dril's voice. Another, \\"wint MP\\" or @parliawint, attached dril tweets styled like teletext closed captions to images from BBC News of British politicians and journalists speaking. Although seemingly niche, the wint MP account garnered 14,000 followers by May 2017. \\"tom dissonance\\", the creator of wint MP, attributed the account's success to its functioning as a joke on multiple levels, and for multiple audiences: \\"there are people who get the in- jokey references; there's a broader level of people who get politics and dril, and understand the significance of one commenting on another; and beyond that there are people who just appreciate an official figure in a suit saying something ridiculous. It's an onion of silliness.\\" Koshy commented that wint MP \\"stands out from traditional forms of satire because it has no normative force. It recommends nothing about the way things should be. The political field it presents is slack-jawed, demented, putrid and amoral ‚Äì there is no value beyond the scope of its image.\\" Not all satirical riffing on dril is political in nature; for example, the account @drilmagic attracted thousands of followers presenting mashups of dril tweets and cards from the game Magic: The Gathering. Ben Wilinofsky, a card player who contributed to @drilmagic, said the account and its format became a success because \\"Magic has a very self-serious lore that is great foil for an account that so often has the self-serious in its crosshairs.\\" Several attempts have been made to create AI text generators (often manually curated) that create messages in the style of dril tweets. =Comparisons to Donald Trump= Screenshot of a Donald Trump video post on Facebook with a typo. Commentators have frequently drawn comparisons between Trump's social media presence and dril. There are several people whose voices on social media are often compared to dril's‚Äîthe musician and actor Ice-T is one‚Äîbut Donald Trump is likely the most common comparison. Commentators have frequently compared dril to Trump (and vice versa), particularly Trump's voice on Twitter and other social media platforms. According to Purdom, \\"Both are aging, endlessly aggrieved white men who seemingly do not understand core components of the internet, yet they perfectly embody its anonymous rage, its ability to turn people into lunatics being swarmed and eaten alive by enemies and trolls.\\" In a 2016 article for New York magazine, Brian Feldman argued that Trump should choose dril as his vice-presidential running mate‚Äîa position that was later filled by then- Governor of Indiana Mike Pence‚Äîbecause the writer perceived commonalities between dril's \\"incoherent, libidinous, authoritarian comment-spam\\" and Trump's own campaign tweeting. In a joke about Trump's use of social media, journalist and MSNBC host Chris Hayes said that protestors should yell at Trump to log off to \\"see if they can get him to recreate that @dril tweet\\", a reference to the following: Eve Peyser, in a Gizmodo article declaring the 2016 presidential election was \\"the Weird Twitter election\\", had earlier compared the same dril tweet to the \\"tone, structure and message\\" of a Trump tweet. David Covucci at The Daily Dot coined \\"Dril's Law\\", an adage stating that \\"[f]or every single thing Donald Trump has tweeted, Dril did it earlier and better.\\" Covucci also asked: \\"What if Donald Trump is @dril? Would it be any stranger than Donald Trump being president of the United States?\\" Responding to Covucci's question, Anna North wrote in The New York Times that \\"another explanation\\" for the similarity between dril and Trump \\"seems more likely: Donald Trump's Twitter presence isn't absurdist, it's just absurd.\\" = \\"Corncob\\" = A large heap of corncobs. A misunderstanding over a reference to dril's \\"corncob\\" tweet led one journalist to quip: \\"The lesson here is clear. Always check for @dril references before you send that tweet.\\" In 2011, dril tweeted the following: The tweet describes an argument or similar situation in which one participant has clearly been \\"owned\\" but refuses to acknowledge it or to take a break, instead doubling down and insisting beyond any credibility that they have not been owned. Shortly after it was posted, Twitter users began to use screenshots of the corncob tweet to point out when a person refused to acknowledge losing an argument or suffering some other humiliation. By 2017, the word \\"corncob\\" by itself had become common slang on Twitter for this purpose. The Ringers Kate Knibbs observed that, while \\"corncob\\" as slang remained limited to communities on Twitter, the \\"corncob\\" archetype is universal and identifiable throughout contemporary culture. According to Knibbs, \\"the condition of being a corn cob‚Äîof allowing yourself to be defined by and reduced to a piercing insistence that a perceived slight has not diminished you‚Äî[has] spread far beyond a small corner of Twitter.\\" Among public figures whose recent behavior fit the \\"corncob\\" archetype, Knibbs listed Donald Trump, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, actress Louise Linton, Kim Kardashian's friend Jonathan Cheban, Kanye West (noting his numerous outbursts and 2016 song \\"Famous\\"), and Taylor Swift (noting her 2017 song \\"Look What You Made Me Do\\"). The term \\"corncob\\" became controversial after the reference was used in a meme with leftist criticisms of Kamala Harris, a Democrat and Californian Senator, and later, a 2020 presidential candidate. The political commentator Al Giordano asserted, citing a dated Urban Dictionary definition of \\"corncobbed\\", that \\"[e]very cretin who has spread this meme needs to reckon with how it uses 'corncob', a rape culture and homophobic term popular among dudebros\\", confusing the word with the slang term cornhole. Neera Tanden, the president of the Center for American Progress and an advisor on Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign, called on a Twitter user‚Äîan Ohio State student‚Äîto \\"denounce\\" the corncob meme. Various news publications reported on the story, and noted that the fast pace of Twitter discourse and unusual slang and in-jokes meant that a misunderstanding risked embarrassment and mocking. Amelia Tait, writer of an \\"internet dictionary\\" column in the New Statesman, even wrote that Giordano had \\"exposed [himself] as ignorant of online culture\\" and had, himself, been corncobbed. The term resurfaced in March 2019, when the official campaign account for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell used it to ridicule Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez by superimposing an image of a corncob onto Ocasio-Cortez's face. In turn, dril replied to McConnell's account with a link to an instructional YouTube video on how to express a dog's anal glands. = Family = dril tweets often refer to his relationships with family members‚Äîparticularly an unnamed wife/ex-wife, and numerous sons‚Äîin a manner reminiscent of father figures in American sitcoms like Married... with Children. Tom Whyman for The Outline described dril as \\"at once married and divorced (from the same essential 'wife')\\". Jia Tolentino, a staff writer for The New Yorker, credited dril as an originator of the \\"large adult son\\" trope. The trope, which Tolentino described as commonplace across social media and especially online sports journalism, involves particular observations of hapless male behavior that is \\"endlessly excusable: though [the large adult son] does nothing right, he can do no wrong.\\" The character of dril repeatedly refers to his \\"sons\\", who are usually involved in the kind of \\"classic large-adult-son behavior\\" Tolentino describes as \\"alarming, with a whiff of the surreal\\". The sons are compared to Trump's sons, particularly Donald Jr. and Eric Trump, as well as Mike Huckabee's sons. dril's regular posts about his disastrous marriage have also been compared to the wife guy stereotype that became popular in the late 2010s, of a man who gains attention on social media for posting about his wife, although dril's posts on the subject predate the emergence of this stereotype. =\\"(((Keebler Elves)))\\" controversy = In June 2016, dril drew controversy for a tweet that used triple parentheses around the name of the corporate mascots of the cookie company Keebler: Triple parentheses, or \\"echoes\\", are used online by the alt-right as an antisemitic symbol to highlight the names of Jews. Journalist Jay Hathaway wrote that most of dril's followers understood the tweet to be an ironic joke exploring the uncertain \\"etiquette around this very 2016 expression of bigotry ... Can a non-Jew apply the (((echoes))) to his own name as a show of allyship? Is it OK to use the parentheses in a joke at the white supremacists' expense? There‚Äôs no clear consensus.\\" As the \\"(((Keebler Elves)))\\" tweet spread, some far-right accounts praised dril, interpreting the tweet as a covert signal of genuine antisemitic views. Others criticized the tweet as bigoted, even if the intent was ironic, or at least in poor taste. In response to the controversy, dril alternated between dismissing those who believed he was a Nazi and making sarcastic promises to become \\"less racist\\" with the help of donations. Writer Alexander McDonough said dril's \\"refusal to clarify his views speaks to his trust in his audience to 'get' his jokes\\" and to dril's confidence in his privacy. \\"Likewise,\\" McDonough wrote, \\"[dril's] audience trusts him to make pointed satire that crosses boundaries but is never hateful. The joke is always on himself or an entrenched elite, dril never punches down.\\" According to McDonough, the controversy did not seem to have any long-term impact on dril's popularity. In the Jewish magazine Tablet, Armin Rosen called the tweet \\"an obviously satirical performance of anti-Jewish bigotry\\" and \\"the only funny anti-Semitism meta-controversy in the history of the internet.\\" Other projects In addition to his tweets, dril has many visual art side projects and collaborations with other artists. dril has made several animations, including a short film titled COW-BOY and a fictional series about the attempts of South Park co-creator Trey Parker and Green Day drummer Tr√© Cool to rename the month of April \\"Treypril/Tr√©pril\\" and \\"one policeman's mission to stop them at any cost.\\" dril has expressed interest in creating further animated films, but said he would prefer to work on projects separate from his \\"dril\\" identity. dril worked on Bear Stearns Bravo, an interactive video series that was the sequel to the Horse ebooks Twitter account. For the November 2014 issue Paper magazine, which famously featured Kim Kardashian on the cover, dril contributed an article on how to \\"break the Internet\\". dril designed the cover of the 2016 vaporwave/funk album Cyber-Vision by Drew Fairweather (\\"Drew Toothpaste\\"), best known for the webcomics Toothpaste for Dinner and Married to the Sea. dril wrote for Hiveswap, a 2017 video game based on the webcomic Homestuck. Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff and the Quest for the Missing Spoon, a book based on a story within a story in Homestuck, lists dril as a contributing author and artist alongside Homestuck creator Andrew Hussie and Gunshow author KC Green. dril was one of several artists who contributed illustrations for the card game The Devil's Level, based on the Twitter account da share z0ne. In October 2019, dril announced that he and comedian Derek Estevez-Olsen were launching a web series called Truthpoint: Darkweb Rising for Adult Swim. The show, a parody of InfoWars, streams from Adult Swim's website on Wednesdays at midnight. In the series, dril is depicted wearing a mask. =Books= In January 2017, dril opened a Patreon account for fans to make monthly payments in support of his tweets and various future projects, including \\"video, illustration, and long-form writing.\\" On the Patreon, dril described his plans for two book projects: an elaborate art book \\"with a narrative adjacent to the 'Mythos' surrounding my posts\\" and a \\"best of\\"-style compilation of tweets as a coffee table book with bonus content. By October 2017, dril's Patreon received $2,200 a month from fans. dril published his first book, Dril Official \\"Mr. Ten Years\\" Anniversary Collection, in August 2018. The book compiles the account's best tweets from its first ten years, as selected by the author, along with new original illustrations. A second book, The Get Rich and Become God Method, was published in 2020.  Reception and following  Over time, dril has grown from a relatively obscure Twitter account with a small cult following to a widely followed, well-known account on the site. In October 2012, dril had only 23,000 followers. By December 2014, that number had grown to 166,000, and then 567,000 by May 2017. On January 10, 2018, dril hit one million followers. Unlike most comedians with large Twitter followings, dril became popular without a public reputation or career outside of the platform. Following dril has often been described‚Äîsometimes in a half-serious or tongue-in-cheek manner, other times sincerely‚Äîas one of the few good uses of Twitter. In November 2017, shortly after the doxing incident, dril was called \\"arguably the most iconic Twitter account in the history of social media [and] practically internet royalty\\" in The A.V. Club and \\"one of the internet's most unlikely treasures\\" in Slate. dril's writing has been praised by a variety of public figures, including poet Patricia Lockwood; comedian and actor Rob Delaney; writer and The New Yorker staff writer Adrian Chen; and Reply All hosts PJ Vogt and Alex Goldman. In 2019, British writer Tom Whyman argued (in earnest) that dril should be considered for the Nobel Prize in Literature as \\"the one true poet of the internet age\\"; in Whyman's view, recognizing dril's writing as literature would be equivalent to historical shifts in the definition of \\"art\\" prompted by avant-garde works by artists like Marcel Duchamp and Andy Warhol. = Acclaim for the account generally = @dril is frequently listed among the funniest or best Twitter accounts. In 2012, The Daily Dot cited dril as one of the funniest accounts on Twitter and noted that reading dril's \\"[d]arkly funny ... odd, provocative, and clever\\" tweets \\"simultaneously brings a sense of head-scratching wonder and slightly uncomfortable chortles.\\" Max Read, then an editor of Gawker, named dril one of the publication's \\"heroes\\" of 2013 in a year-in-review piece. According to Read, dril's writing stood out in a paranoid web landscape overrun by spambots and covert corporate marketing: Paste included dril on its lists of best Twitter accounts every year between 2013 and 2016, and the comedy site Splitsider (later merged into Vulture) named dril one of the funniest accounts of 2017. For a March 2019 feature commemorating the 30th anniversary of Tim Berners-Lee's invention of the World Wide Web, The Verge listed @dril among the greatest websites, people, and technologies in web history. Later that year, The A.V. Club ranked dril sixth on its list of the \\"best, worst, and weirdest things\\" on the Internet in the 2010s. = Acclaim for individual tweets = Individual dril tweets have also been lauded by the press. At the occasion of Twitter's tenth anniversary, both GQ and Newsweek named this dril tweet among the best or funniest tweets of all time: The same tweet had also been listed among the site's funniest by BuzzFeed in 2014. The \\"corncob\\" tweet was listed as the 8th most \\"canonical\\" tweet of all time in 2017 by Mic, whose Miles Klee wrote it was \\"categorically impossible\\" to select the single best dril tweet. Another dril tweet‚Äî\\"IF THE ZOO BANS ME FOR HOLLERING AT THE ANIMALS I WILL FACE GOD AND WALK BACKWARDS INTO HELL\\"‚Äîwas ranked among the site's \\"greatest\\" by Thought Catalog in 2013. Slate counted one of his tweets among the best sentences written in 2017, ranking dril alongside such writers as Umberto Eco, Ta-Nehisi Coates, Anne Carson, Mohsin Hamid, Jennifer Egan, Durga Chew-Bose, John Darnielle, and Daniel Dennett.

It is believed Flavianus was suffect consul in one of the nundinia that fell in the last half of 117, based on a restoration of a military diploma dated 18 August;Werner Eck, \\"Konsuln des Jahres 117 in Milit√§rdiplomen Traians mit Tribunicia Potestas XX\\", Zeitschrift f√ºr Papyrologie und Epigraphik, 185 (2013), pp. 235‚Äì238 if this restoration is correct, then he was the colleague of Lucius Cossonius Gallus. Flavianus is known only through surviving inscriptions. Flavianus was governor of the imperial province of Pannonia Inferior from 111 to 115; it is possible that he was the direct successor of Titus Julius Maximus Manlianus, believed to have been governor from the year 107 until 111.Eck, \\"Jahres- und Provinzialfasten der senatorischen Statthalter von 69/70 bis 138/139\\", Chiron, 12 (1982), pp. 351-358 Since Flavianus governed an imperial province, one can reasonably expect that Flavianus was also a legatus or commander of a legion prior to 111, since both offices were usually required for senators in the emperor's service to reach the consulate -- although there are exceptions to this practice. Nevertheless, evidence is lacking whether he had commanded one or not. An inscription erected in Ephesus by the contemporary Asiarch attests that Flavianus was proconsular governor of Asia, the pinnacle of a successful senatorial career, for the term 130/131.Eck, \\"Jahres- und Provinzialfasten der senatorischen Statthalter von 69/70 bis 138/139\\", Chiron, 13 (1983), pp. 169, 171 n. 413 There is no record of him after his governorship.

It borders Abba, Awkuzu and Ukpo in the North, Abagana in the South Umunachi on the East and Umudioka and Umunya on West. History Ifitedunu is the second son of Dunu, whom was famously called Okofia. Dunukofia as he is called has five children and they are as thus; Ukpo, Ifite, Umunnachi, Umudioka, Ukwulu. As the second son of a great man he grew in strength and knowledge. Ifite has a closer relationship with his senor brother Ukpo, that was why he was formerly called Ifite Ukpo. Most people misunderstood Ukpo and Ifite-Ukpo, with the thought that Ifite-Ukpo is a town in Ukpo. In as much as its not true, but that claim affected the development of Ifite as a town. So, on December 28 1991, the town Union and her people decided to rename the town to Ifitedunu, under the Leadership of Jasper Elias Nwakeze Azodo (President General) and HRH. Igwe Augustine Ezechi Okoye Eze Dunu 1 History Ifitedunu, then Ifite-Upko was peaceful and calm. Just like every other Igbo community, they were governed by elders and chief priest till the advent of the Colonial Masters. The Colonial Masters, introduced the Warrant Chief. These warrant chiefs assisted the colonial authorities to collect taxes and other levies from the community. Chief Amadu Obinnabo was the warrant chief of Ifitedunu then Ifite-Upko. He, as it was then, was answerable to Chief M. A. Eze, the Warrant chief of Ukpo, whom all the chiefs from Ifite, Umunachi, Umudioka and Ukwulu, where answerable to. After the civil war the town agreed that power will change from the chief priest to what is today known as \\"President General\\" of the town union, and in 1970 A. N. Uzowulu was elected the first President General of Ifitedunu. Z. O. Dibiaezue took over in the year 1971, After his death in 1975. B. Dibiaezue took over from his late brother in that same year. However, he made long awaited quest of having a king a reality, and so in the year 1976, Augustine Ezechi Okoye Dunu 1 was crowned the first king of Ifitedunu. This was one of the success of Dibiaezue as President General of town. He however, handed over to Elias Odili in the year 1981, who stayed in office for 10 years before handing over to Evang. Jasper Elias Nwakeze Azodo in the year 1991, he handed over to Emmanuel Omanukwue in the year 1993. Evang. Jasper Elias Nwakeze Azodo later played a vital role in rearranging the town union presidency and laying down a constitution. After that he and his team handed the new government over to Ignatius Okafor in the year 2000, after completing his tenure as the new constitution had it, he handed over power to Afam Maduegbuna in the year 2003. Mr Afam handed over to Uche Udedibia in the year 2006, he handed over to Anthony Udedibia in the year 2009, after him came Nezianya Obinabo in the year 2012. In 2015 Chief Samuel Nweke was handed power as the President-General of Ifitedunu Town Union. His reign as the town union president, brought development that was seen by all, like the completion of the Ifitedunu civic center, Ifitedunu plaza and so on. He handed over power to Chief Sir Uchenna Nwoye Oragwuncha Isimmili Ifitedunu on 30 December 2019. He is the current President General as the time of this report.

Bioconservatism is characterized by a belief that technological trends in today's society risk compromising human dignity, and by opposition to movements and technologies including transhumanism, human genetic modification, \\"strong\\" artificial intelligence, and the technological singularity. Many bioconservatives also oppose the use of technologies such as life extension and preimplantation genetic screening. Bioconservatives range in political perspective from right- leaning religious and cultural conservatives to left-leaning environmentalists and technology critics. What unifies bioconservatives is skepticism about medical and other biotechnological transformations of the living world.Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011).

Tarcher/Putnam, New York, New York.Shiva, Vandana (2000). ‚Äò‚ÄôStolen Harvest: The Hijacking of the Global Food Supply,‚Äô‚Äô South End Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts. Typically less sweeping as a critique of technological society than bioluddism, the bioconservative perspective is characterized by its defense of the natural, deployed as a moral category. Philosophical arguments for bioconservatism Bioconservatives seek to counter the arguments made by transhumanists who support the use of human enhancement technologies despite acknowledging the risks these involve. Transhumanists believe that these technologies have the power to radically change what we currently perceive of as a human being, and that they are necessary for future human development. An example of this can be seen in the arguments of Nick Bostrom , who believes that genetic modification will be essential to improving human health in the future. The three major elements of the bioconservative argument, as described by Bostrom, are firstly, that human augmentation is innately degrading and therefore harmful, secondly, that the existence of augmented humans poses a threat to \\"ordinary humans\\", and thirdly, that human augmentation shows a lack of acknowledgement that \\"not everything in the world is open to any use we may desire or devise\\". The first two of these elements are secular whilst the last derives \\"from religious or crypto-religious sentiments\\". =Michael Sandel's arguments= Michael Sandel Michael J. Sandel is an American political philosopher and a prominent bioconservative. His article and subsequent book, both titled \\"The Case Against Perfection\\", concern the moral permissibility of genetic engineering or genome editing. Sandel compares genetic and non-genetic forms of enhancement pointing to the fact that much of non-genetic alteration has largely the same effect as genetic engineering. SAT tutors or study drugs such as Ritalin can have similar effects as minor tampering with natural born intelligence. Sandel uses such examples to argue that the most important moral issue with genetic engineering is not that the consequences of manipulating human nature will undermine human agency but the perfectionist aspiration behind such a drive to mastery. For Sandel, \\"the deepest moral objection to enhancement lies less in the perfection it seeks than in the human disposition it expresses and promotes‚Äù. For example, the parental desire for a child to be of a certain genetic quality is incompatible with the special kind of unconditional love parents should have for their children. He writes ‚Äú[t]o appreciate children as gifts is to accept them as they come, not as objects of our design or products of our will or instruments of our ambition‚Äù. Sandel insists that consequentialist arguments overlook the principle issue of whether bioenhancement should be aspired to at all. He is attributed with the view that human augmentation should be avoided as it expresses an excessive desire to change oneself and 'become masters of our nature'. For example, in the field of cognitive enhancement, he argues that moral question we should be concerned with is not the consequences of inequality of access to such technology in possibly creating two classes of humans but whether we should aspire to such enhancement at all. Similarly, he has argued that the ethical problem with genetic engineering is not that it undermines the child's autonomy, as this claim \\"wrongly implies that absent a designing parent, children are free to choose their characteristics for themselves\\". Rather, he sees enhancement as hubristic, taking nature into our own hands: pursuing the fixity of enhancement is an instance of vanity. Sandel also criticises the argument that a genetically engineered athlete would have an unfair advantage over his unenhanced competitors, suggesting that it has always been the case that some athletes are better endowed genetically than others. In short, Sandel argues that the real ethical problems with genetic engineering concern its effects on humility, responsibility and solidarity.  Humility  Sandel argues that humility is a moral virtue that will be undermined by genetic engineering. He argues that humility encourages one to 'abide the unexpected, to live with dissonance, to rein in the impulse control', and therefore, is worth fostering in all aspects of one's life. This includes the humility of parents regarding their own genetic endowment and that of their children. Sandel's concern is that, through genetic engineering, the relationship between parent and child is \\"disfigured\\": > The problem lies in the hubris of the designing parents, in their drive to > master the mystery of genetics. Even if this disposition did not make > parents tyrants to their children, it would disfigure the relation between > parent and child, thus depriving the parent of the humility and enlarged > human sympathies that an openness to the unbidden can cultivate. Essentially, Sandel believes that in order to be a good parent with the virtue of humility, one needs to accept that their child may not progress exactly according to their expectations. Designing an athletic child, for example, is incompatible with the idea of parents having such open expectations. He argues that genetic enhancement deprives the parent of the humility of an 'openness to the unbidden' fosters. Sandel believes that parents must be prepared to love their child unconditionally and to see their children as gifts from nature, rather than entities to be defined according to parental and genetic expectations. Moreover, in the paper The Case Against Perfection, Sandel argues: > I do not think the main problem with enhancement and genetic engineering is > that they undermine effort and erode human agency. The deeper danger is that > they represent a kind of hyperagency‚Äîa Promethean aspiration to remake > nature, including human nature, to serve our purposes and satisfy our > desires\\". In doing so, Sandel worries that an essential aspect of human nature - and the meaning of life derived from such, would be eroded in the process of expanding radically beyond our naturally endowed capacities. He calls this yearning the \\"Promethean project\\", which is necessarily constrained by appreciating our humility and place in nature. Sandel adds: > It is in part a religious sensibility. But its resonance reaches beyond > religion. Responsibility Sandel argues that due to the increasing role of genetic enhancement, there will be an 'explosion' of responsibility on humanity. He argues that genetic engineering will increase parental responsibility as \\"parents become responsible for choosing, or failing to choose, the right traits for their children\\". He believes that such responsibility will lead to genes become a matter of choice rather than a matter of chance. Sandel illustrates this argument through the lens of sports: in athletics, undesirable outcomes are often attributed to extrinsic values such as lack of preparation or lapse in discipline. With the introduction of genetic engineering athletes, Sandel believes that athletes will bear additional responsibility for their talents and performance; for example, for failing to acquire the intrinsic traits necessary for success. Sandel believes this can be extrapolated to society as a whole: individuals will be forced to shoulder more responsibility for deficiencies in the face of increased genetic choice. Solidarity Sandel points out that without genetic engineering, a child is \\"at the mercy of the genetic lottery\\". Insurance markets allow a pooling of risk for the benefit of all: those who turn out to be healthy subsidise those who are not. This could be phrased more generally as: individual success is not fully determined by that individual or their parents, as genetic traits are to some extent randomly assigned from a collective pool. Sandel argues that, because we all face the same risks, social insurance schemes that rely on a sense of solidarity are possible. However, genetic enhancement gives individuals perfect genetic knowledge and increased resistance to some diseases. Enhanced individuals would not opt into such a system or such human community, because it would involve guaranteed losses for them. They would feel no debt to their community, and social solidarity would disappear. Sandel argues that solidarity 'arises when men and women reflect on the contingency of their talents and fortunes'. He argues that if our genetic endowments begin to be seen as 'achievements for which we can claim credit', society would have no obligation to share with those less fortunate. Consequently, Sandel mounts a case against the perfection of genetic knowledge because it would end the solidarity arising when people reflect on the non-necessary nature of their fortunes. =Leon Kass' arguments= Leon Kass In his paper ‚ÄúAgeless Bodies, Happy Souls\\", Leon Kass argues for bioconservatism. His argument was first delivered as a lecture at the Washington D.C. Ethics and Public Policy Center and later published as an article in The Atlantic. Although it was written during the time when Kass chaired the President's Council on Bioethics, the views expressed are his own, and not those of the Council. In brief, he argues that for three main reasons there is something wrong with biotechnological enhancement. Kass calls them the arguments of \\"the attitude of mastery\\", \\"'unnatural' means\\" and \\"dubious ends\\". Before he turns to these arguments, he focuses on the distinction between \\"therapy\\" and \\"enhancement\\". While therapy has the aim of (re-)establishing the state of what could be considered as \\"normal\\" (e.g. abortion, replacement of organs), enhancement gives people an advantage over the \\"normal workings\\" of the human body (e.g. immortality). On the basis of this distinction, Kass argues, most people would support therapy, but remain sceptical towards enhancement. However, he believes this distinction is not clear, since it is hard to tell where therapy stops and enhancement begins. One reason he gives is that the \\"normal workings\\" of the human body cannot be unambiguously defined due to the variance within humans: someone may be born with perfect pitch, another deaf. Bostrom and Roache reply to this by giving an instance where one may clearly speak of permissible enhancement. They claim that extending a life (i.e. making it longer than it would normally have been) means that one saves this particular life. Since one would believe it is morally permissible to save lives (as long as no harm is caused), they claim that there is no good reason to believe extending a life is impermissible. The relevance of the above counterargument presented by Bostrom and Roache becomes clearer when we consider the essence of Kass's skepticism with 'enhancement'. Firstly, he labels natural human experiences like ageing, death and unhappiness as preconditions of human flourishing. By extension, given that technological enhancement diminishes these preconditions and therefore hinders human flourishing, he is able to assert that enhancement is not morally permissible. That being said, Bostrom and Roache challenge Kass's inherent assumption that extending life is different from saving it. In other words, they argue that by alleviating ageing and death, someone's life is being extended, which is no different from saving their life. By this argument, the concept of human flourishing becomes entirely irrelevant since it is morally permissible to save someone's life, regardless of whether they are leading a flourishing life or not. The problematic attitude of biotechnological enhancement One of Leon Kass' main arguments on this matter concerns the attitude of 'mastery'. Kass implies that although the means are present to modify human nature (both body and mind), the ends remain unknown, filled with unintended consequences: Due to the unawareness of the goodness of potential ends, Kass claims this not to be mastery at all. Instead, we are acting on the momentary whims that nature exposes us to, effectively making it impossible for humanity to escape from the \\"grip of our own nature\\". Kass builds on Sandel's argument that transhumanists fail to properly recognise the 'giftedness' of the world. He agrees that this idea is useful in that it should teach us an attitude of modesty, restraint and humility. However, he believes it will not by itself sufficiently indicate which things can be manipulated and which should be left untouched. Therefore, Kass additionally proposes that we must also respect the 'givenness' of species-specified natures - 'given' in the sense of something fixed and specified. 'Unnatural' means of biotechnological enhancement Kass refers to biotechnological enhancement as cheating or ‚Äòcheap‚Äô, because it undermines the feeling of having worked hard to achieve a certain aim. He writes, ‚ÄúThe naturalness of means matters. It lies not in the fact that the assisting drugs and devices are artifacts, but in the danger of violating or deforming the deep structure of the natural human activity.‚Äù By nature, there is ‚Äúan experiential and intelligible connection between means and ends.‚Äù Kass suggests that the struggles one has to go through to achieve excellence \\"is not only the source of our deeds, but also their product.\\" Therefore, they build character. He maintains that biotechnology as a shortcut does not build character but instead erodes self-control. This can be seen in how confronting fearful things might eventually enable us to cope with our fears, unlike a pill which merely prevents people from experiencing fear and thereby doesn't help us overcome it. As Kass notes, \\"people who take pills to block out from memory the painful or hateful aspects of new experience will not learn how to deal with suffering or sorrow. A drug to induce fearlessness does not produce courage.\\" He contends that there is a necessity in having limited biotechnological enhancement for humans as it recognises giftedness and forges humility. Kass notes that while there are biological interventions that may assist in the pursuit of excellence without cheapening its attainment, \\"partly because many of life's excellences have nothing to do with competition or adversity,\\" (e.g. \\"drugs to decrease drowsiness or increase alertness... may actually help people in their natural pursuits of learning or painting or performing their civic duty,\\") \\"the point is less the exertions of good character against hardship, but the manifestation of an alert and self- experiencing agent making his deeds flow intentionally from his willing, knowing, and embodied soul.\\" Kass argues that we need to have an \\"intelligible connection\\" between means and ends in order to call one's bodies, minds, and transformations genuinely their own. 'Dubious' ends of biotechnological enhancement The case for ageless bodies is that the prevention of decay, decline, and disability, the avoidance of blindness, deafness, and debility, the elimination of feebleness, frailty, and fatigue, are conducive to living fully as a human being at the top of one's powers, and a \\"good quality of life\\" from beginning to end. However, Kass argues that human limitation is what gives the opportunity for happiness. Firstly, he argues that \\"a concern with one's own improving agelessness is finally incompatible with accepting the need for procreation and human renewal.\\" This creates a world \\"hostile to children,\\" and arguably \\"increasingly dominated by anxiety over health and the fear of death.\\" This is because the existence of decline and decay is precisely what allows us to accept mortality. The hostility towards children is resultant of the redundancy of new generations to the progression of the human species, given infinite lifespan; progression and evolution of the human race would no longer arise from procreation and succession, but from the engineered enhancement of existing generations. Secondly, He explains that one needs to grieve in order to love, and that one must feel lack to be capable of aspiration: > [...] human fulfillment depends on our being creatures of need and finitude > and hence of longings and attachment. Finally, Kass warns, \\"the engaged and energetic being-at-work of what uniquely gave to us is what we need to treasure and defend. All other perfection is at best a passing illusion, at worst a Faustian bargain that will cost us our full and flourishing humanity.\\" Jurgen Habermas = J√ºrgen Habermas's arguments = J√ºrgen Habermas has also written against genetic human enhancement. In his book ‚ÄúThe Future of Human Nature‚Äù, Habermas rejects the use of prenatal genetic technologies to enhance offspring. Habermas rejects genetic human enhancement on two main grounds: the violation of ethical freedom, and the production of asymmetrical relationships. He broadens this discussion by then discussing the tensions between the evolution of science with religion and moral principles. Violation of ethical freedom Habermas points out that a genetic modification produces an external imposition on a person's life that is qualitatively different from any social influence. This prenatal genetic modification will most likely be chosen by one's parents, therefore threatening the ethical freedom and equality that one is entitled to as a birthright. For Habermas, the difference relies in that while socialisation processes can always be contested, genetic designs cannot therefore possess a level of unpredictability. This argument builds on Habermas' magnum opus discourse ethics. For Habermas: > Eugenic interventions aiming at enhancement reduce ethical freedom insofar > as they tie down the person concerned to rejected, but irreversible > intentions of third parties, barring him from the spontaneous self- > perception of being the undivided author of his own life. Asymmetrical relationships Habermas suggested that genetic human enhancements would create asymmetric relationships that endanger democracy, which is premised on the idea of moral equality. He claims that regardless of the scope of the modifications, the very knowledge of enhancement obstructs symmetrical relationships between parents and their children. The child's genome was interfered with nonconsensually, making predecessors responsible for the traits in question. Unlike for thinkers like Fukuyama, Habermas' point is not that these traits might produce different ‚Äòtypes of humans‚Äô. Rather, he placed the emphasis on how others are responsible in choosing these traits. This is the fundamental difference between natural traits and human enhancement, and it is what bears decisive weight for Habermas: the child's autonomy as self-determination is violated. However, Habermas does acknowledge that, for example, making one's son very tall in the hope that they will become a basketball player does not automatically determine that he will choose this path. However, although the opportunity can be turned down, this does not make it any less of a violation from being forced into an irreversible situation. Genetic modification has two large-scale consequences. Firstly, no action the child undertakes can be ascribed to her own negotiation with the natural lottery, since a ‚Äòthird party‚Äô has negotiated on the child's behalf. This imperils the sense of responsibility for one's own life that comes along with freedom. As such, individuals‚Äô self-understanding as ethical beings is endangered, opening the door to ethical nihilism. This is so because the genetic modification creates a type of dependence in which one of the parts does not even have the hypothetical possibility of changing social places with the other. Secondly, it becomes impossible to collectively and democratically establish moral rules through communication, since a condition for their establishment is the possibility to question assertions. Genetically modified individuals, however, never realise if their very questioning might have been informed by enhancement, nor can they question it. That being said, Habermas acknowledges that our societies are full of asymmetric relationships, such as oppression of minorities or exploitation. However, these conditions could be different. On the contrary, genetic modification cannot be reverted once it is performed. Criticism The transhumanist Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies criticizes bioconservatism as a form of \\"human racism\\" (more commonly known as speciesism), and as being motivated by a \\"yuck factor\\" that ignores individual freedoms. = Nick Bostrom on posthuman dignity = Nick Bostrom, transhumanist and critic against Bioconservatism Nick Bostrom argues that bioconservative concerns as to how transhumanism might threaten posthuman dignity are unsubstantiated. Bostrom himself identifies with forms of posthuman dignity, and in his article In Defence of Posthuman Dignity, argues that such does not run in contradiction with the ideals of transhumanism. Bostrom argues in the article that Fukuyama's concerns about the threats transhumanism pose to dignity as moral status - that transhumanism might strip away humanity's inalienable right of respect- lacks empirical evidence. He states that the proportion of people given full moral respect in Western societies has actually increased through history. This increase includes such populations as non-whites, women and non-property owners. Following this logic, it will similarly be feasible to incorporate future posthumans without compensating the dignities of the rest of the population. Bostrom then goes on to discuss dignity in the sense of moral worthiness, which varies among individuals. He suggests that posthumans can similarly possess dignity in this sense. Further, he suggests, it is possible that posthumans, being genetically enhanced, may come to possess even higher levels of moral excellence than contemporary human beings. While he considers that certain posthumans may live more degraded lives as a result of self- enhancement, he also notes that even at this time many people are not living worthy lives either. He finds this regrettable and suggests that countermeasures as education and cultural reforms can be helpful in curtailing such practices. Bostrom supports the morphological and reproductive freedoms of human beings, suggesting that ultimately, leading whatever life one aspires should be an unalienable right. Reproductive freedom means that parents should be free to choose the technological enhancements they want when having a child. According to Bostrom, there is no reason to prefer the random processes of nature over human design (instantiated by the parents). He dismisses claims that see this kind of operations as 'tyranny' of the parents over the children-to-be. In his opinion, the tyranny of nature is no different. In fact, he claims that \\"Had Mother Nature been a real parent, she would have been in jail for child abuse and murder\\" Earlier in the paper, Bostrom also replies to Leon Kass with the claim that, in his words, 'nature's gifts are sometimes poisoned and should not always be accepted'. He makes the point that nature cannot be relied upon for normative standards. Instead, he suggests that transhumanism can, over time, allow for the technical improvement of 'human nature', consistent with our widely held societal morals. According to Bostrom, the way that bioconservatives justify banning certain human enhancements while not others, reveal the double standard that is present in this line of thought. For him, a misleading conception of human dignity is to blame for this. We mistakenly take for granted that human nature is an intrinsic, unmodifiable set of properties. This problem, he argues, is overcome when human nature is conceived as 'dynamic, partially human-made, and improvable'. If we acknowledge that social and technological factors influence our nature, then dignity 'consists in what we are and what we have the potential to become, not in our pedigree or social origin'. It can be seen, then, than improved capabilities does not affect moral status, and that we should sustain an inclusive view that recognize our enhanced descendants as possessors of dignity. For transhumanists 'there is no need to behave as if there were deep moral difference between technological and other means of enhancing human lives'. Distinguishing between types of enhancement Bostrom discusses a criticism levelled against transhumanists by bioconservatives, that children who are biologically enhanced by certain kinds of technologies will face psychological anguish because of the enhancement. # Prenatal enhancements may create expectations for the individual's future traits or behaviour. # If the individual learns of these enhancements, this is likely to cause them psychological anguish stemming from pressure to fulfil such expectations. # Actions which are likely to cause individuals psychological anguish are undesirable to the point of being morally reprehensible. # Therefore, prenatal enhancements are morally reprehensible. Bostrom finds that bioconservatives rely on a false dichotomy between technological enhancements that are harmful and those that are not, thus challenging premise two. Bostrom argues that children whose mothers played Mozart to them in the womb would not face psychological anguish upon discovering that their musical talents had been ‚Äúprenatally programmed by her parents‚Äù. However, he finds that bioconservative writers often employ analogous arguments to the contrary demonstrating that technological enhancements, rather than playing mozart in the womb, could potentially disturb children.  Hans Jonas on reproductive freedom  Hans Jonas contends the criticisms about bio-enhanced children by questioning their freedom without the presence of enhancement. He argues that enhancement would increase their freedom. This is because enhanced physical and mental capabilities would allow for greater opportunities; the children would no longer be constrained by physical or mental deficiencies. Jonas further weakens the arguments about reproductive freedom by referencing Habermas. Habermas argues that freedom for offspring is restricted by the knowledge of their enhancement. To challenge this, Jonas elaborates on his notion about reproductive freedom.

History Fitzgerald obtained a commission as a Spanish privateer (guarda costa) out of Havana in 1672. Late that year he captured the English ship Humility under Matthew Fox, abusing the captured crew until several of them died. Fox testified that when Fitzgerald was asked why he was so barbaric to English captives, he exclaimed: ‚Äúgiving no reason but that his countrymen were ill-used by the English 24 years ago, and he should never be satisfied with English blood, but could drink it as freely as water when he was adry; and he had commission to sink or take all ships trading from Jamaica, and kill those.‚Äù Early in 1673 he captured the 130-ton logwood hauler Virgin of Edmund Cooke, putting him and his crew in a longboat with no provisions. Cooke survived, and incensed at losing a second ship to the Spanish some time later, finally turned to piracy against the Spanish. Fitzgerald captured more English ships near Campeche in late 1673 alongside Jelles de Lecat (‚ÄúYellows‚Äù) and Jan Erasmus Reyning, the three of them accounting for more than 40 captures. Finally in early 1674 both English officials and King Charles II issued proclamations offering pardons to Lecat and Fitzgerald if they surrendered and abandoned the Spanish, but calling for their death or capture if they refused: ‚Äúand in regard Captains Yellows and Fitzgerald, two of his Majesty's subjects, appeared to be the chief instruments of said depredations, That a Proclamation be issued for recalling his Majesty's subjects from the service of any foreign Prince between the tropics in America, with promise of pardon if they render themselves within a convenient time; and that the Governor of Jamaica receive speedy order for securing both said persons if found so offending after the time limited within his Government, and cause them to be sent prisoners to England.‚Äù Fitzgerald sailed his 12-gun man-of-war into Havana with yet another captured English prize ship in summer 1674, this time with English prisoners hung from the yardarms. After depositions regarding more of Fitzgerald's crimes came to light, and after Spain refused to compensate some of his English victims, in September 1675 the order was given to hunt him down: \\"Ordered, that Mr. Attorney-General hasten the Proclamation for bringing in the head of Fitzgerald the Pirate from the Havana.\\" Fitzgerald‚Äôs ultimate fate is unknown. In 1687 navigator and explorer William Dampier was in the Luconia Shoals, part of a crew which had mutinied and abandoned buccaneer Charles Swan at Mindanao in the Philippines. He encountered several pirates who had also been part of Swan's crew; they reported meeting \\"an Irishman who went by the name of John Fitz-Gerald, a person that spoke Spanish very well.\\" This Fitzgerald \\"had in this time gotten a Spanish Mestiza woman to wife, and a good dowry with her\\" and \\"being an Irish Roman Catholic, and having the Spanish language, he had a great advantage of all his consorts; and he alone lived well there of them all.\\" Whether this was a later adventure of Philip Fitzgerald is not certain.

The dam is located in Tashanyan Village, Yinjiang Town, Haishu District, Ningbo, Zhejiang, China. Originally designed under the supervision of Wang Yuanwei, who was the administrator of Yin County, in an attempt to prevent tidal sea water from accessing the banks of the Fenghua River and to store water during periods of severe drought. The dam later became part of a large-scale irrigation system serving Ningbo City. This infrastructure is particularly notable because it is recognized as a historical site protected by the state. History Prior to the dam's construction, the surrounding area regularly experienced devastating floods due to the torrential rains that would come every summer and autumn due to the local sub-tropical climate. Once it combined with the flat terrain and the high salt content of the Fenghua River, it decimated the crops and made the inhabitants suffer bouts of famine. To remedy this situation, the construction of Tashan Weir was decided by Wang Yuanwei, a magistrate originally from Shandong, and was completed in 833 with the aim of decreasing the risk of flooding and permanently removing salted water from arable land. The dam was also used to divert water to two different directions. The first stream flows along the Nantang River, serves Dongqiao, Hengzhang, Beidu, Lishe, Shiqi and Duantang, then reaches the city of Ningbo intra-muros before pouring into the man-made () and Sun Lake () which no longer exists today. The second flow goes up north, serving Xiaoxi, Meiyuan and Shenjiao. Ancient network of the different Ningbo water courses, with Sun and Moon lakes highlighted In total, the hydraulic system of Tashan Weir (the dam, the two flows, and the ancillary facilities) has been irrigating nearly 16,000 hectares of land for centuries, and continues to do so even today. The Ningbo area experienced rapid growth due to the stability of water supply that the dam provided. Construction The dam is about 110 meters long and its top is approximately 5 meters wide. Its outer part is composed of roughly regular stones (2 to 3 meters long and 0.2 to 0.35 meters thick) while its internal part is made of a mixture of stone and wood. In order to consolidate the structure, molten iron was directly injected in some places. The dam was designed in such a way that it adjusts perfectly with the course of the river and is able to withstand risks associated with erosion over time. Maintenance and restructuring work were continuously carried out, from the imperial dynasties to nowadays. The design of the facility ensured that, in cases of excessive rain, 70 percent of the flood water flows to the Zhang River (inner river) while the remaining 30 percent discharges to the Nantang River (outer river).Angelakis et al., p. 198. This proportion in the flow of water is reversed during periods of drought. The Tashan Weir was able to achieve this through the installation of water gates between the inner and outer rivers. Legacy Stela commemorating the accession of Tashan Weir as a Major Historical and Cultural Site Protected at the National Level Tashan Weir was officially declared on 13 January 1988 as a Major Historical and Cultural Site Protected at the National Level (Number 3-55). It is also recognized as one of the four most important water conservation projects of imperial or pre-imperial China, with the Zhengguo Canal, the Lingqu Canal, as well as Dujiangyan. A temple with a statue representing Wang Yuanwei and ten builders of Tashan Weir was built nearby and important ceremonies and cultural festivities are regularly held there.

He won the National Physique Committee (NPC) Mr. Teen California title in 1989, NPC Mr. California in 1998 and National Physique Committee (NPC) competitions in 2003 and 2009. He had his own nutrition product line called Rich Piana: 5% Nutrition. He publicly admitted that he had been using anabolic steroids (including Trenbolone), synthetic human growth hormone and insulin as part of his bodybuilding regimen during his career, starting when he was 18 years old. He had said he was aware that the steroids would do damage to his body, but had also said steroid use was a necessary part of competing at the highest levels of bodybuilding and that it was a risk he was willing to take. He died at the age of 46, after two weeks in a coma. At death, his heart and liver weighed over twice the average amount for an adult male, and he had \\"serious heart disease\\". He had been aware that his organs were enlarged and that is a known side effect of the steroids, human growth hormone, insulin and other hormones he had been taking. There was also significant hardening of the arteries and plaque in his arteries (coronary atherosclerosis). He also had abnormally yellowish skin color, fatty liver, ascites (accumulation of protein-containing fluid in the abdomen), congested thyroid, congested and discolored kidneys, ischemic brain tissue (brain tissue that had lost blood supply), necrotic brain tissue and brain edema. Another abnormality was in his lungs, which were filled with yellow fluid and swollen (bronchopneumonia pleural effusion wih edema), had apparent fat emboli and micro-abscesses, and also displayed both acute and chronic inflammatory cells. However, the autopsy report was ultimately inconclusive on the cause and manner of his death, due to the hospital disposing of any specimens prior to his death. Piana was popular among the weightlifting community as a result of both his bodybuilding achievements and his gregarious and over-the-top extroverted personality. He was known for running a vlog on YouTube which featured motivational speaking, personal life stories, exercise montages, special guest appearances, and insights into Piana's daily life. In his videos he often spoke of the 5%, which he described as a mentality and movement of people willing to do whatever it takes to achieve their goals. Early life Piana was born in Glendale, California, on September 26, 1970. His ancestry was Armenian (through his mother) and Italian (through his father). Raised in Sacramento, California, his enthrallment with bodybuilding began when he was six. He would go to the gym to watch his mother train for her bodybuilding contests. Alongside her, Piana was also heavily influenced by Bill Cambra, an \\"old-school\\" bodybuilder. At age 11, Piana began weightlifting. Four years later, he started competing in bodybuilding contests. For his senior year in high school, he lived with his father in La Crescenta, California. By the age of 18, Piana already had several titles, including NPC Mr. Teen California in 1989, and had started on a common steroid cycle practice known as \\"test and deca\\" that combines testosterone (an anabolic steroid that is the primary male sex hormone) and Deca-Durabolin (known generically as Nandrolone). Career Piana won the NPC Mr. Teen California competition in 1989 at age 18, and in 1998 he was named NPC Mr. California. He continued to compete on and off for about 25 years, winning NPC competitions in the 2003 Los Angeles Super-Heavyweight division, 2009 Sacramento Super-Heavyweight division, and the 2009 Border States Classic Super-Heavyweight division and overall championship. He was featured on the cover of the November 1998 issue of Ironman magazine and the Summer 2015 issue of Muscle Sport magazine. He had a cameo appearance as The Incredible Hulk in an episode of the television series Scrubs, and played an oiled-up muscle man named Marcus in an episode of \\"Malcolm in the Middle\\" (without any spoken lines). He was one of the main focuses of the 2017 bodybuilding documentary Generation Iron 2. In a 2014 YouTube video, he said that he had used anabolic steroids over the course of 25 years ‚Äì since he was 18 years old ‚Äì and specifically stated that everyone should be aware that using steroids will do damage to their body, but also said that he was willing to take the chance. He said he had experienced some side effects, such as hair loss, gynecomastia (enlarged breasts, which he had treated with medication), and signs of liver toxicity, but said he had not had acne or major problems thus far. However, he said: \\"I am totally 100% aware that damage is being done to my body by the choices I am making\\", that \\"I know for a fact that doing what I am doing is going to cause damage\\", but also said: \\"I have made a choice and I am willing to deal with that ‚Äì I am willing to take those chances\\". In another video in 2016, he backed up his decision but advised viewers not to use the drugs, stating, \\"If you have the choice to do steroids or stay natural, stay natural. There's no reason to do steroids. You're only hurting your body and hurting yourself.\\" He then said that professional bodybuilders have no such choice, since they cannot win at that level without using the drugs. He said, \\"I was competing on stage and I was getting to the point where I was going to keep getting blown off the stage if I didn't do them. So I took that step and that's the road I chose, and here I am.\\" He offered advice on how to use the drugs \\"properly\\" for those he said were going to use them anyway. He said that when he was competing at the national level, he was taking 20 international units per day of Serostim, a synthetic form of human growth hormone, which would cost about $8,000 per month at ordinary prescription prices (although he was sometimes getting it for free or for about $2,000 through connections with people who had prescriptions for it to fight HIV infection). He said that during his bodybuilding career he \\"lived and died for bodybuilding\\". Piana quit bodybuilding competitions in his last few years and spent his time as a social media personality and promoting his business, called Rich Piana: 5% Nutrition. The meaning of \\"5%\\" in the name of the brand is that \\"5% represents the percentage of people that are out there actually doing whatever it takes to fulfill their dreams, to accomplish their goals, and to live the type of life they want to live.\\" In his post-competition life, he promoted his brand and frequently spoke about the use of steroids and hormones and the associated consequences. He made appearances at fitness expos, and in videos posted on YouTube, he gave advice about diet and fitness routines. He had 1.2 million followers on Instagram and hundreds of thousands of subscribers on YouTube. Personal life Piana was married twice. His first marriage ended in divorce after he had an affair. He then had a longstanding on-again, off-again relationship with fitness model Chanel Jansen. He then married Icelandic bodybuilder Sara Heimisd√≥ttir in 2015. They separated in 2016 and he later accused her of using him to qualify for U.S. residence and stealing money from him. His second marriage was annulled as having occurred under false pretenses, and he resumed his relationship with Jansen, who was his partner at the time of his death. Piana reportedly also had a struggle with opiate addiction at some point, according to Jansen. Death At 1:30 p.m. on August 7, 2017, Piana collapsed while receiving a haircut from Jansen at his home. He was standing at the time and hit his head when he collapsed. Jansen called the 911 emergency operator, and followed their instructions to try to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation until paramedics arrived about 10 minutes into her call. The paramedics confirmed that his heart was not beating properly. His heartbeat was eventually restored, but only after so much time had passed that brain damage had set in from lack of oxygen. After the discovery of crushed white powder along with a straw and a credit card on the table in his home, paramedics administered Narcan, a medication used to counteract a possible opiate overdose. There was later speculation about possible recreational drug use, foul play, or other unknown factors involved in his death. However, Jansen denied that cocaine, heroin, or other drugs were involved ‚Äì saying he had sometimes snorted a high-caffeine pre-workout supplement and that he did not use recreational drugs. Twenty bottles of testosterone were reportedly found in his home. Jansen later said his brain had been deprived of oxygen for over 30 minutes. She also said that in the last few days before his collapse, Piana had exhibited some unusual symptoms including shortness of breath and nausea, and said she was later told these may have been warning signs of an impending cardiac arrest. After spending two weeks in an induced coma to try and reduce swelling to the brain, Piana died on August 25, 2017, at the age of 46. An autopsy revealed \\"significant heart disease\\" and that his heart and liver weighed over twice the average amount for an adult male. Jansen said Piana was well aware that his organs were enlarged, and that this was a known side effect of the steroids and hormones he had been taking, but said he was not aware that this put him at risk for a sudden cardiac arrest. The autopsy was ultimately inconclusive on the cause and manner of death. No toxicology analysis was performed for the autopsy, and no access to any toxicology analysis from the period of his hospital treatment was made available to the medical examiner for study. The hospital had discarded the specimens needed for a toxicology analysis to be later performed, despite specific requests to preserve them for analysis. This led to conspiracy theories about a possible cover-up of the true circumstances and cause of his death. The autopsy report said there was no evidence of recent injury, appearing to rule out physical trauma as a significant factor in his death. He was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Hollywood Hills, California.

He was also a senior member of an influential and large Dhofari desert tribe known as the Bait Kathir (al Kathiri). In 1963 Musallam bin Nufl who had been a member of the Omani Sultan's household staff traveled to meet other Omani dissidents living in Damman in Saudi Arabia, who had twice failed to set up a separate Imamate in the north of the country. Bin Nufl and the DLF would commence guerrilla operations on his return from Iraq and Saudi Arabia later in 1963. The DLF though would wait till 1965 before declaring its intent although it would have to wait until the British withdrawal from neighboring Aden in 1967 before receiving a further injection of support from the now avowed Marxist People's Democratic Republic of Yemen. According to official reports in February 1966 Musallam bin Nufl was seriously injured whilst attempting smuggle arms from Saudi Arabia into Oman, the convoy that he was leading was interdicted by Omani armed forces and all vehicles destroyed. In 1968 a conference of senior leaders of the various liberation factions decided to opt for a more Marxist approach to achieving success against Western-backed royal families. Musallam bin Nufl and other key leaders of the DLF rejected the more Marxist regional anti-British cause, choosing to stick with there more narrow nationalist and separatist agenda in Dhofar. In fact once the highly conservative Sultan Said bin Taimur was replaced by his son Qaboos bin Said in 1970 many in the original DLF leadership group (including Musallam bin Nufl and Yusuf bin Alawi bin Abdullah) allied themselves with new and more progressive Sultan; they reasoned that with the change in ruler in the Sultanate the DLF had achieved what it needed.Ibid. p152 See also * Omani Civil War (1963-76) * Arab Nationalist Movement * Yusuf bin Alawi bin Abdullah * Dhofar Governorate * Yemen * Arabian Sands Other Sources * Encyclopedia of the Stateless Nations: D‚ÄìK ‚Äì Dhofaris * Aden Insurgency: The Savage War in Yemen 1962-67  References  Category:People from Salalah Category:20th- century Omani people Category:20th-century Arabs ","title":"Musallam bin Nufl"},{"id":"55031235","text":"Sophie Maierhofer (born 9 August 1996) is an Austrian footballer who plays for Duisburg in the Frauen-Bundesliga and the Austria national team.

He was signed by the Dallas Cowboys as an undrafted free agent after the 2017 NFL Draft. Early life Thomas was born to Connie Thomas and Eddie Roberts in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Thomas was a two-sport athlete at Elizabeth High School where he played both football and basketball. Thomas captained both teams. In football, Thomas played both running back and cornerback. He played alongside his college quarterback, Phillip Walker who currently plays for the Carolina Panthers. Coming out of high school, Thomas was ranked as three-star prospect by ESPN and the fourth best running back in the state of New Jersey. Thomas also played in the North-South All-Star Football Game. College career Thomas decided to sign with the Temple Owls in 2013. In his freshman team with the Owls, Thomas served as the team's Kick Returner. His play was good enough to warrant a spot on Phil Steele's All- Conference Third Team. He missed a game against the Army Black Knights with a knee injury. During the summer before his Sophomore year at Temple, Thomas transitioned into becoming a full-time running back. He did not start in the team's first game against Vanderbilt, but led the team with 44 years on 12 carries. Temple went on to win that game. Later in the year, Thomas made his first start against Navy. His season highlight came against Tulsa when he ran for 152 yards and caught a 20-yard touchdown, the first of his Temple career. Thomas' best year came as a Junior. He led Temple's offense with 1,262 rushing yards, 1,677 all-purpose yards, and 114 points. That year, Temple went 10‚Äì4 and 7‚Äì1 in their American Conference.

Early and family life The son of Albert and Annie Rust, born after the War of 1812, he studied medicine in Philadelphia and received a medical degree from Jefferson Medical College in 1846. He married Mary Mahala Wood on November 16, 1847. They had one daughter, Julia Rust Wharton (1848-1878) who died in childbirth. Relatives included General George Rust who had also served in the Virginia General Assembly as well as operated several plantations and became Superintendent of the U.S. Arsenel in Harper's Ferry in the 1830s. Another relative, Albert Rust moved to Arkansas and became a Confederate General during that war. Career Dr. Rust practiced medicine in Luray, Page County, Virginia both before and after the American Civil War. He owned slaves before the war began, as had many of his relatives. In November 1861, Dr. Rust went to Mount Jackson in Page County, Virginia where he became a contract physician at the Confederate Military hospital. By September 1862, he had accepted a position and became Acting Assistant Surgeon of the General Hospital at Lynchburg. He was also elected to the Virginia House of Delegates to represent Page County in 1863, and served part-time, although he had moved further south to Lynchburg. After Virginia ceded defeat, Dr. Rust took the required loyalty oath and was elected a delegate to the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1868, representing Page and Shenandoah Counties. A Conservative as was Moses Walton, who also represented the same counties and was a lifelong resident of the Shenandoah Valley, Dr. Rust opposed various penalties that the majority proposed to impose upon former Confederates. Death Rust died in Luray in 1888, survived by his widow, son-in-law Rev. Henry Marvin Wharton (a former lawyer and Confederate who became a Baptist minister, author and head chaplain of Confederate Veterans), and was buried at Green Hill Cemetery in Luray.

Biography It is recorded in Caminha's letter that, return from the voyages to the Indies (after arriving on Brazilian soil), Pedro √Ålvares Cabral left two exiles on the land, one was Afonso Ribeiro and the other may be Jo√£o de Thomar, but the actual identity is unknown, to walk with the Indians and understand their lives and their manners.Pero Vaz de Caminha: A Carta Afonso was condemned for deportation for being \\"guilty of death\\", that is, accused of committing an assassination. He was raised by Jo√£o de Telo and was about to marry Elena Gon√ßalves, who, disillusioned by her fianc√©e, took religious vows. It was registered by Valentim Fernandes, a royal notary, the two exiles stayed for 20 months in that land and, upon returning, told that they lived with the Indians. It is a probability that they were rescued during the expedition of Gon√ßalo Coelho in 1501 and 1502. It is also stated, not long after Cabral's return, that Afonso Ribeiro, at the height of his despair, took possession of a pirogue and he adventured out into the sea, trying to reach the fleet with men who had left him. After paddling for some time, he became exhausted, seeing only the sails of the vessels already at high sea. He was certain that he would not reach the ships. He probably headed to Cape Verde around 1503 or 1504 and possibly later became captain of Cape Verde's Alcatrazes, which may refer to Maio. He might have been the second captain before Jo√£o de Santar√©m. He left the post before 1508, which was later taken by Rodrigo Varela who was the last captain of Alcatrazes.

It was designed to imitate the Phoenix Hall of By≈çd≈ç-in in Uji, south of Kyoto, but on a larger scale. The temple was described in the Kamakura period chronicle, Azuma Kagami. Twice a year, the centerline of the hall was aligned with the sun setting behind Mount Kinkeisan to the west, creating an image of the Pure Land . Nothing remains of the temple today except for some foundation stones and the remnants of earthen walls. The twelfth-century garden with pond, island and ornamental stones has been reconstructed and was designated a Special Historic Site The temple area is about 240 meters east-west by 270 meters north-south. Although part of the site was destroyed by railway construction, the foundation stones and garden remained. As a result of a survey in 1952, it was determined that the main hall was a five by four bay hall, and that there were at least three more buildings. There are few temple ruins from the latter half of the Heian period, and the Mury≈çk≈ç-in ruins are considered to have high academic value.

He flew the only raid in Europe to use Napalm near Arnhem in April 1945. In 1958 he flew an Olympia 419 glider from Lavenham, Suffolk, to Land's End, a distance of 315 miles and a UK glider distance record at that time.  Early life  Ince was born on 23 March 1921 in Glasgow to Douglas Ince, who was the director of an armaments firm which supplied Explosives for civil engineering, and his mother Isobel. He was educated at Kelvinside Academy, Aysgarth School and Cheltenham College.  Military career  = Enlistment and Training = Ince first experienced flying when he was taken up over the River Clyde by a member of the Renfrew Flying Club in a Gypsy Moth. After school he applied to join the Royal Air Force but failed the eye test. However, he was able to join No. 602 Auxiliary Squadron and found that 18 months' commissioned service with the British Army he could be seconded to the air force. He successfully passed the eye test for the secondment and went to Canada for his flight training. = Second World War = During the Allied Invasion of Europe, Ince's reconnaissance aircraft was hit while he photographed the Gestapo Headquarters at Rotterdam in the Netherlands. In this period he also assisted in the destruction of a bridge that collapsed into the river in one piece. Ince also claimed one-eleventh of a kill in the shooting down of a Blohm and Voss Flying boat.  Napalm  Ince participated in what is thought to be the only operational use of napalm in the European campaign. On 12 April 1945, napalm was used against a German strong point near Arnhem in the Netherlands. The eight-foot canister of napalm missed the target but is believed to have damaged the morale of the German troops. Of the attack Ince noted - = Typhoon = Ince was enthusiastic to fly the Hawker Typhoon and told a wing-commander who was recruiting pilots to fly them that a shortened right index finger made flying British aircraft easier than American models. This was due to British aircraft employing a spade grip control stick with thumb activated firing button while American aircraft required the pilot to pull levers and press to fire with a finger. The wing commander readily accepted, with an attrition rate of one in three (150 of the 450 Typhoon pilots would be lost by the war's end) he was wondering how to persuade pilots to volunteer. The shortened index finger, which he dubbed 'Stumpy', was the result of placing it in the Spokes of a bicycle to see what would happen at the age of around seven. Flying with 193 Squadron and 257 Squadron, Ince flew almost 150 Sorties. When flying reconnaissance he modified the front gun mouldings to take an F24 camera, an exercise which yielded unprecedented close up images.  Post War  = Empire Test Pilots' School and Gliding = After the war Ince joined the Empire Test Pilots' School. However, chronic sinusitis prevented his working with high altitude jet aircraft. Ince then turned his attention to gliding and he set a British distance record for gliding with a flight of 315 miles from Lavenham in Suffolk to Land's End in Cornwall. = Civilian Work = Ince worked as an aviation expert for Elliotts, a company specialising in flight systems used in the Lightning and Buccaneer military jets and subsequently Concorde. = Author = Ince penned two books, Combat and Competition in 1992 and Brotherhood of the Skies in 2010.  Personal life  He married Anne Burton in 1954 with whom he had two daughters, Virginia and Rosalind. Ince enjoyed fly-fishing for trout and was a sought after, after dinner speaker. Anne passed away in 1993 and David died on 2 August 2017 at Winchester in Hampshire. He was survived by his two daughters. Publications *Combat and competition.

He married in London, and in the summer of 1803 returned to New York city and began practice. In 1807 he was appointed professor of materia medica and mineralogy in the College of Physicians and Surgeons, being the first to fill such a chair in the United States. On the reorganization of the college in 1811, he was superseded on account of some disagreement with the management, and after 1812 filled the same chair in Queen's, now Rutgers, College, New Jersey. He projected the American Mineralogical Journal in 1810, and edited it until 1814. His chemical analysis \\"of native magnesia from New Jersey\\" made known to science the mineral now called after him, Brucite. He also detected and correctly analyzed the zincite of Sussex County, New Jersey, and published a valuable paper \\"On the Ores of Titanium occurring within the United States.\\" Dr. Bruce was one of the original members of the New York Historical Society, and at the time of his death was a member of many learned societies both in this country and in Europe. He died in New York from apoplexy on February 22, 1818.

The attack occurred in a mountain road in San Sebasti√°n del Oeste, Jalisco. Fifteen policemen were killed and five were wounded; no CJNG casualties were confirmed. According to police reports, as the police convoy reached a part of the road surrounded by mountains, the CJNG opened fire at the police units from the sides using high-caliber rifles, grenade launchers, and explosives with gasoline. The element of surprise prevented the police from repelling the aggression. The CJNG members burned several vehicles along the highway to halt reinforcements. The attack lasted roughly 30 minutes. When government reinforcements reached the scene, the CJNG gunmen had left. The ambush was one of the deadliest single-attack incidents against Mexico's security forces in the ongoing Mexican Drug War. It was also a rare display of bold attacks against law enforcement. In the past, criminal groups in Mexico tended to avoid direct confrontation with security forces. The attack also showcased the manpower and sophistication of the CJNG. The complexity of the attack showed that the CJNG had expertise in military tactics, guerrilla warfare, ambush and counter-ambush training, and in use of explosives. According to investigators, the CJNG carried out the ambush to avenge the arrests and deaths of their fallen comrades from government crackdowns. Ambush and reactions Location of San Sebasti√°n del Oeste, Jalisco (in green), where the ambush took place At around 2:50 p.m. on 6 April 2015, policemen from the Fuerza √önica Jalisco, an elite unit of the Jalisco State Police, drove through a mountain road in Soyat√°n, a rural community in San Sebasti√°n del Oeste, Jalisco. They were driving from Puerto Vallarta to Guadalajara, the state's capital. As they were crossing through the Mascota‚ÄìLas Palmas highway, a road that was covered by mountains on both sides, they were ambushed by suspected members of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG), a criminal group based in the Jalisco. The CJNG gunmen burned several vehicles along the highway to block the road and delay the arrival of potential government reinforcements. As the police units got to a curve, the CJNG gunmen opened fire at them with machine guns and grenade launchers from the side of the mountains. The attack worsened when the CJNG gunmen threw explosives along with jugs of gasoline from strategic locations. Given the element of surprise, the policemen did not have the chance to defend themselves from the aggression. The policemen that got out of the vehicles were shot by the CJNG. Those who stayed inside them died of calcination. In total, 15 police officers were killed in the ambush. 5 more were wounded and transported by helicopter to a wounded-care zone in Puerto Vallarta before being transferred to several hospitals across the Guadalajara Metropolitan Area. Authorities reported them as being in stable condition. No casualties on the CJNG's side were confirmed because the gunmen were able to escape. The police called for reinforcements in Guadalajara. Several police units drove to the area, and a helicopter made it to the scene to provide air support. The Mexican Navy and the Mexican Federal Police (PF) then carried out a search of the surrounding areas to locate the CJNG gunmen. Investigators discovered that the assailants built an encampment in the mountains and waited for the police for as long as 48 hours. Logo of Fuerza √önica Jalisco, an elite unit within the Jalisco State Police Some of the police units were completely burnt and totaled. Firefighters from Puerto Vallarta were called to the scene put down the flames in the burning vehicles. At the scene, investigators found hundreds of high-caliber bullet casings and detonated grenade fragmentation. At least two vehicles from the CJNG were purposely burnt to block the roads, but investigators were not able to determine if the vehicles were owned by uninvolved civilians whose cars were hijacked by the CJNG to block the road. There were no reported injuries during the road blockades carried out by the CJNG. After the shootout took place, the area was cordoned by law enforcement; the road where the attack occurred was closed for security measures. Several drivers complained because they were trying to leave or go to Puerto Vallarta but were unable to do so. That same evening, Jalisco authorities issued a communiqu√© confirming that the attack had taken place, but did not specify the casualties until the following morning. The report stated that the attack against the police was a retaliation for the 23 March death of Heriberto Acevedo C√°rdenas (alias \\"El Gringo\\"), a suspected regional leader of the CJNG. In addition, the report stated that the attack was provoked by the arrest of 15 suspected CJNG members following an assassination attempt against Francisco Alejandro Solorio Ar√©chiga, Jalisco's security commissioner, on 30 March. A day after the attack, Jorge Arist√≥teles Sandoval D√≠az, the Governor of Jalisco, called for a meeting with several high-ranking government officials at the Municipal Palace of Guadalajara (es). In the meeting, authorities confirmed the involvement of the CJNG in the attacks. Among the groups present were local security groups in Jalisco, the Mexican Army, the Attorney General of Mexico (PGR), the PF, the Center for Research and National Security, and the Attorney General of Jalisco. Solorio Ar√©chiga confirmed that the Government of Jalisco did not activate the \\"Red Code\\" alert, which is the highest level in the alert system and is used when the state is considered to be under the highest level of danger, despite rumors that it was activated. He went into detail about the ambush, and gave the press more background on the possible motives behind the attack, including the death of El Gringo and previous arrests of suspected CJNG members as part of the murder attempt against him. He also stated that Sandoval ordered the government to increase security measures and operatives across Jalisco, and that they were receiving support from institutions within the Secretariat of Public Security, a branch of the federal government. The government confirmed that the families of the deceased would receive help with funeral costs and with the policemen's life insurance benefits. Background and possible motives This attack was unusual in the ongoing Mexican Drug War (2006‚Äìpresent) because large scale single-attacks against Mexico's security forces were uncommon. Attacks against security forces usually took place because organized crime members were being pursued and wanted to escape. The planned nature of this attack highlighted that organized crime military tactics were advanced and reaching new levels. In addition, though shootings between criminal groups and law enforcement were common, it was rare for criminal groups to come off victorious in gunfights. This attack was the largest death toll on law enforcement's side since 2009. Because of the one-sided death toll on the police's side, the ambush garnered international attention. Jalisco was one of the four states in Mexico that President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto (2012‚Äì2018) considered a priority for his national security initiative. Between March 2013 and April 2015, at least 70 government officials were killed in Jalisco. According to official reports from the Mexican government, there were 1,025 homicides linked to organized crime in Jalisco in 2014. This was lower than the year before, which totaled 1,485. These numbers are considerably higher than 2009, when Jalisco reported 679 homicides. The month before the ambush, on 19 March 2015, the CJNG attacked a convoy of the National Gendarmerie (es), a branch of the PF, in Ocotl√°n, Jalisco. 11 people were killed; 5 of them were police officers. The attacks were part of a larger campaign by the CJNG to avenge the capture or deaths of its leaders. Investigators believe that the attacks were masterminded by Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes (alias \\"El Mencho\\"), the top leader of the CJNG and one of Mexico's most-wanted drug lords. The intention of the attacks was to avenge their fallen comrades and show the government their manpower to strike back. On 23 March 2015, El Gringo and his suspected henchmen were driving through Zacoalco de Torres, Jalisco, when they encountered the Jalisco State Police. The CJNG members tried to escape, but their vehicle turned over as they sped away from the police units. Two gunmen opened fire at the police officers and threw a grenade at them. Location of Zacoalco de Torres, Jalisco (in green), where the previous attacks took place However, the police was able to neutralize the aggression and kill 4 of them, including El Gringo. One policeman was wounded in the attack; he was shot in the leg and calf, but was reported in stable condition. At the time of his death, El Gringo was suspected by law enforcement to be the regional leader of the CJNG in Zocalco de Torres and other municipalities of the region. There were 10 pending investigations against him, and he was suspected to be involved in gas theft, kidnappings, and in at least nine homicides. They also believed that he was responsible for a number of attacks against law enforcement, including the gunfight that left 4 Mexican Army soldiers dead on 12 May 2014 in Guachinango, Jalisco, and the murder of two police investigators in Tlajomulco de Z√∫√±iga, Jalisco on 29 July 2014. According to investigators, El Mencho reportedly ordered the CJNG to carry out attacks against the government security forces in Jalisco as retaliation for El Gringo's death. On 30 March, suspected CJNG members carried out an attack against Jalisco's security commissioner Solorio Ar√©chiga while he was driving in Zapopan, Jalisco. Over 100 shots were fired from both sides, but Solorio Ar√©chiga's bodyguards were able to repel the CJNG's armed aggression and help him come out of the shooting unharmed. Investigators confirmed that this was a direct assassination attempt against Solorio Ar√©chiga, and that it stemmed from the government crackdowns on the CJNG's leadership structure. A few days after this incident, the CJNG carried out the ambush in San Sebasti√°n del Oeste. Solorio Ar√©chiga insisted that the ambush was also a result of the extensive investigation and arrests carried out by the government after the assassination attempt. State officials stated that it was likely that the CJNG would carry out more attacks after the ambush against Mexican security forces based in Jalisco. In a year, dating from the day of the ambush and back, 24 law enforcement agents in Jalisco were killed in ambush attacks with similar military tactics as ones used in San Sebasti√°n del Oeste.  Analysis of attack and formations  Investigators believe that the CJNG outnumbered the Jalisco State Police during the ambush. According to Luis Carlos N√°jera Guti√©rrez de Velasco, the Attorney General of Jalisco, the CJNG had at least 80 gunmen on their side. The Jalisco State Police had around 40. In an interview with the press, he explained the formation of the police units prior to being attacked by the CJNG. The Jalisco State Police was traveling in 10 vehicles; each vehicle paired up with another one ‚Äì a standard protocol to prevent attacks from organized crime ‚Äì while crossing through the mountain road where they were ambushed. Of the 10 vehicles, only 4 were attacked. Each of those 4 vehicles had 4 officers in them, totaling 16 (out of those 16, only one survived, by faking his own death). The CJNG gunmen were hiding in the mountains' sides in a curve. The gunmen attacked from at least 12 different shooting spots from the top of the mountains. They used a number of high- calibre assault rifles and ammunition. Among them were AK-47s, AR-15s, 40 mm grenades, and M-60 machine guns, which are capable of firing over 500 shots per minute. Some of the bullets found in the crime scene were specifically for detailed perforation. N√°jera Guti√©rrez de Velasco explained that the turning point of the attack occurred when the CJNG threw explosives attached to 20 liters of gasoline from the top of the mountains. This burned 4 police vehicles. Logo with the Spanish acronym of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG), the criminal group responsible for the attacks Some of the policemen were not able to recognize where the shots were coming from. After roughly 30 minutes of gunfire, the CJNG gunmen left through the mountains' forest. Investigators were not able to confirm any casualties from the CJNG's side, but N√°jera Guti√©rrez de Velasco stated that it was not uncommon for organized crime members to retrieve the bodies of their fallen comrades from the battlefield to prevent authorities from investigating and identifying the corpses. He said that the suspects were probably hiding in the nearby mountains, which makes it difficult for law enforcement to conduct a thorough search of the area. N√°jera Guti√©rrez de Velasco admitted that one of the biggest obstacles of the investigation was understanding how the CJNG found out the exact day, time, and place the police convoy was going to pass through the area where they were ambushed. He believes that the CJNG had precise information on the police's journey, and does not discard the possibility that an outsider might have given the CJNG information on the police's arrangements, or that someone inside the police ranks was passing along information to them. Jalisco authorities believe that the attack was planned by members of the CJNG who were experts in military tactics, ambush and counter-ambush training, and guerrilla warfare. Sophisticated attacks like the ones seen in San Sebasti√°n del Oeste had not occurred before in Jalisco during the Mexican Drug War. The attack showcased the CJNG's manpower, discipline in combat, and ability to coordinate complex attacks without experiencing any casualties. In addition, they stated that those who planned the attack were experts in explosives, which made them think that the CJNG had members with former military or police training with experience in such combat. N√°jera Guti√©rrez de Velasco told the press that investigators had evidence that the CJNG was recruiting foreign paramilitary gunmen as foot soldiers in Jalisco. They also had evidence that the CJNG was innovating its arsenal and making its own versions of the AR-15 and M16 assault rifles. Several police officers who were present during the ambush complained that the attack was a result of a series of mistakes made by Jalisco State Police. They asked to have their identities protected to avoid retaliation by organized crime or the police. In an interview with the press, they stated that there were logistical and strategic mistakes the day the attack occurred. According to them, the policemen involved in the ambush were only carrying one load of ammunition for their rifles and handguns. They also stated that the police commander was not with his troops when the ambush occurred, and that he ordered the first part of the convoy to drive further away from the convoy and separate from the rest. He stated that the travel time between the first part of the convoy and his when the police were ambushed was at least 40 minutes. According to the source, a white Suburban passed the convoy and then did zig-zag moves ahead of them, apparently signaling the CJNG that the police convoy was coming up. They explained that when the ambush occurred, their vehicle tires were flattened by the bullets. They were able to escape by driving in reverse at full speed and hiding in a drainage system nearby. N√°jera Guti√©rrez de Velasco denied the claims that the police commander was not in the ambush. He also stated that the police did not go out on duty with one load of ammunition, and that the police commander was in the back part of the convoy, where he was able to call for reinforcements to save a wounded officer.  Immediate aftermath and memorials  Several hours after the ambush, suspected CJNG gunmen based in Zacoalco de Torres killed Miguel √Ångel Caicedo Vargas, the police chief of that municipality. According to investigators, the police chief was kidnapped and tortured before being killed. The assassins stabbed cardboard onto the corpse with a written message warning law enforcement that he was killed for the death of El Gringo. His body was dumped in a car wash shop in Zacoalco de Torres. Witnesses stated that the assassins were driving a white Suburban with Sinaloa license plates. Jalisco authorities stated that this execution and the ambush were both doings of the CJNG. Municipal authorities from Zacoalco de Torres refused to provide details on the murder, and did not say if they were planning to host a memorial ceremony for Caicedo Vargas. Citizens from Zacoalco de Torres said they were worried about the situation in their town; in 15 days, the town hosted the shootout where El Gringo was killed and the murder of its local police chief. Locals stated that there was a strong presence of the Jalisco State Police following both incidents. A memorial service was carried out at the city's convention center on 8 April. The police department where Caicedo Vargas worked, which sat across the street from the convention center, placed a black ribbon in front of their main entrance. The PGR took over the ambush case, and stated that it would charge the suspects with organized crime, illegal possession of firearms, and homicide. This placed the investigation under federal jurisdiction. Picture of Jalisco Governor Jorge Arist√≥teles Sandoval D√≠az in a press conference On 6 April 2015, the Government of Jalisco hosted a memorial ceremony near the crime scene. The ceremony was headed by Jes√∫s Eduardo Almaguer Ram√≠rez, a federal prosecutor from Jalisco. He offered his condolences to the victims' families on behalf of Governor Sandoval D√≠az. Members from all three levels of the Mexican federal government were present during the ceremony. Almaguer Ram√≠rez stated that they were proud of their troops' strength and honor, and thanked them for their support. Fernando Andrade Vicencio, one of the heads of the Jalisco State Police squadrons, read the names of all the officers killed while the officers present yelled \\"present\\" for each of them. The survivors of the ambush received medals for their service. A plaque in honor of the fallen policemen was unveiled following the ceremony. The next day, on behalf of the Government of Jalisco, the state's secretary general Roberto L√≥pez Lara lamented the incident through social media and stated that the government would remember and honor the deceased officers as \\"heroes\\". Solorio Ar√©chiga stated on social media that the \\"cowardly attack\\" would not go unpunished. On 8 April in Mexico City, the Senate of the Republic held a moment of silence for the 15 policemen killed. A larger ceremony was held again on 8 April in Tlaquepaque, Jalisco, this time with Governor Sandoval D√≠az and the victims' families. Over 1,000 people attended the ceremony. In his eight-minute speech, Sandoval D√≠az stated that the attack would not go unpunished. \\"They will not be an extra number in our statistics,\\" he said. He also stated that the assassins were going to \\"pay\\" for what they did, and clarified that it was not a cry for war, but rather a cry for peace and justice. He also asked all police corporations to continue fighting organized crime. Solorio Ar√©chiga read the names of all the officers killed, but had to stop momentarily to sob. For each of the names, the policemen repeated the same process as before, yelling \\"present\\" for each of them. After that, the police band did a taps call. Once it concluded, the audience clapped for one minute. The coffins were wrapped in the Flags of Jalisco. In front of each coffin was a flower arrangement, the banner of the Fuerza √önica branch, and a framed photograph of the victim. Each of the victims' family members was given an official banner of the state of Jalisco. A year later, on 6 April 2016, the Government of Jalisco hosted another ceremony near the ambush site with the victims' families. Fuerza √önica banners were placed across the mountainous road where the attack occurred.  Government crackdowns  Chart released by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioning the CJNG and its two leaders On 8 April 2015, two days after the ambush, the United States Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned the CJNG under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (\\"Kingpin Act\\") for his involvement in international drug smuggling operations. The sanction was a joint investigation conducted by the Treasury and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) office in Los Angeles as part of a larger effort with their Mexican counterparts to sanction drug trafficking groups in Mexico. The sanction extended to El Mencho, his brother-in-law Abigael Gonz√°lez Valencia, and Los Cuinis. As part of the sanction, all the U.S.-based assets and/or assets in control of U.S. individuals on behalf of El Mencho, Gonz√°lez Valencia, the CJNG, and Los Cuinis, were frozen in the U.S. In addition, the act prohibited U.S. citizens from engaging in business activities with them. According to the OFAC's announcement, the CJNG was one of Mexico's rapidly growing criminal groups. Through their \\"use of violence and corruption\\", they said, the CJNG was able to consolidate itself as one of Mexico's leading drug trafficking organizations. On 11 April, Jalisco authorities told the press that investigators concluded that the prime suspect in the ambush was one of El Gringo's family members, who ordered the attack as a retaliation for his death. According to government reports, this suspect was arrested on 19 June 2012 by the Mexican Army for allegedly being involved in organized crime and drug trafficking in Michoac√°n. El Gringo's family member was then transferred to the PGR installations in Apatzing√°n, Michoac√°n. On 21 June, an armed commando stormed the installations, subdued an officer from the Federal Investigation Agency (AFI), ordered him to open the prison cells, and rescued El Gringo's relative and another man. The two men were Julio Acevedo C√°rdenas and Joel Contreras C√°rdenas. Before taking off, the gunmen killed the AFI officer. When the PGR found out about the incident, they issued a national alert at the country's border exit stations to prevent them from leaving Mexico. On 22 September, the PF and the Army arrested Giovanni Castro Urbano (alias \\"El Duende\\"), a suspected high-ranking leader of the CJNG and close associate of El Mencho, in Ameca, Jalisco. The arrest came after a 15-minute shootout between the CJNG and the law enforcement officers. According to government sources, El Duende was acting as El Gringo's successor in the CJNG's leadership structure, and was suspected of being involved in multiple attacks against security forces, including the incident in San Sebasti√°n del Oeste, Guachinango, and one in San Mart√≠n de Hidalgo, Jalisco in 2014, where the CJNG carried out an attack against the PF and the Army. Four military men were wounded and one was killed. On 12 March 2016, state authorities in Lagos de Moreno, Jalisco arrested Miguel P√©rez Contreras, a suspected CJNG member who was reportedly involved in the Guachinango and San Sebasti√°n del Oeste attacks. Since he was arrested with a large arsenal of weapons, he was placed on PGR jurisdiction. Federal authorities interrogated him and discovered that he was part of a CJNG cell based in Regi√≥n Valles, Jalisco. In addition, they discovered that he was in contact with a female based in the United States who helped recruit people from American private security companies to work for the CJNG.

A French-language edition was published by Oriflam under license from Chaosium under the name Les Dieux Nomades in 1994. A free version for online play without the rulebook was released for the Vassal Engine in 2012. Chaosium republished the rulebook in PDF format in 2017. History It is the second part of the Dragon Pass trilogy that began with White Bear and Red Moon. Although some counters for the planned third game were included with Nomad Gods, the third game of the trilogy was never published. Rules updates and additions were published in Wyrm's Footnotes. The 1977 game comes with a 22\\" x 26\\" hex map, 252 counters, and a profusely illustrated 72-page rulebook. In 1994 the game was revised and released as Les Dieux Nomades in French release by Oriflam. This adapted the original game to an updated version of the Dragon Pass rules. The original designers Stafford and Robert Corbett, are credited along with Stephen Martin who led its development. Along with new units, all parts of the game were throughly revised including the game system. Production quality increased with full colour components. Expansions and corrections were included in The Book of Drastic Resolutions: Drastic Prax. The 2012 Vassal release was a digitized copy of the original 1977 board and counters. The rulebook was published without the counters and map in 2017 by Chaosium as part of their Khan of Khans Kickstarter. Khan of Khans is set in the same background as Nomad Gods, but is a family card game. Gameplay Playable by 2-5 people, each controls a nomadic tribe that roams a post- apocalyptic landscape called the Plains of Prax. Each tribe uses a unique set of combat skills as well as magic and the summoning of tribal deities to steal herd animals from other tribes. A counter called The Eternal Battle, representing gods frozen in time, moves randomly across the board, often destroying tribesmen that it encounters. The game presents six different scenarios that often require, in part, capturing herds of livestock from another tribe. Reception In the December-January 1977 edition of White Dwarf (Issue #4), Lew Pulsipher liked the unique setting, and the well organized rules that \\"use a step by step format, so even a novice fantasy gamer shouldn't have much trouble absorbing the game slowly but surely.\\" Due to the complexity of the game, Pulsipher recommended that gamers start by playing the prequel, White Bear and Red Moon first, \\"because it resembles conventional two-player games more than Nomad Gods does, and because the second edition [of White Bear and Red Moon] has corrected typos and ambiguous rules, a treatment, Nomad Gods would profit from.\\" Pulsipher concluded by recommending the game: \\"You won't find more stimulating fantasy boardgames anywhere.\\" He gave the game an overall rating of 9 out of 10. In the July‚ÄìAugust 1977 edition of The Space Gamer (Issue No. 12), Robert C. Kirk liked Nomad Gods, commenting that \\"The game is easy to learn. The rules are eminently readable.\\" In the May 1978 edition of Dragon (Issue 14), J. Ward thought the detailing of the separate tribes and the well-written rules were reason enough for buying the game. He also liked the addition of magical combat. He did think a quirk in the rules gave tribes with fast bowmen an unfair advantage, and questioned why counters that could only be used in the planned third game of the Dragon Pass trilogy were included with this game. Ward concluded though, that \\"All in all, the game Nomad Gods works on so many levels that it can‚Äôt fail to be a real pleaser.\\" References Category:Board games introduced in 1977 Category:Chaosium games Category:Greg Stafford games ","title":"Nomad Gods"},{"id":"55032335","text":"is a Japanese march composed by Hajime Fuse with lyrics by Masanori Yokoyama.

Reception =Box office= In North America, All Saints was released on August 25, 2017, alongside Birth of the Dragon and Leap!, and was projected to gross around $3‚Äì4 million from 846 theaters in its opening weekend. It made $150,000 on its first day and $1.6 million over the weekend, finishing 15th at the box office. The film's low opening was attributed to Hurricane Harvey hitting Texas and surrounding areas‚Äìtypically faith-based regions‚Äìcausing theaters to close, as well the boxing match between Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor on the Saturday. The combined weekend box office was the lowest-grossing since September 2001. =Critical response= On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 95% based on 19 reviews, with an average rating of 7.2/10.

Biography Sopaios was a native of the Bosporan Kingdom who was greatly influential during the reign of Satyros I. Sopaios controlled major regions of the kingdom and the king's military forces. His daughter, named Theodosia, married one of Satyros's sons, Leukon. Sopaios, as an aristocratic nobleman, was able to send his son to the school of Isocrates in Athens.

Players obtain cargo, such as guns, food and water, through purchase or by taking them from raider trucks which periodically attack the players. Players fulfill private contracts to obtain money and new upgrades to their truck's abilities, while the first player to complete three publicly available contracts, which range from digging up treasure to hauling a nuclear warhead across the country, wins the game.

Players can also battle raiders, make trades at outposts, and complete missions on behalf of different factions in the game. Players have the choice of one of five available drivers to play, each of which has its own unique backstory, starting abilities, and rig.

Discovery  The Back Beach beetle was described in 1927 by Albert E. Brookes from specimens collected in 1925 at Tahuna Beach, Nelson by the director of the Cawthron Institute, R. J. Tillyard. Brookes named the new species Cillenum tillyardi in Tillyard's honour. Cillenum tillyardi was later renamed Zecillenus tillyardi, but Zecillenus in turn became a subgenus of the very large carabid beetle genus Bembidion.  Description  This small flightless species is approximately 4 mm long and 1.3 mm wide. It occurs in 1‚Äì2 mm wide burrows at the high-tide mark in sandy sediment without too much mud.  Conservation  Bembidion tillyardi has so far only been recorded from Back Beach, a sandspit on an inlet behind Tahuna Beach, Nelson. The beach is relatively recent in origin: originally the Waimea River outlet was on its landward side, and it was the eastern end of a long sandbank stretching back to where Rabbit Island is now. When the Waimea River carved a new outlet through the bank in 1875, sand began to accumulate in the Tahuna area, with dunes building up at the start of the 20th century, and the Back Beach inlet appearing by 1914. A recreation ground was created, and the area hosted car racing on the beach until the 1960s. In recent years, the main channel in the Waimea estuary has been moving eastward, gradually eroding away Back Beach. B. tillyardi's habitat is also threatened by sea level rise and the depositing of fine sediment that the beetle cannot tolerate. Another threat to this species is recreational use of the beach, especially illegal use of off-road vehicles. B. tillyardi was given \\"Nationally Critical\\" status by the Department of Conservation.

Levine bought the rights to make a film out of the Romain Gary story in 1964, but spent years trying to get a suitable screenplay; those who worked on the project included author and critic Hollis Alpert. At various times Peter O'Toole, Christopher Jones, Warren Beatty and Jon Voight were reportedly considered for the starring role; Robert Redford was also approached but turned the part down. Finally Levine gave a trio of UCLA film students a $750,000 budget and free rein to do what they wanted, resulting in a film that had little to do with the book. Reception Roger Greenspun of The New York Times wrote, \\"Almost everybody in 'The Ski Bum' is first rate, much too good for the material, with special honors to Joseph Mell as the ubiquitous Burt Stone and Lori Shelle as his emotionally mature daughter.\\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film zero stars out of four and wrote that the young filmmakers \\"are moderately successful only when photographing snow. Each scene involving what they think is human interaction is either sick or sickly. The film's electronic music and many echo chamber sound effects (which signal trauma) end up being the equivalent of scratches on a blackboard.\\" Variety wrote that the changes from the novel to the film were \\"mostly for the worst\\" and that there was \\"very little to say about the final cut, since film has so little to say itself.\\"\\"Film Reviews: The Ski Bum\\". Variety. January 20, 1971. 13. Jeanne Miller of The San Francisco Examiner called the film \\"an earnest, thoughtful, but ultimately unsuccessful attempt to portray the anguish of its existential hero, a primitive drifter hopelessly trapped in the externals of a materialistic society ... [the filmmakers] seem to view the corporate greed of this affluent society as an insidious poison that inevitably affects everyone it touches.

Life Louise Augustine Gleizes had worked as a kitchen maid, and was sent to the Salp√™tri√®re Hospital at age 14 on 21 October 1875. Before this, she had been in a nurse's care in early life, and after, she was a nurse in a religious boarding school where she suffered corporal punishment. She was molested when she was 10 years old and raped by her mother‚Äôs lover when she was 13. While she was a patient of the Salp√™tri√®re Hospital, Charcot, who treated her, would hypnotize her so she would demonstrate her supposed hysteria. Sigmund Freud and Edgar Degas, among others, came to see this. Photographs were taken of her then, which became known as the most infamous visual representations of women's experiences of hysteria. Hysteria included expressions of uncontrolled emotions, interpersonal manipulations, sexual assertiveness, and seizures, including postures of a physiological contortion. The photographic images of Gleizes as evidence toward Charcot's case conceptualization, the 'truth' of hysteria in women, and the performative gestures of psychological suffering thus solidified the women's experiences of distress and continue to influence diagnoses. Current discourse organizes Gleizes symptoms in light of the sexual abuse and other violence she experienced as a younger woman. In light of this victimization, the nature of her \\"performance\\" as a patient becomes questionable when judged by ethical standards of practice. Of further ethical note, when Gleizes no longer agreed to be photographed, she was admitted to solitary confinement in the Hospital. In 1880, she escaped the hospital, disguised in men's clothes. After that she was never seen again. Charcot's work with her made him more famous, and he remains best remembered for it. In popular culture Jean-Luc Godard compares the figure of Lilian Gish in the film Way Down East to Gleizes (referred to as \\"Augustine at Salpetri√®re\\") in his documentary series Histoire(s) du cin√©ma. Winona Ryder appears to mimic Gleizes film stills in the 1992 adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula as she begins to experience early states of vampirism. A 2012 French historical drama film, Augustine, is about a love affair between Charcot and Gleizes. In reality, there was no sexual relationship between her and Charcot, although questions have been raised about the ethics of her treatment and the overt sexualization that Charcot and other staff demanded of her, and her poor treatment when she refused to continue the performance. The play Photographs of A by Daniel Keene, about her, was performed in 2014 at Melbourne Theatre Company‚Äôs NEON Festival.

An all black cast and crew, including budding actor Yaphet Kotto in his first role, created the film. Cast Yaphet Kotto as Othello Benjamin Ashburn as Montano Olive Bowles as Emilia Louis Chisholm, Jr. as Cassio Audrey Dixon as Desdemona Richard Dixon as Iago Douglas Gray as Roderigo Lincoln Pope as Duke of Venice Liz White as Bianca Jim Williams as Brabantio Production White's Othello began as an acclaimed performance in 1960-1961 at Shearer Summer Theater, White's own repository company on Martha's Vineyeard, and in 1960 in Harlem. Shearer began the repository with a mission to create more roles for the black actors and more jobs for black theater technicians. The entire cast and crew of the film are black. =Filming= With help from Charles Dorkins, White directed the film over the summers from 1962-1966. Most involved with the project were students or maintained part- or full-time jobs during filming‚Äîeven White worked as a stage dresser during production. The film was further delayed when Yaphet Kotto began his Hollywood movie career. =Casting= White herself played Bianca and she enlisted her son and daughter-in-law, Richard and Audrey Dixon, as Iago and Desdemona. Release The film did not screen until 1980, when it had its official debut at Howard University. In White's biography in the promotion materials for the debut, it reads: \\"[Liz] works out of her apartment in the Dunbar complex in Harlem and at the editing space she rents in the Screen Building on Broadway. She is cutting and editing a print of her feature length film, \\"Othello\\", sleeping on the studio floor some nights.\\" The film's release was in part due to White's reluctance to label the film an \\"art\\" film. She attempted to market the film to various studios, including Warner Brothers. It has never been released commercially.

It is known from only the type species, S. songwensis. Gorsak & O'Connor's phylogenetic testing suggest Shingopana is more closely related to the South American titanosaur family of Aeolosaurini than any of the titanosaurs found so far in North & South Africa.  Discovery and naming  Part of the holotype was discovered in 2002 by scientists affiliated with the Rukwa Rift Basin Project, which was run by Patrick O'Connor and Nancy Stevens. The rest of the skeleton was excavated during the following years. The genus was officially named in 2017.  Description  Shingopana was a quadrupedal Aeolosaurin sauropod that would have reached up to long when fully grown, smaller than the average sauropod. = Skeleton = The holotype was damaged by insect bore holes shortly after the animal died. Shingopana is known from a partial jaw, represented by the angular bone. Shingopana is also known from four cervical vertebrae; with two of these vertebrae having preserved cervical ribs and another isolated cervical rib. Shingopana instead had remnants of a bulbous expansion on the incompletely preserved cervical vertebrae, which probably helped to strengthen its neck. Four ribs have been preserved with the holotype, but none are complete. The ribs had flanged edges, but their function is currently unknown. An almost complete humerus is known and a partial pubis were also discovered.  Classification  Shingopana has been classified witnin the Aeolosaurini. It has been added into the Aeolosaurini cladogram by Silva et al. (2019).  Palaeoecology  The holotype was discovered in the Upper Cretaceous Galula Formation of the Rukwa Rift Basin in Tanzania. It would have coexisted with the sauropods Rukwatitan and Mnyamawamtuka, the mesoeucrocodiles Pakasuchus and Rukwasuchus, the mammal Galulatherium, an unnamed notosuchian, an unnamed turtle, an unnamed theropod and two types of lungfish (Lupaceradotus and an unanmed genus).

Written by Jerome Schwartz & Jane Espenson and directed by Sharat Raju, it premiered on ABC in the United States on November 10, 2017. In the episode, Roni and Henry are suddenly discovering that they have a past as mother and son, while in the New Enchanted Forest's past Regina, feeling like a third wheel in Henry and Cinderella's sudden relationship, is lured into a scheme by a determined Drizella, which could have consequences in the present day.  Plot  = Opening sequence = A Tower is featured in the background. = In the Characters' Past = As Henry and Cinderella take off into the forest, the two are met by thieves who want the motorcycle, but suddenly Regina appears and ready to help, only to have Henry telling her that he and Cinderella are handling them fine. Later on, Regina takes a stroll in the woods when she sees a hooded figure attacked by sentient vines. She saves her, only to discover that the hooded figure is Drizella, who is on a mission to steal magic. Regina starts training Drizella but after a series of failures, Drizella's talents finally come through when she rescues Regina from a falling tower by smashing the concrete in mid-air using magic. Rumpelstiltskin appears suddenly, and catches up with Regina, telling him of the wonderful life with Belle. He reminds Regina that, just as the Regina's mother Cora was practically omniscient, so too must be Lady Tremaine. Heeding those words, Regina eavesdrops on Tremaine through a magic mirror and discovers that she plans to take Drizella's heart and place it in Anastasia after failing to get Henry's heart, leading Regina to suspect that Drizella plans to kill her mother. Drizella wants Regina to help her but Regina refuses, not wanting her to embrace darkness. When Prince Gregor shows up ready to kill Tremaine, Regina appears and attempts to intervene. It turns out that it was a double-cross set up by Drizella, to lure Gregor into a trap. Drizella uses magic to impale Gregor with black vines, and as a result her heart turns dark, successfully making her heart unsuitable for Tremaine's plan. She tells Regina she will cast a dark curse just like Regina had, to cause her mother pain, only this time, the curse will be unbreakable. Later on, Regina and Henry spend time together to bond and patch over differences, with Regina saying to him that being his mother will always be her primary role. = In Seattle = At Roni's, the photo of Henry and Regina becomes the subject of speculation. Lucy runs into the bar to see the photo, and as she looks at it, she identifies Roni as Regina, Henry's mother. She vows to find a way to prove it. Roni contacts Weaver to get information about the adoption in return for a favor. Weaver comes through and gives Roni papers containing information, and Roni, by writing on a bar napkin, discovers that the handwritten signature at the bottom matches her own handwriting. However, Ivy and the witch already have been planning to use Roni by way of the photo, utilizing the lavender flowers from the garden to create a potion (earlier on, Victoria is learning that the flower is giving her headaches). Ivy later visits Roni to have a talk about the photo and the adoption, but as they are about to have a drink, Ivy slips the potion made by the witch into Roni's drink, and as Roni drinks, she \\"wakes up\\" and her real memories of being Regina are returned. Drizella informs Regina that it was her tutelage that gave her the ability to cast the new curse, and therefore it will be difficult to break because if Henry and Jacinda experience true love's kiss everyone will be in jeopardy, reminding her of a special contingency that was put into the curse that would hurt Henry if she didn't comply. Regina cries in her bar, then goes to meet Henry at the park. When she asks him what he remembers about his mother, he reveals that he was born in prison to an unknown mother and grew up in the system (as these are his cursed memories). She yearns to tell him who she really is, but refrains from doing so. In between the events, Jacinda is upset with Henry about Instagram photos from Halloween night that were schemingly posted by Ivy. But after being encouraged by Roni to pursue Jacinda, Henry shows up at the food truck with a large radio and convince Jacinda to forgive him, and to ask her out on a date, and offered to help her start the engine on the vehicle. Meanwhile, as Weaver checks out of the hospital, Rogers suspects Tilly and Weaver are holding something back after he talked to Tilly, who then told Rogers about Eloise, explaining in riddles that the information from the sketch book is somehow closer than he thought. However, someone else has already beaten Rogers to the punch; the suspect with the tattooed hand is found murdered at his home.

History  = Haji Abul Hossain = 1940‚Äì1996 Very few men have a profound and lasting effect on the world. Without the shadow of a doubt, Haji Abul Hossain is one of the rare few. He was a famous businessman, philanthropist, entrepreneur, prolific social worker in Tangail District and was born in Dighulia, Tangail, Bangladesh on 30 November 1940. He took part in the 1971 liberation war effort. The glorious, influential life of Tangail's greatest figure ended 10 September 1996. He was just 56 years old in 1996. Being of insufficient financial support from family, he did not receive much of an education. He started some business. Hard work, honesty, dedication, courage and patience are the golden rules by which he lived his life and managed his works. He succeeded. Of course, success in business is only a single part of a successful life. Haji Abul Hossain certainly recognized this fact. That is why he has shown such enormous generosity in his efforts to fight poverty and to support human rights as well as other worthwhile causes. He dedicated himself to the service of the suffering humanity and his long chequered life for advancement of the backward community in Tangail. =Awards and honors= In appreciation of his humanitarian work the Tangail People conferred on Haji Abul Hossain, the title of ‚ÄúDanobir‚Äù. In 1396 (Bengali Year) He was posthumously awarded the \\"Gyan Taposh Dr.Muhammad Shohidullah Gold Medal\\" by the Bangladesh Shilpo Kristy Sangsad as a recognition of his works.

An isolated bushland remnant surrounded by a heavily industrialized and urban area. Listed rare species of plants recorded in this reserve include the downy wattle and the vine Vincetoxicum woollsii.  Geography  Average annual rainfall is . Soils are relatively infertile, based on Triassic sedimentary rocks, the soil base consists of Bringelly shale. Average monthly annual maximum temperatures for nearby Bankstown range between 17.5 for July and 27.7 for January. Average monthly annual minimum temperatures range from 3 for July and 18 for February. Frosts are seldom recorded in winter. Temperatures in summer occasionally exceed 40 degrees C. Prevailing summer winds are easterly to south-easterly, winter winds are westerlies.  History  The local indigenous Australian people were the Bidjigal group of the Darug people. Norfolk Reserve is a part of land that was acquired, by the Urban Transit Authority in 1948. A bus depot opened in 1958. The bushland was left purposely to act as a buffer between the Depot and surrounding residential areas.  Flora  The area is a dry forest, the canopy is mostly populated by four species of eucalyptus trees, primarily Woollybutt and Broad leaf Ironbark. Grey box and Beyers Ironbark are present. Occasionally paperbarks form the canopy (Melaleuca nodosa and Melaleuca decora). 121 indigenous plants have been recorded in this small area. The forest classification is Cooks River Clay Plain Scrub Forest, listed as an endangered ecological community in 1995. Less than 1% of the original area of this community currently exists in the form of a number of small remnants such as Norfolk Reserve.  Fauna  This small forest reserve has few indigenous vertebrate species. However, Bearded dragons and small lizards (skinks) have been recorded. Previously, the rare Regent Honeyeater (Xanthomyza phrygia) and the Bent-wing Bat (Miniopterus schreibersii) have been recorded nearby. Norfolk Reserve may provide some habitat for these species if they occur nearby today. The White-throated needletail may be seen in the skies above in summer.  Bush regeneration  Forest conservation work is in progress. Weeds include Blackberry (Rubus fruticosus). Paddy's (Sida rhombifolia), Bidens (Bidens pilosa), Fleabane (Conyza sp.) The general health of the vegetation is fair to good. The southern part of the reserve is in particularly good condition, with few weeds.

Background In 1982, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Television was renamed MGM/UA Television Distribution after the merger with United Artists the previous year. In 1984, MGM/UA TV launched an ad hoc TV network, MGM/UA Premiere Network, with movies. The MGM/UA Premiere Network along with MCA TV's Universal Pictures Debut Network came as a response to the weakened network television market for films in packages. By the summer of 1984, the network had signed affiliation agreements with eight television stations in large markets. The service was expected to broadcast 24 movies in double-runs once a month for two years. MGM received 10¬Ω minutes of advertising time within a two-hour movie telecast, while its stations would retain 11¬Ω minutes. 100 television stations were signed as affiliates by October 1984, with the planned launch pushed back and set for November 10 of that year. The Premiere Network was distributed in part by LBS Communications. By 1993, the name was shortened to simply the MGM Premiere Network.

The post holder was Commander-in-Chief of the English navy's North and Western Fleets operating in the North Sea, the English Channel, the Southern Irish Sea and Atlantic from 1364 to 1414.  History  The origins of the office Admiral of the North and West dates back to 7 July 1364 with appointment of Sir Ralph de Spigurnell, originally styled Admiral of the North and West Sea. The office was styled by different names from its establishment such as Admiral of the North and West Stations. From 28 April 1369 to 24 November 1377 there was no further appointments until the post was revived with the appointment of Michael, Lord Wingfield he held the office very briefly until December 1377 when it once again ceased. On 10 December 1386 it was revived again with the appointment of Richard FitzAlan, Earl of Arundel he held the post until 18 May 1389. There would be a further four appointments from May 1389 to April 1400 before the office ceased again. It was established for the final time on 23 December 1406 the command being given to John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset. The last Commander-in-Chief was Thomas Beaufort, Earl of Dorset, from 1408 until 1414. It was considered one the English Navy's most important Naval Commands from the mid-14th century until the beginning of the 15th century. Two of the office holders Sir John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset and Thomas Beaufort, Earl of Dorset both retained the title for life. The first royal commission as Admiral to a naval officer was granted in 1303. By 1344 it was only used as a rank at sea for a captain in charge of a fleet or fleets. :Rank and Role The naval defence of England from the end of the 13th century was divided into regional commands or 'admiralties' until the end of the fourteenth Century. The appointment of an admiral was not regarded by the English government at the time as an honorary post subordinate to a military rank, their importance attached to their office can be confirmed by the recording of their allowances paid recorded in the Calendar of Patent Rolls. In the fourteenth Century Admirals were paid a respectable salary which was only granted because the position was viewed as substantially important. In addition the rank of admiral was only granted to men of high prestige within feudal hierarchy, most recipients of the office were usually knights but more often earls.Rodger pp. 131-142 The Admirals duties usually consisted of assembling fleets for naval expeditions undertaken by the monarch on campaign, maintaining order and discipline and supervising the work of the Admiralty Courts for each region. On major military expeditions the Admiral would go to sea with their fleets and accompany the overall Commander-in-Chief of both sea and land forces usually the King himself but sometimes a nobleman of higher rank than the admiral. Their role was to observe and direct naval battles but not necessarily taking part in them, themselves. However, from 1344 onward their role was moving from primarily administrative role to that of a sea of a seagoing command.National Museum of the Royal New Zealand Navy In 1337 the first known record of the appointment of a \\"vice-admiral' was granted to a Nicholas Ususmaris, a Genoese, he was made Vice-Admiral of the King's fleet of galleys, and all other ships of Aquitaine. However these appointments were far and few between. There was two further instances of the appointment of Vice- Admirals to Sir Thomas Drayton as Vice-Admiral of the Northern Fleet and Sir Peter Bard Vice-Admiral of the Western Fleet both on 28 July 1338. Special assistants were appointed to handle two important sub-divisions of the admirals powers. The first was the admiral's lieutenant, or deputy, referred to as sub-admirals, who handled administrative and legal duties and each of these admirals had one and often retained more knowledge than the Admiral himself in relation to the sea and coastal communities. It would not be until the early 15th century that they would appointed on a more regular basis however they were referred to at this time as the admirals Lieutenant-General this office eventually became known as the Lieutenant of the Admiralty. The second was the Wardens of the Coast for each region who were responsible for the direction and co-ordination of the fleet, the equipping of boats and processing payments to sailors and superintendence of the Sea Guard Militia assigned to each coastal county. From the mid fourteenth century there was a move to centralise these regional naval authorities as seen with the appointment of the Admiral of the Southern, Northern and Western fleets sometimes referred to as Admiral of the Fleet or Admiral of England and the Admiral of the North and West this tendency towards unifying regional naval authorities under one admiral eventually led to the creation of the office of the Lord-Admiral of England The Admirals were logistically supported by the Clerk of the Kings Ships who looked after all the navy's finances whilst victualling of the navy was handled by another one of Kings Clerks.

Competing in the 74 kg weight division, he has won 3 Deaflympics Gold Medals and a Bronze Medal in 4 appearances. He won Gold Medals at 2005 Summer Deaflympics (Melbourne, Australia), 2013 Summer Deaflympics (Sofia, Bulgaria) and 2017 Summer Deaflympics (Samsun, Turkey). In addition to that, he also won a Bronze at 2009 Summer Deaflympics (Taipei, Chinese Taipei). Virender also won the World Title at the World Championship and has Gold, Silver and Bronze apiece at the three World Deaf Wrestling Championships that he has been to. Virender won a Gold at 2016 World Deaf Wrestling Championship (Tehran, Iran), a Silver at 2008 World Deaf Wrestling Championship (Yerevan, Armenia) and a Bronze at the 2012 World Deaf Wrestling Championship (Sofia, Bulgaria). This makes it 7 medals at the 7 international events that Virender has been a part of. In July 2015, he received the prestigious Arjuna Award ‚Äì India's sporting honour. Before that, he had received the Rajiv Gandhi State Sports Award, awarded by the Government of Delhi, India.  Biography  Virender Singh was born to a farmers' family of Sasroli village, near Jhajjar in Haryana. His father, Ajit Singh, was a CISF Jawan, while his mother, Manna Devi, is a homemaker. Virender was inspired to take up wrestling by his father and uncle, who were wrestlers as this was a family tradition passed on by generations. Virender, as a deaf kid, was bullied in the village and his uncle Surinder Pehelwan brought him to Delhi to live at the CISF akhara with him and his father. Watching his father and uncle wrestle, Virender developed an interest in wrestling and they also found talent in him and started honing his skills. Kumar trained in pehlwani wrestling at major wrestling akharas, namely the Chhatrasal Stadium and Guru Hanuman akhara. With minimal funds and poor training facilities for wrestling in India, even for the Deaflympics team, his family made sure he obtained the necessary dietary supplements by sending him tinned milk, ghee and fresh vegetables. Kumar is presently employed with the Sports Authority of India as a Junior Sports Coach training the next generation of wrestlers.  Career  Virender started training in pehlwani at the CISF akhada at the age of 9. He was trained at the akhada by Surinder Pehelwan, his uncle, later by Dronacharya Awardee Coaches Maha Singh Rao and Ramphal Singh. Virender's first success came at the National Rounds of the World Cadet Wrestling Championships in 2002, where he won the Gold Medal. Even though the win meant automatic qualification for the world event, he was unfairly disqualified from going to the world event by the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI), citing his deafness as the reason for doing so. It has to be said here that the world body doesn't disqualify deaf players or disabled players from the event but the WFI sent the Silver medallist and Virender was ignored. This was his initiation into the world of discrimination which dogged him all throughout his career. After this, in the year 2005, he got to know of the Deaflympics, formerly The World Games for the Deaf or The Silent Games, and keen on showing his mettle made it to the 2005 Summer Deaflympics in Melbourne, Australia and won the Gold Medal. There was no stopping him after that as he had found recognition amongst his own. He never gave up on the dream of representing India at the Olympics, but consistent discrimination and lack of knowledge on the part of the Wrestling Federation of India meant that he could never get referees that could govern matches for the deaf. He focused on the deaf games and in 2008 went to the World Deaf Wrestling Championships in Armenia, and secured a Silver. Post that, at the 2009 Summer Deaflympics he bagged the Bronze in Taipei, China. At the 2012 World Deaf Wrestling Championships, he won a bronze in Sofia, Bulgaria. Again, at the 2013 Summer Deaflympics his performance was stellar earning him a Gold Medal. This was to be the best phase of his career as post this he followed it up with a Gold Medal at the 2016 World Deaf Wrestling Championships in Tehran, Iran. And this was followed by the 2017 Summer Deaflympics in Samsun, Turkey where he again won a Gold Medal. Virender was awarded the Arjuna Award for his stellar contribution to Indian Sports.  Film on his Life  Virender Singh also became the subject of a documentary titled, Goonga Pehelwan. The name of the film translates to 'The Mute Wrestler', which although is a politically incorrect term was used because that is how the world knew him and his real name was almost forgotten in the wrestling circles and even his family usually referred to him as Goonga. The 45-minute documentary film went on to play at film festivals across the Globe and also won the highest Indian film honour, National Film Award in the year 2015.  Government Snub  Even after his successes, he has been consistently ignored for top sporting honours and cash awards for much of his career. Even though the competition levels at the Paralympics and the Deaflympics are similar and both events are officially sanctioned by the International Olympic Committee, the Government of India has paid no attention to the Deaf Games. The Paralympic Sports Movement has found much support with awards at all levels for para-athletes but deaf athletes have been ignored throughout, thereby pushing Virender Singh and athletes of his kind into the background and financially difficult circumstances.

The album was written entirely by Mitski, with production handled by Patrick Hyland, who also produced her previous record, Retired from Sad, New Career in Business (2013). The title of the album is a quote from the Simpsons episode \\"Faith Off\\". Background and release After graduating from Purchase College's Conservatory of Music, where she studied studio compositions and released her first two albums as student projects, Mitski learned to play the guitar and began work on her third studio album. The projects, combined with completing her degree while working outside jobs to pay rent, left Mitski exhausted, a state which heavily influenced the creation of the album. The album was recorded mostly in houses and makeshift studios with a select group of musicians and friends and represented a departure from Mitski's classical training showcased in her orchestral, piano-based first two albums. The lead single of the album, \\"First Love / Late Spring\\", was released on May 15, 2014, with Double Double Whammy announcing Mitski joined their label roster and will release a full-length record later that year. The album was announced on September 16 alongside the release of the second single, \\"Townie\\". Two music videos were released for \\"Townie\\", the first directed by Allyssa Yohana and premiered on Rookie on November 9, 2014, and the second directed by Faye Orlove and premiered on The Fader on March 9, 2015. She released two more singles, \\"I Don't Smoke\\" on September 29 and \\"I Will\\" on October 21. The album was reissued with four new bonus tracks on April 7, 2015 through Don Giovanni Records. In 2016, the album was released under Mitski's new label Dead Oceans. Critical reception Bury Me at Makeout Creek received acclaim from music critics. Writing for Pitchfork, Ian Cohen said, \\"though not necessarily nostalgic, the sound of Bury Me at Makeout Creek, the impressive third album from Mitski Miyawaki, is inventive and resourceful in a '90s-indie way,\\" concluding the review saying the album \\"still sounds like a breakthrough even if nothing's coming up Mitski in these songs.\\" Consequence of Sounds Sasha Geffen said \\"love and death and violence all smash into each other throughout the record, which delicately balances on a thin line between polished, academic pop music and unhinged punk rock,\\" adding: \\"Mitski's grip on melody, pacing, and composition is tight from years of practice, but the raw energy with which she applies it is what brings Make Out Creek to life. Her courage as a musician distinguishes her more than any amount of training. Here, it's on full display.\\" Rolling Stone Paula Mejia wrote, \\"Bury Me is edged with heavy riffs that at various times recall Black Sabbath and even Liz Phair. But it's Mitski's talent for penning deep-cutting lyrics that makes this album soar.\\" In popular culture The song \\"Francis Forever\\" was covered by Marceline the Vampire Queen in the episode \\"The Music Hole\\" from the eighth season of Adventure Time.

Despite a short and turbulent life, his work influenced the preeminent Slovenian novelist Ivan Cankar, was promoted by Rihard Jakopiƒç, the famous impressionist painter and founder of the nation‚Äôs National Gallery, and led Slovenian art into the 20th century. Bene≈°ka kuhinja/Venetian Kitchen (1888) Biography Petkov≈°ek was born in the village of Verd, near the town of Vrhnika and about 20 kilometers from the capital of Ljubljana. Jo≈æef was the youngest of 6 children, born to 68-year- old Andrej Petkov≈°ek and 20-year-old Marija Stopar. His elderly father died only three years after Jo≈æef's birth and the estate soon came under the custody of Franc Kotnik, a neighbor who would control the estate until Jo≈æef came of age. Petkov≈°ek attended local schools in Vrhnika and Idrija, and he even attended a school in Ljubljana for several years before returning home. At the age of 18 he volunteered for the Austro-Hungarian army and was sent to the occupied zone of Bosnia.Toma≈æ Brejc, Jo≈æef Petkov≈°ek, 1861-1898, Narodna Galerija, Ljubljana 1982, page 33 He served for a short time in the military and returned home, where he started painting. He visited Munich and Vienna to learn more about his craft, and in 1882, on the advice of illustrator Simon Ogrin, he visited an art academy in Venice, although he was never officially enrolled. In 1884 he went to Paris to join fellow Slovenian painter Jurij ≈†ubic, and he practiced painting at the Louvre and other museums. The following year he returned to Verd because of an eye illness, but he continued painting at home and visited Ljubljana, Trieste, and Venice in an effort to further his career. The fact that he never received a formal education in fine arts and his lack of acceptance apparently created some self-doubt; on some documents he entered ¬ªpainter?¬´ as his profession.Milƒçek Komelj, Obrazi: Slovensko slikarstvo XIX. Stoletja, Nova Revija, Ljubljana, 1999, page 194 Several of the paintings he completed during this time period, however, now belong to the National Gallery's collection in Ljubljana. In 1888 Jo≈æef met 17-year old Marija Filipesco on the street; he supposedly followed her through town and immediately proposed marriage.Toma≈æ Brejc, Jo≈æef Petkov≈°ek, 1861-1898, Narodna Galerija, Ljubljana 1982, page 34 They were married on 2 October of the same year, with Jo≈æef making his wife travel back to his hometown to show her off to a former lover who had refused to marry him.Rafael Ogrin, ¬ªSlikar Jo≈æef Petkov≈°ek, Prispevki za njegov ≈æivljenepis¬´, Kronika, 1961, page 101 They visited Naples and Sicily on their honeymoon, but they had to return earlier than expected when Jo≈æef became ill. It was around this time that Petkov≈°ek's more serious troubles with mental and physical health began. Like his father, half-brother and aunt, Petkov≈°ek had severe problems with alcohol abuse.Rafael Ogrin, ¬ªSlikar Jo≈æef Petkov≈°ek, Prispevki za njegov ≈æivljenepis¬´, Kronika, 1961, page 102 Because of debts and illness‚Äîwith both certainly exacerbated by his alcoholism‚Äîhe was forced to sell some of his possessions and property within a year of his marriage. In September 1889 the mayor of his town ordered him to be committed to an asylum after he jumped into the Ljubljanica River in a paranoid attempt to hide from the authorities. At the asylum it was reported that Petkov≈°ek suffered from melancholy and chronic alcoholism. He was to remain institutionalized until June 1890. His return home was extremely turbulent, and he seems to have ruined several of his paintings at home during fits of madness. He destroyed a painting of his wife in her wedding dress, which fellow painter Matej Sternen considered one of his finest works, sometime during this time period. He also destroyed an earlier version of one of his more famous pieces, Bene≈°ka kuhinja (Venetian Kitchen), cutting it up and re-using the canvas. To pay off some of his debts, the municipal court sold some of his possessions, but amazingly considered his paintings to be without artistic value and did not attempt to sell them. His property was also legally assigned to caretakers. He was hospitalized again from 5 January to 10 October, 1891. Because of his constant battles with mental health, his financial problems persisted; in 1892 he sold some of his paintings to settle debts, and his house was the only possession that he maintained.Toma≈æ Brejc, Jo≈æef Petkov≈°ek, 1861-1898, Narodna Galerija, Ljubljana 1982, page 36 In May 1892, he was admitted to an institution for the final time, and he spent the final 6 years of his life there.Rafael Ogrin, ¬ªSlikar Jo≈æef Petkov≈°ek, Prispevki za njegov ≈æivljenepis¬´, Kronika, 1961, page 103 He died on 22 April, 1898, officially of dementia paralytica. Legacy When Jo≈æef Petkov≈°ek passed away, not one Slovenian publication made notice of it.Toma≈æ Brejc, Jo≈æef Petkov≈°ek, 1861-1898, Narodna Galerija, Ljubljana 1982, page 37 Several of his paintings, through various auctions, had ended up in local restaurants.Rafael Ogrin, ¬ªSlikar Jo≈æef Petkov≈°ek, Prispevki za njegov ≈æivljenepis¬´, Kronika, 1961, page 104 It was not until 1908, 10 years after his death, that the renowned painter Rihard Jakopiƒç acquired much of Petkov≈°ek's work. In 1910, amidst a growing sense of Slovenian nationalism, Jakopiƒç curated an exhibit entitled ¬ª80 Years of Art in Slovenia¬´ and chose three of Petkov≈°ek's paintings to be shown. Jakopiƒç later established the National Gallery, which now houses many of the known remaining works of Petkov≈°ek. In 1914, revered Slovenian author Ivan Cankar wrote a short story inspired by the artist's work, entitled ¬ªPetkov≈°kov obraz¬´ (¬ªPetkov≈°ek's Face¬´), further enhancing the deceased artist's reputation. While recognition was belated, Petkov≈°ek is now generally accepted among Slovenia's most important artists of the late 19th century, and he is considered a forerunner of expressionist movement that followed his death. He was the first artist to paint agricultural life in Slovenia,Toma≈æ Brejc, Jo≈æef Petkov≈°ek, 1861-1898, Narodna Galerija, Ljubljana 1982, page 46 but his sometimes haunting depictions of the isolation of that bucolic life, best seen in Izplaƒçevanje koscev [1884] and Doma (Home) [1889], point to a dark modernism and existentialism for which he became posthumously famous. Art historian and professor Milƒçek Komelj wrote that Petkov≈°ek had no contemporary comparisons in the Slovenian art world, most of whom were considered realists and impressionists; in fact, Petkov≈°ek ignored the accepted norms of the academic realism of the time with his use of colors in strong contrast. Komelj also wrote that Petkov≈°ek‚Äôs Doma (Home) is the only Slovenian painting from the 19th century which later became so influential that it received the respect of the fine arts and literary communities and was the subject of artistic homage. Komelj even posited that the artist is sometimes thought of as the Slovenian van Gogh because his work directed the development of art in his country into the 20th century in terms of modernity and creativity.Milƒçek Komelj, Obrazi: Slovensko slikarstvo XIX. Stoletja, Nova Revija, Ljubljana, 1999, pages 198, 206 The first major retrospective of his work was exhibited at the National Gallery in Ljubljana in 1982, and other exhibits followed in 1999 and 2015. Work Seventeen of his paintings, both finished and unfinished, along with several studies, belong to the National Gallery's collection in Ljubljana. Notes References * Brejc, Toma≈æ.

He was suffect consul in the nundinium of September to December 124 as the colleague of Gaius Julius Gallus.Werner Eck and Andreas Pangerl, \\"Sex. Iulius Severus, cos. suff. 126, und seine Milit√§rdiplome (PA 456)\\", Zeitschrift f√ºr Papyrologie und Epigraphik, 175 (2010), p. 253 Severus is primarily known from inscriptions. Severus is attested as proconsular governor of two public provinces, both prior to his consulate. The first province was Achaea, for the term 117/118.Eck, \\"Jahres- und Provinzialfasten der senatorischen Statthalter von 69/70 bis 138/139\\", Chiron, 13 (1983), pp. 148f, 362 n. 326 The second province was Lycia et Pamphylia, for a prolonged term from 120 to 122.Eck, \\"Jahres- und Provinzialfasten\\", pp. 154-156  Speculations  Due to the lack of information about Severus, experts have attempted to identify him with the subject of less well preserved inscriptions. For example, Ronald Syme noted that an inscription from Thubursicum concerning [...]rius Severus could detail an otherwise unknown portion of his career, which lists offices that include \\"Legate of Lycia-Pamphylia, consul, legate of one of the two Germanies, proconsul of Africa .... He clearly belongs to the period from Hadrian to Marcus inclusive. A priesthood, that of sodalis Hadrianalis, standing in the praetorian posts of his cursus along with XV vir s. f..\\" However, Syme admits that the first part of his name could be restored another way, such as [Elf]rius Severus, the name of two other attested men of this period. He also admits, \\"No need to add that there are a number of unattached Severi among the suffecti of the Antonine age.\\"Syme, \\"Missing Persons (P-W VIII A)\\", Historia: Zeitschrift f√ºr Alte Geschichte, 5 (1956), p. 206 A second proposed identification is by N. Lamboglia, who restored Severus' name in a fragmentary and mutilated inscription from Albenga. This would add the office of governor of Galatia and Cappadocia to his cursus honorum. However, in his discussion of Valerius Severus, Bernard R√©my demolishes the plausibility of this restoration.R√©my, Les carri√®res s√©natoriales dans les provinces romaines d'Anatolie au Haut-Empire (31 av.

It is the fallacy of placing a proposition in the wrong modal scope, most commonly confusing the scope of what is necessarily true. A statement is considered necessarily true if and only if it is impossible for the statement to be untrue and that there is no situation that would cause the statement to be false. Some philosophers further argue that a necessarily true statement must be true in all possible worlds. In modal logic, a proposition P can be necessarily true or false (denoted \\\\Box P and \\\\Box\\\\lnot P, respectively), meaning that it is logically necessary that it is true or false; or it could be possibly true or false (denoted \\\\diamond P and \\\\diamond\\\\lnot P), meaning that it is true or false, but it is not logically necessary that it is so: its truth or falseness is contingent. The modal fallacy occurs when there is a confusion of the distinction between the two. Description In modal logic, there is an important distinction between what is logically necessary to be true and what is true but not logically necessary to be so. One common form is replacing p \\\\rightarrow q with p \\\\rightarrow \\\\Box q. In the first statement, q is true given p but is not logically necessary to be so. A common example in everyday life might be the following: # Donald Trump is the President of the United States. # The President is at least 35 years old. # Thus, Donald Trump is necessarily 35 years or older. Why is this false? The conclusion is false, since, even though Donald Trump is over 35 years old, there is no logical necessity for him to be. Even though it is certainly true in this world, a possible world can exist in which Donald Trump is not yet 35 years old. If instead of adding a stipulation of necessity, the argument just concluded that Donald Trump is 35 or older, it would be valid. Norman Swartz gave the following example of how the modal fallacy can lead one to conclude that the future is already set, regardless of one's decisions; this is based on the \\"sea battle\\" example used by Aristotle to discuss the problem of future contingents in his On Interpretation: > Two admirals, A and B, are preparing their navies for a sea battle tomorrow. > The battle will be fought until one side is victorious. But the 'laws' of > the excluded middle (no third truth-value) and of non-contradiction (not > both truth-values), mandate that one of the propositions, 'A wins' and 'B > wins', is true (always has been and ever will be) and the other is false > (always has been and ever will be). Suppose 'A wins' is today true. Then > whatever A does (or fails to do) today will make no difference; similarly, > whatever B does (or fails to do) today will make no difference: the outcome > is already settled. Or again, suppose 'A wins' is today false. Then no > matter what A does today (or fails to do), it will make no difference; > similarly, no matter what B does (or fails to do), it will make no > difference: the outcome is already settled. Thus, if propositions bear their > truth-values timelessly (or unchangingly and eternally), then planning, or > as Aristotle put it 'taking care', is illusory in its efficacy. The future > will be what it will be, irrespective of our planning, intentions, etc. Suppose that the statement \\"A wins\\" is given by A and \\"B wins\\" is given by B. It is true here that only one of the statements \\"A wins\\" or \\"B wins\\" must be true. In other words, only one of \\\\diamond A or \\\\diamond B is true. In logic syntax, this is equivalent to A \\\\lor B (either A or B is true) \\\\lnot\\\\diamond (A \\\\land B) (it is not possible that A and B are both true at the same time) The fallacy here occurs because one assumes that \\\\diamond A and \\\\diamond B implies \\\\Box A and \\\\Box B. Thus, one believes that, since one of both events is logically necessarily true, no action by either can change the outcome. Swartz also argued that the argument from free will suffers from the modal fallacy.

Before its Steam early access release on 16 October 2017, it underwent public testing through alpha and beta stages. Gameplay The player character is a robot which is able to salvage parts from the remains of other robots; the game includes over 1000 of these parts. Character development is primarily focused around equipment: parts can be gained and used to level up, but also lost. Another distinguishing feature is the in-game interface, which is considered to be user-friendly compared to other roguelikes. The game also features a destructible environment, \\"a living ecosystem\\" of robot types, and a detailed stealth system that minimises dependence on combat. Development Cogmind originated as an entry for the 2012 7 Day Roguelike Challenge, and was based on Ge's previous roguelike X@COM. After the challenge, Ge decided to develop the concept further, releasing the first public alpha in 24 May 2015; though Ge considered the alpha to be on the level of many games' release candidates. In the beginning of 2016, it was selected as one of Destructoid's top indie games to look for in 2016. Grid Sage Games released a public beta on 6 May 2017. This was followed by an early access release on Steam on 16 October. Despite this appellation, Ge stated that it was \\"a very complete experience\\", and that he only planned to withhold it from full release for around 6 months.

In: Bl√§tter f√ºr deutsche und internationale Politik 5/11. is a German political scientist. Since September 2007 he is a Professor of International Politics at the University of Vienna.  Biography  In 1989, Ulrich Brand graduated from Business Administration Studies with a specialisation in Tourism at the Berufsakademie Ravensburg with a Diploma. Between 1989 and 1996 he studied Political science (with a minor in Economics) at the Goethe University Frankfurt/Main and at the Universidad de Belgrano (Buenos Aires) as well as at the Universidad de Buenos Aires, finishing his studies also with a Diploma. In 2000, Ulrich Brand completed his PhD in Political Science at Goethe University. Between 2001 and 2007 he worked as an Assistant Professor at the University of Kassel in the Area \\"Globalisation and Politics\\". In 2006, Brand qualified with a Habilitation (venia legendi) as a University Lecturer with his thesis Die politische Form der Globalisierung. Soziale Kr√§fte und Institutionen im internationalisierten Staat (The political form of globalisation. Social forces and institutions in the internationalised state). Ulrich Brand is a member of the Board of Trustees of the \\"Institut Solidarische Moderne\\", the \\"Bundeskoordination Internationalismus (BUKO)\\" and the Scientific Advisory Board of the network \\"Attac\\" in Germany. Since 2011, he is Co-Editor of \\"Bl√§tter f√ºr deutsche und internationale Politik\\", a monthly journal on topical political and economic issues published in Germany. Ulrich Brand is also member of the \\"√ñsterreichischen Gesellschaft f√ºr Politikwissenschaft\\" (√ñGPW), \\"Deutschen Vereinigung f√ºr Politische Wissenschaft\\" (DVPW) and co-founder and member of \\"Assoziation f√ºr kritische Gesellschaftsforschung\\" (AkG). He is member of the Permanent Working Group \\"Alternatives to Development\\" that exists since 2011 and meets once a year in an Andean country. Between 2012 and 2014 he was the Head of the Department of Political Science at the University of Vienna, between 2016 and 2018 Deputy Head of the Department. Between 2011 and 2013 he was the Academic Director of the Master Study Programme \\"Interdisciplinary Latin American Studies\\". Currently, he is the Academic Director of the Master Study Programme \\"Global Political Economy of Sustainable Development\\" that starts in spring 2018. Ulrich Brand is a reviewer (among others) for: Antipode, Cambridge Journal of Economics, Environment & Planning C: Government & Policy, Environmental Politics, Environmental Values, Global Environmental Politics, Globalizations, Millennium: Journal of International Studies, Review of International Political Economy, Review of Ecological Economics, Peripherie. Zeitschrift f√ºr Politik und √ñkonomie in der Dritten Welt, Third World Quarterly, and Zeitschrift f√ºr Internationale Beziehungen.  Research  Brand's main research interests are the crisis of liberal globalisation and the internationalisation of the state, (global) social-ecological topics like resource politics and Green Economy, critical state and governance studies and Latin America. His theoretical work is part of discussions about critical state and hegemony theory (Antonio Gramsci, Nicos Poulantzas), regulation theory and political ecology. He has been working on a \\"historical-materialist policy analysis\\" (HMPA) for many years to combine different forms of policy analysis with materialist appriaches. Recently, he led a research project on trade unions and social-ecological transformation. Ulrich Brand and Markus Wissen introduced the concept of the \\"imperial mode of living\\". This concept refers to dominant patterns of production, distribution, and consumption that are deeply rooted in the everyday practices of the upper and middle classes of the global North, and increasingly in the emerging countries of the global South. The term attempts to answer the question how the specific mode of living in the Global North has caused diverse crisis phenomena but at the same time is globally attractive. In times of a ‚Äòmultiple crises‚Äô, the imperial mode of living contributes to securing social stability in the Global North. The negative consequences of the crises, especially in terms of ecology, are not noticeable yet, apart from weather extremes. At the same time, the imperial mode of living provides for a hegemonic orientation in many societies of the Global South. Beyond that, Brand and Wissen do research on the possibility of an alternative, \\"solidary\\", mode of living that has been appearing e.g. in struggles for energy democracy or food sovereignty and paves the way for a fundamental socio-ecological transformation.

It replaces the old bootloader, BootX. Compared with its predecessor, iBoot improves authentication performed in the boot chain. For macOS, the boot process starts by running code stored in secured UEFI Boot ROM (first stage). Boot ROM has two primary responsibilities: to initialize system hardware (the POST component) and to select an operating system to run (the UEFI component). For iOS, the boot process starts by running the device's Boot ROM code. In systems with S1 processors or A9 or earlier A-series processors, the Boot ROM loads the Low-Level Bootloader (LLB), which loads iBoot. In systems with newer processors, the Boot ROM loads iBoot itself. If all goes well, iBoot will then proceed to load the iOS kernel as well as the rest of the operating system. If the LLB or iBoot fails to load iOS, or fails to verify iOS, the bootloader jumps to DFU ( _D_ evice _F_ irmware _U_ pdate) mode; otherwise it loads the remaining kernel modules. On macOS, iBoot is located in \`/System/Library/CoreServices/boot.efi\`.

It was built in 1879 and belongs to Ust-Donetskoe deanery of Volgodonsk Diocese. It is also the oldest church in Ust-Donetsky District, which has been preserved to the present day. History Konygin khutor was founded in 1788 and for a long time the settlement hadn't had its own church, so its inhabitants had to go for six kilometers to Razdorskaya village ‚Äï to the Church of Our Lady of the Don. When this church became too small for both the residents of village and khutor, the farmers petitioned Don Archbishop about permission to build a new church. The permission was given, and collection of funds for its construction began, yet the Russian-Turkish war that started in 1877 interfered the plans of Kynygyn dwellers, many of whom went to war. When the Cossacks returned home the following year, a stone church was laid in honor of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin. In 1879 the church was completed and consecrated. In 1883 the church became an independent parish church, parishioners of which were residents of two khutors ‚Äï Kanyginsky and Olkhovsky. In 1889, around the church there was installed a wooden fence, and in 1914 ‚Äï an iron one. October Revolution brought harsh times to the khutor anc church. In the 1920‚Äì1930s, a bell was torn from the bell tower, the church building was boarded up, planning to turn it into a warehouse. And when, in the summer of 1962, the church in Razdorskaya village was blown up, and the explosives were also brought in Konygin for the same purposes, but the residents managed to save their church from destruction. Now the church is functioning again. In 2003 the old domes were replaced with new, gilded ones.

Gannett (July 8, 1845 ‚Äì March 22, 1895) was an essayist, poet and philanthropist, author of the poem \\"Tis Love That Makes the World Go Round\\". Early life Abbie M. Gannett was born in North Brookfield, Massachusetts, on July 8, 1845. Her girlhood was passed in that town. Her love for the country and her early associations is shown in her dainty volume of poems, The Old Farm Home (Boston, 1888). Career Abbie M. Gannett taught school a few years in Massachusetts, Michigan and St. Louis, Missouri. She was well known in the women's clubs as a reader of thoughtful essays on current themes. She tilled the Unitarian pulpit on a few occasions and served on the Maiden school board. Her essays, poems, sketches and stories had a wide publication, many of them appearing in the leading magazines and periodicals. She was deeply interested in the welfare of women and their higher education. Her paper on The Intellectuality of Women, printed in the International Review, excited wide comment. She espoused the cause of the neglected Anna Ella Carroll with enthusiasm. By a series of articles in the Boston Transcript and other papers she did as much as any one woman to bring her case to public notice. She joined the Woman's Relief Corps and attended the Grand Army of the Republic encampment in Minneapolis to advocate that lady's cause. She won recognition for her and was appointed chairman of a national relief committee to raise funds for Carroll. The effort was successful. Not content with that, Gannett visited Washington and argued Carroll's case before the military committees of both Senate and House. Personal life Abbie M. Gannett became the wife of Captain Wyllys Gannett, a nephew of the distinguished Unitarian clergyman of Boston, and himself a writer of sketches of travel and sea stories. Captain Gannett served through the Civil War in the 24th Massachusetts and the 55th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment. After living a few years in St. Louis, the Gannetts went to Boston, where they made their home for a short time. For many years they lived in Malden, Massachusetts. They had three children.

She is an American attorney and a member of the Democratic Party. Upon taking office as Acting DA in January 2015, Singas became the first Greek-American and the second woman to become the top law enforcement official of Nassau County. She was elected in November of that year and took office for a four- year term in January 2016.  District Attorney of Nassau County  Singas has served as acting Nassau DA since January 2015, assuming the role following Kathleen Rice‚Äôs election to Congress. During an interview with Bill Ritter in late 2017, referring to crimes committed by MS-13 gang members, Singas stated: \\"The crimes that we're talking about are brutal. Their weapon of choice is a machete. We end up seeing people with injuries that I've never seen before. You know, limbs hacked off. And that's what the bodies look like that we're recovering. So they're brutal. They're ruthless, and we're gonna be relentless in our attacks against them.\\" On March 27, 2018, Singas announced the establishment of the Nassau County School & Community Safety Task Force to enhance the security of schools, colleges, places of worship, and public buildings. The Task Force is chaired by Deputy Executive Assistant District Attorney for Community Relations, Joyce Smith. Among the Task Force's goals is to \\"prepare a training curriculum for educators and mental health practitioners regarding the health and safety exceptions to . . . privacy laws such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), [which] are frequently cited by medical professionals and school officials as obstacles to information-sharing regarding potential threats.\\"  Special Prosecutor  In May 2018, in the wake of allegations of sexual assault by then-Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, Governor Andrew Cuomo appointed Singas as Special Prosecutor to investigate such allegations, as well as any facts \\"suggesting that the Attorney General staff and office resources may have been used to facilitate alleged abusive liaisons.\\"  Public policy advocacy  On April 3, 2018, Singas appeared at a rally and spoke before an audience of about 200 people at Temple Beth Israel, a synagogue in Port Washington, New York, advocating in favor of what she described as common sense gun legislation. She was quoted as having said: \\"Why is legislation so difficult to get passed? I don‚Äôt know the answer to that question.\\" Singas is the defendant in a federal constitutional case, Maloney v. Singas (formerly Maloney v. Rice), in which the plaintiff is seeking a declaration that he has a constitutional right to possess nunchaku, a martial-arts weapon, in his home for peaceful martial-arts practice and home defense. In that case, through counsel, Singas has argued that nunchaku are \\"dangerous and unusual\\" weapons that may be banned totally even for such use.  Law career  Before joining the Nassau County District Attorney's Office, Singas was an Assistant District Attorney in the New York City borough of Queens. She began there in 1991, and worked in the Domestic Violence Bureau. After joining the Nassau County District Attorney's Office, she was appointed chief of the newly-created Special Victims Bureau in 2006 by Nassau County District Attorney Kathleen Rice.

Biography  = Training = The son of Ambroise-Julien Jausions, printer, Paul-Ambroise Jausions chose the coll√®ge Saint-Sauveur de Redon for his training. He then joined the parish. As a young cleric of the Archdiocese of Rennes, he was already deeply studying liturgical chant. To tell the truth, his father also knew this subject well, by printing the Principes √©l√©mentaires de musique et de plain-chant, suivis d'exemples pour faciliter l'intelligence de texte by Florent-Remi Moulin (Ambroise Jausions, Rennes, 2nd edition, 1840). It is therefore normal that the young Paul wrote a little method for the performance of the liturgical chant. Someone in his family wrote to him on November 20, 1855: \\"For plainsong, the nuns of Mercy make a special study of it, so your little method will be very useful to me.\\"p. 29, note n¬∞ 34 = Abbaye Saint-Pierre de Solesmes = Abbaye Saint-Pierre de Solesmes.

The abbot of the monastery, Dom Prosper Gu√©ranger, who wanted the restoration of the ancient and authentic liturgy, gave him his prints of the chant during the celebration of the Holy Week at the Vatican in 1856:p. 29 - 30 Paul Jausions entered his profession 29 September 1856 and was ordained a priest on 18 December 1858. = His first missions = Then in 1859 he was given the task of giving conferences on Gregorian chant and especially on the nature of the tonic accent and his role in the performance of the chant to the monks of Solesmes and the hosts of passage. In later years, therefore, Paul Jausions focused intensively on the interpretation and emphasis on Gregorian chant, in which he concentrated mainly on studies. It is likely that Dom Jausions was studying the Scriptores ecclesiastici de musica sacra potissimumhttp://data.bnf.fr/15542758/martin_gerbert_scriptores_ecclesiastici_de_musica_sacra_potissimum by Martin Gerbert, that the abbey had owned since 1844, thanks to the canon of the Le Mans Cathedral, Augustin Gontier,http://data.bnf.fr/12510144/augustin_gontier a friend of Dom Gu√©ranger and instructor of the chant of this abbey. In order that the work of Dom Jausions be actually advanced, the Abbot of Solesmes invited another monk who was able to study the ancient liturgical chant, Dom Joseph Pothier. The latter arrived at Solesmes on 1 February 1859. According to the opinion of his abbot, Dom Jausions began to copy the ancient manuscripts, around 1859.http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/ccmed_0007-9731_1996_num_39_153_2639 p. 72 What is certain is the copy made in 1860 of the English processional of St. Edith of Wilton, from the thirteenth to the fourteenth centuries, called processionnal de Rollington in the old Solesmes. He was notably instructed by Dom Gu√©ranger to prepare \\"the first draft of our monastic chant\\", realized a few years later, as Directorium chori. In this purpose, he was sent to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Le Mans to see many old song books. Through thick and thin, he succeeded in finding those that he was concerned with. The Bishop of Le Mans authorized him, in fact, to take to Solesmes a precious manuscript of the Roman gradual from Maine, provided that the duration did not exceed six months and that Dom Jausions gave him a receipt. When he was at Le Mans, he and canon Gontier were deeply discussing the topic of liturgical chant, for the first time on 23 September 1860, then from 16 October to 5 November. = Angers Library = As a result of extensive study, Dom Jausions and Dom Pothier concluded in 1862 that the oldest and lineless neumes should be consulted in order to restore Gregorian chant correctly, even nowadays, one of the principles of gregorian semiology. This is why Dom Jausions began to visit the Municipal Library of Angers regularly, performing the transcriptions of the old manuscripts, in particular those of the Maruncit 91 attributed to the 10th-century.Read online In 1862 he stayed there from 4 to 12 April, from 27 June to 9 July and from 13 to 31 October. It is not certain that in 1863 he was there, because of the preparation of the song book of his monastery. From June 3, 1864, Dom Jausions was in Angers. This time, he returned to Paris, before returning to Solesmes on July 20. Above all, he found at the Biblioth√®que nationale de France an important fac-simile of the Antiphonary of St. Benigne in double notation, copied by Th√©odore Nisard in 1851.p. 58 - 59 He was in charge of the manuscripts of Angers, again in 1865. At least the monk returned there on 6 March, 30 June and 27 October. In continuing his publication, Dom Jausions remained again at Angers, from 8 to 25 March 1866, in favor of the copy of the graduals. The city of Angers became an important place for this monk. In fact, a few books by this author were published from that city. = Directorium Chori = Dom Paul-Amboise Jausions was also the author of several books, which sometimes preferred to remain anonymous. abbey and of the city of Redon. His publications were essentially made in the mid-1860s. Thus, the Biblioth√®que nationale de France attributes the authorship of the Histoire abr√©g√©e de la Ville et de l'Abbaye de Redon, par un Pr√™tre, Ancien √©l√®ve du Coll√®ge Saint-Sauveur published in 1864 to Paul Jausions Read online. This book is considered one of the most important works of this monk. In this publication, the first major song book of Solesmes was also prepared. Thus Dom Jausions frequented his hometown Rennes as early as 1860, in view of his impression. This book entitled Directorium Chori was prepared by him under the influence of Canon Gontier, for the latter spoke considerably of this work in 1863. It was the book of singing concerning the common tones of the Masses and the Office, with the rules of accentuation and pronunciation. After several years of improvement and correction adapted to older manuscripts, the printing was done in Rennes, at Vatar in 1864. However, Dom Gu√©ranger, a contributor to the bookp. 58, note n¬∞ 76 bis: \\"Dom Gu√©ranger took part in the composition of the Directorium Chori. \\"; hesitated to distribute this book, by keeping it in Rennes. Here is a letter from canon Gontier in 1864: \\"Their\\" Directorium chori is printed, I have seen it; But it is entirely by the printer. I shall have a copy of it as soon as it is distributed to the monks. ... ¬ª. It is possible that the abbot would await the publication of the theoretical book for which the Directorium Chori would need for a more pleasant practice but, the real reason remains unknown. Around 1866, the Directorium Chori stock was completely lost, due to a fire in the Vatar printing press, with the exception of only four copies, which had previously been taken away as examples. After this dramatic event, Solesmes did not print his notations until 1883, namely the . In spite of this catastrophe, he continued his own publications. In 1866, Paul Jausions released the \\"Vie de l'Abb√© Carron\\" at Dauriol in Paris. The first impression was made in one volume, then reprinted in the same year, in two volumes. \\\\- 65 His last publication was made in favor of the restoration of the sanctuary of Glanfeuil, in 1868, entitled Saint-Maur et le sanctuaire de Glanfeuil en Anjou online. On the other hand, Dom Jausions also supported the writing of Canon Gontier, for example, the Petit trait√© de la bonne pronunciation de la langue latine (\\"Little Treatise on the Proper Pronunciation of the Latin Language\\") prepared at Solesmes and published in Paris in 1864.p. 55 : ¬´ r√®gles d'accentuation [qui] sont √† peu pr√®s uniquement de ma r√©daction ¬ª (25 April 1866) It is probable that Dom Jausions and Canon Gontier distributed their knowledge for their publications. = Gregorian travels = In 1866, the two monks were again assigned to move for Gregorian chant. While Dom Pothier remained in Alsace through Laon to seek manuscripts, Dom Jausions first stayed at the Ligug√© Abbey and the Minor Seminary of Saint-Gaultier, for a few sessions of singing. Then, after returning to Solesmes, Paul Jausions returned to the Fontgombault Abbey, not yet restored, then stayed in Paris where he copied the old manuscripts in the archives, notably at the Imperial Library. The two restorers were preparing together a book on the method of performing Gregorian chant. Their writing was said to have been completed in the summer of 1867, according to documents. However, this theoretical book, entitled M√©lodies Gr√©goriennes, was not released until 1880, after the death of Dom Jausions. According to a letter from canon Gontier, instructor of the liturgical chant of Solesmes, the latter and Dom Jausions remained cautious, judging that the theory presented in the manuscript was not yet sufficient. \\\\- 76 Hence, it is evident that the two monks concentrated henceforth on the preparation of the books of song, gradual and Antiphonary, taking advantage of their gained knowledge. Thus, Dom Jausions, being at the Municipal Library of Angers, wrote on 28 March 1867: In July, he completed the copy of this manuscript 91 of Angers, which would be presented to Dom Gu√©ranger at the feast of Assumption, after the sessions, again, in Ligug√©, Fontgombault and Saint-Gaultier. In 1868, they finished writing the gradual. Still it was necessary to prepare the antiphonary. In July, Dom Jausions went once more to Paris, in search of several manuscripts. It is sometimes said that it was the facsimile in the hand of the Antiphonary of St. Benigne, conducted by Theodore Nisard in 1851 and hosted by the Biblioth√®que Imp√©riale. Admittedly, the ' released in 1883 took advantage of it. However, it is not certain that Dom Jausions copied it in 1868.The original manuscript still remains in Montpellier, so far, without leaving this city = Towards Vincennes, last voyage = Simon Brut√© de R√©mur, first bishop of Vincennes. Dom Jausions died there in 1870, before writing the biography of his uncle. Subsequently, this monk decided to cross the Atlantic Ocean, in order to write a biography of one of his uncles, Simon Brut√© de R√©mur.Michel Crouzet, Arthur de Gobineau, cent ans apr√®s, 1882 - 1982, 1990, p. 45Mary Salesia Godecker, Simon Brut√© de R√©mur, First Bishop of Vincennes, 1931, p. 20 In 1869, he then arrived in the United-States, at Vincennes where the Bishop of Remur had founded his Episcopal Church. He suddenly died in 1870 in Vincennes before returning to France 9 September.http://data.bnf.fr/10692498/paul_jausions Dom Jausions was buried in his Solesmes Abbey, probably on 3 October.

It is protected by the central government as a National Historic Site. Overview Victorious in the Gosannen War, Fujiwara no Kiyohira relocated his seat from Iwayad≈ç Castle, in present-day Esashi Ward, ≈åsh≈´ City, Iwate prefecture, to a new location on Mount Kanzan in what is now Hiraizumi, sometime between the year 1090 to 1100 AD. There appear to be three main reasons for his choice of site. First was its location directly on the ≈åsh≈´ Kaid≈ç, the main highway leading south to the capital and other major cities and north to the lands he controlled. Secondly it was determined to be the center of his realm, as measured from the Shirakawa Barrier in the south to Sotogahama in present-day Aomori Prefecture in the north. Thirdly the location is on the south side of the Koromo River, in what had traditionally been Japanese (as opposed to Emishi) territory. The palace was used by his son Fujiwara no Motohira, grandson Fujiwara no Hidehira and great-grandson Fujiwara no Yasuhira. However, the palace was burned to the ground in 1189, when Minamoto no Yoritomo destroyed the North Fujiwara clan. The name \\"Yanagi- no-gosho\\" is not contemporary and appears to have been derived from the legend of Minamoto no Yoshitsune during the Muromachi period. In the Azuma Kagami, the palace is referred to as simply the \\"Hiraizumikan\\" (Hiraizumi residence). The site was lost for many years and there was speculation that it had been swept away by changes in the course of the Kitakami River over the centuries. However, from 1969, excavations confirmed the location and a detailed survey was conducted over six years from 1988. The palace site has a length of 725 meters and maximum width of 212 meters, and is bordered by the Kitami River to the east and the Nekomagafuchi River to the west. The two rivers are joined by moats, and the center section of the palace was protected by a wooden palisade. Excavated artifacts were abundant, and include Chinese white porcelain vases, large Tokoname ceramic pots, various wooden artifacts and earthenware dishes. The foundations of several buildings and the outlines of what was once pond in the gardens were uncovered. The area received protection as a National Historic Site in 1997, together with two sites in the city of ≈åsh≈´, Iwate; the Shirotoridate ruins and the Ch≈çjagahara temple ruins. It was included in the original 2006 nomination of \\"Hiraizumi - Cultural Landscape Associated with Pure Land Buddhist Cosmology\\". However, it was removed from the nomination after the failure to secure inscription in 2008, although there are continuing efforts to secure its inclusion through future extension. The site was opened as a park in April 2010, with many of the artifacts discovered on display at the Yanagi-no-Gosho Museum at site.

He was born at Tivetshall, Norfolk and died at Tunstead, also in Norfolk. White was educated at Bury St Edmunds Grammar School and at Jesus College, Cambridge, where he was a Rustat Scholar, taking advantage of a fund for the sons of deceased clergy. He played cricket as a middle- or lower-order batsman, though it is not known whether he was right- or left-handed. He top-scored with an unbeaten 28 for Cambridge in the match against Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) preceding the 1851 University Match against Oxford University, but failed to be picked for his Blue. The following season, despite being unsuccessful in other matches, he was picked for the University Match, where he made scores of 5 and 7 in a heavy defeat for his side, which played one man short (10 players against Oxford's 11). White graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1853; this converted to a Master of Arts in 1857. He was ordained as a deacon in the Church of England in 1855 and as a priest two years later.

It is completely identical in authority to the parallel office of medical examiner, which also exists in the state. Washington uses a \\"mixed system\\" of death investigation with some counties employing coroners, and some employing medical examiners. As of 2017, 24 of Washington's 39 counties have a coroner or a medical examiner. In 15 rural counties there are neither coroners nor medical examiners; duties normally performed by a coroner or medical examiner are instead discharged by the county's prosecuting attorney. This article uses the term \\"coroner\\" to refer to coroners, medical examiners, and county attorneys discharging the duties of coroners. History =Background and early history= The office of Coroner originated in England no later than 1194, though uncertain evidence indicates a possible older history. By the reign of Edward I, there were four coroners in each county, elected to serve for life. Coroners were charged with recording and investigating deaths, of administering treasure trove, and of substituting for the Sheriff when he was a party to a matter or incapacitated; the elected Coroner eventually evolved into a check on the power of the Crown- appointed Sheriff. The system of coronial death investigation was brought to North America by British colonists; one of the earliest coroners empowered in North America was appointed by William Penn in 1682 after a dead body was discovered on the banks of a river. A caricature of D.C. Bates, candidate for Coroner of Thurston County in the 1908 election The Washington Territory was established in 1853 and, the following year, the Territorial Legislature passed \\"An Act Relative to Coroners\\" which required each of the territory's counties to organize an election for coroner and to hold a new election every two years thereafter. This act also authorized the Coroner to perform the duties of the Sheriff in certain matters: =Efforts at reform= As early as 1907, legislative attempts were made to require elected coroners be licensed physicians. In 1913 the legislature abolished the office of coroner in all counties, except \\"counties of the first class\\" (the largest counties in the state), devolving the duties of coroner to the office of county attorney. However, A.R. Maulsby, the coroner of Snohomish County - an office which had been abolished by the statute - refused to stand-down, declaring the act of the legislature to be unconstitutional. The state's Supreme Court eventually sided with Maulsby, noting that the state constitution, as it then read, required a system of county government \\"uniform throughout the state\\". In 1948, the constitution was substantially amended to allow differential forms of county government in certain circumstances. In 1960 the Washington State Medical Association called for the complete abolition of the office of coroner, supporting its replacement with a system of state medial examiners and, in 1969, legislation was passed by the state's House of Representatives to do just that, however, the legislation failed in the state Senate. =Contemporary status= Map showing Washington counties which have coroners (blue), medical examiners (red), or neither (grey) A campaign sign in the 2018 election for Coroner of Kitsap County, Washington A staff member of the King County Medical Examiner's office moves human remains in Seattle in 2016. The Revised Code of Washington, as of 2017, provides for the creation of an office of coroner in each county with a population of 40,000 or more. In counties with a population less than 40,000, no independent office of coroner is authorized and the duties which normally fall to a corner are discharged by the county's attorney instead. In addition, counties which have a population greater than 250,000 may choose to replace the office of corner with that of medical examiner. Medical examiners are elected by the legislative authority of the county in which they hold office and are required to be certified as a forensic pathologist by the American Board of Pathology, while coroners are elected by the voters of the county in which they hold office and are required to have no qualifications other than the right to vote. In 1968, prior to the enactment of the medical examiner statute, 17 counties had coroners while the remaining 22 counties had no coroners, the county prosecuting attorney discharging the duties of coroner, instead. As of 2017 in Washington, 18 counties have coroners, six have medical examiners, and 15 have neither coroners nor medical examiners, the county attorney performs the functions otherwise discharged by a coroner or medical examiner. Duties and authority =Acting Sheriff= As of 2017, Washington law provides that a county coroner shall \\"perform the duties of the sheriff in all cases where the sheriff is interested or otherwise incapacitated from serving\\", wording unchanged from the original statute enacted by the Territorial Legislature in 1854. Entrance to the Thurston County Coroner's office in 2017 =Death investigations= In general, deaths in Washington are either certified by physicians, or by licensed funeral directors using information obtained from a physician pertaining to a decedent's cause of death. Certification is made to one of a number of regional registries each administered by a designated \\"deputy registrar\\" who approves each addition to the death registry. However, state law provides that deaths arising from one of a list of prescribed mechanisms (including drowning, hanging, electrocution, radiation, sodomy, strangulation, etc.), or involving a healthy person who had not received medical attention in the 36 hours preceding his or her death, or in which the death occurred in a jail or prison, or in which the identity of the decedent is unknown, or in which the death occurred under suspicious circumstances, can only be certified by a county coroner. Physicians, deputy registrars, or any person discovering a body (such as a police officer) are legally obligated to refer these cases directly to coroners who are authorized to take possession of the body, to order a forensic autopsy on it, to pronounce the cause and mechanism of death, and to determine if the death was the result of unlawful homicide, which is necessary to bring criminal charges against a person. In 2015, approximately 8.2 percent of all decedents in Washington were autopsied. Inquests The coroner is, additionally, empowered to convene an inquest to advise him on the cause of death prior to certifying the death. Inquests are conducted by a jury of at least four citizens convened by the coroner, hear evidence presented by him, and make an advisory verdict. The proceedings of an inquest are open to the public (investigations held outside an inquest are otherwise confidential and information produced by it - including autopsy reports - can only be released to certain individuals, such as law enforcement officers and next of kin). The procedure is rarely used, but has been invoked on occasions where a death is controversial and the coroner feels public scrutiny would be warranted. In 2016, following the shooting death of an Hispanic man by police in Franklin County, Washington, the coroner convened an inquest of six jurors - appointing three Hispanic persons to the jury - to ensure that \\"the public can‚Äôt say, ‚Äòit‚Äôs the cops investigating the cops'\\". The inquest was only the third convened in Franklin County in the preceding twenty years and ultimately ruled the death was justifiable homicide by gunshot. Prior to 2016, coroners had the authority to issue arrest warrants should an inquest determine a cause of death as unlawful homicide. Since that time, a change in state law has required coroners to refer findings of homicide to a county prosecuting attorney for charging. =Unclaimed remains= Coroners are responsible for arranging for the disposal of human remains in cases in which \\"there is no other person willing to provide for the disposition of the body\\". Related agencies, organizations, and programs =Death Investigations Account= The costs of retaining a forensic pathologist to conduct autopsies ordered by county coroners or medical examiners are reimbursed to counties by the state from the Death Investigations Account, which is held by the Washington State Treasurer. The account is funded from revenue generated by the state's Department of Health; eight dollars of the cost of every certified copy of a record produced by the department is deposited in the account. =State Patrol Toxicology Laboratory= The Washington State Patrol Toxicology Laboratory, located in Seattle, performs testing on blood and tissue for the presence of drugs and alcohol at the request of coroners and medical examiners. As of the early 2000s, it conducted approximately 650 tests per year as part of coroner or medical examiner death investigations. Established in 1963, the laboratory was accredited by the American Board of Forensic Toxicology in 2005. =Washington Association of Coroners and Medical Examiners= The Washington Association of Coroners and Medical Examiners is a non-profit, non-governmental organization composed of the state's 39 coroners, medical examiners, and prosecuting attorneys who discharge coroner duties. It facilitates the exchange of information among officials and organizes continuing education courses on topics related to death investigation. Reserve assistant coroners In 2001 Kitsap County created a program of \\"reserve investigative assistant coroners\\", what was at the time described as the first program of its kind in the state. Under it, citizen volunteers who commit to 80 hours of classroom and field training can be appointed as part-time, unpaid assistant coroners in Kitsap County. Reserve assistant coroners assist deputy coroners in transporting human remains, recovering bodies, and clerical duties. In 2002 the Kitsap County Coroner‚Äôs Office Reserve Deputy Coroner Program was disbanded. As of 2017, Lewis County had a similar program. Accreditation As of 2017, the coroner offices in Cowlitz County, Lewis County, Grant County, and Kitsap County have been accredited by the International Association of Coroners and Medical Examiners. The medical examiner offices of King County, Pierce County, Snohomish County, Spokane County, and Clark County, Washington, have been accredited by the National Association of Medical Examiners (NAME). The King County Medical Examiner‚Äôs Office first earned NAME accreditation in 1978; since then, the office has maintained accreditation, making it the longest running accredited Medical Examiner‚Äôs Office in the United States.

Map 2 (1875-1889) = Areas 581, 599 and 653 (map 2) = By executive order of March 16, 1875, some of the land ceded in 1868 turned back into the holdings of the Sioux tribe (green area 581) and also extra land east of the Missouri (the area framed with a green line). The small area east of the river adjoined an existing Yankton Sioux Reservation chiefly in South Dakota (the yellow area). Later, on August 9, 1879, some of this new, eastern land was relinquished by executive order (the yellow area framed with green). Nearly three months after the Battle of the Little Bighorn, the Sioux \\"ceded all claim\\" to about one- quarter of the Great Sioux Reservation in South Dakota in a controversial agreement. This agreement of September 9, 1876, added an extra tract to the Sioux land in North Dakota (blue area 599). It was end-to-end with a part of the northern border of what was left of the Great Sioux Reservation as well as area 581 added the year before. On November 28, still 1876, the \\"President makes another addition\\" to the Sioux land east of the Missouri by executive order. This section is only indicated by the pointed area delimited by dark blue lines. By another executive order of August 9, 1879, the very same area was restored to \\"public domain\\". A small tract of land bordering the Missouri returned into the holding of the United States by executive order of March 20, 1884 (light scarlet area 653). Area 599, added in 1876, was subtracted again on March 2, 1889, by act of Congress. (An earlier act to the same effect came not into force, \\"because of failure to obtain the consent of the Sioux\\". The new act was passed \\"with the understanding that it would be accepted. The agreement thereto was proclaimed by the President Feb. 10, 1890.\\")  Areas 529, 620 and the part of 621 south of the Missouri (map 1)  These three ranges together show the mutual Indian territory of the Arikara, Hidatsa and Mandan as defined in the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1851). It extended into Montana and Wyoming. Area 529 turned into U.S. territory on April 12, 1870, by executive order. The Fort Berthold Reservation was established at the same occasion. Further, the United States recognized a narrow tract north of the Missouri as Arikara, Hidatsa and Mandan territory (indicated by the yellow, dotted line).Meyer, Roy W, (1977): The Village Indians of the Upper Missouri. The Mandans, Hidatsas, and Arikaras. Lincoln and London. This was crucial to the Indians, since they had their only permanent settlement - Like-a-Fishhook Village - located here. Another executive order of July 13, 1880, subtracted area 620 from the tribes' holdings. = Areas 712, 713 and 716 (map 3 -below) = However, extra land straight north of the Missouri made up for some of the loss. Combined area 712 and 713 show the total expense of the Fort Berthold Reservation in 1880. Area 712 was ceded to the United States on December 14, 1886, by agreement (ratified on March 3, 1891). Area 713 shows the reduced holdings of the Arikara, Hidatsa and Mandan. The acreage of the reservation increased slightly with the addition of a small tract on the east side of it on June 17, 1892, by executive order (area 716).  Map 3  Indian territories, North Dakota.

Two years later the major part of it was relinquished by executive order of March 29, 1884. The diminished reserve for the Turtle Mountain Chippewa is shown as two yellow survey townships. Within three months, the \\"President amends Executive order of Mar. 29, 1884\\" with its far from practical division of the reserve. The executive order of June 3, 1884, made the reserve a whole (the southern half of the reserve was moved one survey township westward ‚Äì not shown on the map).

Early life Isabelle Gabriel Green was born on a farm in Gilead Township, Michigan, on February 16, 1851, the daughter of Elijah C S Green (1825-1897) and Nancy M Green (1831-1861). Her mother died when Belle was ten years old. Her education was confined to the district school. She has been from early childhood an omnivorous reader. Career At the age of eighteen Belle G. Bigelow began to teach. After eight years of quiet home life at Geneva, Nebraska, the question of the Women's suffrage amendment being brought before the people, she entered into its advocacy. Soon becoming known as a talker and writer on that subject, she was elected president of the county Equal Suffrage Association and sent as a delegate to the State convention in Omaha, Nebraska. There she made her first appearance as a public speaker and her reception encouraged a continuance of work in that line. The next winter, in Lincoln, Nebraska, she was elected to the office of State secretary and traveled over the State in the interest of the amendment, making effective speeches where opportunity offered and awakening much interest in the subject. She was twice a candidate for County Superintendent of Instruction on the prohibition ticket, in 1885 and again in 1892, but did not win either race. She represented the State in the national convention of that party held in Indianapolis in 1888. In 1894 she was nominated for Lieutenant Governor. She served for five years as secretary of the Lincoln Woman's Christian Temperance Union, being a member of the union in its infancy. She was superintendent of foreign work for the State union, and was elected delegate to the national convention in Boston in 1891. She was known as an interesting writer for the press on both religious and secular topics. Personal life On September 22, 1869 Belle G. Bigelow married George E. Bigelow (1851-1907), of Ravenna, Ohio. In 1873 they moved and settled in Geneva, Nebraska, being the first residents of that place. They had eight children, four of whom living: Maude H.

A cooked pampuch (sing.) has an oval, flat on the bottom shape, with a bouncy, mushy and soft consistency. Pampuchy or are served hot: either sweet (e.g. with jam or fruit) or savoury (e.g. with sauce or with the addition of meat). Prepared, uncooked pampuchy can be generally bought in most grocery shops in Poland. Etymology The Polish term pampuch comes from German Pfannkuchen (\\"pancake\\") which in turn derives from Pfanne (\\"pan\\") and Kuchen (\\"cake\\") similarly to English \\"pancake\\". Pampukh, a type of Ukrainian bun or doughnut, derives its name from pampuch. Regional variations =Kuyavia= The Kuyavian variation, named bu≈Çki na parze / pampuchy z Kujaw, is a protected produce under geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union. Traditionally, the dish was served on the daily Kuyavian-Pomeranian home dinner table as a main meal or snack. Generally served with sauce, as a savoury dish, or sweet with sour cream and sugar or with fruit. =Lublin Land= The following pampuchy variations are found on the Polish Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development's List of Traditional Products: *Parowa≈Ñce z kaszƒÖ jaglanƒÖ (parowa≈Ñce with millet kasza) - originated from the surroundings of the village of KƒÖkolewnica in Lublin Voivodeship. A pyzy-type dish with a light millet kasza filling. *Parowa≈Ñce brzozowickie z kapustƒÖ i grzybami (Brzozowice parowa≈Ñce with cabbage and mushrooms) - originated from the village of Brzozowica Ma≈Ça, Gmina KƒÖkolewnica. A kluski-type dish with a light wild mushroom and cabbage filling. *Parowa≈Ñce z serem (parowa≈Ñce with cheese) - originated from the village of KƒÖkolewnica, Lublin Voivodeship. A pyzy-type dish with a light white cheese filling. *Parowa≈Ñce ≈ºakowolskie z soczewicƒÖ (≈ªakowala parowa≈Ñce with lentils) - originated from the village of ≈ªakowola Poprzeczna. A light-savoury pyzy dish with a grinded lentil filling, with added fried onion. =Greater Poland= In Pozna≈Ñ Land (Pozna≈Ñ dialect: kluchy na ≈Çachu, parowce, kluchy z ≈Çacha, kluchy na lumpie) the dough is made from yeast sourdough (yeast dough with a small amount of added milk, flour, sugar and salt), which is thereafter mixed with the relevant dough ingredients (flour, eggs and milk). Margarine is added to the kneaded dough. The cooking pot is then lined with a small cloth, onto which small oval-shaped dough balls are placed upon - then covered and cooked for approximately 20 mins. Traditionally, cooked pampuchy are served with red headed cabbage and baked duck with apples. The aforesaid dish is a traditional, festive dish for Pozna≈Ñ cuisine.

Early life Caroline Brown was born in Appledore, Kent, England, on November 19, 1822, the daughter of Samuel Brown (d. 1857). The family moved to the United States in 1826. In 1850 she studied human anatomy under Rachel Brooks Gleason, M. D., at Glen Haven, New York and in December 1851 entered the Eclectic Medical College, in Cincinnati, Ohio, graduating in June 1853. She was the first woman to graduate from that college and the fifth woman in the United States to graduate with a degree in medicine. Career Caroline B. Winslow by Adelaide Johnson Caroline B. Winslow practiced successfully in Cincinnati from 1853 to 1859 and having become interested in homeopathy, graduated in 1856 from the Western College of Homeopathy in Cleveland, Ohio. She then went to Utica, New York, the home of her parents, where she remained for more than seven years. In April 1864, after the death of her parents, she went to Washington, D. C., where she served as a regular visitor in military hospitals under the auspices of the New York State Agency. After the Civil War, she spent eight months in Baltimore, Maryland, before settling in Washington where she set up a homeopathy practice. In November 1882, together with Susan Ann Edson, she opened the Homeopathic Free Dispensary, the first homeopathic pharmacy in Washington, which flourished for some years. It was the first facility where women doctors could practice side-by-side with their male colleagues. She was president for fourteen years of the Moral Education Society of Washington. She edited the Alpha, the journal of that society, for thirteen years. She was a woman-suffragist and an advocate of higher education for all. She was part of the Universal Franchise Association and together with Edson she planned the 1869 conference of the Universal Franchise Association. In 1893 sculptor Adelaide Johnson made a bust of Caroline Brown Winslow which was exhibited in the Rotunda of the Woman's Building of the World's Columbian Exposition. Personal life Susan Ann Edson 1823-1897 Caroline Brown married Austin Crosby Winslow, an artisan, on July 15, 1865, when Winslow was 43 years old. Winslow was the lifelong friend of Susan Ann Edson. They probably met at Eclectic Medical College, which both attended. During the Civil War they worked as nurses, as they were not allowed to act as doctors. After the war, Winslow and Edson moved to Washington, D.C., together and established their own practices. Together they wrote a missive to the Congress, The Right of Women to Vote. Winslow adopted her niece, Mary Brown McPherson Janney (1853-1928), after the death of her sister. Caroline B. Winslow died on December 7, 1896. Susan Ann Edson died one year later, in 1897. They are both buried at Rock Creek Cemetery, Washington.

Trade Union Hall), known as Kombank Dvorana for sponsorship reasons, is a non-residential, multi-purpose building in downtown Belgrade, the capital of Serbia. Finished in 1957, by the 1970s it became the most popular entertainment venue in the city, nicknamed the Belgrade Olympia and later was adapted into the city's first multiplex. The building was declared a cultural monument in 2013. After the 2017-2018 reconstruction and the grand re-opening on 27 April 2018, it was officially renamed to \\"Kombank Hall\\" (Kombank dvorana).  Location  Dom Sindikata in 1968 Eastern wing, view from the Deƒçanska street Dom Sindikata is located on the Nikola Pa≈°iƒá Square, in the municipality of Stari Grad. The building marks the north and north-east border of the square. A wide passage through the building marks the entrance into the Bezistan, which is the shortest pedestrian connection with Terazije, the central city square. Terazije Theatre, McDonald's restaurant and Hotel Kasina are located in the buildings which lean on Dom Sindikata in the east. In front of the building, on the square, there is a large fountain and across the square are the Historical Museum of Serbia and the House of the National Assembly of Serbia. Western fa√ßade is located along the Deƒçanska street, and north of the building is an entrance into the Terazije Tunnel.  History  = Construction = It was projected by Branko Petriƒçiƒá and the construction began in 1947. Due to the Tito‚ÄìStalin split in 1948 and the ensuing Informbiro period, the works were soon halted. The construction was resumed in 1951. Since 1953, the Soviet construction workers were employed on the site. Major works on the building were completed by 1955 while the building was fully finished by the \\"Rad\\" construction company by 1957. = Venue = The opening was held on 13 June 1957. That year the first seminar was held and the first movie show was Only people by Branko Bauer. On 18 November 1957 the first musical show was held, too. The Great Hall, with 1,600 seats, became one of the central entertainment multi-purpose venues in Belgrade (concerts, shows, cinema). Conductor stated that the hall is one of the five in Europe with the best acoustics. In the 1970s and 1980s it became a prestigious scene, Belgrade's version of Paris Olympia. Artists who performed on the stage include Olivera Katarina, ƒêorƒëe Marjanoviƒá, Arsen Dediƒá, √âdith Piaf, Miles Davis, Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, B.B. King, Duke Ellington, Oscar Peterson, Charles Aznavour, Robert De Niro, Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, but also Arthur Rubinstein, New York Philharmonic and Berlin Philharmonic. Two folk music superstars of the day, Lepa Brena and Miroslav Iliƒá, held dozens of consecutive concerts. The 1977‚Äì1978 series of matches between Boris Spassky and Viktor Korchnoi, part of the 1976-1978 world championship cycle, was held in the Dom Sindikata. The spectators were divided between two grandmasters and even fist fights occurred in front of the building. Film and music festivals which originated in the venue include FEST (from 1971 to 1977/1979 when the Sava Center was finished), \\"Kids fest\\", and \\"Belgrade Spring\\". A massive reconstruction ensued in 1978 when the interior of the entry hall was remodeled. In time it became the multiplex movie theater, with additional halls 2 (305 seats), 3 (105) and 4 (101), with the total area of . A large pipe organ was installed in 1957 and was operational until 1998. In 2017 it was estimated that the repair will cost several hundred thousands of euros. The Great Hall will remain multi-functional (concerts including symphonic orchestras, movies, and shows). Though the number of the seats will be reduced, the stage will be enlarged while the balcony and 20 loges will be kept. One of the halls will also be multi-purposed, adapted for chamber music and congresses and conferences. Large cooling equipment, today obsolete, which occupies an entire room in the basement will be surrounded by the glass walls and be accessible to the students of technical sciences. On the first floor one room at the first floors will be transformed into the city gallery and another into the children educational center. A bar will be opened in the lobby, with patio stretching outside onto the square. Inside the lobby, a panoramic elevator will be constructed. Club Promocija, which is entered from the inside passage, will be transformed into the jazz club Lisabon. The venue was re-opened on 27 April 2018 with the gala opening and was officially renamed to \\"Kombank Hall\\" (Kombank arena). The venue has been described as an \\"important institution, one of the phenomenon of the second half of the 20th century\\". A documentary film on Dom Sindikata, Witness of the time (Svedok jednog vremena), premiered in March 2019, at the 66th Belgrade Documentary and Short Film Festival. = Company = The building was originally built for the Association of the Trade Unions (SSSS), hence the name. The SSSS founded the Dvorana Doma Sindikata as a separate company, which officially managed the hall. However, that company went bankrupt in 2016 and was purchased by the movie distributor company \\"MCF - Megacom film\\" which became the official leaseholder, as SSSS is still officially the owner of the facility. In July 2017 the facility was closed for the impending complete reconstruction, projected to last up to 8 months. Due to the protected status, the overall appearance has to be preserved. The unique marble floor, banisters and handrails will be repaired and with he help of the vintage photos, the \\"old feel\\" will be kept. After the reconstruction, it will have five halls with additional venues, while the Great Hall will be reduced to 1,300 seats and will still be the largest concert hall in Belgrade.  Architecture  In winter In order to make room for the \\"contemporary works in the style of the Socialist realism\\", the new urban concept of Belgrade \\"ruthlessly demolished all obstacles\\". In order to create the new, wide plateau of the square named after Marx and Engels and effectively being transformed into a parking later, several buildings were demolished. The massive building is designed in the manner of Socialist realism, with the influences of late modernism. In terms of architecture, it is the symbol of the construction immediately after the war, and with its position and volume, it permanently set the outline of the square, which itself is one of the most important public spaces in Belgrade. Apart from architectural values, the building is important from the cultural and historical point of view, as many important political and cultural events happened in Dom Sindikata. For all that, it was declared a cultural monument in April 2013. The original request by the authorities was for a design of a massive and strong building, fully in the manner of the Social realism, which meant no ornaments on the fa√ßade. However, architect Petriƒçiƒá decided to design the new building as an extension of the building of the Retirement Fund of the National Bank of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. This building was designed by Grigorije Samojlov and was finished a couple of months prior to the outbreak of the war in 1941. The building of the Fund was ornamented with grayish-ochre stone slabs, fully designed in the Modernist style. Petriƒçiƒá used the same aesthetics and materials, embedding Dom Sindikata as a filling and a natural extension of the Samojlov's project. Though two separate buildings, in two slightly different styles and from different epochs, from a distance two buildings create an illusion of being just two wings of the same construction. The Great Hall was embellished with the painting \\"Industrialization\\". It was painted by Petar Lubarda in 1959 and has a dimensions of . It is probably the largest oil painting by Lubarda, from, as the critics described it, his best period. Public uproar was caused in October 2017 when Blic newspapers reported that painting, which they estimated up to ‚Ç¨1 million, went missing during the reconstruction. Minister for culture, Vladan Vukosavljeviƒá, and representatives of \\"Megacom\\", showed that the painting was still in the building, but was removed and protected due to the ongoing works. It was announced that it will be exhibited in the Great Hall again, after the works are finished. The process of declaring the painting a cultural property started on 5 September 2017, but it stopped at the first step as the Association of the Trade Unions, which claims the ownership, couldn't produce the proper documentation which confirms that. On 31 October 2017 the painting was officially declared a cultural property.

It was dubbed by Pontiac the Trophy 4, playing off the racing success that had earned the 389 V8 engine the nickname Trophy V-8 after just two years of competition. History The Trophy 4 engine is a short-stroke, 45-degree inclinedTrophy 4 Engine, Popular Mechanics, Dec. 1960 inline four created from the right bank of the 389 V8 for the debut of the Tempest in 1961. Its displacement is precisely half of the 389, with an identical bore and stroke of . It shared most of the 389's tooling and up to 120 of its parts. This degree of commonality enabled it to be produced on the same lines as the V8, allowing substantial cost savings. Sharing parts with the V8 caused the Trophy 4 to weigh about , exceptionally heavy for a four-cylinder. The brainchild of auto industry legend John DeLorean,What's It Worth? 1962 Pontiac Tempest \\"Trophy 4\\" Convertible ..Johnny D Decides To Put The Transmission In The Back, Vintage Auto Appraisal then the head of a design team responsible for the birth of the Tempest line, the Trophy 4 produced (gross) at 3800 rpm and at 2000 rpm with a single-barrel carburetor (as fitted with manual transmission using regular gas, and with premium); with regular gas (and with premium), as fitted with automatic transmission; and at 4800 rpm and at 2800 rpm with the optional four-barrel carburetor and automatic transmission. A \\"power pack\\" option for the 1962 four-barrel carburator increased rated power to .Pontiac '62 manufacturer's catalogue Pontiac Tempest convertible The Tempest's drivetrain featured a rear-mounted transaxle connected to the engine via a torque tube, giving the car a near-perfect 50-50 front/rear weight balance. As the driveshaft ran at engine speed, rather than the transmission output speed, it ran at a higher speed and lower torque than a conventional driveshaft for a rear wheel drive car. This allowed it to be made an unusually small solid rotating shaft, inside the pressed steel square torque tube. Uniquely, the shaft was also bent downwards into a curve, which had the effect of making the critical speed of such a flexible shaft higher than the engine's maximum rpm. The curve of this flexible, thin driveshaft earned it the nickname \\"Rope Drive\\". A downside of the Trophy 4 was engine vibration, as an inline four- cylinder engine suffers from inherent secondary imbalance resulting from its 180 degree crankshaft. The two outside cylinders move together simultaneously, as do the two inside cylinders. Due to the geometry of the wrist pins, connecting rods and crankshaft journals a piston descending from top dead center will always move quicker through the first 30 degrees of crankshaft travel than a piston moving upward from bottom dead center, meaning that more mass is moving downward than is moving upward, causing a shaking in the vertical plane. Modern engines larger than tend to have twin counter-rotating balance shafts to counteract these vibrations, but balance shafts were not commonly used until the mid-1970s. The Trophy 4 was instead cushioned by flexible rubber engine mounts designed to isolate the engine from the rest of the car, and its forces were further damped by the Tempest's unusual drivetrain that distributed these forces through the torque tube to the rear- mounted transaxle. The timing chain in the Trophy 4 was originally the same as the 389, but was prone to stretch and break from engine vibration; a special high-strength version was developed as a replacement. The Trophy 4 was dropped from the Tempest line when it was redesigned to a larger size for the 1964 model year.

Constituted in 1980, the regiment was disbanded in 1985.  History  The regiment was constituted on 3 September 1980 as the 240th Cavalry, a Combat Arms Regimental System (CARS) parent regiment in the Kentucky Army National Guard. It was partially organized on 1 November 1980 to consist of Troop A at Owensboro, part of the 149th Armored Brigade. The troop was the armored cavalry reconnaissance troop of the brigade, which was brought to full strength due to the Kentucky Army National Guard reaching its authorized strength in 1980. The troop was originally constituted on 13 May 1946 as the Headquarters, Headquarters and Service Company of the 201st Engineer Combat Battalion in the Kentucky National Guard, and organized and Federally recognized on 24 August 1949 at Owensboro. It was ordered into active Federal service on 1 May 1951 during the Korean War but did not go overseas. The battalion became the 201st Engineer Battalion on 8 June 1953 and the company was released from active duty and reverted to state control on 30 March 1955. On 1 October 1959, it was redesignated as the Headquarters and Headquarters Company of the 123rd Armor's 2nd Medium Tank Battalion. Company A, 240th Tank Battalion was among the Owensboro units consolidated to form the HHC of the battalion. The company was ordered into active Federal service on 15 October 1961 during the Berlin Crisis to replace units that had been deployed to Germany at Fort Stewart. After tensions lowered, the company was released from active service and reverted to state control on 11 August 1962. On 6 April 1964, the battalion became the 2nd Battalion, 123rd Armor. Between April 1982 and August 1983, the troop was commanded by Captain Norman E. Arflack, later assistant adjutant general of the Kentucky Army National Guard. Troop A was redesignated as Company D, 2nd Battalion, 123rd Armor on 1 November 1985 during a reorganization of the Kentucky Army National Guard. This came as a result of the 149th Armored Brigade losing its status as a separate brigade upon joining the reactivated 35th Infantry Division (Mechanized); the 35th's reconnaissance capability was provided by Nebraska's 1st Squadron, 167th Cavalry.

The first Unit Commander was Captain Edward G. Stanford. During this time, there were three types of Aerial Delivery companies; Aerial Supply, Parachute Maintenance, and Air Equipment Repair. The 601st Quartermaster Aerial Supply Company's mission was to train and execute heavy airdrop missions and conduct re-supply operations from airdrop platforms or containers, by lashing them to the inside of the aircraft and properly ejecting them over the drop zone. This type of unit was designed to provide continued air supply to troops cut off from ground re-supply. The 601st supported re-supply operations during the Korean War. With the war in Korea, \\"logistic by parachute\\" became an established part of supporting combat operations. The poor weather, lack of road and rail networks and the brutal terrain created huge obstacles to ground resupply missions. Korea marked the first large scale use of aerial resupply, heavy drop and the standardization of airdrop procedures and units. During this war the C-54, C-119 and the C-47 cargo planes were used for air drops supported by the 601st.https://www.qmfound.com/article/short-history-of-quartermaster- aerial-delivery/http://old.qmfound.com/rigger_units.htm Upon the deactivation of the 11th Airborne Division in 1958, the 601st Quartermaster Aerial Supply Company ceased support operations until 6 October 2016, as it re-activates to support the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team.

Formerly the front-man of Two Hours Traffic, he is now an established solo artist.  Career  = Two Hours Traffic = Two Hours Traffic was a Canadian indie rock band active from 2000 to 2013. Hailing from Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, the group were performers of power-pop songs. Core members included Liam Corcoran (lead vocals, guitar), Alec O‚ÄôHanley (lead guitar, vocals, keyboards), Andrew MacDonald (bass, lead guitar), and Derek Ellis (drums), with Nathan Gill (bass) replacing O‚ÄôHanley in 2011. Their fourth album, Little Jabs, was short- listed for the Polaris Music Prize. The band held a farewell tour before disbanding in 2013. Since then, the group has reunited occasionally. Each of the band members has since moved on to other musical projects: Corcoran pursues a solo career and plays with The Express; O‚ÄôHanley is part of Alvvays; Gill is part of North Lakes and Baby God; and MacDonald and Ellis are part of Golden Cinema. = The Express = The Express is a side project of cousins Liam Corcoran and former Hey Rosetta! member Kinley Dowling. Beginning in 2010, the duo began as an outlet for the artists to explore their songwriting. During this time, Corcoran developed a different compositional voice while Dowling started songwriting. The group is described as both folk and pop, with their debut self-titled album being heavily acoustic„Éº Dowling wrote three tracks while Corcoran wrote the rest. The album explores transitions, honesty, youth, new relationships, and experiences, while Corcoran's acoustic guitar and Dowling's violin and viola (even plucked like a mandolin in her track \\"Sharpshooter\\") serve as bedrocks. Cuff the Duke member Dale Murray is featured much in this work, not only producing (with \\"spontaneity over rigid structure\\"), but also playing frequently. He is sometimes cited as a core member of the Express in his own right. The self-titled album was described by the Graypoint Owl as \\"one part Two Hours Traffic catchiness, one part Hey Rosetta! sensitivity and one part Cuff the Duke earthiness\\", receiving the rating of \\"Proud Hoot (Really Good) + *swoop*\\". After this release, the Express went on hiatus as Corcoran and Dowling established their solo careers, but as of February 2020 the group has reconnected and performed. = Solo career = Following his ensemble experiences with Two Hours Traffic and The Express, Corcoran has developed his career as a solo artist. Although his material continues to exhibit the catchiness of pop, it has grown in other different directions. His debut EP Rom-Drom can be neatly categorized as alt- country, but Nevahland, his first LP, is a stylistically-complex blend of rock, pop, indie, hip-hop, and alt-country. In March 2020, Corcoran released his latest album, Giving Tree and Other Songs „Éº an album split into two parts: simple acoustic songs and more elaborately-orchestrated songs, each with their own flavour including punk, rock, alt-country, lo-fi, and indie-pop. His first two releases also feature extra-musical themes: Rom-Drom explores separation from a distance, and Nevahland tells the story of three couples fleeing an oncoming disaster.  Personal life  Liam Corcoran works as the Program Manager for Holland College‚Äôs School of Performing Arts (SOPA). He has also worked in other branches of education, notably co-writing a song with students from Prince Street Elementary School. In recent years, Corcoran has become a father and husband; this is encapsulated in his album Giving Tree and Other Songs which reflects ideas of domesticity and fatherhood. Corcoran is a cousin of songwriter and former Hey Rosetta! member Kinley Dowling.

Rapace's character is based on that of Jacquie Davis, one of the world's leading female bodyguards, whose clients have included J. K. Rowling, Nicole Kidman and members of the British royal family. \\\\- The film was released on 18 January 2019 by Netflix. Plot While in South Sudan on a routine mission, close protection officer Sam Carlson saves two journalists she is protecting when their vehicle is attacked by local insurgents. Zoe Tanner, the troubled child and heir of recently deceased business tycoon Eric Tanner, discovers she has been left all of her father's shares in his company, Hassine Mining. This shocks and angers her stepmother, Rima Hassine, whose family founded the company and who has taken over Eric's position as CEO. Having succeeded in negotiating a billion dollar deal for phosphate mining in Zambia, Rima demands that Zoe accompany her to the family house in Morocco while she completes the deal. Rima hires Sam to act as Zoe's bodyguard for the trip, as her previous male bodyguard was fired for having sex with Zoe. Upon arriving at the family's fortified kasbah, Zoe demands that Sam remain for the full time she has been paid, and stay the night. Later that evening the safehouse's security system is breached, locking the property down and trapping its inhabitants. The intruders kill multiple members of the security team. The heavily armed intruders make their way to Zoe's room, killing en route the head of security, Alik. Zoe escapes with Sam, and they are picked up by responding police officers. Although the officers assure them they are being taken to a police station, Zoe (who speaks Arabic) overhears them discussing a private address and money. Sam fights and disarms the officers, but Zoe ends up shooting one of them with Sam's sidearm. The two escape on foot into Casablanca and take refuge in a hotel. News of the incident causes share prices in Hassine Mining to drop considerably, potentially enabling their competitor Sikong to steal the deal. Sam promises to get Zoe out of the country and is later joined by her boss Conall. Their escape plan is for the three of them to travel as a family to Tangier and take the ferry to Spain. They are ambushed at the hotel by men who kill Conall. Sam saves Zoe from being taken by brutally fighting and killing two of the men. Unable to leave the country without passports, Sam and Zoe travel to Hassine Mining headquarters to meet Rima. There they witness her in the car park with one of the suspicious men from the hotel. They follow him to a local marina, but Sam is noticed and the two fight; Sam impales him with a large fishing hook. Looking through his wallet, Sam and Zoe discover he is a police officer and had Rima's login details for the house security system. While meeting with the selling company, Rima is confronted by a member of the competitor Sikong, who makes further threats on Zoe. Sam and Zoe return to the abandoned safehouse, where Zoe discovers that Sam previously had a child whom she put up for adoption at 16. During a meeting to finalize the mining deal, Rima receives a notification that her phone has been accessed by the house security system, and she leaves without signing the mining deal. The house is surrounded by corrupt members of the police, who refuse to allow a detective from Casablanca working with Rima to enter. Rima arrives by helicopter. She reveals to Zoe that she is being blackmailed and that she is not responsible for the attempts on her life. She is attacked by the mercenaries and corrupt officers, although Zoe and Sam intervene and eventually save her. Sam is wounded in the wrist. With Zoe and Rima safe, and the threat over, Sam leaves to head home but promises Zoe she will call her daughter.

Early life Delia Krum was born in Franklin, Delaware County, New York, on November 25, 1830. Her mother died when she was a young woman, and her father soon afterward moved to Michigan. At the age of fourteen years Krum entered the State Normal School in Albany, New York, and was graduated after the usual course. Career Collins's husband founded a large business. His excessive labors brought on nervous paralysis, from which he never recovered. Collins, in the pressure of home matters, the continued and hopeless illness of her husband, opened a select school for young women, and taught French and German and English literature. Her influence among the literary societies of the city was extensive. In 1884 Collins became interested in Bible study, Woman's Christian Temperance Union work, church and city charity, and did much in those lines. Her health became impaired, and, becoming acquainted with Carrie Judd Montgomery, of Buffalo, New York, known as the publisher of Triumphs of Faith, she accepted the doctrine of Divine Healing and was healed of a long-standing spinal trouble. She moved to Fort Worth, Texas, with her sons in 1888. In connection with Woman's Christian Temperance Union work, she, with Kate Belle Murray Burchill, of Fort Worth, opened a bootblack's home, which finally resulted in the founding of an orphanage. A building was given for their work, and the home contained nearly seventy children. She also assisted in opening the Union Bethel Mission of Fort Worth. Its purpose was to reach the people on the street and the children. Mission Sunday-schools were founded and carried on, also nightly gospel meetings and tent gospel meetings. Her next work was the opening and founding, with other women, of a woman's home, a home for unfortunate women on the streets. She was engaged in the winter of 1891‚Äì1892 in delivering lectures throughout Texas in behalf of the home. She had the charge of the State social purity department work of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, and was also the president of the Woman's Board of Foreign Missionary Work of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church, North Texas. Personal life and family In 1846 Delia Krum accepted the assistant principalship of a school in Geneseo, New York, associated with Henry W. Collins (1825-1876) as principal. He was a graduate of the State Normal School. They were married in Franklinton in 1849. They moved to Elmira, New York, and Henry Collins was largely instrumental in the surveying and laying out of that city. In 1855 they moved to Janesville, Wisconsin. Henry Collins was elected superintendent of the city schools for several terms, and was connected with the founding and building up of the Institute for the Blind in Janesville. He was the first president and one of the founders of the Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company, of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In 1865 he became an invalid, and was confined to the house for eleven years. It was at that time the public life of Delia Collins began. The Collins had two sons and a daughter. Henry Collins died in 1876. She died in 1896, in Fort Worth, Texas, and is buried at Oak Hill Cemetery, Janesville.

His compositions have won him the Guggenheim Fellowship, the Barlow Prize, and the Alexander Zemlinsky International Composition Competition Prize. He is the founder of Thailand International Composition Festival (TICF). Currently, he serves as Dean of the College of Music, Mahidol University in Thailand, as well as composer-in-residence for Thailand Philharmonic Orchestra and Pacific Symphony in Orange County, California. His scores for orchestra and wind ensemble are published exclusively by Theodore Presser Company. Biography =Early life= Narong Prangcharoen is originally from the Uttaradit province in northern Thailand.Chucherdwatanasak, Nathinee. \\"Narong Prangcharoen and Thai Cross-Cultural Fusion in Contemporary Composition.\\" Master's thesis, University of Missouri-Kansas City, 2014. His first experience with classical music took place during the secondary education at Horwang School in Bangkok, where he became a member of the school's wind ensemble playing trumpet. In 1991, he became a music education major at Srinakharinwirot University in 1991. He took some music theory classes with Kit Young, an American composer and pianist who exposed Prangcharoen for the first time to 20th-century music. During his junior year, Prangcharoen turned his focus to piano when he went to Kit Young's piano recital and was fascinated by sonic variety of her contemporary repertoire. He started taking piano lessons with Young and within a year, passed the grade 6 piano examination of the International Examinations Board, Trinity College London. He then became a piano instructor at Chintakarn Music Institute where he met another American pianist, Bennett Lerner, who was the Head of the Piano Department of the Institute and later became Prangcharoen's piano instructor.\\"Bennett Lerner.\\" Music by My Friends. Albany Records TROY 695-96. CD. 2004. Liner notes. Under Lerner's instruction, he achieved a Certificate Examination for solo piano from the Guildhall examinations board. =Musical Education= Boredom and stress from piano playing triggered Prangcharoen's musical move in 1998. Kit Young suggested him to try composition as an alternative to cope with musical fatigue and introduced him to Narongrit Dhamabutra, a composition professor at Chulalongkorn University. After two years, Prangcharoen pursued a master's program at Illinois State University (ISU) in August 2000. At ISU, he took composition lessons primarily with Stephen Andrew Taylor, who introduced him to post-war serialism and American popular music. But most importantly, Taylor instructed him how to organize effective pitch and rhythmic materials, abilities that became Prangcharoen's most significant compositional tools in setting up and developing his compositional style. In 2002, Prangcharoen attended the Conservatory of Music and Dance at the University of Missouri- Kansas City (UMKC) for a doctoral degree in music composition. His primary composition professor was Chen Yi, who had a great influence on his cross- cultural compositional style. =Career= After receiving the Doctor of Musical Arts (D.M.A.) from UMKC in 2010, he worked as a freelance composer and taught composition and piano at the Community Music and Dance Academy of the UMKC Conservatory of Music and Dance. In 2013, Prangcharoen received the Guggenheim Award, the Barlow Prize, and a three-year composer residency with the Pacific Symphony. Besides the United States, Prangcharoen has been active in the Asian continent. He has been a guest composer at the Beijing Modern Music Festival in China. In Thailand, he founded the Thailand International Composition Festival (TICF), an annual weeklong summer music festival which had its thirteenth anniversary in 2017, with a purpose to promote the contemporary classical music's scene of Thailand and other Southeast Asian countries. Compositions Prangcharoen's music is known for its captivating melodies, effervescent rhythms, brilliant orchestrations, ethereal qualities, and cross-cultural backgrounds. His programmatic Phenomenon for orchestra (2004), in particular, has been praised for its \\"eventful\\" and \\"thrilling\\" \\"sonic tour de force\\" and \\"vivid and memorable pictorial setting.\\" Besides Phenomenon, Prangcharoen's most distinguished works include Mantras for soprano saxophone and wind symphony, Whispering for soprano saxophone, bass clarinet, piano, and percussion (2008), and Three Minds for solo piano (2003).

The current building replaced an earlier medieval court. The house played a role in the English Civil War when it was seized by the forces of Thomas Fairfax during the siege of Raglan Castle. In the 18th century the estate was sold to Valentine Morris, owner of nearby Piercefield House. In the 19th century the court was owned by the Fluyders, but let to tenant farmers. It remains a private house and working estate. The court is a Grade II* listed building. History The current house dates from the 1580s, and was built by a John David Powell, to replace the earlier, medieval manor house which stood on the site. At some point the Powells took the name of Jones and a descendant, Jane Jones, married Charles Hughes of Moynes Court, near Chepstow. Charles Hughes was a prominent Cavalier and Trostrey was taken by General Thomas Fairfax during the siege of Raglan Castle in 1646. In the mid-18th century, the estate was sold to Valentine Morris, a sugar planter who lived at the, much grander, Piercefield House. Morris held the court for only a short time before debts forced him to mortgage it to Sir Samuel Fludyer in the 1770s. The Fluyders owned the court for the next one hundred years but never lived there, letting it to tenant farmers. In the 20th century, the court was bought by the Morgans, and, still run as a working farm and private estate, is owned by their descendants. The current owner, David Morgan MBE is the president of the Usk Rural Life Museum. Architecture and description The current house replaced an earlier manor. The house is constructed to a T-plan, and is built of rubble with slate roofs. The three-storey porch dates from the early 17th century and is described by the architectural historian John Newman as \\"most remarkable\\". The building is of two-storeys, with attics. The exterior of the house has been rendered and repointed and the windows replaced in the late 20th century. Newman considers the result, \\"none too attractive\\". The interior contains significant 17th century wood panelling, including in the interior of the porch. In the 18th century wing of the court, a bedroom chamber is reported to house a priest hole behind the fireplace. The court is a Grade II* listed building, the Cadw designation noting its \\"important and early history...(and its)...fine panelling\\".

It is now displayed in the Adƒ±yaman Archaeological Museum.  Discovery  The votive relief was discovered in the vast necropolis of the city of Perrhe - today the suburb of Pirin in the provincial capital of Adiyaman. During excavation and cleaning work by the Museum of Adiyaman in 2001 under the leadership of its Director, Fehmi Erarslan, the relief was revealed in secondary use as the covering for a late antique grave. Along with Samosata, Marasch and Doliche, Perrhe was one of the core cities of the Kingdom of Commagene. Thus, the relief of Jupiter Dolichenus is the only one thus far known, which has been found in the immiediate area of the god's original worship. While images of him spread throughout the whole Roman empire and numerous examples have been found in Western Europe, they are rare in Asia Minor and Syria. As part of a project of the Forstellungstelle Asia Minor of the University of M√ºnster, the relief was discussed by Michael Bl√∂mer (relief) and Margherita Facella (inscription).  Depiction  The stele is made of light yellow local limestone and measures 0.81 m high and 0.63 m wide. The base is 11 cm deep, the greatest projection of the relief is 12 cm. At left is the god and at right, under his arm is an eight-line inscription. A large part of the relief is lost, including the point of the god's hat and both hands, while of the legs only the upper thighs survive. This bottom break runs through the final line of the inscription. The relief is very deep, such that parts of the figure like the head and the arms are nearly in the round. The god is shown in a typical pose of Jupiter Dolichenus, with his right arm raised and his left arm bent. There was a thunderbolt held in his left hand, but only the lower part still survives. The labrys usually found in the right hand is completely lost. Jupiter is depicted with a beard and long hair, both of which are depicted in detail with individual spiral locks. Despite the serious damage to the face, the deep-set eyes with drilled pupils can still be made out. On top of his head, he wears a Phrygian cap. Otherwise he is dressed in a military outfit. On his upper body, he wears a Roman muscle cuirass over his tunic, which is held in place by flat leather straps over his shoulders and a Cingulum militare around his midriff. Over his hips he wears the Pteruges, with deep furrows in between them. Over his cuirass the god wears a paludamentum, which is gathered over his right shoulder and hangs down from his left shoulder such that it is visible in the background behind him. A small bandolier holds a sword on his right hand side. The god wears tights on his legs. Above the right shoulder of the figure, behind the raised arm, the remains of an eagle are visible. The end of the left wing and the tail feathers are relatively clear. The relief may have been complete with the common, right-facing bull, on which the god would have stood, as is common in the iconography of images of Jupiter Dolichenus. The tights the god wears are remarkable, as is the head covering. Both were considered \\"oriental\\" attributes by the Romans and thus emphasised his supposed birthplace. In other images from northern Syria and Asia Minor, there are no other cases of the god depicted wearing tights, although they were subsequently an attribute of the god, especially in Roman depictions.  Inscription  The dedicatory inscription is in the right, lower floor of the field, between the left leg and the left arm. It is eight lines long, with letters deeply carved into the stone. The letters get smaller lower down, which indicates that the stonemason had issues fitting the text in the available space. The inscription says: :ŒìŒ¨œäŒøœÇ ·æøŒôŒøœçŒªŒπŒøœÇ Œ†Œ±·ø¶ŒªŒøœÇ œÑ·Ω∏ŒΩ Œ∏·Ω≤ŒøŒΩ ŒîŒøŒªŒØœáŒµŒøœÇ œÉœÑœÅŒ±œÑŒπœéœÑŒ∑œÇ ·ºÄŒΩŒ≠Œ∏Œ∑Œ∫ŒµŒΩ œá[œÅ]Œ∑ŒºŒ±œÑŒπœÉŒ∏ŒµŒØœÇ :Gaius Iulius Paulus, soldier, dedicated [this] to the god of Doliche, after receiving an oracular response. Thus the inscription supplies the name of the dedicant, his position, and the reason for his dedication. The donor from Doliche was a soldier and his name indicates that he was a Roman citizen. Bl√∂mer and Facella suggest that one of his ancestors received citizenship and adopted the nomen Julius. This nomen was widespread in North Syria and Commagene and indicates either the emperor who was reigning at the time of the receipt of citizenship or the governor of the province who was responsible for the award. It is not stated which legion of the army that Gaius Julius Paulus belonged to. It is known that towards the end of the 2nd century AD, soldiers of the Legio IV Scythica were carrying out construction work in Commagene and that, around the same time, the Legio XVI Flavia Firma was tasked with the construction of the Chabinas bridge. But whether Paulus came to Perrhe as a member of one of these legiones or belonged to another vexillatio stationed in the area, cannot be determined. This is particularly the case because the original location of the stele is unclear. The letterforms indicate that the inscription dates to the period between the late 2nd century AD and the beginning of the 3rd century AD.

Apple Center for Vision Research which includes the David J. Apple International Laboratory for Ocular Pathology. Background Gerd Auffarth was born in Delmenhorst near Bremen, North Germany, the fourth child of Arthur and Emma Auffarth. He grew up in Delmenhorst and in Remscheid near Cologne. Career Auffarth graduated from Medical School Aachen, Aachen University of Technology (RWTH Aachen), Germany in 1990. Prior to pursuing a career in research and training in ophthalmology, as a fourth year medical student in 1988, he was awarded an Albert Schweitzer Fellowship¬Æ to spend three months at the Albert Schweitzer Hospital in Lambar√©n√©, Gabon. There he worked as a junior physician in medicine rotations,(tropical medicine, paediatrics), supervised by hospital medical staff. In 1989 Auffarth published an account (written in German) and illustrated with photographs of his time at the hospital. In 1992, he was recipient of a Max Kade postdoctoral research grant (Max Kade Foundation, New York, NY, US) and became a research fellow of David J Apple at his Center for Intraocular Lens Research, Storm Eye Institute, Department of Ophthalmology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA. Auffarth worked with Prof. Apple between August 1992 and September 1994 in the laboratory that Apple later renamed as David J. Apple International Laboratory for Ocular Pathology. Returning to Germany, Auffarth continued his research with a project in ‚ÄúGenetic degenerative retinal diseases‚Äú funded by the German Research Council (DFG) at the Heidelberg University Eye Clinic; he completed his Residency and board certification in Ophthalmology in Heidelberg in December 1996; and was awarded the title of Privatdozent and Venia Legendi for Ophthalmology in 1999. In 2004 he was appointed vice chairman and deputy director of the Heidelberg Department of Ophthalmology; he was awarded Extraordinary professorship in the Medical Faculty of the University of Heidelberg in May 2005; and appointed as Chairman of the Department of Ophthalmology in April 2011 (having been acting chairman since March 2009). North Korea In 2006, Auffarth was permitted to visit North Korea and he reported on his visit in a video entitled, Ophthalmology Behind the Iron Curtain: Cataract Surgery in North Korea- the video was released in 2011. He is one of the few Western surgeons to have carried out eye surgery in North Korea. Before he arrived in Pyongyang, he was authorized to do just five surgeries but once he reached the University Hospital he found that he could do seventeen: one perforating keratoplasty using donor tissue he had brought from Germany, three scleral-fixated secondary IOL implantations, and thirteen phacoemulsification procedures with IOL implants. All the procedures were conducted with topical anaesthesia which had been brought from Germany. He reported on his experiences, saying that the economic conditions have led to improvisations - especially because of the absence of consumable medical devices - but he commented that once a visiting surgeon adapts to these unique surroundings, he found that teaching and clinical work could be very effective and satisfying for both surgeon and patient. As a consequence of this visit, in 2007 two young North Korean ophthalmic surgeons were permitted to visit Heidelberg and remain for six months, gaining extensive training in eye surgery. The DGII Society Gerd Auffarth became Secretary of the Deutschsprachige Gesellschaft f√ºr Intraokularlinsen-Implantation, interventionelle und refraktive Chirurgie (DGII) (the German-speaking Society of Intraocular Lens Implantation, Interventional and Refractive Surgery) from 2002 to 2010; and the Society's President from March 2012 to February 2016. and Vice President in 2017. In 2018, he was appointed as the General Secretary of the DGII. Recognition, Honours and awards Auffarth is a Fellow of the European Board of Ophthalmology (FEBO). In April 2018, the Ophthalmologist online magazine published its 2018 Powerlist of the World's Top 100 most influential people in the world of ophthalmology. The list includes surgeons, scientists, engineers and CEOs in the ophthalmic device and pharmaceutical industries. Dr. Donald Tang from Singapore was voted number 1 by the magazine's readership.

Sherwin (1962 ‚Äì 18 July 2017) was an English veterinary scientist and senior research fellow at the University of Bristol Veterinary School in Lower Langford, Somerset. He specialised in applied ethology, the study of the behaviour of animals in the context of their interactions with humans, and of how to balance the animals' needs with the demands placed on them by humans. Sherwin became known for his work on the welfare of animals in zoos, farms and laboratories, and in particular for his research into the behaviour of laboratory mice. He created and chaired the Animal Ethics Committee of the International Society for Applied Ethology, and in 2003 was the lead author of its ethical guidelines. He also served as secretary of the Ethical Committee of the Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. A colleague at Bristol described Sherwin as a \\"stalwart advocate for animals and their welfare\\". In 2019 the RSPCA posthumously awarded Sherwin a Special Recognition Award: according to the Head of the RSPCA's Research Animals Department, \\"Chris Sherwin‚Äôs work influenced and assisted all of the RSPCA science departments, which deal with wildlife, research, companion and farmed animals\\". Early life and education Sherwin was born in Bradford, England, and spent several years in Australia, where he earned his BSc in veterinary biology from Murdoch University in Perth. In 1987 he obtained his PhD, also from Murdoch University, for a thesis entitled Shading behaviour in sheep: The influence of social and thermal factors.\\"Shading behaviour in sheep: The influence of social and thermal factors\\", National Library of Australia. Career =Research overview= Sherwin became a junior research fellow at the University of New England in Armidale, New South Wales, where he wrote about electronic tags and ear damage in pigs before returning to England in 1990. That year he joined the Animal Welfare and Behaviour group at the University of Bristol Veterinary School to work on enriched housing for laying hens. Sherwin worked at Bristol until he retired in 2012. During his two decades there, he became known for his research into improving the housing and husbandry of captive animals, and for his work on developing ethical guidelines for animal use. He studied poultry in commercial facilities, mice in laboratories, elephants in zoos, insect consciousness, and the use of video to record farm animals' behaviour.Friend, Ted (2005). \\"Book reviews\\", Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 43(4), July 1995, p. 304.Sherwin, Chris (2012) [1993]. \\"Farm Animals\\", in Stephen D. Wratten (ed.). Video Techniques in Animal Ecology and Behaviour. Springer Science & Business Media, pp. 125‚Äì144. =Poultry and laboratory birds= Sherwin's studies included examining the behaviour of birds on farms and in laboratories. He wrote about housing for poultry used in meat and egg production. Between 1998 and 2001 he published 11 papers on turkeys, which included examining the effect of lighting on their welfare; his research suggested that turkeys prefer brighter lights than those in commercial facilities.\\"Light and behaviour\\", in D. S. Mills, Jeremy N. Marchant-Forde (eds.) (2010). The Encyclopedia of Applied Animal Behaviour and Welfare. Wallingford: CABI, p. 387. In the early 2000s, he was a member of the European Council's Working Group for Birds, which wrote provisions for birds for the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals used for Experimental and Other Scientific Purposes.Hawkins, Penny, et al. (19 February 2003). \\"Future principles for housing and care of laboratory birds\\", Working Party for the Preparation of the Fourth Multilateral Consultation of Parties to the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals used for Experimental and Other Scientific Purposes (ETS 123)\\", Strasbourg: Council of Europe. In a study for the RSPCA's \\"Freedom Food\\" label in 2009, he led a team from Bristol University that investigated stocking densities of hens used for eggs.\\"British Free Range Egg Producers Association to help fund trials on stocking density\\" , Ranger, 8 June 2009. In 2010, Sherwin found a high incidence of broken bones in hens housed in a type of cage that was banned in the European Union soon afterwards.Nicol, Christine J. (2015). The Behavioural Biology of Chickens. Wallingford: CABI, p. 164. =Elephants in zoos= From 2005 to 2007 Sherwin was part of a team funded by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), the RSPCA, BIAZA, and IFAW to write a report concerning captive elephants: The Welfare, Housing and Husbandry of Elephants in UK Zoos (2008), about the 77 elephants then kept in 13 British zoos.Harris, Moira; Sherwin, Chris; Harris, Stephen (10 November 2008). The Welfare, Housing and Husbandry of Elephants in UK Zoos: Final Report. University of Bristol.\\"The Husbandry of Elephants in UK Zoos\\", Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).\\"Elephants in UK Zoos\\", Zoos Forum, 7 July 2010. Sherwin told the BBC that almost half the elephants engaged in behaviour not seen in the wild, such as pacing, retracing their steps, and repeatedly swaying their trunks, which \\"almost certainly indicates they're in an environment which is inappropriate for their needs\\". According to the report, 38 percent of the elephants the team examined performed these stereotypies for over one percent of the time during the day, and nearly half did so at night; during one 24-hour period, one elephant stereotyped over 60 percent of the time.Harris, Sherwin and Harris 2008, p. 42. In Sherwin's view, elephants could be kept in zoos with the correct housing and care, but not in the numbers seen at that time.\\"Elephants 'die earlier in zoos'\\", BBC News, 11 December 2008. =Invertebrate pain= Another of Sherwin's research interests was the complexity of invertebrate behaviour and their capacity to suffer pain. He told Discovery News in 2009 that whether invertebrates experience pain was \\"fundamental\\" to the laws that protect animals and regulate their use.Viegas, Jennifer (27 March 2009). \\"Lobsters and crabs feel pain, according to study\\", NBC News. Mike Mendl, a colleague of Sherwin's, wrote that Sherwin anticipated the interest in insect emotion and consciousness by over a decade. According to Jonathan Balcombe, Sherwin challenged the traditional view of the insect as a \\"spineless, pre-programmed automaton\\".Balcombe, Jonathan (2006). Pleasurable Kingdom: Animals and the Nature of Feeling Good. New York: St. Martin's Press, p. 193. Sherwin reasoned that insects had preferences, habits, and memories, and could experience suffering as a \\"negative mental state\\". That insects have different nervous systems and might perceive pain differently from vertebrates does not mean they lack consciousness. When deciding whether an animal can suffer, he wrote in 2001, we compare its responses to those of evolutionarily higher animals, an argument by analogy, and find that invertebrates \\"often behave in a strikingly analogous manner to vertebrates\\".Tiffin, Helen (June 2016). \\"Do Insects Feel Pain?\\", Animal Studies Journal, 5(1), (pp. 80‚Äì96), p. 90. He told a conference in 2000: > If a chimp pulls its hand away after an electric shock, we say she > presumably must have felt an analogous subjective experience to what we call > pain. But cockroaches, slugs and snails‚Äîwhich are not protected by > legislation‚Äîalso reacted in the same way, while tests on flies showed they > could associate a smell with receiving an electric shock. If it is a chimp > we say it feels pain, if a fly we don't. Why?Highfield, Roger (11 May 2000). > \\"Cockroach capable of feeling pain, says study\\", The Daily Telegraph. =Laboratory mice= Sherwin's most influential research was on the behaviour and welfare of laboratory mice. In one highly cited study, published in 1998, he built a device that allowed five mice to leave their cages‚Äîby pressing levers to open the door‚Äîfor a loop that they could run around, a series of tunnels, or a wheel. Over time, they had to press the lever more often, up to 80 times, to gain access. Of the three options, the loop was the least preferred, and the wheel was \\"least affected by increasing the cost of access\\".Fraser, David (2013) [2008]. Understanding Animal Welfare: The Science in its Cultural Context. Chichester: John Wiley & Sons, p. 199. As a result of that research, Sherwin was awarded a Universities Federation for Animal Welfare (UFAW) Hume Research Fellowship in 2001.\\"Vacation Scholars' Meeting\\", Universities Federation for Animal Welfare News-Sheet, March 2004, p. 6. He went on to conduct extensive studies on laboratory cage design, showing that mice kept in ordinary cages chose to drink more of an anxiety-reducing drug than mice housed in larger cages with nesting material, a nest box, and a running wheel, where they could burrow and be with other mice. He trained mice to open a lever to access cages with more space, varying how often the lever had to be pressed, and found that more space was something they were willing to work for. He found that cage colour affected mouse welfare, including body weight; the mice liked white cages most and red least. In another study, he demonstrated that mice need to engage in burrowing behaviour. Laboratory mice spent the same amount of time burrowing whether or not they were supplied with ready-made burrows. Sherwin used burrows constructed by the same mouse in an earlier part of the experiment, thereby addressing the argument that the mouse continued to burrow only because the ready-made burrows were inadequate.\\"Behavioural need\\", in D. S. Mills and Jeremy N. Marchant-Forde (eds.) (2010). The Encyclopedia of Applied Animal Behaviour and Welfare. Wallingford: CABI, p. 52. =Housing and husbandry= Sherwin wrote in 2004 that the behaviour and health of laboratory animals given standard housing and care are frequently abnormal, which may reduce the value of the data obtained from them.Hubrecht, Robert (210). \\"Enrichment: Animal welfare and experimental outcomes\\", in R. Hubrecht and J. Kirkwood (eds.). The UFAW Handbook on the Care and Management of Laboratory and Other Research Animals, 8th edition. Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell (pp. 136‚Äì146), p. 141\\\\. The RSPCA quoted from his paper in a brochure discussing corporate social responsibility and \\"the 3Rs\\". In 2007 he argued, in a letter to Nature, that it was good science to include details about the handling and housing of laboratory animals in published papers, because factors such as cage size and flooring can influence metabolism, temperature, blood pressure and feeding behaviour. =Other work= From 1998 to 2001 Sherwin sat on the Council of the International Society for Applied Ethology (ISAE). He later chaired the ISAE's Animal Ethics Committee, and was the lead author in 2003 of its ethical guidelines. In 2006 he was the lead organizer of the 40th International Congress of the ISAE at Bristol. He also served as secretary of the Ethical Committee of the Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour, and sat on the editorial board of the journal Animal Sentience. He was a member of the Joint Working Group on Refinement (JWGR), set up by the British Veterinary Association's Animal Welfare Foundation, FRAME, the RSPCA and UFAW, which produced a report on laboratory birds in 2001. Background information on the JWGR: \\"Joint Working Group on Refinement\\" , RSCPA. In 2005 he sat on the European Food Safety Authority's (EFSA) working group on laboratory animals. Sherwin's team, led by Donald Broom, addressed the protection of invertebrates and animal fetuses. The assessment was adopted by the EFSA's Panel on Animal Health and Welfare in November 2005, which decided that animal fetuses should be given anaesthesia and analgesia for procedures that would cause pain in the newborn of the same species. After his retirement, Sherwin became an editor on Wikipedia, where he wrote nearly fifty articles. Selected works Sherwin published over 62 works, including:  *Sherwin, Chris M.

The group was composed of small cells of activists working in dozens of countries on several continents. In 2012, the Southern Poverty Law Center classified NIO as a domestic hate group. NIO's local campaign to stop animal experimentation at the University of Florida was named Eleventh Hour for Animals.  University of Florida  In 2010, she sued the University of Florida (UF) after they refused to disclose public information about their animal experimentation program. On December 30, 2011, Circuit Court Judge Martha Ann Lott ordered UF to disclose their primate experimentation records. Information that was redacted in those documents was challenged and on February 2013, a precedent was set in Florida when an appeals court ruled that the locations of the University of Florida's animal labs were public record. On February 4, 2012, Camille Marino was arrested protesting primate experimentation at The University of Florida. She was to be extradited to face charges in Detroit leveled by a Wayne State University researcher.  Wayne State University incident  In October 2011, a Wayne State University (WSU) researcher obtained a restraining order against Camille Marino demanding that she remove his personal information from her NIO website in Florida. She refused and was charged with a misdemeanor count of civil contempt in Detroit. Marino staged an act of civil disobedience on the WSU campus, chaining herself to the library and taping her mouth. She was charged with trespassing as well as two felonies: aggravated stalking and the unlawful posting of a message with aggravated circumstances. The aggravated stalking charge for violating the restraining order was dropped. To the second charge, which involved threatening the torture and murder of a medical researcher, she pleaded guilty and served six months.  Issue with fellow activist  In 2012, Steven Best, a fellow activist, took out a restraining order in New Mexico which sought to prevent her from contacting him or speaking about him, alleging that Marino had stalked and threatened violence against him.

It premiered on September 10, 2017, on premium cable network HBO; the pilot was released in advance on HBO streaming service HBO Go on August 25. The episode was written by creators and showrunners George Pelecanos and David Simon, and was directed by Michelle MacLaren.  Plot  In 1971, Brooklyn bartender Vincent \\"Vinnie\\" Martino (James Franco) is beaten by muggers while he is performing drops. Vinnie's identical twin brother, reckless gambler Frankie (Franco), owes money to several mobsters and bookies. Fed up with his unfaithful wife, Andrea (Zoe Kazan), Vinnie leaves his family and decides to focus on his bar. Pimp C.C. (Gary Carr) recruits Lori (Emily Meade), a new arrival from Minnesota, as a prostitute. C.C's prized possession is Ashley (Jamie Neumann), who is in love with C.C. and becomes jealous of Lori. Another pimp, Larry Brown (Gbenga Akinnagbe), is abusive towards his prostitutes, one of whom is the sweet-natured Darlene (Dominique Fishback). Eileen \\"Candy\\" Merrell (Maggie Gyllenhaal), a prostitute and single mother, chooses to work without a pimp and becomes introduced in the ascendant pornography industry. College student Abigail \\"Abby\\" Parker (Margarita Levieva) is arrested for buying drugs. At the station, she meets officer Chris Alston (Lawrence Gilliard Jr.), who is versed on the players in the streets. The arresting officer, Flanagan (Don Harvey), lets her go without charge and takes her to Vinnie's bar, but Abby becomes attracted to Vinnie. She arrives for her exam the following morning, but leaves the building. At his hotel, Vinnie witnesses C.C. wounding Ashley with a knife after she refuses to work in the rain.  Production  James Franco was the first actor to sign on to the project In August 2015, it was reported that HBO had picked up two David Simon pilots, one of which being The Deuce, which would star James Franco and be directed by Breaking Bad regular Michelle MacLaren. In September, Maggie Gyllenhaal was cast as a Times Square hooker in the pilot, which was set to begin filming in the fall of that year. In preparation for the project, she consulted with former prostitute and porn star Annie Sprinkle. ‚ÄúShe had some very simple helpful insights... How many people do you fuck a night, what do you do if it‚Äôs really cold.‚Äù Gyllenhaal also went to the set of a porn shoot in Los Angeles, having been invited by a former adult film star who was working craft services for the shot. Of the project, Simon said \\"We‚Äôre interested in what it means when profit is the primary metric for what we call society. In that sense, this story is intended as neither prurient nor puritan. It‚Äôs about a product, and those human beings who created, sold, profited from and suffered with that product... Porn, prostitution, pimps, the Mob, after-hours nightlife, institutional corruption, and New York in its Wild West heyday ... it‚Äôs a world rich in character, and a fascinating story we‚Äôre eager to tell.\\" Filming began in October 2015, and in January, 2016, the pilot was picked up for series.  Reception  The pilot episode was watched by 830,000 viewers and received an 0.24 18-49 rating.

The V213 E-Class is also known as the E-Class L (the \\"L\\" stands for \\"Long\\") and is the longest E-Class yet, with an overall length of 5.067m. The V213 comes in three basic models: the E200L, E300, and the E320L, which can be chosen with either Exclusive line or AMG Line bodies. The E-Class is equipped with an M274 or M276 engine, each powerful enough to accelerate the E200L from 0-60 mph in 8.6s, the E300L in 6.9s, and the E320L 4MATIC in 5.7s. The E-class is equipped with the 9G-Tronic transmission that features better efficiency and smoother gear changes than previous models.  Controversy  Since its launch, controversies in China have continued. Taking inspiration in its design from the Mercedes-Benz S-Class and due to its long body, the V213 has been seen as the \\"smaller\\" S-Class. Even though every V213 comes equipped factory standard with a 12.3 inch display, automatic brakes, onboard Wifi and wireless charging, some customers have been dissatisfied that other new signature features, such as multi-beam headlights, are optional extras.

The fact that some of the standard features of the V213 are not available for the W213 and has made the V213 more popular than the W213.

Their language is known as Pirriya (also known as Biria/Birria). Language The Pirriya language, also known as Bidia, Birria and other variations, was proposed by Gavan Breen to be one of a group he called Karnic languages. There is now some doubt about the validity of that category. Robert M. W. Dixon classifies it as one of two languages, the other being Kungkari, forming a subgroup of the Maric languages. Country Bidia country enclosed some . The western frontier was around Whitula Creek, the eastern one at Keeroongooloo and the Canaway Range. The Bidia lived on the western side of the Thomson River and Cooper Creek, from Jundah across to the vicinity of Gilpeppee. Customs The Biria were one of the tribes that practiced initiatory circumcision. Tooth evulsion was imposed on males at the age of 12. The Bidia built huts out of hollowed sand, which were then strengthened by wicker-type sapling and earth mounds. Fires for cooking and warmth were then kindled inside. They fashioned fishing nets from a type of native hemp. Apart from reptiles, their diet, subject to the austerities of a harsh climate often subject to drought, was based on a staple of damper, from flour leached out of the sporocarps of nardoo and grass seeds, cooked into a damper over ashes. It was said by recently arrived settlers that the dry spell was so severe in 1876-1878 that they ate all of their children, for want of food. Marriage was monogamous, males being denied any other wife than the one they had, and the couple married in mid-adolescence. A ban existed on having children until a much later stage, around 30 years of age, a practice that made infanticide common. White observers were surprised to note that the Bidia would embrace and even kiss on meeting up after a long period of separation. History of contact Pastoral development of their territory began in 1874, with the establishment of the Whitula Creek Station. At that time the Bidia's numbers were estimated to be roughly 500.

Three armed robbers used a skylight under repair to gain entry to the museum from its roof, tied up the three guards on duty, and left on foot with 18 paintings, including a rare Rembrandt landscape and works by Jan Brueghel the Elder, Corot, Delacroix, Rubens, and Thomas Gainsborough, as well as some figurines and jewellery. One of the Brueghels was returned by the thieves as an initiative to start ransom negotiations. None of the other paintings has ever been recovered and the robbers have never been arrested or even publicly identified, although there is at least one informal suspect. Collectively, the missing paintings have been valued at $11.7 million in 2017 dollars; although their value may have diminished since the theft as scholars have called the attribution of some of the works into question. However, the Rembrandt alone has been valued at $1 million; in 2003 The Globe and Mail estimated it to have appreciated in value to $20 million. The thieves appeared to know what works they were looking for; many of the works had been part of Masterpieces from Montreal, a travelling exhibition that had been to many museums in the U.S. and Canada prior to Expo 67, as well as some other special exhibits put on by the museum in the preceding years. It is not only the largest art theft in Canada but the largest theft in Canadian history. Investigation of the crime proved difficult in the early going, since it occurred over the Labour Day holiday weekend, when many of the museum's officials including its director were vacationing far away from Montreal. It was further complicated by continuing news coverage of the Blue Bird Caf√© fire, Montreal's deadliest arson, three days earlier, dominating the headlines; the next day the killings of Israeli athletes by Palestinian terrorists at the Olympics in Munich further diminished media coverage. A sting operation conceived after the thieves returned the Brueghel (later reattributed to his students) and mailed photos of the other works to the museum seeking a ransom payment went awry; a later attempt to negotiate their return cost the museum $10,000 with no results. The thieves took advantage of weakened security, resulting from the renovations at the museum, which had left the skylight's alarm disabled. The renovations and the security flaws were themselves a consequence of the museum's tightening finances, which had worsened during the 1960s as many of the wealthy Anglophone community in Montreal that had supported the museum since its founding in 1860 began to leave for Toronto due to increasing concerns over Quebec separatism, especially after terrorist acts by the Front de lib√©ration du Qu√©bec had led to martial law in the Montreal area two years earlier. S√ªret√© du Qu√©bec, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Interpol continue to investigate the crime. Theories as to who might be responsible have ranged from the Montreal Mafia to Quebec separatists. Background alt=A three-story light stone building with a flat green-trimmed roof from which the Canadian, Quebec and Montreal flags are flying from poles at the center, seen from a three-quarters angle about midway up its height from across an intersection. On its front face is a recessed entry area with four fluted columns topped by Corinthian capitals. Banners to either side have the word \\"Chihuly\\", and the entablature has \\"Montreal Museum of Fine Arts\\" and \\"Mus√©e de Beaux Art du Montr√©al in capital metal letters The Montreal Museum of Fine Arts (MMFA) was established in 1860 as the Art Association of Montreal, to encourage art appreciation in the city. It did not start to exhibit works until the late 1870s and 1880s, when wealthy patrons who had prospered from Canada's industrialization began to donate both cash and works, and it was soon able to build Canada's first space explicitly intended for the exhibition of art. In 1913 it built what is currently its main building, now known as the Michal and Renata Hornstein Pavilion, on Sherbrooke Street in the neighborhood known even today as the Golden Square Mile, because it was home to many of the wealthiest and most successful families in Canada. These patrons were predominantly of British descent, all members of Montreal's Anglophone elite. At the end of the 1950s, their political and economic domination of the city began to yield to its majority Francophone population, as Quebec separatism began to gain political influence in the province as a whole. Fearing the consequences should the province succeed in seceding, and mindful of the terrorist attacks of the Front de lib√©ration du Qu√©bec which had led to martial law being declared in the city in 1970, the Anglophone elite began leaving the city over the course of the 1960s. This slowly deprived the museum of much of its traditional financial support. In 1957, Bill Bantey, a former journalist who was appointed the museum's head of public relations, began reaching out for the first time in its history to Francophones, with some success. But the contributions from newer philanthropists in the city were not as much as their predecessors had been able to give, and public funds from the province only covered 40 percent of the museum's annual budget. As a result, the museum was having to cut back financially in the early 1970s, going from a strictly private institution to a semi-public nonprofit organization. The museum needed to expand, and it needed to renovate the 1913 William Sutherland Maxwell Beaux-Arts building on Sherbrooke Street. The latter was particularly unsuited to the demands of a late-20th century art museum, with many cramped rooms and corridors. The museum planned to close it in 1973 for a three-year renovation project. =Previous thefts and attempts= On two prior occasions thieves took, or attempted to take, works from the museum. One night in 1933, a person who had hidden in the museum overnight passed 14 paintings, mostly by Canadian artists, to someone else through an open window in the women's lavatory. Later the museum received a ransom note asking $10,000 for the return of the paintings. Three months later, the English-language Montreal Star and the French La Presse each received half of one of the paintings in the mail. A note along with them said if a ransom of 25 percent of the remaining paintings' total value was not paid, they too would be returned in pieces. The paintings were recovered before that could occur when Paul Thouin, a petty criminal, was arrested after burglarizing a rail freight car. During interrogation, he confessed to stealing the paintings and led police to where he had buried them, wrapped in a tarpaulin with newspapers, in a one-metre- deep (3 ft) sandpit near the village of L'√âpiphanie a short distance northeast of Montreal. Thouin, who had shot and killed a police officer attempting to apprehend him in a railroad warehouse, was reportedly terrified at the prospect of being returned to prison for what would likely be a very long time. He committed suicide by poisoning himself with a concealed dose of strychnine in the police lockup that night, before he could stand trial. A gang of armed robbers attempted to steal some van Gogh paintings during a special exhibition of the artist's work at the museum in 1960. They were foiled and escaped. They have never been identified. =Labour Day weekend 1972 in Montreal= In Montreal, Labour Day weekend of 1972 began with two major news events, neither of them positive. On the night of Friday, September 1, four men who had been refused entry to a downtown country-and-western bar for being too intoxicated retaliated by setting the club's steps afire; the ensuing blaze killed 37, making it the deadliest fire in the city in 45 years. On the following evening, the Soviet national hockey team defeated their Canadian counterparts 7‚Äì3 in the first game of the Summit Series at the Montreal Forum. Canadians, who had expected their team, composed of National Hockey League stars, to overwhelmingly defeat the Soviets, who had only begun competing in international ice hockey a quarter-century earlier, at what Canadians considered their national sport were stunned. Fans in Montreal were eagerly looking ahead to the next game in the series, to be held Monday evening in Toronto. At the museum, the board president, director, and director of security were all on vacation in either the United States or Mexico for the holiday weekend. Bantey, the public relations director, was the most senior official in charge. Robbery Shortly after midnight on the morning of September 4, police believe, a group of three men gathered out in front of the museum on Sherbrooke Street. They went to the museum's west wall, between it and the Church of St. Andrew and St. Paul. One of the men, who had the same sort of pick-equipped boots used by utility-company workers to climb telephone poles, went up a tree next to the museum and got high enough in it to gain access to the roof. He was able to find a ladder, and lowered it to the other two, who climbed up. Once the group was on the roof, they went to a skylight that had been covered by a plastic sheet in the course of some ongoing work. They opened the skylight, without setting off any alarm as the plastic sheet had rendered it inoperative, and lowered a nylon rope to the museum's second floor. All three slid down. It had taken them almost an hour and a half to gain entry to the museum. Shortly after they did, around 1:30 a.m., one of the three guards on duty was walking to the kitchen to get some tea. He encountered the thieves, their faces covered by ski masks, who fired both barrels of a pump action shotgun into the ceiling to get his attention and made him lie down on the floor. The noise brought the other two guards, who were unable to overpower the thieves, and soon all three guards were taken to a lecture hall where they were bound and gagged. There, one of the robbers, who carried a .38-caliber Smith & Wesson handgun, stood guard while the other two removed paintings, jewellery and figurines from their displays and brought them to the museum's shipping department. The thieves originally seemed to have planned to leave via the same skylight they had come in through, but eventually concluded it would take too much time to put together a system of pulleys to get themselves and the stolen artwork out. After finding that one of the guards had a set of keys to one of the museum's panel trucks, they decided instead to flee that way. However, this alternative also went awry. They chose to exit through one of the museum's side entrances, where an alarm went off as they did so. Leaving half their take behind, they fled on foot down Sherbrooke. Back at the museum, one of the guards worked to free himself. An hour after the robbery ended, around 3 a.m., he succeeded and called Bill Bantey, who told him to call the police. He arrived shortly after the police, along with Ruth Jackson, the museum's curator of decorative arts. After surveying the broken frames, smashed display cases and general disorder the thieves had left, they found that 18 paintings and 38 other pieces had been taken. Collectively they estimated the value of the stolen work at $2 million. Works stolen Rembrandt's Landscape with Cottages, the most valuable of the stolen works, seen here in a black-and-white image from the artist's 1968 alt=A slightly sepia-toned image of a painting showing a cottage surrounded by dark trees under an overcast late-evening sky All of the stolen paintings were by European artists from the 17th through 19th centuries: *Landscape with Vehicles and Cattle, attributed at the time to Jan Brueghel the Elder but later reattributed to his students (subsequently recovered) *Landscape with Buildings and Wagon, Jan Brueghel the Elder *La r√™veuse √° la fontaine (The Dreaming Woman at the Fountain), Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot *Jeune fille accoud√©e sur le bras gauche (Young Girl Leaning on Her Left Arm), Corot *Landscape with rocks and stream, Gustave Courbet *Head, Honor√© Daumier *Lioness and Lion in a Cave, Eug√®ne Delacroix *The Sorceress, Narcisse Virgilio D√≠az *Portrait of Brigadier General Sir Thomas Fletcher, Thomas Gainsborough *Still Life: Vanitas, Jan Davidsz de Heem *Still Life with a Fish, de Heem *La barrateuse (Young Woman Churning), Jean-Fran√ßois Millet *Portrait of Madame Millet, Millet *Portrait of a Man, Possibly a Self- portrait, Giovanni Battista Piazzetta *Landscape with Cottages, Rembrandt van Rijn *Head of a Young Man, Peter Paul Rubens *Portrait of a Lady, Fran√ßois- Andr√© Vincent *Portrait of a Man, Vincent Most of the paintings taken were small works around a foot (31 cm) along their longest dimension; the three smallest (the Brueghels and Millet's La barrateuse) were less than , smaller than a standard letter-size piece of paper. The largest was the Courbet, at 28 by 36 inches (), with the Gainsborough and Corot's Dreamer close behind. It was possible that when the thieves ran away each of them held a batch of smaller paintings in one hand and a larger one in the other. The thieves also took 38 pieces of jewellery and figurines. Among the former pieces were an 18th-century gold watch once owned by the wife of Jacques Viger, Montreal's first mayor; a 19th-century French blue enamel latch box set with diamonds and two 17th-century Spanish pendants. Investigation Later that morning, Bantey, who had covered the crime beat in Montreal as a journalist prior to his tenure at the museum, held a news conference to discuss the theft. He identified all the stolen works and described how the robbers had entered the museum and taken them. \\"They did show quite discriminating taste,\\" he told reporters, \\"though as far as the objects are concerned, they could do with more art and historical training.\\" In their haste to leave, he noted, the thieves had left behind another Rembrandt as well as works by El Greco, Picasso and Tintoretto that they could as easily have taken. The news conference was initially effective in publicizing the theft. It, as well as lists of the stolen paintings, were reported as front-page news in many major newspapers across the U.S. and Canada the next morning. As soon as they learned of the theft, Montreal police had also put out the alert to the crossings along the U.S. border, about from Montreal, to look out for the thieves and/or the paintings should anyone attempt to take them to New York City, farther south. However, further publicity that might have drawn attention to the theft and perhaps helped solve it was stymied by news events of September 5. At that year's Summer Olympics in Munich, Palestinian terrorists with Black September took 11 Israeli athletes hostage, eventually killing them along with a German police officer, the following day. Those events were of particular interest in Montreal since the city was preparing to host the next Olympics, and as a result further news about the art theft got less priority in the media. The investigation would continue, however. From interviews with the three guards, police learned that there had been three thieves. The guards saw two of them, describing them as both about in height. One spoke French and the other English. The guards also reported that the two spoke with a third, also a Francophone, whom they never were able to see. Investigators were immediately struck by the similarity to another recent art theft in the Montreal area. On August 30, another group of three thieves had broken into the summer home of Agnes Meldrum, wife of a Montreal moving- company owner, in Oka, roughly 30 kilometres (20 miles) west of the city. They had all climbed up a 200-metre (600-foot) cliff from a powerboat on Lake of Two Mountains to do so. Witnesses said that while they wore hoods to prevent identification, two spoke French and the other, English. Once inside the home they stole paintings worth $50,000 in total. =Inside-job theory= The presence of two Francophones and one Anglophone, plus the climbing skills involved, led the chief investigator on the case to believe the thieves involved in both incidents had been local, and possibly the same. That, and their apparent knowledge of the skylight's non-functional alarm, had at first fostered a theory that someone on the inside at the museum had aided the thieves in some way. This is a common phenomenon when museums are robbed; two New York City detectives who specialized in art crime said as much when commenting about the Montreal case later in 1972. However, the Montreal police considered that speculation too broad to be helpful in focusing their investigation, and evidence did not bear it out. While it was possible that the thieves had indeed actively involved someone working on the skylight, it was as possible that they, or others involved with them, had learned of the security flaw through an overheard remark somewhere. An intense investigation of the workers involved with the skylight did not find any evidence they had passed information about it to anyone criminally inclined. It was also seen as possible that the robbers had learned of the skylight flaw by simply reconnoitering their target. Roughly two weeks before the theft, someone reported encountering two men sitting on chairs on the roof, wearing sunglasses and smoking. When questioned by the person who reported the incident, they claimed to be museum employees. But when investigators looked for the chairs on the roof after the theft, they could not be found. Likewise, no fingerprints or other evidence was left on either the ladder or nylon rope. Theories of an inside job were also undermined by the thieves' poorly planned exit. After abandoning their improvised plan to leave by the same skylight when they realized it would take too long to set up a system of pulleys, they instead chose to try to flee in one of the museum's trucks. If they had based that alternative on inside information they had obtained, they would have known how to disable the alarm they set off on the side entrance before opening it. And even if they had not chosen to do so, they would have known it did not sound anywhere else besides the museum‚Äîand thus not have abandoned half of what they had stolen to escape on foot. =Selection of works= While the jewellery and figurines seem to have been chosen only because they could be easily carried, the paintings stolen seem to have been a matter of choice. Their small size, in addition to making them easy to carry and conceal, would also facilitate quick sales. The robbers, and any dealer working with them, might, investigators have speculated, have been looking to sell to private collectors who display their paintings in their homes. Indeed, the pairs of small paintings with similar subject matter by the same artist‚ÄîBrueghel, Corot, Millet and Vincent‚Äîwould be excellent choices to decorate a room. Interest in art in recent years had driven up prices, a phenomenon which had been widely reported in both French- and English-language media, and the thieves would have known even if they had no interest in art what collectors were willing to pay large sums for. Some art dealers in the Montreal area refused to discuss their business with police absent a legal order such as a subpoena or warrant. Around Christmas 1972, a Montreal Gazette columnist reported that, in fact, most of the paintings had been delivered to the homes of wealthy collectors in Mount Royal, with a small portion diverted to the U.S. This led police to interrogate two unnamed individuals, but no new leads developed as a result. The robbers might not even have had to visit the museum to decide what works to take. Half of those they did keep when they ran away had been in Masterpieces from Montreal, a travelling exhibition that had been to several cities in the U.S. during the year before Expo 67. The Rembrandt had been included in a 1969 exhibit to commemorate the tricentennial of the artist's death, and the following year many of the French paintings had been in another exhibit that the press in that language gave great attention to. All those works in the special exhibitions would have been depicted in handbooks or catalogues produced in association with them. Only the Brueghels, the Rubens and the Vincent portraits had not been included in those exhibits nor mentioned in any publication save the museum's own catalogue. =Possible early suspects= Early in their investigation, the police began looking into a group of students at the nearby √âcole des beaux-arts de Montr√©al. Mostly French-speaking, they had often visited the museum but had frequently been asked to leave before its official closing time so that the mostly English- speaking staff could take their tea. This had engendered considerable resentment on the students' part. Police kept five of these students under 24-hour surveillance for two weeks. Eventually they decided they could not find any evidence, and dropped that part of the investigation. Alain Lacoursi√®re, an art-theft specialist with the Montreal police who investigated the cold case in later years, by his own account taking it over just before the files were slated to be shredded in 1984, believes the students were not involved. \\"This crime was organized with a guy in charge who was 35 to 40 years old,\\" well past his student years, he said in 2010. Ransom negotiations and recovery attempts In many art thefts the thieves seek ransom payments in return for the stolen works, and this happened twice in the MMFA thefts. Within a week of the robbery museum director David Giles Carter received a phone call from, he believed, one of the thieves. A man with a gravelly voice and an accent Carter described as \\"European\\" gave him directions to a phone booth near McGill University, near which one of the stolen pendants was found. Soon afterwards, a brown manila Port of Montreal envelope arrived at the museum with snapshots of the stolen paintings. Carter nicknamed the thief \\"Port of Montreal\\" as a result, and dialogue was opened up between the museum and the thieves to negotiate a ransom. At first the thieves demanded $500,000, about a quarter of the works' stated value; later they halved that. alt=A dark modern brick building with lighter buildings rising to the top of the image behind it. On a corner in front is signage in French advertising offices for rent in the building Carter demanded the thieves, or whoever it was negotiating on their behalf, give more proof they had the paintings than snapshots. In response, they told the museum's security director to go to a locker in Montreal Central Station. Inside, he found the Brueghel Landscape with Buildings and Wagon. It is the only one of the stolen paintings that has so far been recovered. As a result of these negotiations, approximately a month later the museum's insurance companies and the Montreal police set up a sting operation. An undercover detective posed as an insurance adjustor and agreed to meet the thieves or their representative in an empty field in one of the city's suburbs, where he hoped the thieves would believe he was ready to hand over $5,000 for another one of the paintings. However, when one of the local police cruisers passed by, completely unaware of the plans, the thieves apparently came to realize what was actually going on and never met the undercover officer. The next day they called Carter and complained that they had been set up. Lacoursi√®re believes that it was actually the museum and the police who were being set up. The field the robbers had chosen as the meeting site had few nearby houses at the time and could easily have been monitored from some distance away, allowing the robbers to detect even the more subtle police presence necessary to support a sting operation. \\"It was all a smokescreen\\", he says. Since the thieves never reopened negotiations afterwards, he believes they never had any intention of returning the paintings at the time and were using the purported ransom negotiations as a diversion while they bought themselves more time to sell or otherwise dispose of the paintings. The second attempt took place the following year. A few months after the museum closed for its three-year renovation project in May 1973, a caller to a member of the museum's board said he would share where the paintings were hidden for $10,000. Andr√© DeQuoy, one of the adjusters handling the case, was involved in the discussion and made it clear that while the insurance companies would pay for information leading to the discovery of the painting, they would not pay for the paintings themselves. After he agreed to deliver it personally to the source, the board made the money available. The caller had instructed DeQuoy, who was being discreetly followed by police, to go to a certain phone booth in downtown Montreal one afternoon. From there the caller sent him to other phone booths elsewhere in the city, such as the Blue Bonnets race track, on St. Laurent Boulevard and at the Henri-Bourassa station on the Montreal Metro. The caller then informed DeQuoy that he had picked up the police tail and DeQuoy was to return to his office and await further instructions while the caller had the unmarked car called off. DeQuoy did, and an hour later the caller said the police had been taken care of. Again he was sent out to phone booths, ultimately traveling back and forth across the island of Montreal to 11 of them, until at 4 a.m. the next morning he was told he could leave the envelope at the base of a sign in a vacant lot on St. Martin Boulevard, then return to the Henri-Bourassa phone booth where the caller would contact him again with the location of the paintings. While DeQuoy waited for the call, he let the police know where he had been all night. But the caller never called, so the adjustor returned to his office. At 8 a.m. the caller called him there and told him the paintings were in a motel in Laval, north of Montreal. An intensive search of the building, however, produced neither the paintings nor any sign they had ever been there. The $10,000 was not recovered. Later developments Due to the minimal news coverage, in January 1973 Bill Bantey put together a circular, Attention: Stolen, depicting the stolen paintings and giving information such as their dimensions, in English and French. The idea was to distribute it widely throughout the international art community and familiarize possible buyers with the stolen works, a practice that was not common in art thefts at the time as most museums preferred to keep the news of their victimization to themselves. Major auction houses like Sotheby's and Christie's would not routinely check for whether art offered for sale through them was on lists of stolen works until 1985. \\"[We hope that] the works become so catalogued and so well-known that it would be unlikely that any collector or museum buyer could innocently purchase them,\\" Bantey told the Gazette. The museum and investigators did not make the ransom negotiations in the year after the thefts public knowledge until ten years later. \\"For years we thought our chances of recovery were better keeping everything quiet,\\" said one police detective, explaining the decision. \\"But now our hopes are small. Maybe this will stimulate interest and produce something.\\" But while it did allow police to confirm what they have only described as \\"certain facts\\", those have apparently not led to any progress in the case. The recovered Brueghel was kept in storage at the museum by Ruth Jackson for ten years until a new frame could be purchased, after which it was returned to the place it had been exhibited prior to the theft. However, it was later determined that it was not by Brueghel but one of his students; Lacoursi√®re believes the thieves may have chosen to return it due to doubts about its authenticity. It nevertheless remains on exhibit. A similar fate befell the painting the museum bought with the money it received from its insurers. A group of 20 of them paid out nearly $2 million to settle the claim; they in turn posted a $50,000 reward for the return of the paintings, which under the terms of the insurance policies they legally owned as a result of paying the theft claim. The museum used the money to purchase a Rubens, The Leopards, which the museum promoted as the largest Rubens exhibited in Canada. But like the Brueghel, it was later reattributed to the painter's assistants, after a conservationist determined that its red pigments were mixed four decades after Rubens' death, reducing its value and interest to museumgoers. On the 35th anniversary of the robbery, in 2007, the museum thus returned it to storage and has never put it on display again. Even the attribution of some of the stolen work has been called into question. When the de Heems were being prepared for their inclusion in Masterpieces from Montreal, a Parisian art historian the museum contacted suggested that they were in fact the work of another Dutch master, Evert Collier. The Rembrandt landscape, while indeed signed and dated by the artist, is one that both he and his students frequently returned to as a subject, and some historians are not entirely confident the painting was his even with the signature. The Gainsborough portrait, too, may in fact be the work of Joshua Reynolds, Gainsborough's rival, since its subject, Thomas Fletcher, is shown wearing a Madras regimental uniform, which he only started wearing in 1771, three years before his portrait was painted by Reynolds. In 1992, on the 20th anniversary of the theft, a Radio-Canada story reported that the insurance companies now considered the paintings' value to have appreciated to $20 million. They had consequently increased the reward offer to $100,000. On behalf of the Montreal police, Lacoursi√®re, who began investigating art crime in 1994, offered an additional million in 1999. No one has yet come forward to claim these rewards. Lacoursi√®re has had some promising leads over the years that have yielded nothing. He has been told that the paintings, or some of them, are in Italy, and that two Montreal men in the French city of Nice were possible suspects. One heroin addict he interviewed in Vancouver seemed to have inside information about the robbery, but everything he knew had been previously reported in the media; when he was asked about two details that police have withheld since only the actual robbers would know them, he was unable to do so. =\\"Smith\\"= One lead, however, has not been so easy for Lacoursi√®re to dismiss. In 1998, a dealer he had gotten to know introduced him to a man who has been identified publicly only by the pseudonym \\"Smith\\". Smith told the detective he, too, had been a student at the √âcole des beaux-arts at the time of the theft, explaining to him the tension between the students and museum staff. In the course of their initial conversation, Lacoursi√®re quickly came to believe Smith knew a great deal about the robbery, perhaps more than the police did. Although Smith said he had not been one of the five students kept under surveillance afterward, he told the detective that the rope used by the thieves to enter from the skylight was not gray as had been reported at the time, but yellow like the ones used at the school building. However, upon reviewing the original file and talking with one of the original investigators, Lacoursi√®re found that any information on the colour of the rope had been deliberately withheld by police in order to confirm any later confessions or statements by possible suspects. He considered Smith's statements \\"highly suspicious\\". Lacoursi√®re investigated Smith's background, and found that a year after finishing his five-year course at the school, Smith had spent a quarter of a million dollars to buy himself a house and a local woodworking company. Lacoursi√®re could not determine how Smith might have acquired that amount of money at such a relatively young age. He implied in 2010 it might have been from selling the stolen work. According to Lacoursi√®re, Smith even told him that he would at some point in the future tell him something about the robbery. In 2007, during the filming of \\"L'Colombe d'art\\" (\\"The Colombo of Art\\"), a Radio-Canada special on his career as an art-theft detective, Lacoursi√®re visited Smith and offered him the million-dollar cheque on camera. Smith, however, simply laughed, and invited the camera crew into his house so they could see for themselves that he had none of the stolen paintings. In 2010, Quebec journalist Sylvain Larocque interviewed Smith by telephone. While he again denied any role in the theft himself, he claimed that professors and porters at the Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al, which the √âcole des beaux-arts had been merged into in 1969, were behind the robbery. They were possibly, he claimed, the same people behind a robbery at the university a few weeks earlier. The following year Lacoursi√®re received a link to a video in an email from Smith, possibly intended to tease the detective, who by then had retired. It was a Mercedes-Benz advertisement from Hong Kong in which bank robbers steal a briefcase from a bank vault, then escape in a Mercedes. They elude capture but leave the briefcase behind; inside is a long-lost stolen da Vinci painting. Theories of the paintings' current whereabouts The robbery is now largely forgotten, except by the insurance companies and police, who continue to search. \\"Like a death in the family, you have to let it drop,\\" Bantey says. However, in 2009, Paul Lavall√©e, the museum's director at the time, said it continues to affect the museum, since it might not be able to reclaim the works even if they were recovered. \\"[W]e would be strapped for funds,\\" he said, even if the insurer offered them to the museum at a discount. It is possible the paintings may have been destroyed to prevent them from being used as evidence against those in possession of them. But Lacoursi√®re believes they were likely sold through smaller dealers who may not have known they were stolen, or cared if they did, to collectors who likewise keep them private, especially today, since they cannot sell them. He also notes that criminal organizations have found stolen art useful in other ways. During the 1994‚Äì2002 Quebec Biker war, he recalls, he learned that one member of the Montreal-area Hells Angels served as a fence for art thieves, selling stolen art to the Italian Mafia at 10 percent of its price, who in turn used the names of dead residents of the affluent suburb of Westmount on faked provenance forms. While it is not believed likely that the original robbers were affiliated with organized crime, the ransom attempts may point in that direction. The Port of Montreal envelope in which the snapshots of the stolen art was sent may suggest the involvement of the West End Gang, an Irish-dominated group that is one of Canada's oldest and strongest criminal organizations, which has historically been based in the city's port. Bantey, however, doubts this based on his familiarity with the city's criminal element from his journalism days. \\"[They] were interested in prostitution and drugs\\" exclusively at the time, he says, and no one involved would have had the expertise required to pull off the robbery. Nor does he believe the thieves were motivated by separatism or any other political cause, just a desire to enrich themselves. Despite some suggestions the paintings, assuming they still exist, are still in Montreal, or elsewhere in Canada or the U.S. or Europe, the investigators who will discuss this believe the art has been moved to Latin America. Lacoursi√®re notes that many of the West End Gang often spend their winters in, and retire to, Costa Rica. Police there have not responded to requests for assistance from their counterparts in Montreal. Bantey believes the paintings are in South America somewhere. \\"I've heard several people I respect say that.\\" The police files on the robbery remain closed to public inspection as the case is still considered open.

History  Cheshunt Grammar School was built in 1935 in Windmill Lane. Over the years many newer buildings were added around the original building. In 1988 the County Council closed the nearby Bishopslea School in College Road, and distributed the pupils around the other local schools, although Cheshunt Grammar School took most of the pupils and some teachers. In 1990, it was decided to move the entire school to the old Bishopslea School site in College Road. The new school was called Cheshunt School and opened in September 1992. The old Grammar School was demolished and became a housing estate, despite the County Council's explicit prior assurances during a consultation period with local residents that the site would not be used for housing and that it would instead be put to use for the local community, before the school was closed, with street names reflecting the names of past people at the school. Until 2005, the old outdoor pool remained disused and undeveloped, but has since been turned into flats. The school was previously known as Cheshunt School up until 2017 when it merged with Goffs School.

In a racing career which was delayed and repeatedly interrupted by training problems she won four of her ten races between May 1998 and October 2000. Unraced as a two-year-old, she won her only start at three and emerged as a top-class middle distance performer in the spring of 1999 with wins in the Earl of Sefton Stakes and Tattersalls Gold Cup and went on to finish second in the Champion Stakes in autumn. As a five-year-old she recorded an emphatic win in the Brigadier Gerard Stakes and then finished third in a strongly contested edition of the Eclipse Stakes. After her retirement from racing she had some success as a dam of winners. Background Shiva was a chestnut mare with a narrow white blaze bred in Japan by Northern Farm in partnership with Stavros Niarchos. During her racing career she was trained in Newmarket, Suffolk by Henry Cecil. She raced in the colours of the Niarchos Family who inherited the racing and breeding interests of Stavros Niarchos when the Greek shipping tycoon died in 1996. She was sired by Hector Protector, an American-bred stallion who won five Group 1 races in France including the Gran Criterium, Poule d'Essai des Poulains and Prix Jacques Le Marois. He was owned and bred by Stavros Niarchos but was sold at towards the end of his racing career and was retired to stud in Japan. Her dam, Lingerie, failed to win a race but was a daughter of Northern Trick, a mare who won the Prix Vermeille and finished second in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. Lingerie became a very successful broodmare who produced Light Shift and was the female-line ancestor of Main Sequence and Cloth of Stars. Racing career =1998: three-year-old season= Shiva was slow to mature and did not race as a two-year-old. She made her racecourse debut on 30 May 1998 when she started 7/4 favourite for a maiden race over nine furlongs at Kempton Park Racecourse. Ridden by Kieren Fallon she took the lead two furlongs from the finish and won by two lengths from the Michael Stoute-trained Shalama. The filly subsequently developed injury problems with her knees and did not race again that year. =1999: four-year-old season= After ten and a half months off the track, Shiva returned in the Group 3 Earl of Sefton Stakes over eight and a half furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse on 14 April 1999. The race was run on the July Course as the Rowley Mile Course was closed for redevelopment. Despite her lengthy absence and the sharp rise in class she started the 7/1 fourth choice in the betting behind Haami (winner of the Darley Stakes), White Heart (Doncaster Mile) and Handsome Ridge (Prix Perth). After starting slowly she began to make rapid progress in the last quarter mile, took the lead inside the final furlong and won by one and a quarter lengths from Haami. Another significant step up in class followed when the filly was sent to Ireland for the Group 1 Tattersalls Gold Cup over ten and a half furlongs at the Curragh on 23 May. With Fallon in the saddle she started the 100/30 second favourite behind Daylami with the best of the other four runners appearing to be Insatiable (Prix Dollar) and Second Empire (Grand Crit√©rium). She raced in fourth place before overtaking Daylami to go to the front a furlong out and kept on well to win by two and a half lengths. Henry Cecil commented \\"Shiva has had problems all her life, mostly with her knees, but I asked Maria Niarchos if I could keep her because I thought she would be a Group 1 horse. It is nice to be proved right. She is still a little bit green ‚Äì this was only her third race ‚Äì and I would think the Prince Of Wales's Stakes will be next. She should go on improving and will probably get a mile and a half\\". Willie Ryan took the ride when Shiva started second favourite behind Chester House in the Prince of Wales's Stakes at Royal Ascot on 15 June. The filly never looked like winning and came home seventh of the eight runners, twelve lengths behind the winner Lear Spear, a horse she had beaten easily in the Earl of Sefton. Another long break followed before Shiva returned for the Champion Stakes at Newmarket on 16 October and started favourite despite the presence of the 1998 winner Alborada and The Derby winner High-Rise. Ridden by Richard Quinn she stayed on well in the last quarter mile but was beaten into second place by Alborada. =2000: five-year-old season= On her first run of 2000 Shiva started favourite to repeat her 1999 success in the Earl of Sefton Stakes but finished unplaced behind Indian Lodge. On heavy ground at Sandown Park on 30 May Shiva started favourite for the Group 3 Brigadier Gerard Stakes against seven opponents including Border Arrow and Beat All both of whom had finished third in the Epsom Derby (in 1998 and 1999 respectively) as well as Elle Danzig (Bayerisches Zuchtrennen), Lady In Waiting (Sun Chariot Stakes) and Diamond White (Prix de l'Op√©ra). After racing second place, Shiva took the lead approaching the last quarter mile and quickly drew eight lengths clear of her opponents. She was eased down by Quinn in the final furlong and came home one and a half lengths in front of Border Arrow. Henry Cecil commented \\"She is a cracking mare. She must have easy going though. Last year she jarred herself up at Royal Ascot and was four gallops short before she ran in the Champion Stakes where she still managed to finish second. On this showing we now know how to ride her ‚Äì dominate!\\". In the Eclipse Stakes on 8 July, over the same course and distance as the Brigadier Gerard, Shiva was beaten but produced arguably her best performance. Despite being hampered inside the final furlong she finished third to Giant's Causeway and Kalanisi with Sakhee and Fantastic Light in fourth and fifth. Three weeks later she was moved up in distance for the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes over one and a half miles at Ascot but finished tailed off in last place behind Montjeu. As in 1999 Shiva took a long break before returning in the Champion Stakes. On her final racecourse appearance, she took the lead half a mile from the finish but faded in the last two furlongs and finished ninth of the fifteen runners behind Kalanisi. Breeding record At the end of her racing career, Shiva was retired to become a broodmare for the Niachos Family's Flaman Holdings breeding operation. She produced ten foals and three winners. *Eccentricity, a chestnut filly, foaled in 2002, sired by Kingmambo.

This suggests that the Trump administration has rejected the gender identity of trans people by defining sex as \\"immutable biological traits identifiable by or before birth.\\" History =Pre-first ban= Many women during the American Civil War disguised themselves as men to enlist as soldiers and fight in the war. During this time, women were not legally allowed to fight, however it is estimated there were more 400 women who were passing as male soldiers during the war. Many of these female soldiers' true identities were never discovered throughout the time of their service. As a result of many of those who fought in the war being \\"citizen soldiers\\", who had no prior military or combat training, men and women learned how to become a soldier in the same way. This gave women an advantage to learn how to be a good soldier at the same speed the men were learning, while also helping to keep their identity a secret. There were instances though, of soldiers being exposed of their true female identities, usually after having been hurt and sent to a soldiers' hospital. Most often, these women just received medical attention and were sent home. However, in several instances, some women who had been disguised as male soldiers were punished or even imprisoned. Albert Cashier, who was born Jennie Irene Hodgers in Belvidere, Illinois, on August 6, 1862, enlisted and served in the Union Army as a man. His identity remained unknown throughout the entirety of his service and he kept the identity of Albert Cashier for the remainder of his life. It wasn't until 1911, while working as a handy man, that he was struck by an automobile and fractured his leg. When a physician was called, it was discovered that Albert was in fact born a woman. Shortly after his injury he was admitted into the Soldiers' and Sailors' Home in Quincy Illinois, where in his application he gave his real name as Jennie Hodgers, and stated that he was born in Ireland on December 25, 1844. At the home, only the doctor knew of his true identity and he was able to continue to live as Albert Cashier along with other patients in the home. When his mental health became too deteriorated for the home to adequately take care of him, he was sent to an insane asylum at Watertown. At the asylum Albert was forced to wear dresses and accept the identity he was born with, Jennie Hodgers, until his passing in 1915. Albert Cashier was buried with full military honors. The first transgender American woman to undergo gender confirmation surgery (in 1952) was Christine Jorgensen, who had previously been drafted into the United States Army to serve during World War II. The surgery made front-page news with headlines such as \\"Ex-GI Becomes Blonde Beauty\\" (from the New York Daily News) focusing on her prior military service. =First ban on transgender personnel= According to scholars, since at least as early as 1960, Executive Order 10450 was applied to ban transgender individuals from serving in the United States military.Our History On May 17, 1963, individuals with gender issues were officially prohibited from the United States military by Army Regulation 40-501. This policy reasoned transgender people were medically unqualified to serve because their mental state was considered unfit. It wasn't until the 1980s, when the United States military decided to apply medical regulations more forcefully on those who identified as transgender. Medical care provided by the military did not cover hormone therapy and gender reassignment surgery. The psychological services weren't much better. If the topic of trans-related issues arises then confidentiality is usually breached and notified to commands for further action. If a person were to go through with a gender modification of some sort they'd be discharged or rejected from enlistment. Some people have disagreed with these regulations and have taken the policy to court. In the case Doe v. Alexander (1981), the Army defends their policy of denying enlistment to transsexual persons by stating that supporting transsexuals would raise a medical problem. The necessity of having hormone supplementation may not be available at certain placements this individual is placed. Another case of Leyland v. Orr (1987), where Air Force member Leyland, underwent a gender reassignment surgery before being discharged. The courts ruled this as valid due to the reasoning that Leyland was indeed unfit physically rather than mentally. This judgement was determined by inferring that genital surgery is similar to an amputation surgery, which leaves the individual unable to meet the demands of a soldier. =Presidency of Barack Obama= Under the current Department of Defense Instruction 6130.03, \\"Medical Standards for Appointment, Enlistment, or Induction in the Military Services\\" dated July 2, 2012, candidates for military service shall not have \\"[c]urrent or history of psychosexual conditions, including but not limited to transsexualism, exhibitionism, transvestism, voyeurism, and other paraphilias\\" which is noted as \\"not a contradiction of the repeal of 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell'\\" since homosexuality was removed from the list of psychosexual conditions in DSM in 1973. Sage Fox enlisted in the US Army in 1993 and transitioned to the reserves in 2012. She took time off from the reserves to legally transition physically from male to female. In 2013, she was reactivated and told her commanding officer that she would not return having to claim to be a male. The military could not legally discharge her, so Fox was asked to return and serve again as a woman. This made her the first openly transgender person serving in the military. She served for 2 weeks and then she had orders to be placed on the inactive reserve which she believed was due to her gender identity. She was not granted disability but her medical records did not indicate her unfit to serve. In 2016 Obama repealed transgender ban in the military and Sage Fox was working with the medical board and was expected to be reenlisted. Palm Center panel On March 13, 2014, an advisory panel organized by the Palm Center, a research institute based at San Francisco State University, released a report that found no compelling medical reason for placing limitations on military service by transgender individuals. It said DoD rules that prevented enlistment or continued service by transgender individuals were based on outmoded and untenable ideas about their psychological and physical fitness, and it dismissed concerns about the costs of medical care. It said the DoD's policies could be changed by an executive order. The panel was headed by former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders and Rear Adm. Alan Steinman, a former chief health and safety director for the Coast Guard. It concluded: At the time, service personnel were still being dismissed for being transgender despite their objective job performance. The dismissal policy was based on outdated medical diagnoses which suggested gender nonconformity was a mental illness. In May 2014, Secretary of Defense Hagel said his department's policy with respect to transgender service should be reviewed \\"continually\\". Later in May, the ban on Medicare coverage for gender reassignment surgery, which had been in place since 1981, was lifted in response to a lawsuit filed in 2013 on behalf of Denee Mallon, a 74-year-old transgender Army veteran. With the end of the ban on openly gay service members, Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James stated the ban on transgender personnel \\"is likely to come under review in the next year or so\\" in a December interview. Also in May 2014, the Williams Institute published a research brief estimating 15,500 transgender people were serving on active duty or in the Guard/Reserves, and an additional 134,300 transgender people were either veterans or retired from the Guard/Reserves. The brief was based on a six-month survey of over 6,000 transgender people in 2008‚Äì09 asking (in part) if they had ever served in the armed forces, or had been denied entry because they were transgender. Policy of Secretary Carter In February 2015, during his first trip as United States Secretary of Defense, Dr. Ash Carter was asked about the service of transgender troops, to which he replied: Days later, the White House echoed Secretary Carter's support of transgender service personnel. Starting in March 2015, the Army, Air Force, and Navy issued directives protecting transgender soldiers from dismissal. The Army issued a directive that protected transgender soldiers from being dismissed by mid-level officers by requiring the decision for discharge to be made by the service's top civilian for personnel matters. The Air Force stated that for enlisted airmen, there was no outright grounds for discharge for anyone with gender dysphoria or who identified as transgender, and that a person would only be subject to eviction from the Air Force if his or her condition interfered with their potential deployment or performance on active duty. Navy Secretary Ray Mabus signed a memorandum directed to the chief of Naval operations and commandant of the Marine Corps stating: \\"Effective immediately, separations initiated under the provisions of the reference for service members with a diagnosis or history of gender dysphoria, who identify themselves as transgender, or who have taken steps to externalize the condition, must be forwarded to the assistant secretary of the Navy (manpower and reserve affairs) for decision.\\" L‚ÄìR: Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter, Secretary of the Army John M. McHugh, and Chief of Staff of the Department of Defense Eric Fanning render honors at the LGBT Pride Month ceremony in the Pentagon Auditorium on June 9, 2015. In the wake of these directives, in July 2015, Secretary Carter ordered the creation of a Pentagon working group \\"to study over the next six months the policy and readiness implications of welcoming transgender persons to serve openly.\\" He also stated that all decisions to dismiss troops with gender dysphoria would be handled by the Pentagon's acting Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, Brad Carson. Carson would later resign his position in April 2016 following a February 2016 Senate confirmation hearing where he clashed publicly with Sens. Jim Inhofe [R-OK] and John McCain [R-AZ], but he delivered an implementation plan to allow open service by transgender people for Secretary Carter's review as one of his final accomplishments as acting Undersecretary. Although the working group had a January 2016 deadline to finish evaluating the change, there still was no official policy in place by May 2016, and the Pentagon's acting personnel chief stated it would take \\"months, but not large numbers of months\\" to finalize transgender military service policy details. The American Medical Association approved a resolution opposing the ban on openly transgender troops in June 2015. \\"Transgender Members of the U.S. Military\\" were listed as one of the nine runners-up for Person of the Year by The Advocate in November 2015. The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness asked the RAND National Defense Research Institute to study the implications of transgender service members, including identifying the health care needs of transgender service members, the effect on troop readiness, and the experience of the foreign military forces which allow transgender members to serve openly. RAND estimated in a report published June 2016 that 2,450 active-duty and 1,510 reserve personnel were transgender. Based on the percentage of transgender people seeking gender transition-related medical treatment using private health insurance, RAND further estimated that 29 to 129 active-duty service members would seek transition-related health care benefits per year, increasing military health system costs by 0.13% of the $6 billion military health system annual budget, at a total annual estimated cost of $2.4 to $8.4 million. Readiness was estimated at a decrease of 0.0015% of total available labor-years due to recuperation, and unit cohesion was determined to be minimally affected. The RAND study focused on the service history of transgender personnel in Australia, Canada, Israel, and the United Kingdom, concluding that \\"in no case was there any evidence of an effect on the operational effectiveness, operational readiness, or cohesion of the force.\\" RAND concluded that calling for \\"strong leadership support\\", providing diversity-related \\"education and training to the entire force\\", and developing and enforcing \\"a clear anti-harassment policy\\" were key best practices. The report had been completed in March 2016, and transgender advocates had accused Secretary Carter of delaying its release because it found there were few obstacles to allowing transgender troops to serve openly. A copy of the RAND report was leaked to and published by The New York Times in May 2016. The RAND cost estimate agreed with an earlier study by Dr. Aaron Belkin, who estimated the annual cost of transition-related care would be $5.6 million. On May 23, 2016, the Department of Defense observed the first LGBT Pride Month with openly transgender service members. =End of the ban= Secretary Carter announces the end of the ban on transgender personnel in the United States Military on June 30, 2016 On June 30, 2016, Secretary Ash Carter made an official announcement and published Directive-Type Memo 16-005 (DTM 16-005), declaring: * Effective immediately: ** [N]o otherwise qualified Service member may be involuntarily separated, discharged or denied reenlistment or continuation of service, solely on the basis of their gender identity. ** It is the Department's position, consistent with the U.S. Attorney General's opinion, that discrimination based on gender identity is a form of sex discrimination. * By October 1, 2016: ** A training handbook will be developed and published for transgender Service members, commanders, the force, and medical professionals. In addition, guidance will be published for medical care and treatment of transgender Service members. ** Transgender Service members will be allowed to transition gender while serving in accordance with Department of Defense Instruction 1300.28 (also published on June 30). ** \\"The Military Health System will be required to provide transgender Service members with all medically necessary care related to gender transition, based on the guidance that is issued.\\" * By November 1, 2016: ** Implementing guidance and a training and education plan will be issued by each branch of the military, including a scheduled completion date. * By July 1, 2017: ** Training of the force regarding transgender Service members shall be completed. ** The process of accession (entrance to military service, through enlistment, Service Academies, ROTC, or any similar program) will be opened to transgender individuals, provided they meet the same physical and mental fitness standards as any other applicant. ** The initial accession policy requires \\"an individual to have completed any medical treatment that their doctor has determined is necessary in connection with their gender transition, and to have been stable in their preferred gender for 18 months, as certified by their doctor, before they can enter the military.\\" The Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction 1300.28, \\"In-service transition for transgender service members\\", published on June 30, 2016, provided administrative and medical guidance for currently-serving military personnel seeking gender transition. On September 20, 2016, a commander's training handbook was published by the Department of Defense, along with a medical protocol and guidance to change a service member's gender, entitled \\"Transgender Service in the U.S. Military\\". On October 3, 2016, non-active duty service members became eligible for the Military Health System to provide behavioral health care and hormone treatments, but not sex reassignment surgery. On October 26, 10 soldiers in the United States Army became the first to openly petition for a sex change. Also on October 26, the Department of Defense ruled that any form of discrimination against transgender youth was incompatible with an Executive Order issued by then US President Bill Clinton in the year 2000 which directed federal agencies that conduct educational activities to comply with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and issued a memorandum ordering military youth schools to immediately comply with the 2000 Executive Order. CMDCM Craig Cole conduct mandatory Navy transgender policy training at the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island (January 10, 2017; photograph by Ezra Elliott) On October 16, 2016, the United States Air Force published its official guidance policy for transgender individuals. The policy announced their support of transgender airmen and that any bias against them would not be tolerated. This allowed transgender individuals to openly serve in the Air Force, along with outlawing any discharge or denying reenlistment based solely on gender identity. The policy also provided medical protocol and assistance for any service member that wished to change their identity. The United States Army also followed suit and issued its guidance policy for transgender individuals on November 1. On November 7, 2016, the Navy released its official guidance policy for transgender individuals. The policy allowed any individual regardless of race, gender, or sexual orientation to become a sailor if they can meet Navy standards. Current Navy sailors can transition genders with a diagnosis from a military medical provider stating that the transition is medically necessary for the individual. Policy was adjusted to increase facility privacy and urinalysis protocol. The protocol for physical readiness was unchanged. On November 10, 2016, 55 sailors in the United States Navy and 48 airpersons in the United States Air Force publicly petitioned for their respective gender confirmation surgeries. On November 29, 2016, the United States Department of Defense Directive 1350.2, the United States Department of Defense Military Equal Opportunity Program, is updated to include gender identity. =Policy Under Donald Trump= On February 25, 2017, the Military Times learned that some time after Trump was sworn into the presidency, Defense Department schools stopped enforcing an October 26, 2016 Department of Defense ruling that any form of discrimination against transgender youth was incompatible with an Executive Order issued by U.S. President Bill Clinton in 2000, which directed federal agencies that conduct educational activities to comply with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and issued a memorandum ordering military youth schools to immediately comply with the 2000 Executive Order. In April 2017, President Trump nominated Army veteran and Tennessee State Senator Dr. Mark Green as his second choice for Secretary of the Army. Green was criticized for prior remarks he had made before the Chattanooga Tea Party in September 2016, including his statement that \\"if you poll the psychiatrists, they're going to tell you that transgender is a disease.\\" Green withdrew his nomination in May amid strong opposition to his nomination from LGBT advocates, among others, including Daniel Feehan, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Readiness under the Obama administration, who said Green's prior statements were of \\"great concern towards military readiness\\" and could immediately impact unit cohesion. On May 16, 2017, a letter that was signed by dozens of right-leaning groups pushed for banning transgender individuals from the United States military. On June 2, 2017, the Department of Defense observed the first LGBT Pride Month since the repeal of the ban on open military service by transgender service members in the US military, however there were openly transgender service members when the Department of Defense observed the 2016 LGBT Pride Month. The one-year review period prior to allowing accession of transgender individuals was due by July 1, 2017 per DTM 16-005, but Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis issued a memo to delay the start of accessions for an additional six months, stating the \\"additional time [will be used] to evaluate more carefully the impact of such accessions on readiness and lethality.\\" Military leaders had asked for a delay on the start of accessions, ranging from one to two years.  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 The office of Representative Vicky Hartzler (R-MO) provided an estimate of $1.3 billion in health care costs for transgender service personnel, assuming a higher number of active-duty personnel based on the 2014 Williams Institute study, which concluded that approximately 15,500 active-duty and guard/reserve service personnel were transgender. The $1.3 billion estimate also assumed an average of 30% of transgender personnel would seek gender reassignment surgery per year at an average cost of $132,000 per surgery. However, in the Australian military's experience, only 13 troops (out of a total full-time force of 58,000) had sought gender reassignment surgery over a 30-month period; applying that rate to the United States military population gave an estimate of 192 gender reassignment surgeries in the United States military per year, which makes the surgery request rate 1.2% of the 15,500 estimated transgender service personnel from the 2014 Williams Institute study. In a subsequent interview, Hartzler stated \\"our own office did that analysis and we feel very confident in it.\\" Hartzler first proposed an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 (NDAA) in late June 2017 which would honorably discharge transgender military personnel serving openly, but withdrew the amendment after Secretary Mattis announced the six-month delay while the effect on troop readiness and lethality were being studied. During the debate on the amendment, Representative and Marine Corps veteran Duncan D. Hunter (R-CA) stated he couldn't imagine showering with \\"somebody who was a girl and didn't have the surgery to become a man but kept the girl stuff\\", an argument rejected by Representative Donald McEachin (D-VA), who pointed out that similar arguments were made years ago opposing the integration of the armed forces. \\"I can imagine, not these individuals, not my colleagues to my right, but a Congress 70 or 80 years ago that said that a certain group of people weren't smart enough to fly airplanes. That they'd run at the first sign of battle. That African-Americans could not serve in the United States Armed Forces. Well, African-Americans proved them wrong. The unit adapted. And I'd suggest that the unit adapt to transgender individuals as well.\\" On July 13, 2017, Rep. Vicky Hartzler introduced House Amendment 183, an amendment to ban on funding gender reassignment surgeries and medical treatments for transgender military personnel via a new amendment to the NDAA in July 2017, which was voted down 209‚Äì214 when 24 moderate Republicans joined Democrats in opposing the \\"blatantly discriminatory\\" proposal. Before the vote, Secretary Mattis called Hartzler to ask her to withdraw the amendment. After the amendment was defeated, Representative Trent Franks (R-AZ) stated \\"it seems to me, and all due respect to everyone, that if someone wants to come to the military, potentially risk their life to save the country, that they should probably decide whether they're a man or woman before they do that.\\" Conservatives subsequently attempted to insert a provision banning the funding in the rules governing a Pentagon spending package, but were pressured to drop that attempt in order to prevent circumvention of regular order. Republican House leaders went to the White House to petition them for help on the issue of the Pentagon funding gender reassignment surgeries. Chief strategist Steve Bannon encouraged Trump to deal with the matter now and played a role in pushing Trump to move ahead with banning transgender individuals from the military, despite the ongoing Pentagon review. Service ban announcement by the President On July 26, 2017, President Donald Trump announced on his Twitter page that transgender individuals would no longer be allowed \\"to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military\\". According to Politico and a senior administration official, President Trump had always planned to ban transgender individuals from the military and prohibit the Pentagon funding gender reassignment surgeries, but the fight over prohibiting Pentagon funding gender reassignment surgeries had hastened Trump‚Äôs decision. According to numerous congressional and White House sources, the tweet was a last-ditch attempt to save a $1.6 billion in border wall funding provision in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018. > After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised > that the United States Government will not accept or allow Transgender > individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military. Our military must > be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with > the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military > would entail. Thank you. Trump cited his consultation with \\"Generals and military experts\\" for his conclusion that the military \\"cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail\\", contradicting the conclusions of the 2016 RAND study. Political commentator Richard Kim observed President Trump's tweets were \\"a sop to the far-right evangelical faction\\" in the House of Representatives led by Hartzler, who had threatened the funding for President Trump's planned United States-Mexico border wall if the military continued to spend health care funds for medical treatment of gender dysphoria. Due to the haste of the announcement, White House officials were unable to answer questions on how the proposed ban would be implemented, or what would happen to those personnel who were openly transgender. Secretary Mattis was only notified about the announcement on July 25. Similarly, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Joseph Dunford noted his surprise at the announcement, saying that \\"When asked, I will state I was not consulted\\" in emails dated July 27, 2017 leaked to BuzzFeed News in February 2018. The New York Times noted that the move also marked \\"a stark turnabout for Mr. Trump, who billed himself during the campaign as an ally of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people.\\" According to Johnnie Moore, who was present, Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council first proposed a ban on transgender personnel in the military at a mid-July meeting held between Trump-Pence administration officials and religious leaders, but the proposal did not receive universal support from attendees. After the president's tweets, Hartzler stated in an interview that \\"this was the right call by our commander in chief, to make sure every defense dollar goes toward meeting the threats that we are facing in the world ... [T]he entire policy ... is a detriment to our readiness.\\" The 'Stop Transgender Military Ban' rally outside the White House was held July 29, 2017 The announced reinstatement of the ban was followed by protests in New York City, Washington DC, and San Francisco on July 26, 2017, and a rally was held in front of the White House on July 29. As Trump had not yet outlined specific policy changes, Chairman Dunford announced on July 27, 2017, that \\"there will be no modifications to the current policy until the president's direction has been received by the secretary of defense and the secretary has issued implementation guidance.\\" Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) introduced an amendment to NDAA on July 27, 2017, which would prohibit the involuntary discharge, cessation of health care benefits, or changes in responsibility or position (other than promotion, routine reassignment, or deployment) of transgender troops until sixty days after Congress received the results of the six-month study proposed by Secretary Mattis. On August 1, 2017, the Palm Center released a letter signed by 56 retired generals and admirals, opposing the proposed ban on transgender military service members. The letter stated that if implemented, the ban \\"would cause significant disruptions, deprive the military of mission-critical talent and compromise the integrity of transgender troops who would be forced to live a lie, as well as non- transgender peers who would be forced to choose between reporting their comrades or disobeying policy\\". The commandant of the United States Coast Guard, Admiral Paul F. Zukunft, made a personal commitment to \\"not turn my back ... not break faith\\" with transgender service members in the Coast Guard on August 1, 2017. At the time, it was noted the Coast Guard was part of the Department of Homeland Security, not the Department of Defense, and it was not clear how the proposed ban on transgender service members would affect the Coast Guard. Presidential Memorandum (August 25, 2017) Presidential Memorandum of August 25, 2017 In late August, a memorandum was being prepared which would require Secretary Mattis to enforce the ban on transgender personnel within six months. An anonymous source familiar with the contents of the memo stated it will expel serving transgender personnel if they are unable to deploy, bar recruitment of transgender soldiers, and end payments for medical care associated with gender dysphoria, including gender reassignment surgery. Aaron Belkin, director of the Palm Center, criticized the forthcoming memo for imposing a double standard on transgender troops, calling it \\"a recipe for disruption, distraction, and waste\\". On August 25, 2017, President Trump signed a presidential memorandum identifying the guidelines for renewing the ban. In the memo, President Trump stated the ban on transgender personnel in the military will remain effective until \\"the Secretary of Defense, after consulting with the Secretary of Homeland Security, provides a recommendation to the contrary that I find convincing\\", ignoring the conclusions of the 2016 RAND study, and further called for a \\"halt [to] all use of DoD or DHS resources to fund sex reassignment surgical procedures for military personnel\\", effective March 23, 2018. The memo further required the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of Homeland Security to submit an implementation plan by February 21, 2018. Senator Tammy Duckworth [D-IL] and Representative Nancy Pelosi [D-CA] released separate statements condemning the memorandum; Pelosi stated the memo directed \\"the Pentagon to hurt and humiliate\\" transgender service personnel and questioned whether \\"prejudice, not the national defense\\" was motivating the action. Two weeks before sending his directive to the Pentagon, Trump said, \\"I think I'm doing the military a great favor\\" by banning trans military members. Representative Donald McEachin (D-VA) was the lead author of a letter to Secretary Mattis on October 10, 2017, requesting records of discussions or correspondence between the White House and the Pentagon that would document or justify that Trump was \\"doing the military a great favor\\", including any substantiation of requests for a ban on transgender soldiers originating from senior military or Department of Defense personnel. The letter, which questioned \\"whether the president, his national security team, and military leaders are actively coordinating policy with one another, or whether the president's transgender ban announcement reflected a breakdown in communication\\", was co-signed by 114 other Democratic Representatives. On August 29, 2017, Secretary Mattis announced that currently serving transgender troops would be allowed to remain in the armed services, pending further study. Mattis stated he would set up a panel of experts from the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security to provide recommendations on implementing the President's policy direction. Secretary Mattis formalized the interim policy in an interim guidance issued on September 18, 2017. The interim guidance, which expires no later than February 21, 2018, essentially freezes the policies that were in place before the Presidential Memorandum of August 25. Accession of transgender individuals is still banned per the procedures dated April 28, 2010. Transgender soldiers will not be denied reenlistment, and may not be involuntarily discharged solely on the basis of their gender identity. Medical treatment will continue for service members with a gender dysphoria diagnosis, with the exception that no new sex reassignment surgeries will be permitted after March 22, 2018 unless necessary to protect the health of an individual who has already begun treatment. Mattis named the Deputy Secretary of Defense, Patrick M. Shanahan, and the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Paul Selva, to head the advisory panel of experts tasked with providing recommendations. Despite the Interim Guidance, the Presidential Memorandum has attracted significant legal and legislative opposition: * Jane Doe v. Trump, a lawsuit filed by GLAD and NCLR on August 9, 2017. A preliminary injunction against the Presidential Memorandum was granted in part on October 30, 2017, but the court vacated this injunction on January 4, 2019. (Injunctions granted by other courts remained in effect.) * Stone v. Trump, a lawsuit filed by the ACLU of Maryland on August 28, 2017. Judge Marvin J. Garbis granted a preliminary injunction against the Presidential Memorandum in full on November 21, 2017. * Karnoski v. Trump, a lawsuit filed by Lambda Legal on August 28, 2017. A preliminary injunction against the Presidential Memorandum was granted in full on December 11, 2017. * Stockman v. Trump, a lawsuit filed by Equality California on September 5, 2017. A preliminary injunction against the Presidential Memorandum was granted in full on December 22, 2017. * (September 15, 2017) and (October 12, 2017), bipartisan bills in the Senate and House, respectively, to prohibit the involuntary separation or denial of re- enlistment of military personnel solely on the basis of gender identity. Military pays for one (1) surgery In November 2017, the Defense Health Agency for the first time approved payment for sex reassignment surgery for an active-duty U.S. military service member. The patient, an infantry soldier who identifies as a woman, had already begun a course of treatment for gender reassignment. The procedure, which the treating doctor deemed medically necessary, was performed on November 14 at a private hospital, since military hospitals lack the requisite surgical expertise. Accession of transgender individuals The accession of transgender individuals was scheduled to be allowed by July 1, 2017, per DTM 16-005, but military leaders asked for a one to two-year delay on accessions, stating more time was needed to review entrance standards and to ensure the success of transgender individuals. In response, Secretary Mattis issued a six-month delay on accessions. With Judge Kollar-Kotelly's decision on October 30, 2017, to enjoin the Presidential Memorandum of August 25, the accession policy reverts to the six-month delay, and the accession of transgender individuals into military service is set to begin on January 1, 2018. Because Secretary Mattis had previously delayed accession by six months in June, the United States Department of Justice Civil Division filed a motion for clarification asking if Secretary Mattis had independent authority to modify DTM 16-005. In a November 27, 2017 order, Judge Kollar-Kotelly stated \\"Any action by any of the Defendants that changes this status quo is preliminarily enjoined.\\" As a named defendant, Secretary Mattis does not have authority to change the preliminary injunction order of October 30, which reverts policy to the status quo prior to the Presidential Memorandum of August 25, and accessions are set to start on January 1, 2018. On December 11, Judge Kollar-Kotelly denied the motion for partial stay, noting it took three weeks for USDOJ to file the first appeal, and that she \\"would have expected Defendants to act with more alacrity\\" if the January 1, 2018 deadline for accession was unmanageable. USDOJ filed for emergency stays with the D.C. Circuit (on December 11, for Doe), the Fourth Circuit (on December 14, for Stone), and the Ninth Circuit (on December 15, for Karnoski), seeking to either allow Secretary Mattis to institute a second delay on accession, or narrowing the scope of the injunction to allow accession of only those individuals ruled to have standing. On December 21, 2017, a panel of three judges on the Fourth Circuit denied USDOJ's emergency motion for a stay on Judge Garbis's order. The next day, a panel of three judges on the D.C. Circuit also denied the USDOJ emergency stay motion on Judge Kollar-Kotelly's order. On December 29, USDOJ filed to withdraw their appeal from the Ninth Circuit, which was granted. Beginning on January 1, 2018, transgender individuals were allowed to join the U.S. military if a licensed medical provider certified that the applicant completed all medical treatment associated with gender transition, has been stable in the preferred gender for 18 months, and if the applicant has completed sex reassignment or genital reconstruction surgery, that 18 months have elapsed since the most recent surgery, no functional limitations or complications persist, and no additional surgeries are required. In February 2018, the Pentagon confirmed that, for the first time, a transgender recruit had signed a contract to enter the U.S. military, joining an estimated 4,000 already serving. Mattis recommendations and report The Presidential Memorandum of August 25, 2017 required Defense Secretary Mattis to provide his recommendations to the President no later than February 21, 2018, but the meeting was postponed. On February 22, The Washington Post reported that Mattis was set to recommend that transgender sailors and soldiers be allowed to continue serving in the military, according to anonymous officials familiar with Mattis's plans. Also on February 22, in Karnoski v. Trump, a motion was filed to compel disclosure as prior documents filed by USDOJ stated the \\"'new policy' on transgender service\\" would be released on February 21. * \\"Transgender persons with a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria are disqualified from military service, except under the following limited circumstances:\\" The memorandum providing the recommendations from Mattis, dated February 22, 2018, was released March 23 alongside the supporting report in a document filed for Karnoski v. Trump. Mattis explained he had formed \\"a Panel of Experts senior uniformed and civilian Defense Department and U.S. Coast Guard leaders\\" to \\"provide its best military advice, based on increasing the lethality and readiness of America's armed forces\\", which authored the report attached to the Mattis memorandum. The Panel was convened on September 14, 2017, and met 13 times over a span of 90 days. The names of those on the Panel were not released, but membership was stated by role to include \\"the Under Secretaries of the Military Departments (or officials performing their duties), the Armed Services' Vice Chiefs (including the Vice Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard), and the Senior Enlisted Advisors\\". Meetings were led \\"by the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness or an official performing those duties\\". That leadership post was held by Anthony Kurta during the majority of the Panel's tenure until Robert Wilkie was sworn in during November 2017. Anonymous sources stated that Vice President Mike Pence, Ryan T. Anderson (a research fellow at the Heritage Foundation and author of When Harry Became Sally: Responding to the Transgender Moment), and Tony Perkins (leader of the Family Research Council) led the creation of that report. In summary, Mattis recommended: * \\"Transgender persons with a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria are disqualified from military service, except under the following limited circumstances: > *# 36 consecutive months of stability \\"in their biological sex prior to > accession\\" *# For currently serving personnel who are diagnosed with gender > dysphoria after accession, \\"if they do not require a change of gender and > remain deployable\\" they may continue to serve. *# For currently serving > personnel who were diagnosed with gender dysphoria under the previous policy > (outlined by Ash Carter) and prior to the effective date of the new policy, > they may continue to serve \\"in their preferred gender and receive medically > necessary treatment for gender dysphoria\\" * \\"Transgender persons who require > or have undergone gender transition are disqualified from military service.\\" > * \\"Transgender persons without a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria, > who are otherwise qualified for service, may serve, like all other Service > members, in their biological sex.\\" The Mattis memorandum criticized the > prior RAND report, stating \\"It referred to limited and heavily caveated data > to support its conclusions, glossed over the impacts of healthcare costs, > readiness, and unit cohesion, and erroneously relied on the selective > experiences of foreign militaries with different operational requirements > than our own.\\" However, it was also reported that unlike Trump, Mattis > preferred to keep transgender people in the military.

The concert was held at Althorp Park, the Northamptonshire seat of the Spencer family, and Diana's childhood home. Artists and groups who performed at the concert were among those enjoyed by the late Princess, and included Cliff Richard, Chris de Burgh, David Hasselhoff, Duran Duran, Jimmy Ruffin, Lesley Garrett and Lawrence Gowan. The concert was attended by 15,000 people, with proceeds from ticket sales being donated to the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund, but the ¬£39.50 price attracted criticism due to its perceived expense. Phil Collins, who did not appear at the concert, was among those to comment on the amount charged to concertgoers. Highlights of the concert were broadcast on BBC One on the evening of 1 July. The idea of holding a concert at the Althorp estate was conceived by Earl Spencer, and details were first revealed in January 1998, shortly after it had been announced that Althorp would be opened to the public for the first time. The concert would feature a lineup of artists and groups from the worlds of classical music, pop and rock, all genres liked by the late Princess. The lineup was announced on 27 February, with tickets going on sale the following day. Two thirds of the tickets had sold out by the end of February, but BBC News reported they had not sold out as quickly as anticipated, prompting Collins to highlight what he believed to be their high cost in a radio interview. Althorp Park was opened to the public a few days after the concert, with an entrance fee of ¬£9.00. Visitors were invited to view an exhibition of the Princess's life and works. This remained open until 30 August, the day before the first anniversary of her death.

The Nationale Jeugdstorm (English: National Youth Storm; NJS) was a Dutch youth movement associated with the National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands (NSB) that existed from 1934 to 1945, organized as the Dutch equivalent of the German Hitlerjugend and as a Nazi counterpart of Scouting Nederland. Formation The organization was formally separate, but had very close links with the NSB. The director was the leading NSB member Cornelis van Geelkerken. On May 1, 1934, Van Geelkerken was dismissed as a government official because NSB membership was deemed incompatible with employment with the government. On that same day, he founded the Nationale Jeugdstorm. On February 1, 1936, the Nationale Jeugdstorm was shut down as a result of a Supreme Court ruling. An immediate restructuring followed, with a new 'democratic' organisation and a small name change (Vereniging Nationale Jeugdstorm, VNJ). Soon after the German invasion, the old name was re-adopted. Nearly all members of the Nationale Jeugdstorm were children of NSB members.Verzetsmuseum Amsterdam Before the occupation, the Nationale Jeugdstorm had around 2,000 members; a number that increased during WWII to over 12,000. Members were between 10 and 17 years old, and had to be Dutch. The members called meeuwen (seagulls) and meeuwkes (gulls) (10‚Äì13 years) and stormers and stormsters (stormers) (14‚Äì17 years). Boys and girls formed separate groups within the organization. When they became 18, the boys were conscripted to the Nederlandse Arbeidsdienst (Dutch Labour Service) (NAD) or the Waffen SS.

She is the founder and CEO of Hint Water, a flavored water brand founded in 2005.  Early life  She was born Kara Ellen Keenan, a daughter of William and Kay Keenan of Tempe, Arizona. Her father worked for Con-Agra, and then for Armour & Company in Phoenix, where he retired as the general manager for distribution, and her mother worked at a local department store. She is the youngest of five children. Goldin grew up in Scottsdale, Arizona, after moving there from Minneapolis when she was three years of age. Goldin majored in communications and minored in finance at Arizona State University, graduating in 1989. Career After graduating in 1989 from ASU, she moved to New York City, after accepting her first job out of college at Time Inc. Goldin worked in circulation at Time Inc. for three years. She started out as an executive assistant and worked her way up to managing the airline circulation for the Time Inc. publications. She then moved on to work in advertising sales at CNN. Following her move to San Francisco, Goldin began working for a start-up called 2Market, a spin-out of Apple pursuing a computer-based shopping idea that Steve Jobs developed. She was given the position of National Sales Manager for two years until the company was bought out by AOL. Goldin then began working in e-commerce for AOL as the Vice President of Shopping and E-commerce Partnerships while her husband worked for Netscape. In this position she grew AOL‚Äôs e-commerce and shopping business to about a billion dollars in revenue. When AOL acquired Netscape in 2001, Kara decided to take a step back from this field of work and focus on raising her family. After having three children, Goldin realized that she wanted to spend her time creating and living a healthy lifestyle. She had trouble losing the additional baby weight and came upon the realization that everything she was drinking was sugary, unhealthy, and artificially sweetened. Goldin then took this idea and launched Hint in 2005 in San Francisco as a healthy alternative to the sugary, artificially sweetened drinks she had been consuming. Hint Water is flavored solely with natural fruit. In the 12 years since its creation, Hint Water has become an asset of the break rooms of some of Silicon Valley‚Äôs highest-profile companies, including Google, Facebook and LinkedIn. Hint Fizz carbonated beverage was launched in 2011 and in 2017, Hint began to market sunscreen. Following her work and creation of Hint, Goldin wanted to share her experiences as an entrepreneur with the world. She created The Kara Network as a place for fellow entrepreneurs to reach out and tell their stories as well as provide some helpful insight to those who were interested in following a similar path. Kara‚Äôs first job was at age 14 working for a local toy store, Alphabet Toys in Scottsdale where after a few weeks, she was asked to help with buying for the entire store. Kara credits this experience with launching her on the path to entrepreneurship.  Personal life  Right before she began working with CNN, Goldin met her husband, Theo Goldin, who at the time was in law school at New York University. They married in 1995 at the Wrigley Mansion in Phoenix, Arizona. They moved to San Francisco when Theo graduated and they were married shortly after. They have four children together.

It is Leather's fourth novel and was adapted into a film, starring Jackie Chan, titled The Foreigner, released in 2017. The plot concerns a Vietnamese London restaurateur and skilled Vietnam War veteran who travels to Ireland to hunt the people responsible for a bombing that killed his family. Plot Nguyen Ngoc Minh is a Vietnamese London restaurateur, and Vietnam war veteran who was trained as an assassin by both the Viet Cong and the US Army. One day he loses both his wife and daughter in a bombing by the Irish Republican Army (IRA). He seeks justice, first by going to London Chief Inspector Richard Bromley, but is rebuffed. In the meantime, a rogue cell of IRA continues to commit the bombings throughout London. Ian \\"Woody\\" Wood is a freelance journalist, who was on the incident after the bombings, is asked to investigate the IRA. He is approached by the desperate Nguyen, who offers a money reward for the names of the bombers. Woody, who does not have enough information, suggests that Nguyen talk to Sinn Fein member and former IRA operator, Liam Hennessey. Meanwhile, Bromley continues investigating the bombings occurring around London. Nguyen, determined on getting the names, sells his restaurant to his best friend and decides to travel to Belfast to talk to Hennessey. Hennessey decides to have his former weapon dumps investigated, believing the rogue cell is using Semtex from those dumps to create the explosives. Nguyen buys chemicals, camping utilities and a combat weapons, which reminds him of the time of the war. He travels to Belfast and confronts Henessey for the names but is turned down, prompting Nguyen to set off a homemade bomb in the bathroom of Hennessey's office. By phone Nguyen threatens further reprisals if he is not given the names of the bombers. Hennessey, secretly having ordered the bombings to boost his political needs, is in fact enraged that civilians were killed and that the bombings came without warnings. He contacts his associate in the United States, Sean Morrison, to come to London and talk to Bromley about a plan to take down the bombers. Morrison meets Bromley in London and tells him about their plan, of which only the two of them will harbor knowledge. Nguyen decides to take the fight to Hennessey, by setting off bombs on his farm prompting him to send his wife Mary, who is secretly having an affair with Morrisson, to London and send his men after Nguyen, who is positioned in the forest nearby. Nguyen, lethally skilled in jungle warfare, disables Hennessey's men with traps and fighting them off before escaping into the forest. When another bombing occurs, Hennessey's plan fails to pin the bombers. Elsewhere, Woody forms a relationship with a woman named Maggie, who is secretly part of the cell and the relationship is a ruse to plan the next bombing, in which planning a bomb on a royal flight which Woody is boarding for a press conference, while deciding to publish his story about his meeting with The Chinaman. Desperate to put an end to Nguyen, Hennessey hires a tracker, who is the daughter of a close friend and former IRA associate. Hennessey discovers that the person behind the bombings is his political enforcer Hugh McGarth and discover Morrison and Mary's affair, deducing that Mary and McGarth were responsible for the rogue cell, but decides to let Morrison off the hook to help in hunting down Nguyen. The rogue cell members successfully plant the bomb in the form of a laptop which is given to Woody by Maggie. Morrison and Hennessey interrogate McGarth for the names of the bombers, before executing him. In flashback, the story reveals that Nguyen fought for the Viet Cong during the Vietnam War before joining the United States Army, which trained him in unarmed combat and jungle warfare. He was refused asylum in America before deciding to escape to Hong Kong, witnessing his eldest daughters raped and killed by Thai pirates. Morrison, the tracker, and Hennesey's right-hand man, Kavanagh, begin the hunt for Nguyen. The manhunt concludes with the death of Kavanagh and three other enforcers at the hands of Nguyen, and a confrontation between the latter and Morrison, which ends with Morrison giving the names of the bombers to Nguyen. In London, Bromley is relayed the names and location of the bombers by Hennessey. A Special Air Service (SAS) team led by The Colonel and an operative codenamed Joker converge on the building in which the bombers are residing. Nguyen manages to enter first disguised as a delivery man and armed with a replica of an AK-47 rifle. As the SAS team positions itself in the building, Nguyen arrives at the apartment and ambushes the bombers after Maggie fails to warn them after reading about him from Woody's story. At the airport, Woody boards the plane with the bomb in his case, unbeknownst to him. The SAS team bursts into the apartment and guns down everyone, including Nguyen, though not Maggie. They fail to stop the bomb in time, which detonates, killing Woody and everyone aboard. Bromley, wanting no loose ends, has Maggie executed. During a meeting about taking down the IRA, Hennessey and Morrison's names are brought up. Bromley decides not to mention Nguyen, knowing the life and death of the Chinaman will always be a mystery. History Leather wrote the novel while working as night news editor on the business desk of The Times in London. At the time, the Provisional Irish Republican Army's bombing campaign was at its height.

The presence of the digital divide is due to several factors that include age, location, and wealth, all of which can contribute to the gap in availability of information communication technology (ICT). Malaysia is not a fully developed country, which has led some researchers to express concern that the limited access to ICT may cause the country to fall even further behind in the progress of worldwide technology if this issue is not addressed and mended.  Causes of the digital divide in Malaysia  The digital divide in Malaysia is not a single cause and single effect problem. Factors contributing to the Digital Divide can be found in multiple categories and/or demographics within Malaysia. These can include factors such as age, education, wealth, and location, among others. Age, in respects to young vs. elderly, are a small factor when looking at the widespread lack of ICT (and capable users of such technology) within Malaysia. It is a pre-dominantly known fact throughout much of the world that most older generations have less experience with technology in general, which further reinforces that young age vs. old age may be a factor in digital divide, but not specific to Malaysia. Though the elderly are recognized as one of several groups venerable to being lost to technology, the aging population is not the main focus when looking at bridging the digital divide in Malaysia. Location within the country, along with the wealth surrounding certain areas, however, play a larger role in either bridging or creating the digital divide in Malaysia. Overall broadband penetration rate for the entire country was measured at 67.2%, averaged. However, in highly populated and more wealthy areas, that rate jumps up to 115.7% at its highest difference. This shows a measurable neglect to urban areas in need of ICT. Out of a collective 8,500 primary and secondary schools in Malaysia, most of these are location in rural areas. Because the factors contributing to the digital divide in Malaysia overlap each other so commonly, this neglect to bridge the gap of digital technology and usage in the urban areas, particularly, further contributes to the digital divide. This is a problem that is beginning to be addressed by several means of mending discussed in a later section of this article. Education as a cause of the digital divide is an extremely important factor of the digital divide and one that Malaysia appears to be the most fixated on mending. A more detailed explanation of how education is affecting the digital divide in Malaysia follows in a subsequent section.  Effect of education  One of the most prominent causes of the digital divide in Malaysia is education because there is a great disparity in the education level of Malaysian citizens. This is due in part to the lack of computer education programs prior to 1991, when Vision 2020 was initiated by the Malaysian government. Vision 2020 was initiated to try to increase computer usage skills among Malaysian citizens. Since Vision 2020 was not started until 1991, this means there is a large group of Malaysian citizens who grew up prior to 1991 who have never been exposed to computer literacy education. Schools in many of Malaysia's rural areas also did not have access to computers of the internet before this program was implemented. In addition to lack of formal computer education in much of the Malaysian population, it has been shown that people with lower levels of general education are also less likely to be comfortable using computers. Shaffril stated in his article \\"Socio-economic factors that impinge computer usage in administration works among village leaders in Malaysia\\" that less educated people will have less opportunity to have a better job, resulting in a lower income and subsequent reduced ability to purchase, use, or become familiar with computer usage. Such factors further increase the digital divide in Malaysia. Because people who are educated are more likely to use computers, they have more opportunity to increase their knowledge through computer usage through things like online classes, digital databases, or other learning resources. A study done by Shaheen Majid at the International Islamic University Malaysia found that there is direct relationship between people's highest level of education and their use of online learning resources. The higher an individual had gotten in their schooling, the more likely they were to use these resources to further their education. This results in citizens who are more familiar with computers increasing their computer use, and those unfamiliar with computers being less able to increase their computer skills, serving to widen the digital divide rather than leave it unaffected or reduce it. There are various plans and initiatives in place to make computer literacy and computer training workshops available to less computer educated members of Malaysian society; notably, the government initiative Vision 2020, which aims to have all members of Malaysian society familiar with Information and Communications Technology (ICT) by the year 2020. There have also been smaller programs such as the Eighth Malaysian Plan in 2001 which collaborated with village committees to begin a nationwide computer literacy program for rural areas. This program established various locations where Malaysian citizens who otherwise would not have access to computers could be introduced to computers.  Working to mend the digital divide in Malaysia  There are metaphorical roadblocks in reaching those who do not have access to internet or communication within Malaysia. Despite this, Malaysian government has been working for years to incorporate more Telecentres, general broadband accessibility, and the role of technology within schools. Telecentres work as hubs of information and serve a vital role in the task of improving connectivity in Malaysia. A Telecentre may provide more than just access to the internet; Telecentres also provide education on how to utilize ICT, exposure to new technologies, and helps to connect urban and rural areas. Malaysian officials have recognized the importance and impact of Telecentres and have implemented at least 2,150 of the technology-rich centers throughout Malaysia. Broadband accessibility and penetration is another focus within the issue. The average percentage of a community with broadband access sits at a relatively low 67.2%.This percentage fluctuates greatly when looking at highly populated, urban areas (such as Kuala Lumpur at 115.7%) or at scarcely populated, rural areas (Sabah boasts a measly 52.8% broadband penetration rate). In 2009, a High Speed Broadband Project was introduced to improve broadband reach, and speeds, within Malaysia. At that time, the broadband penetration rate was under 50% across the country and the project's goal was to raise the broadband penetration rate to above that. As seen above, with the current broadband penetration rate at 52.8%, the project did reach its goal. Official organizations have also placed an emphasis on incorporating technology into schools in Malaysia, particularly because most Malaysian schools are found in rural areas. Malaysia presents one of the highest literacy rates in the world, but still faces a shortage of technological access within schools. Programs such as The Mobile Internet Unit (MIU), which provides internet access and ICT education to various schools that it visits, are focusing on introducing school children to the power, role, and workings of ICT so that they are better prepared to assist in bringing ICT to Malaysia in the future.

Pre-war service  Lee- Barber joined the Royal Navy in 1919 and served in the Far East on a gunboat on the Yangtse river.  Second World War  At the beginning of the Second World War, ships of Griffins type were ill equipped to deal with air attack. This is borne out by HMS Griffin being the only survivor of a flotilla of nine ships. = 1940 = In February 1940, he had to have an operation on his stomach in February 1940. Lee-Barber was allowed back to his duties on a condition of living a teetotal lifestyle. He attributed his long life to his abstinence from alcohol that he began then. Lee-Barber was mentioned in despatches for his work in landing and subsequently evacuating troops from Namsos in northern Norway. The bridge crew of HMS Griffin became adept at dodging attacks by Luftwaffe Stuka dive bombers during the campaign. Later, when based at Dover and protecting convoys, Griffin avoided 36 air attacks by Dornier Do 17 aircraft. The island of Texel off the coast of the Netherlands and the French coastline were the next area of conflict for Griffin. They were acting in support of the Allied armies facing the German invasion of France and the Low Countries. The ship missed the Dunkirk evacuation due to undergoing a refit at Devonport. However, the ship did lift Polish troops from the French port of St Nazaire, an act which earned Lee-Barber the Polish Cross of Valour. HMS Griffin was then despatched to join Force H at Gibraltar. In this theatre Lee-Barber participated in the Battle of Cape Matapan and the Malta convoys. His actions in at this time earned him the first award of the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) in July 1940. = 1941 = Lee-Barber was promoted to Commander in June 1941 and participated in the Greece Campaign.

HMS Griffin also received a message of congratulations from commander of the Mediterranean Fleet, Admiral Andrew Cunningham. Griffin went on to bombard Vichy French positions at Haifa and Sidon. The ship also acted in support of the garrison during the Siege of Tobruk. Lee-Barber would take supplies in to the troops, running the gauntlet of U-boats and having to unload all supplies in 40 minutes. This timeframe allowed the ship to get back under the protective Royal Air Force (RAF) air umbrella by dawn. After this busy service Lee-Barber was posted to a land based job in army liaison in the Home Counties in late 1941. = 1942‚Äì44 = After serving in the UK Lee-Barber was given another sea command with HMS Opportune. He was with the ship when it took part in the Battle of the North Cape which resulted the sinking of the German battleship . Lee-Barber was mentioned in despatches for a second time for his actions during the battle.  Post War service  After the end of the war Lee- Barber's service continued in destroyers, culminating in command of the 4th Destroyer Squadron. Promoted to Captain he was posted as British Naval Attach√© in Chile, travelling to Santiago in 1950. The Chilean Minister of National Defence was effusive in his praise for Lee-Barber. In 1954 Lee-Barber was promoted to Commodore and place in command of the Inshore Flotilla at Harwich. His command comprised minesweepers and fishery protection vessels under the command of younger officers. His final posting was as Admiral Superintendent, commanding the dockyard at Malta.

She founded the A-Zed School and the Institute for Creative Development, later renamed Williams College, in Berkeley, California. Educational career Williams graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1891. She taught high school in Oakland and was said to be the first woman instructor in mathematics at the University of California. In the process, she became critical of the way children are taught, writing: :\\"The real issue in education ... is not a question of method or curriculum, but of the massing of children. Instead of aiming for freedom and independence of thought, our formal education imposes a pattern on the growing mind‚Äîputs it into a universal mold. We mass our children into an agglomerative whole, and then wonder that they emerge bereft of personality and initiative.\\" Williams founded two secondary schools in which the focus was on small classes, cooperation rather than individual competition, and developing a love for learning rather than inculcating a specific curriculum. The first of these, the A-Zed School in Berkeley, was founded in 1907. Ormeida Curtis Harrison, wife of the naturalist Charles Keeler, was her assistant principal. Williams remained the school's principal for a decade, before moving on to found another school. In 1917 Williams bought the John Hopkins Spring Estate in the Berkeley hills to house a new institution, the Cora L. Williams Institute for Creative Development, an elementary and secondary school focused on music, poetry, literature, and languages and on creative methods of instruction. It eventually transformed into a cluster of educational institutions under the supertitle Williams College, including a four-year private liberal arts college, a preparatory school, and schools of research, poetry, arts, and metaphysics. Notable lecturers at the school included the psychologist Alfred Adler, and notable students included Helen Bacon Hooper, who danced with Martha Graham, and author Irving Wallace. Founded in 1918, the school was housed on the estate for five decades; it closed in 1966. Williams' educational experiments drew international interest, and Williams College has been called \\"the first New Age institute\\". Its site, the John Hopkins Spring Estate, was designated a City of Berkeley Landmark in 2000. Writings Williams had a strong interest in mathematics and philosophy, especially metaphysics, and she published several books centered on metaphysical rumination. Creative Involution (1916) is a response to Henri Bergson's Creative Evolution, which had appeared five years earlier. Starting from Bergson's insistence on the fact that \\"the evolution of life [is] in the double direction of individuality and association\\", Williams emphasizes the necessity for greater attention to the principle of cohesion or association which Berson termed involution, as a means of moving human society forwards. Reviewers found the book by turns stimulating and puzzling, and more aphoristic than analytical. The Fourth Dimensional Reaches of the Exposition (1915) is an idiosyncratic appreciation of the 1915 Pan-Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco that uses the fourth dimension as a metaphor for the exposition's ability to transport the viewer out of ordinary life. This book includes an early use of the word 'hyperspace' in its modern sense of a portal into another dimension. There are several full-page etchings of exposition sites by the artist Gertrude Partington Albright. As If (1914) is a piece of speculative fiction concerning two transdimensional beings named Diocles and Agnesi. As with such earlier speculative works as Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels, Williams' primary purpose is to deliver a critique of her own world by allowing us to see it through the eyes of nonhumans. As the novel opens, a telegraph operator named Clarence Barston has intercepted a series of letters between Diocles and his wife Agnesi. In this correspondence, Diocles is reporting on Earth and its curious inhabitants, commenting, for example, on the strangeness of existence in three dimensions compared to their own ten- dimensional universe. As their separation continues, it appears that Diocles and Agnesi are not receiving each other's letters, but they continue their correspondence nonetheless. The first half of the book ends with Diocles about to enter an eleventh dimension. The second half of the book consists of Agnesi's account of what happens to her after she is somehow ejected from the ten-dimensional universe. She suddenly finds herself trapped inside a new \\"outer self\\", a woman named Mary James who is writing a novel about a character named Agnesi. This section of the book is narrated in Agnesi's voice as she tries to communicate with Mary and come to terms with her new situation. Mary is a schoolteacher, and the trapped Agnesi is horrified to find her classroom occupied by \\"a great beast of indefinite outline and motley color resembling a dragon\\" instead of children. Williams uses this dragon metaphor as the basis for an extended critique of secondary school educational methods. Towards the end of the book, Mary shows her superior at the school, Professor Passihof, her novel-in-progress, and he reciprocates by showing her something he had written many years earlier‚Äî which turns out to be the very letters of Diocles with which As If opens. The book closes with Passihof and Mary recognizing each other as Diocles and Agnesi, finally reunited in the eleventh dimension. =Publications= * As If: A Philosophical Phantasy (1914) * The Fourth Dimensional Reaches of the Exposition (1915) * Creative Involution (1916; introduction by Edwin Markham) * Adding a New Dimension to Education (1928) References External links Category:1865 births Category:1937 deaths Category:American school administrators Category:Founders of schools in the United States Category:University of California, Berkeley alumni Category:University of California, Berkeley faculty Category:Schoolteachers from California Category:20th-century American women writers Category:20th-century American novelists Category:American speculative fiction writers Category:American women novelists Category:Women science fiction and fantasy writers ","title":"Cora Lenore Williams"},{"id":"55038297","text":"Galkynysh Square (Square of Revival) is a square in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan.
