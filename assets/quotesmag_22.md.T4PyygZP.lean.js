The manuscript, named after a monk called Liuthar, was probably created around the year 1000 at the order of Otto III at the Abbey of Reichenau and lends its name to the Liuthar Group of Reichenau illuminated manuscripts. The backgrounds of all the images are illuminated in gold leaf, a seminal innovation in western illumination. After the French Revolution, the manuscript fell to private property and was only returned in 1848.Herta Lepie, Georg Minkenberg, Die Schatzkammer des Aachener Domes, Brimberg, Aachen 1995, , p. 60. Today the Gospels belong to the Aachen Cathedral Treasury, and along with the Carolingian Gospels they form one of the two especially significant and valuable manuscripts kept there. In 2003 the manuscript was included by UNESCO in the Memory of the World Programme, along with other, later works of the Reichenau School.  Description and Classification = The Manuscript = Content and Layout  The manuscript comprises 256 parchment pages of 29.8 x 21.5 centimetres containing the Vulgate text of the Four Gospels of Hieronymus written with black ink in a single column of Carolingian minuscule. Titles and headings are in golden rustic capitals and the section numbers are also in gold. In addition to the gospels, the codex also contains their prologues (called Arguments), a pericope, 31 fullpage miniatures, including a depiction of the Four Evangelists, four initial pages, 21 images with scenes from the life of Jesus, Liuthar's dedication page with a depiction of the Apotheosis of Otto III, and twelve canon pages. For the first time in Medieval illumination, 21 pages of upright miniatures with scenes from the Life of Jesus were added, some with two registers one under the other. Despite the small size of these scenes, the figures appear monumental, framed by arches, with all the backgrounds in gold leaf ‚Äì another novelty. The images are seen as a combination of models from Late antique, Byzantine and Treverene art. Ernst G√ºnther Grimme said of them, \\"the reality of the eternal determines their appearance.\\" The Liuthar Gospels were probably gifted at the foundation of the royal collegiate church of Aachen, consecrated to the Holy Virgin (Aachen Cathedral) in the year 1000. A lot of evidence demonstrates that for centuries the Holy Roman Emperors swore their coronation oath on these Gospels when they were crowned at Aachen, as recorded by the canons of the church college, who also used the Gospels for their own ordination oaths.  Apotheosis of Otto III  The double-sided dedication page preceding the text of the gospels is of great significance. On the left page the monk Liuthar stands in a barbed Quatrefoil holding a book of Gospels to hand to Otto III, enthroned on the other page. Above and below in golden capitals on a purple background is a dedicatory inscription in Leonine Hexameter, reading: \\"Emperor Otto, may God clothe your heart with this book. Remember that you received it from Liuthar.\\" The image on the opposite page shows Otto on a throne supported by Tellus, the personification of the Earth on a background of goldleaf. Otto is depicted in the style of an ancient Roman Emperor, wearing a tunic and a chlamys. Exemplary of Medieval royal imagery, Otto is surrounded by an aureola, a motif which is otherwise only used in depictions of Jesus Christ. This expresses the idea in Medieval rulership ideology that through his coronation Otto himself became the anointed one, the Christ. This is confirmed by the Hand of God surrounded by a blue halo and superimposed on a cross, which crowns the Emperor, and also by his arms which are outspread in a pose of crucifixion. His right hand holds the Globus cruciger, while his left is outstretched to receive the Gospels being gifted by Liuthar. The four symbols of the Evangelists hold the white scroll of the gospel over the breast of the Emperor, thereby clothing his heart with it. The scene is framed by a purple arch. The colour, restricted to Roman Emperors, indicates Otto's imperial status. Two kings performing homage stand on either side with lances. These might be identified with Boles≈Çaw of Poland and Stephen of Hungary, who were raised to royal dignity by Otto in the year 1000. In the lower register two worldly dignitaries with helmets, lances, and shields approach from the left. Two spiritual dignitaries approach from the right. Each wears an alb, a chasuble and a pallium, showing that they are archbishops, and carries writing implements. This Apotheosis image is thus a variation on the image of Christ in Majesty, uniquely influenced by Byzantine art. Emperor Otto III is shown crowned by God, supported by the Earth, an Earthly Christ with his heart full of the Gospel holding power over the world. = The Cover = A silver cover from about 1170/80 was attached to the back cover of the Carolingian Treasury Gospels until 1870, when it was recycled as a front cover for the Liuthar Gospels. In 1972, this cover was removed and the Gospels were rebound. This cover measures 30.8 x 23.7 centimetres and consists of a wooden core, a sheet of silver, and Byzantine ivories from the middle of the tenth century. The ivories form the centre of the cover, depicting busts of four saints: John the Evangelist, John the Baptist, Theodore Tyron and Saint George. The silver sheet consists of the Four Evangelists arranged around the ivories in lunettes and an archangel standing on either side. The ivories are meant to serve as the folding wings of the ivory relief of the golden book cover of the Treasury Gospels and have no connection whatsoever with the silverwork evangelists and angels = Aachen Christmas carol = In 1886, the master of the Aachen MinsterIt was a collegiate church then, not a cathedral in the sense of the main church of a bishop's see, since the Diocese of Aachen had been abolished in 1825 and was re-established only in 1930. college, Heinrich B√∂ckelerHeinrich B√∂ckeler, Die Melodie des Aachener Weihnachtsliedes, in Zeitschrift des Aachener Geschichtsvereins 11, 1887, 176-184. found the so- called Aachen Fragment in the Liuthar Gospels, which was dated orthographically to the fourteenth or fifteenth centuries.August Brecher, Musik im Aachener Dom in zw√∂lf Jahrhunderten, Einhard, Aachen 1998, , p. 31.

It is the first prelude and fugue in the first book of The Well-Tempered Clavier, a series of 48 preludes and fugues by the composer. An early version of the prelude, BWV 846A, is found in the Klavierb√ºchlein f√ºr Wilhelm Friedemann Bach. Analysis=Prelude= The prelude is 35 bars long and consists mostly of broken chords. Below are the first four bars of the prelude: : { << ew PianoStaff << ew Staff << \\\\clef treble \\\\key c \\\\major \\\\time 4/4 ew Voice \\\\relative c { \\\\voiceOne r8 g16 c e g, c e r8 g,16 c e g, c e r8 a,16 d f a, d f r8 a,16 d f a, d f r8 g,16 d' f g, d' f r8 g,16 d' f g, d' f r8 g,16 c e g, c e r8 g,16 c e g, c e } ew Voice \\\\relative c' { \\\\voiceTwo r16 e8._~ e4 r16 e8._~ e4 r16 d8._~ d4 r16 d8._~ d4 r16 d8._~ d4 r16 d8._~ d4 r16 e8._~ e4 r16 e8._~ e4 } >> ew Staff << \\\\clef bass \\\\key c \\\\major \\\\time 4/4 ew Voice \\\\relative c' { c2 c c c b b c c } >> >> >> } The prelude continues like this with different variations on harmony and change of key. The prelude ends with a single C major chord. =Fugue= The fugue is 27 bars long and is written for four voices. It starts with a two-measure subject in the alto voice. The first voice to join is the soprano, which replies with the answer in the dominant key (G major). : { #(set-global-staff-size 17) \\\\relative{ ew Staff \\\\clef treble \\\\key c \\\\major \\\\tempo 4=70 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\override Score.BarNumber #'transparent = ##t << { \\\\voiceOne R1 r2 r8 g'^\\"Soprano\\" a b c8. d32 c b8 e a, d ~ d16 e d c b} ew Voice= \\"Alto\\" { \\\\voiceTwo r8 c,_\\"Alto\\" d e f8. g32 f e8 a8 d,8 g ~ g16 a g f e f e d c d c b a8 fis' g4~ g8 fis16 e fis8 d g} >> } } The answer is repeated in the tenor and bass voices, respectively, when they enter. The piece then modulates through various related keys, with the subject being repeated in each of the four voices. The piece eventually ends up back in the home key. It ends with each voice stopping at a note and holding it until the end, forming a C-major chord. Legacy=Schwencke Measure= Some earlier editions of the prelude contain an extra bar between bars 22 and 23 known as the \\"Schwencke measure\\", a measure allegedly added by in an attempt to correct what he or someone else erroneously deemed a \\"faulty\\" progression (though it may be accidentally corrupted manuscript(s) associated with Schwencke), even though this sort of progression was standard in the music of Bach's time. : { << ew PianoStaff << ew Staff << \\\\tempo 8=116 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\clef treble \\\\key c \\\\major \\\\time 4/4 ew Voice \\\\relative c' { r8 b16 c es b c es r8 b16 c es b c es } >> ew Staff << \\\\clef bass \\\\key c \\\\major \\\\time 4/4 ew Voice \\\\relative c { \\\\voiceOne r16 es8._~ es4 r16 es8._~ es4 } ew Voice \\\\relative c { \\\\voiceTwo g2 g } >> >> >> } However, according to Hermann Keller, \\"Schwencke was a sophisticated and well-informed musician who was probably not thinking of improving Bach.\\"Keller, Hermann (1965). Das Wohltemperierte Klavier von Johann Sebastian Bach, p.40. Kassel, etc.: B√§renreiter. . Quoted in M√ºllemann, Norbert \\"On the lookout for the lost measure: Bach‚Äôs C-major Prelude from the Well-Tempered Clavier I\\", Henle.de. Accessed: June 8 2018. Measure 22 contains an F in the bass, which skips to A in measure 23, creating a diminished third; while the Schwencke measure has a G in the bass of a (second inversion) minor chord with C as its root borrowed from the parallel harmonic minor. The A may be considered as its enharmonic, G, which creates a major second step with F, but A functions as an upper leading-tone (parallel natural or descending melodic minor). Franz Kroll may have been the first to question and edit the measure, first in 1862, and the measure does not occur in Bach's student Heinrich Gerber's 1725 manuscript copy. August Halm was also critical of the measure, (2009). August Halm: A Critical and Creative Life in Music, p.56.

The edition of the prelude used by Gounod contains the Schwencke measure. =20th Century= Mstislav Rostropovich compared this Prelude to the introductory bars of Bach's famous Prelude of Cello Suite No. 1, in a video named Rostropovich interprets Bach, filmed in 1991 at the Basilique Sainte Madeleine in V√©zelay, France. \\"Repent Walpurgis\\", the last track on the debut album by progressive rock group Procol Harum contains an arrangement of the prelude by band leader Gary Brooker.

UNICEF Canada advises the Canadian Government on policies and legislation which support programs and commitments under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. It joined 10 other National Committees to assist children over 190 countries and territories. UNICEF Canada Ambassadors UNICEF Canada has a long history of support from its Goodwill Ambassadors and high-profile supporters. They have included Ambassadors such as Sharon, Lois and Bram, Solange Tuyishime, Bayan Yammout, Karina LeBlanc, Veronica Tennant, Jan Lisiecki, Mariatu Kamara, John Nsabimana, and Elizabeth Dallaire. UNICEF Goodwill Ambassadors help the organization reach a wider audience, enabling it to highlight work undertaken to improve the lives of the most vulnerable children around the world. They help raise awareness of the needs of children, and use their talent and fame to fundraise, advocate, and educate on behalf of UNICEF. Finances UNICEF Canada meets the guidelines and high standards of the Imagine Canada Standards Program. Out of every dollar, 70 per cent goes toward helping children, 23 per cent is spent on fundraising costs, and 7 per cent on administration. In 2017 alone, UNICEF Canada helped respond to 337 humanitarian emergencies in 102 countries. UNICEF also improved sanitation for 22 million people, provided over 15.6 million children with micronutrient powder to prevent anemia and vitamin deficiencies and provided education to 8.8 million children. Convention of the Rights of the Child The 1989 United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child is a comprehensive human rights treaty which enshrines specific children's rights in international law. These rights define universal principles and standards for the status and treatment of children worldwide. UNICEF in Canada In Canada, UNICEF works to promote the rights of all children living in Canada, regardless of race, religion or nationality and is a member of the Children's Rights Alliance. It advocates children's rights around the world, child-sensitive governance, children's rights and well-being, children in fragile and conflict states and other youth engagement programs. Operations and Leadership UNICEF Canada is headquartered in Toronto, Ontario and maintains regional offices in Montreal, Calgary and Vancouver. David Morley is the CEO of the UNICEF Canada. Current members of the National Board of Directors of the Executive Leadership are Linton Carter, Rowena Pinto and Dave Spedding. Fundraising UNICEF is not funded by the UN. Instead, it relies on voluntary donations to fund its work for children worldwide. UNICEF Canada organized the first Trick or Treat Campaign in 1955, and continues to raise funds annually on Halloween (October 31), recognized for this long standing brand work now as National UNICEF Day. UNICEF Canada raises funds primarily through donations, the sale of cards and gifts, partnerships with companies, emergency relief efforts and special events. Partners UNICEF Canada is supported entirely by voluntary contributions and the support from government partners and corporate and community partners makes a significant contribution to its work. Some of the companies that currently have a corporate partnership with UNICEF Canada includes IKEA Foundation, Hallmark, H&M;, Teck, Intact, International Graphics, Sherritt, Maple Leaf, Loblaw, and Fondation L‚ÄôOccitane.

Mhadei was built to a stock design by van de Stadt called Tonga 56 measuring 56 feet in length and displacing 23 tons. It was decided to build a wood-core and fibreglass sandwich hull for better performance than steel or aluminium. The boat has two mainsails, two Genoa's, a stay-sail, one try-sail and two gennaker's. She is also fitted with satellite communications, electronic navigation systems and a Monitor windvane equipped for emergency steering. Service history From Goa Dilip Donde set out on a circumnavigation voyage on 19 August 2009, and returned on 19 May 2010; Mhadei was the first Tonga 56 to complete a solo circumnavigation. In 2012, Mhadei was used by Indian Navy Lt Cdr Abhilash Tomy to complete a single-handed, unassisted, non-stop circumnavigation under sail. He was the first Indian, second Asian, and 79th person to do so. Mhadei finished the journey at Kochi, after completing a voyage of 23,100 nautical miles (42,781 km). In 2013, the navy's first all female team of sailors began preparation for another circumnavigation of the world, led by Lieutenant Commander Shweta Kapur. The crew practised in a race from Cape Town to Rio de Janeiro. In May 2016 INSV Mhadei set sail from Goa for a voyage to Port Louis in Mauritius skippered by Lt. Cdr. Vartika Joshi, a Naval Constructor. This was the first open-ocean voyage of the Navy‚Äôs all-woman crew of the Mhadei. It was a training voyage to expose the young crew to the weather that they would confront during the circumnavigation of the globe scheduled for 2017. The crew entered Port Louis, Mauritius, on Tuesday, 14 June 2016. The crew members were skipper Lieutenant Commander Vartika Joshi, a Naval architect, and five others: Lieutenant P. Swathi, Lt.

The Kurdish Parliament first agreed to turn Halabja District into a province in 1999, but it was not enacted at the time. The Kurdistan Region approved of it becoming a governorate in June 2013. Iraq's Council of Ministers approved a bill on 31 December 2013 to enable it. The Iraqi Parliament had to pass the bill but failed to do so. However, the Speaker of the house, Osama Nujaifi, advised that Kurdistan had the power to make Halabja a province. On 13 March 2014, Nechirvan Barzani, Prime Minister of Kurdistan, signed the decision of making Halabja district the fourth governorate of Kurdistan Region; that happened just three days before the remembrance of Halabja chemical attack, which happened on 16 March 1988. On March 16, 2014, Kurdistan Region President Masoud Barzani signed a regional directive to promote Halabja from district status to a province. The Kurdish Parliament passed a bill in February 2015 to establish the legal framework for selecting a provincial council and a governor. As of December 2015, the Iraqi Parliament had not yet officially recognised the province, apparently because of issues with budgeting finance for it. In August 2018, the then Iraqi Interior Minister, Qasim al-Araji, approved authorization for the opening of federal offices that would issue passports, national ID cards, and other civil documents under its own name. Districts Halabja comprises the central district, Halabja, and three other districts, Sirwan, Khurmal, and Byara (Bayyarah).

Comparison to other primary systems  In the US, most primary elections are party- specific: voters select a political party, either as part of the voter registration process or at the ballot box, and may vote only for candidates sharing that same party affiliation. These primary systems use plurality voting, where each voter may express a preference for one candidate per office. The candidate in each party receiving the most votes advances to the general election. Voters not affiliated with a major political party may or may not be able to participate in these primary elections, depending on jurisdictional rules, and candidates not affiliated with a major political party may be nominated to the general election by other processes such as minor party conventions or petition. The non-partisan blanket primary (aka \\"jungle primary\\" or top-two primary) is a single primary election in which all voters may participate, and all candidates appear on the same ballot, regardless of party affiliation or lack of party affiliation. The top two most-voted candidates (even if members of the same party) will appear in the general election. This is intended to allow non-partisan voters and candidates to participate, and to allow more moderate nominees in the general election (since voters from both sides of the spectrum can vote for them). However, the non-partisan blanket primary still only allows voters a single choice per office, and is therefore prone to the spoiler effect, where candidates espousing similar ideologies split votes, helping candidates with opposing ideologies (but fewer candidates) to win. Like a blanket primary, the unified primary has only one primary election, in which all voters participate, and all candidates appear on a single ballot regardless of political party affiliation. Unlike a blanket primary, the unified primary uses approval voting in the first round, in which voters may express support for any number of favored candidates, which is intended to eliminate vote splitting and spoilers (since voters can support a partisan favorite and a moderate). The top two most-approved candidates will appear in the general election.  Analysis  Proponents posit that the Unified Primary system will increase voter choice by allowing all voters to participate equally in all stages of the election process, by allowing voters to express support for more than a single candidate, and by allowing all candidates to compete in a uniform election process, regardless of political party affiliation or lack of affiliation. In contrast, FairVote, a national election reform non-profit that advocates instant-runoff voting, theorized that it is likely that general election races would have two finalists from the same major party in districts where a majority of voters affiliate with that party, and thereby reduce voter choice in the election that has statistically higher turnout than current primary elections. Election method simulation of various voting systems indicate that an election system comprising approval voting in the first stage and a vote between the top two approved in the second stage is the highest- performing simple (unranked, unit weighted) two-stage voting system on the criteria of Bayesian regret and propensity to elect the Condorcet winner. These simulations confirmed early election science research that found that the most efficient simple two-stage voting system allows two or more votes in the first stage and a single vote between two candidates in the second stage. The unified primary method fails independence of clones, unlike Approval voting, because any time the second-most approved candidate wins the runoff, if a clone of the most-approved candidate is introduced, then the runoff will be only between the most-approved candidate and their clone, preventing the second-most approved candidate and any of their clones from winning.  Reform campaigns = Oregon = The use of approval voting on an open field of all candidates for partisan office as a replacement for current party-nominated primary systems was first publicly proposed in November 2011Fair and Unified Elections Initiative Page Info, Facebook by brothers Mark and Jon Frohnmayer in the form of a draft ballot initiative. The text of the failed Oregon Ballot Measure 65 (2008), which would have instituted a top-two primary system, served as the foundation for the draft, which was then modified to allow voters to select as many candidates as favored for each office. The Frohnmayer brothers are sons of former Oregon public official Dave Frohnmayer, whose plurality loss to Governor Barbara Roberts in Oregon's 1990 gubernatorial election was blamed in part on an independent candidate in the race who siphoned off conservative votes. A formal petition drive to institute the Unified Primary system in Oregon began in October 2013. Petitioners completed the sponsorship phase of the initiative process by collecting more than 1,000 verified signatures from registered voters to advance the measure toward the November, 2014 ballot. The term \\"unified primary\\" was adopted by petitioners for what they say is etymological accuracy and to distinguish it from other primary system reform initiatives, notably open primary. The pairing \\"unified primary\\" was also advanced by Oregon's Attorney General in the draft ballot title for this initiative: \\"Changes Election Nomination Processes; Replaces Current Primary System With Unified Primary For All Candidates.\\"Oregon IP38 Draft Ballot Initiative Title, Oregon Secretary of State Several variations of this measure have been filed to date: 2014 Initiative Petitions 38 and 51.Oregon Secretary of State Initiative, Referendum, and Recall Petition Log Database, Oregon Secretary of State The campaign did not collect the 87,213 signatures required to get Petition 54 onto the ballot. (The \\"Open Primary\\" proposal that used plurality voting did collect enough signatures, but was defeated.) Frohnmayer later joined the campaign for STAR voting, an alternate voting method which would replace blanket/unified primaries with a single election that uses a score ballot and automatic runoff, though still promoting the unified primary under the name \\"Equal Top Two\\". = St. Louis = The STL Approves campaign is seeking to adopt the same system (though they refer to it simply as \\"approval voting\\") in St. Louis city elections (Mayor, Comptroller, President of the Board of Aldermen, and Alderman). Originally called St. Louisans for Ranked Choice Voting, the campaign switched to advocating for Unified Primary, primarily due to learning that St. Louis and St. Louis County voting machines are incompatible with IRV. In April 2020 they gathered enough signatures to qualify for the ballot, Proposition D. Polling shows more than 70% support for the measure, with majority support among all demographic groups and parties.

They were built in Spain to a British design completing between 1914 and 1916. They served until 1930‚Äì1932. The Bustamante class saw little service, spent mostly in a training squadron and patrolling the coasts of Spain. Compared to contemporary foreign designs, the Bustamante class was considered outclassed, with poor armament and a lack of speed. Design and description In 1908, the Spanish Cortes passed a Naval Law that reorganised Spain's naval dockyards to make them more efficient and allowing a modern navy to be built. The law also authorised a large shipbuilding construction programme, with two battleships, three destroyers, 24 torpedo boats and 4 gunboats to be completed by 1914. While the ships were to be built in Spain's newly refurbished shipyards, most of the ships would be of foreign design.Gardiner and Gray 1985, pp. 375‚Äì376. The three destroyers were built by Sociedad Espa√±ola de Construcci√≥n Naval (SECN), the consortium set up to refurbish and manage the Spanish shipyards, at Cartagena to a British design (either by Vickers or John BrownPurnell's Illustrated Encyclopedia of Modern Weapons and Warfare, p. 484. ‚Äî both companies were part of the SECN consortium.).Gardiner and Gray 1985, p. 380. The new destroyers were long, with a beam of , a draft of and displaced . They were powered by steam turbines, fed by Yarrow or Normand boilers and driving three propeller shafts. The machinery was rated at which gave a speed of . The vessels had a range of at . Two funnels were fitted. Armament consisted of five Vickers guns, two side-by-side on the ships' forecastle, one aft on the ships' centreline, and the remaining two guns on the ships' beam. Two sets of twin torpedo tubes were fitted.Parkes 1931, p. 424. Construction and service The three destroyers, Bustamante, Villaamil and Cadarso were laid down between 1911 and 1913. Bustamante and Villaamil were launched in 1913 while Cadarso was launched in 1914. Bustamante was completed in 1914, with Villaamil and Cadarso completing in 1916. Owing to the cessation of material support from Great Britain during the First World War Cadarso was fitted with torpedo tubes instead of the planned 450 mm tubes. By the time they entered service, the Bustamante class were outclassed by contemporary foreign destroyers, being poorly armed and slow. The ships carried out neutrality patrols around Spain's coasts during the First World War. They spent much of their time in a training squadron, and were disposed of in the early 1930s, with Cadarso being scrapped in 1930, Bustamante in 1931 and Villaamil in 1932.

She began roller skating at age six, briefly tried figure skating, then took up inline speed skating. As an inline skater, she won multiple World Championship gold medals on the United States relay team. In 2009, she transitioned to ice speed skating. At the 2010 Olympic trials, Gunther appeared to make the United States speed skating team, but was bumped from the team after another skater was granted a re-skate. In March 2010, she fell during a race and suffered a double-compound fracture that nearly severed her foot from her leg. After intensive rehab, Gunther was able to return to skating and set two personal best times in November 2011. She made the 2011‚Äì2012 World Cup team and placed third in the 1000 meters at the 2011‚Äì2012 national championships. At the 2014 U.S. Olympic trials, she skated a personal best time of 1:16.43 in the 1000 meters to place fourth and make the Olympic team. Early life Kelly Gunther was born August 14, 1987, to mother Julie Sprague in Lorain, Ohio. She began roller skating at age six after \\"[falling] in love with it\\" at Lorain Skate World. She tried figure skating, but found she wanted to skate faster than the music allowed, prompting her to take up inline skating. When she was 11, Gunther's father walked out on the family, prompting Sprague to move Gunther to Macomb County, Michigan, and take on two jobs. During the day she worked as a caseworker and at night she ran a company that cleaned up apartments after people moved. After inline skating practice, Gunther would help her mother clean. \\"It was fun,\\" Gunther recalled. \\"As fun as cleaning can be.\\" Gunther attended Washington Elementary and Whittier Middle schools in Lorain before moving to Michigan. As a child, she had a learning disability and was placed in special classes. She graduated from Chippewa Valley High School in 2006. Skating career During her ten years as an inline skater, Gunther made the United States' Junior World Championship team several times and won multiple gold medals as part of American relay teams. In 2009, she switched from inline skating to ice speed skating and moved to Utah to join the national team. To support herself, she worked part-time at General Electric. At the 2010 Olympic trials, Gunther appeared to win the 1000 meter race and with it the final Olympic spot in the event. (Three women were selected by a panel before the trials.) However, another skater ‚Äì Rebekah Bradford ‚Äì was granted a re-skate after falling in her heat. Bradford ended up bettering Gunther's time and taking the Olympic spot. \\"It was a major setback, more emotionally than anything else,\\" Gunther recalled. \\"It was heartbreaking.\\" A few months later, in March 2010, Gunther slipped during a 500-meter race at the Utah Olympic Oval. She crashed into the pads, causing a double-compound fracture in her ankle that nearly severed her foot from her leg. \\"2010 was definitely not one of my better years on the ice,\\" she later reflected. \\"But it was the year that helped shape who I am\\". Most people who saw the injury felt Gunther would never skate again, let alone compete at a high level. After surgery to repair her ankle, Gunther moved to Colorado Springs to be near the USOC Training Center's rehabilitation facility. She spent four months in a cast. Six months after the accident, she was skating again, but was not able to seriously train. Even so, Gunther decided to race again in December 2010. By coincidence, her first race was a 500-meter race at the Utah Olympic Oval, in the same lane as her accident. \\"I actually had tears in my eyes when I approached the starting line\\", she recalled. After a year, the screws in her ankle were removed and she could start training again. Gunther returned to professional-level competition on the American Cup circuit, winning the 1000 meters. At the U.S. Single Distance Championships in November 2011, she set personal bests in the 500 meter and 1500 meter races. She made the 2011‚Äì2012 World Cup Team and took third place in the 1000 meters at the national championships. At the 2014 Olympic trials, Gunther skated a personal best of 1:16.43 in the 1000 meters on the same track as her accident. Her time placed her fourth, and earned her an Olympic berth. \\"I'm a really big believer that everything happens for a reason,\\" she said. \\"There's a reason I fell at this rink, so making this 2014 team is just icing on the cake with everything I've been through.\\" Earlier at the trials, she finished seventh in the 500 meters. She concluded the trials with a seventh-place finish in the 1500 meters. Gunther is coached by Ryan Shimabukuro. Previously, she was coached by inline coach Robb Dunn. Personal life Gunther's father died in November 2012. Although it had been years since he was in contact with the family, Gunther attended his funeral. \\"My dad was an alcoholic,\\" she commented. \\"I forgave him.\\" As of 2014, Gunther lives in West Jordan, Utah. She is taking classes at Salt Lake Community College in pursuit of a degree in early childhood education. In her free time she likes to go shopping, hang out with friends, and vacation in St. Thomas. Gunther lists her mother as the greatest influence in her life. Kelly has a brother, Brad Sprague that still resides in Lorain, Ohio.

The ODNB notes that she was \\"acclaimed in the 1940s as second only to Margot Fonteyn among British ballerinas\\". Early life Sarah Gilmour was born in Sungai Lembing, Malaya (now Malaysia) on 2 November 1921. Her father, Colin Gilmour, was the Chief Medical Officer there. Aged four or five, she was sent back to boarding school in London, and only visited her parents every two or three years. Career Gilmour enrolled at the Rambert School at the age of 12, and her talent was soon recognised by Marie Rambert. She was trained by the choreographer Antony Tudor and the ballerina Tamara Karsavina. She was in the original cast of the 1934 ballet Bar aux Folies-Berg√®re by Ballet Rambert, alongside Alicia Markova, Frederick Ashton, Pearl Argyle, Diana Gould, Elisabeth Schooling and Leslie EdwardsVaughan D. Frederick Ashton and his Ballets. A & C Black Ltd, London, 1977, p106. Her first important role created specifically by her was the title role of Andr√©e Howard's 1939 Lady Into Fox. It became the role with which she was most closely associated. Howard was unable to dance the part herself due to illness, and Marie Rambert suggested Gilmour. Helped by extensive coaching and Nadia Benois' costume designs, she successfully conveyed the transformation from Mrs Tebrick into a wild vixen. Ballet Rambert toured Australia from 1947 to 1949. Originally scheduled for six months, it extended to 18, due to the absence of bookings back home and the ending of their Arts Council funding. Marie Rambert considered moving the company there permanently. Gilmour was one of several dancers who decided to stay on in Australia. Another was (later Dame) Margaret Scott, who considered Gilmour's first act of Giselle the greatest ever.Jill Sykes, Obituary: \\"Pivotal artist of sublime skills and rich beauty\\", The Age, 29 May 2004, p. 23 Gilmour returned to London briefly in 1952.

Circa 1343,The Arakanese chronicle Rakhine Razawin Thit (Sandamala Linkara Vol. 1 1997: 181) says the family left Launggyet for Pinya in 705 ME (28 March 1343 to 27 March 1344) but the Burmese Hmannan chronicle (Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 403) says the family returned near the end of King Uzana I's reign: c. 704 ME (28 March 1342 to 27 March 1343). According to inscriptional evidence (Than Tun 1959: 124), Uzana I's reign ended on 1 September 1340. the entire family was allowed to return to Pinya where her father was reappointed to his old position at Thayet. Queen of Pinya and Ava According to the chronicles, the princess grew up to be a great beauty. On 12 December 1350, Kyawswa II, a second cousin of hers, took over the Pinya throne and married her as his chief queen.Than Tun 1959: 124Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 384 After Kyawswa II died in March 1359, his younger brother Narathu succeeded, and made his sister-in-law, now known as Saw Omma, his chief queen.Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 385 Narathu came to power just as Shan raids from the north began to intensify. The raiders sacked both Upper Burmese kingdoms of Sagaing and Pinya in April and June 1364 successively, and took away Narathu.Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 393-394 Narathu's elder brother Uzana II succeeded and raised her to chief queen. But Uzana II's reign lasted a mere three months. In September 1364, Thado Minbya, who had taken over the Sagaing throne, conquered Pinya, and made her his chief queen. Though Thado Minbya hailed from Sagaing, he and Saw Omma were related: He was her second cousin once removed. According to the chronicles, the young king, who was at least a dozen years her junior,Per Zatadawbon Yazawin (Zata 1960: 72), Thado Minbya was born on 7 December 1345 (13th waxing of Pyatho 707 ME). was madly in love with her. It was not just the king who appreciated her beauty. When Nga Tetpya, a famous bandit from Sagaing, who stole from the rich and shared the loot with the poor, was captured, brought before the king, and asked of how he chose to be executed, Tetpya reportedly said he chose Saw Omma, the prettiest queen.Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 398-399(Htin Aung 1967: 85): Not only did the young king not take offense but he also forgave the bandit, appreciative of the bandit's bravery. Tetpya was so overcome by the king's graciousness that he entered the royal service, and became the king's most distinguished commanders. In rebellion Her nearly 17-year reign as queen ended abruptly in September 1367 when Thado Minbya died from smallpox on his way back to Ava from a military expedition to Sagu, about away from Ava.Than Tun 1959: 128 One of the king's close advisers, Nga Nu, quickly sailed up the Irrawaddy with his men, and entered the queen's chambers. He told the queen that he had come to kill her on Thado Minbya's orders because the king did not want her to be taken by another man.Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 400‚Äì401Harvey 1925: 81 Saw Omma is said to have asked: \\"Nga Nu, aren't you a man?\\" The duo then decided to seize the throne. Nga Nu's men killed off the palace guards and maids, who did not agree with the plan. Ultimately they decided to leave for Sagaing, right across the Irrawaddy from Ava. There, the couple proclaimed themselves king and queen of Sagaing, hoping to revive the old Sagaing Kingdom. However, the pretenders from Pinya did not attract any allegiance from the former vassals of Sagaing. At Ava, her own brother Swa Saw Ke was elected to become king on 5 September 1367. One of his first acts as king was to dispatch a battalion to remove the couple from Sagaing. The battalion was commanded by Nga Nu's elder brother Yazathingyan Nga Mauk. Nga Nu escaped but Saw Omma was caught. Swa spared his sister's life, and married her off to Nga Mauk, who was made governor of Taungbyon and Wayindok, two small regions near modern Mount Popa.Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 405 NotesReferencesBibliography   Category:Queens consort of Pinya Category:Chief queens consort of Ava ","title":"Saw Omma of Pinya"},{"id":"41551242","text":"Cypris is a name for Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love.

History The cathedral was built between 1875 and 1883 by architect Friedrich Schmidt in Vienna and Carol Benesch. Its building style belongs to historicism and especially lends style with Romanesque architecture features, with some elements of the Gothic architecture. The building is 40 m long and 22 m wide. It is the most famous Catholic church in Bucharest. The cathedral was consecrated by Archbishop Ignatius Paoli, on February 15, 1884, and was attended by \\"all the priests of the archdiocese, all seminarians, the entire diplomatic corps accredited in Bucharest, President of the Council of Ministers, the President of the Senate, City Hall and many others. Mihail KogƒÉlniceanu, impressed the greatness of the worship catholic have to declare in the same year from the parliament, that this cathedral was \\"the most beautiful religious building that exists in Romania\\". \\"patron of the cathedral was chosen in honor of Saint Joseph and Mary (mother of Jesus). The feast day of the patron of the cathedral is March 19. Construction Saint Joseph is the metropolitan cathedral and seat of the archbishop. Its founder is Bishop Ignatius Paoli, from the Passionist Congregation of Monks, and he was the first Archbishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bucharest. The money to build the cathedral came from believers in Bucharest, from various wealthy personalities, but also from foreign benefactors, acquaintances or friends of Bishop Paoli. The work was led by Dutch Passionist monk Alfons Zegers, an architect by training. He had been called to Bucharest from Passionist monastery in Dublin (Ireland), by Bishop Paoli. Since 1880, work on own were led by skilful architect Carol Benesch. The stone used in construction was brought from the quarries of Ruse, Bulgaria, and bricks were purchased from Bucharest and neighboring villages. Construction work began in the sanctuary apse, with ample facilities for land consolidation and raising it. Lack of funds and the outbreak of the Romanian War of Independence in 1877 made the work very hard to advance in stages until 1883. In the late autumn of this year construction was completed. On Friday, February 15, 1885, the Pontifical Mass was celebrated by Archbishop Ignatius Paoli for consecration and inauguration of Saint Joseph Cathedral. Archbishop was surrounded by all his priests, the seminarians studying at the seminary in carved and representatives of civil authorities: Delegate Council of Ministers, Minister of Foreign Affairs, President of the Senate, prefect of police, the mayor of Bucharest and Bucharest entire diplomatic corps. When lifting the palace residence of the Archbishop in 1925 was built a tower in which were mounted six bells of the cathedral. The resistance of the cathedral building was put in danger since the late 1990s by Cathedral Plaza Bucharest, a building whose construction was declared illegal by Suceava Court of Appeal. The interior The main altar of the cathedral was executed in Rome in white Carrara marble, by architect Friedrich Schmidt and Carol Benesch, and then mounted in Bucharest by specialist Niccolo Orassi. Woodwork ceiling was apparently executed in Brasov. Mayer Company of Munich executed original Stained glass windows, destroyed in bombing of April 4, 1944, contained the eight large paintings of the apse windows with scenes from the life of Saint Joseph and the Holy Family, the seven medallions on the walls of the central nave mosaic \\"Mother of God\\" and two angels above the outer portal of the cathedral, as well as wood carvings of the Pulpit and the Bank for Holy Communion. Decorative painting of the Cathedral nave was executed by Georg Roder in Munich and painter Father Elsner executed decorative painting of the chapel and baptistery of the cathedral naves. Dressing the stucco colonnades, pillars and walls is the work of Italian workshop Aterio brothers. Actual stained glass was designed and executed by Natalia and Ion BrodealƒÉ couple in 1980. Large rosette above the organ, choir and the baptistery stained glass was executed in 1985 by the artist Dorin Danila. Chandeliers above the main altar and the candlestick for the Paschal candle was bought in Paris. Organ of the cathedral is one of the best organ concert in Romania. It is operated by an electro-pneumatic system that has three keyboards, flute 3375, 54 main registers and 36 auxiliary registers, with extensive possibilities of combinations required concerted practice. The organ was built and installed by the company L. Wegenstein in Timi»ôoara in 1930, replacing the organ installed in 1892 by Merklin company in Paris. Between October 2009 and April 2010 was restored by Ferdinand Stemmer its Swiss organ. Renovations Saint Joseph Cathedral suffered significant damage from the earthquakes of 1929, 1940, 1977, 1986 and 1990, and also due to the American bombing of April 4, 1944 and the German August 24 to 25, 1944. Especially from March 4, 1977 earthquake destroyed many of the facilities inside and outside the cathedral. After each earthquake, the cathedral was repaired and strengthened, but only in parts. Only in 1991 were initiated extensive building works by a plan devised by engineer Professor Alexander Ci≈ümigiu. This work was performed by a unitary thought plan for the entire edifice of the cathedral. In 1986 the works were finished painting the cathedral, begun by the painter Thomas Lasconi and completed the team led by Peter Shepherd. The cathedral is enhanced, but needs repair, both inside and outside. Following the earthquake of 1990 occurred sometimes cracks in the walls, vaults and especially deambulatoriul behind the altar. Because it rains inside, work is underway to replace the roof. Saint Joseph Cathedral was declared monument of art and architecture. And that's why Suceava Court of Appeal decided on 12 July 2011 that the building Cathedral Plaza Bucharest with 19 floors was built illegally who should have 19 floors removal by mayor of Bucharest, Sorin Oprescu. Parish Territorial parish of the Saint Joseph Cathedral, with a separate area of the Barat parish, was established in 1900.

The neighborhood consisted of buildings on either side of a lane, today named Ezrat Yisrael Street. The street is blocked on one end and opens onto Jaffa Road on the other end. Name According to the foundation deed, the name of the neighborhood was derived from two verses in the Book of Psalms: :My help comes from the Lord, the Maker of heaven and earth (Psalms 121:2) :May He send you help from the sanctuary and grant you support from Zion (Psalms 20:3) Location Ezrat Yisrael is a northeast-southwest street that runs perpendicular to Jaffa Road. It is located one block west of the intersection of Jaffa Road and King George Street, one of the vertices of the Downtown Triangle cultural and commercial district. It is a blocked street that opens only onto Jaffa Road. Above the blocked end stands the International Evangelical Church, which faces Street of the Prophets. History The Ezrat Yisrael neighborhood was founded in 1892 by Rabbi Yaakov Meir, who later became Sephardic Chief Rabbi of Mandatory Palestine, together with local activists. One reason that historians give for the founding of the neighborhood at this location was that at the time, a group of non-Jews wished to purchase the lot. Rabbi Meir called on Jerusalem activists and neighborhood-builders Nissim Elyashar, Moshe Meltzer, and Yosef Rivlin to come up with the money to buy it for Jewish settlement. The land, measuring over 5,000 cubits, was purchased at a price of 10 francs per cubit. Another reason given for the founding of the neighborhood in this location was the desire to establish a continuous Jewish presence from the Even Yisrael neighborhood south of Jaffa Road to the neighborhood of Mea Shearim further north. Historians differ on the total number of homes built in 1892 - estimates range from 20 to 26 to 30. Over time, additional stories were added to the buildings. At the beginning of the 20th century, scientific installations began to appear in Palestine. In 1904 a chemical laboratory opened in Ezrat Yisrael. In 1912 one of the first advertisements for Jewish dentists in Jerusalem was placed in HaOr, informing the public that a dentist was receiving patients in the courtyard of a pharmacist in Ezrat Yisrael. Notable residents Abraham Moses Luncz, who resided in the Even Yisrael neighborhood on the opposite side of Jaffa Road, operated a printing press in a house at the beginning of the street. In 1910 the neighborhood was home to Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, Rachel Yanait, David Ben-Gurion, and Yisrael Shohet, editors of the Poalei Zion weekly newspaper Ahdut (\\"Unity\\"). Masonic Temple Masonic Temple on Ezrat Yisrael Street In 1931 a Masonic Temple was founded at 13 Ezrat Yisrael Street, near the north end of the lane. The building was initiated by Arieh Levy and a group of Freemasons who each contributed 5,000 lira toward the construction. The Temple currently houses both the Ein Hashiloach Ar\\"i Lodge #26 and Ar\\"i Lodge #27. Members meet twice monthly and meetings are conducted in Hebrew. One block further west of Ezrat Yisrael Street, the intersection of Jaffa Road and Raoul Wallenberg Street was designated Freemason Square () by the Jerusalem municipality.Zadok, Tami. \\"Jerusalem of Stone: Finding Freemasons in Jerusalem\\".

Along with action skill, it is an essential component of any reward-directed skills.  Value of object skill  Evolutionarily speaking, more rewards per unit time would mean better chance of survival and success to both humans and animals. In order to speed up reward-oriented behaviors and thereby maximizing rewards per unit time, humans and animals mainly rely on two mechanisms. They either boost up their motivation for certain behaviors or acquire skills of these behaviors. While motivation can be initiated quickly at presence of rewards and thus has an advantage of flexibility, it tends to fade away quickly without rewards. Skill, on the other hand, appears to be much more effective in reducing the duration of target behaviors and has a stable effect even when no short-term reward is expected at all. This kind of reward-oriented skill is made up with two parts: finding an object and acting on it, the former being object skill and the latter action skill. Therefore, object skill is crucial in helping humans and animals maximizing their chance of survival and success.  Characteristics of object skill  Object skill is usually distinctly characterized by several features, including relatively stable internal value assignment, gaze and attention bias towards desired objects, automaticity of response towards desired objects, dependence on high- capacity memory and long-term nature of its effect. = Stable internal value assignment = In everyday life, people learn values of objects according to the corresponding rewarding or punishing results of choosing these objects. Their ability of finding good objects therefore depends on this kind of value- based learning, where consistency plays an important role. As a result of this comparatively consistent object-value mapping across people's lifespan, their internal value assignment to objects tends to be stable. = Gaze and attention bias = Both humans and animals use senses across different modalities to find objects; however, humans mainly rely on visual information to identify objects. Studies have shown that gaze or attention shift to desired objects always precedes any possible manual action performed on these objects. Remarkably, this gaze or attention shift occurs regardless of current intention of the initiator. This automatic gaze or attention shift is pronounced even when no reward is expected, potentially increasing the subject's chance of survival in some critical circumstances. = Automaticity of response = Studies have shown that when humans have extensively learned to find some particular objects, they start to recruit much less cognitive resource in order to finish the task. A study on monkeys with free-viewing procedure for testing gaze shift bias has also provided evidence to support the involuntary nature of object skill. According to this study, monkeys neatly fixed their gazes only at objects with higher values learned in previous training. This seems rather implausible to be accomplished through voluntary searching mechanism, given the limited space of working memory. On the other hand, faster responsivity of automatic search over voluntary search seems to be as well favored in terms of maximizing amount of reward per time unit. Thus, automaticity of response also plays a vital part in object skill. = Dependence on high-capacity memory = Just like any other skills, two aspects of object skill matter most: accuracy and speed. Accuracy is assured only if every memory-motor connection is unique, and speed is assured only if object-value information is quickly transmitted through memory-motor connections. Under such scheme, high-capacity memory seems to be a necessity in response to demand for distinct memory slots for every object-value association. = Long-term nature of effect = Object skill also tends to have a long-term effect over object perception of both humans and monkeys. Results of several studies have shown that both humans and monkeys maintain their value-based gaze bias for a long time after the initial acquisition of such bias during training. Another study on monkeys looked specifically at monkeys' response to objects very similar to ones associated with high values learned during training. The results showed that monkeys were highly responsive only to objects with high values as learned in the past, suggesting a highly object-selective object-value memory, which provides evidence for object skill's dependence of high-capacity memory. And since high-capacity memory could be created only if each memory had been retained for a long time, it is now fairly clear that object skill could only be created slowly and would remain stable once created.  Limitations of object skill  Due to its automatic and inflexible nature, object skill can be detrimental when changes happen. When values of objects change from positive to negative, quick motor response associated with object skill still occurs and might thus undermine the subject. Object skill also tends to account for the case of drug abuse, where abusers can't help but associate substances with high values as a result of their previous experience, even knowing the danger of abusing drugs. One of the possible solutions involves recruiting another system that pays attention to changes in object values. Such a system would be voluntary and slow, but the expense of maintaining this system could be compensated by avoiding potential costly dangers. The core issue then would be to figure out an optimal balance between relying on object skill and referring to local changes.

The approach was originally developed by Jens Rasmussen as part of a proactive risk management strategy, but its primary application has been as an accident analysis tool.  Overview  The approach is not domain-specific and has been used to analyse accidents in a range of industries including aviation, defence, oil and gas, public health, risk management, policing, and public health and rail transport. The method is used to analyse the contributing factors of accidents at all levels of the system, and can also be utilised to formulate safety recommendations.  Features  The AcciMap approach is useful for uncovering how factors in the various parts of the system contributed to an accident, and for arranging those factors into a logical causal diagram that illustrates how they combined to result in that event. The method also promotes a systemic view of accident causation as the AcciMap diagram extends well beyond the most immediate causes of the event to reveal the full range of higher-level factors that contributed to the outcome (or failed to prevent it from occurring). It therefore assists analysts in understanding how and why an accident took place, and prevents attention from focusing disproportionately on the immediate causes (such as errors made by front-line workers), because the factors that provoked or permitted those factors are also revealed. The approach therefore helps to avoid blaming frontline individuals for accidents and leaving the factors that contributed to their behaviour unaddressed. In extending to consider contributing factors at governmental, regulatory and societal levels, the approach also has the capacity to capture and address high-level contributing factors that are typically excluded from accident analyses developed using other methods.  Structure  The AcciMap approach involves the construction of a multi-layered causal diagram in which the various causes of an accident are arranged according to their causal remoteness from the outcome (depicted at the bottom of the diagram). The most immediate causes are shown in the lower sections of the diagram, with more remote causes shown at progressively higher levels, so that the full range of factors that contributed to the event are modelled. The precise format of the diagram varies depending on the purpose of analysis, but the lower levels typically represent the immediate precursors to the event, relating to the activities of workers and to physical events, processes and conditions that contributed to the outcome. The next highest levels typically represent company and organisational-level factors. The highest levels generally incorporate governmental or societal-level causal factors, which are external to the organisation(s) involved in the event. Compiling the multiple contributing factors and their interrelationships into a single logical diagram in this way helps analysts understand how and why the event took place and pinpoints problem areas that can be addressed to improve system safety.

The hamlet is bordered by the Moyasta River, flowing from the bogs to Poulnasherry Bay. History Moyasta was part of the Vandeleur Estate. In the post-famine era, the name Vandeleur became synonymous with the worst of landlord evictions, with over 20,000 evicted from the part of their estate in the Kilrush Union. On 13 March 1921 a Moyasta farmer and Sinn F√©in magistrate named Tom Shannon was murdered in his home by unknown assailants. According to the Irish Times on 7 April 1921, which based its article on a report from British government, the killing was done by other Sinn F√©in supporters. The government report claimed that Shannon, a magistrate in the Sinn F√©in courts, was trying to distance himself from the courts and had refused to pay local Sinn F√©in taxes. In fact, it was clear that the assailants spoke with a strange accent, something the English Court Of Inquiry was not told by the Royal Irish Constabulary. Due to the lack of information, the Court could only conclude that the murder was committed by \\"persons unknown\\". This gave the government the opportunity to use the event for some anti-Irish propaganda. According to more recent research, the murder of Tom Shannon was part of a \\"secret murder campaign\\". This campaign was directed at prominent people, often elected representatives and magistrates. As a magistrate, Shannon fell victim of this campaign.The Shooting of Tom Shannon, forgotten hero of the War of Independence in West Clare by Eoin Shanahan Railway Moyasta Junction railway station is the junction of the Kilkee and Kilrush branches of the West Clare Railway, from which point a single line continues to Ennis and Milltown Malbay.

EuroVelo 8 (EV8), named the Mediterranean Route, is a long EuroVelo long-distance cycling route running from Cadiz, Spain to Athens, Greece, and then continuing to ƒ∞zmir, Turkey and to the island of Cyprus. The route runs east-west across Europe mainly along or close to the Mediterranean coast, passing successively through 12 countries: Spain, France, Monaco, Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Montenegro, Albania, Greece, Turkey, and Cyprus. Route , the EV8 route is one of the least complete EuroVelo routes. =In Spain = , the EV8 in Spain is incomplete, so much riding will be on roads. Only one short section is complete: this is the \\"Pirinexus\\" Cycle Route which has been open in Catalonia since March 2013, and the EV8 follows this from Sant Feliu de Gu√≠xols to the border. The route starts in Cadiz and passes through Malaga, Granada, Almer√≠a, Valencia, and Barcelona before crossing the border into France. =In France= , the EV8 in the France is still in development. Therefore, much riding will have to be on roads. In France, the EV8 will eventually provide a long cycle route linking Spain to Italy following the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. It will arrive in France from the border with Spain over the Panissars pass over the Pyrenees at Le Perthus and depart at Menton on the border with Italy. In doing so, it will pass through the cities of Argel√®s-sur-Mer, Port Barcar√®s, Port Leucate, Narbonne, B√©ziers, Agde, S√®te, La Grande-Motte, Cavaillon, Apt, Forcalquier, and Nice. =In Monaco = , the EV8 in Monaco is still in development. In the tiny Principality of Monaco, the EV8 passes through the city of Monte Carlo before exiting back into France as it approaches the Italian border. =In Italy = , the EV8 in Italy is at its most advanced stage: approximately half of the route has been completed. In Italy, the EV8 goes through Turin, Piacenza (EV5), Mantua (EV7), Ferrara, Venice, and Trieste (EV9). In Italy, though the EV8 is still in development from the French border to Pavia, from there it has been completed to just past Venice. From Pavia, the EV8 follows either of two branches of the BicItalia 2 (BI2) route along the Po river valley: these are the BI 2 Ciclovia del Po e delle Lagune EV8 and the BI 2 Ciclovia Destra Po EV8. =In Slovenia = , the EV8 in Slovenia is still under development: though the route may still be cycled, it may be on busy roads. In Slovenia, the EV8 goes through Koper (EV9). =In Croatia = , the EV8 in Croatia is still under development: though the route may still be cycled, it may be on busy roads. In Croatia, the EV8 goes through Pula (EV9), Rijeka, Zadar, Split, Klek and Dubrovnik. =In Bosnia and Herzegovina= , the EV8 in Bosnia and Herzegovina is in development. Only 14 km of the EV8 passes through Bosnia and Herzegovina so you will actually be cycling along the whole of the country's coastline! The route enters from Klek in Croatia and heads towards the only town on the coast, Neum. Several kilometers south- east of Neum, the EV8 re-enters Croatia. =In Montenegro= , the EV8 in Montenegro is in development. In Montenegro, the EV8 goes through Kotor, Podgorica. It will pass by the Bay of Kotor, a UNESCO world heritage site, on the way around the Adriatic coast to Podgorica, the country's capital. =In Albania= , the EV8 in Albania is still yet to be developed.

In late 2014, Got7 signed with Sony Music Entertainment Japan and ventured into the Japanese market to release their debut Japanese-language single \\"Around the World\\". They returned to South Korea a month later to release their first full-length studio album Identify, which topped the nation's charts. In 2015, Got7 released the EPs Just Right and Mad, which yielded their most commercially successful single, \\"Just Right\\". In 2016, they moved into the Japanese market with a full-length Japanese studio album, Moriagatteyo, which entered the Oricon Albums Chart at number three. Their fifth Korean EP Flight Log: Departure and their second full-length studio album Flight Log: Turbulence were both chart-toppers, and the 2017 EP Flight Log: Arrival was the third and final part of the group's Flight Log series; at the time it was their highest selling album with more than 300,000 copies sold.

A tentative name of the group was \\"Get7\\" (), but was changed because it didn't sound good. According to Park Jin-young, \\"Got7\\" originated from best- selling first-generation group g.o.d, as Park was supposed to debut with them as a six-member mix-gender group and used the working name \\"Got6\\". The final name includes the lucky number seven, meaning \\"seven lucky people come together\\".

It has been described as the world's largest soil museum and the first soil museum in India established to international standards. History The state government established the soil museum to provide an exhibition of the richness of Kerala's soils and mineral resources, as well as to foster public awareness about conservation and ecological protection. The museum's staff were trained by personnel from the World Soil Museum at Wageningen University in the Netherlands. Exhibits The most important exhibits in the museum are a set of 82 soil monoliths 1.5 metres tall which preserve and display the intact soil profiles of all of the 82 soil series recognised in the state of Kerala. Each monolith was dug from the ground without disturbing its elements and was processed for one month or longer before being mounted for museum display. Alongside each monolith is information about the soil, including the physical characteristics of the soil series, where it is found, its nutrient status, the crops it is best suited for, and recommendations for use and management of land where the soil is present. The soil classifications displayed in the museum are based on the US Department of Agriculture soil taxonomy. Other exhibits include a geologic map of Kerala; a map of Kerala showing the distribution of the eight soil orders represented in the state; collections of rocks and minerals and the physical constituents of soil, such as clay, silt, sand, stone, and gravel; displays explaining how soils are formed; and displays about the relationship of soil to the issues of food security and climate change.

It was inspired by past sanitary fairs that happened throughout the United States to raise funds for the United States Sanitary Commission. The main exhibit building was 200,000 square feet in size. It was designed by Samuel Honeyman Kneass and William Stickland. There was also Union Street, which was 540 feet long and ran in the middle of the fair. Union Street was compared to a cathedral by Charles J. Stille. Inside the main building were \\"departments\\" with different themes. Themes included the neighboring states of New Jersey and Delaware, themes about corn and sewing, a restaurant and parlor, as well as weaponry, fine art, curiosities, transportation and children's subjects. On June 16, Abraham Lincoln and his family visited the fair. He donated 48 copies of the Emancipation Proclamation at $10 a book. They were all autographed by Lincoln. The festival raised over $1 million.

The papier-m√¢ch√© toy, covered in pigskin and playing a tune known as \\"The Maxixe\\" when its tail was twisted, was used by Edith Russell to calm frightened children in the lifeboat in which she escaped. Her story became widely known in the press at the time and was later included in the best-selling account of the disaster A Night to Remember by Walter Lord. Russell was also portrayed in the award-winning British docudrama produced by William MacQuitty that was based on Lord's book. Biography=Early life= Edith Louise Rosenbaum was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, into a wealthy Jewish family in 1879.Cincinnati Enquirer, June 16, 1890 and June 13, 1895 Her father was Harry Rosenbaum, who rose to prominence in the dry goods field as a director of Louis Stix & Co. in Cincinnati. He was later influential as a cloak and suit manufacturer in his own right and an investor in garment industry real estate in New York, where he moved with his wife, the former Sophia Hollstein, and daughter Edith in 1902.New York Times, August 20, 1927 Edith was educated in Cincinnati public schools and a succession of finishing schools, including the Mt. Auburn Young Ladies Institute (later called the H. Thane Miller School) in Cincinnati and Miss Annabel's in Philadelphia. At age 16 in 1895 she attended the Misses Shipley's at Bryn Mawr and later Bryn Mawr College.Cincinnati Enquirer, June 9, 1895 and September 19, 1895; Kentucky Post, December 9, 1896 =Career= Edith's career in fashion began in 1908, when she moved to Paris to become a saleswoman for the haute couture house of Ch√©ruit in the Place Vend√¥me. Shortly thereafter, she joined the Paris office of La derni√®re heure √† Paris, an in-house fashion journal for the Philadelphia department store Wanamaker's. She also provided fashion sketches for the Butterick Pattern Service and to a number of American clothing stores and textile suppliers. In 1910 Rosenbaum was hired as a Paris correspondent for the newly established New York garment trade publication Women's Wear Daily. In this role, she reported regularly on the seasonal collections of the leading couture salons Paquin, Lucile, Poiret, Doucet and her former employer Ch√©ruit. At around this time, she became friends with the upcoming young couturier Jenny (Jeanne Sacerdote) and was one of her first customers, wearing her designs in a series of publicity photos for the house. In addition to covering the couture openings, Edith wrote a front page column that appeared almost daily in which she shared analyses of current trends, insider tips on new fabrics and styles, and impressions of the events and personalities of the French fashion world.Women's Wear Daily, May 25‚Äì26, July 25, August 22, September 6‚Äì8 and September 13, 1911 and February 8, March 5, March 7, April 10 and April 13, 1912. Rosenbaum was involved in a serious automobile accident in 1911 in which her wealthy fiance, Ludwig Loewe, whose family owned a noted German arms manufacturing firm, was killed. She was traveling with friends to the races at Deauville when the car, driven by Loewe, crashed near Rouen. Edith suffered a concussion which caused some memory loss but no other significant injuries.Le Figaro, August 22, 1911; Women's Wear Daily, August 23, 1911; New York Times, August 22, 1911. By 1912, along with writing and reporting for Women's Wear Daily, Rosenbaum worked as a buyer and purchasing agent in Paris for a number of American firms.New York Herald, April 16, 1912. She also advised several well-known entertainment personalities on their wardrobes such as Broadway actress Ina Claire and opera singer Geraldine Farrar, becoming one of the first known celebrity stylists.The National Examiner, August 27, 1973 At the same time she branched into designing, producing a clothing line called \\"Elrose\\" for the New York department store Lord & Taylor. Among her Elrose clients were actresses Martha Hedman and Eleanor Painter. Edith Rosenbaum in 1911, the year she began work as a fashion stylist. Between 1914 and 1919 Edith Rosenbaum was American press attach√© for the governing body of the French fashion industry, the Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne, now called Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture and a division of the F√©d√©ration fran√ßaise de la couture.Women's Wear Daily, May 15, 1915; Crawford, M.D.C., The Ways of Fashion (1948), pp. 121-122. She was a highly critical observer of the fashion industry, both in New York and Paris, and her opinions were frequently quoted in the press.American Cloak & Suit Review, March 1914, p. 167. In 1915 she served as an advisor on the American Fashion Exhibit at the Panama-Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco.Women's Wear Daily, June 30, 1915. Edith continued as a correspondent for Women's Wear Daily until about 1917, although she contributed occasional articles thereafter.Women's Wear Daily, March 27, 1916 In 1916 Edith designed a collection of sportswear for Sidney Blumenthal & Co., including golf skirts and jackets.American Cloak & Suit Review, March 1916, p. 184a. One of her coats for Blumenthal she officially copyrighted.Library of Congress Catalogue of Copyright Entries, No. 4, V. 11-12 (1916-1917), p. 7325. For about three months during the First World War, Rosenbaum took a break from reporting on fashion by accepting a journalistic post with the American Red Cross, dispatching news from the frontlines to the organization and the press. In this capacity, Edith was one of the first female war correspondents, sharing that distinction with the New York Evening Journal's Nellie Bly. Other letters she wrote, detailing her experiences in the trenches, where she was embedded with French and British troops in 1917, were published sporadically, and independent accounts of her work appeared in the New York World, the New York Herald and several syndicated newspapers.New York Herald, July 22, 1917; Kansas City Star, September 12, 1917. Edith's wartime correspondence was poignant and extensive but was unfortunately never published in full, although a number of original letters exist today in private collections. Edith was in the trenches four times, according to the New York Herald, and in April 1917, while serving in a Red Cross hospital set up in a convent, was caught in the bombardment of the Chemin des Dames during the famous Second Battle of the Aisne.New York Herald, July 22, 1917. By 1916, through connections in the garment trade, Edith launched a secondary vocation as dog fancier, specializing in the Pekingese breed.New York Herald, April 2, 1916; New York Times, January 17, 1922. A member of the Pekingese Club of America, Edith displayed her \\"Pekes\\" nationally until the mid 1920s and frequently traveled with them overseas.American Kennel Gazette & Stud Book, September 30, 1922, p. 843; Freeport Daily Review, December 20, 1924. She also bred dogs for a number of famous clients, including Maurice Chevalier. Her operation was called Wee Wong Kennels and was located in Freeport, Long Island, known for its champion brood, including Edith's own award-winning \\"Tiny Toy.\\" Nassau Daily Review, July 1, 1926. The kennels' popularity with theatrical celebrities inspired a spate of newsreel coverage in 1919.South Side Observer & Nassau Post, March 14, 1919. By 1920, due to rampant anti-German sentiment in Paris during and just after the war, Edith Anglicized her surname to \\"Russell.\\" The French fashion industry in particular was rife with discrimination; couture houses were banning journalists, and in some cases former clients, who had German names.Women's Wear Daily, December 22, 1915. A 1922 advertisement for Edith Russell's fashion consulting and importing business. In 1923 she was recognized by the Associated Dress Industries of America for her achievements and honored two years later by the International Ladies' Garment Workers Union for her work during the war. In the 1920s, Rosenbaum wrote for the magazines Cassell's in London and Moda in Rome. From 1934, she slowly withdrew from the fashion industry. =Titanic and later life= On April 5, 1912, Edith Rosenbaum, in her capacity as Paris correspondent for Women's Wear Daily, filed a report on the fashions worn at the Auteuil races.Women's Wear Daily, April 16, 1912. Eager to get back to New York with her purchases for the season, she booked passage on the George Washington to sail two days later, Easter Sunday.Ladies Home Companion, May 1964, p. 90. But a wire from her editor, asking her to cover the Paris-Roubaix races on Sunday, caused her to delay her crossing until April 10 when she boarded the RMS Titanic, en route from Southampton to New York. In addition to her own First Class stateroom, A-11, she is believed to have reserved another for the accommodation of her 19 pieces of baggage; this extra room was possibly E-63. Before boarding at Cherbourg, Edith asked about insuring her luggage but was reportedly told it was unnecessary since the ship was \\"unsinkable.\\" After the Titanic's collision with an iceberg on the night of April 14, Edith claimed to have locked all her trunks, containing the valuable couture merchandise she was importing, before going out on the deck. While sitting in the lounge, watching the general evacuation, she spied her room steward, Robert Wareham, and called to him. She told him she had heard the Titanic was going to be towed to Halifax while passengers were transferred to another ship, and she was worried about her luggage. But when she handed Wareham her trunk keys so he could check her bags through Customs for her, he told her to \\"kiss your trunks good-bye.\\" The steward did return to Edith's cabin to fetch her \\"mascot,\\" a small papier- mache music box in the shape of a pig, complete with black and white spotted fur. It played \\"The Maxixe,\\" a popular song when its tail was wound.BBC History Magazine (Titanic supplement), April 2012, p. 8. Discovering that in France the pig was regarded as a good luck symbol, her mother had given the toy to Edith after the car wreck she survived the year before. Edith had promised her mother she would keep it with her always. When Wareham came back with the little trifle, wrapped in a blanket, Edith headed for the boat deck, ending up on the starboard side of the ship. There she was noticed by J. Bruce Ismay, chairman of the White Star Line, the steamship company that owned the Titanic. He admonished her for not having gotten into a lifeboat yet and directed her down a stairwell to the deck below where one was being loaded.New York Times, April 23, 1912. There she was helped into Lifeboat No. 11 by a male passenger, after a crewman had seized her toy pig, perhaps thinking it was a live pet and tossed it in ahead of her. Boat 11 was lowered with an estimated 68 to 70 people aboard, including many children. Boat 11, overloaded by about five passengers, is believed to have carried the largest number of occupants of any launched that night. As Boat 11 rowed away from the sinking ship, Edith found herself surrounded by crying and fidgety youngsters, and to calm and amuse them she played her little musical pig, twisting its tail to emit the strains of \\"The Maxixe.\\" One of the children was 10-month-old Frank Aks with whom she was reunited many years later, and she showed him the pig that had once entertained him.Life Magazine, May 18, 1953, p. 91. Rosenbaum later sued the White Star Line, for the loss of her luggage. It was one of the largest claims filed against the shipping company in the aftermath of the disaster.New York Herald, February 12, 1913. Although retired from her work as a fashion buyer in Paris from about 1937, Edith Russell continued traveling extensively. She remained active socially, befriending many celebrities during her stays in the south of France, Majorca, Lucerne and Rome, including the Duke of Windsor, Benito Mussolini and Anna Magnani. In addition, Edith maintained a close friendship with the couturier Jenny and actor Peter Lawford and his wife Patricia Kennedy, who made her a godmother to their children.Brewster, Hugh, Gilded Lives, Fatal Voyage (2012), p. 287; Lawford, Lady, Bitch: The Autobiography of Lady Lawford (1986), pp. 103-107. Edith lived at London's Claridge's Hotel in the 1940s, moving eventually to a suite at the Embassy House Hotel in Queens Gate, London. She seems to have been expatriated by the early 1950s. At this time she became increasingly in demand as a pundit on the Titanic tragedy which had reentered public consciousness due to recently released films and books about the event. She attended a special media preview of the movie Titanic in 1953, afterward giving interviews to Life magazine and the New York daily press.Life Magazine, May 18, 1953, p. 96. She posed for photos carrying her famous toy pig and standing beside the dress she had worn on a fateful night. In 1955 historian Walter Lord published his best-seller A Night to Remember which featured Edith's story.Lord, Walter, A Night to Remember (1955), pp. 44, 123, 187. She later served as an advisor on the 1958 British film adaptation of Lord‚Äôs book, produced by William MacQuitty. She and her lucky pig were also portrayed in the film.MacQuitty, William, A Life to Remember (1994), p. 326. In her later years, Edith Russell and her toy pig were in demand for TV and radio talk shows. Although now elderly, Edith became a regular guest on television and radio programs. Most of these aired on BBC-1 and BBC-2 channels but she was also interviewed on television in France and Germany.Observer, May 10, 1970; 1963 French TV interview with Edith Russell For her first TV interview in 1956 she brought along her trusty pig and retold the famous story of their escape from the Titanic. The pig's musical apparatus had broken by this time, however, and she was not able to play the tune.Daily Mail, November 28, 1956; 1956 BBC-TV interview with Edith Russell In 1963, when the Titanic Historical Society was formed in the United States, Edith was made an honorary member. During these years, Edith also wrote a number of articles about her Titanic experiences for the popular press, among which were pieces appearing in Pageant (1953), Woman's Own (1962), and the Ladies Home Companion (1964). Edith Rosenbaum Russell died at the Mary Abbott Hospital in London on April 4, 1975, at the age of 95.New York Times, April 5, 1975; The Guardian, April 5, 1975. Most of Edith's belongings were dispersed piecemeal among relatives and friends, including Walter Lord who inherited her legendary pig. On Lord's death in 2002, the toy was bequeathed to the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, London, which also received the floral-printed boudoir slippers Edith had worn when she boarded Lifeboat 11. =Legacy= In his 2001 expedition to the wreck of the Titanic, filmmaker James Cameron and his team discovered Edith's cabin with its dressing table mirror still upright and intact. Photos of the room and an account of its exploration were published in the 2003 book Ghosts of the Abyss by Don Lynch and Ken Marschall. Edith was also portrayed in the accompanying documentary, released by Walt Disney Pictures.Lynch, Don and Marschall, Ken, Ghosts of the Abyss (2003), pp. 32, 106-107. Pig on the Titanic by Gary Crew, an illustrated children's book about Edith and her lucky mascot, was published in 2005 by HarperCollins (). During the 2012 centennial commemoration of the sinking of the Titanic, Edith's story resurfaced in newspaper and magazine articles as well as in museum exhibitions, notably at the National Maritime Museum, where her pig and slippers were displayed. The museum has since restored the mechanism within the music box which has allowed its tune to be heard for the first time in over 60 years. The song the toy played was confirmed to be that of \\"The Maxixe,\\" otherwise known as \\"La Sorella march,\\" a Brazilian tango ditty, originally written by Charles Borel-Clerc and Louis Gallini. Edith's story was extensively revisited that year in two well-received books about the Titanic: Hugh Brewster's Gilded Lives, Fatal Voyage and Andrew Wilson's Shadow of the Titanic. She was also featured in a further 2012 title, The Osborne Titanic Sticker Book, geared to children. In 2014 an illustrated biographical account of Edith was included in the digital book that accompanied Titanic by Sean Callery, part of Scholastic's \\"Discover More\\" children's series.

Freud lived at nearby 20 Maresfield Gardens, for the last months of his life. His house is now the Freud Museum. The sculptor Oscar Nemon was born and educated in Osijek before moving to work in Vienna in the 1920s. He had read Freud in his teens, initially approached Freud as a young sculptor and was rejected by him. After Nemon had gained his reputation in Brussels, he was approached by Freud's assistant Paul Federn in 1931 to sculpt Freud for his 75th birthday. Nemon finished busts of Freud in wood, bronze and plaster, and Freud chose to keep the wooden portrait for himself. The wooden bust is on display at the Freud Museum in Hampstead. Nemon visited Freud for a final time in London in 1938. His last sittings with Freud would create a \\"...harsher more abstracted portrait\\" which would become the head for the seated bronze in Hampstead. Freud wrote in his diary in July 1931 of Nemon's portrait that \\"The head, which the gaunt, goatee-bearded artist has fashioned from the dirt like the good Lord is very good and an astonishingly life-like impression of me.\\" On seeing the head of Freud, his housekeeper Paula Fichtl said that Nemon had made Freud look \\"too angry\\", to which Freud responded that \\"...But I am angry. I am angry with humanity.\\" The bronze, slightly larger than life size, was commissioned in the 1960s, with funds raised by a committee chaired by Donald Winnicott. The sculpture depicts Freud with his head turned to one side as if in thought, with his hands in his waistcoat pockets. Freud's daughter, Anna Freud, attended the unveiling of the statue in October 1970, accompanied by children from her Hampstead Clinic (now the Anna Freud Centre). The statue was originally located in \\"an alcove behind Swiss Cottage Library, where it was virtually hidden away from the public.\\" The Freud Museum arranged for the statue to be moved to its present location in 1998.

Background John Augustus Raffetto Sr. was born in Newtown, California, to Domenico Raffetto and Anna Pensa, both of Ognio, a mountain village northeast of Genoa, Italy. His father arrived in California \\"by way of the Isthmus of Panama in 1859, and the mother joined him later... They were among the most substantial of the early California pioneers.\\" His parents were subsistence farmers in Newtown, whose only income was sale of firewood to the Arcade Bakery in downtown Placerville. Career In his youth, Raffetto walked more than 60 miles one way to farm during summers in Genoa, Nevada; he would earn $60 a summer. He became a miner and earned $1.50 per day. =Ivy House Hotel= On February 4, 1895, Raffetto and a friend named Potts saved up enough money to buy the Conklin Academy in Placerville, which they turned into the Ivy House Hotel. In 1890, he bought out his partner and became sole proprietor. The Ivy House had fifty rooms and dining hall. The Ivy House was board for miners, serving them breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Eventually, son John Augustus Raffetto Jr. ran the Ivy House as well as a new Ivy Motel next door. Later, the Ivy House became the Placerville Academy, one of the first boarding schools in the state. During the 1950s, the City of Placerville tore down the hotel to make parking lots. In 1908 (or 1911), Raffetto bought the Cary House. In 1915, he demolished and rebuilt it with three stories that had fifty-four rooms (fifteen with baths), coffee shop, and dining room. His oldest son renamed it the Raffles Hotel. (It is now again the Cary House.) > Historical figures known to have stayed at the hotel include Mark Twain (who > used to write for the Mountain Democrat in Placerville), President Ulysses > S. Grant and John Studebaker. Hollywood figures, such as actress Bette > Davis, have graced the hotel. Most recently, Brooke Shields and Lou Diamond > Phillips filmed a movie at the hotel. Raffetto became a director of the First National Bank of Placerville. In 1917, in the name of the Cary House, Raffetto became one of three founding members of the El Dorado County Chamber of Commerce, based in Placerville. Personal On April 22, 1896, Raffetto married Adela Isadeen Creighton (March 30, 1875 ‚Äì February 9, 1927 ) of Smithflat, California. They had six children, four of whom survived early childhood, all born in the Ivy House Hotel with only a midwife: * Lloyd Raffetto (1897‚Äì1988): Co-founder of Mother Lode Bank * Elwyn Creighton Raffetto (\\"Michael Raffetto\\") (1899‚Äì1990): National radio star in 1930s and 1940s * John Augustus Raffetto Jr. (1908‚Äì1977): Co-founder of Placer National Bank ** Son Peter Raffetto: former president of River City Bank, Truckee River Bank, Sierra West Bank, Calnet Business Bank * Isadeen Adela Raffetto Murray (1910‚Äì1998): Married Alexander Howison Murray Jr., two-time mayor of Placerville Raffetto was registered as a member of the Democratic Party (United States) and a member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows and Native Sons of the Golden West.

Meek began speed skating at age two, following in the footsteps of his father and grandfather. After high school, he moved to Utah to further his speed skating career. He made the national team in 2006 and participated in the 2006 and 2010 Olympic Trials without success. Meek placed second in the 10,000 meters at the 2012‚Äì2013 National Championships. In 2013, he won two national titles taking the 25,000 and 50,000 meter events. In December, he placed third in the 5,000 meters at the Olympic Trials and thus qualified for his first Olympics. At the Olympics, Meek placed 20th in the 5,000 meters and 10th in the 10,000 meters after being added to the start list when other skaters withdrew. Early life and education Patrick Meek was born November 10, 1985 in the Chicago suburb of Evanston, Illinois into a family of avid speed skaters. His father was a speed skating coach and national team member, and his grandfather skated competitively at the club level. Meek's younger sister Kathleen also skated for a while, but gave up the sport as a kid. By age two, basically as soon as he could walk, Meek was on speed skates learning the sport. He grew up in the Chicago suburbs before moving to St. Louis, Missouri. Meek graduated from high school in St. Louis in 2004 and moved to Utah to further his speed skating career. He earned a Bachelor of Science in Political Science from the University of Utah in 2009. As of 2014, he is working on a post-graduate degree at Ashworth College. Speed skating career Meek made the national speed skating team in 2006. He elected to pursue distance events, realizing he did not have the proper physical characteristics for sprints and was well suited psychologically for long races. At the 2006 Olympic Trials, Meek had no aspirations of making the team but turned in a personal best in the 10,000 meters. 2010 was a different story ‚Äì Meek expected to make the team and was devastated when his personal best time came up short. \\"At that moment, I [couldn't] get past the fact that I didn‚Äôt make the Olympic team\\", he later commented. \\"It was tough watching the event you‚Äôd committed your life to [on TV].\\" At the 2012‚Äì2013 National Championships, Meek turned in a personal best time of 13:26.06 in the 10,000 meters en route to a second-place finish. In 2013, he won the United States title in the 25,000 and 50,000 meter races. At the Olympic Trials in December, in the 5,000 meter race Meek had both contact lenses come out with 1.5 laps to go. As a result, he \\"[couldn't] really see anything\\" but got through the race with the help of his coach yelling encouragements. He finished the race in 6:27.90, good enough for third place and a spot on the Olympic team. \\"It was kind of frightening\\", Meek recalled, but \\"when you hear [your coach yell 'This is for the Olympic team!'], you think, ‚ÄòHey, I can do one more lap'\\". A few days later, Meek turned in a personal best time of 13:23.16 in the 10,000 meters, but came up 0.39 seconds short of the only qualifying spot in the event, placing third. A the Olympics, Meek placed 20th in the 5000 meters with a time of 6:32.94. When several skaters from other nations withdrew from the 10,000 meters, Meek was selected from the alternate list to participate in the event. He finished the race in 13:28.72, placing 11th, five hundredths of a second behind Lehman. \\"Honestly I just started laughing,\\" Meek said of the difference. \\"We were so close at trials and so close today.\\" Due to his difficult workouts, Meek has earned the nickname \\"Mule.\\" He explains: \\"I don't always look pretty out there ... I am not the favorite barn animal. [But], more often than not, I get the job done out there.\\" Meek does a lot of extreme distance training (100+ laps at a time) which he says helps him in the 5,000 meter (12.5 laps) and 10,000 meter (25 laps) races. Personal life Meek won the 25000 meter and 50000 meter national championships in 2012 As part of a sponsorship deal, Meek works as a valet at the Waldorf Astoria Park City when not skating. In 2013, he teamed up with Charity: water to promote clean drinking water in the developing world. Meek also promotes Right To Play, a charity formed by former speed skater Johann Olav Koss. He has two sisters who live with his parents in Naples, Florida.

He served from 1850 to 1853 as an associate justice of the Minnesota (Territory) Supreme Court.  Biography  Cooper was born on July 22, 1821, in Frederick County, Maryland. In 1831, he moved to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, where he attended Pennsylvania College. He later studied law in the office of his brother. He was admitted to practice law in 1845 and practiced in Louistown, Pennsylvania. In 1848, he canvassed a portion of Pennsylvania for the Whig Party. As a result of this service to the Whig Party, Cooper was appointed by President Zachary Taylor as an Associate Justice of the Minnesota Territorial Supreme Court on March 15, 1849. He was confirmed by the Senate on March 19, 1849. He held the office from July 14, 1850, to April 7, 1853. Cooper later practiced law in St. Paul, Minnesota, until 1864, when he moved to Nevada Territory, where he made mining titles the specialty of his law practice. He later moved to Utah and died a patient in a Salt Lake City inebriate asylum at an age of about 55.  Criticism by Legal Profession and Newspapers  Along with Chief Justice Aaron Goodrich, Cooper was frequently criticized by members of the legal profession as unfit and incompetent. However, no charge of corruption or malfeasance was ever made against either of them. After an unfavorable editorial regarding Justice Cooper appeared in the St. Paul Pioneer newspaper in 1851, Justice Cooper's brother, Joseph Cooper, assaulted the newspaper editor, James M. Goodhue, with a knife and inflicted two wounds. Goodhue responded by firing a pistol at Cooper, who received a shot in his groin. Joseph Cooper died approximately two months later, and it was said that the pistol wound had hastened his death. References Sources  * Douglas A.

History Axelborg in 1926, drawing by Peter Tom-Petersen The interior of the building photographed by Peter Elfelt in 1927 Axelborg in 1932 Axelborg was constructed as a new headquarters for Den Danske Andelsbank, and construction was completed by 1920. The building was designed by architects Arthur Wittmaack and Vilhelm Hvals√∏e. It takes its name from the adjoining square Axeltorv, which had been inaugurated in 1917. Den Danske Andelskasse did not use the entire building. Dansk Andels G√∏dningsforretning, a cooperative manufacturer of fertilizer founded in Aarhus in 1901, was from July 1920 also headquartered in the building. In 1928, the Danish Broadcasting Corporation (founded in 1925), relocated to rented rooms in the building, but the need for more suitable facilities with proper broadcasting studios and a concert hall for the new radio symphony orchestra soon became evident. Consequently, a new building, St√¶rekassen was constructed on Kongens Nytorv and the radio relocated there in 1931. Since then, the building has been occupied by The Danish Agricultural Council (Landbrugsraadet), in 2009 renamed Landbrug & F√∏devarer (Danish Agriculture and Food Council). The building was expanded between 1961 and 1965. Architecture The main entrance The keystone The rotunda The five- storey building is constructed in brick. The building has rustication on the ground floor and arched openings along the two sides. The four upper floors stand dressed masonry and has wide pilasters between the windows. The roof features a three-bay Belvedere, topped by a balustrade, with views of Tivoli Gardens on the other side of the street. The main entrance is flanked by two wall-mounted lanterns and the keystone above the main entrance features a relief of a nude woman. The building has a central rotunda which is topped by a large, domed lantern. The 1950s extension on the rear side of the building stands in grey concrete. Today Danish Agriculture and Food Council is headquartered in the building. DLG has announced that they will be relocating to new headquarters in Fredericia.

It has most of the functions of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) APL standard ISO/IEC 13751:2001, and also list for non-homogeneous or non- rectangular data, complex numbers, symbols, temporal data, and control structures. A scripting file facility is available to organize programs in a fashion similar to using \`#include\` in C, which also provides convenient data input/output. ELI has dictionaries, tables, and a basic set of SQL-like statements. For performance, it has a compiler restricted to flat array programs. By replacing each APL character with one or two ASCII characters, ELI retains APL's succinct and expressive way of array programming compared with MATLAB or Python, ELI encourages a dataflow programming style, where the output of one operation feeds the input of another. ELI is available without charge on Windows, Linux, and macOS. Version 0.3 ELI version 0.3, described as a stable release, was released on August 10, 2015. It integrates with a cross-platform IDE, ELI Studio, which provides a code editor with specialized functions to write and load ELI code. Three added widgets are used to monitor functions, variables, libraries and command history. Version 0.3 adds several new features. * Like: string match * Match * []PP: printing precision control * )time: performance measure * []: standard input * Date and time attributes * File handle: []open, []close, []write, and []get * Semicolon (;) Example code A line of ELI executes from right to left as a chain of operations; anything to the right of ‚Äò//‚Äô is a comment.

It operates under the Presbyterian Church U.S.A. denomination under the Synod of the Trinity and the Pittsburgh Presbytery. The adjacent cemetery holds the remains of 14 Revolutionary War soldiers from the area. The municipality of Bethel Park was named after the church. The Bethel Presbyterian Church was founded by Rev. John McMillan, the first Presbyterian missionary west of the Allegheny Mountains. The church was founded by Rev. John McMillan, the first Presbyterian missionary west of the Allegheny Mountains, during his third missionary trip. The origins of the Bethel Presbyterian Church date to November 5, 1776, when McMillan preached and baptized 5 children at Peter's Creek. Early services were held at a log house owned by Oliver Miller. The Peter's Creek congregation grew and later split into an Eastern Division and the Western Division. In 1785 or 1786, the Eastern Division was renamed Lebanon and the Western Division was renamed Bethel. In 1808, Oliver Miller's son James added a stone section to the right of his father's log house and in 1830 he and his son Oliver replaced the log house with a new stone section , now known as the Oliver Miller Homestead. A number of members of Bethel Presbyterian Church played roles in the Whiskey Rebellion. On July 15, 1794, shots were fired as federal officers served a warrant on William Miller, a Bethel church member and the last man that day in Allegheny County to receive a warrant for failure to register his still, the first violent event of the Whiskey Rebellion. After that incident, a crowd gathered. Reverend Clark, McMillan's successor, tried to dissuade the band: Clark's pleas was ultimately unsuccessful, and the group advanced upon General John Neville's house, burning it to the ground, a confrontation known as Battle of Bower Hill. The modern incarnation of the church was officially incorporated on March 11, 1907. The current building was completed May 1910. In 1951, the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission erected a historical marker, noting its connection to Rev. John McMillan and its historic importance.

Prior to his election as mayor, Condon was the deputy chief of staff for U.S. Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers. A Spokane native, Condon graduated from Gonzaga Preparatory School in 1992 and then enrolled at Boston College, where he received a B.A. degree in Finance and Military Science. He immediately entered the U.S. Army where he rose to the rank of captain. He retired from military service in 2005, briefly working in small business before being hired by McMorris Rodgers. He rose to become her deputy chief of staff. In May 2011, Condon announced he would challenge incumbent Spokane mayor Mary Verner in that year's mayoral election. Though he claimed to have a positive working relationship with Verner, he disagreed with her policies regarding taxation, vehicle registration and criminal justice. Condon went on to defeat Verner in a close race. As mayor, Condon focused on reforming the Spokane Police Department, improving the city's financial situation and building up the city's infrastructure and parks. He was reelected in 2015, becoming the first Spokane mayor to be elected to a second term since 1973. However, he was term- limited and thus ineligible to run for reelection in 2019. Nadine Woodward won the election to succeed him and took office at the end of that year.  Mayoral tenure Crime and use-of force incidents were reported to have declined during Condon's tenure as mayor of Spokane. Use of force by the Spokane Police Department was down by 22% while violent crime was down by 19.72% and overall crime down by 8.36% as of early 2015. Despite campaigning against utility rate and property tax increases, Condon proposed 2.9% utility rate increases to be used for capital projects to reduce the amount of raw sewage flowing into the Spokane River due to major storm events. He also proposed a 2% property tax increase to purchase police and fire equipment. He also pledged to tie all future utility rate increases to inflation. The Condon Administration's Integrated Clean Water Plan was one of the first integrated plans to be developed under the Environmental Protection Agency's integrated plan framework. Costs for the plan were estimated up to $310 million. In late 2014, the city issued $200 million in \\"green\\" bonds to pay for part of the Integrated Clean Water Plan. It was the largest amount of debt assumed in the city's history. In December 2013 Hoyt Larison, a businessman who had contributed to Condon's reelection campaign and political action committee, was nominated by Condon to serve on the Spokane International Airport Board. Mayor Condon withdrew Larison's name from consideration after members of the City Council and The Spokesman-Review began inquiring into the timing of Larison's donations to his campaign. In 2014, Condon announced that the City of Spokane would join the nationwide Ban the box movement by removing questions relating to criminal history on city applications. In August that year, Condon announced San Luis Potosi, San Luis Potosi, Mexico, as Spokane's newest sister city. The following month, officials from the Washington State Auditor's office released a report showing the City of Spokane had multiple rules violations in the handling of Federal grants. This was the third year in a row that the City of Spokane showed an increase in audit findings. Mayor Condon's proposed 2015 budget included a $7,000 raise for himself, bringing his salary to nearly $180,000. Condon later announced that he would be donating his salary increase to local charities. In 2015 the City of Spokane's Salary Review Commission voted unanimously to decrease the Mayor's salary to $163,000 effective from the following year. = Spokane Home Builders Association = In 2014, Condon vetoed an ordinance sponsored by Jon Snyder that would have prohibited the City from supplying water and sewer services to areas challenged under the Washington State Growth Management Act. The Spokane Home Builders Association, a major contributor to Condon's campaign, lobbied hard for the veto. = Spokane Fire Department = In 2013, when conservatives held the Council majority, Condon created a new organizational structure for the Spokane Fire Department which increased the number of political appointees to 14. The Spokane Firefighters Labor Union Local 29 filed a lawsuit against the city. In the November 2013 elections, the Spokane City Council majority shifted and passed a repeal of the previous ordinance expanding the political appointments. Superior Court Judge Kathleen O'Connor sided with Spokane Firefighter Labor Union Local 29, calling the city's justification for the expansion \\"ludicrous\\". Condon announced in May 2014 that he had chosen to appeal this Superior Court ruling. The case was eventually dismissed.

Near ‚Äîbut not on‚Äî the Freedom Trail, it is a minor tourist attraction. The stone, a flattened sphere about in diameter, hollowed out on one side, is embedded in the foundation of a building on Marshall Street (a narrow alley named for Thomas Marshall, captain of a ferry to Charlestown in the late 17th century) in the Blackstone Block Historic District. Below the stone is a plinth inscribed \\"Boston Stone 1737\\". There is no plaque and no further elucidation, and the Boston Stone has no official status. History 19th century line drawing of the Boston Stone The stone was originally a millstone used for grinding paint pigments. It was imported from England in 1635 cited in or 1700 by the painter Tom Childs. in 1836, the stone was recovered while the foundations for the present building were being dug, and was placed in the brick wall in the building that still stands today. According to popular legend and some sources, the stone is the geographic center of Boston, as it was used in colonial times by surveyors as the zero point for outlying milestones showing the distance to Boston, analogous to the London Stone, but this is almost certainly not true ‚Äì there are no contemporary records indicating this, the 1767 Milestones stretching from Boston to Springfield, Massachusetts are not based on the Boston Stone, and the Old State House would have been a more likely center point for measuring distances to the city. 19th-century advertising for the Marshall House inn describes the original inscribing of the Boston Stone's plinth, and perhaps its attribution as Boston's zero milestone, as an early 19th-century advertising ploy. Nonetheless, the 1921 Rand, McNally guide to the city opined that it was probably set up to provide directions to nearby shops in imitation of the London Stone.

Etymology Rashmi (Sanskrit: ‡§∞‡§∂‡•ç‡§Æ‡§ø) meaning \\"The very first ray of light\\", beam, string, rope, ray of hope, splendour, rein, leash, whip, goad and food, but this term is generally associated with the solar rays even though all burning objects are luminescent and emit light-rays.) Overview All planets in the Solar System and the Moon bask in the glory of the brightly burning Sun; they are seen to shine because they are constantly reflecting in all directions the solar rays they receive which are actually energy-beams. These rashmis or light-rays, the electromagnetic radiation, which have a direct impact on the lives of all living beings on earth. One of many names of Sun in Sanskrit is \\"Rashmi Rathi\\".  Calculation of Rashmi bala or strength The effect of the solar rays reflected by these heavenly bodies on to the earth gets modified according to the kind and nature of the particular rasi or astrological sign covered by them during the course of their transits, i.e. orbital motion round the Sun. Thus, when it is in deep exaltation, the Sun emits rashmis or light- rays of maximum strength‚Äìvalue of 10, the Moon, of 9, Mars of 5, Mercury of 5, Jupiter of 7, Venus of 8 and Saturn of 5 units, and when in deep debilitation their rashmi-strength is 0 unit. According to the method described by Parasara in his Brihat Parasara Hora Shastra, the rashmi‚Äìstrength for each of their intervening positions is to be calculated on pro‚Äìrata basis, which value would decrease or increase as they move towards or away from their point of deep debilitation. If the planet is in its sign of exaltation the rashmi‚Äìvalue initially arrived at is to be trebled; in its Moolatrikona sign, it is to be doubled, and in own sign to be multiplied by two and divided by two; in its intimate friend‚Äôs sign to be multiplied by four and divided by three and in a friendly sign it is to be multiplied by six and divided by five, if in an inimical sign the rashmi‚Äìvalue originally arrived at is to be halved, in the sign of a bitter‚Äìfoe the original rashmi‚Äìvalue should be multiplied by two and divided by five but no correction is to be made when the planet is in a neutral sign. The corrected rashmi‚Äìvalue of each of the seven astrological planets barring the Lunar-nodes is then to be totalled. Janardan Harji in the section of Mansagari devoted to the effects of Rashmi-bala states that in case the planet is in its exaltation sign, the rashmi-value gained by a planet is to be trebled, if it is in its own sign or dwadasamsa or intimate friends sign the said value is to be doubled, if it is debilitated then the value is to be reduced by 1/16th and if it is debilitated but in retrograde motion the rashmi-value gained is to be doubled. Effect Parasara tells us that the person, even if born in a well-to-do family, will remain poor and unhappy if collectively the rashmi‚Äìvalue is five or less than five, if the sum total of rashmis contributed by all planets at the time of birth is between six and ten, the person will be poor and a manual labourer without wife and children. A person blessed with eleven rashmis will have meagre wealth and few children; with twelve rashmis possess meagre wealth but will be wicked and an idiot; with thirteen rashmis the person will be a thief; with fourteen rashmis the person will be wealthy, learned and have a family; with fifteen rashmis the person will possess good qualities, be head of family and proficient; with sixteen rashmis most distinguished in the family; with seventeen rashmis an employer of many; with eighteen rashmis one has and maintains a large family; with nineteen rashmis earns a good reputation and becomes well-known; with twenty rashmis, blessed with a large family and many relatives; with twenty- one rashmis, maintains and protects fifty people; with twenty-two rashmis, very charitable and kind; with twenty-three rashmis well-cultured and happy, and if the total rashmis are between twenty-four and thirty the person will be healthy, powerful, well-connected and rich. The person blessed with rashmis aggregating between thirty-one and forty will be a high official or a minister supporting one hundred to a thousand persons, between forty-one and fifty rashmis the person will be a ruler or a king, and with more than fifty rashmis the person will be the all-powerful ruler of men. With regard to the afore- stated results Parasara qualifies that these will hold true according to the conditions and family status of the person at birth, and according to the particular signs distance-wise from the deep debilitation point etc.; occupied by the planets ‚Äì that the effects of planets moving from their debilitation to exaltation will be full, otherwise it will be less and less. He declares that correct predictions cannot be made without taking into account the collective rashmi-bala of all planets and their effects. Janardan Harji states that if the sum total of the rashmis thus gained is between one and five, the person will be unhappy, devoid of family, troubled, wicked, poor and bad in speech and conduct; if that sum total is between six and ten rashmis, the person will be not have any relatives and helpful friends, will reside abroad or far away from place of birth, be unfortunate and slovenly; if between eleven and fifteen rashmis, the person will be a chief, respected, happy, head of family and a dharmatma; between sixteen and twenty rashmis, the person will be a much praised dignitary and occupy a high official post; if between twenty-one and twenty-five rashmis, the person will possess a radiant and powerful personality, be courageous, learned, brave, successful and renowned; if between twenty-five and thirty rashmis, the person will gain support from the high and powerful quarters, hold an important and trustworthy position or become a close adviser or a minister; between thirty-one and thirty- seven rashmis, progressively graded, the person will be wealthy holding a very important commanding position or a ruler; and if the total rashmis gained exceed thirty-seven, the person will become a king or ruler more powerful and influential the more rashmis are gained. The low or high status in one‚Äôs life depends on the lesser or the greater number of rashmis gained at the time of birth; similarly on the basis of the lesser or greater number of rashmis gained at the time of death can be known the Adhamagati or the Madhyamagati or the Uttamagati attained by the deceased. If at the time of query malefic planets endowed with more rashmi-bala are in the 6th, the 8th and the 12th or aspect these bhavas the ailing person will not survive but if benefic planets are similarly placed the patient will survive.

He has won various awards for this work including the Galardon Angel Carranza of Mexico‚Äôs National Ceramics Prize in 1989. Bernabe Campechano has worked for over forty years in the ceramics town of Tonal√°, Jalisco. He has created a number of traditional Jalisco ceramics, but is best known for his petatillo pieces. Petatillo ceramics are noted for their intricate designs, which place tiny crosshatches in the empty spaces among the larger design elements. This work is intricate and time-consuming, which has made it expensive and hard to find. His family began making this pottery in the mid 19th century, and the artisan has continued the tradition, teaching his children as well as others. Bernabe Campechano continues to work in his workshop in Tonal√°, along with his children. Their work is a combination of tradition and innovation. He uses white, black, beige and red clays as well as enamel paints for ceramics, some of which he prepares himself. Traditional colors include black, red and white, but the workshop has also experimented with other colors such as green and blue with success. His children have also experimented with high-fire ceramics. His pieces are shaped both with molds and turntables. Slips and paints are made from mineral pigments and are applied using animal hair brushes, made at the workshop. Petatillo pieces are first colored red inside and out after drying. The major decorative images are first traced on the piece then filled in. The empty spaces that are left are filled in with tiny crosshatched lines, which gives the ceramic its name. The piece is fired for the first time, then glazed and fired again. Today the traditional glazes have been replaced with lead-free versions. Most of the petatillo pieces are bowls, vases, platters, soup tureens and water glasses.

The soil is sandy and there are fields to the west. Name Je≈æica was attested in written sources in 1356 as Gezziczsch (and as Yessicz in 1425 and Jesicz in 1464). The name is a diminutive derived from the Slovene common noun je≈æa (\\"small grassy slope between two flat areas in a valley\\"), referring to the local geography (cf. Je≈æa). In the past the German name was Jeschza.

The officials tried to placate the peasants, but they were unsuccessful, leading to the 1515 Slovene Peasant Revolt. Foundation of the old wooden bridge (1724‚Äì1846), where motorhomes are parked today In 1713, plans were made for the new road from Vienna to Trieste. The work was finished in 1730, and the new bridge was built in Je≈æica: the first since the destruction of the Roman bridge. Je≈æica was an important site because it controlled access to the bridge across the Sava; a large building known as Grad (literally, 'castle') was a former toll house for the bridge. The building was owned by the Tavƒçar family before the Second World War. =Modern era= A new bridge was built over the Sava in 1846, and was the basis for today's bridge. A school was built in Je≈æica in 1869, and regular schooling started in 1871. The Kamnik Railway was laid through Je≈æica in 1891, and a new train station named Tauzherhof was established at Je≈æica in 1893. The 1895 Ljubljana earthquake also caused damage in Je≈æica, especially to the church, which was repaired afterwards. The first fire department was established in 1902 at the initiative of Mayor Anton Vilfan. In 1910, Je≈æica's first post office was established, the train station was renamed Jeschza, and water mains were installed. During the First World War, soldiers were quartered in people's homes, inns, and shops. Italian forces managed to approach Je≈æica in May, 1916 and Bregar's Meadow () near the Russian Czar Inn was shelled. =Second World War= Je≈æica bus station at the former Italian- German border. The Italian border station is on the left. On April 11, 1941 Je≈æica was occupied up to the Sava River by the Italian Army, although the locals had expected occupation by the German Army. German forces occupied the territory east of the bridge, and the border between Italy and Germany was established at the ƒårnuƒçe Bridge. A few months later, the border was shifted a few meters south. The border crossed an area with fields called Prod, below the villages of Savlje and Kleƒçe. The Germans built a road through the area known as Nem≈°ka cesta (German Street), today's Obvozna cesta (Bypass Street). A new railway was also built, connecting Kamnik and the Upper Carniola Gorenjska Railway, which extended east to the village of Laze pri Dolskem. The border was secured with wire fencing, minefields, and watchtowers. The main border crossing was in Je≈æica, where the bus station is today. Two border checkpoints still stand today. On September 7, 1941 the first resistance against the Italian forces was carried out, when a night patrol of Italian border finance police was attacked in Mala Vas. Two policemen were badly injured. The date was declared a memorial day in Je≈æica in 1955. After the 1943 Armistice of Cassibile, the Italian army left Je≈æica along with the rest of Ljubljana, and the German army moved in. This led to establishment of Domobranstvo. The Slovene Partisans entered Je≈æica together with the rest of Ljubljana in May 1945. =SFR Yugoslavia= Rebuilding of Je≈æica began soon after the war. An agricultural cooperative was established in 1947. Bus service was established, and then a trolleybus in 1958, which was discontinued in 1968. A Partisan grave and cenotaph was created at the Sto≈æice Cemetery in 1950, and a plaque honoring the People's Hero Danila Kumar was installed in 1955. In 1961, Je≈æica annexed the former village of Mala Vas na Posavju.Spremembe naselij 1948‚Äì95. 1996. Database. Ljubljana: Geografski in≈°titut ZRC SAZU, DZS. In the 1970s, the BS 7 apartment blocks were built nearby, connecting urban area with the rest of Ljubljana. Je≈æica was annexed by the City of Ljubljana in 1974, ending its existence as an independent settlement. =Independent Slovenia= Je≈æica looks very different today than it did in the past, especially its surroundings. The small village became part of Ljubljana. Construction of new houses has redefined its landscape while the village's tourist industry has collapsed. However, a new park was built in 2014, extending from Je≈æica to Jar≈°e and the route has become popular for horse riders and cyclists. Other recent projects include the installation of a roundabout in 2012, the renovation of the ƒårnuƒçe bridge and the construction of Florjanƒçkov Hram Hotel in 2014. Future The City Municipality of Ljubljana has plans to extend Vienna Street (Dunajska cesta) from Russian Czar to Obvozna cesta, crossing Je≈æica. Obvozna cesta is also planned for renovation, and the road will cross Je≈æica through the bus station. A large number of houses are planned for demolition. On a grass field north of Russian Czar, there are plans for apartment blocks and business space as the new center of the community of Posavje.Odlok o obƒçinskem podrobnem prostorskem naƒçrtu za dele obmoƒçij urejanja BS 4/1 Ruski car, BS 4/2 Sto≈£ice, BS 4/3 Je≈£ica in BS 4/4 Mala vas (Uradni list RS, ≈°t. 53/09-2619 in 78/10-4264) Opposition to the Dunajska extension exists among residents.Na Dunajsko cesto proti njeni ≈°iritvi. Delo. Population changes In 1787, there were 32 houses and 172 residents. In 1935 there were 131 residential buildings, 319 flats, 278 families, 510 working men and 574 women, and in 2013 Je≈æica had 500‚Äì600 residents. Streets Je≈æica Street is a residential street in the upper part of the village, and Stara Je≈æica (old Je≈æica) is in the lower part. Na Produ (\\"on the river gravel\\") is a residential street on the Sava. Ulica Bratov ƒåebulj (ƒåebulj Brothers Street) is named after Alojz (1913-1942), Vinko (1914-1941) and Franc ƒåebulj (1916-1942), who fought for the Liberation Front of the Slovene Nation. Alojz died during World War II at Krvavec, Vinko was killed in Savlje and Franc was killed on the Osovnik hill above ≈†kofja loka (where a memorial plaque stands). Za gasilskim domom (behind the fire station) is a residential street. Ulica bratov Kunovar (Kunovar Brothers Street) is named after Franc (1909-1942) and Slavko (1919-1943) Kunovar, born in Je≈æica, who also fought with the Liberation Front of the Slovene Nation. Franc died in Udinbor≈°t (near Kranj) and Slavko died in Kali≈°e, Kamnik. Kali≈°nikov trg (Kali≈°nik Place) is named after Jo≈æe Kali≈°nik, born in 1923 in Buƒç, an activist and became a partisan in 1942. He was killed the following year near Podutik. Ulica Danile Kumar (Danila Kumar Street) was named after Danila Kumar (1921-1944), who was born in Hum at Kojsko. A soldier in the Tom≈°iƒç Brigade in 1942, Kumar became an activist of the Liberation Front of the Slovene Nation and died at ≈†kofja loka (near Lubnik). A school in Sto≈æice is named after them. Udvanƒçeva ulica (Udvanc Street) is named after Matija Udvanc (1912-1942), who was born in Je≈æica. A locksmith, Udvanc was a member of the Yugoslavian Communist Party, a Yugoslav volunteer in the Spanish Civil War and a partisan. He died commanding the Sel≈°ka Troop with Stane ≈Ωagar at the battle with the Germans in Planica, near ≈Ωabnica. Kratka pot (Short Track) is a residential street near Spa Laguna. Tesovnikova ulica (Tesovnik Street) is named after Viktor Tesovnik (1928-1949), born in Nova ≈†tifta, who was an activist with the Liberation Front of the Slovene Nation and became a soldier in 1944. An officer in the Yugoslav People's Army, he died from injuries in 1949. Tourism Je≈æica began to develop at the end of the 19th century, when people from Ljubljana visited the town's inns. At that time the linden-lined Tyr≈°er Road (present-day Dunajska Road) led there. The Sava was popular for bathing, and a spa was built. World War II put an end to tourism, but it began to revive in 1965 with the opening of an auto camp. Tourists, now mostly from abroad, stayed in Je≈æica because of its proximity to Ljubljana. In 1984 more than 25,000 tourists visited Be≈æigrad District (in which Je≈æica is located), 18th place in Slovenia. A new hotel is part of the Florjanƒçkov hram complex. =Inns= 350px Je≈æica's inns were popular weekend destinations for Ljubljana residents. At the beginning of the 20th century, notable inns were Tavƒçar (pri Tavƒçarju), Florjanƒçek (pri Florjanƒçku), ≈†tern (pri ≈†ternu), Ale≈° (pri Ale≈°u) and Angelca (pri Angelci). The Tavƒçar, ≈†tern and Florjanƒçek still operate as inns, but the former Ale≈° and Angelca buildings remain. Tavƒçarjev dvor, built in 1906, is the successor of an inn with the same name which operated next door. It is named after the German Count Tavƒçar, whose inn was known as Tavƒçar hoff or Tauzherhof. The inn was popular with Ljubljana residents, who visited on weekends to swim in the Sava. During World War II the Germans used it for bridge defense, and after the war police and residents stayed there. The inn was nationalized before the Be≈æigrad catering company managed it; for several decades it has been privately owned, and is now primarily a bar. Restaurant ≈†tern, built in 1928, was named after its first owner (who was from Upper Carniola). During World War II, the Italian army was billeted there. After the war it was nationalized and became the restaurant and spa of the Be≈æigrad District. The restaurant, still in operation, serves Slovenian and other dishes.http://www.gostilna-stern.si/o_nas/zgodovina.html Florjanƒçkov hram, also known as pri Florjanƒçku (at Florjanƒçek), has existed since 1792. Historian and literary critic Fran Levec was born here in 1846, and Slovenian poet France Pre≈°eren was a frequent visitor. The restaurant specializes in Slovenian food.http://www.florjanckovhram.si/en/our-story/ Horses is a popular pub which was established in 1997. =Spa and resort= A spa was built during the 1930s, when a wine merchant named Stern built the first building and inn (which still stand). Next to them he built a dressing room and showers, and a stable also existed. Pools with sand followed. The war halted the spa's operation; after the war it was nationalized, and its manager made it a recreation center for Je≈æica. In 1965 an auto camp opened near the spa with cottages, bungalows, summer and winter swimming pools and a bowling alley. After 1991 it was denationalized and decayed, but four popular swimming pools remained until 2005. That year, the swimming pool was renovated, new hydro massage pools were built and the spa was renamed Laguna Ljubljana. Holidays A Slovene quintain, known as ≈°tehvanje, was introduced to Je≈æica and neighboring villages in 1935. Originating in the Gail Valley, the event is held each June. A gasilska veselica (firefighters' party) has been held in May since 2012. A memorial day is observed on 7 September each year, near the street of the same name, for local activists resisting fascism in Je≈æica during World War II. Sava 350px The Sava has influenced the area, and during Roman times a bridge was built at Je≈æica. The region was flood-prone. On the 1825 Franciscan cadastre, two bridges higher than the main bridge over the Sava are seen bridging the two Sava branches; one is made of steel. Work was done on the river from 1895 to 1908 from Tacen to ≈†entjakob, and erosion increased until 1935. Groundwater made the water level fall at the Kleƒçe water station.Radinja, Darko. 1951.

During the 19th century, the Je≈æica riverside was a popular recreation area. Although water quality is currently too poor for swimming, it has improved since the second half of the 20th century and the municipality of Ljubljana plans to make the river safe for swimming again.Poroƒçilo o delu in≈°tituta za vode Republike Slovenija. 2012.

Church St. Cantianus's Church The church in Je≈æica is dedicated to Saint Cantius and Companions and was built on the site of a medieval predecessor mentioned in written records in 1526. The new church was built from 1792 to 1802, and an east addition was built in 1938 based on plans by the architect Vinko Glanz (1902‚Äì1977). The painting of the Holy Cross is an 1802 work by Andreas Herrlein (1739‚Äì1837), the Stations of the Cross are the work of Leopold Layer (1752‚Äì1828), the pulpit painting by Mirko ≈†ubic (1900‚Äì1976), and the mosaic by Stane Kregar (1905‚Äì1973). The main altar was designed by the architect Ciril Zazula (1924‚Äì1995) and the side altars by Janko Omahen (1898‚Äì1980). Je≈æica was originally part of the proto- parish of Saint Peter in Ljubljana. It became a quasi-parish in 1787 and was elevated to a parish in 1850. There is an old wayside shrine below the church.

He has called himself \\"the Mick Jagger of the reptile business\\". The case was later featured on National Geographic's Locked Up Abroad. He is also the focus of the 2008 book by Bryan Christy, The Lizard King, along with Michael Van Nostrand of Strictly Reptiles, and the 2011 book Stolen World by Jennie Smith. Early life Before becoming interested in reptiles, Tom was a carpet salesman. Work with reptiles An albino Burmese python. Crutchfield is well known for his work with reptiles. In 1981, he purchased the first documented amelanistic Burmese python from a Thai dealer, for US$21,000, after seeing the animal featured in a 1981 edition of National Geographic magazine. He then partnered with Bob Clark to produce the first captive-bred albino Burmese pythons from that animal. He also produced the first albino Iguana iguana and supplied reptiles to movies such as Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and Raiders of the Lost Ark. Reptile smuggling In 1992 Tom was charged with illegally importing reptiles. The charge had little effect on business as that same year he imported sixteen Gaboon vipers and fourteen Burmese pythons via the Montgomery Zoo. Later, in 1995, Tom was convicted a second time, of illegally smuggling Fiji Banded Iguanas into the United States. The case was tried in district court after complaints that the prosecutor's dissection of Penny Crutchfield's, Tom's wife, sexual behavior was irrelevant in a case about illegally importing iguanas. In 1997, US Marshals and the US Fish and Wildlife Service, under Operation Chameleon, informed Tom that he was under investigation for wildlife smuggling for the third time. In the 1997 charge, he was accused of conspiring with two German nationals, Wolfgang Kloe and Frank Lehmeyer, and a Japanese national, Kei Tomono, to illegally import over 200 reptiles and amphibians, including Madagascar tree boas, Madagascar ground boas, as well as a species of turtles, all species under the protection of CITES., Tom immediately fled to Belize, but he was extradited back to the US by officials there. Crutchfield was sentenced to 30 months in prison. Of his 1992-1999 smuggling activity, Tom stated that he was \\"guilty because I'm guilty.\\" 2011 shooting In March 2011, Tom's business partner and the owner of the snake farm property, Bruce Stephenson, arrived on the property with a gun and barricaded himself inside one of the buildings on the property. SWAT team members responded to the situation and initiated a standoff. Tom was grazed by a bullet, and the situation ended when gunfire ceased and an armed body was found inside the building.

She was built on the Steven's Ranch, a cattle operation east of Del Mar, California by Don McQuiston and his son Donnie. After an enclosed structure was built, construction of the hull was begun. Next came the laying of the deck, installation of skylights, hatches, and interior bulkheads. The last major task was the cabin trunk located aft. From aft forward is the master stateroom, engine room, salon, mid stateroom, and fore stateroom, all finished in varnished mahogany. Power is a Ford marine diesel with a feathering 3-bladed prop. The building took several years as at the same time Don operated the family design and publishing business McQuiston & Daughter, Inc. www.mcquistonbooks.com producing coffee table books for various publishers on the outdoors, Native American Art, and America's National Parks. Upon completion she was hauled to The Knight & Carver Boatyard on San Diego's Mission Bay and launched on October 25, 1989. Her nine spars were shaped from old growth Douglas fir shipped from a mill in Washington State. She was originally rigged as a brigantine carrying three yards on the foremast. She has a bowsprit, jib boom and dolphin striker which carry three sails, the mainmast is gaff rigged with mainsail and gaff topsail, between the masts is the main staysail and fisherman. Her rigging, standing and running, about one mile of it was done by the McQuistons and son-in-law Dave Wellens using old fashioned deadeyes and wooden blocks. Seventeen months later she went for her first sail in 20 knot winds off San Diego. In 1994 with a crew of six she sailed north for her new home port of Bellingham, WA where she cruised the San Juan Islands, participated in Tall Ships events, raced with schooners up the British Columbia coast and one trip to Alaska. In 2005 she was sold to Steve and Janny Denton of the non-profit Maritime Leadership and renamed Amazing Grace. The Dentons decided to classify the ship as a passenger carrying vessel licensed by the US Coast Guard. After many modifications to meet the requirements of the USCG, the vessel received a Certificate of Inspection (COI). This COI allowed the ship to take passengers out for sailing adventures. For a few years after the ship was sold the vessel's home port was in Gig Harbor, Washington. There, her course yard was removed and was rigged as a square topsail schooner. When the teak deck needed replacement due to leakage, the owners decided to temporarily move the ship to San Diego because of its ideal weather conditions. After a few transits back and forth between San Diego and Gig Harbor, the ship was permanently relocated to San Diego where she resided until 2015, when she was sold to East Island Excursions, Inc. of Puerto Rico.Facebook Message From Janny Denton Amazing Grace Bow  Rig  Amazing Grace sets a square topsail on the foremast and seven fore and aft sails: gaff main, gaff topsail, main and fore staysails, fisherman staysail, and flying and inner jibs. These can be used in different combinations to suit the wind conditions. The rigging is complex and logical having evolved over the last two hundred years. She sets a square topsail on the foremast and seven fore and aft sails: gaff main, gaff topsail, main and fore staysails, fisherman staysail, and flying and inner jibs. These can be used in different combinations to suit the wind conditions. The ship sets a large 13 star American flag off the peak of the gaff and a 13 star pennant off the top of the main mast. The flags are representative of the rigs time period and history. After arriving in Puerto Rico, the new owners of the vessel removed the American flag off the peak of the gaff and replaced it with a Puerto Rico flag.  Non-Profit  Prior to her being sold to East Island Excursions, Inc., Amazing Grace was the primary platform for the non-profit Maritime Leadership. The ship served as a source of refreshment, leadership development, sail training and inspiration. Maritime Leadership had taken Wounded Warriors, military veterans, foster children, youth groups, juvenile detention volunteers and the Make A Wish Foundation on sailing excursions.  Racing  Amazing Grace participated in many races including the America's Schooner Cup and the Tall Ships Challenge. Although the vessel is a \\"tall ship\\", she is unusually fast. Other tall ship sailors envy her for her speed and maneuverability. Amazing Grace races against much more modern schooners and still manages to be a competitor. In the America's Schooner Cup, in the class B category, she placed 3rd in 2010, 2nd in 2012, and 1st in 2014. References External links  * East Island Excursions, Inc.

He lived and worked in Venice, California from 1965‚Äì1998, and is a key figure of the Light and Space movement. Before moving to Los Angeles in 1965, Orr was a civil rights worker in Mississippi. His artworks are found in the collections of many major cultural institutions, and his work is installed in public and private spaces internationally. Critical analysis In both his installations, sculpture and paintings, Eric Orr worked with elemental qualities of natural materials, e.g. stone, metal, water, and fire, gold leaf, lead, blood, human skull, and AM/FM radio parts. Orr worked with the \\"phenomenological exploration of perception.\\" His body of work also includes monochromatic paintings, and large scale fountains (with water & fire). His work was influenced by a religio-philosophical conceptualization of space icons found in ancient religions and cultures, such as Egyptian symbolism and Buddhist Spiritualism.Eric Orr: A Twenty-year Survey, Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego, Exhibition: April 14-May 12, 1984. Orr is associated with Light and Space, a group of mostly West Coast artists whose work is primarily concerned with perceptual experience stemming from the viewer's interaction with their work. \\"The space itself changes you, instead of an object.\\"Interview with Eric Orr & Alberta Chu, for documentary Electrum, 1997 This group also includes, among others, artists James Turrell, Dewain Valentine, Peter Alexander, Robert Irwin, and Ron Cooper. \\"(Orr) always pursued a phenomenological exploration of perception, pushing retinal responses to the limit through ingenious installations or through paintings that blur space via complex relationships of color and gesture...mystical shaman, the alchemical philosopher, whose preoccupations with ritual and the properties of space-time and negative space have led to a body of work that is superficially benign and elegant, sucking the viewer in with Zen-like calm and innocence, yet simultaneously dark and fetishistic.\\" 1960s In 1964, Orr exhibited his first work, Colt 45, a chair set in front of an automatic pistol mounted on a stand at eye level for the seated viewer. \\"Colt.45...working against the triviality of the exhibited object, it opposed the momentous face of bodily death and was a declaration of war against the viewers' expectation.... It announced Orr's feeling that the overwhelming plethora of art objects amassed, cataloged, and disseminated in our culture had come to imprison the living artist.\\"McEviley, Thomas, 'Negative Presences in Secret Spaces: The Art of Eric Orr', Artforum, Summer, 1982 His studies began at the University of Cincinnati and continued to the New School of Social Research, University of California at Berkeley, University of Mexico, New School For Social Research, Ecole de Paraphysiques-Paris. After \\"terminating\\" his formal education in 1965, Orr moved to Venice, CA and worked as Mark di Suvero's assistant. \\"In 1968, he participated in experiments in hypnosis and passed out 10,000 bags of fresh air in downtown Los Angeles. He made dry ice sculptures with Judy Chicago and Lloyd Hamrol (artist), and also created a seminal work called Wall Shadow, and Zero Mass in 1969.\\" 1970s and 1980s In the 1970s, Orr continued his installation and performance works. Giuseppe Panza acquired his immersive installation work Zero Mass. Orr continued working with philosophy, science, and technology through works: Sound Tunnel (1969) and The Sound The Shape of Pear (1970). Orr's piece Sunrise (1976), installed at Cirrus Gallery, was a continuation of his phenomenological investigations in Zero Mass. Sunrise \\"began to knit together the scientific and Egyptian strands, introducing silence, alongside space and light, as a third material. A room nine by nine by eighteen feet was built inside a gallery...sheathed with sheets of lead- which by screening out most radiation-created, inside, a partial cosmic-ray voice.... A ceiling channel at one end of the room extended through the rooftop of the outer building to a tracking device on the roof that followed the sun from dawn to dusk and reflected it, through the channel, onto the back interior wall of the lead-sheathed room.... Above all the 'lead box,' was a laboratory for certain types of exploration. Orr reconstructed it in his studio on the Venice beachfront, where it remained for several years.... Awareness of one's body, in that black silence, became overpoweringly absorbing while, at the same time, the sense of one's material boundaries receded.\\" He began to develop \\"flat rectangular objects to hang on walls. Some of them are clearly sculptures; others combine the genre characteristics of sculpture and painting...(his wall objects) involved an attempt to combine artwork with the power of object by merging inner powers of materials with their outer visual properties.\\" In 1981, he installed Silence and Ion Wind in the Hammer wing at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. In 1982, Orr's installation Double Vision was part of Documenta 7. Silence and the Ion Wind \\"was a kind of architectural-iconic allegory of the alchemical process, as one walked from leaden wall to golden room, from darkenss to light, from speech to silence.\\" Orr continued working on his wall objects, working with monochromatic color fields, working from both horizon, and void. 1990s In 1990, Orr produced an artist book Zero Mass in conjunction with a show at the Anders Tornberg Gallery, Sweden. This book included work of Orr's lifelong friend and collaborator James Lee Byars, and writing from Thomas McEvilley. Zero Mass is a comprehensive catalog of the artists' work. \\"The book itself has a blued steel spine connected by linen hinges to blued steel front and rear covers. This is accompanied by a James Lee Byars multiple: The Sphere of Generosity-a handmade fired ceramic sphere. These are each housed in a molded Styrofoam box, which is in turn inside a printed cardboard sleeve.\\" Electrum was another work that Orr produced in the '90s. Electrum is a large scale Tesla coil installed at Alan Gibbs' installation collection, Gibbs Farm in New Zealand. References=Inline citationsSources= *Butterfield, Jan. The Art of Light and Space.

It was one of the first keroncong groups in the colony. Members Various musicians are recorded as having been part of the Lief Java orchestra. This includes Ismail Marzuki, a singer-cum-songwriter known for his nationalist works; the blind singer Annie Landouw; and the theatrically-trained husband and wife team Kartolo and Roekiah. Other members included Hugo Dumas, Atjep, and Miss Netty. History Lief Java was established in 1918 by Soewardi as the Rukun Anggawe Santoso Orchestra before changing its name to Lief Java in 1923. The orchestra used a variety of instruments, including cellos, flutes, guitars, and violins. Most of the artists were amateurs, with little previous experience. The orchestra practiced in Kampung Kepuh, Kemayoran, Batavia (now Jakarta), in the home of musician S. Abdullah, and played a variety of songs, both originals and arrangements or adaptations. The company had two musical divisions, keroncong and jazz. Sometime after 1925, after Dutch entrepreneurs established NIROM, Lief Java began playing music over the radio as part of the station's Eastern Programme. This helped the orchestra to grow in popularity and reach new audiences outside of Batavia. Ultimately, however, the orchestra left NIROM owing to concerns over the use of their intellectual property; NIROM appropriated a song they had composed for use in opening all of their broadcasts. Thus, sometime after 1937 the orchestra quit NIROM and joined the rival station VORO (Vereeniging voor Oostersche Radio Omroep), playing live every Saturday. By the mid 1930s Hugo Dumas was the orchestra's leader. In 1938 Lief Java completed its first film score, working for Tan's Film on its production Fatima. As Roekiah was the main star of Tan's, the orchestra was retained to score the company's later releases. This included Gagak Item (1939) and Siti Akbari (1940). Some of the orchestra's singers, such as Kartolo and Landouw, joined the company as actors. The orchestra also toured; one trip, to Borneo in 1939, is known to have been a commercial success. During the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies, the troupe abandoned changed their name from the Dutch Lief Java to the Japanese Kireina Djawa. During this period the orchestra performed live on several occasions, and their songs became increasingly pro-East Asian. The orchestra was still in existence in 1949. Legacy An article in Pedoman Radio described the orchestra as \\"the 'mother' of the vocal and musical arts of Indonesia\\" (\\"'Ibu' seni-suara dan seni-musik Indonesia\\").

It is a member of Chicago Wilderness. The board of directors is also the board of Lake County. The directors are voted into office, and represent their respective districts in Lake County.  Introduction  The mission of the Lake County Forest Preserves is preservation, restoration, education and recreation. They protect about 31,000 acres of natural land and are the second largest Forest preserve service in Illinois. The Lake County Forest Preserve has a set 100 year plan. Their goal for this 100 year plan is to keep natural land safe and restore it. They want residents to take great pride in forest preserves, that their community provides.  History  Ethel Untermyer is considered the founder of Lake County Forest Preserves. Ethel and her son went exploring in the woods on day, in 1957. She was new to the lake county area and wanted to explore. She asked her friend where the nearest forest preserve was, and Ethel was shocked to find that there was none. She then organized a countywide public vote to create a Lake County Forest preserve district. Many people did not take into account of what she was doing. She kept telling people in her community about forest preserves and slowly gained support from many people. At this time Lake County just barely had 300,000 people and even then, people noticed the lack of natural land. By election day in November 1958, a handful of public support was shown in the community. The public vote passed with a surprising 60 percent of votes. As of then, Lake County Forest Preserve District was legally established in circuit court. A committee of citizens was then formed, with Ethel as its chair. In 1961 the first forest preserve opened in Lake County; Van Patten Woods in Wadsworth.  100-Year Plan  Lake County Forest Preserve envisions in 100 years that Lake County will be a healthy and thriving landscape with preserved natural lands, waters and cultural aspects. Residents will be able to take great honor in how their forest preserves help their communities. The healthy communities will thrive, and continue to through future generations that will protect these resources.  Recreation  Lake County Forest Preserve community provides many activities for the public and holds many events. The activities include; Biking on trails, paddling, dog parks, fishing, horseback riding, swimming, winter sports, and many more. There are many ways to get involved and create a healthy environment for many years to come. They want to provide a safe place for people to come and be with nature.  Preservation  The preservation foundation partners with Lake County Forest Preserves. It helps with the growth and development of the regions natural land. They fund projects that might otherwise go unfunded. When you support the Preservation Foundation, you provide your Lake County Forest Preserves to exist, grow and thrive.

Family Cordner's father, Ted, was a member of Melbourne's 1941 premiership team. Three uncles also played with Melbourne in the VFL, two-time best and fairest winner Denis, Brownlow Medalist Don and John, who also represented Victoria in cricket. David's grandfather, Edward, played twice for Melbourne in 1905 and appeared in a further 60 games with University. Career=Melbourne= A key forward, Cordner started his career in the Victorian Amateur Football Association, with Old Melburnians. Cordner had a prolific Under-19s season in 1981, when he kicked over 100 goals. This included a 12 goal haul in Melbourne's semi-final win over Hawthorn and five in their grand final win over Geelong. In his first two seasons with the seniors, Cordner struggled with injury, but in the 1984 VFL season put together 17 games. His 32 goals that year were bettered by only one teammate, Kelvin Templeton (51). He kicked seven goals against Fitzroy on the Melbourne Cricket Ground in the opening round of the 1985 season. For the rest of the season he kicked only 14 more goals, but he was also used as a defender. In 1986 he missed the early part of the season with a broken collarbone and only managed nine appearances that year. =Sydney= Cordner decided to change clubs in 1988, after making just one appearance for Melbourne in 1987. Talks were held with Geelong and Footscray, but it was the Sydney Swans that secured his services, on a one year contract.The Age, \\"Fitzroy aims for share of corporate dollars\\", 31 March 1988, p. 25Sydney Morning Herald, \\"Swans jump in to sign Cordner\\", 1 April 1988, p. 29 The Swans were looking for a key forward to cover the loss of Warwick Capper, who had gone to the Brisbane Bears.

It won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Nature Programming.Emily Yahr (Oct. 2, 2012). Washington Post, \\"PBS wins most News and Documentary Emmy Awards\\" It was based on the book Illumination in the Flatwoods by Joe Hutto, who also co-wrote and hosted the TV program. Synopsis My Life as a Turkey describes how Hutto raised a brood of wild turkeys. They imprinted on him as they came out of the egg. He then led them on walks through the Florida woods. He describes how he learned their language and was impressed by their instincts and native intelligence. Eventually, after about a year, they became independent of him. The film shows footage of turkeys at all these ages, and is a re-enactment of the material described in Hutto's book. Reception & media coverage In relation to the film, Joe Hutto has been profiled in newspapers, with a focus on the program and book. The book was mentioned in The New Yorker. Meaningful Quotes ‚ÄúTheir language and their understanding of the ecology shows a remarkable intelligence. But their ability to understand the world goes much further than just communication. I came to realize that these young turkeys in many ways were more conscious than I was. I actually felt a sort of embarrassment when I was in their presence - they were so in the moment - and ultimately their experience of that manifested in a kind of joy that I don‚Äôt experience and I was very envious of that. I was learning new things about turkeys everyday. But this was not just about how they live their lives - these animals were showing me how to live my life also. We do not have a privileged access to reality. So many of us live either in the past or in the future - and betray the moment. And in some sense we forget to live our lives - and the wild turkeys were aways reminding me to live my life. I think as humans we have this peculiar predisposition to be always thinking ahead - living a little bit in the future - anticipating the next minute, the next hour, the next day - and we betray the moment. Wild turkeys don‚Äôt do that. They are convinced that everything that they need, all their needs, will be met only in the present moment and in this space. The world is not better half mile through the woods, it‚Äôs not better an hour from now, and it‚Äôs not better tomorrow - that this is as good as it gets. So they constantly reminded me to do better, and to not live in this abstraction of the future, which by definition will never exist. And so we sort of betray our lives in the moment and the wild turkeys reminded me to be present, to be here.‚Äù \\"I learned many things - but maybe the most important was that we are essentially unaware of the overwhelming complexity that exists all around us. And I‚Äôll never see the world in the same way again.\\" Awards *Emmy - Outstanding Nature Programming (2012) *Jackson Hole Wildlife Film Festival - Best Writing (2011) ReferencesExternal links * * My Life as a Turkey (viewable at Daily Motion) * My Life as a Turkey (viewable online at PBS) * My Life as a Turkey (clips online at BBC) Category:Animals and humans Category:Documentary films about nature Category:Emmy Award-winning episodes ","title":"My Life as a Turkey"},{"id":"41553233","text":"\\"Feel Sick\\" is the fourth single released by Japanese rock band, The Teenage Kissers and the first single from their studio album, Virgin Field.

Sinhalese uses a vast collection of honorifics to reflect the speaker's relationship with the subject and object of the sentence and it also reveals the level of importance the society or the writer has given to them. In the present stage of the language, honorifics are mostly used in the literary language than in the vernacular, and is being gradually limited to the use in formal occasions. Noun Honorifics=Inanimate Nouns= When talking about an object that holds superiority or importance, or an object which has been given superior status, these honorifics are used. They can only be used in the literary language and play an essential part in Sinhala literature. Usually, the word is replaced by its \\"tatsama\\" counterpart for this, as in the word ‡∂ö‡∑ë‡∂∏-k«£ma (food) becomes the tatsama word ‡∂∑‡∑ù‡∂¢‡∂±-bh≈çjana (food) just to emphasize the given importance. The honorifics ‡∑Ñ‡∑î-hu and ‡∂ï-≈ç are usually used after this in plural form and the verb also is changed accordingly to its plural form, something that is not done to normal inanimate plurals. This changes the perspective of the object to the state the writer has given it, and thus advocates more beauty and grandeur to the sentence. Ex:‡∂≠‡∂ª‡∑î ‡∂Ö‡∑Ñ‡∑É‡∑ö ‡∂Ø‡∑í‡∂Ø‡∑î‡∂Ω‡∂∫‡∑í. tharu ahasƒì ƒëiƒëulayi. (the stars shine in the sky.)

(plural) When referring to the religious and holy objects or relics in Sinhala, the honorific ‡∑Ä‡∑Ñ‡∂±‡∑ä‡∑É‡∑ö-wahansƒì is sometimes used.‡∂¥‡∂±‡∑ä‡∑É‡∑í‡∂∫ ‡∂¥‡∂±‡∑É‡∑ä ‡∂¢‡∑è‡∂≠‡∂ö ‡∂¥‡∑ú‡∂≠‡∑ä ‡∑Ä‡∑Ñ‡∂±‡∑ä‡∑É‡∑ö: ‡∂Ö‡∂¥ ‡∂∑‡∑è‡∑Ä‡∑í‡∂≠ ‡∂ö‡∂ª‡∂± \\"‡∑Ä‡∑Ñ‡∂±‡∑ä‡∑É‡∑ö\\" ‡∂∫‡∂± ‡∂ú‡∑û‡∂ª‡∑Ä‡∑è‡∂ª‡∑ä‡∂Æ ‡∂¥‡∂Ø‡∂∫ ‡∂∏‡∑ô ‡∂∏‡∑ä ‡∂ú‡∑ä‚Äç‡∂ª‡∂±‡∑ä‡∂Æ‡∂∫ ‡∂ß ‡∑Ñ‡∑í‡∂∏‡∑í ‡∑Ä‡∑ì‡∂∏ ‡∂≠‡∑î‡∑Ö‡∑í‡∂±‡∑ä ‡∂∏ ‡∂ë‡∂∫ ‡∂∏‡∂±‡∑è ‡∑Ä ‡∂Ö‡∑Ä‡∂∂‡∑ù‡∂∞ ‡∑Ä‡∑ö.

Generally, elders, teachers, strangers, political/spiritual leaders, renowned people and customers in the Sinhala society are referred to with honorifics, while the younger people and students are not. The incorrect use of honorifics can lead to confusions, and are often thought as sarcastic remarks. Ex:When calling someone younger than you as ‡∂î‡∂∂ ‡∂≠‡∑î‡∂∏‡∑è-oba thumƒÅ it can mean that you are sarcastic about the younger one's boastful and prejudiced attitude. The most common honorifics in Sinhala language are ‡∑Ä‡∑Ñ‡∂±‡∑ä‡∑É‡∑ö-wahansƒì (venerable), ‡∑Ñ‡∑è‡∂∏‡∑î‡∂Ø‡∑î‡∂ª‡∑î‡∑Ä‡∑ù-hƒÅmuƒëuruw≈ç (monk/venerable), ‡∂≠‡∑ô‡∂∏‡∑ö-themƒì (sir), ‡∂≠‡∑ú‡∂∏‡∑ù-thom≈ç (madam), ‡∂∏‡∂∫‡∑è-mayƒÅ (Mr.), ‡∂∏‡∑í‡∂∫-miya (Mrs.), ‡∂ï-≈ç, ‡∑Ñ‡∑î-hu and ‡∂Ø‡∑ë-ƒë«£, with all of them joining at the end of a noun. The suffixes ‡∂Ü‡∂´-ƒÅ≈Üa, ‡∂Ö‡∂´‡∑î-a≈Üu, ‡∂Ö‡∂´‡∑í-a≈Üi used at the end of elders' names in the literary language also add honor to the salutations. As a rule, when using those 3 animate honorifics, the verb is always changed to its plural form.Shilpasayura-‡∂ú‡∑û‡∂ª‡∑Ä‡∑è‡∂ª‡∑ä‡∂Æ‡∂∫‡∑ö ‡∂∂‡∑Ñ‡∑ñ ‡∑Ä‡∂†‡∂± Ex:‡∂¥‡∑í‡∂∫-piya+‡∂Ü‡∂´-ƒÅ≈Üa+‡∂ï-≈ç -‡∂¥‡∑í‡∂∫‡∑è‡∂´‡∑ù-piyƒÅ≈Ü≈ç (father) ‡∂¥‡∑í‡∂∫‡∑è ‡∂ú‡∑ô‡∂Ø‡∂ª ‡∂ë‡∂∫‡∑í.-piyƒÅ geƒëara eyi.-(father comes home.) ‡∂¥‡∑í‡∂∫‡∑è‡∂´‡∑ù ‡∂ú‡∑ô‡∂Ø‡∂ª ‡∂ë‡∂≠‡∑í.-piyƒÅ≈Ü≈ç geƒëara ethi (father comes[come] home.) ‡∂¥‡∑î‡∂≠‡∑ä-puth+‡∂Ö‡∂´‡∑î-a≈Üu+‡∂ï-≈ç -‡∂¥‡∑î‡∂≠‡∂´‡∑î‡∑Ä‡∑ù-putha≈Üuw≈ç(son) ‡∂¥‡∑î‡∂≠‡∂´‡∑î‡∑Ä‡∑ù ‡∂¥‡∑è‡∂©‡∂∏‡∑ä ‡∂ö‡∂ª‡∂≠‡∑í.-putha≈Üuw≈ç pƒÅdam karathi.

Ex:‡∂ú‡∑í‡∂∫‡∑ö‡∂∫-giyƒìya(went) into ‡∂ú‡∑í‡∂∫‡∑Ñ-giyaha(went[plural]) However, when referring to a royal or a venerable, verbs are changed either into their unique honorific forms or their plural \\"tatsama\\" forms. Ex:‡∑Ñ‡∑í‡∂∏‡∑í-himi +‡∂ï-≈ç = ‡∑Ñ‡∑í‡∂∏‡∑í‡∂∫‡∑ù-himiy≈ç (venerable monk) ‡∂∏‡∂∏ ‡∂ö‡∑ë‡∂∏ ‡∂ö‡∑ë‡∑Ä‡∑ô‡∂∏‡∑í. -mama k«£ma [k«£wemi] (I [ate] supper.) ‡∑Ñ‡∑í‡∂∏‡∑í‡∂∫‡∑ù ‡∂Ø‡∂±‡∑ä ‡∑Ä‡∑Ö‡∂≥‡∂≠‡∑í.-himiy≈ç ƒëan [waƒºa≈àƒëathi] (the monk [eats] supper.) ‡∑Ñ‡∑í‡∂∏‡∑í‡∑Ä‡∂ª‡∑î ‡∂Ø‡∂±‡∑ä ‡∑Ä‡∑ê‡∑Ö‡∑ê‡∂≥‡∑ñ‡∑Ñ.-himiwaru ƒëan [w√¶ƒº√¶≈àƒë≈´ha].

The words ‡∑É‡∑ö‡∂ö-sƒìka and ‡∂Ø‡∑ë‡∂∫-ƒë«£ya are used at the end of the verbs in sentences beginning with the honorifics ‡∑Ä‡∑Ñ‡∂±‡∑ä‡∑É‡∑ö-wahansƒì and ‡∂Ø‡∑ë-ƒë«£ respectively. In Address and Request The honorific ‡∂±‡∑í-ni can be seen on formal salutations and in works of literature. Usually it is adjoined with the addressing honorifics ‡∂≠‡∑î‡∂∏‡∑è-thumƒÅ or ‡∂≠‡∑î‡∂∏‡∑ì-thumƒ´ Ex:‡∂Ø‡∑ô‡∑Ä‡∑í‡∂∫‡∂±‡∑í-ƒëewiyani (my god), ‡∂ú‡∑î‡∂ª‡∑î‡∂≠‡∑î‡∂∏‡∂±‡∑í-guruthumani (dear teacher), ‡∂ª‡∂¢‡∂≠‡∑î‡∂∏‡∂±‡∑í-rajathumani (my king)''' ‡∂±‡∑ö-nƒì is used when talking to give the same meaning:‡∂∂‡∑î‡∂Ø‡∑î‡∂±‡∑ö-buƒëunƒì (my lord buddha), ‡∂Ø‡∑ô‡∑Ä‡∑í‡∂∫‡∂±‡∑ö-ƒëewiyanƒì (my god), ‡∂¢‡∑ö‡∑É‡∑î‡∂±‡∑í-Jesuni (my Jesus), ‡∂Ö‡∂∏‡∑ä‡∂∏‡∑ö-ammƒì (dear mother). When requesting something to be done, ‡∂∏‡∑ê‡∂±‡∑Ä‡∑í-m√¶nawi is written at the end of a verb that is in order form. It is now only used in written works and historical plays.

In the early colloquial Sinhala, the honorific suffix ≈Üdi was used when addressing elder relatives and family members. After the colonial rule, these practices had been eventually abandoned.

Plot After the loss of his job and the break-up of his marriage, Junior (Marat Descartes) goes back to live with his father (Ant√¥nio Fagundes) at his former childhood home which is now completely refurbished. His bedroom is now occupied by a young and innocent tenant, Bruna (Sandy Leah). He feels a stranger at his father's place, which he finds quite inhospitable and oppressive. At first he sleeps on the couch and spends most of his days cooped up at home brooding over his separation, unemployment as well as spying on Bruna. However, his vulnerable personality takes a turn for the worse when he settles in a small back room cluttered with decorative remembrances of his late mum, which he resolutely puts back on display around the house much to his father's consternation. Among the things he recovers there is an old music score with a mysterious cryptographed message, the comprehension of which is the key to understanding his own past and present better. He gradually and irremediably becomes obsessed with his family's past, recalling amidst an intermixture of delusional disorder and grasps of reality his childhood days spent in the company of his older brother and mystical mother, while suspenseful obscure happenings concurrently become frequent in the house routine.http://www.adorocinema.com/filmes/filme-215567/> Cast *Ant√¥nio Fagundes as S√™nior *Marat Descartes as J√∫nior *Sandy Leah as Bruna *Gilda Nomacce as Miranda *Kiko Bertholini as Pedro *Helena Albergaria as Olga *Rony Koren as Paulinho *Tuna Dwek as Lurdinha *Eduardo Gomes as Zuzu ReferencesExternal links * Category:2014 thriller drama films Category:2014 films Category:Brazilian films Category:Brazilian thriller drama films Category:Films based on Brazilian novels Category:Films shot in S√£o Paulo Category:2014 drama films ","title":"Quando Eu Era Vivo"},{"id":"41553407","text":"LaGrange Lock and Dam is a lock and dam complex on the Illinois River at Versailles, Illinois.

He was educated at Christ's Hospital, and obtained an open exhibition at Balliol College, Oxford, 1864. He graduated B.A. in 1868 and M.A. in 1870. In 1871, Fyffe was elected a fellow of University College, and for many years acted as the bursar.

In 1870, in Macmillan's Magazine, he wrote that \\"Liberalism has become co-extensive with intelligence\\". His activism was influenced by T. H. Green. Fyffe held views as a land law reformer and was one of the founders of the free land league. His views on land reform were broadly supported by Sir Charles Dilke;The Spectator, 24 January 1885, Mr Fyffe's Pamphlet on the Land. they were more in line with the ideas of Henry George than those of Henry Hyndman, or the land nationalisation of Alfred Russel Wallace.Elwood P.

The game involves the player trying to reach an exit in several mazelike levels by solving counterintuitive puzzles, against the backdrop of a surreal narrative revolving around the search for the cure for cancer. The game saw recognition in the indie game community and was praised for its unique artistic style and atmosphere, though it was also criticized for its repetitiveness.  Gameplay  One of the cutscenes shown after each level. The game is characterized by minimalist graphics and surreal dialogue. In the opening cutscene, a character greets the nameless protagonist, who is stated to have applied to participate in researching the cure for cancer. It is then explained that the protagonist must first undergo a test. The game proper then begins. Each of the levels is a featureless, gray maze. The player, seeing the action in first-person view, must find his way to the exit. Doing so often involves deliberately disobeying instructions and overcoming unusual, counter-intuitive puzzle-solving challenges; for example, in the first level, the player finds himself in a looping corridor with arrows painted on the floor. Following the arrows leaves the player going in circles, but if he disobeys the arrows and goes backwards, he will end up at the exit. After the completion of each level, a short cutscene is shown which depicts a recording of a man loudly ranting, with his incomprehensible speech subtitled in ungrammatical English. Throughout his strange rants, the man tells how he has lost his father to cancer, which has driven him to devote his life to find a cure to the disease, only to finally realize that the only way to cure cancer is to \\"shoot it\\". In the game's final level, the protagonist finds himself in a room with the man previously seen in the cutscenes, who exclaims \\"I will cure you, cancer!\\" before shooting the protagonist.  Development  Mondo Medicals was created by the Swedish indie game developer Jonatan \\"cactus\\" S√∂derstr√∂m, known for creating highly unusual games, who had already gained notoriety with his 2008 game Clean Asia!. It was developed within 72 hours as an entry for a contest on the website TIGSource. The contest, bearing the theme \\"B-Games\\", challenged participants to create \\"bad games with great personalities\\". While most other contestants created deliberately ridiculous games, S√∂derstr√∂m decided he wanted to create a game that, while bizarre, could be taken seriously. The basic concept was to keep the player constantly deceived, with the entire game being deliberately enigmatic and cryptic in order to leave a lasting impression on the player beyond just entertaining them. The movies of the director David Lynch, known for his surreal films such as Eraserhead, were a major inspiration for the game. The dialogue was partially influenced by the games Portal and Killer7, as well as The Man from Another Place character from the TV series Twin Peaks. While initially the cutscenes were meant to provide verbally abusive commentary on the player's progress through the game, S√∂derstr√∂m eventually decided to instead make them follow a semi-coherent narrative.  Reception  Mondo Medicals was largely praised by video game journalists. Critics have commented on the game's confusing atmosphere and deliberately rough art style, and recommended the game for fans of horror and puzzle games. Retro Gamer's Stuart Hunt gave the game an 85% rating in his review, praising the eerie atmosphere, but criticizing the repetitive and monotonous level design. Mike Rose included the game in his book 250 Indie Games You Must Play. GameRadar's Lucas Sullivan compared Mondo Medicals to the later game Antichamber and described it as \\"the most fun you've ever had during an anxiety attack\\", while Jim Rossignol listed it among various \\"artsy games\\", calling it \\"an Eraserhead of gaming\\". A sequel to the game, Mondo Agency, was released on December 23, 2007. Another sequel was in development as of 2009, titled Mondo Wires; S√∂derstr√∂m also planned a compilation of all three games into an unified release, titled Mondo Nation. Mondo Medicals was later released as part of the game compilation Cactus Arcade. December 24, 2010 saw the release of a Macintosh port created by Leon Arnott.

(sometimes stylized as WAHOO!) was a United States-based corporation which built fiberglass recreational boats from 1985 to 1996. Wahoo! boats were built in Hanover Industrial Park, near Ashland, Virginia.  History  Wahoo! was founded in 1985 by Ray Curry, owner of Reliance Marine in Richmond, Virginia. While Reliance Marine had once been a Boston Whaler dealer, Curry founded Wahoo! to compete with Boston Whaler after having a falling out with them. By 1996, Curry had decided to retire and sold Wahoo! to Brunswick Corporation, who seemed interested in the company's hull molds and European style transom designs. Brunswick integrated the hull designs into their Robalo brand. Marine Products Corporation acquired the Wahoo! trademark when it purchased Robalo from Brunswick in June 2001.  Features  Wahoo! boats were designed to be self-bailing and included features like a built-in gas tank and a drainable hull considered innovative at that time for the types of boats they were building. Unlike similar boat designs, which had foam filled hulls, Wahoo! boats had hulls lined with foam, with a space between the hull liner foam and the cap foam. This design allowed the inner hull of the boats to be drained of moisture. While primarily made of fiberglass, wood was utilized in the transom and other locations for reinforcement.  Marketing  Wahoo! claimed its boats were unsinkable.

In December 2016, the Army of Mujahideen was briefly reorganized as Jabhat Ahl al-Sham (; Front of the People of the Levant), but this formation soon fell apart during rebel infighting in January 2017. Ideology The Army of Mujahideen did not have a political program. Although the member groups have an Islamist identity, they were largely non-ideological Free Syrian Army affiliated groups formed earlier in the Syrian Civil War. History Lieutenant Colonel Muhammad Juma Abdul Qader Bakur (nom de guerre \\"Abu Bakr\\"), commander of the 19th Division and the Army of Mujahideen The factions which formed the Army of Mujahideen largely emerged from the villages and towns of the Aleppo hinterland. The three groups at the core of the alliance were Division 19, the Fastaqim Union and the Nour al-Din al-Zanki Islamic Brigades, which was also then part of the Authenticity and Development Front. In March 2014, members of one of its component groups, the Fastaqim Union, stopped Marcell Shehwaro, a Syrian Christian opposition activist, and demanded her to wear a hijab. She refused and was arrested, taken to a Sharia court, and forced to sign an agreement pledging to wear the hijab. An Army of Mujahideen commander issued a statement apologizing for its fighters' violent actions, but the ruling requiring Shehwaro to wear a hijab still stood. On 4 May 2014, the Army of Mujahideen announced the withdrawal of the Nour al-Din al-Zanki Islamic Brigades from the coalition. On 3 June 2014, the Army of Mujahideen announced the expulsion of Division 19's Ansar Brigade and its leader, Abu Bakr, accusing them of theft and kidnapping. Charles Lister, of the Brookings Doha Center, described the Army of Mujahideen as being a shadow of its former self by August 2014, partially due to a reduction in support it had received from foreign states. Fastaqim Kama Umirt left the group around December 2014. In September 2014, the United States began planning weapon supplies to the group, and in the same month, fifty of the group's fighters were given military training in Qatar and supplied with BGM-71 TOW anti-tank missiles in a covert CIA program. On 6 May 2015, it, along with 13 other Aleppo-based groups, joined the Fatah Halab joint operations room. It announced its support to Turkey against the Kurdistan Workers Party. It also fights the Syrian Democratic Forces in Aleppo. Several factions of the group, including the al-Noor Islamic Movement, the Amjad al-Islam Brigade, and the al-Quds Brigades left to join the Revolutionaries of the Levant Battalions in April 2015. In December 2016, the Army of Mujahideen re-merged with Thuwar al- Sham Battalion and the Banner of Islam Movement to form Jabhat Ahl al-Sham. On 23 January 2017, the al-Nusra Front attacked Jabhat Ahl al-Sham bases in Atarib and other towns in western Aleppo. All the bases were captured and by 24 January, the group was defeated and joined Ahrar al-Sham.

Those selected received an all-expense-paid trip to San Antonio for rehearsals and performance. According to the National Association for Music Education, costs associated with the band were underwritten by several corporate sponsors, such as Jupiter Band Instruments, DeMoulin Bros. and Company, in addition to the United States Army Recruiting Command. Unlike other bands maintained by the U.S. Army, the U.S. Army All-American Band was a show band and did not engage in traditional military band functions, such as support for public duties or drill and ceremony. In 2019, the U.S. Army All-American Marching Band was discontinued.

Biography Batyanov was a graduate of the Sea Cadet Corps in 1852, and served with the Black Sea Fleet of the Imperial Russian Navy in the Caucasus campaigns of 1852-1854. As part of a naval infantry battalion, he distinguished himself at the Battle of Sevastopol during the Crimean War, where he was wounded. He was decorated with the Order of St Anne, 3rd class with swords (1854), and the Order of St Vladimir, 4th class with swords (1855) during the war. Afterwards, Batyanov transferred to the Imperial Russian Army, serving with the Imperial Guards followed by the Zhytomyr 56th Infantry Regiment in 1861. He was awarded the Gold Sword for Bravery in the campaigns against the Caucasus War in 1864 and was promoted to colonel in 1867 and commander of the Kabardian 80th Infantry Regiment. Promoted to adjutant in 1871, he participated in suppression of an uprising in the Terek region. Batyanov was awarded the Order of St George, 4th class in 1873 for his actions as a midshipman in the Crimean War. In 1877, Batyanov was promoted to major general, and the following year received command of the 2nd Brigade, 1st Grenadier Division. The following year, he received the Order of St Anne, 1st class and the Order of St Stanislaus, 1st class with swords. He was commander of the Third Infantry Brigade from 1881-1886. Promoted to lieutenant general, he then commanded the 13th and 23rd Infantry Divisions. In 1883, he was awarded the Order of St Vladimir, 2nd class. From 1893-1896, Batyanov was commander of the 12th Army Corps in the Kiev Military District. He introduced many innovations, including rapid-fire weapons (machine guns) and new tactics, placing strong emphasis on modernization of training. For this, he earned the strong disapproval of his superior, General Mikhail Dragomirov, who forced Batyanov into the reserves. However, Batyanov was reinstated only a year later, this time as commander of the 16th Army Corps, which he again attempted to modernize. In 1903, he was promoted to General of Infantry and appointed to the Military Council. During the Russo-Japanese War, he was appointed commander of the Third Manchuria Army in May 1905, page 77 replacing General Alexandr von Bilderling after the Battle of Mukden. He helped organize a new defensive line north of Mukden against a possible further Japanese offensive. Batyanov retired in January 1911 and died in Petrograd on 5 December 1916. His grave was at the Alexander Nevsky Lavra.

It was introduced in 1920 by Maurice Janet.M. Janet, Les syst√®mes d'√©quations aux d√©riv√©es partielles, Journal de math√©matiques pures et appliqu√©es 8 ser., t. 3 (1920), pages 65‚Äì123. It was first called the Janet basis by Fritz Schwarz in 1998.F. Schwarz, \\"Janet Bases for Symmetry Groups\\", in: Gr√∂bner Bases and Applications; Lecture Notes Series 251, London Mathematical Society, pages 221‚Äì234 (1998); B. Buchberger and F. Winkler, Edts. The left hand sides of such systems of equations may be considered as differential polynomials of a ring, and Janet's normal form as a special basis of the ideal that they generate. By abuse of language, this terminology will be applied both to the original system and the ideal of differential polynomials generated by the left hand sides. A Janet basis is the predecessor of a Gr√∂bner basis introduced by Bruno BuchbergerB. Buchberger, Ein algorithmisches Kriterium fuer die Loesbarkeit eines algebraischen Gleichungssystems, Aequ. Math. 4, 374‚Äì383(1970). for polynomial ideals. In order to generate a Janet basis for any given system of linear pde's a ranking of its derivatives must be provided; then the corresponding Janet basis is unique. If a system of linear pde's is given in terms of a Janet basis its differential dimension may easily be determined; it is a measure for the degree of indeterminacy of its general solution. In order to generate a Loewy decomposition of a system of linear pde's its Janet basis must be determined first.  Generating a Janet basis  Any system of linear homogeneous pde's is highly non-unique, e.g. an arbitrary linear combination of its elements may be added to the system without changing its solution set. A priori it is not known whether it has any nontrivial solutions. More generally, the degree of arbitrariness of its general solution is not known, i.e. how many undetermined constants or functions it may contain. These questions were the starting point of Janet's work; he considered systems of linear pde's in any number of dependent and independent variables and generated a normal form for them. Here mainly linear pde's in the plane with the coordinates x and y will be considered; the number of unknown functions is one or two. Most results described here may be generalized in an obvious way to any number of variables or functions.F. Schwarz, Algorithmic Lie Theory for Solving Linear Ordinary Differential Equations, Chapman & Hall/CRC, 2007 Chapter 2.W. Plesken, D. Robertz, Janet's approach to presentations and resolutions for polynomials and linear pdes, Archiv der Mathematik 84, pages 22‚Äì37, 2005.T. Oaku, T. Shimoyama, A Gr√∂bner Basis Method for Modules over Rings of Differential Operators, Journal of Symbolic Computation 18, pages 223‚Äì248, 1994. In order to generate a unique representation for a given system of linear pde's, at first a ranking of its derivatives must be defined. Definition A ranking of derivatives is a total ordering such that for any two derivatives \\\\delta, \\\\delta_1 and \\\\delta_2, and any derivation operator \\\\theta the relations \\\\delta\\\\leq\\\\theta\\\\delta and \\\\delta_1\\\\leq\\\\delta_2\\\\rightarrow\\\\delta\\\\delta_1\\\\leq\\\\delta\\\\delta_2 are valid. A derivative \\\\delta_2 is called higher than \\\\delta_1 if \\\\delta_2>\\\\delta_1. The highest derivative in an equation is called its leading derivative. For the derivatives up to order two of a single function z depending on x and y with x>y two possible order are : the LEX order z_{xx}>z_{xy}>z_x>z_{yy}>z_y>z and the GRLEX order z_{xx}>z_{xy}>z_{yy}>z_x>z_y>z. Here the usual notation \\\\partial_xz=z_x, \\\\partial_yz=z_y,\\\\ldots is used. If the number of functions is higher than one, these orderings have to be generalized appropriately, e.g. the orderings TOP or POT may be applied.W. Adams, P. Loustaunau, An introduction to Gr√∂bner bases, American Mathematical Society, Providence, 1994. The first basic operation to be applied in generating a Janet basis is the reduction of an equation e_1 w.r.t. another one e_2. In colloquial terms this means the following: Whenever a derivative of e_1 may be obtained from the leading derivative of e_2 by suitable differentiation, this differentiation is performed and the result is subtracted from e_1. Reduction w.r.t. a system of pde's means reduction w.r.t. all elements of the system. A system of linear pde's is called autoreduced if all possible reductions have been performed. The second basic operation for generating a Janet basis is the inclusion of integrability conditions. They are obtained as follows: If two equations e_1 and e_2 are such that by suitable differentiations two new equations may be obtained with like leading derivatives, by cross- multiplication with its leading coefficients and subtraction of the resulting equations a new equation is obtained, it is called an integrability condition. If by reduction w.r.t. the remaining equations of the system it does not vanish it is included as a new equation to the system. It may be shown that repeating these operations always terminates after a finite number of steps with a unique answer which is called the Janet basis for the input system. Janet has organized them in terms of the following algorithm. Janet's Algorithm Given a system of linear differential polynomials S\\\\equiv\\\\\\\\{e_1,e_2,\\\\ldots \\\\\\\\}, the Janet basis corresponding to S is returned. : S1: (Autoreduction) Assign S:=\\\\operatorname{Autoreduce}(S) : S2: (Completion) Assign S:=\\\\operatorname{CompleteSystem}(S) : S3: (Integrability conditions) Find all pairs of leading terms v_i of e_i and v_j of e_j such that differentiation w.r.t. a nonmultiplier x_{i_k} and multipliers x_{j_1},\\\\ldots,x_{j_l} leads to ::\\\\frac{\\\\partial v_i}{\\\\partial x_{i_k}}=\\\\frac{\\\\partial^{p_1+\\\\cdots+p_l}v_j} {\\\\partial x_{j_1}^{p_1}\\\\cdots \\\\partial x_{j_l}^{p_l}} and determine the integrability conditions ::c_{i,j} =\\\\operatorname{Lcoef}(e_j)\\\\cdot \\\\frac{\\\\partial e_i}{\\\\partial x_{i_k}}-\\\\operatorname{Lcoef}(e_i)\\\\cdot \\\\frac{\\\\partial^{p_1+\\\\cdots+p_l}e_j} {\\\\partial x_{j_1}^{p_1}\\\\cdots \\\\partial x_{j_l}^{p_l}} : S4: (Reduction of integrability conditions). For all c_{i,j} assign c_{i,j}:=\\\\operatorname{Reduce}(c_{i,j},S) : S5: (Termination?) If all c_{i,j} are zero return S, otherwise make the assignment S:=S\\\\cup\\\\\\\\{c_{i,j}\\\\mid c_{i,j} eq 0\\\\\\\\}, reorder S properly and goto S1 Here Autoreduce is a subalgorithm that returns its argument with all possible reductions performed, Completion adds certain equations to the system in order to facilitate determining the integrability conditions. To this end the variables are divides into multipliers and non-multipliers; details may be found in the above references. Upon successful termination a Janet basis for the input system will be returned. Example 1 Let the system \\\\left\\\\\\\\{e_1\\\\equiv z_{xy}-\\\\frac{x^2}{y^2}z_x-\\\\frac{x-y}{y^2}z=0, e_2\\\\equiv z_x+\\\\frac{1}{x}z_y+xz=0\\\\right\\\\\\\\} be given with ordering GRLEX and x>y. Step S1 returns the autoreduced system : \\\\left\\\\\\\\{e_3\\\\equiv z_{yy}+\\\\frac 1 {y^2}(xy^3-x^2-y)z_y-\\\\frac 1 y (x^3-x+y)z=0, e_2=z_x+\\\\frac 1 y z_y+xz=0\\\\right\\\\\\\\}. Steps S3 and S4 generate the integrability condition c_{3,2}\\\\equiv\\\\frac{\\\\partial e_3}{\\\\partial x}-\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2e_2}{\\\\partial y^2} and reduces it to z=0, i.e. the Janet basis for the originally given system is \\\\\\\\{z=0\\\\\\\\} with the trivial solution z=0. The next example involves two unknown functions w and z, both depending on x and y. Example 2 Consider the system : \\\\begin{align} \\\\Big\\\\\\\\{ & f_1 \\\\equiv w_{xx}-2z_{xy}-\\\\frac{1}{2x}w_x+\\\\frac{1}{2x^2}w=0, f_2\\\\equiv w_{xy}-\\\\frac{1}{2}z_{yy}-\\\\frac{1}{2x}w_y-6x^2z_x, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[5pt] & f_3\\\\equiv w_{yy}+4x^2w_x-8x^2z_y-8xw=0, f_4\\\\equiv z_{xx}+\\\\frac{1}{2x}z_x=0\\\\Big\\\\\\\\} \\\\end{align} in GRLEX, w>z,x>y ordering. The system is already autoreduced, i.e. step S1 returns it unchanged. Step S3 generates the two integrability conditions ::c_{1,2}\\\\equiv\\\\frac{\\\\partial f_1}{\\\\partial y}-\\\\frac{\\\\partial f_2}{\\\\partial x}\\\\text{ and }c_{2,3}\\\\equiv\\\\frac{\\\\partial f_2}{\\\\partial y}-\\\\frac{\\\\partial f_3}{\\\\partial x}. Upon reduction in step S4 they are ::c_{1,2}=z_{xyy}-6xz_x=0, c_{2,3}=z_{yyy}+3x^2z_{xy}-24xz_y-12w=0. In step S5 they are included into the system and the algorithms starts again with step S1 with the extended system. After a few more iterations finally the Janet basis ::\\\\left\\\\\\\\{z_y+\\\\frac 1 {2x}w=0,z_x=0,w_y=0,w_x-\\\\frac 1 x w=0\\\\right\\\\\\\\} is obtained. It yields the general solution z=C_1-C_2x, w=2C_2y with two undetermined constants C_1 and C_2.  Application of Janet bases  The most important application of a Janet basis is its use for deciding the degree of indeterminacy of a system of linear homogeneous partial differential equations. The answer in the above Example 1 is that the system under consideration allows only the trivial solution. In the second Example 2 a two- dimensional solution space is obtained. In general, the answer may be more involved, there may be infinitely many free constants in the general solution; they may be obtained from the Loewy decomposition of the respective Janet basis.F. Schwarz, Loewy Decomposition of Linear Differential Equations, Springer, 2013. Furthermore, the Janet basis of a module allows to read off a Janet basis for the syzygy module.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. It currently operates as the Stonewall Inn B & B. History The Frankfort Land Company began the development of the town of Frankfort in 1859. In the 1860s (likely 1867, but perhaps as early as 1860), they constructed this house to provide a residence for company officials living on site. However, the existence of the house‚Äîthe first stylish building constructed in the town‚Äîalso advertised the confidence the Land Company had in the potential and economic vitality of Frankfort. At some point in the 1870s, the house was sold to Hugh and Emily Marsh. They lived there until 1881, when Stephan Grubbs purchased it. He sold the house in 1885 to Elvira Bates, who moved in with Anna Alice Little, the daughter of a good friend. Anna married Henry Hills in 1885, and continued living in the house with her family and Elvira Bates. In 1888, Elvira deeded the house to Anna. Elvira died in 1900, and the Hills family moved to Grand Rapids in 1905. They rented the house for ten years. In 1915, the house was purchased by John J. and Caroline Bockoven of Grand Rapids as a summer retreat. Their son, John C. Bockoven, soon married and started a family, and continued to use the house, primarily in the summer. The family used the house until John C. Bockoven died; after which usage tapered off, ceasing entirely in about 1973. The house lay vacant until 1987, when John C. Bockoven Jr sold it at auction to a local antiques dealer, Ed Wichert. Edwin Wichert and his wife Mary Louise first sold most of the antiques remaining inside and bought out their limited partners so they could move in themselves. Starting with raising the foundation and taking apart the root cellar and horse's buggy garage, the Wicherts began restoring the house in 1993, leaving the style intact, but creating a liveable space for the proprietors separate from guests and building a carriage house around back. A variance was required to surround the courtyard with wrought-iron fencing and in 1996 a seal from the Department of Interior was placed outside the front entrance. The Bed & Breakfast was named for the original business that developed the Betsy Bay area, selling parcels to pioneers who wanted to homestead, while quietly offering midwife services to the families of sixty-nine babies delivered in the front parlor. The Wichert family opened it as the \\"Frankfort Land Co. Bed & Breakfast Inn.\\" The Frankfort Land Company house had dropped off the map of US Census after the 1970s. The Wichert family sold the house in 2001, the new owners then changed the name to the \\"Stonewall Inn B & B.\\" Description The Frankfort Land Company House is one of the best surviving examples of Italianate architecture in Benzie County. It is a two-story, T-shaped, hip roof structure with a single-story gable roof wing. Atop the main section is a square, hip roof belvedere. Decorative brackets are tucked under the eaves. The windows are long and narrow four-over-four double-hung type, framed with the original functional shutters. There is a bay window on one side.

Magnificently carved, this small ivory shrine depicts the 10 incarnations of Lord Vishnu, and is on display in the National Museum. This carved ivory shrine was made in the late 18th century. Dashavatara of Lord Vishnu is one of the most popular concepts of Hinduism, which has been widely worshiped by the Hindus in one or the other form.Dr. Manish Kumar Dwiwedi ‡§≠‡§æ‡§∞‡§§‡•Ä‡§Ø ‡§∏‡§æ‡§π‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‚Äç‡§Ø ‡§è‡§µ‡§Ç ‡§ï‡§≤‡§æ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§¶‡§∂‡§æ‡§µ‡§§‡§æ‡§∞. ‡§ï‡§≤‡§æ ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§ï‡§æ‡§∂‡§®. History The intricate carving and design places this shrine back to the late 18th or early 19th century. South India, used to be the hub of ivory craft, before it was banned in the country. Many artisans and craftsmen from various parts of south India (especially Trivandrum) specialized in carving ivory. Decorated with black paint, the screen and the base of the shrine shows the signature style of craftsmanship of Mysore school of ivory painting. However, ivory is a bone medium and so is forbidden to be worshiped in Hinduism. And so this raises the question as to why this shrine was carved in ivory. Base and background All the images are fixed on a painted stepped base made of sandalwood. The base, covered completely with ivory sheet has the traditional south Indian design of flowers and is decorated with several knobs fixed at the bottom step. Also two pillars support the fence in the background on both sides. The backdrop of the shrine is decorated with perforated ivory screen. These Jaalidar (lattice work) screens are divided in three parts by two small European style columns. An ivory strip on the wooden edges of the steps and base of the shrine depicts the foliage pattern. Images A closeup of the Dashavtars There are total 10 images, each depicting Lord Vishnu's avatars, carved in ivory. The topmost image is of the Matsya (Pisces) Avatar with four arms. The step below that holds Kurma (Tortoise) and Varaha (Boar) avatars, both with four arms. The third step has Narasimha, Vamana and Parashurama, and the images of Rama, Balarama, Krishna and Kalki incarnations are fixed on the bottom. All these images on the third and last base (except Narasimha and Kalki) have two arms. Matsya, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha and Kalki images are four armed, which conveys the idea of the God's supremacy. All of them hold sankha and chakra in their two hands, while the other two hands are in Abhayamudra and Varadamudra except Kalki, which holds a sword and a shield. Remaining images; Vamana, Parshurama, Rama, Balarama and Krishna are two armed and hold different attributes. Vamana holds umbrella and water vessel while Parashurama carries axe and bow. Rama holds bow and arrow and Balarama is carrying a mace with his other hand in Abhayamudra. Krishna is carrying the flute and Shankha in his two hands. All the incarnations are wearing dhoti as a lower garment and are adorned with jewellery like necklace, bangles, armlet and kirita mukuta except Vamana, who is without a crown.

In 1867 he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Queensland for Mitchell and was Queensland's Secretary for Public Lands from 1867 to 1868. A member of the Lamb banking family, he became a director of the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney (now National Australia Bank). His father Commander John Lamb was a Commercial Banking Company of Sydney director, as were his brothers Walter Lamb, Alfred Lamb and John de Villiers Lamb.

UNIGOV Amidst mounting nonviolent opposition of the SMC government run by Ignatius Kutu Acheampong, discussions of the country's political future had begun. A committee was set up by the Supreme Military Council in January 1977 to consider a \\"Union Government\\" proposal. Dr. Gustav Koranteng-Addow had toured the length and breadth of the country to collate views from the people on the Union government idea proposed by Acheampong. A report was presented on 4 October 1977 by the seventeen-member ad hoc committee appointed by the government and chaired by Dr. Gustav Koranteng-Addow. The report recommended an executive president selected by adult suffrage from a list presented by an electoral college. It also suggested a 140-member legislature of candidates who would run as independents without connection to a political party. In its report the committee said the predominant wish of the people was the establishment of a national government in a no party state. On 30 March 1978 a referendum was held on the choice of system of government. The results of the referendum saw an overwhelming support for the union government as those in favour of union government accounted for a little over 60% of the registered voters that voted. However, continuous strikes by professional groups and student bodies led to the overthrow of Ignatius Kutu Acheampong on July 1978.

He served as a judge of the Supreme Court of Ghana during the 2nd and 3rd Ghanaian Republics. Before serving as a judge, he did work as head of drafting at Ghana's Ministry of Justice and produced critical legislations to be passed by the early National Assembly. He established and headed an electoral commission, the first ever, to conduct the 1969 Ghanaian Election. Early life and education V.C.R.A.C Crabbe was born on 29 October 1923 at Ussher town in Accra, Gold Coast to Richard Arthur Crabbe, the Chief Registrar of the Courts (the most senior staff of the Judicial Service of the Gold Coast), and his wife Stella Akoley Lartey. Charles's father died eleven months after he was born. Crabbe attended the Government Junior Boys' School near the James Fort Prison and continued to the Government Senior Boys' Schools, Kinbu. In 1939 he entered the Accra Academy where he sat for the Cambridge Junior and Senior School Certificates, completing in 1943. Following this, he studied briefly at the Odumase Secondary School for six months. Crabbe then went to start work as a Second Division Clerk at the Headquarters of the Gold Coast Police Force. During the February 1948 riots, Charles was assigned to be part of the crowd, gathering intelligence for the Police Service. While working with the police, he studied privately for an Intermediate B.A. degree through correspondence with Wolsey Hall, Oxford. From 1950 to 1952, Crabbe studied Economics at the City of London College Moorgate, London. In August 1952, he was admitted to the Inner Temple to read law. He did so using the Senior Cambridge Certificate he had obtained from the Accra Academy. He completed the normal three-year course in two years and was called to the Bar on 8 February 1955 having being granted a dispensation. The same year he was enrolled as a member of the Gold Coast Bar. Career=Legislative Drafting and Elections= In 1955 Crabbe joined the Attorney-General's Department of Ghana starting out as an Assistant Crown Counsel. On 1 June 1958, he was appointed as a First Parliamentary Counsel, becoming the first African to be appointed one. He is also the only Ghanaian lawyer to have to been addressed as such, as the title was abolished in Ghana in favour of State Attorney after political independence. Together with the New Zealand lawyer Fred Boyce, he drafted the legislations, Ordinances and Acts of Parliament which were passed by the National Assembly on Ghana's Independence Day. In 1963, then president Nkrumah sent him on a mission to Uganda where he was made a First Parliamentary Counsel and Constitutional Advisor to the Uganda Government and drafted the 1966 Ugandan Constitution. In August 1968 he was appointed Interim Electoral Commissioner of Ghana to conduct the 1969 Elections. Crabbe set up the first ever electoral commission Ghana had ever had. He served as Special Commissioner to the 1969 Constitutional Commission and a Legislative Draftsman to the 1969 Constituent Assembly which drafted the 1969 Constitution of Ghana. He was Chairman of the 1979 Constituent Assembly and drafted the 1979 Constitution of Ghana. He worked with the Constitutional Review Commission of Kenya and was Leader of the group of Draftspersons who drafted the Kenya Constitution. He did work the Zambian Constititional Commission for the drafting of the Zambian Constitution as well with the Fiajoe Review Commission for the review of the 1992 Constitution of Ghana. Crabbe worked with Justice P.N. Bhagwati, former Chief Justice of India and Justice Kayode Eso of the Supreme Court of Nigeria to advise on the setting up of the Constitutional Court in South Africa. Crabbe was for many years sole Statute Law Revision Commissioner of Ghana and in this office revised the Laws of Ghana from 1852 to 2004 in seven volumes. He was a Co-Chair of the Coalition of Democratic Election Observers Ghana (CODEO) an agency under the Ghana Centre for Democratic Development (CDD-Ghana). =Service on the Bench= Crabbe was appointed a high court judge on 16 December 1966, soon after his return from Uganda. In 1968, when he was appointed as Interim Electoral Commissioner of Ghana, it was with the status of a Justice of the Court Appeal. In 1970, he was nominated and made a Supreme Court Judge of Ghana by prime minister Kofi Abrefa Busia. Following the military coup which toppled the Busia government in 1972, the supreme court was suspended. When the judicial system was restored Crabbe was not sent to the supreme court but returned to the high court. He served as a high court judge from 1972 to 1975. In 1976, he was sent to the court of appeal as a judge and in 1979 returned to the supreme court. =Contribution to Legal Education= From 1958 to 1963, Crabbe was a tutor and lecturer during the foundation years of the Ghana School of Law until he left for Uganda. He worked as a Senior Instructor at the International Law Development Centre in Rome, Italy. From 1974 to 1998, he was Director of the Commonwealth Secretariat Scheme for Legislative draftsmen for the West African Region, Southern Africa Region and the Caribbean Region. He was a professor of Legislative drafting at the Cave Hill Campus, Barbados of the University of West Indies.. Crabbe was a Professor of Law at Mountcrest University College in Accra until his death on 7 September 2018.  Personal life  Crabbe had six children. He was also a Freemason, belonging to the District Grand Lodge of Ghana under the United Grand Lodge of England. Honours In November 2013 he received an honorary doctorate from the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, after he had assisted the institution to establish its Faculty of Law. On 15 March 2017 he delivered an inaugural lecture on the theme, The Philosophy of Man after he was elected a Fellow of the Ghana Academy of Arts and Sciences. Death and state funeral  He died at the age of 94 on 7 September 2018 in Accra, Ghana.

The district population is included in the Delapre and Briar Hill Ward of Northampton Council. History The area was established as a small industrial site in the late 19th century. On the 1899 1:2500 Ordnance Survey map the site is located to the west and south of South Bridge over the River Nene between the river and the former Bedford to Northampton railway line and north of the Old Towcester Road and the former Bridge Street railway station (opened 1845). The area appears to have been entirely industrial in contrast to the area south of the railway line which is the residential area of Far Cotton. In the 1990s the area was cleared and used for housing with the name of Old Towcester Road changed to West Cotton Close. The area to the east of the original Cotton End is shown on the old Ordnance Survey map as having some industrial units close to the south bank of the river with a goods shed, other railway works and a pub and offices fronting the main road. This area was also referred to as Cotton End and became entirely industrial with removal of the railway sidings. During the 1990s part of this site fronting the river was also developed as housing off a new road called New South Bridge Road as the Old Towcester Road industrial development was out of date. Part of the site next to the river was occupied by a large iron foundry, Rice & Co, which was on the site from 1928-1997.Rice's Foundry History on Far Cotton History site, Accessed 6 January 2014 The Northampton Branch of the Grand Union Canal from Blisworth runs adjacent to the north of the site, just south of the River Nene, joining with the river via a lock. 1998 floods In April 1998, many residents of both Far Cotton and Cotton End had to leave their homes and seek temporary accommodation elsewhere, after part of the whole area, along with another part of Northampton, St. James, suffered flooding, when the River Nene broke its banks. Flooding occurred on Good Friday, 10 April 1998, a day which became known locally as \\"the long Good Friday\\". Since then river banks have been raised and flood mitigation lakes created west of the town.

Background Ena Poloa worked for Polymer Developments. After an internal investigation, it was reviled that Mr Poloa had misappropriated $374,000 from the company, which he later blamed on his egambling addiction. Poloa's brother, Katuni Tilialo, concerned that his brother would be convicted and sent to prison, contacted Polymer, offering to repay the misappropriated monies, with the inference that should he do so, that they would not get the police involved. Through his lawyers, Polymer accepted his repayment arrangement on his 3rd draft, and on 20 November 2000, the parties signed a Deed of Acknowledgement with the important clause of: The deed required Mr Tilialo to immediately pay $60,000, plus $15,000 every 6 months thereafter, which he paid the $60,000 plus one of the $15,000 instalments. Technically he paid the 2nd instalment as well, but in an unwise move he gave that $15,000 to his brother (the one with the gambling problem) to pass on to Polymer, which unfortunately (and not very surprising) he lost gambling. After Mr Tilialo made no further payments, Polymer sued him in court for the balance left owing under the deed, which Tilialo defended on the grounds that it was an illegal contract, and so is not legally enforceable. Tilialo also sought the court to order Polymer to refund the monies he had already paid. Held Polymer argued that the agreement was merely to stop them commencing a private prosecution (they claimed the reference to \\"criminal\\" in the agreement was an oversight) and not a police prosecution, and so was not against public policy of hindering justice. However the judge saw little legal distinction between a private and a public prosecution where Glazebrook J said: The judge had little problem in setting aside the deed as void and as of no effect. Both parties however had sought relief from the court under the Illegal Contracts Act [1970], with Polymer seeking to keep the $75,000 already paid as well as payment of the remaining instalments, and Tilialo sought the return of the monies already paid. The judge ordered validation and variation of the deed, validation of the $75,000 already paid, meaning Polymer did not have to refund this, and granted relief to Tilialo in that he only needed to make 3 further instalments of $15,000, plus a final payment of $5,000. Whilst courts rarely grant such relief in such cases, the judge, in deciding to make Mr Tilialo to pay something under such an agreement, took into account the important aspects here that firstly it was Mr Tilialo was the one whom first offered to pay (and not Polymer), that Mr Tilialo employed solicitors to negotiate the deed, so arguably he had proper legal advice, furthermore Mr Tilialo was also a person who was very used to legal documentation and to consulting solicitors in the course of his work and that Polymer signed the deed in the form presented under pressure from Mr Tilialo to do so at a meeting where Polymers Managing Director was unavailable and when Mr Tilialo would have been aware of that fact.

Ohene Djan was the First Director (Minister) of Sports of Ghana at the Central Organisation of Sports (COS) and was also vice-president of the Confederation of African Football. Early years and education He was born on 29 January 1924 as one of the children of Mankrado Kwafo Kraba II and Aberewatia Juliana Yaa Amponsah Otoo alias Yaa Gyinae both from Aburi, Eastern Region. His education begun at the Aburi Presbyterian Primary School and Aburi Methodist Boarding School. He later continued to the Accra Academy where he obtained his secondary education, completing in 1943. Career After his secondary school education, he joined his father in his cocoa business. He worked with his father for a year and joined the civil service as a second division clerk. His father's deteriorating health forced him to resign in 1949 to manage his father's business. The agitation of 1950 resulted in Ohene Djan becoming an active member of the CPP; the party founded by Dr. Kwame Nkrumah Ghana's first head of State. In the 1951 general elections he stood on the ticket of the CPP and was elected as its member for the Akuapem/New Juaben constituency beating Edward Akufo-Addo by 97 to 12 votes. In parliament he was appointed ministerial secretary to the ministry of Finance. He held that office until 1954 when he left Parliament due to corruption charges that were leveled against him. Djan's journey to the helm of sports affairs in Ghana begun in September 1957, when he was elected General Secretary of the Football Association by the clubs and the Ghana Amateur Football Association (GAFA). He had led a revolution that had toppled the administration of Richard Akwei, a respected politician who had ruled football in Ghana - then known as Gold Coast officially since 1952 and unofficially for many years before then. He founded the Black Stars, Ghana's famous national team, and he strategically affiliated the Association with FIFA in 1958 and the CAF in 1960. He was instrumental in securing sponsorship for the first Ghanaian FA Cup competition from a pharmaceutical firm, Merrs R.R. Harding and Company. He succeeded in securing the services of an expatriate Coach, George Ainsley, for the National Team in that same year. In 1958, he succeeded again in organizing the first national league, before Ghana became a republic on 1 July 1960. In July 1960, Ghana's first President, Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, elevated Djan to the ministerial portfolio of 'Director of Sports' - the overall boss of sports administration in Ghana. He was in charge of the newly created Central Organisation of Sports (COS) (now the Ministry of Youth and Sports (Ghana)), a sports ministry-like organization. Although Djan left his GAFA chairmanship post due to this promotion, he continued to play a key role as General Secretary. Djan's reputation grew on the continent, his lobbying helped Ghana gain the hosting rights for the 1963 African Cup of Nations which the Black Stars won (the Black Stars went on to defend the trophy in Tunisia in 1965 under his tenure of leadership). He also suggested to Nkrumah to donate a trophy for a tournament that is now known as the CAF Champions League. At a CAF extraordinary assembly in Addis Ababa he became second in command of the continent's highest football administrative body, emerging as CAF vice president alongside Ethiopia's Ydnekatchew Tessema in January, 1963. They both served under Egyptian Abdel Aziz Moustafa, the CAF president. A year earlier, Djan had been voted unto the powerful FIFA Executive Committee (now known as the FIFA Executive Council). Sir Stanley Rous, FIFA's president then, described Djan as a 'valued' player at the World football governing body.S. K Osei,\\"Meet the Ghanaian who became CAF Vice President 54 years before Kwesi Nyantakyi\\", ghanaweb, 10-05-2017. Aside football Ghana made giant strides in other sporting disciplines in his era as a Sports administrator. Ghana produced a silver medalist at the 1960 Summer Olympics in the name of Clement Quartey he became the first black African olympic medalist. Ghana was also the African country that won the most medals in the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games. Due to the influential role he played in Nkrumah's government, Djan was banned from public activities by the National Liberation Council, the military junta that undertook the coup of 1966, thus resulting in a loss of his place on the FIFA Executive Committee and subsequently, at CAF too. With the spotlight dimmed, Djan's power and activeness declined, and he spent the ensuing years away from mainstream football politics.S. K Osei,\\"Meet the Ghanaian who became CAF Vice President 54 years before Kwesi Nyantakyi\\", ghanaweb, 10-05-2017. The 1966 FIFA World Cup Boycott In January 1964, FIFA decided that the 16-team finals would be represented by 10 European teams, including hosts England, four Latin American (i.e. South America) teams and one team from the Central American and Caribbean region. This left just one place to be fought for by three continents: Africa, Asia and Oceania. Within a month, Ohene Djan, Ghana‚Äôs Director of Sports and also a member of the FIFA executives committee objected. He sent a telegram to FIFA condemning the decision and calling it \\"pathetic\\". Ohene Djan challenged FIFA to reconsider the decision since it was unrealistic for Afro-Asian countries to go through the exercise, struggling through painful and expensive qualifying series to ultimately be offered one slot to fight for. Tessema joined Djan to present Africa's case to FIFA, arguing that football in Africa had significantly improved over the years, however all efforts to revoke the decision in their favour proved futile. FIFA went on to organise the 1966 FIFA World Cup without an African representative. North Korea won the slot and they put up an impressive performance in the tournament. Moreover, an African player from colonial Mozambique, Eusebio, who played for Portugal was the leading scorer at the tournament. FIFA revised its notes and decided that Africa should have one slot for the 1970 World Cup. Today, Africa has five slots in the Worldcup.Razak El-Alawa,\\"Let‚Äôs give Ohene Djan his due\\", graphic online, 23 July 2016.

It stands on the site of the former Convento de la Trinidad established shortly after Fernando III conquered the city in 1236. Built in the Baroque style, it forms part of the Historic centre of C√≥rdoba, a UNESCO World Heritage site. History It is believed the original church and convent were built on the site of a mosque although nothing remains of it. Nor are there any remains of the Church of San Juan de los Caballeros which remained after the convent was disbanded. There are however records of the roof collapsing in the 16th century and of its subsequent repair funded by Don Martin de C√≥rdoba. After the building again fell into disrepair, it was decided to build a completely new church which was consecrated on Trinity Sunday in 1705. The Baroque building is constructed in the form of a Latin cross with a nave covered by a barrel-vaulted ceiling decorated with painted lunettes. The dome above the transept is supported by pendentives. The church's artwork includes a figure of Christ the Saviour (Santo Cristo de la Salud) from 1590 carved by an anonymous author. It was brought from the former convent church of the Order of the Trinity (Orden Trinitaria) which used to be located in the V√≠a Crucis. Recent paintings from the nearby Cofraf√≠a de la Santa Faz monastery include Nuestro Padre Jes√∫s Nazerano by Antonio Dub√© de Luque and Mar√≠a Sant√≠sima de la Trinidad by Antonio Salto. The decorations surrounding the church's entrance contrast with its whitewashed facade topped with a triangular pediment and two oculi. The portal consists of a Romanesque arch flanked by double Doric columns with a frieze of triglyphs and metopes. The upper section with Solomonic columns contains group of sculptures in a niche with an angel in a Trinity robe assisting two captives. The square-shaped sacristy is decorated with several notable murals by Antonio Palomino (1653‚Äì1726). They depict scenes from the Old Testament associated with the Eucharist. The church's altarpieces are also decorated with a number of works from the 17th and 18th centuries.

Life Born at Westgate Street, Bath, Somerset on Good Friday 1793, he was the eldest son of Francis Kilvert, coachmaker, and Anna his wife; his uncle was Richard Kilvert, domestic chaplain to Bishop Richard Hurd and rector of Hartlebury. Orphaned while still young, and the eldest of seven sons, he became guardian to his brothers. For a time he was educated under Dr. Michael Rowlandson at Hungerford. He then went to the Bath grammar school, where Nathaniel Morgan had him as an assistant. He matriculated at Worcester College, Oxford, on 6 November 1811, and graduated B.A. in 1819 and M.A. in 1824. Kilvert was ordained deacon by Richard Beadon, bishop of Bath and Wells, in 1816, and priest in 1817; his first curacy was at Claverton, near Bath. He declined the post of principal of Queen's College, Birmingham, stayed in Bath, and took on minor posts, including minister of St. Mary Magdalen's Chapel, chaplain of the General Hospital, and evening lecturer at St. Mary's, Bathwick. His main income came from keeping pupils. In 1837 Kilvert bought Claverton Lodge, on the southern slope of Bathwick Hill, where he took scholars for the rest of his life. Kilvert was one of the earliest members of the Bath Literary Club. He died at Claverton Lodge on 16 September 1863, and was buried in Old Widcombe churchyard, near the grave of his father and two of his brothers. A brass tablet to his memory was placed on the walls of St. Mary, Bathwick.

The reform proposals was first carried out in the Green Paper: the Further Development of Representative Government in Hong Kong in July 1984 right before the Sino-British Joint Declaration in December. The reform laid the foundation of the representative democracy in Hong Kong which developed throughout the last years of the colonial rule and succeeded by the democratic development in Hong Kong after the handover of Hong Kong in 1997. Background The Green Paper: A Pattern of District Administration in Hong Kong was published in July 1984 before the Sino-British negotiations over the sovereignty of Hong Kong began which marked the intention of first large-scale constitutional reform in the colonial history. The 1980 Green Paper stated the continual evolution of the government system including the Executive Council and the Legislative Council. The formation of the District Boards and the first direct election in 1982 were followed by the 1980 Green Paper. In 1983 the membership of the Urban Council was increased to 30, half of whom were elected from direct constituencies on the further extended franchises. A further democratic reform was considered in the Green Paper of 1984 published in July, months before the Sino-British Joint Declaration was signed which the United Kingdom and the People's Republic of China governments agreed on handing over Hong Kong from British to Chinese rule in 1997. Green Paper The Green Paper: the Further Development of Representative Government in Hong Kong was published by the Hong Kong government in June 1984 proposed a further representative government. The main aims of the proposals were: # to develop progressively a system of government the authority the authority for which is firmly rooted in Hong Kong, which is able to represent authoritatively the views of the people of Hong Kong, and which is more directly accountable to the people of Hong Kong; # to build this system on our existing institution, which have served Hong Kong well, and as far as possible, to preserve their best features, including the maintenance of the well established practice of government by consensus; and # to allow for further development if that should be the wish of the community. The main issues for consideration were the role, functions or composition of the Legislative Council, the Executive Council and the position of the Governor. =Legislative Council= The Green Paper suggested the introduction of the indirect election in two stages in 1985 and 1988 to the unofficial members in the Legislative Council by an electoral college of Urban Council of Hong Kong, new Regional Council to be established in 1986, and District Board members and by functional groups or functional constituencies. It also suggested the length of term for the unofficial members should be three years. Furthermore, the number of the official members and appointed unofficial members was considered to be gradually reduced as the number of the indirect elected unofficial members was increased. The Green Paper indicated a review to consider the possibility of direct election on a constituency basis or a single territory-wide list. =Executive Council= The Green Paper suggested the introduction of a representative element into the Executive Council by proposing an indirect election of the unofficial members of the Executive Council by the unofficial members of the Legislative Council. =Governor= The Green Paper suggested the Governor's power to appoint members of the Executive and Legislative Councils to be limited. It also suggested Governor to cease to be the President of the Legislative Council. The power of the Governor to oppose to the advice of the Executive Council was also considered to be removed. White Paper A two-month period was allowed for public consultation on the Green Paper proposals. In addition to over 360 written submission from various organizations, groups and individuals. Many meetings and public discussions were attended by government officers, several surveys of public opinion were carried out and the public was generally in favour of the aims of the Green Paper. Comments were received from many members of District Boards, Area Committees and Mutual Aid Committees. Urban Councillors expressed their views in an open debate on 4 and 6 September 1984, which was followed up by a Resolution from the Standing Committee of the Whole Council on 27 September 1984. and Unofficial Members of the Legislative Council commented on the proposals during the debate in the Legislative Council on 2 August 1984. =General reactions= The White Paper: the Further Development of Representative Government in Hong Kong was published in November 1984, summing up the public responses to the constitutional reform proposal. The ideas of an electoral college and functional constituencies for the election of the unofficial members of the Legislative Council were adopted. However the government concluded that \\"there was little evidence of support in public comment on the Green Paper for any move towards direct elections in 1985.\\" There was much less comment on the Executive Council proposals than on the Legislative Council. It was not proposed to make any changes affecting the Executive Council in 1985. The idea of replacing the Governor as President of the Legislative Council by an elected Presiding Officer was generally received, but the general view was in favour of making no significant changes in the position of the Governor during the next few years. =Electoral college= Under the White Paper proposals, the electoral college comprised all members of the District Boards, the Urban Council and the new Regional Council. The college would elect 12 Unofficial members to the Legislative Council in September 1985. In order to achieve a more balanced and adequate representation the District Boards would be grouped into ten geographical constituencies each representing approximately 500 000 people. The remaining two seats would be provided by the two special constituencies formed respectively by members of the Urban Council and the Regional Council. The interests of the Heung Yee Kuk would be represented through the Regional Council. =Functional constituencies= Nine functional constituencies would return an overall total of 12 unofficial members to the Legislative Council in the elections planned for September 1985. The commercial, industrial, and labour constituencies would each return two unofficial members to the Legislative Council. The remaining six constituencies would each return one Unofficial member. Electoral Provisions Bill The Legislative Council (Electoral Provisions) Bill 1985 was introduced into the Legislative Council in early 1985 and was passed on 3 April 1985 with the support of the unofficial members. The first Legislative Council elections were subsequently held in September 1985.

The publication is the oldest photographic periodical in the world.Gernsheim, H, Incunabula of British Photographic Literature, p. 131. The claim was until recently disputed by the British Journal of Photography which first appeared on 14 January 1854. For much of the magazine's history it had an influence that went far beyond the society and a print run considerably in excess of the society's membership. The magazine has had its circulation ABC audited since 2010. From June 2014 Think Publishing took on responsibility for publishing the journal on the society's behalf. The Photographic Journal is not affiliated with ThePhotographicJournal.com, which is an online publication that began in 2013.  Editors  The first editor-in-chief was Arthur Henfry FRS FLS. When Roger Fenton retired as the society's secretary in January 1856 the role of editor and secretary was combined. The Rev. J. R. Major was elected to the post which he held until June 1857 when William Crookes replaced him. In August 1856 Hugh Welch Diamond took over from Crookes who founded his own journal, Photographic News.

It also included ideas other photographers had to help improve their own practice, in a sort of \\"letter to the editor\\" style, as well as responses to questions. In addition, it also had a strong interest in scientific photography, particularly under Abney's editorship. From January 1948, the Photographic Journal was split into Part A: Pictorial and Section B: Scientific. In 1953 the latter became the Journal of Photographic Science, now The Imaging Science Journal.

Runs of the magazine are available in major libraries in the United Kingdom, including the British Library and in the society's own library housed at the National Media Museum.

Life Born in Coventry, he grew up in Wyken, where his father was a machine-setter at Morris Motors. As a child, he experienced twenty-five German raids in The Blitz in nine months. He was educated at King Henry VIII School. Shaw first trained as a reporter on The Coventry Standard, under the painstakingly prosaic editorship of former BBC correspondent Edgar Letts, who, regularly troubled by Shaw's copy, was often to be heard asking the chief reporter, \\"Do you this can be possibly true?\\". Shaw went on to gain an honours degree in arts (with first-class honours in English Literature) at The University of Leeds, supplementing his grant with work as a correspondent for the Manchester office of Melody Maker and as a freelance for the Yorkshire Evening Post. Shaw's two years as a conscript in the Army included periods at the Joint Services School for Linguists run by the Services' Intelligence arm, and, briefly, the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, on posting from which he reverted to private. His final year's service - at the Cavalry Barracks, York - was marked by offences \\"against military order and good discipline\\". For some years he then taught English in schools and in adult education for the Workers' Educational Association. From 1964 to 1968 he combined being Head of English and Sixth Form at the Leeds Modern School, with a part-time Tutorship at Leeds University and a Visiting Fellowship at The University of York. From 1968 to 1972 he was Lecturer at The University of Southampton.Geoffrey Summerfield and Stephen Tunnicliffe, editors, English in Practice, Cambridge, University of Cambridge Press, 1970, chapter by Robert Shaw, pages 130‚Äì163 In 1972 he became a freelance, returning to Yorkshire, to the Pennine village of Haworth where his wife, the studio-potter Anne Shaw, had set up Haworth Pottery. Shaw toured Britain, from the Isle of Wight to Pitlochry, giving \\"readings\\" of his poems, sometimes with jazz. He also reviewed, wrote for television and radio, contributed literary criticism and edited The Yorkshire Review for the regional arts association.Robert Shaw, editor, 1976, Yorkshire Review, numbers 1‚Äì4, Bradford, Yorkshire Arts Association The magazine was reviewed by Robert Nye in The Times as \\"distinguished\\" with \\"an attractive catholicity\\". His summary dismissal, without notice, followed his rejection of contributions from two members of the controlling Literature Panel. His creative attachments included the USA's Northwest University, new towns, community projects and academic institutions. From 1992 to 2011 his creative energies were diverted to playing jazz, spending long periods performing in France, Spain and the Irish Republic. Poetry ‚Äì and Jazz  Shaw's first poems were published in periodicals while a student at Leeds. However, becoming involved in the late fifties and early sixties, in anti-nuclear protest, with the Committee of 100 and Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, with his wife, Anne Shaw, a Civil Disobedience activist who illegally distributed the government's secret Spies for Peace document, he did not resume literary work again until 1965. His early work ‚Äì Private Time, Public Time,1969, illustrated by Rigby Graham and published with the financial support of The Arts Council of Great Britain, Causes,1972, and Work in Progress, 1975, was complex and cerebral, with considerable use of ambiguity, but The Wrath Valley Anthology, 1981, with Grindley's Bairns, 1988, marked a more direct, colloquial, even \\"reductive\\" approach to irony. The Times Literary Supplement commented, \\"His wry humour produces a refreshing antidote to the bleak treatment that region (The Pennines) regularly provokes. He can include in his characteristic irony a sense of the predicament of suburban exile. His charmless eccentrics are treated with respect as well as irony.\\"21 June 1981, unsigned, volume 14, number 2, page 751 His major works (except Causes, from The Byron Press) continued to be published by Alan Tarling's Poet & Printer, a small publishing house.Alan Tarling, Titlles from a Poetry Press, Middlesex, Poet & Printer Press 1990 In addition, smaller collections like Poems from Haworth, The Lead Age, and Masquerade appeared from fugitive private presses. Shaw compiled and edited, with a critical survey, the anthology of modern British poetry, Flash Point, 1964, and was himself anthologised in Brian Patten and Pat Krett's The House that Jack Built. Two of his poems ‚Äì we are going to need poems and A North Country Lass Tells Her Sorrows ‚Äì were designed as poster-poems by Rigby Graham and Roy Sandford. In 1981 the BBC commissioned a long poem. His reading of this was used as background to a BBC 2 television film about his work in its Pennine setting. His last published collection, in 2000, was Catullus: The Love-Hate Poems Translated by Robert Shaw, in free verse. Shaw is also a jazz saxophonist, chiefly on tenor (with clarinet), sometimes alto and, unusually, c-melody. His approach to tone and harmony derived from the later, less influential style of Lester Young. He had had a youthful, essential jazz education in the influential rehearsal big band of top trumpeter, Cyril Narbeth. Shaw has experimented in combining poetry with jazz role in the poetry&jazz; project. He was the originator, director and poet, as well as performer of poems. He hired musicians, discussed the poems with them, and sketched the possible jazz responses but left the final musical detail to them. He wanted their improvisation, the defining characteristic of jazz, to interact with his \\"readings\\" in public performance. The jazzmen were drawn from leading modern jazz groups like those of Ronnie Scott, John Dankworth and Mike Westbrook and the British band of Maynard Ferguson. (Bassist Jeff Clyne, who played a number of engagements with the poetry&jazz; touring outfit in 1974, was a member of the Stan Tracey Quartet which made the 1965 classic jazz album inspired by Under Milk Wood.) A typical programme included straight jazz, poems on their own and, the major ingredient, poetry&jazz; fusion. The package broadcast and played a variety of arts and jazz venues, touring Britain extensively from 1972 to 1983, as New Poetry&Jazz; (in London, The South and Midlands) and Northern Poetry&Jazz; (in The North and Scotland) attracting new followers to both forms.Eric Goarfoot, 8 November 1976, P&J; Pulls in New Fans, The Jazz Messenger. The most settled collaboration was the two years with the Dick Hawdon Quintet. A representative performance (which received three stars in The Virgin Encyclopedia of Jazz) can be heard on The Yorkshire Arts Association LP, Poetry&Jazz; on Record ‚Äì The Dick Hawden (sic) Quintet with Pete Morgan and Robert Shaw.Colin Larkin, editor, The Virgin Encyclopedia of Jazz. Virgin Books with Maze UK, 1999, pages 384‚Äì5. During a brief revival of touring in the East Midlands 2000‚Äì2002 a recording was made of new material, a sequence of verse portraits by Shaw of great jazzmen set against a duo performance of a number associated with each. The duo consisted of Shaw on reeds and Angharad Griffiths on keyboard. In the early 80's Leeds College of Music recorded an Electro-Acoustic Setting by Bill Charleson of 3 Poems by Robert Shaw. Subsequently it was used as part of a thesis presented at the University of York by Charleson.

History  Its ruins were located in the territory of Palmi. The city's name derives from the Italic peoples who founded it, the Tauriani. The city, which stood on the south bank of the river Metauros (probably Petrace), marked the border of the territory of Reggio Calabria on the Tyrrhenian coast north-west, which began more than that of Locri.

Geography = Location = Johanniskreuz lies in a saddle at about , north of the midpoint of the central massif of the Palatine Forest, the Frankenweide, whose surrounding peaks are only a little higher. The Frankenweide, across which the Palatine Watershed runs, is bounded to the west, north and east in the area of Johanniskreuz by the valleys of streams that rise near the hamlet. Immediately west of Johanniskreuz is the source of the Moosalb, a tributary of the Schwarzbach, which itself rises one kilometre southwest of Johanniskreuz. The waters of these streams initially flow westwards through the Blies and Saar rivers into the River Moselle and then on to the Rhine. A little to the east of Johanniskreuz is the source of another Schwarzbach, this time the left-hand headstream of the Speyerbach; which flows eastwards, directly to the Rhine. The municipal centre of Trippstadt is about 4.5 kilometres away as the crow flies. The municipal boundary between Trippstadt and Elmstein, as well as the county boundary between Kaiserslautern and Bad D√ºrkheim, runs immediately east of the hamlet. = Climate = The annual precipitation in Johanniskreuz is 1,005 mm and thus lies in the upper quadrant of values within Germany. The driest month is September; the most precipitation falls in December, i.e. 1.6-times as much as in September.  History = Name = In the foreground is a so-called Ritterstein. Behind: the stone crosses The name of the parish may go back to Johannes von Wilenstein. He was a liege lord (German: Lehnsherr) at the nearby castle and, in 1269, he had his coat of arms inscribed as a boundary marker ‚Äì apparently illegally ‚Äì on an existing wayside cross (Flurkreuz) which belonged to the lords of Hohenecken. Lord John's Cross (Herrn Johanns Creutz) is first mentioned in the records in 1551. Only remnants of the oldest cross have survived; two crosses of more recent date were placed beside it. Since the district reform of 1972 Johanniskreuz has belonged entirely to the municipality of Trippstadt; before that several of the houses, based on the historic boundaries, were in the parish of Wilgartswiesen. = Palatine Forest = At a meeting of Palatine forest officials in Johanniskreuz in August 1843 the name Pf√§lzerwald (\\"Palatine Forest\\") was given to the northern part of the Vosges mountains. In a way Johanniskreuz is thus the \\"birthplace\\" of the Palatine Forest which, until the early 20th century was counted as part of the Vosges or Wasgenwald in most travel literature. = Roman Catholic Convention = Advertisement for the Catholic Convention at Johanniskreuz in 1931 with Anton Foo√ü as the keynote speaker Johanniskreuz is part of the Roman Catholic parish of Trippstadt. In 1908, after the theology graduate, Anton Foo√ü, had taken over the benefice there in 1906, he initiated the first Speyer Diocesan Catholic Convention (Speyerer Di√∂zesan-Katholikentag) in Johanniskreuz. This Catholic Convention was a firm tradition in the Diocese of Speyer and took place annually at the venue selected by Foo√ü in Johanniskreuz until 2007. Many well known bishops, churchmen, politicians and otherwise notable Roman Catholics since 1908 went to the annual convention in Johanniskreuz as guests, celebrants, preachers or speakers. On 19 July 1931, Anton Foo√ü, now living in W√ºrzburg as an initiator, joined the event again as its keynote speaker. He gave a speech on the 40th anniversary of the death of Ludwig Windthorst entitled \\"Windthorst and Our Time\\". It was to be the last of these conventions before the Second World War. In 1932 it was cancelled because on the same day Reich Chancellor Heinrich Br√ºning was speaking at a major event of the Centre Party in Ludwigshafen. From 1933, during the Nazi era, these diocesan conventions could no longer take place. Only after the Second World War was the tradition revived. In 2007 it came to light that most of the old deciduous and pine trees at the woodland venue were in danger of falling. Because no funding is available to carry our safety work, the Roman Catholic Convention is no longer held in Johanniskreuz.  Economy and infrastructure = Transport = Summertime biker's gathering in Johanniskreuz Johanniskreuz has always been a central communication hub in the Palatine Forest. Whilst the most important historic link from Speyer to Metz ran from east to west and the area around Johanniskreuz was also part of the northern route of the Palatine St. James' Ways, today the main transport axis is the B 48 federal highway from Annweiler to Hochspeyer which runs from north to south. From the Queich valley to Hochspeyer, Johanniskreuz is the only settlement on this very route, which is very winding especially in the north. Also important from a transport perspective is the equally winding state road through the Elmstein Valley towards Neustadt an der Weinstra√üe. Other road links in a western direction through the Karlstal to Trippstadt and southwest ‚Äì Heltersberg, Waldfischbach- Burgalben ‚Äì in places follow paths that were used in the Middle Ages. As the hub of several scenic routes Johanniskreuz has become a meeting place for motorcyclists. However, the road through the Elmsteiner Tal is closed to motorcycles at weekends during the summer months due to the high number of accidents. The nearest railway stations are Schopp on the Bieberm√ºhl Railway and Elmstein on the Cuckoo Railway (Kuckucksb√§hnel). = Tourism = The House of Sustainability Since the first attempts at developing tourism in the Palatine Forest in the 19th century, Johanniskreuz has been a top destination for visitors to the region. Spa houses (Kurh√§user) were established early on that, today, function as hotels. In 2004 the House of Sustainability (Haus der Nachhaltigkeit) opened, with permanent exhibitions about sustainable economics and future energy concepts as its main attraction. The latest tourist facility is the Palatine Forest Mountain Bike Park (Mountainbikepark Pf√§lzerwald), for which 5 routes, together over 300 kilometres long, have been marked out. Johanniskreuz is also the intersection of all footpaths marked with a cross by the Palatine Forest Club.

All volumes reproduced in monochrome on high quality glossy paper a selection of about 100 limited edition prints published during the preceding year. The series provides an important record of the work of artists in the last years of the etching revival and during the collapse of the market for prints. History The first volume of Fine Prints of the Year was published in London in 1924 by Halton and Truscott Smith as a review of the prints issued during the year up to October, 1923.Salaman, M.C., editor (1924). Fine Prints of the Year 1923. An annual review of Contemporary Etching and Engraving, Volume 1. London: Halton & Truscott Smith Limited The volume reproduced 150 etchings, drypoints, lithographs or woodcuts by major British and American printmakers of the day such as Stanley Anderson, Frank Benson, Edmund Blampied, Frank Brangwyn, Gerald Brockhurst, F.L. Griggs, Childe Hassam, James McBey, Henry Rushbury, Frank Short and William Walcot as well as the work of many artists whose work is less well known. Some copies of volume two, for the year 1924, contained as a frontispiece an unsigned, original etching by Frank Brangwyn.Salaman, M.C., editor (1925). Fine Prints of the Year 1924. An annual review of Contemporary Etching and Engraving, Volume 2. London: Halton & Truscott Smith Limited From the third volume Fine Prints of the Year was also published in the USA by Minton, Balch and Company of New York.Salaman, M.C., editor (1926). Fine Prints of the Year 1925. An annual review of Contemporary Etching and Engraving, Volume 3. London: Halton & Truscott Smith Limited; New York: Minton, Balch & Company The first 13 volumes, from 1923 to 1935, contained an introductory essay by Malcolm Salaman, an art critic and Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers, now the Royal Society of Painter-Printmakers. From 1936 to 1938 the introduction was provided by Campbell Dodgson, who was Keeper of Prints and Drawings at the British Museum. From 1926 to 1930 each volume contained a short introduction to American prints by Helen Fagg; from 1931 to 1934 the introduction was written by Susan A. Hutchinson. From the second volume, published in 1924, the series also published a directory of the publishers of prints and a directory of the name and address of the etchers, engravers and lithographers then working in Great Britain, France, the United States of America and elsewhere with the titles, dimensions, publishers and sometimes with the prices of the prints designed or released by each artist during the previous year. This constitutes an important record of the work of many artists which, until the print boom ended in around 1930, were seen as an investment and were the subject of substantial trading and inflated prices. For example, an etching entitled Mersea, Sunset by James McBey, whose work was highly sought after in the 1920s, was issued to subscribers in an edition of 76 artist's proofs in 1926 at a price of 10 guineas. A proof of this print from the edition of 76 was sold at auction at Sotheby's in December of the same year for just under 105 guineas, a ten times higher price.Wilder, F.L. & Wilder, E.L. (1928). Print Prices Current, volume 9, October 1926-August 1927. London: F.L. & E.L. Wilder. The Wall Street Crash in the USA and the worldwide Great Depression greatly diminished the market for prints, but many artists continued to design plates, though fewer in number, in smaller editions and at lower prices, as the volumes of Fine Prints of the Year between 1930 and 1938 show. For example, the artist Edmund Blampied issued 76 etchings between 1920 and 1929, typically in editions of 100 proofs, but in the following decade only published 23 etchings, some in editions of less than 50 proofs.Hall, A. (2010). Edmund Blampied. An illustrated life. Pp 272. Jersey: Jersey Heritage. Fine Prints of the Year continued as a record of the work of etchers and engravers until the sixteenth and last annual volume for 1938,Dodgson, C., editor (1938). Fine Prints of the Year 1938. An annual review of Contemporary Etching and Engraving, Volume 16. London: Halton & Truscott Smith Limited; New York: Minton, Balch & Company just before the start of the Second World War in Europe brought about rationing of paper and presumably put an end to the series. The 16 volumes published in the series reproduced over 1,700 prints and remains an important visual and factual record of the work of etchers and engravers, many of whom were once well known and whose prints commanded high prices.

The introduction of cattle ranching and the beef industry in the southern African landscape is featured prominently within the film as a primary source of devastation to the land. The film is severely critical of the policies of the World Bank and other international banks in advocating and funding African industrial agricultural and cattle breeding projects in an attempt to boost African economies. It portrays graphically the otherwise forbidden pesticides used to try to eradicate the tsetse fly, which he describes as the last bastion of defence the wilderness has against the encroachment of civilisation, and the erosion and overgrazing that results. Some of it is filmed from a microlight aircraft which he used to approach these areas. Numerous interviews with persons engaged in conservation, big- game hunting, hunger relief and agriculture are presented as well as some economically and environmentally sustainable alternatives such as wildlife farming. The documentary was written and directed by Rick Lomba, produced by Rick Lomba Productions and narrated by American actor Jeff Folger. It was funded by the First National Bank and appeared on television for about three years, after which it inexplicably disappeared from circulation.

It is adjacent to Villa Cyrnos. The gardens, laid out in 1909, slope steeply down to the sea. Designs for the gardens, as well as the villa interiors, were provided by Italian painter Raffaele Mainella, who did likewise for Villa Torre Clementina, also in Roquebrune-Cap-Martin.

Physically, the museum is located on the campus of Wageningen University and Research Centre in Wageningen, The Netherlands. The WSM (originally known as International Soil Museum) was created in 1996 at the request of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the International Society of Soil Science (ISSS) (now IUSS). with a view to underpin the development of the FAO-UNESCO 'Soil Map of the World' FAO soil classification. The initial ISM building was located at the University of Utrecht. Some 80 soil monoliths are on display in the WSM, with a much larger collection (some 1000 from over 70 countries) stored and maintained in the repository. For each soil monolith, there is supplemental information about the site of sampling (e.g. landscape, land use, parent material and climate), a detailed profile description for each soil horizon or layer, and data on chemical compositions and physical features. The museum displays examples of the main (32) WRB Soil Reference Groups of the World. A special section is devoted to the major soil types of Netherlands. Further, it showcases soils that have changed significantly under the influence of long-term human activity. Much of this information can also be viewed online .

It grows in coastal and inland forests up to 1500m, from the vicinity of Mossel Bay in the Southern Cape to southern Mozambique - the forms growing on coastal dunes in the northern part of its range are salt tolerant and form low thickets on the margins of woodland. In the southern and eastern Cape forests the species becomes a strangler or liane, while when found on rocky outcrops and cliffs it usually develops into a rock-splitter.http://www.nhm.ac.uk/resources/research- curation/projects/chalcidoids/pdf_X/ComptoNe990.pdf In its epiphytic form this species starts its life in the forks of tree branches, where an accumulation of organic debris aids germination and initial development. It sends down long, thin roots to reach soil and water below. The roots thicken and grow in number with the passage of time, and can eventually enclose the supporting tree, strangling and killing it, leaving the fig to stand alone with no competition for resources. Growing without support the stems may reach 1m in diameter, and up to 20m in height, with a dense canopy and making an excellent shade tree. Bark is thin, smooth, grey and fibrous, and is much used by indigenous tribes as rough cordage. Branchlets are covered with minute, soft, erect hairs. Its tolerance of drought conditions makes it a favourite species among Bonsai growers. Fruits are important as both food and in traditional medicine, and contain laxative substances, flavonoids, sugars, vitamins A and C, acids and enzymes. The latex is an allergen and serious eye irritant. There are some 900 species of figs worldwide,http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/search?q=Ficus each employing the same remarkable manner of pollination where, with rare exceptions, each species of fig relying on one particular species of fig wasp from the family Agaonidae to carry out the fertilisation. F. burtt-davyi is no exception to the rule and depends on the minute Chalcid wasp Elisabethiella baijnathi Wiebes. to effect this. Pollinator-specific volatile attractants are released through the ostioles of ripe figs and in the case of F. burtt-davyi attract only adult female Elisabethiella baijnathi. Fig trees are keystone species in many tropical and subtropical ecosystems.

The first Swan sailing yacht ever produced by the firm, it was designed to serve recreationally but also compete in the One Ton Cup. Production continued until 1971, with a total of 90 Swan 36 boats being built. The 36 was designed by Sparkman & Stephens who were the number one designers in the world at the time and also the designers of the first 775 Swan yachts built by Nautor. Design Its main dimensions are length overall LOA 10,9 m, Length of waterline LWL 7,77 Beam 2,95 m, and displacement of 7000 kg, of which 3600 kg is ballast. Its racing success is very much based on the designer‚Äôs well timed decision to use a separate fin keel and rudder as opposed to the traditional full keel arrangement (a so called split lateral plane). This reduced the wetted surface area of the hull and thus also the frictional drag, which made the yacht faster, and with the rudder placed further aft also more agile.http://bluewaterboats.org/sparkman- and-stephens-swan-36/. Despite separate fin keel and a rudder had been used before in some of the Sparkman & Stephens' lighter sailboat designs such as the Lightning, this was the first time this arrangement was successfully used in production keelboats. =Development= Swan 36 GBR23806 Finola at the 2013 Swan Europeans in Cowes (GBR) held by the Royal Yacht Squadron Unlike most of the later Swan models, the 36 wasn‚Äôt designed solely for Nautor as it had already been introduced before as a wooden constructed full keel Gaia Class version bearing the same S&S; design number 1710. Both of the 1710 designs have the same lines plan but the developed version which was to become Swan 36 had two major improvements; the fin keel and the GRP hull structure which were both completely new features in keelboat design and thus offered major advantage over competition. The design #1710 is based on S&S; design #1478 Hestia which also has an identical lines plan but different LOA. Because of these two clear and completely new advantages, the timing became a crucial factor for Nautor as in 1967 the fin keel with a separate rudder was rapidly becoming a standard in race boat designs and the new GRP structure became a tempting alternative for the boat yards all over the world. Nautor used this opportunity very effectively and was able to launch these fin keeled and well- built large GRP hulls well before any of the competitors could react to the situation. This new construction material provided the means for faster manufacturing and lower production costs, but also brought in fair amount of risks as GRP was a relatively unknown material at the time. Advice on the dimensioning was sought in co-operation with Lloyd's Registers √Öke Lindqvist, who was the Lloyd's principal surveyor in Finland at that time. He took an active interest in the development of this new construction material and used to accompany Rod Stephens on his monthly inspection trips to Nautor. The two ran a friendly competition about who could find more design faults or things to improve. The result was that things fairly quickly got right with respect to proper seagoing layouts, scantlings and the right working methods. As far as the credibility of the fin keel structure was concerned, in the same year S&S; had already finished one of their most remarkable racing designs, the 1967 America's Cup winner Intrepid featuring a fin keel and a separate rudder which proved that this new design feature can win races. Together with the S&S; design badge, these technical innovations made Swan 36 an interesting choice for the buyers even before its launch. An example of this rapidly growing interest can be found in October 1967 Yachtsman magazine which describes Swan 36 a \\"fearsome racing machine\\" which is quite remarkable considering her actual breakthrough to the racing success in the 1968 Cowes Week was almost a full year away. It has taken a considerably long time for the yard to produce anything this radical agin but he brand new ClubSwan 50 has again received similar reviews by the experts before it has even been raced yet.http://www.yachtingworld.com/boat-test/video-we-test-nautors-swans- radical-and-classy-new-clubswan-50-92697 Swan 36 is still a very competitive yacht and in ideal conditions it can still win races even against much bigger and newer yachts. Swan 36 was also sold in the US under the name Palmer Johnson: PJ 36. The Swan 36 series is unique in the Swan line, since the builders in the 60s thought it would be crazy to first build a whole boat (the plug for the mould) and then scrap it once the mould was done, so they decided to make the plug in the finest mahogany. This plug was then to become the hull nr 000 and was eventually completed as a real yacht and it is still sailing (in 2020) as the world's only wooden Swan and currently under the name of Catharina II. https://www.classicswan.org/upload/articles_swan/2017_07_25_06_37_00-2017_tarantella_yacht_translation_lars_strom_translation.pdfhttps://www.classicswan.org/upload/articles_swan/2017_07_25_06_35_41-2017_tarantella_yacht.pdf Racing For a short period of time this application made Swan 36 one of the fastest commercially available sailing yachts of its size, and with a skilled crew she became the one to beat in the international sailing regattas. The yacht gained international recognition in 1968 when a Swan 36 called Casse Tete II (Renamed Carte Blanche) skippered by David Johnson scored a result that no one had done before and won all seven starts of that years Cowes Week regatta. Cowes Week was and still is, one of the largest sailing regattas of its kind in the world and winning it created a lot of media attention and publicity to this new 36 foot racing yacht. This racing success was very important for the future of the yard and generated immense positive feedback that was soon converted to increasing sales figures. Cruising However the racing success was not all the boat had to offer as it was also decided that it should be more comfortable and luxurious on the inside than any of the competing makes. For that reason, Nautor had decided to use their own interior designer to complete the management‚Äôs vision of a fast and luxurious racing yacht with an attractive price tag. The result was an unprecedented combination of competitiveness and comfort combined with a superior cost efficiency brought by the new fiberglass construction method and the skilled boatbuilders of Jakobstad. This well marketed combination of speed, quality and affordability enabled the subsequent commercial success for the whole yard and the creation of Swan brand. Nautor introduced its successor Swan 37 in 1970 which also became a very successful racing yacht. =The Interior= According to the original business idea of Pekka Koskenkyl√§, the Swan 36 had to be not only a winner, but its interior also had to be different and more luxurious than any of the earlier and existing S&S; #1710 designs. Because of this and also because of regional marketing reasons a famous Swedish naval architect Olle Enderlein was hired to assist Sparkman & Stephens in designing the interior to Swan 36. The result was something very different with wide open spaces and completely non fiberglass atmosphere. This interior design allowed the sleeping capacity to be increased from six to seven which was one more than its predecessors had to offer. This was achieved by putting a wide convertible U-Shaped settee to the port side of the saloon. With the table in raised position it gave comfortable area for six persons to eat and with the table in lowered position it converted into a large double bed while leaving the aisle free for people to walk back and forth. With the lifting back rest on the settee the mid ships sleeping capacity was raised to three. The interior design also featured an unusually large galley which occupied most of the starboard side of the saloon. This saloon arrangement had its clear advantages while in port but some sailors thought it was not entirely practical while under sail and because of this customer feedback the interior was largely re-designed to the succeeding model Swan 37. In 2019 Nautor introduced a new radical 36 footer designed by Juan Kouyoumdjian.https://yachtracing.life/meet-the-new-swan-36/ ReferencesExternal links  *http://www.nautorswan.com/en/company/heritage/1966-1975 *http://sparkmanstephens.blogspot.fi/2012/04/design-1710-cybele-and- swan-36.html *http://sparkmanstephens.blogspot.fi/2011/02/design-1710-gaia- class.html *http://www.classicswan.org *http://www.sparkmanstephens.info/doc/july2000.pdf *http://www.slideshare.net/SailInFinland/lars-strm-are-older-nautors-swan- yacths-classics Category:Keelboats Category:1960s sailboat type designs Category:Sailboat type designs by Olin Stephens Category:Sailboat type designs by Sparkman and Stephens Category:Sailboat types built by Nautor Swan Category:Sailing yachts ","title":"Swan 36"},{"id":"41554829","text":"Nellie Frances Cressall (n√©e Wilson) (1882-1973) was an East End suffragette and labour activist. Early life Nellie is frequently stated to have been born in Stepney, but was actually born in Kilburn, on 23 November 1882 to carpenter George Wilson and his wife Julia (born Jennings). In 1904 she married George Joseph Cressall in St. Dunstan's Church, Stepney, and by the end of the year the newly-weds were living at 15 Barnes Street, Limehouse. Political career In 1907 Nellie and George became politically active and joined the Independent Labour Party. In 1912 she met Sylvia Pankhurst, an encounter that influenced her to join the suffragist cause. She stated later, > I had been thinking for some time of the unequal rights of men and women. I > could not agree that men should be the sole parent, that a mother could not > even say whether her child should be vaccinated or not ‚Äì or that women > should receive half pay and many other things as well. I thought that here > is something I can dedicate myself to help in some way to put things right. She joined Sylvia Pankhurst, Keir Hardie, Julia Scurr, Millie Lansbury and George Lansbury in establishing the East London Federation of Suffragettes (ELF) ‚Äì an organisation that combined socialism with a demand for women's suffrage. The group also began production of a weekly paper for working-class women called The Women's Dreadnought. It was around this time that Nellie could frequently be heard speaking at meetings at the East India Dock gates next to the entrance to Blackwall Tunnel. In November 1919 Nellie and George were elected to Poplar Council (the Labour Party had won 39 of the 42 council seats). In 1921 she was one of Poplar councillors sent to prison for refusing to follow a court order demanding they implement what they regarded as an unfair form of taxation. She was sent to Holloway prison on 1 September 1921, along with Susan Lawrence, Julia Scurr, Minnie Lansbury and Jennie Mackay. Nellie was six months pregnant at the time, with her future son Samuel, but nevertheless was left for 24 hours alone in her cell. > Among those who had to make special arrangements were George and Nellie > Cressall, both of whom had been committed to prison. The Cressalls had five > sons between the ages of seven and seventeen, and Nellie, who was thirty- > eight, was expecting her sixth. They arranged that the youngest should be > cared for by their grandmother, while two of the boys joined the group of > children taken to Kent. > Nellie Cressall ‚Ä¶ had a particularly gruelling experience. In view of her > condition she was immediately put into a cell in the hospital wing. But she > was then, apparently, forgotten about for twenty-four hours. When others > were let out for exercise, she was ignored and remained locked up. She heard > the persistent sound of screaming, and while she was there a woman in a > nearby cell committed suicide. She later said: > Think of it, you mothers, young girls taken from a life of freedom and > locked up in cells with doors as thick as a pawnbroker‚Äôs safe. Imprisoning a heavily-pregnant councillor was a serious mistake on the behalf of the government; public support for Nellie grew and her incarceration became an embarrassment. Just over two weeks after her imprisonment, she was released on health grounds. Nellie, however, refused to go unless her fellow councillors were also released ‚Äì she was also very suspicious of a document that the authorities asked her to sign, in case it in some way caused her colleagues further problems. In the end, it was LCC Labour group leader, Harry Gosling, who convinced her to leave, on 21 September 1921, close to three weeks after she had been locked up. The Poplar Rates Rebellion was successful with the government and the London County Council backing down. The rest of the imprisoned councillors were released on 12 October 1921. Nellie became the first female Mayor of Poplar in 1943, holding the post for one year. (Her husband George had been Mayor of Poplar from 1931‚Äì1932.) At the 1951 Labour National Conference ‚Äì in the year she became a widow ‚Äì she made a passionate speech about the progress that had been made since the First World War: > Years ago after the First World War many, many people in my constituency sat > in the dark because they had not got a penny to put in the gas. Today what > do I find? People come to me creating about the heavy electricity bills they > have to pay!‚Ä¶ I have young people coming worrying me for houses‚Ä¶. We have > got some houses where six families lived once upon a time‚Ä¶. Whereas in the > old days people would get married, as I did, and be contented in two nice > little rooms, today our young people want a home of their own. Two years later, at the 1953 Labour National Conference, she was equally forthright. > Nellie Cressall, of Poplar, the widow of Labour pioneer George Lansbury‚Äôs > election agent, who roused the audience to prolonged applause and cheering > when she spoke at the annual Labour Party Conference here. Mrs Cressall, who > is 69, has 26 grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. She attacked the > Conservatives and the Housewives League on the cost-of-living cries. Aneurin > Bevan ‚Äì a master of fiery platform speaking ‚Äì said her speech was the finest > heard at the conference. Mrs Cressall ‚Äòdiscovered‚Äô the Prime Minister, when > in 1907 he knocked at her door and asked to see her husband as he wanted to > help the Labour movement. A decade later, Nellie was living with sons Edgar and George at 15 Macquarie Way on the Isle of Dogs, where she spent her remaining years until her death in 1973.

Early life and career He was born and brought up in Llanelli and went to Llanelli Boys' County School. His love of literature and his childhood desire to be a writer was fed by the books read in Llanelli library. Glynne-Jones worked between the ages of 16 and 36 as a steel-foundry moulder at Glanmor Foundry. He would then type his writings in the evening. He was a fluent Welsh speaker, but suffered from a cleft palate and hare lip. He was released from the foundry on medical grounds in 1943. While his wife and son remained initially in Wales, he went to London to pursue an ambition to earn his living as a freelance writer and novelist. His stories for children and adults were broadcast weekly on Children's Hour and regularly on the mid-morning story hour by the BBC.

Otokonoko (Áî∑„ÅÆÂ®ò) is a play on the word Áî∑„ÅÆÂ≠ê, also pronounced otokonoko and meaning \\"boy\\" (male + child), where the kanji for child (Â≠ê) is substituted with daughter/girl (Â®ò). The term otokonoko is used interchangibly with the terms / for a man who dresses as a woman/girl, respectively. The term originated in Japanese manga and Internet culture in the 2000s, but the concept reflects a broad range of earlier traditions and examples of male drag-wearing in Japan, such as onnagata in kabuki theater and in the career of cross-dressing entertainer Akihiro Miwa. Its popularity increased around 2009, with the rise of dedicated maid caf√©s, fashion stores, cosmetic products, and a range of popular media in the otaku culture. It is often combined with the cosplay of female fictional characters by men (crossplay). By extension, otokonoko is also a genre of media and fiction about cross-dressing men, aimed at a male audience. It is part of the spectrum of sh≈çnen entertainment (targeted at young boys) and seinen entertainment (targeted at young men) and often contains erotic or romantic elements. Otokonoko characters have also begun to appear in mainstream Japanese popular entertainment such as manga, anime, and video games.

McGowan has written a large number of peer-reviewed articles, contributed three commissioned book chapters, and has co-edited one book - Speech and Harm: Controversies Over Free Speech. Education and career McGowan received her bachelor's degree at Wellesley College in philosophy and mathematics in 1990, going on to receive a master's (1993) and a doctorate (1996) in philosophy from Princeton University. After receiving her doctorate, McGowan accepted a position as Assistant Professor of Philosophy at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, which she left to accept a position as Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Wellesley College in 1998. McGowan received a promotion to Associate Professor in 2004, and full Professor in 2011. McGowan currently serves as the Luella LaMer Professor of Women's Studies, and also previously served as the Class of 1966 Associate Professor (a chair endowed by Wellesley's class of 1966.) Research areas McGowan specializes in studying the subtle ways that speech can be used to alter normative facts, and how this technique may be involved in the perpetuation of unjust social systems. She argues that conversational contributions enact normative fact in a way that is not, at the surface, visible, and in a way that in fact requires little authority. Her more recent work has generalized this phenomenon to settings that are not entirely conversational, arguing that sexist speech, some pornography, and some types of hate speech are much more harmful than are currently recognized, and that this has significant implications in public and legal debates over the limits of free speech. She's also interested how one defines the liminal areas of speech; burning a flag, though not an obvious act of speech, is considered protected speech, whereas orally agreeing to a contract for murder for hire, though most certainly speech, is universally not protected.

Such ideas gained physical credibility beginning in the 19th century, but the concept of \\"elementary particle\\" underwent some changes in its meaning: notably, modern physics no longer deems elementary particles indestructible. Even elementary particles can decay or collide destructively; they can cease to exist and create (other) particles in result. Increasingly small particles have been discovered and researched: they include molecules, which are constructed of atoms, that in turn consist of subatomic particles, namely atomic nuclei and electrons. Many more types of subatomic particles have been found. Most such particles (but not electrons) were eventually found to be composed of even smaller particles such as quarks. Particle physics studies these smallest particles and their behaviour under high energies, whereas nuclear physics studies atomic nuclei and their (immediate) constituents: protons and neutrons. Early development The idea that all matter is composed of elementary particles dates to at least the 6th century BC. The Jains in ancient India were the earliest to advocate the particular nature of material objects between 9th and 5th century BCE. According to Jain leaders like Parshvanatha and Mahavira, the ajiva (non living part of universe) consists of matter or pudgala, of definite or indefinite shape which is made up tiny uncountable and invisible particles called permanu. Permanu occupies space-point and each permanu has definite colour, smell, taste and texture. Infinite varieties of permanu unite and form pudgala. The philosophical doctrine of atomism and the nature of elementary particles were also studied by ancient Greek philosophers such as Leucippus, Democritus, and Epicurus; ancient Indian philosophers such as Kanada, DignƒÅga, and Dharmakirti; Muslim scientists such as Ibn al-Haytham, Ibn Sina, and Mohammad al-Ghazali; and in early modern Europe by physicists such as Pierre Gassendi, Robert Boyle, and Isaac Newton. The particle theory of light was also proposed by Ibn al-Haytham, Ibn Sina, Gassendi, and Newton. Those early ideas were founded through abstract, philosophical reasoning rather than experimentation and empirical observation and represented only one line of thought among many. In contrast, certain ideas of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (see Monadology) contradict to almost everything known in modern physics. In the 19th century, John Dalton, through his work on stoichiometry, concluded that each chemical element was composed of a single, unique type of particle. Dalton and his contemporaries believed those were the fundamental particles of nature and thus named them atoms, after the Greek word atomos, meaning \\"indivisible\\" or \\"uncut\\". From atoms to nucleons=First subatomic particles= However, near the end of 19th century, physicists discovered that Dalton's atoms are not, in fact, the fundamental particles of nature, but conglomerates of even smaller particles. Electron was discovered between 1879 and 1897 in works of William Crookes, Arthur Schuster, J. J. Thomson, and other physicists; its charge was carefully measured by Robert Andrews Millikan and Harvey Fletcher in their oil drop experiment of 1909. Physicists theorized that negatively charged electrons are constituent part of \\"atoms\\", along with some (yet unknown) positively charged substance, and it was later confirmed. Electron became the first elementary, truly fundamental particle discovered. Studies of the \\"radioactivity\\", that soon revealed the phenomenon of radioactive decay, provided another argument against considering chemical elements as fundamental nature's elements. Despite these discoveries, the term atom stuck to Dalton's (chemical) atoms and now denotes the smallest particle of a chemical element, not something really indivisible. =Researching particles' interaction= Early 20th-century physicists knew only two fundamental forces: electromagnetism and gravitation, where the latter could not explain the structure of atoms. So, it was obvious to assume that unknown positively charged substance attracts electrons by Coulomb force. 192px In 1909 Ernest Rutherford and Thomas Royds demonstrated that an alpha particle combines with two electrons and forms a helium atom. In modern terms, alpha particles are doubly ionized helium (more precisely, ) atoms. Speculation about the structure of atoms was severely constrained by Rutherford's 1907 gold foil experiment, showing that the atom is mainly empty space, with almost all its mass concentrated in a tiny atomic nucleus. =Inside the atom= Cloud chambers played an important role as particle detectors in the early days of subatomic physics. Some particles including positron we even discovered by using this device By 1914, experiments by Ernest Rutherford, Henry Moseley, James Franck and Gustav Hertz had largely established the structure of an atom as a dense nucleus of positive charge surrounded by lower-mass electrons. These discoveries shed a light to the nature of radioactive decay and other forms of transmutation of elements, as well as of elements themselves. It appeared that atomic number is nothing else than (positive) electric charge of the atomic nucleus of a particular atom. Chemical transformations, governed by electromagnetic interactions, do not change nuclei ‚Äì that's why elements are chemically indestructible. But when the nucleus change its charge and/or mass (by emitting or capturing a particle), the atom can become the one of another element. Special relativity explained how the mass defect is related to the energy produced or consumed in reactions. The branch of physics that studies transformations and the structure of nuclei is now called nuclear physics, contrasted to atomic physics that studies the structure and properties of atoms ignoring most nuclear aspects. The development in the nascent quantum physics, such as Bohr model, led to the understanding of chemistry in terms of the arrangement of electrons in the mostly empty volume of atoms. right In 1918, Rutherford confirmed that the hydrogen nucleus was a particle with a positive charge, which he named the proton. By then, Frederick Soddy's researches of radioactive elements, and experiments of J. J. Thomson and F.W. Aston conclusively demonstrated existence of isotopes, whose nuclei have different masses in spite of identical atomic numbers. It prompted Rutherford to conjecture that all nuclei other than hydrogen contain chargeless particles, which he named the neutron. Evidences that atomic nuclei consist of some smaller particles (now called nucleons) grew; it became obvious that, while protons repulse each other electrostatically, nucleons attract each other by some new force (nuclear force). It culminated in proofs of nuclear fission in 1939 by Lise Meitner (based on experiments by Otto Hahn), and nuclear fusion by Hans Bethe in that same year. Those discoveries gave rise to an active industry of generating one atom from another, even rendering possible (although it will probably never be profitable) the transmutation of lead into gold; and, those same discoveries also led to the development of nuclear weapons. Revelations of quantum mechanics Atomic orbitals of Period 2 elements: 1s 2s 2p (3 items). All complete subshells (including 2p) are inherently spherically symmetric, but it is convenient to assign to \\"distinct\\" p-electrons these two-lobed shapes. Further understanding of atomic and nuclear structures became impossible without improving the knowledge about the essence of particles. Experiments and improved theories (such as Erwin Schr√∂dinger's \\"electron waves\\") gradually revealed that there is no fundamental difference between particles and waves. For example, electromagnetic waves were reformulated in terms of particles called photons. It also revealed that physical objects do not change their parameters, such as total energy, position and momentum, as continuous functions of time, as it was thought of in classical physics: see atomic electron transition for example. Another crucial discovery was identical particles or, more generally, quantum particle statistics. It was established that all electrons are identical: although two or more electrons can exist simultaneously that have different parameters, but they do not keep separate, distinguishable histories. This also applies to protons, neutrons, and (with certain differences) to photons as well. It suggested that there is a limited number of sorts of smallest particles in the universe. The spin‚Äìstatistics theorem established that any particle in our spacetime may be either a boson (that means its statistics is Bose‚ÄìEinstein) or a fermion (that means its statistics is Fermi‚ÄìDirac). It was later found that all fundamental bosons transmit forces, like the photon that transmits light. Some of non- fundamental bosons (namely, mesons) also may transmit forces (see below), although non-fundamental ones. Fermions are particles \\"like electrons and nucleons\\" and generally comprise the matter. Note that any subatomic or atomic particle composed of even total number of fermions (such as protons, neutrons, and electrons) is a boson, so a boson is not necessarily a force transmitter and perfectly can be an ordinary material particle. The spin is the quantity that distinguishes bosons and fermions. Practically it appears as an intrinsic angular momentum of a particle, that is unrelated to its motion but is linked with some other features like a magnetic dipole. Theoretically it is explained from different types representations of symmetry groups, namely tensor representations (including vectors and scalars) for bosons with their integer (in ƒß) spins, and spinor representations for fermions with their half-integer spins. Improved understanding of the world of particles prompted physicists to make bold predictions, such as Dirac's positron in 1928 (founded on the Dirac Sea model) and Pauli's neutrino in 1930 (founded on conservation of energy and angular momentum in beta decay). Both were later confirmed. This culminated in the formulation of ideas of a quantum field theory. The first (and the only mathematically complete) of these theories, quantum electrodynamics, allowed to explain thoroughly the structure of atoms, including the Periodic Table and atomic spectra. Ideas of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory were applied to nuclear physics too. For example, Œ± decay was explained as a quantum tunneling through nuclear potential, nucleons' fermionic statistics explained the nucleon pairing, and Hideki Yukawa proposed certain virtual particles (now knows as œÄ-mesons) as an explanation of the nuclear force. Inventory left Modern nuclear physics Development of nuclear models (such as the liquid-drop model and nuclear shell model) made prediction of properties of nuclides possible. No existing model of nucleon‚Äìnucleon interaction can analytically compute something more complex than based on principles of quantum mechanics, though (note that complete computation of electron shells in atoms is also impossible yet). The most developed branch of nuclear physics in 1940s was studies related to nuclear fission due to its military significance. The main focus of fission-related problems is interaction of atomic nuclei with neutrons: a process that occurs in a fission bomb and a nuclear fission reactor. It gradually drifted away from the rest of subatomic physics and virtually became the nuclear engineering. First synthesised transuranium elements were also obtained in this context, through neutron capture and subsequent Œ≤‚àí decay. The elements beyond fermium cannot be produced in this way. To make a nuclide with more than 100 protons per nucleus one has to use an inventory and methods of particle physics (see details below), namely to accelerate and collide atomic nuclei. Production of progressively heavier synthetic elements continued into 21st century as a branch of nuclear physics, but only for scientific purposes. The third important stream in nuclear physics are researches related to nuclear fusion. This is related to thermonuclear weapons (and conceived peaceful thermonuclear energy), as well as to astrophysical researches, such as stellar nucleosynthesis and Big Bang nucleosynthesis. Physics goes to high energies=Strange particles and mysteries of the weak interaction= In the 1950s, with development of particle accelerators and studies of cosmic rays, inelastic scattering experiments on protons (and other atomic nuclei) with energies about hundreds of MeVs became affordable. They created some short-lived resonance \\"particles\\", but also hyperons and K-mesons with unusually long lifetime. The cause of the latter was found in a new quasi- conserved quantity, named strangeness, that is conserved in all circumstances except for the weak interaction. The strangeness of heavy particles and the Œº-lepton were first two signs of what is now known as the second generation of fundamental particles. The weak interaction revealed soon yet another mystery. In 1957 it was found that it does not conserve parity. In other words, the mirror symmetry was disproved as a fundamental symmetry law. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, improvements in particle accelerators and particle detectors led to a bewildering variety of particles found in high-energy experiments. The term elementary particle came to refer to dozens of particles, most of them unstable. It prompted Wolfgang Pauli's remark: \\"Had I foreseen this, I would have gone into botany\\". The entire collection was nicknamed the \\"particle zoo\\". It became evident that some smaller constituents, yet invisible, form mesons and baryons that counted most of then-known particles. =Deeper constituents of matter= Classification of spin- baryons known in 1960s The interaction of these particles by scattering and decay provided a key to new fundamental quantum theories. Murray Gell-Mann and Yuval Ne'eman brought some order to mesons and baryons, the most numerous classes of particles, by classifying them according to certain qualities. It began with what Gell-Mann referred to as the \\"Eightfold Way\\", but proceeding into several different \\"octets\\" and \\"decuplets\\" which could predict new particles, most famously the , which was detected at Brookhaven National Laboratory in 1964, and which gave rise to the quark model of hadron composition. While the quark model at first seemed inadequate to describe strong nuclear forces, allowing the temporary rise of competing theories such as the S-matrix theory, the establishment of quantum chromodynamics in the 1970s finalized a set of fundamental and exchange particles (). It postulated the fundamental strong interaction, experienced by quarks and mediated by gluons. These particles were proposed as a building material for hadrons (see hadronization). This theory is unusual because individual (free) quarks cannot be observed (see color confinement), unlike the situation with composite atoms where electrons and nuclei can be isolated by transferring ionization energy to the atom. Then, the old, broad denotation of the term elementary particle was deprecated and a replacement term subatomic particle covered all the \\"zoo\\", with its hyponym \\"hadron\\" referring to composite particles directly explained by the quark model. The designation of an \\"elementary\\" (or \\"fundamental\\") particle was reserved for leptons, quarks, their antiparticles, and quanta of fundamental interactions (see below) only. =Quarks, leptons, and four fundamental forces= The Standard Model Because the quantum field theory (see above) postulates no difference between particles and interactions, classification of elementary particles allowed also to classify interactions and fields. Now a large number of particles and (non-fundamental) interactions is explained as combinations of a (relatively) small number of fundamental substances, thought to be fundamental interactions (incarnated in fundamental bosons), quarks (including antiparticles), and leptons (including antiparticles). As the theory distinguished several fundamental interactions, it became possible to see which elementary particles participate in which interaction. Namely: right * All particles participate in gravitation. * All charged elementary particles participate in electromagnetic interaction. ** As a consequence, neutron participates in it with its magnetic dipole in spite of zero electric charge. This is because it is composed of charged quarks whose charges sum to zero. * All fermions participate in the weak interaction. * Quarks participate in the strong interaction, along gluons (its own quanta), but not leptons nor any fundamental bosons other than gluons. The next step was a reduction in number of fundamental interactions, envisaged by early 20th century physicists as the \\"united field theory\\". The first successful modern unified theory was the electroweak theory, developed by Abdus Salam, Steven Weinberg and, subsequently, Sheldon Glashow. This development culminated in the completion of the theory called the Standard Model in the 1970s, that included also the strong interaction, thus covering three fundamental forces. After the discovery, made at CERN, of the existence of neutral weak currents, mediated by the Z boson foreseen in the standard model, the physicists Salam, Glashow and Weinberg received the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics for their electroweak theory. The discovery of the weak gauge bosons (quanta of the weak interaction) through the 1980s, and the verification of their properties through the 1990s is considered to be an age of consolidation in particle physics. While accelerators have confirmed most aspects of the Standard Model by detecting expected particle interactions at various collision energies, no theory reconciling general relativity with the Standard Model has yet been found, although supersymmetry and string theory were believed by many theorists to be a promising avenue forward. The Large Hadron Collider, however, which began operating in 2008, has failed to find any evidence whatsoever that is supportive of supersymmetry and string theory, and appears unlikely to do so, meaning \\"the current situation in fundamental theory is one of a serious lack of any new ideas at all.\\" This state of affairs should not be viewed as a crisis in physics, but rather, as David Gross has said, \\"the kind of acceptable scientific confusion that discovery eventually transcends.\\" The fourth fundamental force, gravitation, is not yet integrated into particle physics in a consistent way. =Higgs boson= One possible signature of a Higgs boson from a simulated proton‚Äìproton collision. It decays almost immediately into two jets of hadrons and two electrons, visible as lines. As of 2011, the Higgs boson, the quantum of a field that is thought to provide particles with rest masses, remained the only particle of the Standard Model to be verified. On July 4, 2012, physicists working at CERN's Large Hadron Collider announced that they had discovered a new subatomic particle greatly resembling the Higgs boson, a potential key to an understanding of why elementary particles have masses and indeed to the existence of diversity and life in the universe.https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/05/science/cern- physicists-may-have-discovered-higgs-boson- particle.html?pagewanted=3&_r=1&ref;=science Rolf-Dieter Heuer, the director general of CERN, said that it was too soon to know for sure whether it is an entirely new particle, which weighs in at 125 billion electron volts ‚Äì one of the heaviest subatomic particles yet ‚Äì or, indeed, the elusive particle predicted by the Standard Model, the theory that has ruled physics for the last half-century. It is unknown if this particle is an impostor, a single particle or even the first of many particles yet to be discovered. The latter possibilities are particularly exciting to physicists since they could point the way to new deeper ideas, beyond the Standard Model, about the nature of reality. For now, some physicists are calling it a \\"Higgslike\\" particle. Joe Incandela, of the University of California, Santa Barbara, said, \\"It's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years, going way back to the discovery of quarks, for example.\\" The groups operating the large detectors in the collider said that the likelihood that their signal was a result of a chance fluctuation was less than one chance in 3.5 million, so-called \\"five sigma,\\" which is the gold standard in physics for a discovery. Michael Turner, a cosmologist at the University of Chicago and the chairman of the physics center board, said Confirmation of the Higgs boson or something very much like it would constitute a rendezvous with destiny for a generation of physicists who have believed the boson existed for half a century without ever seeing it. Further, it affirms a grand view of a universe ruled by simple and elegant and symmetrical laws, but in which everything interesting in it being a result of flaws or breaks in that symmetry. According to the Standard Model, the Higgs boson is the only visible and particular manifestation of an invisible force field that permeates space and imbues elementary particles that would otherwise be massless with mass. Without this Higgs field, or something like it, physicists say all the elementary forms of matter would zoom around at the speed of light; there would be neither atoms nor life. The Higgs boson achieved a notoriety rare for abstract physics. To the eternal dismay of his colleagues, Leon Lederman, the former director of Fermilab, called it the \\"God particle\\" in his book of the same name, later quipping that he had wanted to call it \\"the goddamn particle\\". Professor Incandela also stated, Dr. Peter Higgs was one of six physicists, working in three independent groups, who in 1964 invented the notion of the cosmic molasses, or Higgs field. The others were Tom Kibble of Imperial College, London; Carl Hagen of the University of Rochester; Gerald Guralnik of Brown University; and Fran√ßois Englert and Robert Brout, both of Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles. One implication of their theory was that this Higgs field, normally invisible and, of course, odorless, would produce its own quantum particle if hit hard enough, by the right amount of energy. The particle would be fragile and fall apart within a millionth of a second in a dozen different ways depending upon its own mass. Unfortunately, the theory did not say how much this particle should weigh, which is what made it so difficult to find. The particle eluded researchers at a succession of particle accelerators, including the Large Electron‚ÄìPositron Collider at CERN, which closed down in 2000, and the Tevatron at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, or Fermilab, in Batavia, Ill., which shut down in 2011. Further experiments continued and in March 2013 it was tentatively confirmed that the newly discovered particle was a Higgs Boson. Although they have never been seen, Higgslike fields play an important role in theories of the universe and in string theory. Under certain conditions, according to the strange accounting of Einsteinian physics, they can become suffused with energy that exerts an antigravitational force. Such fields have been proposed as the source of an enormous burst of expansion, known as inflation, early in the universe and, possibly, as the secret of the dark energy that now seems to be speeding up the expansion of the universe. =Further theoretical development= Modern theoretical development includes refining of the Standard Model, researching in its foundations such as the Yang‚ÄìMills theory, and researches in computational methods such as the lattice QCD. A long- standing problem is quantum gravitation. No solution that is useful for particle physics has been achieved. =Further experimental development= There are researches about quark‚Äìgluon plasma, a new (hypothetical) state of matter. There are also some recent experimental evidences that tetraquarks, pentaquarks and glueballs exist. The proton decay is not observed (or, generally, non-conservation of the baryon number), but predicted by some theories extending beyond the Standard Model, hence there are searches for it.

The case was also known as L√°zarogate. B√°ez became a friend of Kirchner in 1991, and in 2003 founded a construction company, Austral Construcciones, which was awarded many government contracts during Kirchner's presidency. In 2011 B√°ez built Kirchner's mausoleum. He has been called the main beneficiary of public contracts in Patagonia. Early life and education B√°ez was born in 1951 in San Luis del Palmar, Corrientes, Argentina, to a family of Peronists. His family moved to R√≠o Gallegos, Santa Cruz, in Patagonia, in 1962. The move was reportedly caused by political persecution, his father having apparently had to leave his home province following the coup against President Arturo Frondizi. In 1984 he married Norma Beatriz Calismonte, who worked as tutor assistant in a public secondary school. Career=Bank jobs= After completing high school, in 1980, he began his first job, as an office junior at a local branch of a National Bank. He then served as a sergeant in the army. In 1985, he started working at his second job, as a teller at the provincial state Bank of Santa Cruz. In 1990 he established a relationship with N√©stor Kirchner by means of leaked bank accounts data B√°ez offered to Kirchner. Kirchner was at the time serving his last year as mayor of R√≠o Gallegos and beginning a crucial campaign for governor, a position he would end up holding from 1991 to 2003. B√°ez then became bank assistant manager. =Austral Construcciones= B√°ez formed Austral Construcciones S.A. in 2003, and within three months the firm's capital rose from $AR12,000 to $AR500,000. Former Santa Cruz prosecutor Andr√©s Vivanco said in May 2013 that B√°ez \\"was previously just a bank employee who has no legal way of justifying his increased fortune... Everything L√°zaro B√°ez has come from N√©stor Kirchner. He previously had nothing; he was not an entrepreneur because he never risked his capital, he would always just wait to submit a public tender with the government\\". Beginning in 2005, Austral and other firms owned by B√°ez were awarded the majority of the contracts offered by the province of Santa Cruz during the presidency of N√©stor Kirchner and 12% of the contracts awarded by the Ministry of Planning under Minister Julio de Vido. Over a five-year period, the firm received 4 billion dollars in federal contracts and 1.2 billion dollars in contracts for the province of Santa Cruz. His firm Southern Building was investigated in Liechtenstein for money laundering. Other business activities After 2006, B√°ez began to buy properties along the Santa Cruz River. He ultimately paid more than $28 million for 10 properties totaling 200,000 acres. Later he contracted with Kirchner to construct the C√≥ndor Cliff-La Barrancosa Dams which would flood those lands. One commentator wrote in 2012 that B√°ez had plainly purchased the properties knowing that they would be made valuable by the dam project. \\"In any serious country this would be called the use of privileged information, influence peddling, [and] corruption.\\" According to a 2009 report, B√°ez constructed a luxury building on Kirchner-owned land in Rio Gallegos. The structure was completed in 2007. B√°ez built himself a mansion outside of Rio Gallegos. In recent years he has expanded his interests into the oil business and properties along the Santa Cruz River. B√°ez also owns the oil firms Misahar SA and Epsur SA, and the newspaper Prensa Libre in Rio Gallegos.http://www.perfil.com/politica/Lazaro-Baez-denuncia-a-Faria-y-pide- que-declaren-Rial-Ventura-y-Molinari‚Äî20130516-0007.html He has two sons, Mart√≠n Antonio B√°ez and Leandro Mart√≠n B√°ez. The former, who has his own mansion in Rio Gallegos, is considered B√°ez's likely successor as head of his empire. =2007 tax investigation= On August 17, 2007, the Deputy Director of Research of the General Tax Directorate (DGI), Jaime Mecikovsky, completed an elaborate three-year investigation of public works contractors and concluded that Austral had issued false invoices. Relationship with Kirchner In April 2013, Deputy Francisco De Narv√°ez called B√°ez \\"a person of great intimacy with the Kirchner family.\\" Kirchner reportedly ate his last dinner with B√°ez and with the two men's wives. It was B√°ez, moreover, who built Kirchner's massive mausoleum in the Rio Gallegos Cemetery. In late December 2013 it was reported that the mausoleum had sustained structural damage, owing to its monumental weight, and that B√°ez had visited the site personally to inspect the damage. Jorge Lanata program On April 14, 2013, journalist Jorge Lanata of Periodismo para todos (Journalism for All), a news program aired on Argentina's Channel 13, presented a report entitled \\"La ruta del dinero K\\" (\\"The K Money Trail\\"), with \\"K\\" standing for the late Argentinian president N√©stor Kirchner. Lanata's report included a videotaped testimony by financier Federico Elaskar and a hidden-camera recording of businessman Leonardo Fari√±a in which these men described large-scale illegal financial manipulations by members of the Kirchner circle, including B√°ez, that involved the transfer of about 55 million euros over a six-month period to Switzerland and other foreign tax havens. The men indicated that Kirchner himself was directly involved in these maneuvers. Allegedly, at B√°ez's direction, Fari√±a orchestrated a plan whereby the funds were sent abroad via Elaskar's financial firm, SGI. More than fifty companies were purportedly created with the express purpose of facilitating these transfers. Also supposedly involved in this scheme was Fabi√°n Rossi, who was said to have funneled the money through Panama banks. According to Elaskar, silver from Patagonia was shipped to Switzerland by way of Montevideo, Uruguay. Asked on hidden camera whether B√°ez was an associate of Kirchner's, Fari√±a said yes, and added that \\"in politics there are no front men, only operators.\\" Elaskar said that he had been cheated and threatened with death by business associates of B√°ez. Elaskar also said that both of B√°ez's sons had been involved in the offshore firms to which funds had been illegally transferred. Martin B√°ez runs Teegan, a firm founded in Panama and based in the tax haven of Belize. Later interviews In a subsequent interview with Rolando Gra√±a on Am√©rica Noticias, however, Elaskar claimed that there had been no money laundering or death threats, and that everything he had said on Lanata's program was untrue. \\"I lied. I apologize,\\" he said. He maintained that he had lied because he was \\"angry\\" and \\"young\\" Fari√±a, in an interview with Jorge Rial of Intrusos (Intruders), also claimed to have been lying in the videotape aired on Lanata's program. Fari√±a said that he apologized to B√°ez, whom he called \\"a first-rate guy.\\" Lanata replied to these claims by saying that Fari√±a was \\"not the brain\\" of the operation and that on his next show he would provide evidence B√°ez was the real mastermind. In an early May interview with Lanata, Kirchner's former secretary, M√≠riam Quiroga, confirmed some of the charges made by Fari√±a and Elaskar about B√°ez, saying that at the Casa Rosada, during Kirchner's presidency, she had seen bags, apparently containing money, that were sent to the Kirchners' mansion in Santa Cruz province, where they were placed in a vault, the money later presumably finding its way to bank accounts in Switzerland, Panama, and Belize. Legal case After the Lanata program was aired, several opposition legislators called on public prosecutor Carlos Gonella to investigate the accusations against B√°ez. They also called for the freezing of B√°ez's assets. A judicial investigation of B√°ez on charges of money laundering, conspiracy, and cover-up was initiated on April 17. Mart√≠n Irurzun of the Federal Court appointed Sebasti√°n Casanello as the judge in the case. On the same date, and again in early May, raids were carried out on SGI's offices at \\"La Rosadita\\" by la Polic√≠a de Seguridad Aeroportuaria (Airport Security Police, PSA) on the orders of Casanello. In early June, B√°ez's possessions and safety boxes were raided by the National Gendarmerie, also on Casanello's orders. B√°ez was described as being \\"visibly upset\\" by the raids, which he described as \\"unnecessary show.\\" Other persons charged in the case included Elaskar, Fari√±a, Rossi, B√°ez's son Leandro Mart√≠n B√°ez, and Daniel Perez Gadin. On May 3, after Elaskar and Fari√±a had already been charged, federal prosecutor William Marijuan filed money laundering charges against B√°ez. It was reported in early May that B√°ez had made some of the suspicious land purchases through three of his companies: Austral Construcciones, Austral Agro, and Valle Hermoso. Judge Casanello called L√°razo B√°ez for inquiry in 2016. He took a plane with unknown destination, so the judge ordered his detention, fearing an attempt to escape. =B√°ez lawsuits against Elaskar and Farina= It was reported on May 5 that B√°ez was suing Elaskar and Fari√±a for the statements they had made about him on Lanata's program. B√°ez called the accusations part of \\"a smear campaign...with a clear political agenda.\\" On May 22, B√°ez said that he had never worked with Fari√±a, and that Fari√±a had, rather, worked for the firm Pluscarga, which did business with B√°ez's businesses. He also denied any involvement in money laundering or any business relationship with Kirchner. B√°ez's lawsuit against Fari√±a and his wife, Karina Jelinek, on charges of slander was dismissed in early July by judge Ra√∫l Garc√≠a. =Further revelations= In December 2013, the argentinian newspaper La Nacion reported that seven B√°ez companies had signed documents agreeing to rent 935 rooms a month at the Alto Calafate Hotel throughout 2010 and 2011, whether or not they were occupied. regardless of whether in fact employees were staying there. La Nacion additionally revealed that B√°ez had paid at least $3.2 million to Kirchner in \\"rent\\" for Las Dunas, an inn in El Calafate, and that he had paid a total of $14.5 million in \\"rent\\" for the two hotels, plus the La Aldea Hotel, during 2010 and 2011, even as B√°ez was receiving large sums from the federal government for public works projects. It also emerged in December 2013 that B√°ez, during the previous ten years, in Santa Cruz alone, had purchased tracts of land amounting to at least 263,000 hectares, or 13 times the size of the Federal District. =Injunction request= Also in December 2013, B√°ez asked for an injunction that would prohibit the media from publishing anything about his business or personal ties to Kirchner. This request was rejected by El Foro de Periodismo Argentino (Argentine Journalism Forum, FOPEA) and the Asociaci√≥n de Entidades Period√≠sticas Argentinas (Association of Argentine Journalism Entities, ADEPA), the latter of which called the idea unconstitutional. Reacting to B√°ez's request, Parliament member Margarita Stolbizer described him as a \\"mobster\\" while Labor Party leader Gabriel Solano described the use of \\"prior censorship to defend the 'confidentiality' of the business activities of L√°zaro B√°ez\\" as undemocratic. =December 2013 raid= On the orders of tax court judge Javier L√≥pez Biscayart, who was investigating B√°ez on charges of tax evasion and money laundering, the Argentinian federal police raided the offices of Austral Construcciones in Buenos Aires in late December 2013. =Security measures= In January 2014, it was reported that B√°ez traveled with such a level of security that it was \\"as if he were the President of the United States in a war zone.\\" =Swiss investigation= It was reported in August 2013 that the investigation of B√°ez's financial dealings in Switzerland was stalled because that country's Department of Justice was refusing to release information about Swiss bank accounts held in the name of one of B√°ez's sons. The Swiss ambassador to Argentina, Johannes Matyassy, said in January 2014 that a criminal investigation into B√°ez's financial activities in Switzerland was progressing. Matyassy said that this was the first case in which Switzerland and Argentina had collaborated in such a manner under a new cooperative agreement. =Uruguayan investigation= It was reported in late January 2014 that a Uruguayan investigation into the money laundering charges against B√°ez had not progressed, owing to the failure of Argentinian authorities to cooperate with the investigation.

It was discovered unexpectedly in 2000 by Charles Steidel and colleagues, who were surveying for high-redshift galaxies using the 200 inch (5.08 m) Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory. The researchers had been investigating the abundance of galaxies in the young Universe when they came across two objects which would become known as Lyman-alpha blobs‚Äîhuge concentrations of gases emitting the Lyman- alpha emission line of hydrogen. LAB-1 is the first discovered Lyman-alpha blob, hence it has the number 1. It is the prototype of objects of this kind. It is also one of the largest of its kind, measuring 300,000 light years across, three times larger than the Milky Way. The blob appears green on the image because of the combination of the high redshift (z = 3) and the ultraviolet nature of the blob. Imaging with the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope showed that much of the light from the blob is polarized, the proportion increasing and peaking at around 20% at a radius of 45 kiloparsecs (145,000 light-years), forming a huge ring around the blob. It is still unclear as to why this object is emitting the Lyman-alpha emission radiation. It is thought that the light is coming from galaxies within the central region of the blob. Light of such intensities could be from active galaxies or supermassive black holes actively absorbing matter. An alternate theory is that the light is from cooling gas falling into early galaxies, which has possibly come from cosmic filaments (as galaxies are thought to form at the intersections of these filaments), however the pattern of polarisation found argues against this.

Mufarrij was engaged in repeated rebellions against the Fatimid Caliphate, which controlled southern Syria at the time. Although he was several times defeated and forced into exile, by the 990s Mufarrij managed to establish himself and his tribe as the de facto autonomous masters of much of Palestine around Ramlah (the district of Jund Filastin) with Fatimid acquiescence. In 1011, another rebellion against Fatimid authority was more successful, and a short-lived Jarrahid-led Bedouin state was established in Palestine centred at Ramlah. The Bedouin even proclaimed a rival Caliph to the Fatimid al-Hakim, in the person of the Alid Abu'l-Futuh al-Hasan ibn Ja'far. Bedouin independence survived until 1013, when the Fatimids launched their counterattack. Their will to resist weakened by Fatimid bribes, the Bedouin were quickly defeated. At the same time Mufarrij died, possibly poisoned, and his sons quickly came to terms with the Fatimids. Among them, Hassan ibn Mufarrij al-Jarrah managed to succeed to his father's position, and became a major player in the politics of the region over the next decades.  Early life and career  Map of Early Islamic Syria and its provinces in the 9th‚Äì10th centuries Mufarrij was the son of Daghfal ibn al-Jarrah, a member of the Banu Tayy who was the first of the Jarrahid family to rise to prominence, as an ally of the Qarmatians in their wars with the Fatimids in the early 970s. During this time, the Jarrahids emerged to lead the Banu Tayy opposition to the first attempts by the Fatimids, who had just captured Egypt, to impose their control over Palestine. Mufarrij first appears in the aftermath of the Battle of Ramlah in 977, where the Turkish ruler of Damascus, Alptekin, was defeated by the forces of the Fatimid caliph al-Aziz. Alptekin fled the field and almost died of thirst in the desert, until he was found by Mufarrij, who had in earlier times befriended him. Mufarrij rescued Alptekin and brought him to his home, but while his guest rested, he went to al-Aziz and betrayed Alptakin in exchange for the 100,000 gold dinars the Caliph had promised as a reward for his capture. Mufarrij next appears in 979, when the Hamdanid emir Abu Taghlib arrived in Palestine fleeing from the Buyid conquest of his domains in the Jazira, and became embroiled in the complex power struggles between the Fatimid government and local elites. Abu Taghlib with his followers established himself in Jawlan and endeavoured to gain recognition by the Fatimids as governor of Damascus, but the rebel general al-Qassam, who held the city, repulsed him. Under attack by the Damascenes, and with members of his family starting to desert him, Abu Taghlib moved further south to the region of Lake Tiberias. Hoping to sow disunion among the Arab tribes and weaken their power to the benefit of the Fatimids, the local Fatimid general al-Fadl ibn Salih promised Ramlah to Abu Taghlib, even though he himself had previously handed Mufarrij a document from al-Aziz that gave the city to the Jarrahids. When Abu Taghlib, joined by Mufarrij's rivals, the Banu Uqayl, attacked Ramlah, Mufarrij called upon al-Fadl for aid. Al-Fadl agreed, and in the ensuing battle on 29 August Abu Taghlib was defeated and taken captive by Mufarrij. After parading him through Ramlah tied to a camel, Mufarrij killed his prisoner with his own hands to prevent him from being used by the Fatimids against him in the future. This episode cemented Mufarrij's control over Ramlah and marked his and his tribe's rise to a powerful position in local affairs. With their rivals defeated, the Tayy now became \\"the major bedouin power in the area\\", according to Hugh Kennedy, and a continuing nuisance to the Fatimids, since although they recognized Fatimid authority, in practice Mufarrij and his followers acted as independent agents.  Rebellions against the Fatimids and exile  The accord between Mufarrij and al-Fadl soon ended, and the Fatimid general turned against the Jarrahids, but through diplomatic means Mufarrij succeeded in getting al-Aziz to order his general to cease the attacks on him. Nevertheless, Mufarrij and his men followed this up with destructive raids across Palestine in 980. On 7 July 981, while the Fatimid army was engaged in besieging Qassam in Damascus, Mufarrij openly rebelled against the Fatimids, and was joined by Bishara, the governor of Tiberias, who joined the bedouin along with many of his men, mostly former Hamdanid soldiers. The Fatimids responded by dispatching another army, headed by Rashiq al-Azizi, which quickly routed the Jarrahids. The latter fled south into the Hejaz, where they attacked a caravan of Hajj pilgrims returning from Mecca in June 982, before in turn destroying a pursuing Fatimid army under Muflih al- Wahbani at Ayla. After this success Mufarrij and his men returned to Palestine where they confronted Rashiq, but were again defeated and forced to flee across the desert to Homs, where Bakjur, the local governor on behalf of the Hamdanid emir of Aleppo, Sa'd al-Dawla, took them in and catered for them, probably in winter 982. Despite this hospitality, the Tayy now went north and sought to enter the service of the Byzantine Empire. Emperor Basil II accepted their request, and a few months later, in autumn 983, the Tayy fought alongside the Byzantines under the doux of Antioch, Bardas Phokas, when he went to relieve Aleppo from an attack by Bakjur, who had rebelled against Sa'd al-Dawla. Soon afterwards, Mufarrij apparently obtained a pardon (aman) for himself and his followers from al-Aziz, although when he returned to the Fatimid domains in late 983 or early 984 he allied himself with Bakjur, who was now the Fatimid governor of Damascus, against the Fatimid vizier Ibn Killis. In the end, in 988 Ibn Killis prevailed upon al-Aziz to oust Bakjur, and an army was sent against the allies. The Fatimid commander, Munis, took Ramlah, but the Jarrahids withdrew north towards Damascus. Munis recruited the other Arab tribes, rivals of the Tayy, in his ranks, and in a battle at Dariya, near Damascus, his forces defeated the troops of Bakjur and Mufarrij. This forced Bakjur to relinquish his post on 29 October and retreat with his followers north to Raqqa on the Euphrates. Mufarrij and his men followed Bakjur, and in 989 are recorded as attacking yet another Hajj caravan in north Arabia.  Return to Palestine  It was only after the death of Ibn Killis in 991, that Mufarrij was able to return to Palestine. Ibn Killis had remained implacably opposed to Mufarrij, whom he regarded a dangerous individual: even on his deathbed, the vizier had urged al-Aziz to have Mufarrij executed should he fall into Fatimid hands, but in the event, the Caliph gave the Jarrahid a full pardon. In 992 al-Aziz invited Mufarrij to participate in the campaign against Aleppo under the Turkish general Manjutakin, but it is unclear whether Mufarrij fought in this or the subsequent campaigns, as he is not mentioned again until 996. Al-Aziz died in October 996 and was succeeded by his under- age son, al-Hakim, whereupon a fierce factional struggle erupted between the Turkish troops, led by Manjutakin, on the one hand, and the Kutama Berbers, who under al-Hasan ibn 'Ammar moved to seize control of the caliphal government. Mufarrij sided with Manjutakin and fought alongside him in the battle outside Ascalon, but the Berber general Sulayman ibn Ja'far ibn Fallah was victorious. Mufarrij, however, managed once more to emerge unscathed. As the orientalist Marius Canard writes, \\"following his usual tactics\\", he \\"did not hesitate to desert [Manjutakin] and to cross over to Sulayman's camp\\", and it was his son Ali who pursued and took Manjutakin prisoner. In 997, Mufarrij tried to capture Ramlah and devastated the surrounding lands, but was attacked by the new governor of Damascus, Jaysh ibn Samsama, and forced to once again flee to the lands of his fellow Tayy in the mountains of northern Hejaz. There, Canard says, \\"on the point of being captured he took part in a little comedy, sending the old women of his tribe to ask for aman and pardon, which were granted\\". In 1005/6, Mufarrij sent his sons Ali, Hassan and Mahmud to lead a Bedouin army to assist the Fatimid army sent to quell the rebellion of Abu Rikwa. In the next year, however, he is again found holding up one of the pilgrim caravans from Baghdad while it was crossing Tayy territory, and forcing them to pay tribute to him.  Renewed uprising and autonomous rule  Portrait of Caliph al-Hakim In 1011, Abu'l-Qasim al-Husayn, son of the executed Abu'l-Hasan Ali ibn al-Husayn al-Maghribi, fled to Palestine, where he sought refuge in Hassan ibn Mufarrij's camp. In response, al-Hakim charged the Turk Yarukh with assembling an army to bring Abu'l-Qasim and his Jarrahid protectors to heel. Mufarrij's two other sons, Mahmud and Ali, were in Egypt at the time, and, having learned of the Caliph's preparations, rushed to their father to warn him. Together, Abu'l-Qasim and the younger Jarrahids convinced Mufarrij of the danger represented by Yarukh and the need to confront him before he reached Ramlah. Consequently, the Jarrahids prepared to attack the Fatimid army at Gaza. Yarukh was informed of this, and planned to catch the ambushers by surprise by having 1,000 cavalry from the Ramlah garrison strike them in the rear along with his own troops. In the event, however, the messenger he sent to Ramlah to inform the garrison was captured by the Jarrahids, and Hassan managed to ambush Yarukh and capture him and his family near Rafiah. Upon Abu'l-Qasim's suggestion, the Jarrahids now raised all the tribesmen of the Jund Filastin to open revolt and recruited them for an attack on Ramlah, the provincial capital. Ramlah fell and was pillaged by the Bedouin, who had been offered \\"a general licence to despoil and plunder\\" (M. Gil). Learning of these events, al-Hakim wrote to Mufarrij and reproached him, demanding the safe return of Yarukh to Egypt, while at the same time offering the sum of 50,000 dinars if the Jarrahids would again submit. Abu'l-Qasim, who feared that Mufarrij was inclined to accept, persuaded Hassan to have Yarukh executed. The Jarrahids followed this open act of rebellion by recognizing an anti-caliph in the person of the Alid Sharif of Mecca, Abu'l-Futuh al-Hasan ibn Ja'far, in July 1012. Abu'l-Qasim himself journeyed to Mecca, where he persuaded Abu'l-Futuh to accept the role. The latter, assuming the title of al-Rashid bi'llah (\\"Righteous with God\\"), succeeded in winning the recognition of the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, and went to Ramlah. On his arrival there in September, he was greeted with jubilation by the Bedouin, and the local preacher read the Friday prayer in his name. Mufarrij also tried to win support among the Christians, and possibly curry the favour of the Byzantine Empire as well, by sponsoring works to restore the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, which had only recently been demolished on the orders of al-Hakim, and by arranging the re-appointment of a Patriarch to the vacant see. In general, the Jarrahids seem to have had close relations with the Christians and maintained contact with Byzantium, a fact which would play a role in later events. This period marked the apogee of the Bedouin power in Palestine: as the contemporary historian Yahya of Antioch writes, the entire interior of the land, \\"from al-Farama to Tiberias\\", was under their control, with only the coastal cities resisting the siege attempts, and coins were minted in Abu'l-Futuh's name. Although in the end short-lived, this period of Bedouin domination had a considerable negative impact on the region. Kennedy remarks that \\"it was marked by the destruction and desolation of many of the settled communities, and as elsewhere in the Fertile Crescent at this period, the extension of nomad-controlled area at the expense of the urban and agricultural areas.\\" Despite its apparent success, Bedouin power was fragile, as the Jarrahids proved susceptible to bribery. Al-Hakim sent large sums and gifts to Mufarrij and his sons, with Hassan in return sending back the grandsons of Jawhar al-Siqilli, who had been entrusted to his care, to be executed. Abu'l-Futuh began to have second thoughts, as the Jarrahids increasingly treated him disrespectfully after the money he had brought with him ran out. Eventually he returned to Mecca and Fatimid allegiance. Abu'l-Qasim too feared a Jarrahid rapprochement with the Fatimids, and fled for Iraq, eventually rising to become a vizier for the Marwanid and Uqaylid rulers of the Jazira. Finally, in July/August 1013, al-Hakim sent a 24,000-strong army under Ali ibn Ja'far ibn Fallah against the Bedouin. The latter were heavily defeated in the field and lost Ramlah. Ali and Mahmud surrendered, and at the same time, Mufarrij died, possibly poisoned by agents of the Caliph. Thereupon Hassan too secured a pardon, and managed to retain his father's lands in Palestine. Although initially loyal to the Fatimids, he too held ambitions to rule Palestine as an autonomous ruler. From 1024, he launched a series of rebellions, allied with the Christians of Palestine and the Byzantines. Like his father, however, he failed to achieve but ephemeral success.

Biography Born in Kenosha, Wisconsin, to Anna (Schuenemann) and John Maurer, Sr. He graduated from Kenosha High School (Now Mary D. Bradford High School) in 1940. He joined the United States Army Air Forces in 1942 for service in World War II. He was a B-24 pilot in the European theater and served with distinction. After the war, he attended Marquette University and was a commercial airline pilot for Capital Airlines and United Airlines. He retired as a DC-10 Captain from United Airlines. He was a member of the Air Line Pilots Association, International, and the Air Force Association. Political career Maurer's career in politics began with his term as a member of the Pleasant Prairie Board of Supervisors, from 1961 to 1963. In 1969, Maurer was elected chairman of the Town Board, and would remain in that position until 1975. Maurer ran for the Wisconsin Senate for the first time in 1972, but lost in the Democratic Primary to Doug La Follette. La Follette would go on to win the general election, but resigned two years later after he was elected Wisconsin Secretary of State in the 1974 election. Maurer decided to run again in the April 1975 special election to finish La Follette's term. Maurer would go on to win the election and would be re-elected in 1976 and 1980. His colleagues elected him Majority Caucus Chairman from 1981 through the end of his senate term. Maurer ran for the newly-created role of Kenosha County Executive in 1982, but was defeated by Gilbert Dosemagen. He chose not to seek re-election in 1984, but in 1985 he was appointed to be Secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs by Wisconsin Governor Tony Earl. Earl lost re- election in 1986, but his successor, Tommy Thompson, chose not to replace Maurer.

Her work focuses on bringing 20th century phenomenology and French philosophy into dialogue with critical race and feminist theories. Al-Saji believes that feminist phenomenology must take an intersectional approach to its work, one that accounts for the fact that gender cannot be treated in a vacuum apart from other axes of oppression. Education and career Al-Saji received a bachelor's degree from McMaster University in 1993, a master's degree in Philosophy from KU Leuven in 1995, and a doctorate in Philosophy from Emory University in 2002. After receiving her doctorate, Al-Saji accepted a teaching position at McGill University, an institution she is still at. In her time at McGill (and previously, as a graduate student,) Al-Saji published a number of papers in peer-reviewed journals. She is also working on a manuscript, tentatively titled The Time of Difference: Thinking memory, perception and ethics with Bergson and Merleau-Ponty. Al-Saji is the editor of the feminist philosophy section of the journal Philosophy Compass. She is a co-editor of the Symposia on Gender, Race and Philosophy. Al-Saji has held a number of fellowships, including one at the Institute of Advanced Study at Durham University in 2012, where she carried out research related to the theme of time, and one at The Camargo Foundation in Cassis, France. Research areas Much of Al-Saji's work has represented an effort to forge links between 20th century phenomenology and French philosophy and critical race and feminist theories. A significant theme of her work has been the question of time. Al- Saji's research has two distinct tracks: the first looks at questions of embodiment, memory, and intersubjectivity, and the second attempts to develop a phenomenology of \\"cultural racism,\\" especially through feminist analysis of the depiction of Muslim women in modern western contexts. Al-Saji's work has touched upon the work of many scholars before her, including Henri Bergson, Edmund Husserl, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Jean Paul Sartre, and many others, although her work has primarily focused on Bergson and Merleau-Ponty.

New Texas was a colony established in S√£o Paulo, Brazil by remnants of the Confederacy after their surrender in the American Civil War. The New Texas colony's leader was Frank McMullen. The colonists were shipwrecked on the coast of Cuba during their first attempt to get to Brazil, and only successfully made their way there on their second attempt. McMullen died of tuberculosis about two years after the establishment of the colony.  Background  Following the end of the American Civil War, many former Confederates desired to flee the now-unified United States of America. This inclination was fueled by resentment towards their new \\"oppressive\\" leaders, along with a conviction that the economic and political conditions of the South would be slow to improve during the era of Reconstruction. For some, they chose to flee to another country in hopes of preserving their former way of life, including slavery, but as immigration was an expensive action, not all were able to participate. In addition to this, several Confederate leaders (including General Robert E. Lee) discouraged individuals from leaving the country. One popular destination for these displaced citizens was Brazil due to the fact slavery was still legal, resulting in up to 20,000 people immigrating from the South.  Initial settlement  In 1865, Frank McMullen left for Brazil with 154 former citizens of the Confederacy in hopes of starting a successful colony. They were hoping to take advantage of the lax immigration laws of Brazil at the time. The Emperor of Brazil at the time, Dom Pedro II, actively encouraged Confederate immigration; there were efforts to provide financial assistance and land to the incoming Southerners. McMullen decided to start his settlement on a 50 square-leagues plot of land South of S√£o Paulo, leading to the official foundation of New Texas.

It is maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. Location The cemetery is in Kalamaria, a district of Thessaloniki, it is located between the army camp of Dalipi and the communal Greek cemetery in Kalamaria, off Konstantinou Karamanli Street. History During the First World War, Thessaloniki had been the headquarters of the British Salonika Force, containing eighteen various hospitals. Three of the hospitals in Thessaloniki were Canadian though no Canadian soldiers were members of the Commonwealth force. Commonwealth forces had been interred in local Protestant and Roman Catholic cemeteries, prior to the opening of the Mikra cemetery. Additionally the Anglo-French Military Cemetery, on the Lembet Road, was used from November 1915 to October 1918. The cemetery holds 1,810 Commonwealth burials of the First World War, and 147 other war graves from other nationalities.

The linear time-invariant state equation given by :\\\\frac {dx(t)}{dt}=Ax(t)+Bu(t)+Ew(t), with state vector x, control vector u, vector w of additive disturbances, and fixed matrices A, B, and E, can be solved by using either the classical method of solving linear differential equations or the Laplace transform method. The Laplace transform solution is presented in the following equations. The Laplace transform of the above equation yields :sX(s)-x(0)=AX(s)+BU(s)+EW(s) where x(0) denotes initial- state vector evaluated at t=0 . Solving for X(s) gives :X(s)=(sI-A)^{-1} x(0) + (sI-A)^{-1}[BU(s)+EW(s)]. So, the state-transition equation can be obtained by taking inverse Laplace transform as :x(t)=L^{-1}[(sI-A)^{-1}] x(0) + L^{-1} {(sI-A)^{-1} [BU(s) + EW(s)]}= \\\\phi(t)x(0)+\\\\int_{0}^{t} \\\\phi(t-\\\\tau)[Bu(\\\\tau)+Ew(\\\\tau)]dt . The state-transition equation as derived above is useful only when the initial time is defined to be at t=0 . In the study of control systems, specially discrete-data control systems, it is often desirable to break up a state-transition process into a sequence of transitions, so a more flexible initial time must be chosen. Let the initial time be represented by t_0 and the corresponding initial state by x(t_0), and assume that the input u(t) and the disturbance w(t) are applied at t‚â•0. Starting with the above equation by setting t=t_0, and solving for x(0), we get : x(0)= \\\\phi (-t_0)x(t_0)-\\\\phi(-t_0)\\\\int_{0}^{t_0}\\\\phi(t_0 - \\\\tau)[Bu(\\\\tau)+Ew(\\\\tau)]d\\\\tau. Once the state-transition equation is determined, the output vector can be expressed as a function of the initial state.

He was also briefly proclaimed as an anti- Caliph in a rebellion against the Fatimid Caliphate in Palestine in 1012/3. Abu al-Futuh succeeded his brother Isa as Emir of Mecca in 384 AH (994/5 CE). He was a member of the Ja'farid dynasty, a Hasanid family that had come to rule Mecca . The family may have had Zaydi leanings, and recognized the suzerainty of the Fatimid Caliphate. In July 1012, at the instigation of Abu'l-Qasim al-Husayn ibn Ali al-Maghribi, a former Fatimid vizier, he was briefly acclaimed as anti-Caliph with the title of al-Rashid bi-llah (\\"Righteous with God\\") during the Jarrahid-led Bedouin revolt against the Fatimid rule in Palestine. He raised a considerable sum of money and joined the rebels in their capital of Ramla, where he was initially warmly received and acclaimed as \\"Commander of the Faithful\\". Soon, however, the money he had brought with him ran out and the Jarrahids ceased to respect him, while they were willing to receive gifts and money from the Fatimid Caliph, al-Hakim bi- Amr Allah. Disheartened, Hasan returned to Mecca and Fatimid allegiance, while the Jarrahid rebellion was crushed by the Fatimid troops in late summer 1013. The motives for his revolt are not entirely clear. On one part they were practical: the Hejaz had suffered due to the cessation of grain shipments, as well as monetary subsidies, from Egypt for the few years preceding the revolt, and the sources explicitly mention that this had caused grievances on the part of al-Hasan. However, the unprecedented decision to actually proclaim a counter-caliphate clearly had ideological motivation as well, being possibly prodded by al-Hakim's demand in 1005 to ritually curse the first two Rashidun caliphs across the Fatimid domains. Abu al-Futuh died in 430 AH (1038/9), as mentioned by Ibn al-Athir. He was succeeded as Emir by his only son Shukr.

It deals with how facts may change over time.Ajay Heble, The tumble of reason. Alice Munro's discourse of absence, University of Toronto Press, Toronto, Ontario, 1994, , p. 127. The story is 17 pages in length and made up of 7 sections with the shortest section being the final one.  Synopsis  Janet, a divorced, middle-aged writer who has become somewhat successful, is visiting her dying father in a Toronto hospital, where she had driven him the day before. She stays overnight in the apartment of her younger daughter, Judith, who is taking a holiday with her boyfriend, and thinks about (and misses) her older daughter, Nichola, who prefers not to be in touch. Her father, who had initially decided against surgery (which meant a life expectancy of maybe three more months), has changed his mind and is scheduled for surgery the next day. Janet, who had started coming to terms with his prognosis, is unsettled because surgery means the risk of death on the table; in an effort to regain her composure, she goes to a planetarium and stays for a presentation, which prompts many realizations, among them that what was once fact can be supplanted by new information, new facts. That evening at the hospital, she quizzes her father on the moons of Jupiter and the mythical origins of the name of the moon Ganymede, knowing that these might be the last words she will ever hear him utter. The story ends with her reflecting on the moments after the planetarium show earlier that day, in which she came to some acceptance of her older daughter's and father's respective decisions and then returned to the hospital.  Interpretation and criticism  In her congratulatory statement on Alice Munro's Nobel Prize in Literature 2013 in The Guardian, Margaret Atwood said with reference to this story that, first, success must first be striven for, and then it seems one has to apologize for it. Munro's characters are being punished even though they are successful, viz the example of the writer Janet in \\"The Moons of Jupiter\\", says Atwood.https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/oct/11/alice-munro Alice Munro: an appreciation by Margaret Atwood], by Margaret Atwood, The Guardian, 11 October 2013 Tim McIntyre, in an analysis of 2009, points out that Munro's realism with its \\"capacity for characterization, compassion, and presence\\" is made to function in opposition to the author's \\"sophisticated understanding of language's inability to represent perfectly either the world or the totality of being.\\"Tim McIntyre, ‚ÄúThe Way the Stars Really Do Come Out at Night‚Äù.

He succeeded his father Qutb al-din Hasan in 1100. When Husayn ascended the Ghurid throne, his kingdom was in chaos. However, he managed to restore peace, and strengthen his kingdom. During Husayn's late reign, the Seljuq sultan Ahmad Sanjar invaded his domains, defeated him, and captured him. However, Sanjar later released Husayn in return for sending tribute to him. After Husayn's death in 1146, he was succeeded by his son Sayf al-Din Suri. Husayn also had 6 other sons who later divided the Ghurid kingdom among themselves.History of Civilizations of Central Asia, C.E. Bosworth, M.S. Asimov, p. 185.
