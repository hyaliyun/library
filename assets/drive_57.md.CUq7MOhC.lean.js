It is synthesized by combining a strontium salt with a strong base. Sr(OH)2 exists in anhydrous, monohydrate, or octahydrate form. Preparation Because Sr(OH)2 is slightly soluble in cold water, its preparation can be easily carried out by the addition of a strong base such as NaOH or KOH, drop by drop to a solution of any soluble strontium salt, most commonly Sr(NO3)2 (strontium nitrate). The Sr(OH)2 will precipitate out as a fine white powder. From here, the solution is filtered, and the Sr(OH)2 is washed with cold water and dried. Applications Strontium hydroxide is used chiefly in the refining of beet sugar and as a stabilizer in plastic. It may be used as a source of strontium ions when the chlorine from strontium chloride is undesirable. Strontium hydroxide absorbs carbon dioxide from the air to form strontium carbonate. Safety Strontium hydroxide is a severe skin, eye and respiratory irritant. It is harmful if swallowed.

As such it is also known as Kells and Connor in which they share a primary school, library, development association etc. It is in Mid and East Antrim District Council. Kells and Connor had a population of 2,053 people (808 households) in the 2011 Census. An old stone bridge crosses the Kells Water, separating Kells from Connor. There is a gate community around kells due to past history. A Christian settlement in Connor was established in 480 AD and a Monastery in Kells in 500 AD.  History  There is much evidence, from written sources and archaeological material, that Connor was a sizeable, complex settlement in the Early Christian period, probably with monastic and secular elements coexisting. The church of the early monastic establishment at Connor was re-built as the cathedral of the medieval Diocese of Connor and Kells. It was destroyed in the Confederate wars of the mid seventeenth century and replaced by the present Church of St Saviour early in the nineteenth century, its foundation stone for the church being laid in 1811 and the building consecrated in 1813. During the Middle Ages, an Augustinian community was established at Kells nearby. This Augustinian Abbey survived into the early seventeenth century, but was burnt in 1641. Only one wall and some short runs of wall remain of the Abbey and these are now preserved in the grounds of Dinsmore's textile factory. Connor was the site of a significant battle between the invading army of Edward Bruce and Richard Óg de Burgh, 2nd Earl of Ulster, on 9 September 1315. Following the defeat of the Anglo-Normans by the Scots army Connor was sacked. Kells and Connor was the location where the 1859 Ulster revival started.  Transport  * Kells was formerly served by the Ballymena and Larne Railway, a narrow gauge railway. Kells railway station opened on 24 August 1878, closed for passenger traffic on 31 January 1933 and finally closed altogether on 3 June 1940.

The music for the game was written by David Whittaker. Plot From the game's instructions: :The city of Amaurote has been invaded by huge, aggressive insects who have built colonies in each of the city's 25 sectors. As the only uninjured army officer left after the invasion (that'll teach you for hiding!) the job falls to you to destroy all the insect colonies. Gameplay An insect chases the Arachnus The player controls an \\"Arachnus 4\\", an armoured fighting-machine that moves on four legs. The player must first select a sector to play in via a map screen and then control the Arachnus as it wanders an isometric (top-down in the Commodore 64 version) view of the cityscape attacking marauding insects and searching for the insect queen using a scanner. The Arachnus attacks by launching bouncing bombs. It can only launch one at a time so if a bomb misses its intended target the player will have to wait until it hits the scenery or bounces against the fence of the play area before he can fire again. Once the queen has been located, the player can radio-in a \\"supa-bomb\\" which can be used to destroy the queen. The player can also radio-in other supplies such as additional bombs and even ask to be pulled out of the combat zone. Extra weaponry costs the player \\"dosh\\", the in- game currency.

Biography Born in Bosco Marengo, he was the son of Marco Bonelli, inscribed as a noble of Alessandria in Piedmont, 1566, and of Dominina de' Gibertis, niece of Pope Pius V. He was the great- uncle of Cardinal Carlo Bonelli (1664). He entered the preaching Order of Dominicans, taking the name Michele, and professed at the convent of Santa Maria sopra Minerva, Rome, 1559. He studied at the Collegio Germanico and was a professor of theology at the University of Perugia before being recalled to Rome by his great-uncle, Pius V. He was created cardinal priest in the consistory of 6 March 1566; received the red hat and the titulus of Santa Maria sopra Minerva on 20 March and was entered with his father as a noble of Alessandria the same year; he conditioned his promotion on permission to continue wearing his Dominican habit. He was made Grand Prior in Rome of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, June 1568. He was charged with the important post of Camerlengo on 3 December 1568, a post he held until 10 May 1570, when he resigned the post so that his uncle could sell it to Cardinal Luigi Cornaro for 70,000 scudi, to raise funds for the war against the Turks : see Battle of Lepanto (1571). In recompense he was given the sinecure of Abbot commendatario of San Michele della Chiusa. As papal Rome was expanding, he took the initiative of developing a new quarter erected above the ancient imperial fora, laying out streets --of which via Alessandrina commemorates his title-- which had come to be divided among the monasteries of S.Basilio, S.Adriano and SS.Cosma e Damiano, and planted in orchards. His family shared in the honours during the pontificate of Pius V: his brother Girolamo, commander of the Papal Guard, was made marchese di Cassano d’Adda (1572), and his brother Michele, having been made duca di Salci (1569), became a gentleman-in-waiting to the duke of Savoy (1573). The \\"Cardinale Alessandrino\\", as he was styled--a title that had been borne by Pius V as a cardinal-- was sent as legate to the kings of Spain and Portugal on 18 June 1571, with the honour of cardinal nipote, in the company of Francesco Borgia, and was sent as legate with the same discretionary powers a latere to the king of France on 16 November 1571. The question of his advance notice of the imminent Saint Bartholomew's Day Massacre beginning the following 24 August has been discussed among historians and emphatically denied in the Catholic Encyclopedia . Cardinal Alessandrino administered the last rites to his great- uncle the pope in May 1572 and participated in the ensuing conclave. Member of the Congregation of the Index Librorum Prohibitorum, 1572, of the Council, 1573.

It is most often shaped by political and policy elites, but can also be influenced by non-governmental activist groups, private sector lobbyists, think tanks, courts, and world events. Media coverage has also been linked to the success of the rise of political parties and their ability to get their ideas on the agenda (see agenda-setting). Although the media does often have an effect on the political agenda, these results are not always immediate. When there is a great time difference between decisions and results it is called a political agenda lag. Political agenda is strongly tied to state centralisation. The more centralized a state, the more citizens will likely try to affect the political agenda. For this reason, many political elites tend to prefer a non- centralized state where they can maintain more control over the political agenda. The “Political Agenda Effect” asserts that when citizens from different backgrounds get together, their agenda will change in a way that takes their demands away from elites to focus more on public goods. The “Escalation Effect” contends that if citizens get together, this will induce elites to form national resources to fight against them and maintain the political agenda the way they desire. The impact agenda is the increasing requirements for researchers to prove that there are real world impacts from their research. It is related to the political agenda because often governments measure a positive real world impact only in terms of the political agenda they have. When it comes to building the political agenda, there are three main models which are commonly cited: the outside initiative model, mobilization model, and inside initiative model.  What Players Affect the Political Agenda  = Political and Policy Elites = The political agenda is essentially defined as what governmental officials find important to discuss. Those closest to the policy process have the biggest control on what issues reach the political agenda. They are the ones with the most power to decide which ideas or issues have the most importance, and which ideas or issues are unimportant. For example, the President of the United States, has the power to make treaties, appoint ambassadors, appoint judges of the supreme court etc. These types of powers ultimately shape what voices are present in parliament and subsequently what issues reach the political agenda. = Non- governmental Activist Groups = Some non-governmental activist groups, such as neighborhood associations, advocate for civic beautification or improvement of communities. Many other important activist groups, like those oriented towards human rights and social justice, campaign for broad ideals. These groups work to put continuous pressure on government leaders that shape the agenda. If enough pressure is exerted onto political leaders through activist groups, it can change which issues and ideas ultimately reach the political agenda. For example the American Bar Association (ABA) and the American Medical Association (AMA), usually try to influence politicians on professional jobs. = Think tanks = Think tanks are in need of financial backing. Most times wealthy and established investors who wish to advance a certain idea or cause onto the political agenda establish them. These issues or causes may include: economics, taxes, foreign policy, global development, education, children and families, or healthcare. Examples of think tanks that promote a certain political perspective onto the political agenda are the Heritage Foundation and American Enterprise Institute which are highly conservative. On the other side, the Center for American Progress, are more liberal with their motives. = Courts = When the courts make a decision that changes a previous line of thinking, that idea immediately is on the political agenda because laws and public administration must change accordingly. The Mabo decision by the High Court in 1992 which overturned previous laws about establishing native titles is an example of this. = World Events = When something unexpected happens it can force the political agenda to change immediately. For example, when Hurricane Katrina or the World Trade Centre attacks occurred they were unexpected but priority changing events. When big world events (i.e. disasters/tragedies) occur they are often followed by a policy response as well, and so what issues and ideas reach the political agenda are sometimes changed simply due to what happened in the world.  Varying Theories on Who Sets the Agenda  There are three main theories on how political agendas are set and which groups have the greatest say in the decisions regarding them. They are; the pluralist theory, the elitist theory, and the institutional theory. = The Pluralist theory = The pluralist theory suggests that policy-making is divided into several categories or “arenas”. Groups that do not have any power in one particular arena, most often have power in another arena. There is a marketplace for competing policies, and interests, and any group may win the arena. Elections often determine who gets to decide on each public policy. = The Elitist Theory = In the elitist theory a main power elite dominates the entire agenda setting process to serve their own interests. These interests hold the power in all the arenas and they always win every election. There are very few people that actually organize into separate interest groups. In order to retain power and control, the main elite works at keeping key issues off the agenda. This suppression of issues threatens democracy. = The Institutional Theory = This theory believes that legislative committees and bureaucratic institutions are the main controllers of the agenda. Because social interests and issues have much impact on what is considered by the legislative committees and bureaucratic institutions, individuals do not benefit from agenda decisions. This type of system leads to more conservative policy decisions than those under the pluralist scenario, but far more conservative than under the elite scenario.  Political Agenda and the Media  The media is tightly linked to what issues gain importance on the political agenda. It affects what ideas become widespread and therefore what is demanded from politicians. Numerous studies have done research to prove this: Hajo B Boomgaarden and Rens Vliegenthart write on the media’s relation to political agenda in their article Explaining the rise of anti-immigrant parties: The role of news media content. In this article they study the media coverage on anti-immigration in the Netherlands for the period of 1990 to 2002 and found that it directly relates to the success of anti-immigration populist parties such as Centrumdemocraten (CD), the Centrum Partij (CP), and the Lijst Pim Fortuyn (LPF) during the same time period. Their analysis used the importance of news media as the explanatory factor of why anti-immigration gained prevalence on the political agenda, while controlling for other real world factors and developments at the time such as the influence of the economy, immigration, or the leadership of then President Pim Fortuyn. This was done by conducting a content analysis of five of the most popular Dutch national newspapers. The empirical results showed support of anti-immigration was around 4% in 1994, and rose to 16% in 2001 during the same time that media coverage of anti-immigration was at its peak. This means, the test showed that media content can be held at least partly responsible for the rise of anti- immigrant parties in the Netherlands and the changing of the political agenda in this way. A similar study done by Julie Sevenans, Stefaan Walgrave & Gwendolyn Joanna Epping compares the behavior of politicians in comparison to the media on a global scale. The study was completed during one week, in Flemish Belgium. Every day, eight news outlets were studied and fully coded for a total of 2448 cases. The study looked at individual politicians cognitive attention for these specific news stories, via a face-to face survey of MPs to see if they recalled, had talked about, or considered the content covered in these news outlets. The results showed that the prominence and usefulness of a news story affect whether a news story is noticed, talked about or considered by MPs. This work showed that political agenda-setting effects most likely begin from the selective adoption on the cognitive, and individual level of MPs. Politicians both consume the news much how regular citizens by paying more attention the most prominent stories. However, they are also selective in that they pay the most attention to news that is political in nature or match their interests. More specifically, politicians pay more attention to: news that is more prominent, about the region their parliament is responsible for, issues they are personally specialized in, news about issues that are salient for their party, and news about politics. All of these claims were confirmed by statistical analysis. Relating to the political agenda, the implications of the fact that MPs care so much about media reports are twofold: some MPs may think media coverage is reflective of public opinion, while others may feel the media affect what the public sees as important. In either case, politicians are interpreting that the public cares about major news stories and taking this into account when setting the political agenda. George Edwards and Dan Wood conducted a time series analysis of presidential, mass media and congressional attention to five political issues: crime, education, health care, U.S.-Soviet relations, and the Arab- Israeli conflict. The end conclusion was that most of the time presidents react corresponding to fluctuations in media attention on an issue. It too showed a relationship between the media and political agenda.  Political Agenda Lag  Although the media does often have an effect on the political agenda, these results are not always immediate. Dearing and Rogers (1996) conducted a study on this and concluded that time lags from what is in the media transferring in the political agenda can take up to a few weeks to several months.  Political Agenda and State Centralization  The political agenda is tied to state centralization because the more centralized a state is, the more political elites have control over the political agenda. However if a state is too centralized, the more the public may feel they need they need to advocate to change the political agenda as well. The Political Agenda can be further broken down into two concepts: the political agenda effect, and the escalation effect. = The Political Agenda Effect = The political agenda effect states that state centralization alters the dynamics of political action and conflict in society. State centralization, which involves elites coordinating nationally, induces citizens to organize nationally as well, rather than at the local or the “parochial” level. When this happens and citizens from different regions, sectors, interests, backgrounds, or ethnicity all join together to organize and discuss certain policies their agenda will change in a direction that switches their demands from power-holders to focus more on public goods. In this case then a state that has a higher level of centralization it may incite citizens to try to change the agenda themselves. Therefore, political elites might instead prefer a non-centralized state where they can still maintain more control over the political agenda. Elites may strategically opt for a non-centralized state in order to induce the citizens to not organize nationally and thus avert the political agenda effect. = The Escalation Effect = The “Escalation Effect” contends that if citizens get together, it will force elites to form national resources to fight against them and maintain the political agenda the way they desire. In the case that citizens band together in a national organization, this will entice political elites to also form a national organization and pool their resources together in attempt to fight against the citizens. National organizations created by citizens might have a lower probability of success in comparison to organizations formed by elites, but in either case they will still indirectly benefit the weaker citizen groups, who would have otherwise remained unorganized. An escalation of the conflict can be seen as ensuing in this scenario.  The Impact Agenda  The beginnings of the concept of the “impact agenda” can be traced to William Waldegrave’s 1993 white paper “Realizing Our Potential”. The impact agenda describes how there are increasing requirements set out by the state for researchers to relate their studies to real world issues in order to validate their research and access government funding. This is shown by the fact that the Biological and Sciences Research Council announced in 2012 that it expects its institutes to detail impact. This idea has been heavily criticized by scientists for allowing non-scientists to pick winners and losers and for constraining researchers to only create an impact that is aligned with the government's political agenda.  Models of Political Agenda Building  Roger Cobb, Jennie Keith Ross and Marc Howard Ross developed the “models of agenda building” theory to specify three different models: the outside initiative model, mobilization model, and inside initiative model. These models are designed to show the different ways the political agenda changes. The study related success of an idea being translated from the \\"public agenda\\" (being discussed regularly) to the “formal agenda” (government taking serious considerations into making changes in that specific area). Success in this study meant an issue was placed on the formal agenda and given attention by decision makers. Results showed that achieving agenda status is more difficult in modern nations than in smaller nations rooted in face-to-face interaction. More specifically: # The more homogeneous a society is, the higher the ability to achieve agenda status # A higher internal migration rate and population increase, means achieving agenda status will be more difficult # The higher amount of potential agendas in which a specific issue may be placed, the higher the success rate of reaching the political agenda # The fewer issues around redistribution of material resources in a given society, the greater the chance of reaching the political agenda The study also found that there are components of political agendas that hold true across nations and across different models: # The greater the proportion of issues not reaching the formal agenda, the higher the level of discontent and political instability within the wider community # As the time gap between an issue being raised and it reaching formal agenda status increases, so does public instability = Outside initiative model = The outside initiative model discusses the process where issues arise in non- governmental organizations and then are expanded to reach the formal agenda. The order of events starts with a grievance, an expansion of interest supported by nongovernmental groups, and then an exertion of pressure onto decision makers. It is about the process through which issues arise in non- governmental groups and are then expanded sufficiently to reach, first the public agenda and then the formal agenda. The outside initiative model is most prevalent in egalitarian societies. = The mobilization model = The mobilization model is focused around political agenda issues that are initiated within government and subsequently reach the public agenda and formal agenda status. Its focus is on the internal mechanism and how politicians work to get ideas formalized onto the agenda. However, success in implementation does require support from the public under this model as well. The mobilization model is most commonly linked with hierarchical societies, or those societies which emphasize a wide gap between the leader and his or her followers. = Inside initiative model = The inside initiative model describes when issues are initiated within government, but supporters make no effort to expand it to the public. It is a model that is opposed to public participation. Instead, supporters of the issues rely solely on their own ability to apply the right amount of pressure to ensure formal agenda status. The inside access model is most often seen in societies with high concentrations of wealth and status.

She was born only five days before the first anniversary of the original ascension of Mount Everest by Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary. She completed her M.A. and B.Ed. from D.A.V. Post Graduate College, Dehradun. She got her first taste of mountaineering thrill at the age of 12, along with her friends, scaled a high peak during a school picnic. On the invitation of her school principal, she was sent to college for higher studies and during her course at Nehru Institute of Mountaineering, became the first girl in 1982 to climb Mt. Gangotri and Mt. Rudragaria . In that time, she got employment as an instructor at the National Adventure Foundation (NAF), which had set up an adventure school for training women to learn mountaineering. Pal encountered stiff opposition from her family and relatives when she decided to opt for a career as a professional mountaineer rather than as a schoolteacher. She soon found success in her chosen field, however. After summitting a number of smaller peaks, she was selected to join India's first mixed-gender team to attempt an expedition to Mount Everest in 1984. Ascent In 1984, India had scheduled its fourth expedition, christened \\"Everest'84\\", to Mount Everest. Bachendri Pal was selected as one of the members of the elite group of six Indian women and eleven men who were privileged to attempt ascent to the Mount Everest (Sagarmatha in Nepalese). The news filled them with a sense of ecstasy and excitement. The team was flown to Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, in March 1984, and from there the team moved onwards. Recalling her first glimpse of the Mount Everest, Bachendri once reminisced: \\"We the hill people have always worshipped the mountains…my overpowering emotion at this awe-inspiring spectacle was, therefore, devotional.\\"Book: ' st – My Journey to the Top, an autobiography published By National Book Trust, Delhi The team commenced its ascent in May 1984. Her team almost met disaster when an avalanche buried its camp, and more than half the group abandoned the ascent because of injury or fatigue. Bachendri Pal and the remainder of the team pressed on to reach the summit. Bachendri Pal recalls this accident: \\"I was sleeping in one of the tents with my teammates at Camp III at an altitude of . On the night of 15–16 May 1984, at around 00:30 hours IST, I was jolted awake; something had hit me hard; I also heard a deafening sound and soon after I found myself being enveloped within a very cold mass of material.\\" On 22 May 1984, Ang Dorje (the Sherpa sirdar) and some other climbers joined the team to ascend to the summit of Mount Everest; Bachendri was the only woman in this group. They reached the South Col and spent the night there at Camp IV at the altitude of . On 23 May 1984, early morning at 6:20 a.m., they continued the ascent, climbing \\"vertical sheets of frozen ice\\"; cold winds were blowing at the speed of about 100 km per hour and temperatures touching minus 30 to 40 degrees Celsius. On 23 May 1984, the team reached the summit of Mount Everest at 1:07 p.m. IST and Bachendri Pal created history. She achieved this feat on the day before her 30th birthday, and six days before the 31st anniversary of the first ascension to Mount Everest. After Bachendri Pal continued to be active after ascending the highest peak in the world. She successfully led: *An \\"Indo- Nepalese Women’s Mount Everest Expedition – 1993\\" team comprising only women, which set benchmarks for Indian mountaineering when 18 people reached the summit including 7 women. *All women team of rafters in \\"The Great Indian Women's Rafting Voyage – 1994\\", which had 18 women in 3 rafts. It was a pioneering effort by women in successfully completing the journey in the river Ganges from Haridwar to Calcutta, covering 2155 km. in 39 days. *The \\"First Indian Women Trans-Himalayan Expedition – 1997\\", which was an effort by 8 women, who completed the trekking journey from the eastern part of the Himalayas from Arunachal Pradesh to the western part of the Himalayas at Siachen Glacier reaching Indira Col – the northernmost tip of India at the altitude of , covering more than 4500 km in '225' days by crossing more than 40 high Mountain passes. This is the first success by any country. Social service Bachendri Pal along with Premlata Agarwal and a group of ace climbers, which includes Mt. Everest summiteers arrived in Uttarkashi and carried out relief and rescue operations in the remotest high altitude villages of the Himalayas that had been ravaged in the 2013 North India floods. Awards and accolades President Ram Nath Kovind presenting the Padma Bhushan Award to Bachendri Pal, at an Investiture Ceremony, at Rashtrapati Bhavan, in New Delhi on 16 March 2019Bachendri Pal has been conferred with following awards and accolades: *Gold Medal for Excellence in Mountaineering by the Indian Mountaineering Foundation (1984) *Padma Shri – the fourth highest civilian award of the Republic of India (1984) *Gold Medal by the Department of Education, Government of Uttar Pradesh, India (1985) *Arjuna Award by the Government of India (1986) *Calcutta Ladies Study Group Award (1986) *Listed in the Guinness Book of World Records (1990) *National Adventure Award by the Government of India (1994) *Yash Bharti Award by the Government of Uttar Pradesh, India (1995) *Honorary Doctorate from the Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna Garhwal University (formerly known as Garhwal University) (1997) *She is the first recipient of the Virangana Lakshmibai Rashtriya Samman 2013–14, which was given by the Ministry of Culture, Government of Madhya Pradesh, India at Gwalior on 18 June 2013 for her personal achievement in adventure sports and women's upliftment in the country. *Padma Bhushan – the third highest civilian award of the Republic of India (2019) Books and publications *Author of \\"Everest – My Journey to the Top\\", (an autobiography published By National Book Trust, Delhi) Further reading * See also *List of Mount Everest records of India *List of Mount Everest records *List of Mount Everest summiters by number of times to the summit *H.

Farmanieh has one of, if not the highest household income rates in Tehran, being home to many embassies, nobles and notables of Iran. The name of Farmanieh is based on Farmanfarmaian house, one of the noble houses in Qajar dynasty era who used to own much of the land in the area.

The main street of the neighborhood is called Farmanieh Avenue. West end of the street leads to Dezashib area, while the east end leads to Farmanieh roundabout at the intersection with northern Pasdaran Avenue. The official post-revolutionary name for Farmanieh Street is Dr. Lavasani Avenue; however, this name is rarely used colloquially. The street extends for about 7-8 kilometers. History Farmanfarma Farmanieh district in 1930s by Annemarie Schwarzenbach Farmanieh used to belong to the house of Qajar Dynasty royal prince Abdol Hossein Mirza Farmanfarma (after whom Farmanieh is named). Over years, the original estate was divided between family members and parts of it were sold off to the larger public. The last few decades have seen an almost feverish rate of development in the area, spurred by the construction of the Sadr Expressway along the district's southern edge. Today, Farmanieh's skyline is dominated by residential towers and commercial skyscrapers, including the Kuh-e Noor banking plaza and shopping center.

History It is believed that the Pandya kings of Tamil Nadu fled to Pandalam in the face of an attack from Cholas and settled there in the land they bought from Kaipuzha Thampan, a landlord. The Pandya dynasty had provinces on either sides of the Western Ghats. The King of Pandalam helped Marthanda Varma to conquer the Kayamkulam province. In return for this help, Marthanda Varma did not attempt to attack and conquer Pandalam during the expansion of his kingdom. The princely state of Pandalam had extended up to Thodupuzha in Idukki district once. Pandalam was added to Travancore in 1820. Before the formation of Pathanamthitta district, Pandalam was in Mavelikara taluk of Alappuzha district. Literacy Pandalam has higher literacy rate compared to Kerala. In 2011, literacy rate of Pandalam village was 96.74% compared to 94.00% of Kerala. In Pandalam, Male literacy stands at 97.84% while female literacy rate was 95.80%.

The species was described by Frank Wall from a specimen obtained from near Tindharia near Darjeeling. The species is also found at Jalpaiguri town and other parts of the district. This species inhabits a wide variety of habitats from mangrove swamps to inhabited villages to montane forests up to elevations of above sea level on the Himalayan foothills. Behavior and ecology A nocturnal and terrestrial snake, B. niger has an inoffensive disposition. When disturbed, it coils loosely and hides its head beneath its body. It is reluctant to bite except upon persistent provocation. It preys mostly on snakes and small mammals and occasionally lizards, frogs, and fish. Venom The venom of B. niger consists of both presynaptic and postsynaptic neurotoxins, and may also contain myotoxins. This snake is often overlooked, but it is a medically important species, as it has caused many bites. The mortality rate associated with it is not known, but is said to be quite high.

HIFU can be used to increase the flow of blood or lymph, or to destroy tissue, such as tumors, through a number of mechanisms. The technology can be used to treat a range of disorders and as of 2015 is at various stages of development and commercialization. The technology is similar to ultrasonic imaging, although lower frequencies and continuous, rather than pulsed waves are used to achieve the necessary thermal doses. However, pulsed waves may also be used if mechanical rather than thermal damage is desired. Acoustic lenses are often used to achieve the necessary intensity at the target tissue without damaging the surrounding tissue. An analogy is using a magnifying glass to focus sunlight; only the focal point of the magnifying glass has high intensity. Although lenses have traditionally been used, phased arrays are increasingly common as they allow the focal position to be easily changed. HIFU may be combined with other imaging techniques such as medical ultrasound or MRI to enable guidance of the treatment and monitoring. Medical uses There is no clear consensus on the boundaries between HIFU and other forms of therapeutic ultrasound. In academic literature, HIFU usually refers to the high levels of energy required to destroy tissue through ablation or cavitation, although it is also sometimes used to describe lower intensity applications such as occupational therapy and physical therapy. Either way, HIFU is used to non- invasively heat tissue deep in the body without the need for an incision. The main applications are the destruction of tissue, increasing perfusion and physical therapy. The use of ultrasound in the treatment of musculoskeletal conditions is another use in the physiotherapy setting. = Neurological disorders = A focused ultrasound system is approved in Israel, Canada, Europe, Korea and Russia to treat essential tremor, neuropathic pain, and Parkinsonian tremor. This approach enables treatment of the brain without an incision or radiation. In 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Insightec's Exablate system to treat essential tremor.FDA News Release. \\"FDA approves first MRI-guided focused ultrasound device to treat essential tremor\\", FDA, July 11, 2016 Treatment for other thalamocortical dysrhythmias and psychiatric conditions are under investigation. = Uterine adenomyosis and fibroids = Treatment for symptomatic uterine fibroids became the first approved application of HIFU by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2004.Food and Drug Administration Approval, ExAblate® 2000 System – P040003 Studies have shown that HIFU is safe and effective, and that patients have sustained symptomatic relief is sustained for at least two years without the risk of complications involved in surgery or other more invasive approaches. Up to 16-20% of patients will require additional treatment. = Prostate cancer = HIFU is being studied in men with prostate cancer. HIFU was approved in the United States for prostate tissue ablation in 2015. HIFU is also being used for ablation of prostate cancer. = Other cancers = HIFU has been successfully applied in treatment of cancer to destroy solid tumors of the bone, brain, breast, liver, pancreas, rectum, kidney, testes, prostate. = Palliative care = HIFU has been found to have palliative effects. CE approval has been given for palliative treatment of bone metastasis. Experimentally, a palliative effect was found in cases of advanced pancreatic cancer. = Prostate enlargement = Treatment of prostate enlargement (benign prostatic hyperplasia) by HIFU from inside the intestine (transrectal) has turned out to be unsuccessful. In some countries, not in USA, HIFU has also been offered from the inside of the prostate, that is, via a catheter in the prostatic urethra. Evidence as of 2019 is lacking. In England the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 2018 classified the method as \\"not recommended\\".National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE): Current care pathway (for BPH), August 2018. In the US (as of 2019) not even the technical device needed for the treatment has been approved.Focused Ultrasound Foundation: Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH), Website of the PR organization of the industry. Cosmetic uses : HIFU may also be used for cosmetic purposes, to reduce vaginal laxity and for skin-tightening. The safety and effectiveness of these devices and techniques are disputed. Mechanism HIFU beams are precisely focused on a small region of diseased tissue to locally deposit high levels of energy. The focusing effect of the transducer allows high sound pressures to be delivered to a focal point without causing unwanted damage to other tissue. This increase in pressure can cause a number of effects including heating and cavitation. The transducers differ from ultrasonic imaging probes which many people are familiar with. In this picture, two examples of HIFU transducers are shown on the left. They both have acoustic bowl-shaped lenses focus the sound inside the body. For comparison, on the right is an ultrasound imaging probe that might be used for cardiac imaging. *Ultrasound sources may be used to generate regional heating and mechanical changes in biological tissue, e.g. in and cancer treatment. *Focused ultrasound may be used to generate highly localized heating to treat cysts and tumors (benign or malignant). This is known as Magnetic Resonance guided Focused Ultrasound (MRgFUS) or High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU). These procedures generally use lower frequencies than medical diagnostic ultrasound (from 0.250 to 2 MHz), but significantly higher energies. HIFU treatment is often guided by MRI. *Focused ultrasound may be used to break up kidney stones by lithotripsy. *Ultrasound may be used for cataract treatment by phacoemulsification. In 2015 the FDA authorized two HIFU devices for the ablation of prostate tissue.http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf15/DEN150011.pdf =Temperature= The temperature of tissue at the focus will rise to between 65 and 85 °C, destroying the diseased tissue by coagulative necrosis. Higher temperatures are usually avoided to prevent boiling of liquids inside the tissue. Each sonication (individual ultrasound energy deposition) treats a precisely defined portion of the targeted tissue. The entire therapeutic target is treated by using multiple sonications to create a volume of treated tissue, according to a protocol developed by the physician. Anesthesia is not required, but sedation is generally recommended. As an acoustic wave propagates through the tissue, part of it is absorbed and converted to heat. With focused beams, a very small region of heating can be achieved deep in tissues (usually on the order of millimeters). Tissue damage occurs as a function of both the temperature to which the tissue is heated and how long the tissue is exposed to this heat level in a metric referred to as \\"thermal dose\\". By focusing at more than one place or by scanning the focus, a volume can be thermally ablated. There is some evidence that HIFU can be applied to cancers to disrupt the tumor microenvironment and trigger an immune response, as well as possibly enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy. =Mechanical= At high enough acoustic intensities, cavitation (microbubbles forming and interacting with the ultrasound field) can occur. Microbubbles produced in the field oscillate and grow (due to factors including rectified diffusion), and can eventually implode (inertial or transient cavitation). During inertial cavitation, very high temperatures occur inside the bubbles, and the collapse is associated with a shock wave and jets that can mechanically damage tissue. Because the onset of cavitation and the resulting tissue damage can be unpredictable, it has generally been avoided in clinical applications thus far. However, researchers have been working on a method of controlling this cavitation, called histotripsy which often involves adding an agent that lowers the temperature at which cavitation occurs. =Theory= There are several ways to focus ultrasound—via a lens (for example, a polystyrene lens), a curved transducer, a phased array, or any combination of the three. This concentrates it into a small focal zone; it is similar in concept to focusing light through a magnifying glass. This can be determined using an exponential model of ultrasound attenuation. The ultrasound intensity profile is bounded by an exponentially decreasing function where the decrease in ultrasound is a function of distance traveled through tissue: I=I_o {e}^{-2\\\\alpha \\\\mathrm{z}} I_o is the initial intensity of the beam, \\\\alpha is the attenuation coefficient (in units of inverse length), and z is distance traveled through the attenuating medium (e.g. tissue). In this model, \\\\frac{-\\\\partial I}{\\\\partial \\\\mathrm{z}} = 2\\\\alpha I= Q is a measure of the power density of the heat absorbed from the ultrasound field. Sometimes, SAR is also used to express the amount of heat absorbed by a specific medium, and is obtained by dividing Q by the tissue density. This demonstrates that tissue heating is proportional to intensity, and that intensity is inversely proportional to the area over which an ultrasound beam is spread—therefore, focusing the beam into a sharp point (i.e. increasing the beam intensity) creates a rapid temperature rise at the focus. The amount of damage caused in the tissue can be modeled using Cumulative Equivalent Minutes (CEM). Several formulations of the CEM equation have been suggested over the years, but the equation currently in use for most research done in HIFU therapy comes from a 1984 paper by Dewey and Sapareto: \\\\mathit{CEM} = \\\\int_{t_o}^{t_f} R^{T_{\\\\mathrm{reference}}-T} dt with the integral being over the treatment time, R=0.5 for temperatures over 43 °C and 0.25 for temperatures between 43 °C and 37 °C, a reference temperature of 43 °C, and time in minutes. This formula is an empirical formula derived from experiments performed by Dewey and Sapareto by measuring the survival of cell cultures after exposure to heat. The ultrasound beam can be focused in these ways: *Geometrically, for example with a lens or with a spherically curved transducer. *Electronically, by adjusting the relative phases of elements in an array of transducers (a \\"phased array\\"). By dynamically adjusting the electronic signals to the elements of a phased array, the beam can be steered to different locations, and aberrations in the ultrasound beam due to tissue structures can be corrected. Image-guidance HIFU therapy requires careful monitoring and so is usually performed in conjunction with other imaging techniques. Pre-operative imaging, for instance CT and MRI, are usually used to identify general parameters of the target anatomy. Real-time imaging, on the other hand, is necessary for safe and accurate noninvasive targeting and therapy monitoring. Both MRI and Medical ultrasound imaging have been used for guidance in FUS treatment. These techniques are known as Magnetic Resonance guided Focused Ultrasound Surgery (MRgFUS) and Ultrasound guided Focused Ultrasound Surgery (USgFUS) respectively. MRgFUS is a 3D imaging technique which features high soft tissue contrast and provides information about temperature, thus allowing to monitor ablation. However, low frame rate makes this technique perform poorly in real-time imaging and high costs represent a significant limitation to its use. USgFUS, differently, is a 2D imaging technique in which, although no system to provide quantitative information on temperature has been commercially developed so far, several benefits are exploited, such as high frame rate (up to 1000 images per second), low cost and minimal adverse health effects. In addition, treatment outcomes can be estimated in real time through visual inspection of hyperechoic changes in standard B-mode images. History The first investigations of HIFU for non- invasive ablation were reported by Lynn et al. in the early 1940s. Extensive important early work was performed in the 1950s and 1960s by William Fry and Francis Fry at the University of Illinois and Carl Townsend, Howard White and George Gardner at the Interscience Research Institute of Champaign, Ill., culminating in clinical treatments of neurological disorders. In particular High Intensity ultrasound and ultrasound visualization was accomplished stereotaxically with a Cincinnati precision milling machine to perform accurate ablation of brain tumors. Until recently, clinical trials of HIFU for ablation were few (although significant work in hyperthermia was performed with ultrasonic heating), perhaps due to the complexity of the treatments and the difficulty of targeting the beam noninvasively. With recent advances in medical imaging and ultrasound technology, interest in HIFU ablation of tumors has increased. The first commercial HIFU machine, called the Sonablate 200, was developed by the American company Focus Surgery, Inc. (Milipitas, CA) and launched in Europe in 1994 after receiving CE approval, bringing a first medical validation of the technology for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Comprehensive studies by practitioners at more than one site using the device demonstrated clinical efficacy for the destruction of prostatic tissue without loss of blood or long term side effects. Later studies on localized prostate cancer by Murat and colleagues at the Edouard Herriot Hospital in Lyon in 2006 showed that after treatment with the Ablatherm (EDAP TMS, Lyon, France), progression-free survival rates are very high for low- and intermediate- risk patients with recurrent prostate cancer (70% and 50% respectively) HIFU treatment of prostate cancer is currently an approved therapy in Europe, Canada, South Korea, Australia, and elsewhere. , clinical trials for the Sonablate 500 in the United States are ongoing for prostate cancer patients and those who have experienced radiation failure. Use of magnetic resonance- guided focused ultrasound was first cited and patented in 1992. The technology was later transferred to InsighTec in Haifa Israel in 1998. The InsighTec ExAblate 2000 was the first MRgFUS system to obtain FDA market approval in the United States.

The species is endemic to southern and eastern Asia. Etymology The specific name, macclellandi, is in honor of John McClelland, a physician and naturalist, who worked for the East India Company.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Sinomicrurus macclellandi, p. 164). Description S. macclellandi is a small snake, about in total length (including tail), and has a thin body. Dorsally, it is reddish-brown, with thin, black cross bars, and its belly is creamy white. The head is small, round and black in color, with a broad, creamy white transverse band, and black outlines at the middle of the head. The dorsal scales on the body are smooth, and they are arranged, at midbody, in 13 parallel longitudinal rows. Geographic range S. macclellandi is found in Northern India (Assam, Sikkim, Darjeeling, Mizoram); Arunachal Pradesh (Deban - Changlang district, Chessa, Chimpu - Papum Pare district), Nepal, N Myanmar (Burma), Thailand, Vietnam, Central and Southern China (including Hong Kong, Hainan, north to Gansu and Shaanxi), Japan (Ryukyu Islands), Taiwan. Subspecies Four subspecies are recognized, including the nominate subspecies. *Sinomicrurus macclellandi iwasakii *Sinomicrurus macclellandi macclellandi *Sinomicrurus macclellandi swinhoei *Sinomicrurus macclellandi univirgatus S. m. iwasakii is found on Ishigaki Island and other Ryukyu Islands in Japan. S. m. swinhoei is found in Taiwan. S. m. univirgatus is found in Nepal, and Sikkim. Behavior and habitat S. macclellandi is mainly nocturnal and terrestrial. It occurs in forest litter, hillside, and lowland. It is often found hiding under leaves. Although this is a venomous species, it is quite docile and not likely to strike actively. Diet S. macclellandi preys on small reptiles, such as lizards and snakes. Venom Like other elapids, S. macclellandi possesses a potent neurotoxic venom, which is capable of killing a person. Bite symptoms include numbness of lips and difficulty of speech and breathing, followed by blurred vision. Severe bite victims may die of instant heart failure, although there have been only a few human deaths recorded in Thailand. Reproduction S. macclellandi is an oviparous species. Mature females lay clutches of 6-14 eggs.Das, Indraneil (2002). A Photographic Guide to Snakes and other Reptiles of India.

It is situated north of Spilsby, and in the Lincolnshire Wolds. The village was the birthplace of Henry Stubbe, the noted 17th-century Intellectual. Partney is at the intersection of the A16 and A158 roads. A village bypass diverts the road to Skegness, Ingoldmells and Chapel St. Leonards. Public transport is provided by the Connect No. 6 bus service which runs from Lincoln to Skegness. History =Partney Monastery= The existence of a Saxon Monastic house in Partney is known only from two references in Bede's Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum (The Ecclesiastical History of the English People) of 731.Bede ii.16Bede iii.11 In Bowyer's History of the Mitred Parliamentary Abbies and other 18th- and 19th- century authors Bede's placename Peartenau is identified with Bardney. But Bede mentions Peartenau and Beardeneu in adjacent paragraphs, and the link to Bardney is now discredited. Pearteneau is likely to be Partney. The monastery is thought to have been destroyed by Viking raids around 870. No archaeological trace is known, but some burials confirm Saxon occupation at that time.

Apparently unrelated to the lost Saxon monastery, the later Benedictine medieval abbey of Bardney established a hospital at Partney, run as a cell of the abbey. The hospital was dedicated to St Mary Magdalene. The chapel survived only as wall foundations as the above-ground remains have been entirely robbed out. The foundations suggest a modest rectangular stone building measuring 13.8 yards long by 7.2 yards wide with external buttresses. =Domesday= Partney appears twice in the Domesday Book, as part of the Manor of Bardney. It is rendered as \\"Partenai\\" or \\"Partene\\", Community Church of St Nicholas Partney church is dedicated to St Nicholas. It is built of greenstone in Perpendicular style and dates from the 14th century. The brick chancel was built in 1828. The porch was constructed, and the nave and aisles rebuilt, by C. E. Giles, c. 1862. The tower was partly rebuilt in 1910. In the churchyard stands a stone commemorating the marriage of Matthew Flinders within the church. The ecclesiastical parish of Partney is part of the Partney Group of the Deanery of Bolingbroke. Victory Hall, next to the church, is an amenity for local clubs and groups. The small village primary school is Church of England aided. In the past Partney held a sheep fair. Today an annual summer fair is held to raise money for local causes.

Coloration in the young is more constant. The dorsal surface may be yellow, brown, gray, or blackish, with or without ragged or clearly defined cross bands. It can be olivaceous or brownish to black above with or without a yellow or orange-colored, O-shaped mark on the hood. It has a black spot on the lower surface of the hood on either side, and one or two black cross-bars on the belly behind it. The rest of the belly is usually the same color as the back, but paler. As age advances, the snake becomes paler, wherein the adult is brownish or olivaceous. The elongated nuchal ribs enable a cobra to expand the anterior of the neck into a “hood”. A pair of fixed anterior fangs is present. The largest fang recorded measured . Fangs are moderately adapted for spitting. Adult monocled cobras reach a length of with a tail length of . Many larger specimens have been recorded, but they are rare. Adults can reach a maximum of in length.Smith, M. A. (1943) Naja naja kaouthia In: The Fauna of British India, Ceylon and Burma, Including the Whole of the Indo-Chinese Sub-Region. Reptilia and Amphibia. Volume III (Serpentes). Taylor and Francis, London. Pages 428–432. =Scalation= They have 25 to 31 scales on the neck, 19 to 21 on the body, and 17 or 15 on the front of the vent. They have 164 to 197 ventral scales and 43 to 58 subcaudal scales. Monocled cobras tend to have more than one cuneate scale on each side. The shape of the frontal scale is short and square. Ventrals in males range from 170 to 192, in females from 178 to 197. Subcaudals in males range from 48 to 61, in females from 46 to 59. Distribution and habitat Monocled cobras are distributed from India in the west through to China, Vietnam and Cambodia. They are also found on the Malay Peninsula and are native to Bangladesh, Bhutan, Myanmar, Laos, Nepal, and Thailand. These cobras can adapt to a range of habitats, from natural to anthropogenically impacted environments. They prefer habitats associated with water, such as paddy fields, swamps, and mangroves, but can also be found in grasslands, shrublands, and forests. The species also occurs in agricultural land and human settlements including cities. They can be found at elevations of up to above sea level. Ecology and behaviour Monocled cobras are terrestrial and most active at dusk. In rice-growing areas, they hide in rodent burrows in the dykes between fields and have become semi-aquatic in this type of habitat. Juveniles feed mostly on amphibians whereas adults prey on small mammals, snakes and fish. When disturbed they prefer to take flight. However, when threatened they will raise the anterior portions of their bodies, spread their hood, usually hiss loudly, and strike in an attempt to bite and defend themselves. They are often found in tree holes and areas where rodents are plentiful. Some populations of the monocled cobra have the ability to spit venom. Reproduction This is an oviparous species. Females lay 16 to 33 eggs per clutch. Incubation periods range from 55 to 73 days. Egg-laying takes place January through March. The females usually stay with the eggs. Some collaboration between males and females has been reported in Naja naja x Naja kaouthia - hybrids. Conservation status This species has been assessed as Least Concern by IUCN owing to its large distribution, tolerance of a broad range of habitats including anthropogenically altered environments, and its reported abundance. No major threats have been reported, and the species is not thought to be undergoing a significant population decline. In areas where the distribution of this species coincides with protected areas, probably providing small safeguards. Monocled cobras are harvested for the skin trade, however, collection from the wild is minimal and not likely to cause significant population declines. Naja kaouthia is listed on CITES Appendix II. Venom Monocled cobras Unraised hood, pattern The Naja kaouthia venom sources from three different localities were reported to exhibit different intravenous and subcutaneous median lethal dose: Thailand, 0.18-0.22 µg/g; Malaysia, 0.90-1.11 µg/g; and Vietnam, 0.90-1.00 µg/g, of mouse body weight. The proteomics finding revealed that the neurotoxin profiles of these Naja kaouthia were substantially different, reflecting the distinct difference in their lethal potency and response to antivenom neutralization. The major toxic components in cobra venoms are postsynaptic neurotoxins, which block the nerve transmission by binding specifically to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, leading to flaccid paralysis and even death by respiratory failure. The major α-neurotoxin in the monocled cobra's venom is a long neurotoxin, α-cobratoxin; the minor α-neurotoxin is different from cobrotoxin in one residue. The neurotoxins of this particular species are weak. The venom of this species also contains myotoxins and cardiotoxins. In case of intravenous injection the tested in mice is 0.373 mg/kg, and 0.225 mg/kg in case of intraperitoneal injection. The average venom yield per bite is approximately 263 mg dry weight. The monocled cobra causes the highest fatality due to snake venom poisoning in Thailand. Envenomation usually presents predominantly with extensive local necrosis and systemic manifestations to a lesser degree. Drowsiness, neurological and neuromuscular symptoms will usually manifest earliest; hypotension, flushing of the face, warm skin, and pain around bite site typically manifest within one to four hours following the bite; paralysis, ventilatory failure or death could ensue rapidly, possibly as early as 60 minutes in very severe cases of envenomation. However, the presence of fang marks does not always imply that envenomation actually occurred. In a preliminary study, extract of Mimosa pudica plant has been shown to possibly have neutralizing effects on the toxins present in this venom.

The species is endemic to Central Asia. Description A Caspian cobra Naja oxiana is medium in length, a heavy-bodied snake with long cervical ribs capable of expansion to form a hood. Anteriorly, the body is depressed dorsoventrally, and posteriorly it is subcylindrical. This species averages about in total length (including tail) and rarely reaches lengths over . The head is elliptical, depressed, and slightly distinct from the neck, with a short, rounded snout and large nostrils. The eye is medium in size with a round pupil. The dorsal scales are smooth and strongly oblique, with the outer two or three scale rows larger than the remainder. Juveniles tend to be pale, with a faded appearance. Juveniles have noticeable dark and light cross- bands of approximately equal width around the body. Adults of this species are completely light to chocolate brown or yellowish, with some specimens retaining traces of juvenile banding, especially the first few dark ventral bands. This species has no hood mark and no lateral throat spots. =Taxonomic note= Indian cobra (Naja naja) specimens without a hood mark are usually confused with this species, where these two coexist in Pakistan and northern India. The Caspian cobra (Naja oxiana) is never fully black, although some specimens may be quite dark. The Caspian cobra (N. oxiana) normally has several dark bands under the throat, whereas in the black phase of the Indian cobra (N. naja) from Pakistan, almost the entire throat is black. =Scalation= Naja oxiana has 23 to 27 (usually 25) dorsal scale rows at the hood, 19-23 (usually 21) just ahead of midbody, 191-210 ventrals, and 57-71 paired subcaudals; cuneate scales (small angular scales between the labials) are often absent. Distribution Naja oxiana occurs in the Transcaspian region. It is found in parts of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, the Fergana Valley, north and east Afghanistan, northeastern Iran, the northern half of Pakistan, from the Kashmir region east to the state of Himachal Pradesh in India, and in southwestern Tajikistan. There is also some anecdotal evidence of it ranging as far north as the Aral Sea on the Uzbekistan/Kazakhstan border. Habitat Naja oxiana is often found in arid and semiarid, rocky or stony, shrub or scrub covered foothills at elevations up to about above sea level. This is also the westernmost species of Asiatic cobra. Behavior and ecology Naja oxiana is generally aggressive and bad- tempered; although it will avoid humans as much as it can, it will become fiercely aggressive when threatened or cornered, and even juveniles tend to be very aggressive. When cornered and provoked, N. oxiana is liable to spread its hood, hiss, sway from side to side and strike repeatedly; however, it is not a spitter. This terrestrial species is mainly diurnal, but it may be crepuscular and nocturnal in some parts of its range during the hottest months (July and August). Caspian cobras are good climbers, and able swimmers. The Caspian cobra is often found in water and seldom found too far away from it, where it feeds on small mammals, amphibians, and birds, both during the evening, and early morning. The Caspian cobra preys mainly on rodents, toads and frogs, occasionally fish, and birds and their eggs. Quick-moving and agile, this species lives in holes in embankments or trees. Venom =Composition= The Caspian cobra is the most venomous species of cobra in the world, slightly ahead of the Philippine cobra, based on a 1992 toxinological study reported in the Indian Journal of Experimental Biology. A number of small nonenzymatic proteins are found in the venom, including neurotoxins and members of the cytotoxin family, which have been shown to cause cell death through damage to lysosomes. In addition to nonenzymatic proteins, the venom also contains nucleases, which cause tissue damage at the site of the bite and may also potentiate systemic toxicity by releasing free purines in situ. A ribonuclease isolated and purified from Caspian cobra venom, ribonuclease V1, is commonly used as a laboratory reagent in molecular biology experiments due to its unusual ability to break down structured RNA. =Toxic effects= The crude venom of N. oxiana has a lowest published lethal dose (LCLo) of 0.005 mg/kg, the lowest among all cobra species, derived from an individual case of poisoning by intracerebroventricular injection. Values for subcutaneous injection average 0.18 mg/kg (range 0.1 mg/kg - 0.26 mg/kg). The murine subcutaneous value has been estimated between 0.21 mg/kg and 0.4 mg/kg. The intravenous injection route yielded estimates between 0.037 mg/kg and 0.078 mg/kg. Average venom yield per bite for this species is between 75 and 125 mg (dry weight), but can reach up to 590 mg. The bite of this species may cause severe pain and swelling, along with severe neurotoxicity. Weakness, drowsiness, ataxia, hypotension, and paralysis of throat and limbs may appear in less than one hour after the bite. Without medical treatment, symptoms rapidly worsen and death can occur soon after a bite due to respiratory failure. A woman bitten by this species in northwestern Pakistan suffered severe neurotoxicity and died while en route to the closest hospital nearly 50 minutes after envenomation. Between 1979 and 1987, 136 confirmed bites were attributed to this species in the former Soviet Union. Of the 136, 121 received antivenom, and only 8 died. Of the 15 who did not receive antivenom, 11 died - a 73% mortality rate. Antivenom is not as effective for envenomation by this species as it is for other Asiatic cobras within the same region, like the Indian cobra (Naja naja), and massive amounts of antivenom are often required for patients. As a result, a monovalent antivenom serum is being developed by the Razi Serum and Vaccine Research Institute in Iran. The untreated mortality rate for this species is approximately 70-75%, which is among the highest of all cobra species of the genus Naja. In both Central Asia and Iran (Naja naja oxiana, Ladle Snake, p. 124). this species is responsible for high rates of snakebites and resulting mortality.

Many old cashew factories can also be seen in the locality. Coconut plantations Evoor Kanna was an iconic elephant. History =Kingdom of Kayamkulam= Kayamkulam was a medieval feudal kingdom, known as odanadu, ruled by the Kayamkulam Rajas, with their royal palaces at Eruva and Krishnapuram. Maha raja Marthanda Varma (1706–58) conquered kayamkulam and annexed its territories to Travancore. It is said that the kingdom of Kayamkulam had a huge army led by a valiant commander Yeruvayil Achutha Warrier and therefore the large army of Travancore attempted three times before they succeeded in capturing Kayamkulam. The present day palace was built in its place by Marthanda Varma after he annexed Kayamkulam to Travancore. Kayamkulam, Mavelikkara and Karunagappally were previously known as Onattukara. Kayamkulam had slave markets in the 17th century. Tourist attractions The Krishnapuram Palace, built in the 18th century, now functions as a museum.

Geographic range C. bibroni is endemic to the Western Ghats of India, essentially distributed in Karnataka State. Description The eye of C. bibroni is minute, its diameter about half its distance from the mouth. The frontal is nearly as long as its distance from the snout, much shorter than parietals. As there is no preocular, the prefrontal contacts the third upper labial. There is one very small postocular. The temporals are 1+1. There are seven upper labials, the third and fourth contacting the eye. The first lower labial is much elongate, forming a long suture with its fellow. There are two pairs of chin shields. The anterior chin shields are small, much shorter than posterior, and are in contact with third and fourth lower labials. The dorsal scales are smooth, without apical pits, and are in 13 rows at midbody. The ventrals number 222-226. The anal is entire. The subcaudals are divided and number 27-34 pairs. Coloration is cherry-red to dark purplish brown above, red beneath, with black crossbands which are sometimes continuous across the belly. The anterior part of the head is black above.

He was born in Tehran to Prince Nosrat Dowleh Firouz in 1857, and died in November 1939 at the age of 82. He was the 16th grandson of the Qajar crown prince Abbas Mirza. He fathered 26 sons and 13 daughters by 8 wives. He lived to see four sons of his first wife die within his lifetime.A chronology of the life of Abdol Hossein Mirza Farman Farma, p. 42-58; p. 66-67; in Shahzdeh's Tree. Two other sons and one daughter died in infancy. Biography Portrait of Prince Abdul Husayn Mirza (Farma Farmaian), One of 274 Vintage Photographs. Brooklyn Museum. Prince Abdol Hossein was born to Prince Nosrat Dowleh Firouz in 1857 through his wife Hajieh Homa Khanoum. According to custom, Abdol Hossein was educated at home by private tutors, studying such traditional subjects as poetry, literature, mathematics, Arabic language, and religion, along with perhaps a smattering of modern science. Since 1878, he continued his education at the Austrian Military Academy in Tehran,The Lion of Persia, p.14. , and in 1884 joined his brother Abd al-Hamid Naser al-Dowleh, then governor of Kerman, to train the local army. The following year he was reassigned to Tabriz, the capital of Iranian Azarbaijan, to become a member of the court of the Crown Prince Mozzafar al-Din Mirza and to serve as his treasurer. He also became the Commander of the Qarasuran Corps (Gendarmerie and Security Administration of Tabriz), and reorganized the Shaqaqi regiment.The Lion of Persia, p. 15-17. In 1886, Abdol Hossein Mirza's father died. In recognition of his distinguished military service, he is awarded the title of \\"Amir Tooman\\" in 1887. Shortly afterwards he married Princess Ezzat-Dowleh, daughter of the king and his first of many wives, in 1887.Shahzdeh's Tree, p. 73 Following the marriage, and out of respect for Ezzat-Dowleh and also due to her high social rank, he took no other wives for the next twenty years. During part of this time he served as Commander in Chief of the Army in Azarbaijan, Governor of Kerman (twice), Governor of Kurdistan, Governor of Fars (also twice), Governor of Kermanshah, and Governor of Azarbaijan. In his capacity as governor he founded one of Iran's first secular schools for girls. After the accession to the throne of the weak Mozzafar-al-Din Shah, Farmanfarma was instrumental in bringing about the last grand vizier Atabak-e Azam's fall, on 23 November 1896. He was then appointed commander-in-chief of the army and minister of war, took over the government as a self-appointed premier, and \\"acted as the true sovereign\\". This led to a coalition against him, and to the nomination of as premier, in March 1897. The latter persuaded the shah to dismiss Farmanfarma, to appoint him gouverneur of Fars, and finally to send him into exile in 1898. He went to Egypt, and then to Baghdad in Ottoman Mesopotamia.Farmānfarmā, Abd-al-Ḥosayn Mīrzā, in Encyclopædia Iranica online His wife Princess Ezzat-Dowleh (Mozafar din Shah's daughter), voluntarily fled with him into exile and stayed with him for five years. She was then able to convince the Shah to let Abdol Hossein Mirza Farman Farma return. Upon his return Abdol Hossein sent his sons to schools in Europe. In 1906 the ascendance of her brother Mohammad Ali Shah to the throne plunged the country into civil war again as the new shah tried to crush the democratic movement. He continued his government service by holding the posts of Minister of Justice and War Minister. He also became the leader of a party of conservative moderates. In his role as Minister for Justice he introduced the Western custom of court trials into the Persian legal system. In August 1907, Farman Farma was appointed governor general of Azerbaijan, and had to deal with an incursion of Kurdish and Ottoman expeditionary forces into Persian territory. During his stay in Tabriz he married his second wife, Mah Bagum Khanum, the daughter of a Kurdish mountain chief, in order to seal a pact.Shahzdeh's Tree, p. 107 In 1911 Farman Farma married his third wife, Massoumeh Khanum.Shahzdeh's Tree, p. 119 In 1912 the Majlis dispatched Farman Farma as commander-in-chief of an army to repel , the third son of Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar, who had laid a claim to the throne and had gathered forces in Kurdistan and Kermanshah. In this expedition Reza Khan, who would become later the Shah of Iran, served under Farman Farma's command. The expedition was eventually successful, and Farman Farma returned to Tehran in 1915. With his arrival he brought his fourth wife, Batul Khanum. The marriage, like that of his Kurdish wife, was to seal a pact.Shahzdeh's Tree, p. 137 Farman Farma was in Tehran for only one year, serving first as Minister of Interior. At the end of 1915 he became Prime Minister, but resigned a little more than two months later. The reason for this renunciation was his refusal to sign an agreement allowing Russia and Great Britain to supervise the military and financial affairs of Iran. He asserted then that « it is a shame for the grandson of Crown Prince Abbas Mirza [i.e., himself] to consent to the slavery of Iran by signing such a document ».Shahzdeh's Tree, p. 54 As a Prime Minister he established the Ministry of Health . Later, in 1924, he would create the Pasteur Institute of Iran whose first action was to introduce a smallpox vaccine . In 1916, as hostile and near anarchic conditions in Fars prevailed, the British convinced the reluctant shah to appoint Farman Farma a second time as governor general of that province. He remained in that capacity for four years, working closely with the British consul-general and with his old friend Percy Sykes. Sir Percy Sykes next to Abdol-Hossein Farmanfarma in Kerman, 1902 On his arrival in Shiraz, the entire province was in total chaos. His first task was to prevent the spread of a famine. He carried this out by organising Iran's first agricultural cooperative. To ensure his acceptance by the people of Shiraz he took his fifth wife, Fatemeh Khanum, from one of the leading local families.Shahzdeh's Tree, p. 161 He also raised an all-Iranian regiment to restore security and order to the province with the help of British General Percy Sykes who referred to Farman Farma as \\"my friend\\" in his famous History of Persia.Brigadier-General Sir Percy Sykes. A history of Persia, Vol. II. Macmillan 1921. See from Chapter LXXX onwards . Sykes referred to Farman Farma, who was well known as an Anglophile, as \\"one of the ablest men in Iran\\". Reza Shah Pahlavi behind Ahmad Shah with Abdol-Hossein Farman Farma, 1918 In 1918 he was infected by the Great Influenza Epidemic that killed one-fifth of the population in Shiraz, but he just pulled through.Brigadier-General Sir Percy Sykes. A history of Persia, Vol. II. Macmillan 1921, page 515 . He completed his term as the governor of Shiraz in 1921 when he was replaced by his nephew Dr. Mohammad Mossadegh. At about this time, he married his sixth wife, Khanum Akhtarzaman, which he divorced three or four years later.Shahzdeh's Tree, p. 177 Just after the 1921 British- assisted coup of Reza Shah, his prime minister Zia'eddin Tabatabaee arrested and held in custody members of the political elites of all persuasions, partly to head off political opposition and partly to extort money. Thus, upon his return to Tehran Farman Farma was arrested with his two elder sons, Nosrat Dowleh the foreign minister, and Abbas Mirza Salar-Lashgar the general. This was much to the embarrassment of British officials who had given them earlier guarantees of their security . After his release, Farman Farma's family relations with the British, whom they saw as supporting the coup, became very strained. However, he offered several gestures of political support and personal friendship towards Reza Khan. Perhaps uncomfortable that he had once served under Farman Farma's command, and certainly resentful of his wealth, Reza Khan did not reciprocate, and even confiscated some of his property. He also arrested in 1929 Farman Farma's powerful son Nosrat-ed-Dowleh, at the time minister of finance, and finally ordered his assassination in 1937 while on house arrest.Shahzdeh's Tree for the date of 1937. Farman Farmaian had by that time retired from politics, and married in 1927 and 1937 his seventh and eighth wives, Hamdam Khanum Talai and Batoul Khanum Chizar Doost.Shahzdeh's Tree, p. 185 and 197 He spent his final years under house arrest suffering from gout, arthritis, and insomnia. He died in 1939 and is buried in the Shrine of Shazdeh Abdol Azim. Historical anecdote Among the Cossacks accompanying Farman-Farma during the 1912 campaign to Kermanshah was an officer known as \\"Reza Maksim\\" because he was good at maneuvering a Maxim gun. This was none other than Reza Khan Mirpanj, who would become known as Sardar Sepah, and then as Reza Khan Pahlavi, the founder of the Pahlavi dynasty.The Lion of Persia, p. 120-121. Later Reza Khan, leader of the Cossacks brigade, became involved in a British operation and shortly afterwards in a British backed coup, to establish himself as the new Shah in 1921. The once friendly relationship between Farman-Farma and Reza Khan, who had once been his subordinate, became more tenuous as Reza rose in stature and power, first as minister of war and then as shah. Nevertheless, he continued to treat Farman- Farma respectfully until the end of his life.The Lion of Persia, p.194. Name and title His full official name and title was Hazrat Aghdas Vala Shahzadeh Abdol Hossein Mirza Farman Farma. This translates approximately as \\"His Highness, Prince Abdol Hossein, the Eminent and Exalted One, the Greatest of All Commanders.\\" When surnames became compulsory he took his last title as his family name, viz. Farman Farma, which literally translates as \\"giver of an order\\", and is roughly equivalent to \\"viceroy\\".The Lion of Persia, p.1 The title \\"Farman Farma\\" did not originate with Prince Abdol-Hossein Mirza Farman Farma. It was first held by his grand-uncle Farman Farma, a son of Fath-Ali Shah Qajar. Prince Abdol Hossein's father, Prince Firouz, would battle his own uncle, Prince Hossein Ali Farman Farma, in support his brother Prince Mohammad (later Mohammad Shah Qajar) and win the right to the succession for Prince Mohammad. Forty years later, Nasser-al-Din Shah, Firouz Mirza's nephew, would bestow the title Farman Farma on Prince Firouz in gratitude for his role in consolidating the succession to the Qajar (Kadjar) Throne. The title Farman Farma then passed on to his son Prince Abdol Hossein Mirza, during the reign of Nasser-ed-Din Shah. Nasser-ed-din Shah and Prince Abdol Hossein were cousins, but Nasser-ed-Din Shah was about thirty years his senior. Only Prince Abdol Hossein carried the title \\"Farman Farma\\", while most of his offspring carry the family name derived from the former title \\"Farman Farmaian\\" (lit. Those belonging to Farman Farma). His elder son Firouz Nosrat-ed-Dowleh III however chose the family name \\"Firouz\\", which is carried by his offspring. Non-Persian honors He was awarded the following honors outside of Persia: * Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (British) Offspring Contrary to many Persian politicians and royal household members at the time and due to the uncertain political climate, Farmanfarma felt that his sons and daughters should obtain modern European educations as opposed to classical Persian educations. He ensured that they worked particularly hard towards this goal throughout their lives. As a consequence the vast majority of his sons and daughters, after having obtained first class educations, went on to work in senior and key roles throughout the Iranian government from the turn of the century through to the 1970s.

The awards were established in 1988. From 1989 to 2003, a jury of journalists allotted \\"Golden Aces\\" by category to games presented by their editors. A special prize, the Super As d'Or, was allotted to the best game from any category. In 2003, the process was modified to give more autonomy to the jury. A single As d'Or was awarded, and 10 nominees were announced. In 2005, the award merged with the Jeu de l'Année. It was decided that the combined award should be named after the year of awarding rather than year of publication, so the first combined award was the 2005 As d'Or Jeu de l'Année with awards in three categories: general public/family games, experts, and children. In 2012, the As d'Or Prix du Jury was added.

They were again cup winners in 1935/36, when they beat LTSK 4-1, but were beaten in the final the following season by APOEL Nicosia, with the game ending 2-1. After a one-year break, Trust won the cup for the third time in 1938, when they beat AEL Limassol 2-1 in the final. Despite the cups, the club's win in the first league competition in 1935 was the only Championship trophy ever won by the team. Until 1938 the team was always in second position, under the shadow of APOEL, which was constantly champion in that period. In 1938 the first Cypriot Champions disbanded their football club, because of financial problems. The colours of the club were yellow and green. Their stadium was the old GSP Stadium.

The design and identity of the Tele-TV service was completed by 1996 - creative director Morgan Almeida and executive producer Peter Stonier had led global teams (English & Pockett, Pittard Sullivan Fitzgerald, PmCD ) to brand the service and design graphical user interfaces for interactive program guides. These pioneering interfaces won several patents and numerous major interactive awards. Michael Bavaro was the senior designer and director and developed the promotional Galaxy channel. However the project was impacted by technical challenges, increasing costs, and unanticipated market changes - primarily that the Internet took off faster than fiber-optic TV systems—and so the three Baby Bells shut the venture down.SALLIE HOFMEISTER. \\" Tele-TV Slashes Work Force.\\" Los Angeles Times, 5 April 1997 They found entering the long-distance market much more appealing than promoting interactive TV.

History The Wimbledon Cup is a silver tankard wrought by British silversmiths of the Victorian period. The National Rifle Association of the United Kingdom inaugurated the prize in 1866. The Illustrated London News reported on July 26, 1866, that the Wimbledon Cup was a new prize for the Wimbledon Rifle Meeting of that year. In 1875, the trophy was presented to the American rifle team attending the British matches at Wimbledon by Princess Louise, on behalf of the riflemen of Great Britain. Members of the American team competed among themselves for the trophy at Wimbledon; this match was won by Major Henry Fulton. The Wimbledon Cup was taken to the United States and placed in annual competition at Creedmoor Rifle Range as the trophy for a long range match open to any rifle.

Lowermost Cretaceous dinosaurs come from a bauxite mine in the Bihor County (northwest Romania) that has yielded thousands of disarticulated bones. Uppermost Cretaceous dinosaurs have been known from the Hațeg Basin (south Transylvania) since the end of the 19th century, mostly as bone concentrations (fossiliferous pockets); more recently, nests with dinosaur eggs, including hatchlings, have been found in Hațeg. Although separated by a gap of approximately 60 million years, the two dinosaur faunas from Romania share some common features: predominance of ornithopods, absence of large theropods (although the Maastrichtian Hațeg assemblage has several small theropods), and, in general, the small size of the individuals (see also insular dwarfism). Dinosaurs of Romania The discovery of dinosaur bones in a bauxite mine at Cornet-Brusturi, near Oradea (Bihor County) was made accidentally by two miners in 1978 during ore exploitation. Almost at the same time, research in the already known Uppermost Cretaceous dinosaur-bearing deposits from the Hațeg Basin were restarted by Dan Grigorescu, after an interruption of more than 60 years, since Franz Nopcsa’s work in the region. The Berriasian bauxite deposits at Cornet have yielded approximately 10,000 bones and bone fragments, mainly from ornithopod dinosaurs and rarer pterosaurs. The region was located to the east of the Piemont-Liguria Ocean, and during the Early Cretaceous formed an archipelago of coral and volcanic islands, not too dissimilar to today's Indonesia or the Caribbean. As the Apulian Plate moved northwest towards the end of the Cretaceous and the beginning of the uplift of the Alpide belt, the offshore Hațeg Island was formed at the rim of the shrinking Tethys Ocean. Among the species that lived here are: Zalmoxes, Telmatosaurus, Balaur, Rhabdodon, Magyarosaurus and Struthiosaurus. Other prehistoric creatures that lived among them, without being dinosaurs are: Allodaposuchus and Hatzegopteryx. References *Grigorescu, Dan.

These three brother divisions occasionally exchange content. In addition to publishing the magazine, LeveL also organizes many yearly gaming competitions for players in two of the countries (Romania's pro-gaming sponsor being the PGL - Professional Gamer's League); it is one of the biggest Turkish sponsors of international gaming contests (such as WCG). LeveL was founded by Jan \\"Beast\\" Tománek in 1995 in Czech Republic. Its first issue was released on 24.01.1995. The current LeveL editor-in-chief is Michal Křivský (replacing Petr Poláček). LEVEL in Czech republic LEVEL was the third magazine, after Excalibur in 1991 and Score in 1994, about computer games, released on the Czech market. With the founder Martin Ludvík, LEVEL began its history in January, 1995. For a year and a half, the editor-in-chief was Jan Tománek, followed by Petr Bulíř (half a year in charge) and Jan Herodes, who led the magazine for seven years. His former assistant Ondřej Průša, one of the few people who had been with LEVEL for its whole history, replaced him during the following 4 years. The current editor- in-chief is Martin Bach. LEVEL is considered the best selling magazine about computer games in the Czech republic with nearly 40.000 print-outs dispatched every month. Current editorial staff consists of more than twenty members. Level is/was structured into following sections and page donations: Editorial - word from chief editor Content table Letters - letter from fans with answers from editors Review of Month - 4 pages Reactor - about 13 papes of blogs/commentaries from editors/game developers and interesting themes News - 12 pages Previews - 4 pages Theme - 4 pages Pixelvision / page 42 - section with art from games developers, 2 pages Reviews - 19 pages Hardware - news, tests, performance comparisons, interesting HW, 14 pages Consoles - news, reviews, 4 pages Retro - news, happened before x years, making of..., geography, irreversible destiny, 10 pages Developers introduction - 4 pages Mod scene - 2 pages Advertisements through whole magazine - 17 pages From March 1998 every issue of magazine is accompanied by at least one AA/AAA fullgame on cover CD/DVD.

The content is usually carried on one or two one-sided DVD9 media. LEVEL in Turkey The Turkish edition was founded and initially written by M. Berker Güngör (alias \\"Maddog\\") in 1997 and then Sinan Akkol (alias \\"Blaxis\\") joined the family couple of years later when he attended to a contest and became the heart of LEVEL; today it is the leading computer games magazine in Turkey, with over 25 authors and distribution of 20 000 per issue. While the global games magazine PC Gamer and the local Gameshow (magazine) at first competed in the Turkish market, their Turkish branches closed due to financial difficulty, leaving LEVEL without competitors -- and with extra staff poached from the failed publications. The magazine encourages the purchase of legal copies of games, having published a series of articles about software piracy. During August 2007, The magazine was sold to Doğan Burda, the leading magazine publisher of Turkey. Fırat Akyıldız (the editor-in-chief for Official PlayStation 2 Magazine Turkey and GamePro magazines in the past) became the editor-in-chief. Famous comedy duo Cenk and Erdem, Cem Şancı and writer Ali Aksöz (the creator of a highly successful web organization named Lost Library) has returned to LEVEL after the split. Also many writers from GamePro has joined LEVEL.  LEVEL in Romania  In September 1997 Vogel Publishing Romania launches the first Romanian gaming magazine called \\"LEVEL INTERNATIONAL GAMES MAGAZINE\\". Today it is the leading computer games magazine in Romania with 21.000 magazines per issue and 79.000 readers per issue. LEVEL Romania saw its ups and downs in its over a decade of activity. The magazine includes a DVD since 2006, it was the second Romanian magazine to include a DVD, after XtremPC. The magazine also features a full game every issue since 2002, a very controversial decision back in the day because of the games' quality, which varied from issue to issue. The longest lasting author of LEVEL Romania is Marius Ghinea, who joined the team back in 1998 and raised the standards by writing high quality reviews, correlating gaming to forms of art and by having a very \\"refined taste\\" in games. Other authors that deserve to be mentioned for outstanding activity over the years: Mr. President, Claudiu 'Claude' Gedo, Wild Snake, Sebah, Mihail 'Mike' Stegaru, Mihai 'Mitza' Sfrijan, Sebastian 'Locke' Bularca, Vladimir 'Ciolan' Ciolan and Mircea 'KiMO' Dumitriu, current Editor in Chief. LEVEL Romania was in direct competition with PcGames4Fun, which got closed, and used to be in competition with GameOver (which featured only 16 issues), the latter being considered by many to be the best gaming magazine ever written in Romania so far. In 2007 LEVEL Romania organized an event called \\"Level-fest\\" aka \\"Viva la Level-ution\\", which would mark a successful re-tooling of their magazine. The event was held in Bucharest, in a club called \\"Fire\\". In 2008 LEVEL Romania held the contest \\"Tu faci jocurile\\" (You make the games) in which they awarded a team of programmers 5000 Euros for creating an original and entertaining video game (you could only enter the contest if you were an independent team, not part of a company). Starting with 2009, LEVEL has sometimes given 2 full games with certain issues and is also heavily promoting interesting Indie Games. As of December 2013, LEVEL no longer exists on the Romanian market. The old team made a new, online magazine called \\"NIVELUL2\\". In English, NIVELUL2 means LEVEL2, and the new magazine is known to be the spiritual successor to the former leading gaming magazine in the territory. Currently, NIVELUL2 is the leading online gaming publication in Romania.

Prior to the Reformation, Edinburgh was part of the Diocese of St Andrews, under the Archbishop of St Andrews and throughout the mediaeval period the episcopal seat was St Andrew's Cathedral. The line of Bishops of Edinburgh began with the creation of the See of Edinburgh in 1633: the See was founded in 1633 by King Charles I. William Forbes was consecrated at St. Giles' Cathedral as the first bishop on 23 January 1634 though he died later that year. The General Assembly of 1638 deposed David Lindsay and all the other bishops, so the next, George Wishart, was consecrated in 1662 after the Restoration. In 1690, it was Alexander Rose (bishop 1687–1720) whose unwelcome reply to King William III (and II) led to the disestablishment of the Scottish Episcopalians as Jacobite sympathisers, and it was he who led his congregation from St Giles' to a former wool store as their meeting house, on the site now occupied by Old Saint Paul's Church. After the break with the Church of Scotland in 1689, Bishops of Edinburgh were ex officio metropolitan bishops until this rank was abolished by a concordat of 1731. Since then, the Episcopal Church has been led by a Primus of the Scottish Episcopal Church elected from among any of the Scottish dioceses. After the repeal of the penal laws in 1792 and the reuniting of Episcopal and \\"Qualified\\" congregations, the diocese grew under the leadership of bishops Daniel Sandford, James Walker, C.H. Terrot and Henry Cotterill. The high point of the 19th century was the consecration of St Mary's Cathedral in 1879. The current bishop is John Armes.

Fukuchi wrote kabuki dramas in which Ichikawa Danjūrō IX and others starred; upon Danjūrō's death in 1903, Fukuchi retired from the management of the theater. The theater is now run by the Shochiku Corporation which took over in 1914. The original Kabuki-za was a wooden structure, built in 1889 on land which had been either the Tokyo residence of the Hosokawa clan of Kumamoto, or that of Matsudaira clan of Izu. http://kabuki21.com/kabukiza.php The building was destroyed on October 30, 1921, by an electrical fire. The reconstruction, which commenced in 1922, was designed to \\"be fireproof, yet carry traditional Japanese architectural styles\\", while using Western building materials and lighting equipment. Reconstruction had not been completed when it again burned down during the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake. Rebuilding was finally completed in 1924. The theater was destroyed once again by Allied bombing during World War II. It was restored in 1950 preserving the style of 1924 reconstruction, and was until recently one of Tokyo's more dramatic and traditional buildings. The 1950 structure was demolished in the spring of 2010, and rebuilt over the ensuing three years. Reasons cited for the reconstruction include concerns over the building's ability to survive earthquakes, as well as accessibility issues. A series of farewell performances, entitled were held from January through April 2010, after which kabuki performances took place at the nearby Shinbashi Enbujō and elsewhere until the opening of the new theatre complex, which took place on March 28, 2013.\\" Kabuki-za to be rebuilt from 2010.\\" Yomiuri Shimbun. 26 October 2008.

Architecture  Shops in basement Level 5 Roof garden The style in 1924 was in a baroque Japanese revivalist style, meant to evoke the architectural details of Japanese castles, as well as temples of pre-Edo period. This style was kept after the post-war reconstruction and again after the 2013 reconstruction. Inside, with the latest reconstruction the theatre was outfitted with four new front curtains called doncho. These are by renowned Japanese artists in the Nihonga style and reflect the different seasons. Performances Performances are exclusively run by Shochiku, in which the Kabuki-za Theatrical Corporation is the largest shareholder. They are nearly every day, and tickets are sold for individual acts as well as for each play in its entirety. As is the case for most kabuki venues, programs are organized monthly: each month there is a given set of plays and dances that make up the afternoon performance, and a different set comprising the evening show. These are repeated on a nearly daily schedule for three to four weeks, with the new month bringing a new program.

Sleipnir Mobile: The following mobile versions of Sleipnir for smartphones have been released: Android, iOS, Windows Phone Reception Early Gecko-based versions of Sleipnir for Windows scored positive reviews from CNET for the design and functionality, most noticeably, for the inclusion of gestures. “The action is very smooth and natural and a lot like scrolling through pages on your phone with your thumb.” The OSX version review by MakeUseOf followed generally the same line while additionally bringing attention to the convenient tab management. MacWorld, while reviewing Sleipnir 4 for Mac has praised how the URl bar was changed. “Opera pioneered that idea, but Sleipnir’s tabs remain constantly visible and strike a nice balance between being large enough to identify but small enough not to intrude on the main browser window.” Despite this, version 4 was criticized for its poor performance, compared to other browsers using WebKit. Later versions of Sleipnir received positive reviews from Softpedia, due to the browsers customizability, features and the availability of mobile versions. “Sleipnir proves to be a stable and fast web browser that comes with innovative functions and various customization possibilities. The extra security features, together with smartphone and web apps linking are features that make it a viable alternative to its more popular competitors.” In 2012 multiple performance tests by Tom's Hardware, the Android version of Sleipnir has been placed on the third spot as the best browser for Android, outrun by Dolphin and Maxthon.

He was born in Suva and completed a Bachelor of Arts degree and Post Graduate Certificate in Education from the University of the South Pacific. He has served for many years as General Secretary of the National Federation Party (NFP), and worked to revive the popularity of the party, once a major player on the political scene but left without parliamentary representation in the general elections of 1999, 2001, and 2006. Rae was an unsuccessful candidate for the Suva City Open Constituency in the 1999 election. He received only 89 votes out of more than 12,000. He made another attempt to win election to the House of Representatives in the 2001 election, this time from the Laucala Open Constituency. He polled 6.1 percent of the vote, a considerable improvement on the negligible showing that Jag Nadan had made in the 1999 election. He was also a candidate in the 2006 election. He polled 666 votes, some 5 percent of the total, in the Samabula Tamavua Open Constituency. Most of his opponents in 2006 were nationally known politicians. Rae strongly opposed the military coup that deposed the elected government of Laisenia Qarase on 5 December 2006. In the general elections held in 2014, the first since the coup, Rae stood as a candidate for the NFP, but was not elected.  Trade unionist  Rae has also been General Secretary of the Bank and Financial Sector Employees Union since March 2004, when he defeated Fiji Labour Party Parliamentarian Ganesh Chand by 1145 votes to 484, with 17 ballots invalidated, in the trade union leadership elections. Alleging irregularities and corruption, Chand claimed that the election had been \\"thoroughly rigged\\" and sought an injunction in the High Court to nullify the election. The court upheld Chand's complaint and referred the matter to Taito Waqa, the Chief Executive Officer of the Ministry of Labour, who is also the Registrar of Trade Unions, for a final decision. Waqa ruled in favour of Chand on 10 February 2006. Chand said that Rae must vacate the union offices immediately and surrender any union assets in his custody, the Fiji Times reported. Rae responded on 14 February that Waqa's decision had been made in error. He had written to the Registrar, he said, to correct the mistake, and would remain in office pending a reply. Union President Salesh Naidu told Fiji Village on 2 March that the union was seeking a judicial review of the decision to remove Rae. On 10 March, the High Court granted a stay order, allowing Rae to remain in office pending the outcome of the judicial review.

They are the daughters of Cinderella's wicked stepmother, who treat her poorly. The \\"ugly sisters\\" have been in variations of the story from as early as researchers have been able to determine.Graham Anderson, Fairytale in the ancient world (Routledge, 2000), 41.  Early depictions  In the ancient Chinese story of Ye Xian, the \\"ugly sister\\" character is the titular character's half-sister and is named Jun-li. In contrast to the beautiful and talented Ye Xian, Jun-li is unattractive and too lazy to learn any particular skills. Jun-li and her mother, Jin, maltreat Ye Xian, forcing her to clean the cave in which they reside. Jun-li and her mother also put an end to Ye Xian's newfound happiness after they discover that Ye Xian's late mother has reincarnated in the form of a ten foot long golden carp, which grants her wishes. Jun-li and her mother slay and eat the fish, not knowing that Ye Xian has salvaged the creature's bones and buried them beneath her bed, and once again her wishes are granted. After Ye Xian loses a golden slipper at the local festival, the warlord who discovers it visits the family cave, declaring he will marry the woman whose foot fits the slipper. Jun-li and her mother fail to get their feet into the slipper, but Ye Xian succeeds and dons the finery she wore at the festival. Outraged at their cruelty toward her, the warlord exiles Jun-li and her mother to the wilderness, where they are killed by a rain of flying stones. In Charles Perrault's original fairytale, the sisters were Cinderella's stepsisters, and are described as \\"proud and haughty\\" rather than ugly, though Cinderella is described as being \\"far lovelier than her sisters, though they were always dressed fashionably.\\" The unnamed younger stepsister is described as being not as rude or spiteful as the elder, who is named Charlotte (Javotte in French).\\"Once there was a gentleman who married, for his second wife, the proudest and most haughty woman that was ever seen. She had, by a former husband, two daughters of her own, who were, indeed, exactly like her in all things.\\" ... \\"Only the younger sister, who was not so rude and uncivil as the older one, called her Cinderella.\\" In Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm's version entitled Aschenputtel the unnamed stepsisters are described as having, \\"beautiful faces and fair skin, but hearts that were foul and black\\", and are portrayed in a much more malicious light than Perrault's version. In Perrault's version of the tale, the stepsisters are forgiven for their cruelty and Cinderella invites them to the palace to live with her, and she marries each of them to a wealthy lord. In the Grimms' considerably much darker version of the tale, the wicked stepmother and the stepsisters are actually just dirty traitors versus the crown. Indeed, under their mother's pression, the stepsisters attempt to trick the prince by cutting off their heels and toes in order to make the golden slipper fit their foot, but the prince spots the blood on their stockings thanks to Aschenputtel's magic doves, her minions, and realises they are imposters. Once Aschenputtel is recognised by the prince, the stepsisters try to profit by getting rich and invite themselves to Aschenputtel's royal wedding, where their princess takes her awful revenge summoning the pigeons and doves to attack the stepsisters' faces, mutilating their beauty and tearing their eyes out, sentencing them to a lifetime of blindness as punishment for their diabolical behaviour. In the opera La Cenerentola (1817) by Gioachino Rossini and Jacopo Ferretti, the sisters are named Clorinda and Tisbe.  In pantomime  Traditionally, the two stepsisters are played by men (although in some adaptions, they are played by women, whereas in others they are played by a man and a woman) and their attire is outrageous and garish, parodying the latest fashions. A favorite gag is to have one sister tall and thin, the other short and fat, only for them to state that they are \\"identical twins.\\" They are portrayed as unruly man-eaters who provide much of the story's comic relief, flirting with men in the audience and repeatedly insulting each other yet teaming up to torment Cinderella. The sisters are extremely jealous of Cinderella, as she is very beautiful and they are very ugly. In order to ensure no man will want to marry her, they reduce her to their maidservant and force her into waiting on them non-stop and doing all the dirtiest kitchen jobs. Sometimes Cinderella has an alternate name, such as \\"Isabella\\", \\"Ella\\", Arabella\\", or more recently, \\"Heidi\\", and the jealous stepsisters rename her \\"Cinderella\\" due to the fact she mostly sweeps and cleans the firesides and is constantly covered in ashes and cinders. When Buttons, the Baron's footman delivers the news of the Royal Ball, the stepsisters plot to claim the prince as their own. When they realise Cinderella has also been invited, they force her, or trick her, into tearing up her ticket. They then strut off to the Ball and are amazed and horrified when Cinderella appears with the help of her fairy godmother. The Ball is often used as a comical scene in which the sisters humiliate themselves in an attempt to charm the prince, who is too enchanted with Cinderella to notice them. Then Cinderella flees at midnight, leaving one of her glass or crystal or silver slippers behind. The next day, the Prince arrives with the news he will marry whomsoever the slipper fits. The two sisters fight and quarrel over who the shoe will fit. It is traditional to have one sister concealing a false leg beneath her skirt in an attempt to fool the prince. Another tradition is that one sister has yards and yards of multicoloured stockings beneath her skirt, which must be comically removed before trying the shoe on. When the shoe does not fit, the Prince allows Cinderella (who has either been tricked into leaving the house or locked in the cellar) to try it on. When the shoe fits, the stepsisters are horrified. Their fates are dependent upon which version is being told. Sometimes they are forgiven for their cruelty, other times they are demoted to servants in the prince's castle, or sometimes the Baron Hardup at last puts his foot down and stands up to them. In more recent adaptations, the role of the wicked stepmother has been reduced in prominence and the sisters assume her role to a degree. Sometimes she has died or other times she has absconded with the family fortune and left Cinderella to cope with her two ugly daughters. Unlike many characters in the pantomime, the stepsisters' names are not set. After Rossini's opera, for many years they were named Clorinda and Thisbe, now these names have fallen out of use and their names have changed to suit the fashions of the times. Often they are named after flowers, illnesses or celebrities. Notable ugly sisters have been played by Terry Scott and Julian Orchard (Theresa and Julia), Brian Murphy and Yootha Joyce (Georgina and Mildred after their sitcom characters George and Mildred), real life sisters, Elsie and Doris Waters (Gert and Daisy after their radio sitcom characters), Brian Murphy and Roy Hudd (Amnesia and Magnesia), and Paul Merton and Ronnie Corbett (Lucretia and Griselda).  Disney depictions  Unlike the Grimms' version of the fairy tale \\"where the sisters were themselves 'beautiful and fair in appearance,'\\" Disney's depiction presents Drizella and Anastasia as ugly sisters.Douglas Brode, Multiculturalism and the Mouse: race and sex in Disney entertainment (University of Texas Press, 2005), 184. Southwest Texas State University's Department of English identifies various distinguishing characteristics of Drizella and Anastasia, such as exaggerated and naked feet emphasizing physical nature and a big bustle emphasizing clumsiness, of these characters versus their more positively presented counterpart, Cinderella.Southwest Texas State University. Dept. of English, Studies in American humor 1 (1994): 66, 69. Disney describes them as simply \\"spoiled, awkward, and ungainly.\\"  Shrek depictions  Doris and Mabel are ugly sisters in the films Shrek 2 and Shrek the Third. Both are voiced by men (Larry King voiced Doris and Regis Philbin voiced Mabel) and covered in lavish and poor applications of makeup, not unlike their usual portrayals in pantomime. Mabel is a villain who sides with the evil Prince Charming's conquest of the kingdom of Far Far Away. Doris, in contrast, seems to be on friendly terms with the protagonists (including her stepsister Cinderella). Doris and Mabel reconcile in the end upon Artie convincing the villains to not be villains after they were defeated by their respective opponents.  Once Upon a Time depictions  In ABC's Once Upon a Time, there a total of five known versions of the stepsisters. In the first Storybook, the stepsisters are named Clorinda and Tisbe, portrayed by Mekenna Melvin and Goldie Hoffman. They are based on the stepsisters from the Charles Perrault version of the fairytale, the operatic version, and the Disney version. However, another version of the stepsister from the Disney film, Anastasia, is not related to Cinderella and instead has a separate stepsister with a storyline that parallels Cinderella's. This version of the character is a primary antagonist of the spin-off series, Once Upon a Time in Wonderland, and is portrayed by Emma Rigby. In the second Storybook, the stepsisters retain their Disney names of Anastasia and Drizella, portrayed by Yael Yurman and Adelaide Kane. Drizella is the main antagonist of the first half of the seventh season, while Anastasia dies prior to the start of the season, only to be revived. Both were members, though at different times, of the Coven of the Eight, a group of witches. They both eventually leave the Coven and reconcile, returning to the alternate Enchanted Forest.  Criticism  Jasper Fforde in the novel The Big Over Easy presents a (notional) claim for damages from publishers over what is termed the persistent defamation of Ella's step- sisters. \\"A spokesman for the sisters explained: 'My clients are fed up with being constantly portrayed as physically repellent obnoxious harpies, and have decided to take action against the 984 publishers that have repeated the allegations without bothering to check their veracity'\\".Jasper Fforde, The Big Over Easy (2005) p. 223  References  Category:Cinderella characters Category:Fairy tale stock characters Category:Female characters in fairy tales Category:Female characters in film Category:Female characters in television Category:Fictional bullies Category:Fictional characters without a name Category:Fictional families Category:Fictional nobility Category:Pantomime Category:Literary duos Category:Female literary villains Category:Once Upon a Time (TV series) characters ","title":"Ugly sisters"},{"id":"3606102","title":"Iberian languages"},{"id":"3606105","title":"1818 United Kingdom general election"},{"id":"3606109","text":"St. David's School is an independent school located on Woodcote Valley Road, Purley, London, serving pupils age 3–11 years.

Common names Other common names for C. mouhotii include keel-backed terrapin, jagged- shelled turtle, and Mouhot's turtle. Etymology The specific name, mouhotii, is in honor of Alexandre Henri Mouhot, a French naturalist and explorer.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Cuora mouhotii, p. 183; C. m. obsti, p. 193). The subspecific name, obsti, is in honor of Fritz Jürgen Obst (1939–2018), a German herpetologist. Taxonomy C. mouhotii is sometimes treated as the sole species of the monotypic genus Pyxidea.Pyxidea mouhotii. Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS).Zhang L, et al. (2008). \\"The complete mitochondrial genome of the keeled box turtle Pyxidea mouhotii and phylogenetic analysis of major turtle groups\\". Journal of Genetics and Genomics 35 (1): 33–40. Phylogenetic analysis using mitochondrial DNA has provided evidence that the species is part of the \\"Cuora group\\", a monophyletic group of Asian box turtles, and the name Pyxidea should probably be synonymized with Cuora, making the keeled box turtle part of that genus.Honda M, et al. (2002). \\"Phylogenetic relationships of the Asian box turtles of the genus Cuora sensu lato (Reptilia: Bataguridae) inferred from mitochondrial DNA sequences\\". Zoological Science 19: 1305-1312.

Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 31 (1): 164–777. In addition, its morphology is not distinct enough from that of Cuora species to keep it separate, and it is known to hybridize with Cuora galbinifrons. Subspecies There are two subspecies which are recognized as being valid.Fritz U, et al. (1998). \\"Eine neue Unterart der Dreikiel- Scharnierschildkröte, Pyxidea mouhotii (Gray, 1862) \\". Zool. Abh. Mus. Tierkd. Dresden 50: 33-43. (in German, with an abstract in English). *Cuora mouhotii mouhotii *Cuora mouhotii obsti Nota bene: A trinomial authority in parentheses indicates that the subspecies was originally described in a genus other than Cuora. Hybridization The southern Vietnamese population of Cuora mouhotii lives alongside Cuora picturata. Since Cuora mouhotii is known to hybridize with the closest living relatives of Cuora picturata (Cuora galbinifrons and Cuora bourreti ) there is a possibility of hybridization in the wild between these two populations.Ly, Tri; Huy Duc Hoang; Stewart, Bryan L. (2013). \\"Occurrence of the endangered keeled box turtle, Cuora mouhotii, in Southern Vietnam.\\" bioone.org. N.p., n.d. Web. 23 Oct. 2013. . Description The keeled box turtle's upper shell (carapace) has three large, raised ridges and is serrated on the back end. The lower shell (plastron) is different variations of brown in color, ranging from light brown to dark brown. The upper jaw is strong, while the snout is short and curved. The feet are only partially webbed, which suggest a terrestrial lifestyle as opposed to an aquatic one. Male and female keeled box turtles can be distinguished by the color of their eyes as well as their nails. A male generally has longer and thicker nails than a female, and eyes that are either black or brown. A female generally has shorter, thinner nails, and eyes that are orange or red.\\"Keeled box turtle (Cuora mouhotii )\\". Keeled box turtle videos, photos and facts. N.p., n.d. Web. 25 Oct. 2013. .\\" Biology The biology of C. mouhotii is not well known.Ji-Chao W, et al. (2011). \\"Reproduction and nesting of the endangered keeled box turtle (Cuora mouhotii) on Hainan Island, China\\". Chelonian Conservation and Biology 10 (2): 159–164. In one survey, males and females had an average straight carapace length around . The breeding season is in May through September. The average clutch size was four eggs, which are smooth, white, and about long. On average they typically lay two clutches in a breeding season. Like many other turtles the keeled box turtle does not care for its young. Females have been noted to dig nests with their rear legs and cover the clutches with soil, and also to lay eggs under fallen leaves. The male keeled box turtle is very aggressive during the act of mating. In some instances the male turtle will chase and injure a female. The male will often persist until the female allows its advances. Diet The keeled box turtle is herbivorous, and eats a wide variety of vegetation in the natural environment, with a preference for wild fallen fruits. It will also occasionally eat worms, snails, and other meat. Habitat The keeled box turtle is a terrestrial species, and can be frequently found in small caves and rock crevices. It can also be found in forests, in deep layers of leaves. Conservation status C. mouhotii is listed as an endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The population of the keeled box turtle has been on a steep decline in some areas, particularly Vietnam. This can be attributed to people capturing it for food and pets, as well as Vietnam legally exporting large numbers. Although there are other possible reasons behind this population decline, deforestation and hunting have proven to be a major threat to this turtle especially. Threats include habitat destruction and degradation during deforestation. In parts of its range it is threatened by overexploitation as it is collected from the wild, especially for food.Inclusion of Pyxidea mouhotii in Appendix II in accordance with Article II 2(a) of the Convention, and satisfying Resolution Conf. 9.24, Annex 2a, Criteria A and Bi).

He has produced tracks for other artists, such as Funkoars and Kate Miller-Heidke, in addition to his work with the Hilltop Hoods. Lambert has been an active artist for over 15 years since the release of the debut Hilltop Hoods album. Early life Lambert was born on 6 May 1977 in Adelaide, South Australia. He grew up there and states in the lyrics of the Hilltop Hoods song \\"The Hard Road\\" that he left high school without graduating and was subsequently employed as a \\"factory labourer\\". Music career Suffa met bandmate MC Pressure at Blackwood High School in the early 1990s and formed the Hilltop Hoods. After a demo and two releases, the band had a breakthrough album with The Calling in 2003. Suffa's first solo production was a compilation album, entitled Suffering City Vol. 1, and was released in 2002—the album featured tracks such as \\"Divine Intervention Part 3\\", \\"True Aussie Icon\\" and \\"Lifes Geographics\\", whereby a series of artists performed over Suffa's musical creations. Artists such as Muphin, Pegasus, DJ Bonez and Reason contributed to Suffering City Vol. 1. In an interview prior to the launch of the album, Suffa provided a description of the album: > Because of the diverse range of artists I couldn’t say there was a > particular flavour to the album. Perhaps the only continuity people will > find on the album is the beats. As far as the content goes I’d have to say > that it’s an album that Australian listeners can appreciate. You won’t find > tracks on the album geared at trying to entice a US or European market. In 2002, following his work on Suffering City Vol. 1, Suffa also revealed a perspective on hip hop production that he had discovered at that time of his career: \\"I think the key to hip hop production is keeping things rough. If a song’s too clean it loses its edge. My advice to producers is to look outside the standard jazz, funk and soul breaks for samples. I’ll sample anything, even if someone else has already used it. I’ve stopped caring about 'The rules'.\\" Following the release of the Hilltop Hoods' sixth album, Drinking from the Sun, a free EP, entitled The Good Life in the Sun, was released as a free download in mid-2012. The entire EP was produced by Suffa and featured remixes of songs from the sixth album, such as \\"Speaking in Tongues\\" and \\"The Underground\\". The EP also features a song that is a collaborative effort by Australian artists Plutonic Lab, One Above and Hilltop Hoods' DJ Debris. In collaboration with Suffa, Western Australian MC Drapht released a song, entitled \\"Salute\\", on 20 February 2013 and it was uploaded to the MC's SoundCloud profile. Drapht also appears on the Hilltop Hoods' seventh studio album Walking Under Stars, providing a verse for the track \\"Brainbox\\". Hilltop Hoods released \\"Walking Under Stars\\" on 8 August 2014 and, while the album is a Golden Era Records recording, Universal Music Australia acquired the exclusive licensing rights to distribute the album in Australia, Canada, Austria, Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Benelux, while Golden Era continues its partnership with Fontana for the US release. Walking Under Stars was conceived before Drinking From the Sun was written and Lambert referred to the former as \\"a companion piece\\" in an August 2014 interview. Lambert also explained that \\"I’m a Ghost\\" is four-years-old, while a segment of \\"Brainbox\\" originally appeared on the 2012 Golden Era mixtape. After signing with Golden Era in early 2013, Adelaide MC K21 published the first single from his second album online in October 2014. Suffa was responsible for the production of the single, entitled \\"Change My Way\\" and features Joy Sparkes. Media appearances In 2006, Suffa appeared on the ABC quiz show Spicks and Specks. Suffa appeared with radio presenter Scott Dooley, a former host of the afternoon show of the national Australian youth radio station Triple J, in a 2009 video segment filmed in the Australian town of Sale, Victoria. Causes In 2007, Suffa collaborated with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) to promote a campaign targeting the animal welfare practices of farms which supply chicken meat to the American fast food chain, Kentucky Fried Chicken. In a press release for the campaign, Suffa was clear about his position and perspective on the subject: > The chickens who end up in KFC buckets are crammed into windowless sheds > with tens of thousands of other chickens and made to live in their own > feces. They have the ends of their beaks sliced off without painkillers when > they're still babies and are bred to grow so big, so fast, that their legs > often snap under the weight of their bloated bodies. The sickest thing of > all is that a lot of times chickens are still fully conscious when their > throats are cut or when they're dunked into tanks of scalding hot water to > remove their feathers. If KFC execs treated cats or dogs the way their > suppliers treat chickens, they could be charged with crimes. Other activities At the launch of the Australian Government's National Office for Live Music in July 2013, Lambert was announced as the state ambassador for South Australia. Arts Minister Tony Burke said the office would \\"partner with governments, local councils, communities, businesses, musicians and songwriters\\" and \\"identify key policy, regulatory and process reforms to better support a robust local live music scene.\\" Lambert was reported as saying that a strong live music scene is essential given a decline in digital sales. Perspectives In addition to the lyrical content of his MC work with the Hilltop Hoods, Suffa has also been considerably vocal in interviews in regard to his views on hip hop subjects, as well as broader issues. During the promotional period for Drinking From The Sun, Suffa conveyed his opinion on the growth of Australian indigenous hip hop, a particularly relevant issue for the artist due to his support of Trials (of the Funkoars) and Briggs, both Australian Aboriginal MCs who are on the Golden Era Records roster (the record label founded and owned by the Hilltop Hoods): > I don't want to take away from artists like Briggs and Trials and Brother > Black by saying it's \\"Aboriginal hip hop\\"s time ... They've all got there on > their artistic merits. You have to ask: \\"Is the audience ready for it?\\" I > would say \\"definitely yes.\\" I've seen the influence Briggs has on Aboriginal > kids, and Trials; they're going to spur a whole generation of DJs and > producers. Also in 2012, Suffa commented on the place of competition in Australian hip hop: > I never like to see music as a competition, it's not a healthy way to be > creatively, it's an unhealthy mindset. You should be making music for > yourself; other influences shouldn't come into it. There are some subtle > rivalries but nothing like the States, there’s no violence, no real beef. > The kids here wouldn't know about real beef. And, I'm glad for that. In an August 2014 promotional interview for Walking Under Stars, Lambert stated that the band's musical horizons had broadened over the course of their career and they \\"laugh now at how narrow-minded we were when we were kids\\": > When we were 18-year-old kids, there were only certain kinds of music, even > hip hop, that we would listen to. The older you get, the more your horizons > expand ... I think there’s a domino effect. You listen to one artist you > like and then you keep digging from there. Lambert concluded the interview by mentioning how grateful he is for his life situation: \\"When you wake up to Israel, Palestine, Syria, Iraq, Isis, Ukraine, all that shit—in the morning, it’s like \\"Jesus Christ!\\" I have a lovely house and I make music for a living ... Two fingers to everyone complaining about their first-world problems. We have it good, we have it lucky.\\" Personal life The Adelaide newspaper The Advertiser spoke with Lambert in April 2012 and he revealed that he had proposed to his partner Carlie: > I've been planning on proposing to my partner Carlie for a while now, but it > was on our recent trip to the States that I finally picked up an engagement > ring from Tiffany's in New York ... On the weekend I took her down the coast > to where we first got together and proposed to her. We couldn't be happier. In May 2012, whilst presenting an edition of the Australian hip hop show on Triple J (normally hosted by Hau Latukefu of Australian hip hop duo Koolism), Lambert confirmed that he was engaged. Following the release of the \\"Cosby Sweater\\" single—from the seventh Hilltop Hoods studio album Walking Under Stars—Lambert revealed that he owns a collection of Coogi sweaters, made famous by hip hop artists such as Biggie Smalls and Snoop Dogg. Lambert said that his wife does not approve of the aesthetic of the sweater, but he said that he explains to her: \\"You have no idea how comfortable I am right now.\\" In July 2016, Lambert welcomed the arrival of his first child, a daughter.

In kombu in kerala the leading artist is sree chengamanad appu nair (pallavur appumarar award winner) Usage It is one of the few instrumental temple art forms in which the melody instruments dominate. Even this is only partly true, as the C-shaped trumpet, the kombu is regarded as a rhythm instrument by its players, with the function of embellishing the beats of the drums. The kombu can only produce three notes (sa, pa, and higher sa). The genre is played by a group of kombu players (3, 5, 7, or 9), led by the kombu leader. Within a given tala (rhythmic cycle), the leader improvises kombu patterns on the spot to be repeated by the chorus players. Kumath Raman Nair (2001), the most famous solo kombu artist from Trichur, states that kombu pattu can be played in six talams (beats in brackets): chempata (8), atanta (14), dhruvam (14), chempha (10), anchatantha (16), and thriputa (7). Each cycle is accented with the accompanying ilatalam cymbals. For instance, thriputa talam is played x . x . . x . x . x . x . . (broken down to 14 pulses for diagrammatic presentation), and chempata x . x . x . u . (represented as eight pulses; 'u' indicates a silent beat). Like the other kshetram genres, kombu pattu is played in a steadily increasing tempo with decreasing rhythm units.

While there are other species of gecko available under the same common name, the Cosymbotus platyurus is easily identified by the flaps of skin along its sides, making them resemble a miniature flying gecko (genus Ptychozoon). They are easily maintained in a terrarium with frequent misting and insect prey, but they are not easy to handle. Also, herpetoculturists often use this species in addition to anoles as a feeder lizard for some species of snakes, especially Asian green vine snakes (Ahaetulla prasina).

Gandhi.org. Retrieved 15 August 2020.) was a Gandhian and freedom fighter of India. She is also remembered for organizing the Congress Radio, also called the Secret Congress Radio, an underground radio station, which functioned for few months during the Quit India Movement of 1942. In 1998, the Government of India conferred on her Padma Vibhushan, the second highest civilian award of Republic of India. Early life Usha was born in Saras village near Surat in Gujarat. When she was just five years old, Usha first saw Gandhi while on a visit to his ashram at Ahmedabad. Shortly afterwards, Gandhi arranged a camp near her village in which little Usha participated, attending sessions and doing a little spinning. In 1928, eight-year-old Usha participated in a protest march against the Simon Commission and shouted her first words of protest against the British Raj: \\"Simon Go Back.\\" She and other children participated in early morning protests against the British Raj and picketing in front of liquor shops. During one of these protests marches, the policemen charged the children, and a girl carrying the Indian flag fell down along with the flag. Angry at this incident, the children took the story to their parents. The elders responded by dressing up the children in the colours of the Indian flag (saffron, white and green) and sending them out in the streets a few days later. Dressed in the colours of the flag, the children marched again, shouting: \\"Policemen, you can wield your sticks and your batons, but you cannot bring down our flag.\\" Usha's father was a judge under the British Raj. He therefore did not encourage her to participate in the freedom struggle. However, this limitation was removed when her father retired in 1930. In 1932, when Usha was 12, her family moved to Bombay, making it possible for her to participate more actively in the freedom movement. She and other children distributed clandestine bulletins and publications, visited relatives in the prisons, and carried messages to these prisoners. Usha grew up highly influenced by Gandhi and became one of his followers. She made an early decision to remain celibate for life and took up a spartan, Gandhian lifestyle, wearing only Khādī clothes and keeping away from luxuries of all types. Over time, she emerged as a prominent proponent of Gandhian thought and philosophy. Usha's initial schooling was in Kheda and Bharuch and then in Chandaramji High School, Bombay. She was an average student. In 1935, her matriculation examinations placed her among the top 25 students in her class. She continued her education at Wilson College, Bombay, graduating in 1939 with a first-class degree in philosophy. She also began studying law, but ended her studies in 1942 to join the Quit India Movement. Thereafter, beginning at age 22, she participated in the freedom movement full-time. Role in freedom movement Gandhi and the Congress had announced that the Quit India Movement would commence on 9 August 1942 with a rally at Gowalia Tank grounds in Mumbai. Nearly all leaders including Gandhi were arrested before that date. However, a vast crowd of Indians gathered at Gowalia Tank Ground on the appointed day. It was left to a group of junior leaders and workers to address them and hoist the national flag. On 14 August 1942, Usha and some of her close associates began the Secret Congress Radio, a clandestine radio station. It went air on 27 August. The first words broadcast in her voice were: \\"This is the Congress radio calling on [a wavelength of] 42.34 meters from somewhere in India.\\" Her associates included Vithalbhai Jhaveri, Chandrakant Jhaveri, Babubhai Thakkar and Nanka Motwani, owner of Chicago Radio, who supplied equipment and provided technicians. Many other leaders, including Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia, Achyutrao Patwardhan and Purushottam Trikamdas, also assisted the Secret Congress Radio. The radio broadcast recorded messages from Gandhi and other prominent leaders across India. To elude the authorities, the organizers moved the station's location almost daily. Ultimately, however, the police found them on 12 November 1942 and arrested the organizers, including Usha Mehta. All were later imprisoned. The Criminal Investigation Department (CID), a wing of the Indian Police, interrogated her for six months. During this time, she was held in solitary confinement and offered inducements such as the opportunity to study abroad if she would betray the movement. However, she chose to remain silent and, during her trials, asked the Judge of the High Court whether she was required to answer the questions. When the judge confirmed that she was not mandatory, she declared that she would not reply to any of the questions, not even to save herself. After the trial, she was sentenced to four years' imprisonment (1942 to 1946). Two of her associates were also convicted. Usha was imprisoned at Yeravda Jail in Pune. Her health deteriorated and she was sent to Bombay for treatment at Sir J. J. Hospital. In the hospital, three to four policemen kept a round-the-clock watch on her to prevent her from escaping. When her health improved, she was returned to Yeravda Jail. In March 1946, she was released, the first political prisoner to be released in Bombay, at the orders of Morarji Desai, who was at that time the home minister in the interim government. Although the Secret Congress Radio functioned only for three months, it greatly assisted the movement by disseminating uncensored news and other information banned by the British- controlled government of India. Secret Congress Radio also kept the leaders of the freedom movement in touch with the public. Reminiscing about those days, Usha Mehta described her involvement with the Secret Congress Radio as her \\"finest moment\\" and also as her saddest moment, because an Indian technician had betrayed them to the authorities. Post-independence After her incarceration, Usha's failing health prevented her from participating in politics or social work. The day India gained independence, Usha Mehta was confined to bed and could not attend the official function in New Delhi. She later re-commenced her education and wrote a doctoral dissertation on the political and social thought of Gandhi, earning a PhD from the University of Bombay. She had a long association with Mumbai university in many capacities: as a student, as a research assistant, as a lecturer, a professor, and finally as the head of the department of civics and politics. She retired from the University of Bombay in 1980. Even after India's independence, Usha continued to be socially active, particularly in spreading the Gandhian thought and philosophy. Over the years. she authored many articles, essays, and books in English and Gujarati, her mother tongue. She was elected the president of Gandhi Smarak Nidhi, a trust dedicated to the preservation of Gandhian heritage. The Nidhi acquired Mani Bhavan in Mumbai, residence of Sardar Patel's daughter Manibehn Patel, where Gandhi used to reside during his visits to the city and converted it into a Gandhi memorial. She was the president of Gandhi Peace Foundation, New Delhi. She also actively participated in the affairs of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan. The Government of India associated her with a number of celebrations of India's 50th anniversary of freedom. The Union of India conferred on her Padma Vibhushan in 1998,Padma Awards Directory (1954-2013), Ministry of Home Affairs (Public Section), Government of India, 14 August 2013.The fiery Indian student who ran a secret radio station for independence, BBC News, 15 August 2020. the second highest civilian award of India. Later years With time, Usha grew increasingly unhappy with the developments taking place in the social, political, and economic spheres of independent India. Once, in an interview to India Today, she expressed her feelings in these words: \\"Certainly this is not the freedom we fought for.\\" She added that the freedom fighters of her generation felt that \\"once people were ensconced in positions of power, the rot would set in.\\" However, in her words, \\"we didn’t know the rot would sink in so soon.\\" Nevertheless, she did not deny the achievements of free India since the independence: \\"India has survived as a democracy and even built a good industrial base,\\" she said. \\"Still, it is not the India of our dreams\\". In August 2000, although she was suffering from fever, Usha participated like she did every year in the anniversary celebrations related to the Quit India Movement in August Kranti Maidan. She returned home weak and exhausted. Two days later, she died peacefully on 11 August 2000 at the age of 80, survived by her elder brother and three nephews. One of her nephews, Ketan Mehta, a noted Bollywood filmmaker.

In May 1536, Brereton, the queen's brother George Boleyn, 2nd Viscount Rochford, Sir Henry Norris, Sir Francis Weston and a musician, Mark Smeaton, were tried and executed for treason and adultery with Anne Boleyn, the king's second wife. Many historians are now of the opinion that Anne Boleyn, Brereton and their co-accused were innocent. Family William Brereton, born between 1487 and 1490, was the seventh son of Sir Randle Brereton of Ipstones, Shocklach, and Malpas, Knight Chamberlain of Chester, knight banneret and knight of the body of Henry VII. His mother was Eleanor, daughter of Piers Dutton of Halton, Cheshire. Along with three of his brothers, including Sir Urian Brereton, William entered royal service. By 1521 he was a groom of the king's chamber, and from 1524, groom of the privy chamber. Marriage and issue In 1529, Brereton married Elizabeth, daughter of Charles Somerset, 1st Earl of Worcester, widow of Sir John Savage, and second cousin to Henry VIII. He and Elizabeth had two sons: * Henry Brereton * Thomas Brereton Elizabeth's first husband was the grandson of Sir John Savage, who had been a Lancastrian commander at the battle of Bosworth in 1485. When the grandson had fallen into debt, and was also being held in the Tower for murder, all his lands were forfeited to the crown, and Brereton, as the king's man in Cheshire, was granted jurisdiction over them. After Sir John Savage's death, Brereton's marriage to his widow established a family relationship with the king and thus cemented his position as a royal servant. In reward for his work for the king, Brereton received a number of royal grants in Cheshire and the Welsh Marches. These eventually brought him more than £10,000 a year. However, he wielded power ruthlessly, on one occasion, engineering the judicial murder of John ap Gryffith Eyton, whom he blamed for instigating the killing of one of his own retainers. Arrest, trial and execution In May 1536, Anne Boleyn was accused of adultery with Mark Smeaton, a musician of the royal household, and the courtiers Henry Norris, Sir Francis Weston, William Brereton as well as her brother, George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford, all of the privy chamber. The king's chief minister, Thomas Cromwell, \\"authorised and commissioned by the king,\\" masterminded the proceedings against the queen and her co-accused. The allegation against Brereton, who had been arrested on 4 May, was that Anne solicited him on 16 November 1533, and misconduct took place on 27 November. Historian Eric Ives argues that Cromwell added Brereton to the plot against Anne to end the troubles he was causing in the Welsh Marches, and to reorganise (and centralise) the local government of this area. The trials of William Brereton, Henry Norris, Sir Francis Weston, and Mark Smeaton took place at Westminster Hall on 12 May. They were charged with high treason against the king, adultery with the queen and plotting the king's death. Having been found guilty, they were all sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered(The sentence later reduced to beheading). The queen and her brother were tried separately on 15 May within the Tower. On 17 May, William Brereton, George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford, Henry Norris, Sir Francis Weston and Mark Smeaton, were led from the Tower to a scaffold on Tower Hill. George Constantyne, an eyewitness to their executions, recorded their last words. Brereton's words as he faced the executioner's axe, \\"The cause whereof I die, judge not. But if you judge, judge the best,\\" may be interpreted as a cautious declaration of his innocence which would avoid the forfeiture of his estates. An indication of his wife's continued trust in her husband is provided by her bequest to her son nine years later: \\"one bracelet of gold, the which was the last token his father sent me.\\" Portrayals William Brereton was portrayed by James Gilbert on the Showtime series, The Tudors, during season 2. The show plotted him as a Catholic assassin in the guise of courtier, commissioned by the Pope (Peter O'Toole) and ambassador Eustace Chapuys (Anthony Brophy) to assassinate Anne Boleyn (Natalie Dormer) to revert King Henry VIII (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) from steering the English state at collision course with the Catholic Church. He was accused of having had carnal knowledge of the queen. Unlike the others in his position, who either denied – George Boleyn (Pádraic Delaney) and Henry Norris (Stephen Hogan) – were tortured into admitting it – Mark Smeaton (David Alpay) – or acquitted – Thomas Wyatt (Jamie Thomas King) – Brereton falsely admitted his guilt to Thomas Cromwell (James Frain), knowing that it would ensure the Queen's conviction for high treason, and thus the fulfilment of his objective, albeit at the cost of his own life. On The Tudors, although Brereton was an actual historical figure, his character was totally fictionalised. William Brereton is portrayed as a young man, while in reality he was almost fifty. Moreover, he was not a Jesuit, nor was he commissioned by the Pope to assassinate Anne Boleyn. Anne was crowned queen in 1533 and executed in 1536, while the Pope did not formally establish the Jesuit order until 1540. Brereton was probably collateral damage when Thomas Cromwell moved against the Boleyn faction and decided to get rid of him in the same coup. In Wolf Hall, a TV mini-series adaptation of the historical novel by Hilary Mantel, he was played by Alastair Mackenzie.

Generally viewed as a conservative, her views were of great influence on working, middle classes and ruling Governments in Spain at that time. She was well known for her coverage of political scandals, such as those surrounding the collapse of Felipe González's government in 1996. She won three Ondas Awards, an annual recognition given in Spain to major media personalities and shows. Nevertheless, her show was not explicitly political, and concerned itself with general issues relevant to the Spanish public. Her subject matter could be roughly compared to that of The Oprah Winfrey Show, though Sánchez particularly emphasized social issues. She is known for keeping in touch with her listeners’ daily problems through the show’s long call-in segments. Style Her style was aggressive at times, more subdued and sympathetic in interviews. When she first appeared on radio, her powerful, slightly hoarse voice assisted her in drawing casual listeners surfing the airwaves. At the height of her popularity, she dominated the early evening timeslot, with ratings comparable to morning host Luis del Olmo, and midnight sports host José María García, of Supergarcia fame. Like García, but unlike del Olmo, she had many prominent enemies on whom she dealt especially strong criticism. Some were famous entertainment personalities, such as TV hosts whose shows she found distasteful. Others were important politicians whom she felt to be corrupt. Life and radio shows Encarna, the youngest of five siblings, was born in the little town of Carboneras, Almería on the Southeastern coast of Spain where a small square a few metres from the beach is named after her. She was only a few months old when her father, a Republican military official, was killed as he did not join the fascist uprising. When Encarna was 14 she used to meet her boyfriend after school. He worked for a local radio station in Almería and one day she was given the opportunity to sub for the regular host, a woman who was ill at the time. The show editor, who also happened to be the station manager, was impressed and offered her first contract. She was immediately enamored with the world of radio broadcasting. The following year she moved to Madrid to pursue a career as a radio host in the Radio Juventud Network which has a training school there. In her own words Encarna said that she 'passed in one year the required courses which would usually take five'. As a professional she worked for Radio Juventud and Radio España, in Madrid, and then she was in charge of marketing at a San Sebastián radio station, in the Basque Country of Northern Spain. Back in Madrid she began to be a well- known voice with nightly shows such as Esto es España, Señores (This is Spain, gentlemen), CS y buen Viaje (CS and good trip – CS being the show sponsor) and La noche vista por mí (The night as seen by me). In 1970, Encarna accepted a contract in Mexico and later worked for stations in the Dominican Republic and Los Angeles while she was studying radio production for the ABC network. She married a company manager in Los Angeles but they divorced after three years and she decided to come back to Spain at a time when the country was moving towards democracy, two years after Franco’s death in 1975. Though relatively popular in Madrid and Barcelona when she returned to Spain, Encarna was not a 'coast-to-coast' radio host yet, as Luis del Olmo, who had a program with that name, already was. That changed when she signed for COPE in 1981, a network she would not leave until her death. In the period 1978-81 she was the queen of the nights with her Encarna de Noche show (Encarna at night) in Radio Miramar, Barcelona. Then she hosted Directamente Encarna (Directly Encarna) in the early evenings since 1981. During the last years of her life, she faced lung cancer in her typical challenging brave hard-working mood. For some months, in her four-year fight, she flew daily to Switzerland for treatment in the morning to be at her desk in Madrid at 4 p.m. for the millions who had made it into a habit to tune into COPE to listen to the four-hour show. Once she started to fail to host more and more shows, speculation about her health began to spread in early 1996 as her listeners were given little information about a situation Encarna wanted to keep pretty much to herself by asking the few friends who knew about it not to reveal it was cancer. In her last months, she sometimes called up the show still being aired by COPE, in part because not even the managers knew exactly how serious her condition was and partly because of the great amount of revenue in sponsorship the show attracted even without her. Then, in one of these calls, she referred to her disease as that 'little ailment for which the doctor has advised a few days rest'. She said to the 'millions of friends' that had encouraged her that 'the sound radio has been for me, and will continue to be, the shortest way to understand the road to friendship and, above all the road to loyalty… Now, I am here …You will smile again soon. You’ll come to meet me again. Soon I will be able to say with all the courage in the world: tremble, bunch of crooks!!'. Encarna Sánchez died of lung cancer on April 5, 1996. Her voice is still missed by her listeners and has yet to find a comparable substitute. Though to many her style was extreme, populist and somewhat fanatic, her shows, above all the early ones, always had some form of social commitment and service as she helped—and entertained— millions of Spaniards for over 30 years. Controversies In her lifetime, one of the controversies surrounded Martes y Trece, one of the most famous comedians in Spain ever. The best known sketch of the duo was about a confused mum, calling Encarna’s nightly show while frying small pies to talk about her two sons and their military service in Móstoles, a suburban town near Madrid. The sketch evolved into complete confusion when the lady, who is never seen on stage, mixed up all the details of her conversation and even said that she was frying the two sons and that Móstoles was on fire. The sketch basically ridiculed working class women in trouble to make their point in the short span of the phone call, the so-called 'marujas' in Spain, who made up much of Encarna’s audience. The problem came a few years afterwards when the subject of ridicule was not the audience but Encarna herself and her close friend, famous folk singer Isabel Pantoja. In the new sketch, one of many in their show, Martes y Trece seemed to suggest, though in a very unclear way, an intimate relation between the two women. From then on Encarna’s comments towards the comedians turned into periods of silence and others of harsh criticism. Over the last year, a new crop of gossip and reality TV shows dealing with exposing all kinds of scandals led by 'Aquí hay tomate' (There’s tomato here) a Spanish TV equivalent to National Enquirer-meets-Springer, have sporadically returned to Encarna's private life with information by a former reporter of her shows and some from the 'bunch' she talked about in her last message.

It was the first new brewery opened in Australia since World War II and Australia's first craft brewery. Originating from small batches brewed for the Sail and Anchor Hotel in 1984, their main brewery opened in 1989 in a prominent building on the Stirling Highway occupied by Ford Motor Company. The company was purchased by Carlton & United Breweries in the early 1990s (now part of Anheuser-Busch InBev). History In 1983 Phil Sexton (a former brewer for the Swan Brewery), together with Garry Gosatti, John Tollis and Ron Groves, formed Brewtech Pty Ltd to brew commercial boutique beers. Due to lack of support from Perth Hotels the company purchased and renovated the Freemasons Hotel on the corner of South Terrace and Henderson Street, Fremantle. The hotel was renovated, a micro brewery installed and renamed the Sail and Anchor, under the banner of Anchor Brewing Company. The first beer, Anchor Ale, \\"a dark, copper-coloured, traditional ale\\", was produced in late 1984. In 1985 Brewtech opened their second venue, The Brewery Alehouse on Stirling Highway in Nedlands. The Company also established a second micro brewery at 31 Carrington Street in Nedlands, which housed the Matilda Bay Brewing Company and began producing beers in 1985. In 1986 the company launched its first wheat beer, Redback, which went on to be one of the company's best commercial successes. In 1987 Brewtech Pty Ltd changed their name to Brewtech Limited, following which they made the decision to consolidate their business under the Matilda Bay Brewing Company banner. The Company purchased another three outlets in Perth (including the Queens Hotel in Beaufort Street and the Brass Monkey in Northbridge). In 1988 Carlton & United Breweries (a wholly owned subsidiary of Elders IXL) purchased a 20% shareholding in the Matilda Bay Brewing Company, which led to the company in 1989 purchasing larger premises, the former Ford Motor Company building, on Stirling Highway in North Fremantle to brew their beers. In 1990, Elders IXL renamed the Foster's Group purchased the Matilda Bay Brewing Company, in a deal that valued Matilda Bay at more than A$50m. Carlton & United then sold the Sail and Anchor Hotel to the Australian Leisure and Hospitality Group (ALH), a subsidiary of Woolworths Limited, who subsequently closed the micro-brewery operations at the hotel. In 2000 the original brewers of Matilda Bay opened the Little Creatures microbrewery in Fremantle. In 2005, the Matilda Bay Garage Brewery began operating in South Dandenong, Victoria in an effort to brew small batches of more experimental beers, such as Alpha Pale Ale and Dogbolter, Crema, Barking Duck and Rooftop Red Lager. In June 2007 Fosters announced the Perth-based brewery would close in September and its beer production would be moved to its other breweries to improve cost and capital efficiency, with most of the larger volume production beers, such as Redback, Beez Neez, Fat Yak and Bohemian Pilsner being moved to the Cascade Brewery in Hobart.

César Franck wrote what is considered to be the first French organ symphony in his Grande Pièce Symphonique, and the composers Charles-Marie Widor, who wrote ten organ symphonies, and his pupil Louis Vierne, who wrote six, continued to cultivate the genre. Modern composers such as Aaron Copland and Jean Guillou have written organ symphonies as well. The genre is considered to have been brought to fruition in the second organ symphony of André Fleury.

Established across three continents in London (1891), New York (1892) and Melbourne (1893), the Review of Reviews, American Review of Reviews and Australasian Review of Reviews represented Stead's dream of a global publishing empire. Founder, W.T. Stead Stead was a career journalist who was drawn into reform politics in the 1880s, crusading through for such causes as British-Russian friendship, the reform of England's criminal codes, and the maintenance of international peace. He was most famous in Britain for having passed, almost single-handedly, the first child- protection law by investigating and reporting child vice and white slavery in a series of articles titled the \\"Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon\\", published in the Pall Mall Gazette in July 1885. As a result, the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 raised the consent age for girls from thirteen to sixteen, similar to \\"statutory rape\\" laws in the United States. As editor of the London Pall Mall Gazette (1883–1889), Stead caused newspapers to appear the way they are today. He introduced cross-heads (section titles) and signed articles, popularized interviews, and started illustrations and indexing. An advanced feminist, he was the first London editor to pay women equally with men. He authored many books, including The Truth about Russia (1888), If Christ Came to Chicago (1893), and The Americanization of the World (1902). His essay \\"How the Mail Steamer Went Down in Mid Atlantic\\" (1886) is considered his first prediction of the sinking of the RMS Titanic; his novel From the Old World to the New (1892) was the second prediction. Stead himself died in the sinking of the Titanic in 1912. The Review of Reviews The Review of Reviews was started in January 1890 by W.T. Stead and Tit-Bits proprietor Sir George Newnes. It was originally to be called the Six Penny Monthly and Review of Reviews, but this was changed at the last minute. According to Stead, it was \\"the maddest thing\\" he had yet done, on account that the venture had been decided on only a month before. The Review mirrored Stead's own over-active imagination and was written almost exclusively by him. Along with the dozens of magazine and book reviews it contained, it also included a running commentary of world events, entitled \\"The Progress of the World\\", and a character sketch of a current \\"celebrity\\". The first issue was an instant success, and opened with numerous facsimiled welcome messages which Stead had courted from various dignitaries of the time. However, Stead's relationship with Newnes came under strain when the latter strongly objected to Stead's scathing character sketch of The Times newspaper (eventually published in March). Perhaps seeing this discord as a sign of things to come, Newnes severed ties, exclaiming that the whole venture was \\"turning his hair grey\\". After buying out Newnes's share, Stead shaped the Review after his own image. With article titles such as \\"Baby-killing as an Investment\\" and \\"Ought Mrs. Maybrick to be Tortured to Death?\\", Stead showed he had lost none of the sledge hammer force of his journalistic days. He also involved the Review in social work, setting up the \\"Association of Helpers\\" and even an adoption agency called \\"The Baby Exchange\\". Stead was an early supporter and speaker of the language Esperanto and devoted one page to its promulgation in every issue. In 1891–92, Stead founded the equally successful American and Australian editions of the Review, and, in London, he added to his success with other literary triumphs, such as book series The Penny Poets,The Penny Poets (The Masterpiece Library: Series I) (\\"Review of Reviews\\" Office; Stead's Publishing House) – Book Series List, publishinghistory.com.

Retrieved 6 October 2019. all published under the Review's auspices. However, in spite of such apparent successes, without the business-like Newnes to guide him, Stead frequently drove the Review to death's door, despite the best efforts of his business manager, Edwin H. Stout. This was particularly the case during the Boer War (1899–1902), when his pro-Boer stance caused sales to slump to critical levels. Stead's attempt to recoup his losses, with the launch of the ill-fated The Daily Paper, was a complete failure and, almost bankrupt, he suffered a nervous breakdown. The Review somehow limped on, buoyed up by a narrow but devoted subscription base. But, following the loss of Stead in the Titanic disaster, it lost much of its force and, in c. 1917, was sold for just £25,000. It was eventually merged with World magazine and renamed the World Review in 1940. One of its latter editors was Lovat Dickson. The American Review of Reviews The American Review of Reviews was edited by the American academic, journalist, and reformer, Albert Shaw. Published from New York, The American Review of Reviews ran simultaneously alongside its British counterpart. As such, it represented the views and concerns of participants in the trans-Atlantic culture of progressive reform so brilliantly discussed in Daniel T. Rodgers's Atlantic Crossings: Social Politics in a Progressive Age (1998). Shaw was part of the first generation of academic reformers, which included Woodrow Wilson (who was his classmate at Johns Hopkins University). Born in Ohio, Shaw studied at Grinnell College and received his doctorate in government at Johns Hopkins in 1884. Declining an appointment at Cornell, Shaw became editor of the Minneapolis Tribune and a widely published author of books on municipal reform. The American Review of Reviews is one of the best primary sources on American reform between 1890 and 1920, providing not only a panoramic view of the range of reformers' interests, but also the ties between British and American progressives. By volume 3, however, its style had departed significantly from that of its British cousin. The American Review of Reviews ran until 1937, when it merged into The Literary Digest.

Matilda Bay is believed to have been named after the wife of John Septimus Roe, Matilda (née Bennett). History Crawley Bay in the 1890s Captain Currie was the first colonial owner of the estate surrounding the bay, at that time known as Currie's Bay. Pelican Point was then known as Point Currie. The estate was sold in 1832 to the Assistant Surveyor and Colonial Treasurer, Henry Charles Sutherland for £100. Sutherland named the property Crawley Park after his mother's maiden nameBrain, Alison V.(2001) Crawley Park and its occupants, 1829-1910. Early days, Vol.12, pt.1 (2001), p.39-46 and the bay became known as Sutherland's Bay. In 1876 Crawley Park was sold to Sir George Shenton, and the bay was known generally as Crawley Bay. After Shenton's death in 1909, the estate was acquired by the Government in 1910 and vested in the University of Western Australia in 1912. The US Navy had a fleet of Catalina flying boats based at Matilda Bay during World War II. In 1943, Qantas operated five Catalina flying boats between Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) and Matilda Bay in what was known as the Double Sunrise service.

It is typically created by infusing graphite or other conductive materials into ink. Conductive inks can be a more economical way to lay down a modern conductive traces when compared to traditional industrial standards such as etching copper from copper plated substrates to form the same conductive traces on relevant substrates, as printing is a purely additive process producing little to no waste streams which then have to be recovered or treated. Silver inks have multiple uses today including printing RFID tags as used in modern transit tickets, they can be used to improvise or repair circuits on printed circuit boards. Computer keyboards contain membranes with printed circuits that sense when a key is pressed. Windshield defrosters consisting of resistive traces applied to the glass are also printed. Many newer cars have conductive traces printed on a rear window, serving as the radio antenna. Printed paper and plastic sheets have problematic characteristics, primarily high resistance and lack of rigidity. The resistances are too high for the majority of circuit board work, and the non- rigid nature of the materials permits undesirable forces to be exerted on component connections, causing reliability problems. Consequently such materials are only used in a restricted range of applications, usually where the flexibility is important and no parts are mounted on the sheet. Conductive ink was once thought to be used in creative t-shirt marketing design. In this instance, sound controllers attached to the clothing could be activated depending on where a user pressed the shirt. Ultimately, this use never reached mainstream popularity.

The theorem was conjectured by Andrew Vázsonyi and proved by ; a short proof was given by . It has since become a prominent example in reverse mathematics as a statement that cannot be proved within ATR0 (a form of arithmetical transfinite recursion), and a finitary application of the theorem gives the existence of the notoriously fast-growing TREE function. In 2004, the result was generalized from trees to graphs as the Robertson–Seymour theorem, a result that has also proved important in reverse mathematics and leads to the even-faster-growing SSCG function. Statement We give the version proved by Nash-Williams; Kruskal's formulation is somewhat stronger. All trees we consider are finite. Given a tree with a root, and given vertices , , call a successor of if the unique path from the root to contains , and call an immediate successor of if additionally the path from to contains no other vertex. Take to be a partially ordered set.

(That is to > say, given any infinite sequence of rooted trees labeled in , there is some > so that .) Weak tree function Define , the weak tree function, as the length of the longest sequence of 1-labelled trees (i.e. ) such that: * The tree at position in the sequence has no more than vertices, for all . * No tree is homeomorphically embeddable into any tree following it in the sequence.

Friedman's work For a countable label set X, Kruskal's tree theorem can be expressed and proven using second-order arithmetic. However, like Goodstein's theorem or the Paris–Harrington theorem, some special cases and variants of the theorem can be expressed in subsystems of second-order arithmetic much weaker than the subsystems where they can be proved. This was first observed by Harvey Friedman in the early 1980s, an early success of the then-nascent field of reverse mathematics. In the case where the trees above are taken to be unlabeled (that is, in the case where X has order one), Friedman found that the result was unprovable in ATR0,Simpson 1985, Theorem 1.8 thus giving the first example of a predicative result with a provably impredicative proof.Friedman 2002, p. 60 This case of the theorem is still provable in Π-CA0, but by adding a \\"gap condition\\"Simpson 1985, Definition 4.1 to the definition of the order on trees above, he found a natural variation of the theorem unprovable in this system.Simpson 1985, Theorem 5.14Marcone 2001, p. 8–9 Much later, the Robertson-Seymour theorem would give another theorem unprovable inside Π-CA0. Ordinal analysis confirms the strength of Kruskal's theorem, with the proof-theoretic ordinal of the theorem equaling the small Veblen ordinal (sometimes confused with the smaller Ackermann ordinal). =TREE(3)= Suppose that P(n) is the statement: :There is some m such that if T1,...,Tm is a finite sequence of unlabeled rooted trees where Tk has n+k vertices, then Ti ≤ Tj for some i < j. All the statements P(n) are true as a consequence of Kruskal's theorem and Kőnig's lemma. For each n, Peano arithmetic can prove that P(n) is true, but Peano arithmetic cannot prove the statement \\"P(n) is true for all n\\".Smith 1985, p. 120 Moreover the length of the shortest proof of P(n) in Peano arithmetic grows phenomenally fast as a function of n, far faster than any primitive recursive function or the Ackermann function for example. The least m for which P(n) holds similarly grows extremely quickly with n. By incorporating labels, Friedman defined a far faster-growing function. For a positive integer n, take TREE(n) to be the largest m so that we have the following: :There is a sequence T1,...,Tm of rooted trees labelled from a set of n labels, where each Ti has at most i vertices, such that Ti ≤ Tj does not hold for any i < j ≤ m. The TREE sequence begins TREE(1) = 1, TREE(2) = 3, then suddenly TREE(3) explodes to a value so immensely large that many other \\"large\\" combinatorial constants, such as Friedman's n(4), are extremely small by comparison. In fact, it is much larger than nn(5)(5). A lower bound for n(4), and hence an extremely weak lower bound for TREE(3), is AA(187196)(1), where A() is a version of Ackermann's function: A(x) = 2\\\\uparrow^{x-1}x. Graham's number, for example, is approximately A64(4), which is much smaller than the lower bound AA(187196)(1). It can be shown that the growth-rate of the function TREE is at least f_{\\\\theta(\\\\Omega^\\\\omega \\\\omega)} in the fast-growing hierarchy. AA(187196)(1) is approximately g_{3 \\\\uparrow^{187196} 3}, where gx is Graham's function.

A pupil of the eminent pedagogue Pyotr Stolyarsky, he won the national competition for young performers in Leningrad (St. Petersburg) at the age of 15. In 1937, at one of the most prestigious international competitions of its time, the [International Ysaye Competition, Stoliarsky students caused a sensation. Top prizes were garnered by David Oistrakh, Boris Goldshtein (Goldstein), Yelizaveta Gilels and Mikhail Fikhtengoltz. \\"The results of the sessions created a profound impression: the Soviet school, with an assurance that bordered on arrogance, carried off all the prizes from the first down. The latter was awarded without the slightest discussion to the great David Oistrakh. Everyone else had to be content with crumbs; the Belgian violin school, though still a source of pride, failed, and its absence at the final was much commented on; Arthur Grumiaux and Carlo Van Neste, both young and inexperienced, were not able to convince the jury.\\" The Queen Elisabeth Competition He would go on to become a pedagogue as did David Oistrakh, Elizaveta Gilels, and others. During the height of Joseph Stalin's regime (Great Purge), Mikhail married the daughter of a high-ranking government official, who subsequently was executed as an \\"enemy of the people\\". His relatives immediately fell out of favor and Mikhail was told to divorce his politically stained wife. Fikhtengoltz refused to divorce her and immediately had all prestigious concerts cancelled. The nervous strain was heavy on him, and one of his hands failed - after a few minutes of playing, pain forced him to stop. Fikhtengoltz started making arrangements of popular piano and orchestral pieces, working in the studio, where he could always take a break and endure the pain. He was also increasingly getting into teaching, and soon after he was teaching at the Gnessin State Musical College in Moscow. During the mid-Sixties a leading psychotherapist ventured to get Mikhail playing again. Much to his colleagues’ surprise, the man quickly restored mobility to Mikhail’s failing hand. Mikhail rehearsed day and night, and after 23 years away from the stage, he began playing again. The strain to retrieve the time he had lost was great, and he died of a heart attack at the age of 65. Picking up where her father left off, Natalya Fikhtengoltz, a violinist and a talented teacher as well, is bringing up her students in the grand traditions bequeathed by the late Pyotr Stolyarsky. She has also released a series of CDs with recordings once made by her late father.Mikhail Fichtenholz Top # 17 Facts YouTube video References * * The Queen Elisabeth Competition * Roth, Henry (1997).

The song, written and composed by the original vocalist/guitarist Syd Barrett, was the first track on their first album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967). The lead vocal was sung by Barrett and the keyboard player Richard Wright. Its working title was \\"Astronomy Domine (An Astral Chant)\\". \\"Domine\\" (the vocative of \\"Lord\\" in Latin) is a word frequently used in Gregorian chants. Music =Sounds and references= It was seen as Pink Floyd's first foray into space rock (along with \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\"), although band members later disparaged this term. The song opens with the voice of one of their managers at the time, Peter Jenner, reading the names of planets, stars and galaxies through a megaphone. A barely audible line, \\"Pluto was not discovered till 1930\\", can be heard in the megaphonic mix. Barrett's Fender Esquire emerges and grows louder. At 0:19, a rapid beeping sound is heard. At 0:26, Nick Mason's drum fills begin and Barrett plays the enigmatic introductory figure. Keyboard player Richard Wright's Farfisa organ is mixed into the background. Barrett's incantatory lyrics about space support the theme in the song, mentioning the planets Jupiter, Saturn and Neptune as well as Uranian moons Oberon, Miranda and Titania, and Saturn's moon Titan. Barrett and Wright provide lead vocals. Roger Waters' bass guitar line, Wright's Farfisa organ and Barrett's slide guitar then dominate, with Jenner's megaphone recitation re-emerging from the mix for a time. =Music progression= The verse has an unusual chord progression, all in major chords: E, E♭, G and A. The chorus is entirely chromatic, descending directly from A to D on guitar, bass guitar and falsetto singing, down one semitone every three beats. Strangest of all may be the introduction, in which Barrett takes an ordinary open E major chord and moves the fretted notes down one semitone, resulting in an E♭ major chord superimposed onto an open E minor chord, fretting E♭ and B♭ notes along with the open E, G, B and high-E strings of the guitar; the G functions both as major third to the E♭ chord and minor third to the E chord. In the live version heard on Ummagumma (1969), the post-Barrett band, with David Gilmour on guitar, normalised the introduction into straight E and E♭ major chords, also normalising the timing of the introduction,Pink Floyd: Anthology (1980 Warner Bros. Publications, Inc., Secaucus N.J.) Transcribes \\"Astronomy Domine\\" as heard on Ummagumma but, beginning in 1994, began performing a more faithful version (as heard on Pulse), which Gilmour carried into his solo career. Barrett's Fender Esquire is played through a Binson echo machine, creating psychedelic delay effects. The track is the band's only overt \\"space rock\\" song, though a group-composed, abstract instrumental was titled \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\".A.Robbins, The Trouser Press record guide (Collier Books, 1991), \\\\- Nicholas Schaffner, Saucerful of Secrets: The Pink Floyd Odyssey, (Dell, 1992), , p.66. Waters, in an interview with Nick Sedgewick, described \\"Astronomy Domine\\" as \\"the sum total\\" of Barrett's writing about space, \\"yet there's this whole fucking mystique about how he was the father of it all\\".Sedgewick, Nick, \\"A Rambling Conversation with Roger Waters, Concerning All This and That\\", Wish You Were Here songbook, [USA ] Alternative and live versions It was a popular live piece, regularly included in the band's concerts. It is the first track on the live side of the album Ummagumma, released in 1969. This version reflects the band's more progressive style of that era. The song is extended by including the first verse twice, and the instrumental middle section, before becoming louder again by the last verse. The lead vocals are shared between Gilmour and Wright. While Wright sang the higher harmony in the studio version, Gilmour sang the higher harmony live. The Ummagumma version can also be found on the American release of A Nice Pair, a compilation album released in 1973. It was dropped from the live sets in mid-1971, but reappeared as the first song in some sets on the band's 1994 tour. The last time the song was performed with Waters was on 20 June 1971 at the Palaeur in Rome, Italy. A version from a concert in Miami appears as the B-side on the band's \\"Take It Back\\" single, and a version from one of the London concerts appears on the live album Pulse. Gilmour played the song at some of his appearances during his solo 2006 tour, again sharing the lead vocal with fellow Floyd member Wright. He said of playing the song live for the first time in over 20 years: The track is also on the 2001 Pink Floyd compilation album, Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd. The Pulse version reverts to the original 4-minute length, with Gilmour and Wright taking lead vocals as in Ummagumma. This was the only song on the 1994 tour with Gilmour, Mason and Wright performing without backing musicians, with only Guy Pratt adding bass guitar and vocals. The song was also played by Gilmour and his solo band (which included Wright with Pratt on bass guitar and Steve DiStanislao on drums) at the Abbey Road Studios sessions, which has been released as part of a CD/DVD On an Island package. \\"Astronomy Domine\\" was performed during the last few dates of Gilmour's On an Island tour, and is on his Remember That Night and Live in Gdańsk DVDs. Gilmour has inserted the song in the setlist of his last solo Rattle That Lock world tour. The song was played by Nick Mason's Saucerful of Secrets in 2018.https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/nick- mason/2018/the-half-moon-london-england-3bed3048.html Music video In 1968, Pink Floyd travelled to Belgium where they filmed a lip-synched promotional film for \\"Astronomy Domine\\", as well as \\"See Emily Play\\", \\"The Scarecrow\\", \\"Apples and Oranges\\", \\"Paint Box\\", \\"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\\" and \\"Corporal Clegg\\". Barrett does not appear in these films, as he had been replaced by Gilmour who lip-synced Barrett's voice in the \\"Astronomy Domine\\" video.

It is one of about 16 manuscripts from Mexico that are entirely pre-Columbian in origin. The codex derives its name from Zelia Nuttall, who first published it in 1902, and Baroness Zouche, its donor.British Library Add MS 39671British Library, Codex Zouche-Nuttall Description The Codex Zouche-Nuttall was probably made in the 14th century and is composed of 47 sections of animal skin with dimensions of 19 cm by 23.5 cm. The codex folds together like a screen and is vividly painted on both sides, and the condition of the document is by and large excellent. It is one of three codices that record the genealogies, alliances and conquests of several 11th and 12th century rulers of a small Mixtec city-state in highland Oaxaca, the Tilantongo kingdom, especially under the leadership of the warrior Lord Eight Deer Jaguar Claw (who died in the early twelfth century at the age of fifty-two). Provenance A facsimile of the Codex Zouche-Nuttall on display in the British Museum. The codex probably reached Spain in the 16th century. It was first identified at the Monastery of San Marco, Florence, in 1854 and was sold in 1859 to John Temple Leader who sent it to his friend Robert Curzon, 14th Baron Zouche. A facsimile was published while it was in the collection of Baron Zouche by the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Harvard in 1902, with an introduction by Zelia Nuttall (1857-1933).

It is a frazione of the provincial capital of Pisa, which lies about 10 km to the east. Geography Marina di Pisa lies on the left bank of the Arno River, where it flows into the Tyrrhenian Sea. It is located directly north of the seaside resort of Tirrenia and about 10 kilometers West from Pisa. Behind the town are forested sections of the Parco Regionale San Rossore, Migliarino, e Massaciucoli. From Marina di Pisa, it is possible to see the islands of Corsica, Elba and Gorgona; and the mountains of the Apuan Alps, Apennines, and Monti Pisani above Pisa. History Marina di Pisa was mostly built during the economic boom of the late 1800s, as a seaside resort. It was further developed in the 1930s. Many marine support industries developed at the mouth of the Arno river and in the area along its banks. Economy The German aviation company Dornier Flugzeugwerke based most of their production in the town from 1922 to 1932, after The Treaty of Versailles of 1919 banned construction of engine-powered aircraft in Germany. Here they built the \\"Wal\\" twin-engine flying boat. The huge 'Savigliano' hangar (1925) which remained standing till 2007, was used for the production of the Wals, and work on the Do-X2 and 3 in the early 1930s. Then the world's largest airplanes, they were broken up for scrap here in 1937. The village is mostly inhabited during summer, however there are many people that live here all year.

Circuit is a motor racing circuit located near Dalton-on-Tees in North Yorkshire, England. The tarmac circuit is just over long and is based on the lands of an airfield, but has long since moved on from being a basic airfield circuit. The circuit holds meetings of the British Touring Car Championship, British Rallycross and Pickup Truck Racing race series.  History  The first records of racing at Croft date back to the 1920s, but it was after the Second World War that Croft circuit became a significant motorsport venue. At the beginning of the Second World War an airfield named RAF Croft was built on the site now occupied by the circuit. RAF Croft also known as Croft Aerodrome, was mainly used as a bomber airfield. It was home to a number of different aircraft types including Wellington, Lancaster, Whitley, Stirling and Halifax bombers. There were a number of notorious accidents mainly involving returning bombers missing their runway. One bomber made it all the way back from Germany only to crash into a tree at Atley Hill, about away; all the crew were killed. The dead stump of the tree survived as a grim memorial on Atley Hill until it was grubbed out by the landowner in the mid 1990s. Croft Aerodrome was home to a number of squadrons including 419 Squadron from Canada. The platforms at the nearby Eryholme railway station were often crowded with airmen and ground crew during the war years. The verges along the public access road to Croft Aerodrome were used to store racks of bombs and other military equipment, a fascinating attraction to local children at the time. At the end of hostilities the aerodrome was abandoned by the RAF, it is still possible to see some military era buildings and structures surviving on nearby farmland, though most of the major structures such as hangars have been demolished and used as hardcore in the nearby villages of North Cowton, Dalton-on-Tees and Croft-on-Tees. In 1947 businessman and councillor John Neasham acquired the lease to the land and formed Darlington and District Aero Club. However, the club folded after only 5 years and the airfield fell into disuse. During the late 1940s and into the 1950s, Darlington & District Motor Club held Motor Race Meetings on various layouts utilising the runways and perimeter roads and then in 1962 Bruce Ropner and fellow enthusiasts bought half the venue at public auction, completing a track on the site in July 1964. The first meeting in August 1964, attracted a crowd of between 30,000 and 50,000 people. Over the years the circuit has played host to many famous names and has hosted national and international meetings. However, slowly attention focussed on circuits in the south of England such as Brands Hatch, Silverstone and Lydden and in December 1967 Croft began hosting Rallycross. The events were utilised by ITV's World Of Sport and were televised live. Whilst Rallycross was considered to be a winter sport, circuit racing continued. By 1981 the profitability had fallen and with the circuit requiring a total resurfacing, it closed to circuit racing. Local farmer, George Shield, agreed a lease to run Rallycross and, in conjunction with Darlington & District Motor Club, successfully developed the track for this sport. Croft held the FIA Internations-Cup events of 1987 and 1990 as well as the 1994 British round of the FIA European Rallycross Championship. With the attention brought by Rallycross the decision was taken to reintroduce tarmac racing and became a popular host of motorcycle and car racing. Corners 1 & 2 Fabrizio Giovanardi at the complex. In 1997 the circuit underwent a major transformation - the circuit was extended to and new pits, paddock complex, control tower and spectator areas were constructed. British Touring Cars and British Superbikes soon came to the circuit. British Superbikes remained a regular feature until 2011, while British Touring Cars remain a regular feature on the calendar. A regular Monster Energy British Rallycross Championship fixture continues the long history of Rallycross at Croft. The MSA British RallyCross Grand Prix featured at Croft in 2013.  Controversy  In 2000, an official complaint was upheld by local residents over the noise produced by the racing car engines. This was claimed to be having an effect on some people's health, although Darlington Borough Council later quashed this, Croft Circuit gives a number of free tickets to local residents as compensation for the noise. The circuit lost a court case in April 2008 and the claimants were awarded a total of £149,600 in compensation for the noise suffered but their request for an injunction against the existing operation of the circuit was refused. Both parties appealed this judgement. The appeal was heard on 15 January 2009 with the decision being made on 26 January 2009. The claimant's appeal was upheld; the injunction was granted and was the only substantive impact of the case. \\"Noisy days\\" were limited to 40 days. This had been the primary objective of the claimants and the outcome of the lawsuit was that the 40-day injunction was granted instead of monetary damages. The damage payments were therefore reduced to a nominal level, though the circuit was still liable for legal costs. The primary reasoning behind this outcome was that the circuit could make no reasonable case that its economic survival would be affected by this injunction. The circuit continues to operate its major race days which account for the vast majority of its revenue. (Feb 2009) A copy of the appeal judgement can be found at http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2009/15.html. (Feb 2009)  Major races  Croft has been staging major races since 1996. They are the British Touring Car Championship (BTCC), along with support series Porsche Carrera Cup Great Britain, Renault Clio Cup, Historic Car Racing, and Ginetta Junior Championship: and formerly hosted the UK Formula Renault, UK Formula BMW, SEAT Leon Cupra Championship. The British Superbike Championship left the calendar following the 2011 season and is not yet scheduled to return to Croft. Croft last featured on the F3/GT calendar for the 2007 and the 2008 season.

The trust maintains a shop and café, and the cliff–top views of rocks stretching into the distance along Bedruthan beach make the area a popular attraction for tourists and painters. The property affords walks along the coast path and the steep steps at Bedruthan allow access to a series of rocky beaches at low tide (not owned by the trust). Signs at the top of the steps down to the beaches warn visitors not to risk swimming in these waters due to heavy rips, fast tides, and submerged rocks. A rockfall occurred in February 2020 affecting the lower steps and the safety netting on surrounding rocks resulting in closure of the steps. History People have been in the area since at least the Bronze Age with six barrows nearby to the north, and overlooking Bedruthan Steps is Redcliff Castle, which dates back to at least the Iron Age. Redcliff Castle has three ramparts divided by two ditches, part of which have been quarried to improve the defences. Much of the internal parts of the castle have been eroded by the sea. A second castle is within a mile to the north at Park Head and two miles to the south at Griffin's Point, a third. Cliff Castles or promontory forts are defensive structures that are thought by archaeologists to be permanently occupied. In 2009, a menhir or longstone was discovered in a boundary hedge close to the coastal footpath. The stone lies on its side and is long. Evidence of mining exists as shafts on the cliffs nearby at Trenance Point, and adits above the beach at Carnewas. Carnewas mine itself started in 1855 and followed a lead lode accessible from near the tideline at low water with lodes containing silver, copper/antimony (Tetrahedrite) and nickel at a lower level. This working ceased operation in 1863 but the workings were opened again in 1868 to extract iron (Hematite), closing in 1874 having produced over 6000 tons of iron ore although between 1871 and 1874 total production was only 940 tons. Ladders and steps to the beach are thought to have been needed to reach the mine workings. The National Trust shop was originally the count house (office) of Carnewas Mine, and the cafe was one of the mine buildings. The name Bedruthan Steps is said to be taken from a mythological giant called Bedruthan, who used the rocks (stacks) on the beach as stepping stones, and seems to be a late-19th-century invention for Victorian tourists. The first written record of the name is from the West Briton newspaper in February 1847 and is likely to refer to one of two cliff staircases used by miners to get to the mine workings and now refers to the whole beach. Each of the stacks has a name and from north to south they are Queen Bess, Samaritan Island, Redcove Island, Pendarves Island, and Carnewas Island. Queen Bess rock was so named as it was supposed to resemble the outline of Queen Elizabeth I, although the head was lost after a storm in 1981. Samaritan Island is named after a ship the Good Samaritan, which was wrecked there in October 1846 with the loss of nine lives (another source states that the wreck occurred in 1850). A rhyme written at the time states, \\"The Good Samaritan came ashore, To feed the hungry and clothe the poor, With barrels of beef and bales of linen, No poor soul shall want for a shilling\\" Environment Bedruthan Steps from halfway point The section of coastline from Carnewas to Stepper Point is part of the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and subject to special landscape protection. In addition, Bedruthan Steps and Park Head is an Site of Special Scientific Interest, designated for its geological and biological interest in 1951. The site was subject to a revision in 1973 and renotified in 1986. It is noted for its slates and fossils from the Middle Devonian period, various mosses, and beetles. Bedruthan Steps is also a Geological Conservation Review site because it is a ″source of rare fish specimens″, which were first reported in 1848 by W Pengelly. ;Flora The coast here is exposed to westerly winds and the clifftops provide an exposed environment best suited to low-growing plants. Flowers to be found along the cost between Mawgan Porth and Bedruthan include Bird's foot trefoil, Kidney vetch, Sheep’s-bit and Spring squill, plus the distinctly maritime species Sea Pink (Thrift) and Sea Campion. ;Geology The bedrock at Bedruthan Steps is at the northernmost extent of a series of sedimentary rocks classified as sandstone, siltstone and mudstone and known as the Bedruthan Formation. The underlying rock from Bedruthan Steps to Trevose Head is Middle Devonian slates (386–377 Mya) with Staddon Grits to the south towards Trenance Point. The thickness of the slates have been estimated at over . Marine erosion by the sea carrying sand and pebbles has worn away the weaker, softer rocks to leave the stacks seen today. Fossils of fish, corals, trilobites, etc. have been found in the Eifelian slates on Samaritan and Pendarves Islands. Few fossils are useful for dating here, but one (although considered to be problematical) Pteroconus mirus dates the formations to the Eifelian. At the end of the headland of Park Head () is a subvolcanic rock, Diabase. ;Dark Sky discovery site In 2014, the area was granted \\"Dark Sky\\" status by the Science and Technology Facilities Council. Dark Sky discovery sites must be free from light pollution and have good views of stars and the Milky Way, and be accessible to the public.

It began life as a tramway, reopened as a railway on 27 April 1876, and operated until 18 July 1959. At Himatangi there was a junction with the Sanson Tramway, a line operated by the Manawatu County Council that was never upgraded to the status of a railway. Construction At the mouth of the Manawatu River, the settlement of Foxton was seen in the 1860s as a possible port for the Manawatu region. Roads often became treacherous and impassable in bad weather, and as the Manawatu River was not navigable far inland, a more dependable route than the roads was necessary so that the region could receive imports and export its products, particularly timber. Due to poor financial conditions at the time, a tramway built with wooden rails rather than a railway was proposed in 1865 as a cost-effective mode of transport. Not even this was affordable at the time, and it was not until Julius Vogel announced his \\"Great Public Works\\" policy in 1870 that construction was finally approved. As planned in 1865, the line was built as a wooden-railed tramway, with construction commencing in 1871. On 20 August 1872, a steam locomotive constructed by the Dunedin firm of Messrs R. S. Sparrow and Co. was delivered and operated on the completed portion of tramway; this was the first New Zealand-built locomotive to run. 1994 replica of 1872 NZR Palmerston locomotive was built on a 1931 La-6 truck and is outside Foxton's Court House Museum, as seen in 2018 The line was completed to Palmerston North on 25 July 1873, a distance of 40 kilometres, and soon proposals were made to extend it to Wanganui. However, by 1874, the inadequacies of wooden rails were becoming apparent, and after an attempt at relaying the line with iron rails in February 1875 did not provide the durability required, the decision was made to relay the line with steel rails to railway standards. The land through which the line ran was generally flat, with the Oroua River the only serious obstacle. It was crossed with a bridge. The line was formally re-opened as a railway on 27 April 1876. In 1886 the Wellington and Manawatu Railway (WMR), the private company established to build the \\"West Coast\\" line due to the government's inaction, opened from Wellington to the Foxton line at Longburn, near Palmerston North. The government's original plan had been to extend the Foxton line down to Wellington, but the WMR announced in 1881 that it would follow the most direct route to Palmerston North, bypassing Foxton. The Foxton line effectively became a branch line from Longburn, though it remained the southern terminus of the government railway until 1908, when the WMR was purchased and incorporated in the North Island Main Trunk railway linking Wellington and Auckland. Stations The following stations were on the Foxton Branch, with the distance from the junction at Longburn in brackets: *Karere (2 km) *Tiakitahuna (4 km - Ekatahuna until October 1878) *Rangitane (8 km) *Rangiotu (10 km - Oroua Bridge until 11 December 1910) *Bainesse (15 km) *Himatangi (22 km - Carnarvon until 1 August 1901) *Motuiti (27 km - also Motuiti Pah Siding until 1876) *Foxton (31 km - 1876-1881 in Main Street by the Post Office, 1881-1888 new station at wharf, 1888-1902 following a fire, re-using old station, which had been moved to wharf, 1903-1959, following another fire, station similar to that of 1881, though reduced in size from 1947) Operation The line was very important for its first 12 years. Northbound freight and passengers from Wellington came up the west coast via ship and transferred to the railway in Foxton, and the town was served by express trains. When the WMR's line opened, traffic to Foxton dropped so markedly that services were slashed to run on alternate days, though daily trains were later restored. Passenger ships between Wellington and Foxton disappeared overnight. Most freight also used the new line, but the government railways did not wish to utilise a competitor's service and continued to ship railway coal in via Foxton. The flax trade in the region also continued to use Foxton as a harbour and provided traffic for the line. In 1903 a mixed train ran daily between Foxton and Palmerston North, and it was augmented by a passenger train to and from Palmerston North three times a week. In 1913, the passenger train operated six days a week. However, freight services were in decline: with the acquisition of the WMR in 1908, the Railways Department ceased shipping coal via Foxton. The wharf's condition was deteriorating and by 1916, only one shipping company, with two steamers, used Foxton, and when the company's main shed burnt down in 1922 it ceased to operate. Local interests continued to try to generate shipping traffic but met with little success and only a small amount of traffic was generated for the railway. In 1942, all shipping via Foxton ceased. Passenger services ceased on 20 August 1932, and the locomotive depot closed, with the only trains being a daily goods service from Palmerston North. During World War II, troop trains ran as the Manawatu Mounted Rifles established a camp on Foxton's racecourse, but after the war traffic continued to decline. Only three trains ran a week in 1952; in comparison, road freight services to the town were thriving. A mere 5,500 tonnes per annum were railed off the branch to other destinations, while 13,000 tonnes of freight came onto the line. The traffic outwards was mostly woolpacks and root crops, while lumber, lime, manure and coal were the primary traffic inwards. Closure was inevitable, but the line survived until the end of the 1950s. A farewell passenger excursion ran on 17 July 1959 (see video), and the last freight train operated a few days later. Formal closure was on 27 July. The branch today The line ran for much of its length right beside State Highways 1 and 56, but road re-alignment and flood control earthworks have destroyed much of the formation. Near Longburn, SH 56 utilises the formation. Rubble from both the railway and old road bridges across the Oroua River can still be seen from the new road bridge. The station site and formation northwards remain visible in Foxton. Cycling enthusiasts have advocated for the construction of a rail trail roughly following the route of the Foxton Branch as part of a strategy to encourage more people to take up cycling and attract more visitors to the region.

It was designed by Hidalgo Moya and Philip Powell, and built between 1965 and 1968. The quadrangle has been described as \\"One of the best buildings of its kind during the expansion of higher education\\" by Lord McIntosh of Haringey, Minister for Culture, Media and Sport. The quadrangle has held the classification of Grade II* listed building since 17 October 2006, a status shared by only 20,000 other structures in the country due to the unique nature of its 1960s architecture. Blue Boar underwent a substantial renovation from 2007-8, resulting in the conversion of all rooms to modern en-suites. The Blue Boar Quadrangle is just to the south of the historic Blue Boar Street, off St Aldate's, hence the name.  Usage  The quadrangle, which hosts 61 Christ Church, Oxford first years during term time and interviewees and conference guests during the Christmas, Easter and Long Vacations is viewed by many as an eyesore when compared to other quadrangles (e.g., Peckwater Quadrangle, Tom Quad) in the college. The accommodation consists of mostly medium sized rooms with a desk, bed, fridge and window seat. With the large windows, the lighting is sufficient to work by, although may be considered dull by some. Some rooms at ground level have a small problem with damp, due to the single-glazed windows and proximity to the grass. Architecture Blue Boar Quadrangle was built on the site of an old car park and garages, next to the narrow, high- walled Blue Boar Street. The quadrangle was designed so that the top floor penthouses provide a broken, set-back series of horizontal planes that help to reduce the scale of the development seen from the street and is constructed almost entirely of characteristic Portland Whitbed and Roach Stone, which adds a unique quality absent from most 1960s developments. The quad itself is an 'L' shape, the rectangular nature being interrupted by the old college brewhouse. Most of the staircases are four storeys but staircase four is three storeys with a semi-basement, which houses archives and a meeting room. There is also a new route from the path to Tom Quad which loops back behind Killcanon and brings you straight into the middle of the Blue Boar Quad. This is for students only, but is repeatedly defied by tourists in an attempt to see Oxford students in their 'natural habitat'. The route is slightly longer than going through Killcanon but decidedly more aesthetically pleasing.

Samali or Samale ' ', was a progenitor who according to Somali tradition is considered the oldest common forefather of several major Somali clans and their respective sub-clans. It constitutes the largest and most widespread Somali lineage. Two of the constituent Samaale sub-clans, the Dir and Hawiye, are regarded as major clans today.  History  According to many documented sources and historians, the patriarch Samaale arrived in northern Somalia from Yemen during the 9th century and subsequently founded the eponymous Somali ethnic group. Shariif 'Aydaruus Shariif 'Ali's records in his book Bughyat al-amaal fii taariikh as-Soomaal that Samaale was Uthman the son of Mahamed, a military leader commanding an army sent from Egypt, Suez to East Africa, Mogadishu to aid and join the Muslims in their fight against their enemies. They waged a war and when Samaale heard the news of his father passing away he migrated from his homeland Yemen to East Africa and made it his homeland marrying from the locals. Thus Uthman (Samaale) came to live in the area we know today as the Somali peninsula and founded the Samaale group. The progenitor Samaale is generally regarded as the source of the ethnonym Somali. Other state the word Somali is derived from the words soo and maal, which together mean \\"go and milk\\"—a reference to the ubiquitous pastoralism of the Somali people. Another etymology proposes that the term Somali is derived from the Arabic for \\"wealthy\\" (zāwamāl), again referring to Somali riches in livestock. Shariif 'Aydaruus Shariif 'Ali mentions that in relation to the name 'Samaale', there were many notable people before him known as 'Samaale' like Abu 'Samaal' Al 'Adwi an Arab orator, poet and descendant of Ali and 'Samaal Ibn 'Awf the grandfather of Majashi' ibn Mas'ud the Companion, also Sayaal ibn 'Samaal' ibn Hareesh and Khalid ibn Abi Yazeed ibn 'Samaal', both scholars of the Hadith tradition.\\" Many sources claim that Samaale traces its geneological traditions to Arabian Quraysh Banu Hashim origins through Aqiil the son of Abu Talib ibn Abd al-Muttalib, who was cousin of the Prophet Muhammed. According to the British anthropologist and Somali Studies veteran I.M. Lewis, the traditions of descent from noble Arab families related to the Prophet embraced by all Somali clans are most probably figurative expressions of the importance of Islam in Somali society.I.M. Lewis, A pastoral democracy: a study of pastoralism and politics among the Northern Somali of the Horn of Africa, (LIT Verlag Münster: 1999), pp.128-129 The paternal genetics of ethnic Somalis are inconsistent with a post-Islamic common TMRCA (time to most recent common ancestor) and with a post-Islamic paternal Arabian origin for the majority of the ethnicity. The majority of Somalis have an TMRCA between 4,000-2,000 years before present in the Bronze Age.  Genealogy  The eponymous ancestor of majority of Somalis today had 9 sons, which is shown in the genealogical table below: **** Hiil ***** Samaale *****# Irir: *****#* Dir (Gadabuursi, Issa, Bimal, Gurgura, Surre, Bursuk etc.). *****#* Hawiye (Habar Gidir, Abgaal, Wa'dan, Mursade, Gugundhabe). *****#Gardhere:Garre, Gaalje'el, Degodi Massare, Issa and 'Awrmale *****# Mayle: Hawadle *****# Maqarre: Dabarre and Irrole *****# Yahabur: Hubeer *****# Gariife *****# Hammarre\\"Harmalle\\": Ajuran *****# Harire *****# Karur Although Quranyow is part of the Garre confederacy, the sub-clan actually claims descent from Dir, son of Irir, son of Samaale.The Quranyo section of the Garre claim descent from Dirr, who are born of the Irrir Samal. UNDP Paper in Kenya http://www.undp.org/content/dam/kenya/docs/Amani%20Papers/AP_Volume1_n2_May2010.pdf This example does indeed strengthen the Somali saying: \\"Tol waa tolane\\", which means \\"clan is something joined together\\" The same could be said about Gaaljecel, Degodi and Hawadle who have allied themselves to the Hawiye section of Irir in the borders of Somalia, the Dabarre and Irrole of Maqarre and the Garre who have allied themselves to the Digil Rahanweyn confederacy and 'Awrmale to the Harti Darood section.Dabarre and Iroole Digil (Rahanweyn) groups in southern Somalia.http://dice.missouri.edu/docs/afro- asiatic/Dabarre.pdf The Rahanweyn (Digil and Mirifle) clan traces descent from a separate patriarch called Sab.

This permits a fraternal sharing between the monks. Conversation during the walk is light-hearted and simple. The spatiamentum also provides physical space and exercise. In inclement weather, the walk is postponed to the next day. The spatiamentum probably became a formal part of Carthusian life around the twelfth century, in order to balance solitude with human contact, and provide some relaxation and respite from a strict rule and the focus on spiritual matters. Dom Le Masson, the eighteenth century prior general of the order, wrote, \\"It is only with the greatest reluctance that I grant leave off the spatiamentum, and then only to the aged. So great, it appears to me, is the utility of this walk for good of both body and soul.

In July 2013, the weekday editions also went from broadsheet to compact. The newspaper was a member of the now defunct New Zealand Press Association. =Ownership= Charles Dixon and Horace Weeks started the newspaper to oppose Joseph Ivess, who had started the Evening News earlier in 1879 in support of his mayoralty campaign. In the following year, they sold the newspaper to Edward George Wright and Hugo Friedlander, the latter of whom had beaten Ivess in the mayoral election. In 1885, they sold the Guardian to William Steward, who himself sold to Robert Bell in 1900.

After first joining the United States Navy, he developed an interest in experimental film and attended the USC School of Cinematic Arts in the late 1960s. On the strength of a couple of short films, he was picked by John Dykstra to work as first cameraman at the embryonic Industrial Light & Magic on the production on Star Wars for which he shared an Academy Award. Edlund continued to work with Dykstra on Battlestar Galactica but was invited back by George Lucas to work on The Empire Strikes Back. Edlund's considerable technical challenge on this film was to optically composite miniatures against a white background resulting in a second Academy Award. Edlund also did distinguished work for Lucas and ILM on Raiders of the Lost Ark and Poltergeist. In 1983, following the completion of Return of the Jedi, Edlund set up his own effects company, Boss Films, whose credits include Ghostbusters, Big Trouble in Little China, Die Hard, The Hunt for Red October, Cliffhanger, Outbreak and Air Force One. Boss Film Studios was one of the first traditional effects houses that successfully transitioned from \\"tangible world\\" visual effects, to computer generated imagery, with many notable CGI artists beginning their careers at Boss.

Dick. The film starred Gary Sinise, Madeleine Stowe, Vincent D'Onofrio, and Mekhi Phifer and was directed by Gary Fleder. Plot The film takes place in 2079. Forty-five years earlier, Earth was attacked by a hostile and implacable alien civilization from Alpha Centauri. Force shield domes are put in place to protect cities, and a totalitarian global military government is established to effect the war and the survival of humans. The Centaurians have never been physically seen. The film follows Spencer Olham, a designer of top-secret government weapons. One day while on his way to work, he is arrested by Major Hathaway of the Earth Security Administration (ESA), being identified as a replicant created by the aliens. The ESA intercepted an alien transmission which cryptanalysts decoded as programming Olham's target to be the Chancellor, whom he was scheduled to meet. Such replicants are perfect biological copies of existing humans, complete with transplanted memories, and do not know they are replicants. Each has a powerful \\"U-bomb\\" in their chest in the exact design of a human heart, which can only be detected by dissection or a high-tech medical scan, since it only arms itself and detonates when it gets in close proximity to its target. Detection via the special scan works by comparing against a previous scan, if there was one. Major Hathaway begins interrogating Olham. As Hathaway is about to drill out Olham's chest to find the bomb, Olham breaks loose and escapes, accidentally killing his friend Nelson in the process. With the help of underground stalker Cale, Olham avoids capture and sneaks into the hospital where his wife Maya is an administrator to get the high-tech scan redone and prove he's not a replicant. But the scan is interrupted by security forces before it can deliver the answer. That evening, after fleeing from the city, Olham and Maya are eventually captured by Hathaway's troops in a forest near an alien crash site, close to the spot where they spent a romantic weekend just a week or so before Olham's arrest. Inside the ship they discover the corpse of the real Maya, and Hathaway shoots and kills the replicant before she can detonate. Hathaway thinks he has killed the true impostor, but as his men move debris away from the Centauri ship, the real Spencer Olham's body is revealed. At that moment, Olham realizes aloud that both Maya and himself really are alien replicants, and the secondary trigger (his awareness of what he truly is) detonates his U-bomb, destroying himself, Hathaway, his troops, and everything else in a wide area in a fiery nuclear explosion. In the final scene, the news announces that Hathaway and the Olhams were killed in an alien enemy attack, implying that the government covered up or are unaware of the truth. Cale wonders if he ever really knew Olham's true identity.

The other shorts were to be adaptations of Isaac Asimov's story \\"The Last Question\\" by Bryan Singer and Donald A. Wollheim's story \\"Mimic\\" by Matthew Robbins. \\"Mimic\\" had already been adapted into a film of the same name, but with a different script. The short was originally written by Scott Rosenberg, with revisions by Mark Protosevich and Caroline Case. When it was decided to expand the short into a feature-length film, additional scenes were written by Richard Jeffries, Ehren Kruger, and David Twohy. Burn areas in Running Springs, California, were used to create the spacecraft crash site. Sets were constructed in Angeles National Forest and in numerous areas around Los Angeles. Most of the interiors were built on stage in Manhattan Beach, including a two-story hospital and 3-story pharmacy, and a commuter transport station with articulated commuter \\"bugs\\". Other filming locations included the Coachella Valley. Download (Downloadable PDF file) The movie was made on an estimated $40 million budget. Reception =Critical response= Impostor received negative reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 24% based on 96 reviews. Metacritic gives the film a score of 33% based on 26 reviews. James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film two-and-a-half stars (out of four), saying \\"there are a few moderately diverting subplots and the storyline eventually gets somewhere,\\" but added that \\"Impostor wears out its welcome by the half-hour mark, and doesn't do anything to stir things up until the climax. You could spend the entire midsection of this movie in the bathroom and not miss much.\\" William Arnold of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer gave the film a mildly positive review, praising lead actor Gary Sinise's ability to \\"hold the film together and provide a strong, sympathetic human focus. The movie's atmosphere has a very definite Blade Runner feel.\\" Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide gave the film three stars out of four, saying it packed \\"a real emotional wallop,\\" but suggested that it would have worked better as the 40-minute short film it was originally intended to be. Keith Phipps of The Onion's The A.V. Club gave the film a negative review, saying that \\"it essentially uses the setup of [the story] as a bookend to one long, dull chase scene.\\" Robert Koehler of Variety also criticized the film, calling it \\"a stubbornly unexciting ride into the near future.\\" A. O. Scott of The New York Times offered a sardonic view of the movie's \\"dark view of the future\\" (\\"a badly lighted one, that is\\"), of the editing (\\"pointlessly hyperkinetic\\"), and of the \\"twist\\" ending (\\"meant to be clouded with ambiguity, but really it is unequivocally happy because it means the movie is over\\"). = Box office = The film earned a little over $6 million at the box office in the United States and Canada, with the estimated worldwide of over $8 million, thus making it a box office failure.

It was one of the three universities formed in 1970 from the original University of Montpellier. Its main campus neighbors the Montpellier 3 University's main campus, and for this reason the nearest tramway station is named \\"Universities of Sciences and Literature\\" rather than \\"University of Sciences\\". In January 2015, Montpellier 1 University and Montpellier 2 University merged into the Montpellier University (Université de Montpellier).  History  The creation of the imperial University by Napoleon I in 1808 stimulated the formation of a number of faculties of Humanities and of Science in the main cities of the French Empire. At that time, Montpellier had already a long-established medical college and a school of Pharmacy, but also a respected Royal Society of Sciences created in 1706. In 1810, a Faculty of Science started with initially seven chairs: mathematics, astronomy, physics, chemistry, zoology, botany, and mineralogy. In 1879, the faculty created a research station of marine biology in Sète, and, twelve years later, and Institute of Botany (which is still part of University Montpellier 2). The Institute of Chemistry, created in the same period, became the Ecole Nationale Supérieure of Chemistry of Montpellier in 1941. In 1964, the faculty left the centre of Montpellier to settle in a 30 hectare campus to the north of the city on which 146 000 m2 of buildings for teaching and research were built.  Heritage  Institute of Botany of Montpellier The University Montpellier 2 retains the Institute of Botany of Montpellier (created in 1889 by Professor Charles Flahault), which is close to the botanical garden of University Montpellier 1. Partly demolished after World War II, most of the buildings date from 1956. The building houses a prestigious herbarium, the largest in France after the national museum of natural history, with approximately 4 million samples and an important collection of botany vellums, and research laboratories in the fields of ecology and parasitology. The station of marine biology in Sète has been part of the University since 1879. In addition to these collections, the university's media library brings together its old collections of printed works, manuscripts, and iconography (including, for example, the library of the work of Felix Dunal, bequeathed to the Faculty of Science in 1856). These collections are publicly accessible given a reasonable request.

Life and history Grimston was the eldest son of the Rev. and Hon. Robert Grimston, Canon of St Albans, and grandson of James Grimston, 2nd Earl of Verulam. Grimston was educated at Windlesham House School and Repton School, before going on to the City and Guilds Engineering College and the University of London. During World War I, he was commissioned into the RGA (6th Howitzers) in 1916 and served in Thessaloniki and Palestine from 1916–1919. Grimston was elected as Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Westbury, Wiltshire in 1931, holding the seat until 1964. He served as a Junior Lord of the Treasury and Assistant Whip (unpaid) in 1937, Vice-Chamberlain of the Household from 1938–1939, Treasurer of the Household from 1939–1942. He then held junior ministerial office as Assistant Postmaster-General from 1942–1945 and as Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Supply in 1945. He was later Deputy Chairman of Ways and Means from 1962–1964, and was a member of the UK Delegation to the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1960. Grimston was created a Baronet on 11 March 1952 and was raised to the peerage being created Baron Grimston of Westbury, of Westbury in the County of Wiltshire, on 11 December 1964.

It was the first Primus song bassist and lead singer Les Claypool ever composed.https://consequenceofsound.net/2017/09/les-claypool-breaks-down-the- entire-primus-discography/full-post A reworked version featuring drummer Bryan \\"Brain\\" Mantia can be found on their Rhinoplasty EP (1998). Lyrics The song is mostly about the band's reflection on war, and how many soldiers are too young to go off to war, parodying the idea of \\"the dogs of war\\" by claiming the dogs are merely puppies. The song was written six years prior to the first Persian Gulf War (despite being released in 1990) and was possibly about violence happening around the region during that time period, such as the Soviet–Afghan War or Iran–Iraq War. Music video A video was in production for \\"Too Many Puppies\\", but the project was canceled when Primus was signed to Interscope Records. The video had been a rarity until 2003, when it was released on Animals Should Not Try to Act Like People. The music video features a man who, after shaving his head, acts weird with army material (such as an army helmet, a pair of boots, and a rifle) and a woman in makeup (presumably his mother) and milk, all in accordance with the song's lyrics; interspersed are shots of the band playing live in front of a rowdy crowd.

Fort Kearny State Park and Museum, Nebraska The McClellan saddle was a riding saddle designed by George B. McClellan, a career Army officer in the U.S. Army, after his tour of Europe as the member of a military commission charged with studying the latest developments in engineer and cavalry forces including field equipment. Based on his observations, McClellan proposed a design that was adopted by the Army in 1859. The McClellan saddle was a success and continued in use in various forms until the US Army's last horse cavalry and horse artillery was dismounted late in World War II. Today, the McClellan saddle is used by ceremonial mounted units in the US Army. The saddle was used by several other nations, including Rhodesia and Mexico, and to a degree by the British in the Boer War. The saddle came in various seat sizes that predominantly ranged from approximately 11 to 12 ½ inches. Origin and development In April 1855, six years before the start of the Civil War, Captain George B. McClellan sailed to Europe as part of a military commission to study developments in European tactics, weaponry, and logistics. McClellan's focus was the organization of engineer troops and cavalry. After the one-year tour, during which time McClellan observed several battles of the Crimean War, McClellan brought back almost 100 books and manuals. These he read before writing his report, which concluded with his proposed manual for American cavalry adapted from existing Russian cavalry regulations. He also proposed a cavalry saddle that he claimed was a modification of a Hungarian model used in the Prussian service. The saddle was almost certainly a modification of the Spanish tree saddle in common use in Mexico during this period, and which had become common in some parts of the US. The McClellan saddle was adopted by the US War Department in 1859 and remained standard issue, in various models, for the remaining history of the horse cavalry. The original M1859 version was the form used during the Civil War, and the design saw subsequent modifications. The saddle always remained recognizable as McClellan's design, which included cavalry and artillery models. In addition, a model for packers was introduced as the M1913. Confederate variants in the Civil War During the American Civil War, many Confederate cavalrymen provided their own horses and civilian saddles. In time, the Confederacy issued the Jenifer saddle. But when Southerners' horses grew thin because of inadequate food supply, the Jenifer saddle became painful to the bony withers of the horses. In 1863, the Confederate army issued the lighter and better- contoured McClellan saddle to its cavalry. Because leather was scarce in the South during the Civil War, many of the McClellan saddles had skirts of painted canvas. The Confederate Army also used some British saddles as well. McClellan saddle in black leather, post-Civil War period. Fort Kearny State Museum M1904 McClellan saddle in russet-brown leather, World War I period. Fort Kearny State Museum Influences on McClellan's design The design was based on the Spanish tree saddles in wide use in the United States at the time, and which had seen US Army use, although McClellan claimed that it was based on Hussar saddles he'd observed in use in the Crimean War. While McClellan did go overseas and observe the Crimean War for the US, the saddle does not closely duplicate any pattern in use by the armies in that conflict, but is very close to the widely used Spanish tree saddle, which was originally a saddle in common use in Mexico. The design underwent modifications over time, although in many ways it remained remarkably unchanged. The saddle was simple and less expensive than existing saddles, light enough not to burden the horse, but sturdy enough to give good support to the rider and his gear. It supported a rawhide-covered open seat, a thick leather skirt, wooden stirrups, and a girth strap of woolen yarn. Added accessories to the saddle sometimes included a nose bag for horse feed, a curry comb to groom the horse, a picket pin and lariat to tether the horse while grazing, saddlebags, and a \\"thimble\\" that held the muzzle of the cavalryman's carbine. The McClellan saddle was placed on top of a saddlecloth, shabrack, or saddle blanket. Service and rivals in the US Army As noted above, the McClellan saddle served, and has continued to serve, for an extraordinarily long time in the U.S. Army. The saddle has been in uninterrupted use since 1859. The saddle did see some modification over time. Perhaps the most significant alterations occurred in the 20th Century, when the rigging was changed twice. The first time, an adjustable rigging was adopted, leading to the M1904 McClellan. That pattern is the most common of all McClellan saddles, and continued in use throughout World War I and World War II. However, increased emphasis on equitation in the US Army also lead to the M1928, which was an M1904 with English rigging and fenders. This variant, the final one in US service, fit closer than other McClellan saddles, and is still used by the US Army in ceremonial uses. The saddle, while passing the test of time, was not without its rivals or critics. The first significant challenger was the Whitman saddle, named after a former US Army officer who designed it. The Whitman had many of the McClellan's features and is often mistaken for the McClellan. While not supplanting it, it was approved for use by officers and remained an approved officers' saddle throughout World War I. In later years, it incorporated so many McClellan features that it became known as the \\"Whitman- McClellan.\\" In the 20th Century, a serious effort was made to replace the McClellan through tests of the US Army's M1912 equipments. The M1912 saddle proved to be unsuccessful in the Punitive Expedition, but it demonstrated a great departure from the McClellan design, resembling in some ways the British Universal Pattern saddle. Subsequently, the Army tested the M1917 saddle, but it was not adopted. Enormous quantities of M1904 McClellans were purchased by the US Army in World War I, effectively preventing any new saddle from being adopted for general use for decades. The US Army did approve a saddle of the English saddle type prior to World War I for officers, and after the war approved another, with the adoption of the Philip's saddle for officers. Use and service outside the United States The saddle also saw considerable civilian use, and was made for civilian sales by a variety of manufacturers. It was widely used in the United States by mounted policemen. It was adopted by Mexico, in a Mexican-made version, for their army. At least some were sold to the Dominion forces in the Boer War, and the North-West Mounted Police in Canada obtained at least a few for test purposes. The saddle was adopted by Rhodesia in the 1970s for use by the Grey's Scouts. South Africa used some quantities for mounted game wardens in the 1980s in South West Africa. Legacy and continued use While the McClellan saddle was not perfect and had critics, it was one of the most enduring military saddles of all time, rivaled only by the British Universal Pattern saddle in its longevity. The saddle was used by every branch of the US Army, the US Marine Corps, and was widely used by mounted police units throughout the US. The McClellan saddle continues to be made in the US, and was used by endurance riders at one time. It is made for use as a pleasure saddle for those few who like it for that purpose, and as a saddle for historical reenactors.

The accounts of the Jesuit Relations frequently refer to the Mascouten as the \\"Fire Nation\\" or \\"Nation of Fire\\". One Jesuit writes: \\"The Fire Nation is erroneously so called, its correct name being Maskoutench, which means \\"a treeless country,\\" like that inhabited by these people; but as, by changing a few letters, this Word is made to signify \\"fire,\\" therefore the people have come to be called the Fire Nation.\\" Their name apparently comes either from a Fox word meaning \\"Little Prairie People\\" or from the Sauk term Mashkotêwi (\\"Prairie\\") or Mashkotêwineniwa (\\"Plains Indians\\") and shkotêwi (\\"fire\\") which would fit the Jesuits statement.Gordon Whittaker: A Concise Dictionary of the Sauk Language Historians do not know what they called themselves (autonym).Lee Sultzman, \\"Mascouten History\\", Dickshovel, accessed 5 July 2010 The Huron knew them also as Atsistaeronnon (\\"people of the fire\\").The Early Map \\"Novvelle France\\": An Linguistic Analysis They are first mentioned in historic records by French missionaries, who described the people as inhabiting the southern area of present-day Michigan.

She is the daughter of Liverpool entertainer and BBC Radio Merseyside presenter Billy Maher. Musical career In the 1980s, prior to joining River City People, Maher had been a vocalist with the local bands Passion Polka, Peep Show (with future RCP bassist Dave Snell, to whom she was briefly married) and The Persuaders (with future RCP drummer and co-founder Paul Speed). When River City People split, Maher teamed up with Debbi Peterson, drummer and vocalist with The Bangles, to form a duo called Kindred Spirit, who released a self-titled album in 1995. Although Peterson and Maher never officially split, Kindred Spirit is inactive. Peterson returned to the Bangles, and Maher released a solo album in 2002 called Immigrant Flower. Living in Nashville, Tennessee having married Ray Kennedy, producer of Steve Earle and Malcolm Holcombe, the country/folk/Americana influence on her music is noticeable. She now styles herself Siobhan Maher Kennedy. Other work In 1987 Maher played the part of Lettuce in the Brookside spin-off series Damon and Debbie. Maher also made forays into television presenting, on the 1987 series of the BBC1 fashion magazine programme The Clothes Show and the 1987 and 1988 seasons of But First This!, Children's BBC's summer holiday morning programme.

A MODIS image. In imaging spectroscopy (also hyperspectral imaging or spectral imaging) each pixel of an image acquires many bands of light intensity data from the spectrum, instead of just the three bands of the RGB color model. More precisely, it is the simultaneous acquisition of spatially coregistered images in many spectrally contiguous bands. Some spectral images contain only a few image planes of a spectral data cube, while others are better thought of as full spectra at every location in the image. For example, solar physicists use the spectroheliograph to make images of the Sun built up by scanning the slit of a spectrograph, to study the behavior of surface features on the Sun; such a spectroheliogram may have a spectral resolution of over 100,000 (\\\\lambda / \\\\Delta \\\\lambda) and be used to measure local motion (via the Doppler shift) and even the magnetic field (via the Zeeman splitting or Hanle effect) at each location in the image plane. The multispectral images collected by the Opportunity rover, in contrast, have only four wavelength bands and hence are only a little more than 3-color images. To be scientifically useful, such measurement should be done using an internationally recognized system of units. One application is spectral geophysical imaging, which allows quantitative and qualitative characterization of the surface and of the atmosphere, using radiometric measurements. These measurements can then be used for unambiguous direct and indirect identification of surface materials and atmospheric trace gases, the measurement of their relative concentrations, subsequently the assignment of the proportional contribution of mixed pixel signals (e.g., the spectral unmixing problem), the derivation of their spatial distribution (mapping problem), and finally their study over time (multi- temporal analysis). The Moon Mineralogy Mapper on Chandrayaan-1 was a geophysical imaging spectrometer.  Background  In 1704, Sir Isaac Newton demonstrated that white light could be split up into component colours. The subsequent history of spectroscopy led to precise measurements and provided the empirical foundations for atomic and molecular physics (Born & Wolf, 1999). Significant achievements in imaging spectroscopy are attributed to airborne instruments, particularly arising in the early 1980s and 1990s (Goetz et al., 1985; Vane et al., 1984). However, it was not until 1999 that the first imaging spectrometer was launched in space (the NASA Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, or MODIS). Terminology and definitions evolve over time. At one time, >10 spectral bands sufficed to justify the term \\"imaging spectrometer\\" but presently the term is seldom defined by a total minimum number of spectral bands, rather by a contiguous (or redundant) statement of spectral bands. The term hyperspectral imaging is sometimes used interchangeably with imaging spectroscopy. Due to its heavy use in military related applications, the civil world has established a slight preference for using the term imaging spectroscopy.  Unmixing  Hyperspectral data is often used to determine what materials are present in a scene. Materials of interest could include roadways, vegetation, and specific targets (i.e. pollutants, hazardous materials, etc.). Trivially, each pixel of a hyperspectral image could be compared to a material database to determine the type of material making up the pixel. However, many hyperspectral imaging platforms have low resolution (>5m per pixel) causing each pixel to be a mixture of several materials. The process of unmixing one of these 'mixed' pixels is called hyperspectral image unmixing or simply hyperspectral unmixing. = Models = A solution to hyperspectral unmixing is to reverse the mixing process. Generally, two models of mixing are assumed: linear and nonlinear. Linear mixing models the ground as being flat and incident sunlight on the ground causes the materials to radiate some amount of the incident energy back to the sensor. Each pixel then, is modeled as a linear sum of all the radiated energy curves of materials making up the pixel. Therefore, each material contributes to the sensor's observation in a positive linear fashion. Additionally, a conservation of energy constraint is often observed thereby forcing the weights of the linear mixture to sum to one in addition to being positive. The model can be described mathematically as follows: :p = A*x\\\\, where p represents a pixel observed by the sensor, A is a matrix of material reflectance signatures (each signature is a column of the matrix), and x is the proportion of material present in the observed pixel. This type of model is also referred to as a simplex. With x satisfying the two constraints: 1\\\\. Abundance Nonnegativity Constraint (ANC) - each element of x is positive. 2\\\\. Abundance Sum-to-one Constraint (ASC) - the elements of x must sum to one. Non-linear mixing results from multiple scattering often due to non-flat surface such as buildings and vegetation. =Unmixing (Endmember Detection) Algorithms= There are many algorithms to unmix hyperspectral data each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Many algorithms assume that pure pixels (pixels which contain only one materials) are present in a scene. Some algorithms to perform unmixing are listed below: * Pixel Purity Index Works by projecting each pixel onto one vector from a set of random vectors spanning the reflectance space. A pixel receives a score when it represent an extremum of all the projections. Pixels with the highest scores are deemed to be spectrally pure. * N-FINDR http://proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=994814 * Gift Wrapping Algorithm * Independent Component Analysis Endmember Extraction Algorithm (ICA-EEA) - Works by assuming that pure pixels occur independently than mixed pixels. Assumes pure pixels are present. * Vertex Component Analysis (VCA) - Works on the fact that the affine transformation of a simplex is another simplex which helps to find hidden (folded) vertices of the simplex. Assumes pure pixels are present. * Principal component analysis -(PCA) could also be used to determine endmembers, projection on principal axes could permit endmember selection [ Smith,Johnson et Adams (1985), Bateson et Curtiss (1996) ] * Multi Endmembers Spatial Mixture Analysis (MESMA) based on the SMA algorithm * Spectral Phasor Analysis (SPA) based on Fourier transformation of spectra and plotting them on a 2D plot. Non-linear unmixing algorithms also exist: support vector machines (SVM) or Analytical Neural Network (ANN). Probabilistic methods have also been attempted to unmix pixel through Monte Carlo Unmixing (MCU) algorithm. =Abundance Maps= Once the fundamental materials of a scene are determined, it is often useful to construct an abundance map of each material which displays the fractional amount of material present at each pixel. Often linear programming is done to observed ANC and ASC.

While the Dynabook was a concept for a transportable computer that was impossible to implement with available technology, the NoteTaker was intended to show what could be done. The computer employed what was then highly advanced technology, including a built- in monochrome display monitor, a floppy disk drive and a mouse. It had 256 kB of RAM, then a very large amount, and used a 5 MHz Intel 8086 CPU. It used a version of the Smalltalk operating system that was originally written for the Xerox Alto computer, which pioneered the graphical user interface. The NoteTaker fitted into a case similar in form to that of a portable sewing machine; the keyboard folded out from the bottom to reveal the monitor and floppy drive. The form factor was later used on the highly successful \\"luggable\\" computers, including the Osborne 1 and Compaq Portable. However, these later models were about half as heavy as the NoteTaker, which weighed 22 kg (48 lb).

Dick. The story is set in a future where the bulk of humanity is kept in large underground shelters. The people are told that World War III is being fought above them, when in reality the war ended years ago. The novel is based on Dick's 1953 short story \\"The Defenders\\". Dick also drew upon two other of his short stories for the plot of the novel: \\"The Mold of Yancy\\" and \\"The Unreconstructed M\\". Plot summary World War III begins early in the 21st century. It is fought between the two superpowers, West-Dem and Pac-Peop. The fighting is extensive and severe, most of it performed by \\"leadies\\", robots built to withstand the most extreme circumstances. The Earth becomes a battlefield. Unable to exist in the atmosphere created by robot war, vast \\"ant tanks\\" are constructed underground to save the diminishing human population. The government and war engine remains on the surface; the elite \\"Yance-men\\". Their president, Talbot Yancy, delivers inspirational speeches to the tankers, motivating them to increase their production of leadies and win the war. The war does eventually end. However, the Yance-men design a conspiracy to maintain the wealth of the Earth for themselves. Yancy continues to describe devastation in televised speeches. The tankers continue to produce leadies. Talbot Yancy is actually a computer generated simulacrum. The Yance-men program him from the \\"Agency\\" in New York. They live in immense villas on private parks, called \\"demesnes\\". The leadies are actually used by the Yance- men as personal servants and to maintain their estates. The Agency is run by the most vicious and greedy Yance-man, Stanton Brose, who is kept alive by pre-war artificial organs which he hoards. The story begins in one of the tanks, named Tom Mix (named after the actor Tom Mix). The tank president, Nicholas St. James, is forced to go to the surface to buy an artificial pancreas on the black market. He emerges on David Lantano's property (a Yance- man). When some of Lantano's leadies try to kill St. James, they are destroyed by a mysterious man who looks like Talbot Yancy. St. James wanders around, through the ruins of a war, and eventually ends up at Lantano's mansion. Simultaneously, Joseph Adams (another Yance-man) is put on a special mission by Brose. He must plant evidence of alien artifacts on land belonging to a real-estate agent (Louis Runcible) so the land can be legitimately seized. The artifacts are buried using a time travel device. One by one, the people attached to this project are killed. Adams fearfully retreats to Lantano's mansion. Another person to appear in the mansion is Webster Foote, the owner and operator of a private detective corporation. Foote accepts work on a per- case basis from everybody (including Brose, Lantano and Runcible) but wishes to save Runcible from the plot against him. Lantano then reveals to Foote, Adams and St. James, that he is a Cherokee from the distant past, somehow being given extended life by the time travel device that placed the artifacts back in time. He has lived through history, taking many positions of note under different names, and now he has killed the members of this special project. Lantano, Foote, and Adams together now plot to kill Brose and free the people underground. However, Adams figures out Lantano was behind the deaths as part of his plot to bring down Brose. In desperation and fear, he joins up with St. James, who discovered a cache of artificial organs, and flees into the Tom Mix tank with him. They discover that Lantano was ultimately successful but contemplate that the biggest lie is yet to come.

The Scottish engineer for the roof was John Scott Russell who used 4,000 tons of steel with no ties. The central building of the World Fair was accepted enthusiastically by the public. It was used for shows and fairs later on. Alexander Girardi performed a concert in this hall. In 1898 a \\"Collektivausstellung österreichischer Automobilbauer\\" (Collective Exhibition of Austrian Carbuilders) was shown during the \\"Kaiser Franz Joseph Jubiläumsausstellung\\" (Emperor Franz Joseph Jubilee-Exhibition).

A form constant is one of several geometric patterns which are recurringly observed during hypnagogia, hallucinations and altered states of consciousness. History In 1926, Heinrich Klüver systematically studied the effects of mescaline (peyote) on the subjective experiences of its users. In addition to producing hallucinations characterized by bright, \\"highly saturated\\" colors and vivid imagery, Klüver noticed that mescaline produced recurring geometric patterns in different users. He called these patterns \\"form constants\\" and categorized four types: lattices (including honeycombs, checkerboards, and triangles), cobwebs, tunnels, and spirals. In 1988 David Lewis-Williams and T.A. Dowson incorporated the form constant into their Three Stages of Trance model, the geometric shapes comprising the visuals observed in the model's first stage. Precipitants Klüver's form constants have appeared in other drug-induced and naturally occurring hallucinations, suggesting a similar physiological process underlying hallucinations with different triggers. Klüver's form constants also appear in near-death experiences and sensory experiences of those with synesthesia. Other triggers include psychological stress, threshold consciousness (hypnagogia), insulin hypoglycemia, the delirium of fever, epilepsy, psychotic episodes, advanced syphilis, sensory deprivation, photostimulation, electrical stimulation, crystal gazing, migraine headaches, dizziness and a variety of drug-induced intoxications. These shapes may appear on their own or with eyes shut in the form of phosphenes, especially when exerting pressure against the closed eyelid. It is believed that the reason why these form constants appear has to do with the way the visual system is organized, and in particular in the mapping between patterns on the retina and the columnar organization of the primary visual cortex. Concentric circles in the retina are mapped into parallel lines in the visual cortex. Spirals, tunnels, lattices and cobwebs map into lines in different directions. This means that if activation spreads in straight lines within the visual cortex, the experience is equivalent to looking at actual form constants. Author Michael Moorcock once observed in print that the shapes he had seen during his migraine headaches resembled exactly the form of fractals. The diversity of conditions that provoke such patterns suggests that form constants reflect some fundamental property of visual perception. Cultural significance Form constants have a relationship to some forms of abstract art, especially the visual music tradition, as William Wees noted in his book Light Moving in Time about research done by German psychologist Heinrich Klüver on the form constants resulting from mescal intoxication. The visual and synaesthetic hallucinations this drug produced resembles, as Wees noted, a listing of visual forms employed in visual music: These form-constants provide links between abstraction, visual music and synaesthesia. The cultural significance of form constants, as Wees notes in Light Moving in Time is part of the history of abstract film and video. The practice of the ancient art of divination may suggest a deliberate practice of cultivating form constant imagery and using intuition and/or imagination to derive some meaning from transient visual phenomena. Psychedelic art, inspired at least in part by experiences with psychedelic substances, frequently includes repetitive abstract forms and patterns such as tessellation, Moiré patterns or patterns similar to those created by paper marbling, and, in later years, fractals. The op art genre of visual art created art using bold imagery very like that of form constants. In electroacoustic music, Jon Weinel has explored the use of altered states of consciousness as a basis for the design of musical compositions. His work bases the design of sonic materials on typical features of hallucinatory states, and organises them according to hallucinatory narratives. As part of this work, form constants feature prominently as a basis for the design of psychedelic sonic and visual material.Weinel, J. \\"Visual patterns of hallucination as a basis for sonic arts composition\\".

From that time, the Romanian Communist Party started a campaign of secularization, seeking to transform the country into an atheist state along Marxist-Leninist lines. Beginning with the 1989 revolution, the legally recognized churches, especially the Romanian Orthodox Church, the country’s largest religious group, pressured the post- communist authorities to introduce religious education in public schools, offer substantial financial support for theological institutions and allow denominations to resume their social role by posting clergy in hospitals, elderly care homes and prisons. Although education was an area where churches registered success in the early stages of post-communist transition, religious education remains a low priority in Romania. Religious education under communism Shortly after 1945, religious education came under the scrutiny of communist authorities and the Securitate. The Department of Religious Denominations, a governmental body dealing with religious matters since pre- communist times, continued to exist but was transformed into an agency enforcing stricter state control over religious affairs in the country. Recently it was revealed that the Securitate included a special department supervising religious life that tried to solve the so-called problem of the denominations, especially religious groups and individuals hostile to the new regime. Post-communist developments After decades of officially-backed atheism, one of the first demands churches in that country put forth after December 1989 was the resumption of pre-university religious education in public schools. In January 1990, less than a month after communist leader Ceauşescu was killed by a firing squad and well before post-communist authorities had time to revamp the education system, the new Secretary of State for Religious Denominations, Nicolae Stoicescu, together with the Romanian Orthodox Church’s collective leadership structure, the Holy Synod, pledged their support for the introduction of religious education in public schools at all pre-university levels. An optional religion class, for which students were not to be graded, was to be included in the pre-university curriculum, with students declaring their religious affiliation in consultation with their parents. Students who were atheist or non-religious had the opportunity to opt out of the classes. The Romanian Senate discussed the bill on 13 June 1995 in the presence of then Minister of Education Liviu Maior (representing the Social Democrats), with much of the discussion centering on Article 9, which recognized religion as a school subject. First, Gheorghe Dumitrescu, who sat on the parliamentary commission on education proposed that Article 9 read: \\"Mandatory school curricula include religion as a school subject. The study of religion is mandatory in primary school and optional in secondary school, the optional subject being ethics. The study of religion is also optional, depending on the religion and denomination of each student.\\" One change has been the reorganization of religious education, mainly in primary schools. Romania officially has more than 86% Christian Orthodox believers. Another 6% percent belong to the Catholic Church and 3% are Protestant churches. Muslims and Jews constitute less than 1% and have also started to implement their religious education in schools. In Romanian society, the number of people without any belief (unbaptized and not having been married in a religious setting) is very low, under 0.1%. Nowadays, national polls show Romanian Orthodox Church to be one of the most trusted institutions in Romania. At this moment there are over 10,000 qualified teachers in public schools and the number is not enough. Their enthusiasm had provided a good assistance to people who were deprived by religious education for decades. Despite a shortage of qualified teachers in religion, many priests and students in theology accomplished in a successful way. The Romanian Orthodox Church has 37 high schools (seminaries) and, in higher education, 12 faculties of theology with over 9,400 undergraduate students specialized in Priesthood, School, Social Services and Sacred Arts. Under the 1995 and 2011 education laws, students were to attend religious classes by default, and those who wished to opt out of them could only do so through a written request to the school director. The National Council for Combating Discrimination criticized this as an infringement on children's freedom of conscience. On 12 November 2014, the relevant articles of law were ruled unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court of Romania, effectively abolishing the de facto compulsory religious education in Romania. The Romanian Orthodox Church protested against the ruling, claiming it is a \\"humiliation\\" for religious education, however it has no means to challenge the decision.

Béchamp developed the Béchamp reduction, an inexpensive method to produce aniline dye, permitting William Henry Perkin to launch the synthetic-dye industry. Béchamp also synthesized the first organic arsenical drug, arsanilic acid, from which Paul Ehrlich later synthesized salvarsan, the first chemotherapeutic drug. Béchamp's rivalry with Pasteur was initially for priority in attributing fermentation to microorganisms, later for attributing the silkworm disease pebrine to microorganisms, and eventually over the validity of germ theory. Béchamp also disputed cell theory. Claiming discovery that the \\"molecular granulations\\" in biological fluids were actually the elementary units of life, Béchamp named them microzymas—that is, \\"tiny enzymes\\"—and credited them with producing both enzymes and cells while \\"evolving\\" amid favorable conditions into multicellular organisms. Denying that bacteria could invade a healthy animal and cause disease, Béchamp claimed instead that unfavorable host and environmental conditions destabilize the host's native microzymas, whereupon they decompose host tissue by producing pathogenic bacteria. While cell theory and germ theory gained widespread acceptance, granular theories became obscure. Béchamp's version, microzymian theory, has been retained by small groups, especially in alternative medicine.  Life and career  Béchamp was born in Bassing, France in 1816, the son of a miller. He lived in Bucharest, Romania from the ages of 7 to 18 with an uncle who worked in the French ambassador's office. He was educated at the University of Strasbourg, receiving a doctor of science degree in 1853 and doctor of medicine in 1856, and ran a pharmacy in the city. In 1854 was appointed Professor of Chemistry at the University of Strasbourg, a post previously held by Louis Pasteur. In 1856, after receiving his medical degree, Béchamp took a position at the University of Montpellier, where he remained until 1876 when he was appointed Dean of the Catholic Faculty of Medicine at Université Lille Nord de France. Béchamp's time in Lille was stormy, as his dispute with Pasteur led to efforts to have his work placed on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum (the index of books prohibited by the Catholic Church). Béchamp retired under this cloud in 1886, briefly ran a pharmacy with his son, and ultimately moved to Paris, where he was given a small laboratory at the Sorbonne. One of his students was Victor Galippe, a physician who studied micro-organisms in plants and their role in human health. He died at the age of 91, his work having faded into scientific obscurity and Pasteur's version of germ theory dominant. A brief obituary in the British Medical Journal noted that Béchamp's name was \\"associated with bygone controversies as to priority which it would be unprofitable to recall.\\" In the modern day, Béchamp's work continues to be promoted by a small group of alternative medicine proponents (also known as germ theory denialists), including advocates of alternative theories of cancer, who dismiss Pasteur's germ theory and argue that Béchamp's ideas were unjustly ignored. They accuse Pasteur, as did The French Academy of Sciences, of plagiarising and then suppressing Béchamp's work, citing work such as Ethel Douglas Hume's Béchamp or Pasteur: A Lost Chapter in the History of Biology from the 1920s.

It was masterminded by Charles the Bold, Count of Charolais, son of the Duke of Burgundy, with the king's brother Charles, Duke of Berry, as a figurehead.  Background  In keeping with the policies of previous Capetian and Valois monarchs, Louis asserted the supremacy of the king within the territory of France. Over the course of the preceding centuries, and during the Hundred Years' War, the French kings effected an administrative unification of the country. Unlike Germany, which languished as a miscellany of feudal factions, France emerged from the Middle Ages as a centralized state. But this centralization was opposed by the League of Public Weal, whose nobles sought to restore their feudal prerogatives.Paul Murray Kendall, Louis XI: The Universal Spider (New York: W. W.

Charles the Bold, as heir to the duke of Burgundy, whose fiefs in France included Flanders, and who held the Imperial lands of Holland and Brabant, sought to make the Duchy of Burgundy independent of the French throne. He aspired to forge it into a kingdom of his own between France and Germany, stretching between the North Sea on the north and the Jura Mountains on the south; and from the Somme River on the west to the Moselle River on the east.

Members of the League  The League's members included: * 30px Charles, Duke of Berry, the king's teenage brother * 30px John II, Duke of Bourbon * 30px Charles, Count of Charolais, son and heir of the elderly Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy * 30px Francis II, Duke of Brittany * 30px John II, Duke of Lorraine, titular Duke of Calabria * 30px Jacques d'Armagnac, Duke of Nemours * 30px John V, Count of Armagnac * 30px Louis de Luxembourg, Count of Saint Pol * 30px John, Count of Dunois, the illegitimate brother of the Duke of Orléans * 30px Antoine de Chabannes, Count of Dammartin * 30px Charles II, Count of Albret * 30px Pierre d'Amboise * 30px John I, Duke of Cleves * 30px André de Lohéac * 30px Frederick I, Elector Palatine  War of the Public Weal  To defend himself, Louis XI allied with Francesco Sforza, Duke of Milan, and the people of Liège. The king was also supported by the following princes of the blood: * 30px René, Duke of Anjou, titular King of Naples * 30px Charles of Anjou, Count of Maine * 30px John of Burgundy, Count of Nevers * 30px John of Bourbon, Count of Vendome * 30px Charles of Artois, Count of Eu Louis XI, who enjoyed the effective support of Gaston IV, Count of Foix, had an army of 30,000 men. At the beginning of hostilities in May and June 1465, he attacked the Bourbonnais center of the country. Then he began a race to the capital against the Breton and Burgundian armies. Before they joined forces, the king decided to confront the Burgundian army led by the Count of Charolais. The Battle of Montlhéry was fought on 16 July 1465 in the vicinity of Longpont- sur-Orge, south of Paris. The events of the battle are confused. Both parties claimed the victory. The Count of Charolais remained master of the field. But Louis XI reduced the Burgundian army, then cautiously ordered a strategic retreat during the night, and returned to Paris with a \\"victorious\\" army (although his uncle the Count of Maine had fled the battlefield with a third of the royal troops). The king strengthened the capital's faltering authority. However, the king's position weakened after the confrontation, especially as he was unable to prevent the junction, on 19 July, of the Burgundian and Breton armies, soon joined by the Counts of Armagnac and Albret and the Duke of Lorraine. After entering Paris on 18 July, Louis XI organized the defense. The feudal princes besieged Paris. Louis XI left the city on 10 August. He went to Rouen and rallied the royal party, assembled provisions, and returned to Paris on 28 August, with powerful reinforcements. A truce was signed on September 3, which did not prevent the Leaguers from taking Pontoise and Rouen. Fighters on both sides did not quite know how to end the conflict. Louis XI pretended to yield.  Peace  Louis XI signed three peace treaties: *5 October 1465: Treaty of Conflans with the Count of Charolais and Charles of FranceAlexander Gillespie, The Causes of War: Volume III: 1400 CE to 1650 CE, (Hart Publishing, 2017), 26. *29 October 1465: Treaty of Saint-Maur with individual princes *23 December 1465: Treaty of Caen with the Duke Francis II of Brittany = Concessions = *Charles of France, Duke of Berry, received the Duchy of Normandy *Charles of Burgundy, Count of Charolais received for himself and his next heir the towns of the Somme, after which they could be redeemed for 200,000 crowns (Louis XI had already redeemed these lands from Charles' father, the Duke of Burgundy, for 400,000 crowns), and estates at Boulogne, Guines, Roye, Peronne and Montdidier *John of Anjou, Duke of Lorraine, the towns of Mouzon, St. Menehould and Neufchâteau *Francis, Duke of Brittany, gained Montfort and Étampes, and the regale in all his demesnes *John, Duke of Bourbon, gained Donchery, several lordships in Auvergne, 300 lances, and 100,000 crowns *Jacques of Armagnac, Duke of Nemours, received the government of Paris and the Île-de-France *John, Count of Armagnac, gained various castellanies at Rouergue *Tanneguy du Chastel was made equerry *Louis of Luxembourg, Count of Saint-Pol, was made constable, etc. *A committee of 36 members, led by Dunois, was to reform the abuses of government. Louis XI did not observe the conditions for long.  Aftermath  Louis XI forgave some of the rebels, but some were also punished: *John II, Duke of Bourbon was appointed Constable of France in 1483; *Louis XI ravaged the castle of Chaumont of Pierre d'Amboise to punish the Amboise family for supporting the League of Public Good. The king pardoned them four years later and even provided some of the funds needed for reconstruction of Chaumont; *In 1465, Charles de Melun, governor of Paris and the Bastille, succeeded De la Rivière. Convicted for having links with the leaders of the League of Public Weal, he was executed in 1468 in Andelys. His property was confiscated and given to Antoine de Chabannes; *In March 1466, Charles of France, already struggling with the Duke of Brittany, cannot deal with Louis XI and lost Normandy. He fled to the court of Brittany; *Jacques of Armagnac, Duke of Nemours and Count of La Marche, had been pardoned by the king several times. In 1475, indignant at a new treason, he besieged and took the castle of Carlat. The duke was imprisoned at the Bastille, tried and beheaded in the public square in Paris in 1477. In 1468, Charles the Bold formed a new league with Charles of France, Duke John of Alençon and Francis II, Duke of Brittany, with the support of Edward IV of England. But Louis XI was strongly supported by the States General at Tours in April, and succeeded in separating Francis II and Charles of France from the Leaguers (Treaty of Ancenis).  Results  Both Charles and Louis were prone to overreaching themselves, and Louis's machinations nearly resulted in military defeat at Charles's hands. However, insurrections in his newly acquired territories of Lorraine and Switzerland weakened Charles's efforts. Charles himself was killed in the Battle of Nancy against the Swiss, and Louis was saved from his greatest adversary. He had already taken his revenge on Charles's allies within France. The great duchy of Burgundy was then absorbed into the kingdom of France. The League of the Public Weal was routed in its every objective.

While Nixon's actions did not formally abolish the existing Bretton Woods system of international financial exchange, the suspension of one of its key components effectively rendered the Bretton Woods system inoperative. While Nixon publicly stated his intention to resume direct convertibility of the dollar after reforms to the Bretton Woods system had been implemented, all attempts at reform proved unsuccessful. By 1973, the Bretton Woods system was replaced de facto by the current regime based on freely floating fiat currencies. Background In 1944, representatives from 44 nations met in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire to develop a new international monetary system that came to be known as the Bretton Woods system. Conference attendees had hoped that this new system would \\"ensure exchange rate stability, prevent competitive devaluations, and promote economic growth\\". It was not until 1958 that the Bretton Woods system became fully operational. Countries now settled their international accounts in dollars that could be converted to gold at a fixed exchange rate of $35 per ounce, which was redeemable by the U.S. government. Thus, the United States was committed to backing every dollar overseas with gold, and other currencies were pegged to the dollar. For the first years after World War II, the Bretton Woods system worked well. With the Marshall Plan, Japan and Europe were rebuilding from the war, and countries outside the US wanted dollars to spend on American goods—cars, steel, machinery, etc. Because the U.S. owned over half the world's official gold reserves—574 million ounces at the end of World War II—the system appeared secure. However, from 1950 to 1969, as Germany and Japan recovered, the US share of the world's economic output dropped significantly, from 35% to 27%. Furthermore, a negative balance of payments, growing public debt incurred by the Vietnam War, and monetary inflation by the Federal Reserve caused the dollar to become increasingly overvalued in the 1960s. In France, the Bretton Woods system was called \\"America's exorbitant privilege\\"Barry Eichengreen, Exorbitant Privilege: The Rise and Fall of the Dollar and the Future of the International monetary system as it resulted in an \\"asymmetric financial system\\" where non- US citizens \\"see themselves supporting American living standards and subsidizing American multinationals\\". As American economist Barry Eichengreen summarized: \\"It costs only a few cents for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing to produce a $100 bill, but other countries had to pony up $100 of actual goods in order to obtain one\\". In February 1965 President Charles de Gaulle announced his intention to exchange its U.S. dollar reserves for gold at the official exchange rate.Margaret Garritsen de Vries, The International Monetary Fund, 1966–1971 By 1966, non-US central banks held $14 billion, while the United States had only $13.2 billion in gold reserve. Of those reserves, only $3.2 billion was able to cover foreign holdings as the rest was covering domestic holdings. By 1971, the money supply had increased by 10%. In May 1971, West Germany left the Bretton Woods system, unwilling to revalue the Deutsche Mark. In the following three months, this move strengthened its economy. Simultaneously, the dollar dropped 7.5% against the Deutsche Mark. Other nations began to demand redemption of their dollars for gold. Switzerland redeemed $50 million in July. France acquired $191 million in gold. On August 5, 1971, the United States Congress released a report recommending devaluation of the dollar, in an effort to protect the dollar against \\"foreign price-gougers\\". On August 9, 1971, as the dollar dropped in value against European currencies, Switzerland left the Bretton Woods system. The pressure began to intensify on the United States to leave Bretton Woods. Event At the time, the U.S. also had an unemployment rate of 6.1% (August 1971) To compare over the period from 1950–2013 from the same Bureau of Statistics Unemployment rate data, in the United States unemployment rates rose to highs of 10.8% in November 1982 and 10% in October 2009; and dropped to lows of 2.5% in May, 1953; 3.9% in September, 2000; 4.4% in May, 2007; 5% in March 1989; 7.7% in July 1992; 7.9% in October, 1949; 7.4% in August 1958. and an inflation rate of 5.84% (1971). To combat these problems, President Nixon consulted Federal Reserve chairman Arthur Burns, incoming Treasury Secretary John Connally, and then Undersecretary for International Monetary Affairs and future Fed Chairman Paul Volcker. On the afternoon of Friday, August 13, 1971, these officials along with twelve other high-ranking White House and Treasury advisors met secretly with Nixon at Camp David. There was great debate about what Nixon should do, but ultimately Nixon, relying heavily on the advice of the self-confident Connally, decided to break up Bretton Woods by announcing the following actions on August 15:Richard Nixon, \\"Address to the Nation Outlining a New Economic Policy: 'The Challenge of Peace.'\\" (August 15, 1971) # Nixon directed Treasury Secretary Connally to suspend, with certain exceptions, the convertibility of the dollar into gold or other reserve assets, ordering the gold window to be closed such that foreign governments could no longer exchange their dollars for gold. # Nixon issued (pursuant to the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970), imposing a 90-day freeze on wages and prices in order to counter inflation. This was the first time the U.S. government had enacted wage and price controls since World War II. # An import surcharge of 10 percent was set to ensure that American products would not be at a disadvantage because of the expected fluctuation in exchange rates. Speaking on television on Sunday, August 15, when American financial markets were closed, Nixon said the following: The American public believed the government was rescuing them from price gougers and from a foreign-caused exchange crisis.Hetzel, Robert L. (2008), p. 84 cited in Politically, Nixon's actions were a great success. The Dow rose 33 points the next day, its biggest daily gain ever at that point, and the New York Times editorial read, \\"We unhesitatingly applaud the boldness with which the President has moved.\\"Nicky Marsh, Credit Culture: The Politics of Money in the American Novel of the 1970s (2000) pp. 52–53. By December 1971, the import surcharge was dropped as part of a general revaluation of the Group of Ten (G-10) currencies, which under the Smithsonian Agreement were thereafter allowed 2.25% devaluations from the agreed exchange rate. In March 1973, the fixed exchange rate system became a floating exchange rate system. in The currency exchange rates no longer were governments' principal means of administering monetary policy. Later ramifications The Nixon Shock has been widely considered to be a political success, but an economic mixed bag in bringing on the stagflation of the 1970s and leading to the instability of floating currencies. The dollar plunged by a third during the 1970s. According to the World Trade Review's report \\"The Nixon Shock After Forty Years: The Import Surcharge Revisited\\", Douglas Irwin reports that for several months, U.S officials could not get other countries to agree to a formal revaluation of their currencies. The German Mark appreciated significantly after it was allowed to float in May 1971. Further, the Nixon Shock unleashed enormous speculation against the dollar. It forced Japan's central bank to intervene significantly in the foreign exchange market to prevent the yen from increasing in value. Within two days August 16–17, 1971, Japan's central bank had to buy $1.3 billion to support the dollar and keep the yen at the old rate of ¥360 to the dollar. Japan's foreign exchange reserves rapidly increased: $2.7 billion (30%) a week later and $4 billion the following week. Still, this large-scale intervention by Japan's central bank could not prevent the depreciation of US dollar against the yen. France also was willing to allow the dollar to depreciate against the franc, but not allow the franc to appreciate against gold (Page 14 Douglas). Even much later, in 2011, Paul Volcker expressed regret over the abandonment of Bretton Woods: \\"Nobody's in charge,\\" Volcker said. \\"The Europeans couldn't live with the uncertainty and made their own currency and now that's in trouble.\\" Debates over the Nixon Shock have persisted to the present day, with economists and politicians across the political spectrum trying to make sense of the Nixon Shock and its impact on monetary policy in the light of the financial crisis of 2007–2008.

Description With long- tailed hoods it includes in particular a chaperon or gugel, or the peak of a shoe. A graffito on the church wall of Swannington Church in Norfolk depicts a \\"late medieval woman wearing a long, laced gown and hood with a long liripipe ornament.\\"The Norfolk Medieval Graffiti Survey, The Guardian, March 29, 2014, article by Matt Champion In modern times, liripipe mostly refers to the tail of the cowl of an academic hood, seen at graduation ceremonies. Liripipe was popular from the mid-14th to the end of the 15th century. 'Liripipe', and the phrase 'liripipe hood', which are often used by costume historians, are not medieval words but scholarly adoptions dating to the early modern period to describe a fashion which appears very often in medieval art, in the form of a long extension to a hood. It could be worn hanging down, or, by the 15th century, is depicted wrapped round the head or the neck. Origins The word is believed to originate from the Medieval Latin term ', which is of unsure origin. Webster's Dictionary suggests it is a corruption of ' (\\"clergy's tippet\\"), but this is uncertain. The Oxford English Dictionary, attributing the hypothesis to Gilles Ménage, calls it a \\"ludicrous guess\\".: \\"No plausible etymology has been found [...] Ménage's ludicrous guess, that ' is a corruption of ', is repeated seriously in recent \\" Perhaps due to its academic association, the word has the obsolete sense of \\"part or lesson committed to memory\\", as in the expressions \\"to know one's liripipe\\" and \\"to teach someone his liripipe\\".  Fashion  Liripipe often appears in text as implicit criticism of absurd or exaggerated fashion: in the 1360s the author of the Chronicle Eulogium Historiarum sive Temporis mentions liripipes that hang right down to the heels like ridiculous strips ('liripipia usque talum longa modo fatuorum dilacerata') or worn tied round the head by cross-dressing women. The term was also applied to exaggerated toes on shoes, according to a 14th-century statute of Oxford University.

Her skill as a drummer earned her a \\"May I recommend?\\" nod from Bob Dylan on his XM Theme Time Radio Hour program (episode 37) in January 2007. Linna is part of the collective of musicians that emerged from the Cleveland, Ohio punk rock scene, including the Dead Boys and Pere Ubu. When the re-formed Rocket from the Tombs performed in Hoboken, New Jersey in 2003, singer David Thomas dedicated the band's signature song \\"Amphetamine\\" to her.

Linna left The Cramps to join the rock and roll band Nervus Rex. After performing with the Zantees, Linna and Miller launched The A-Bones (named after a 1964 tune by The Trashmen). The A-Bones released two 10\\" EPs (Tempo Tantrum in 1986 and Free Beer for Life! in 1988), followed by four full-length albums between 1991 and 1996.

It was designed by New Haven architect Richard Williams in the Classical Revival style, and was completed in 1903. The building was a gift to the city from Augusta Munson Curtis in honor of her husband George, who was one of the city's leading businessmen and onetime mayor. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981. Description and history The Curtis Cultural Center is located in the historic civic center of Meriden, set on a knoll at the southeast corner of East Main and Pleasant Streets. It is a two- story masonry structure, built out of white Vermont marble. It presents as a single-story structure, with the second floor only evident due to a high parapet above the main cornice. A copper dome is placed at the center of the cruciform structure. The front projection houses the main entrance, which is deeply recessed in an opening that has flanking pilasters and two fluted Ionic columns set in antis. The interior retains many original features, including mosaic tile flooring, a red marble fireplace, and Corinthian columns supporting the dome. Meriden's first library was established in 1898 by the Thursday Morning Club, an association of local women, and was kept in a private home. In 1900 August Munson Curtis offered to buy land and fund construction of a dedicated building. This building was completed in 1903, and was dedicated in honor of Curtis' daughter Agnes and husband George; he was a prominent industrial executive and also served as mayor of the city. The building remained in use as a library until 1974, when new facility was opened on Miller Street. This building was then repurposed by the city as an arts and cultural center, named in honor of its benefactor.

It is near the сonfluence of the Tisa and Rika Rivers. Serving as the administrative center of Khust Raion (district), the city itself does not belong to the raion and is designated as a city of oblast significance, with the status equal to that of a raion. Population: Khust was the capital of the short-lived republic of Carpatho- Ukraine. Origin of name The name is most possibly related to the name of the stream Hustets or Husztica, whose meaning is \\"kerchief\\". It is also conceivable that the name of the city comes from a Romanian traditional food ingredient – husti. There are several alternative names used for this city: Ukrainian /Rusyn: Хуст, Romanian: Hust, Hungarian: Huszt, Czech and Slovak: Chust, , . There is also one fairy tale about the town's name: Once a chort was walking around the town and then mountain had appeared. A moment later, it fell down on his tail. He shouted, Hvust (Transcarpathian dialect, “Хвіст” in Ukrainian, tail in English). Another chort heard \\"Khust\\" … In that way, the name of the town was formed. History The settlement was first mentioned as terra Huzth, in 1324. Its castle, supposed to be built in 1090 by king St. Ladislaus of Hungary as a defence against the Cumans and destroyed during the Mongol invasion of Hungary, was mentioned in 1353. The town got privileges in 1329. In 1458 King Matthias imprisoned his uncle, the rebellious Mihály Szilágyi in the castle. In 1514, during György Dózsa's peasant revolt local peasants captured the castle. In 1526 the area became a part of Transylvania. The army of Ferdinand I captured the town in 1546. In 1594 the Tartars destroyed the town, but could not take the castle. The castle was besieged in 1644 by the army of George I Rákóczi, in 1657 by the Polish, in 1661–62 by the Ottoman and Tartar hordes. Count Ferenc Rhédey, the ruling prince of Transylvania and high steward of Máramaros county died in the castle on May 13, 1667. The castle surrendered to the Kurucs on August 17, 1703, and the independence of Transylvania was proclaimed here. It was the last castle the Habsburgs occupied when suppressing the freedom fight of the Kurucs, in 1711. The seriously damaged castle was struck by lightning and burnt down on July 3, 1766; a storm brought down its tower in 1798, it has been in ruins ever since then. Khust was renamed as Csebreny in 1882 during Magyarization process. In 1861, Rabbi Moshe Schick, established what was, at that time, the largest yeshiva in the world, with over 800 students. In 1910 Khust had 10,292 citizens, 5,230 Ruthenians, 3,505 Hungarians and 1,535 Germans. Until the Treaty of Trianon it belonged to Hungary and was the seat of the Khust district of Máramaros county. After World War I, in summer 1919 the Rumanian troops took over the territory. But according to the St.-Germain treaty Czechoslovakia received the city, as part of newly formed Podkarpatsko (\\"under the Carpathians\\") region (Subcarpathia).PRECLÍK, Vratislav: \\"Profesor Masaryk a Podkarpatská Rus právě před sto lety\\" (Professor Masaryk and Subcarpatian Russia just hundred years ago), in Čas: časopis Masarykova demokratického hnutí, leden - březen 2019, roč.XXVII. čís. 125. ISSN 1210-1648, str.18 – 23 Czechoslovakia had to provide the region a wide autonomy, but autonomy was realised only in 1938. In Autumn 1938 an autonomous government was organised. The day after the collapse of Czechoslovakia on March 14, 1939, the Khust city government proclaimed, by the will of the local population, independence as Carpathian Ukraine on March 15, 1939. Next day, on March 16, 1939, Hungarian troops invaded Khust and claimed it as part of Hungary. On October 24, 1944, Soviet troops occupied the city, and annexed it into the Soviet Union. The Soviet government deported much of the city's German and Hungarian populations. =WWII and the Holocaust= Holocaust Victims Memorial (Holon, Israel) Prior to 1939, Jews thrived in Khust and owned many businesses. When the city became part of Hungary in March 1939 again, many Jewish citizens were forced into labor camps. A ghetto was established, and Jews from other regions were forced to live there.

He previously worked for The New York Times and before that for Los Angeles Times. He has written or co-written many articles concerning U.S. government activities and is the author or co-author of two books about the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and a book about the American public debate about abortion. Risen is a Pulitzer Prize winner. Background Risen was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, and grew up in Bethesda, Maryland. He graduated from Brown University (1977) and received a Master's degree in Journalism at Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism (1978). He is currently an investigative reporter for The Intercept. Risen won the 2006 Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting for his stories about President George W. Bush's warrantless wiretapping program. He was a member of The New York Times reporting team that won the 2002 Pulitzer Prize for explanatory reporting for coverage of the September 11th attacks and terrorism. He was also a member of The New York Times reporting team that was a finalist for the 1999 Pulitzer Prize for international reporting, for coverage of the 1998 bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa. Risen has written four books: Wrath of Angels: The American Abortion War (Basic Books) (Judy Thomas, co-author) (1998); The Main Enemy: The Inside Story of the CIA's Final Showdown with the KGB (Random House) (Milt Bearden, co-author) (2003); State of War: The Secret History of the CIA and the Bush Administration (The Free Press) (2006); and Pay Any Price: Greed, Power, and Endless War (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt) (2014). State of War was a New York Times bestseller. Pay Any Price was also a New York Times bestseller. The Main Enemy was awarded the 2003 Cornelius Ryan Award for \\"best nonfiction book on international affairs\\" by the Overseas Press Club of America.  Reports on government surveillance programs  In 2004 Risen came upon information about the National Security Agency's surveillance of international communications originating or terminating in the United States, code-named \\"Stellar Wind\\". He and Eric Lichtblau, who had obtained similar information, co-wrote a story about \\"Stellar Wind\\" just before the 2004 United States presidential election. Risen said the New York Times spiked the story at the request of the White House. The two reporters rewrote and resubmitted the story a number of times after the election but were rejected each time. Risen decided to publish the information in a book along with information about the CIA's Operation Merlin. He warned the paper about the book and suggested it publish the information itself. Bill Keller, Executive editor of the New York Times, and Philip Taubman, Washington Bureau chief, were furious with Risen. Keller and Taubman negotiated with the Bush administration and, after a delay, the paper published much of Risen and Lichtblau's report about \\"Stellar Wind\\" in December 2005. Risen's book, titled State of War: The Secret History of the CIA and the Bush Administration, was published in January 2006. Risen and Eric Lichtblau were awarded the 2006 Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting for the series of controversial investigative reports that they co- wrote about \\"Stellar Wind\\" and about a government program called Terrorist Finance Tracking Program designed to detect terrorist financiers, which involved searches of money transfer records in the international SWIFT database. State of War Pay Any Price: Greed, Power, and Endless War at the Miller Center in Charlottesville, Virginia. Risen is the author of the book State of War: The Secret History of the CIA and the Bush Administration (January 2006). The book conducted important investigations into Central Intelligence Agency activities. It states that the CIA carried out an operation in 2000 (Operation Merlin) intended to delay Iran's alleged nuclear weapons program by feeding it flawed blueprints for key missing components—which backfired and may actually have aided Iran, as the flaw was likely detected and corrected by a former Soviet nuclear scientist the operation used to make the delivery. In early 2003, The New York Times refrained from publication of the story after an intervention by National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice with the NYT Executive Editor Howell Raines. While doing research for the book, Risen's email and phone connections with former CIA Operations Officer Jeffrey Alexander Sterling were monitored by the US federal government. The US federal government also obtained Risen's credit and bank records. The CIA Public Affairs Office issued a press release alleging that Risen's book contains serious errors in every chapter. However, CIA documents released in January 2015 confirm many details on Operation Merlin. Risen writes in State of War that, \\"Several of the Iranian [CIA] agents were arrested and jailed, while the fate of some of the others is still unknown\\", after a CIA official in 2004 sent an Iranian agent an encrypted electronic message, mistakenly including data that could potentially identify \\"virtually every spy the CIA had inside Iran\\". The Iranian was a double agent and handed over the information to Iranian intelligence. This also has been denied by an intelligence official. Risen also alleges that the Bush Administration is responsible for the transformation of Afghanistan into a \\"narco-state\\", that provides a purported 80% of the world's heroin supply. The publication of this book was expedited following the December 16, 2005 NSA leak story. The timing of The New York Times story after the Iraq election in mid December 2005 is a source of controversy since the story was delayed for over a year. The New York Times story appeared two days before a former NSA employee, dismissed in May 2005, requested permission to testify to two Congressional intelligence oversight committees. Byron Calame, the Public Editor of The New York Times, wrote in early January 2006 that two senior Times officials refused to comment on the timing of the article. The Department of Justice (DOJ) also conducted an investigation of the sources of the security leak involving the NSA. Risen says this book is based on information from a variety of anonymous sources, that he would protect. The issue of journalists protecting their anonymous sources was widely discussed during this time period due to the Valerie Plame affair. In that case, former New York Times reporter Judith Miller was jailed for refusing to reveal a source for a story of hers. The Attorney General hinted in a Washington Post article on May 22, 2006, that journalists may be charged for any disclosure of classified national security information. President George W. Bush, in a June 25, 2006 news conference, was critical of the publication of information of classified programs by The New York Times. = United States v. Sterling = Jeffrey Alexander Sterling was investigated during the Bush administration. In 2010 he was indicted under the Espionage Act of 1917, one of the few people in US history whose alleged contact with a journalist was punished under espionage law. In 2007 Risen received a letter from the Justice Department asking him for the sources he used for the CIA-Iran chapter of his book State of War. He was then subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury in January 2008. He fought the subpoena, and it expired in the summer of 2009.Savage, Charlie (2010-04-28) U.S. Subpoenas Times Reporter Over Book on C.I.A., The New York Times In what The New York Times called \\"a rare step,\\" the Obama administration renewed the subpoena in 2010. In 2011, Risen wrote a detailed response to the subpoena, describing his reasons for refusing to reveal his sources, the public impact of his work, and his experiences with the Bush administration.Affidavit of James Risen, June 21, 2011 (with exhibits and attachments), Federation of American Scientsts, Sterling case files In July 2013 US Court of Appeals from the Fourth Circuit ruled that Risen must testify in the trial of Jeffrey Sterling. The court wrote \\"so long as the subpoena is issued in good faith and is based on a legitimate need of law enforcement, the government need not make any special showing to obtain evidence of criminal conduct from a reporter in a criminal proceeding.\\" Judge Roger Gregory dissented, writing \\"The majority exalts the interests of the government while unduly trampling those of the press, and in doing so, severely impinges on the press and the free flow of information in our society.\\"Russell Boyce, \\"Court rules journalists can't keep their sources secret\\", Reuters, July 19, 2013.

Overview Since neither Tense Nervous Headache or Boyfriend are any longer available, High Hat remains the only place to find any of Boy George's songs from 1988 to 1989. While High Hat has only ten tracks, the two other albums together included eighteen tracks: nine on the vinyl and twelve on the CD and cassette for Tense Nervous Headache; plus eight for Boyfriend, one of which (the hi-energy remix of \\"No Clause 28\\", also known as \\"Pascal Gabriel Mix\\") would later re-surface on Jesus Loves You's The Martyr Mantras album. Tense Nervous Headache was shelved in the UK shortly after release of the first single due to lack of interest (or, as George put it in his autobiography,Boy George with Spencer Bright (1995), Take It Like a Man, London, Sidgwick & Jackson after it \\"died a solitary death\\"), despite the singer getting to No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart the previous year with \\"Everything I Own\\". Half of the ten tracks on High Hat were quite unsuccessful singles either taken from Tense Nervous Headache or Boyfriend: \\"Don't Cry\\", \\"Whisper\\", \\"Don't Take My Mind on a Trip\\", \\"You Found Another Guy\\" and \\"Whether They Like It or Not\\". The only track actually taken from High Hat as an independent single in America was the US remix of the opener \\"Don't Take My Mind on a Trip\\"; the version of which included on High Hat is slightly different from that originally opening Boyfriend. \\"Don't Take My Mind on a Trip\\" was a club hit in Canada and the US, charting at No. 5 on the Billboard R&B; charts. \\"You Found Another Guy\\" went into the top 40 of the same charts also. High Hat nonetheless did a little better than its US predecessor Sold, reaching number 126 on the Billboard charts.Boy George solo discography awards It was also released in Australia (V2555) and Mexico (LEMP-1640).

Heeley City Farm is a city farm in the district of Heeley, Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England. It is a community-based and led training, employment and youth enterprise. Heeley City Farm was founded in 1981 on land where the Sheffield South Relief road —commonly called the Heeley bypass, a scheme which blighted the lives of hundreds of local residents for 30 years— was to be built. Construction never started and the land was put to new use. Heeley City Farm includes a wind and sun powered mini-farm and a number of environmental social enterprises and attractions. The focus of its work is in Heeley but increasingly it operates throughout Sheffield and into the South Yorkshire region, including work at Wortley walled garden, Dore and Meersbrook. Now over 25 years old and winner of several national and international awards, Heeley City Farm provides environmental, health, food and farming education to around 5,000 school children and several thousands adult visitors each year. The South Yorkshire Energy Centre (SYEC), which opened in August 2006, demonstrates renewable energy and sustainable building materials and techniques and provides advice and courses for building professionals, individual householders and school parties. Heeley City Farm maintains a much needed green space in inner suburban Sheffield with recycling, healthy living facilities, a garden centre, cafe, and charity shop. Day care and training for up to 20 adults with learning difficulties is provided along with vocational training in horticulture for up to 100 unemployed adults, youth activities for up to 2,000 young people (including young people not attending school) and support for over 100 regular volunteers. Heeley City Farm describes itself as a community or social enterprise; it is committed to supporting those most in need in its community using enterprising methods. It runs training programmes (including language and Basic Skills support) and creates jobs (by developing mini enterprises). Emphasis is placed on long term unemployed adults, people with learning disabilities and those suffering disadvantage or discrimination in achieving skills and employment and young people. Income comes mostly from social enterprise activity including public sector service contracts, enterprise sales and consultancy services. In 2005, less than 25% of income was described as funding but this included charitable funding and grants for specific projects or activities. The Farm recently began a program named \\"Digging our Roots\\" that teaches young people about British archaeological heritage. Part of this project has featured the reconstruction of an Iron Age Roundhouse, which began on 31 October 2008 and is due to be completed in early 2011. The University of Sheffield's Archaeological Department and student-run Archaeological Society are involved in the project and has been used as part of an Experimental Archaeological study.

Designed to confirm accusations of the lack of patriotism among German Jews, the census disproved the charges, but its results were not made public.\\"Deutsche Jüdische Soldaten” Bavarian National Exhibition However, its figures were leaked out, being published in an antisemitic brochure. The Jewish authorities, who themselves had compiled statistics which considerably exceeded the figures in the brochure, were not only denied access to the government archives but also informed by the Republican Minister of Defense that the contents of the antisemitic brochure were correct.

Background The census was seen as a way to prove that Jews were betraying the Fatherland by shirking military service. According to Amos Elon, > \\"In October 1916, when almost three thousand Jews had already died on the > battlefield and more than seven thousand had been decorated, War Minister > Wild von Hohenborn saw fit to sanction the growing prejudices.

Metropolitan Books. p.338. The > author cites the following sources for his numbers: *R. Vogel: Ein Stück von > uns: Deutsche Juden in deutschen Armeen, 1813-1976, Mainz, 1977, p.149 *Leo > Baeck Institute Yearbook 19 (1974): p.143. The official position was that the census was intended to discredit growing anti-semitic sentiments and rumors. However, the evidence indicated that the government's intention was the opposite: to acquire confirmation of the purported ill deeds.Die Zeit, http://www.zeit.de/1996/42/Dazu_haelt_man_fuer_sein_Land_den_Schaedel There was a long history of Jews in Germany being discriminated against, oppressed, and denied rank within the military and other government institutions. This fact disproves the \\"less than eager to serve\\" attitude of Jews in Germany.Amos Elon (2002) The Pity Of It All. A History of Jews in Germany 1743-1933, pp. 340. Results and reactions \\"12,000 Jewish soldiers died on the field of honor for the fatherland.\\" A leaflet published in 1920 by German Jewish veterans in response to accusations of the lack of patriotism The episode marked a shocking moment for the Jewish community, which had passionately backed the War effort and displayed great patriotism; many Jews saw it as an opportunity to prove their commitment to the German homeland. Over 100,000 had served in the Army; 12,000 perished in battle, while another 35,000 were decorated for bravery.Die Judischen Gefallenen A Roll of Honor Commemorating the 12,000 German Jews Who Died for their Fatherland in World War I.\\"About 10,000 volunteered for duty, and over 100,000 out of a total German-Jewish population of 550,000 served during World War One.

Approximately 2,000 Jews became military officers and 1,200 became medical officers\\".

Holocaust and Genocide Studies, Fall 2006; 20: 183 - 206. The episode also led increasing numbers of young German Jews to accept Zionism, as they realized that full assimilation into German society was unattainable.

Neuere und Neueste Geschichte German Jewish writer Arnold Zweig, who had volunteered for the army and seen action in the rank of private in France, Hungary and Serbia, was stationed at the Western Front when the Judenzählung census was undertaken.

If there was no antisemitism in the Army, the unbearable call > to duty would be almost easy.\\" Shaken by the experience, Zweig began to revise his views on the war and to realize that it pitted Jews against Jews. Later he described his experiences in the short story Judenzählung vor VerdunNoah William Isenberg: Between Redemption and Doom. The Strains of German-Jewish Modernism p.59-60 and became an active pacifist.

Based upon the Golden Age character Rex Tyler, he first appeared in JLA #12 (November 1997). Fictional character biography =Creation in the 853rd century= The Hourman of the 853rd century is an android (though he describes himself as an \\"intelligent machine colony\\") constructed by Tyler Chemorobotics (formerly TylerCo). Although he is an android, he possesses the full range of emotions and human flaws that an ordinary human does. Nonetheless, the technology with which he was constructed is far advanced beyond anything conceivable in the 20th century. Why the android was built is unknown, although it seems likely that he was in fact commissioned by the New God Metron, who sought to make it his replacement and apprentice. Rex Tyler (the original Hourman), who served as the biological template for the android, spent some time in the future and was involved in its construction. =JLA: Rock of Ages= Shortly after its construction, Metron appointed Hourman as his heir and entrusted him with the Worlogog. The Worlogog was an ancient artifact containing a map of space/time from Creation until the End of the Universe in miniature. The Worlogog, in form of a stone, had been lost for centuries on Earth until it was unearthed by a LexCorp requisition team and was dubbed the Philosopher's Stone. Lex Luthor, not fully understanding the stone, used it to manipulate the alien Jemm with his Injustice Gang against the Justice League of America. The Justice League (notably Batman, Martian Manhunter, and Superman) defeated Luthor and as Superman stood ready to destroy the Worlogog, a temporal split was created. Were Superman to seemingly destroy the stone, the villain Darkseid would be able to conquer and subjugate the Earth. The corrupted Metron of that future traveled back along the timeline to gather a group of Justice Leaguers that would search for the stone so that it would (unknown to them) fall into the hands of Darkseid. A timeline in which Superman did not destroy the stone, however, did remain, and to counter the corrupted Metron, Hourman himself also traveled back in time, searching out the Leaguers that were searching for the stone. He was able to convince Green Lantern Kyle Rayner of the terrible future that would follow if they found the stone, and he convinced his teammates Aquaman and The Flash (Wally West) to try to stop Darkseid. The three heroes ended up in the alternate timeline in which Darkseid had won, and with the help of their surviving teammates, were able to travel back along the timeline themselves and get a telepathic message to the Martian Manhunter, who stopped Superman from destroying the stone. The Worlogog was handed to the real Metron, who passed it onto Hourman, who thereby outgrew his role as apprentice and became the master of time and Hypertime, while retaining his membership in the Justice Legion A. =DC One Million= Hourman would later be instrumental in the organization of the celebrations for the return of Superman Prime to the 853rd century. Hourman would use the Worlogog to transport the Justice Legion A into the past to meet the original Justice League, and would then send the League into the future to participate in a form of \\"super-Olympics\\". It went according to plan, except the inclusion of the old villain Solaris, who placed a virus (dubbed the Hourman Virus) in the android's body that disabled his time-traveling abilities the moment he reached the past. Now the Legion was stranded in the past and the League in the future. The Hourman Virus spread to the Justice Legion and then to the rest of the world, which affected both humans and machines. The metahuman population became hostile to the Legion as a result, and they also had to deal with Vandal Savage. It turned out that the virus was the core programming of Solaris, and the Legion would have to create a body in the 20th century for Solaris so the virus could be downloaded into the new body. Hourman was paralyzed by self-pity. Nonetheless, the Hourman Virus was overcome and Hourman could travel back to the future, and as such, he and the Legion could witness the defeat of Solaris by the hands of Superman Prime, Superman M*, and Green Lantern. During the celebrations, Hourman reached into the past, seconds before Krypton exploded and created a duplicate of the planet in the 853rd century. He then reached back and plucked the population of Krypton from their world in the seconds after the launch of Kal-El's rocket and before Krypton's final destruction. All this created the world of New Krypton where Superman Prime could live amongst other superpowered Kryptonians, including his parents, as a gift from his comrades in the Justice League and Legions. =Joining the League= After the celebrations had finished, Hourman felt inadequate since he had been used so easily by Solaris as the carrier of the Hourman Virus. Deciding that he needed some more personal growth, he travelled back to the 20th century, since there he could truly grow, unlike in the wondrous 853rd century. Thus he arrived at the Justice League Watchtower, where he would serve as a replacement for the Martian Manhunter (who was on a temporary leave of absence). Immediately upon his entrance, he made somewhat of a temporal snafu, by asking if he had arrived before or after the invasion of the 5th dimension. He arrived at the Justice League Watchtower, having signaled ahead that he was coming. He did not truly fit in with the League, however, and used his time-vision on multiple occasions to skip over conversations he deemed unnecessary. Eventually, a few members of the League decided to call him on it and decided that Batman would be best to talk some sense into Hourman. Although annoyed by their interference, he explained to Hourman the worth of thinking before acting. Hourman took the advice rather literally and used his time-vision to learn the history of the Justice League through Batman's experiences. From those experiences, Hourman decided that the best person to guide him through his personal growth was the former mascot of the League, and normal human, Snapper Carr. =Solo Series= Hourman and the League found Snapper waiting for them in a Happy Harbor café. Thanks to Hourman's unconscious manipulations of time, Snapper had received a premonition and knew that he would need to help him out. Snapper nicknamed the android Matthew Tyler and took him under his wing, and the two hit it off perfectly. After Hourman met the android Amazo, Hourman was convinced that he was even more of a liability than before. Snapper helped Hourman understand that he was having problems fitting into the normal world because of the power he wielded. He was practically omnipotent and could manipulate time to his wishes, never learning from his mistakes, and that was what was hindering him, not his lack of experience. Just as impulsively as he had acted before, Hourman concentrated on breaking down the Worlogog, the source of his almost omnipotent power, scattering its components. He still retained the ability to use his time vision and time travel abilities for an hour out of every 24, so that he was truly an Hourman now. He also kept the permanent abilities of Miraclo strength and speed. That was not the only effect his confrontation with Amazo had on Hourman. He asked himself if Amazo was the first android, and thus the Adam of the androids; were they inherently meant to be evil? To find the answer to his dilemma, Hourman sought out Professor Ivo, the creator of the Amazo android. In his Hour of Power, he learned how Ivo and Professor T.O. Morrow had created the android Tomorrow Woman, who had broken her programming goal of killing the League and instead died as a hero. He revived her, and for the last fifty minutes of his Hour of Power, she continued that existence, cementing her status as a hero as she saved lives and lived her life to the fullest. She taught Hourman what consequences his actions can have. In that short time, the two formed a connection that ultimately, when Tomorrow Woman disappeared at the end of the hour, left Hourman with a hole in his non-existent heart. =Joining the Society= While fighting alongside the Justice League in the war with the 5th Dimension, Hourman met the Justice Society of America, and thanks to the feelings and memories of the original Hourman that he possessed, he felt a kinship to them. When asked by Jay Garrick, he attended the funeral of Wesley Dodds, the original Sandman. Together with the others present, he was dragged into the battle for the future Doctor Fate. At the end of that adventure, he joined the Justice Society. During this time, he is often simply referred to as \\"Tyler\\". When Hourman met Rick Tyler, son and heir of the original Hourman, they fought. They would eventually make amends when Amazo, disguised as a future version of Hourman, cures Rick of the disease he had contracted thanks to his Miraclo addiction. After spending some more time with the Society, Hourman left to explore the timestream more, but not before giving Rick two gifts, the first of which was a tachyon-filled hourglass that would give Rick the occasional 'vision' of the future that would take place in an hour's time. The second of these was another hour with Rick's father, Rex Tyler, whom Hourman retrieved from the fight with Extant and relocated to the Timepoint, a recreation of Rex's old lab; using a special gauntlet, Rick could travel to and from the Timepoint to talk with his father, with time not existing for Rex while Rick was absent, but once an hour had elapsed Rex would have to leave to fight Extant and meet his pre-ordained death. He recently returned at the behest of the Society when Rick was stranded in the Timepoint, mortally wounded. Rick was saved, although Rex's hour in the Timepoint was up and now either Rick or Rex was going to die facing Extant. Instead, Matthew gave his life and took their place, impersonating Rex with a hologram, leaving them with the hourglass from his chest to allow them to return home. When Rex told Hourman that he was as alive as any of them despite being an android, Hourman replied that he appreciated that more than Rex could ever know, and asked Rex to give his wife his love before he returned to the battle with Extant. His broken pieces were retrieved by Rex, who attempts to rebuild him. A short time later, Rip Hunter said during a team-up with the JSA that the android Hourman would be gone \\"for a relative year\\", indicating he may return. Powers and abilities Hourman is often simply called an android, but is actually an intelligent machine colony (possibly a form of nanotechnology) created by Tylerco in the far future. If damaged, this colony can effortlessly multiply and repair. His software is encoded with the genetics of Rex Tyler, giving him all of Rex's memories. He originally possessed the Worlogog, which gave him complete control over time. He later gave all but a shard of it up, but not before he absorbed all of Batman's memories of the JLA. Though not as powerful as he was originally, Tyler still retained super strength, durability, and speed equivalent to a person using Miraclo. He was able to access an \\"Hour of Power\\", sixty minutes during which he had power over time. He can do many things with this control: move between picoseconds, travel through time, use his own time vision (which allows him to see a person's past and future as well as age) or make people and things younger, slow a person down until essentially frozen, create tunnels between different time periods, and share power with other individuals (though the amount of time that he provides them power for directly takes away from his sixty minutes). Tyler activates the Hour of Power at will and the hourglass on his chest keeps count of the time. There seems to be some doubt how often he can use his Hour of Power. Like the other Hourmans' use of Miraclo, sometimes Tyler is said to only have one Hour of Power a day, while at other times he simply must wait another hour to recharge before he can reactivate, and it is unclear if he must use the entire Hour in one moment or if he can spread it out over the course of the day. Tyler also has a timeship that he can summon from the timestream. It is connected to him and reacts to his thoughts. It normally appears as a Viking- style wooden sailing ship adorned with clocks, but it can change form as Tyler dictates to anything from a simple wooden skiff to a futuristic spaceship and also be used as a weapon, as when Hourman made a large hand out of it to trap Extant. The ship can travel through time, to alternate timelines, or through Hypertime.

The village, which is now effectively a commuter suburb, lies between Holywood and Bangor to the north of the A2 road, about 4 km west of Bangor town centre. Bounded to the north and north east by Crawfordsburn Country Park, the village attracts many visitors. It had a population of 587 people in the 2011 Census. History Before the Plantation of Ulster, the area of Crawfordsburn was known as Ballymullan (). Crawfordsburn originated in the 17th century as a small settlement on an important routeway along North Down. It was named after a stream which flows through the village. It has retained elements of its 17th-century history along its Main Street including the coaching inn. The Sharman-Crawford family developed the village in the 18th and 19th centuries. Crawfordsburn was promoted as a Victorian tourist attraction, particularly for those visitors using the railway to nearby Helens Bay.

The band was formed in September 1990 under the name \\"Rest in Peace\\". A year after their formation the band started appearing live locally. In 1992, they changed their name to Raining Pleasure and started touring Greece. In 1994, the band self-recorded and released a demo of their work (limited to 160 copies); since then, most of its songs have been rerecorded and included in their studio albums. For two more years, the band continued touring Greece and, in 1996, had three of its songs released through Pop & Rock 's magazine compilation Dytiki Akti '96. Career Near the end of 1996, the band signed a contract with Lazy Dog Records based in Thessaloniki; in early 1997, they released their first full-length studio album Memory Comes Back which was well-received from the independent press at the time. Their second release, Nostalgia, appeared in August 1998 also under the Lazy Dog banner. Raining Pleasure had the chance that two of their songs be included in two compilations produced by the European collaboration of great radio stations. Also in 1998, one of the issues of the Greek fanzine Fractal Press included a 7 inch vinyl single including the songs \\"Winters of Waiting\\" and \\"Love\\" (both recorded during the Memories Come Back sessions but left out of the record). =Deal with Chrysalis= In fall 2000, Raining Pleasure signed a contract with Chrysalis Records, originally obtaining the label as an imprint for their Minos EMI releases. This made them one of the relatively few English-speaking band in Greece to sign with a multinational record company (the short list includes Closer, Ziggy Was, and, predating them both, The Last Drive). However, no albums were released by Chrysalis Records while under contract and subsequent releases were only available in foreign markets as imports. Around April 2001, the band recorded and released the EP Capricorn before returning to the studio to record their third full-length studio album, their first for a major label. =Flood release= In December 2001, Raining Pleasure's major label debut Flood was released to critical acclaim. The album performed exceptionally well on the charts, spending 15 weeks on the international chart where it peaked at No. 1 before chart regulations necessitated the album's move to the local repertoire chart where it peaked at No. 5 (an unprecedented feat for a Greek act performing in English). The album spent well over a year on the Top 40 Artist Album Charts and has been certified Gold. It spawned three airplay hits in Greece, the biggest of which, \\"Fake,\\" has become a pop and rock radio staple, and has been used in several commercial spots as well as in the soundtrack of the film \\"The Best of Times\\" directed by the Taiwanese director Tso-chi Chang. \\"Fake\\" was followed by the hits \\"Capricorn\\" and \\"Only Through You\\". Raining Pleasure gave a series of successful concerts in Greece, which resulted them in supporting bands like The Cure, the Pixies, The Dandy Warhols and Black Rebel Motorcycle Club in their Greek shows. In 2004, the group's album Forwards & Backwards was introduced by the double A-side single World / Identical Twins. Singer Elly Paspala contributed vocals to the track Identical Twins. Both songs in the single became airplay hits. In March, the band's cover of ABBA's \\"Dancing Queen\\" was featured in the Greek film Hardcore and remained in the airplay charts over six months. In winter of 2004, the band embarked on its first mini-tour in Germany while in a studio in Cologne to record a new version of the classic album Reflections (originally by Manos Hadjidakis and the New York Rock & Roll Ensemble). Raining Pleasure's Reflections was released to immediate critical acclaim. The album was introduced to media at a concert at St Paul's Anglican Church in Athens. The album has been certified gold. =Celesta Records= In 2007, they formed their own independent record label Celesta Records under which they released their newest album Who's Gonna Tell Juliet?

The village is made up of private lodges, a restaurant and bar, commercial accommodation, and facilities for snow sports and other outdoor recreation. Guthega is also the site for the Guthega Power Station - a dam used to generate hydro electricity as part of the Snowy Mountains Scheme, now managed by Snowy Hydro. History The Aboriginal cultural group Ngarigo were nomadic between Canberra, the Monaro plains, and into the Snowy Mountains for over 20,000 years. Pressures from European Settlers caused an increase in intertribal wars possibly taking place in the mountain areas around the Snowy River and similar water ways. Diseases introduced by the settlers such as Small Pox, Syphilis, Influenza, Measles and Tuberculosis devastated Aboriginal populations, and by 1850 the survivors had all moved off their traditional lands, giving up their lifestyles to live with the Europeans around Cooma. Herbert Schlink, Eric Fischer, William Gordon and John Laidley, of the Ski Club of Australia, with W Hughes, made the first winter crossing of the Main Range from Kiandra to Kosciusko in 1927. Guthega was declared a dam and hydro election power station site by the Snowy Mountains Scheme in 1949. Road works for the Guthega Power Station began in 1951http://nla.gov.au/nla.news- article2829318A with the dam beginning in 1952. A Norwegian group was contracted to build the power station, and Guthega became known as \\"Little Norway\\", containing the largest number of Norwegians living outside Norway at the time. Power was first generated by the station 1955. Recreational skiing began at Guthega in the late 1950s with the first rope tow for downhill skiing being installed on Mount Tate's East Ridge by the SMA Ski Club in 1957. The YMCA Ski Club (now the Brindabella Ski Club) built two huts and one rope tow in 1960, and started running ski lessons with lodging. The SMA Tow hut burned down in 1965 and it was not replaced, but the first T-bar tow was erected on the West slopes of Mount Blue Calf that same year. In 1966 Walter Spanring and his wife Hannelore (Eberstaller), key developers of Guthega's ski areas to date, built the Guthega Hotel (later becoming the Guthega Alpine Hotel). In 1974 Peter Aynsley designed the Australian Ski Club lodge next to the Guthega Hotel and with financial assistance from the smaller ski clubs in the area, expansion of the skiing facilities on the West Face of Mount Blue Calf began in 1975. In 1980 new investors were brought in, and further development saw car parks, a chairlift, a ski centre and general upgrades completed by 1983. Guthega's new ski facilities were launched in 1983 with an international marketing campaign that included: Mount Tate. * Range Rover Australian Freestyle Championships * Peter Stuyvesant International Pro-Am Dual Slalom * Australian Playboy's $10,000 \\"Girls of the Snow\\" Quest * Cold Chisel in concert at The Lake Jindabyne Hotel for the Playboy grand final * Ovaltine ski racing for amateurs and recreational skiers In 1991, Guthega was purchased by the Alpine Australia Group Pty Limited, the then operator of the Blue Cow Resort. This led to the operation of two resorts becoming integrated under the name Blue Cow-Guthega in 1992. Day access into Guthega then became possible via the Skitube alpine railway and the Blue Cow and Link Management Unit ski slopes. The Blue Cow-Guthega and Perisher-Smiggins resort areas were subsequently merged to become the Perisher Blue complex. Guthega skiing is included in the trail maps of the Perisher Blue ski resort, and a chair lift and two T-bars are sometimes operated from Guthega to link with Perisher Blue depending on demand. As well as downhill skiing, Guthega serves as a base for alpine and cross country skiers and boarders seeking access to relatively sheltered aspects and wilderness experiences, as well ice climbers heading to Blue Lake. In summer months it is used as a destination for sight seers and people enjoying recreation in the surrounding Kosciuszko National Park.

The Moorland–Spingarn Research Center (MSRC) is recognized as one of the world's largest and most comprehensive repositories for the documentation of the history and culture of people of African descent in Africa, the Americas, and other parts of the world. As one of Howard University's major research facilities, the MSRC collects, preserves, organizes and makes available for research a wide range of resources chronicling the Black experience. Thus, it maintains a tradition of service which dates to the formative years of Howard University, when materials related to Africa and African Americans were first acquired.  History  In 1914, Dr. J. E. Moorland, a Black theologian who was an alumnus and trustee of the University, donated his private library, at that time considered to be one of the most significant collections of Black related materials in existence. Dr. Moorland's donation reflected the efforts of African Americans to take a leadership role in the documentation, preservation, and study of their own history and culture. His collection provided the catalyst for the centralization of the University Library's other Black-related materials, which became known collectively as The Moorland Foundation. In 1946 Howard University acquired the large personal library of Arthur B. Spingarn, an attorney, social activist, and prominent collector of books and other materials produced by Black people. The Moorland–Spingarn Research Center is named for these two benefactors whose collections provided the foundation upon which later development could be built. Although several librarians helped to develop the Moorland Foundation's collection during the early years, the appointment in 1930 of Dorothy B. Porter (later Dorothy B. Porter Wesley) signaled a new era. In a career that spanned more than forty years, Dr. Porter Wesley guided the collection through substantial expansion, including the development of a new classification scheme, authoritative bibliographies, and a wide variety of research tools. In 1973, the collections were reorganized as the Moorland- Spingarn Research Center, and Dr. Michael R. Winston was appointed its first director. Under Dr. Winston's leadership, separate Library and Manuscript Divisions were established, and the Howard University Museum and Howard University Archives were created. While the Library Division was expected to continue to expand the MSRC's extensive collections of books, newspapers, journals, and printed materials, the other units were an integral part of the Research Center's new program development. The new programs emphasized the identification, acquisition, preservation, research and exhibition of materials which could transform the existing special collections into a modern archives and manuscript repository and museum facility. From 1986 to 2010 the MSRC was directed by Thomas C. Battle. Following Dr. Battle's departure, the center was directed by Howard Dodson until 2016. The current director is Professor Rhea Ballard-Thrower. Current plans call for a greater reliance upon digitization and online accessibility, increased public programs, and sponsored research projects, including an active commitment to publishing the products of research conducted at the Research Center by its staff and other scholars.  Divisions  = The Library Division = With more than 175,000 books, pamphlets, periodicals and microforms in numerous languages in its collections, the Library Division provides extensive documentary evidence of the history, lives and struggles of people of African descent. Among the library's holdings are many rare works, going back to the sixteenth century, by such notables as Juan Latino, Jacobus Capitein, Gustavus Vassa, Phillis Wheatley, Jupiter Hammon, David Walker, Frederick Douglass and Martin Delaney. The collections are particularly strong in the first editions and first works by early twentieth century contemporary writers, including W.E.B. Du Bois, Richard Wright, Alice Walker, Nicolas Guillén, Wole Soyinka, James Baldwin, Chinua Achebe, Toni Morrison and Amiri Baraka. Special resources within the division's collections include: theses and dissertations written on Black-related topics by students of other colleges and universities; English and foreign language newspapers, journals and magazines which provide current and retrospective examination of the Black diasporic experience; and an extensive vertical file collection consisting of thousands of folders of biographical and subject-related ephemeral materials which often serve as the sole source of information on obscure as well as better known people and events. Current and rare titles are added regularly to the collection to enhance its growth and development. = Manuscript Division = The resources of the Manuscript Division combine to provide important insight into the growth and development of Black families, organizations, institutions, social and religious consciousness, and the continuing struggle for civil rights and human justice. Organized in 1974 into four departments – Manuscripts, Prints and Photographs, Oral History, and Music – the collections of primary source materials of the Manuscript Division complement the resources of the Library Division and broaden the scope of areas for research on the black experience. With holdings totaling more than 18,000 linear feet, the Manuscript department provides extensive documentation of African American life and history. Currently more than 650 collections are available for research. These collections include the correspondence, photographs, diaries, scrapbooks, writings and memorabilia of such notables as Alain Locke, E. Franklin Frazier, Frederick Douglass, Mary Church Terrell, Anna J. Cooper, and Paul and Eslanda Robeson. The Prints and Photographs Department makes available for study, research and exhibition over 150,000 graphic images, including photographs, slides, postcards, broadsides, prints, and maps. These works date from the 1800s to the present and feature drawings and sketches, daguerreotypes, tintypes, stereograph cards and glass plate negatives. Music, reflecting Black participation in and contributions to the development of jazz, folk, spiritual, popular and classical styles, is well documented by the Music Department. Its collections are rich in sheet music, recordings, song book albums, and instructional concert material for voice and piano. The collection documents over 400 composers dating from the 18th century to the present. Important and essential documentation of the civil rights era is available in the collections of the Oral History Department. The Ralph J. Bunche Oral History Collection totals well over 700 transcripts that provide valuable insight into the thoughts and actions of the people who participated in and shaped this critical period in American history. Other collections focus on women, Howard University, African American military history and memoirs of some of the donors whose papers are deposited in the Manuscript Department. = The Howard University Archives and Museum = The Howard University Archives serves as a secure repository for the official records of the University, including the administrative files of schools, colleges and departments, university publications, Howard theses and dissertations, as well as materials illustrating the contributions of Howard alumni to society. The Archives provides information on the history of Howard University and its important personages and utilizes the Howard University Museum to showcase University artifacts and memorabilia. The Museum emphasizes the visual documentation of Black history and culture. It exhibits the myriad resources of the Research Center's many special collections and acquires artifacts useful for a broad interpretation of the Black experience. = Digital Production Center = In 2013, the MSRC began a new chapter when it established an official digitization program. Through the Digital Production Center, MSRC preserves and shares its historic records with the world. The digital program also manages the Digital Howard online repository. The platform currently hosts the digital collections from the MSRC. Digital Collections include the archives of Anna J. Cooper and Howard University namesake Oliver Otis Howard as well as the Thomas Montgomery Gregory Military Collection and the 6,000 image Negatives Collection.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on June 1, 2003. In the episode, the Planet Express crew is sent to collect space honey, and find themselves in a harrowing battle with giant bees. The episode's plot originated from the writers wanting to do a story where it seemed as though a major character had died. The episode was then produced faster than normal and was well received by critics. Plot Professor Farnsworth warns the crew their next mission, to collect honey from giant space bees, was the mission which killed his previous crew. Though Bender and Fry grab at the opportunity to opt out of the mission, Leela takes offense and drags them along. At the hive, Leela paints Bender like a bee to deceive the real bees while she and Fry collect the honey. The crew discover the remains of the previous Planet Express crew and ship, but Leela insists that they press on. After gathering the honey, Leela decides to bring home a baby queen bee. On the way out, Bender inadvertently insults the hive's queen, causing the bees to attack. The crew escape, but in the ship, the baby queen awakens and attacks Leela. Fry throws himself in front of Leela to protect her, and is impaled by the bee's stinger while Leela is only pricked by the tip. Bender disposes of the bee and Leela awakens with a minor wound, but sees Fry lying dead on the floor. At Fry's funeral, Leela blames herself for his death. After taking some space honey to calm herself down and help her sleep, Leela experiences a series of dreams in which Fry is alive, all of them ending with Fry telling her to \\"wake up\\" and leaving her a souvenir from the dream in the waking world. Leela's insistence that Fry is alive leads the others to conclude that she is going insane. After awakening from a dream in which she attempts to exhume Fry's corpse, Leela concludes that she is indeed insane. Wracked with guilt and loneliness, Leela resolves to consume enough space honey to fall asleep forever and be with Fry in her dreams, but a portrait of Fry implores her not to do it. Leela tries to fight back, but a small space bee starts flying around the room. Leela throws the jar of space honey at it, causing it to turn into an entire swarm of smaller bees. As Leela clutches her picture of Fry, Fry begs Leela to wake up. Leela then awakens in a hospital to see a disheveled, crying Fry at her bedside begging her to wake up. Fry explains that she has been in a coma since the queen bee's attack; the bee's stinger pierced cleanly through him, leaving Leela to absorb all the venom. After getting a new spleen at the hospital, he stayed by Leela's side for two weeks, talking to her and waiting for her to wake up. As the two embrace, they each whisper that the other could use a shower. Production The plot originated from the writers wanting to make an episode where it seems as though a major character has really been killed off; the story came together in a matter of hours after that. At one point in the episode, Leela is crying and takes a tissue to dry her eye. However, when she does this, she tears the tissue in half. While on the surface this is a joke on Leela being a cyclops, the audio commentary reveals that this was also an in-joke among the writers. Around the time of production, David X. Cohen became sick, but still came to work anyway. To save tissues, he ripped a tissue in half. Broadcast and reception In its initial airing, the episode received a Nielsen rating of 2.4/5, placing it 81st among primetime shows for the week of May 26 – June 1, 2003. This episode was nominated for an Emmy in 2003 for Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming Less Than One Hour). Writer Patric Verrone was also nominated for an Annie Award for \\"Writing in an Animated Television Production\\" and the Writers Guild of America Award for Outstanding Writing in Animation at the 56th Writers Guild of America Awards. In 2006, this episode was named by IGN as number 24 in their list of the 25 best episodes of Futurama; the episode was included in the list because of its advancement of the relationship between Fry and Leela. IGN's 2019 reassessment of the list kept the episode at number 24 (despite the debut of an additional 68 Futurama episodes in the interim), but disregarded the Fry and Leela relationship, focusing instead on the episode's balance of dark themes and surreal imagery with a unique sense of humor. The Futon Critic rated it number 48 in its list of the top 50 television episodes of 2003. This episode is one of four featured in the Monster Robot Maniac Fun Collection, indicating it is one of Matt Groening's four favorite episodes. In 2013, it was ranked number 8 \\"as voted on by fans\\" for Comedy Central's Futurama Fanarama marathon.

It first aired on the NBC network in the United States on October 2, 1997.https://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/friends/episode-2-season-4/the-one-with- the-cat/100168 Plot Tired of having to turn sideways every time he entered or left his bedroom, Chandler suggests he and Joey sell the entertainment center. Joey objects at first, because he built it himself—and the chick and duck are living in it. Monica ran into someone from high school at the bank—Rachel's senior prom date, Chip Matthews. They get to talking, and Chip fulfills an old high school fantasy of Monica's, simply by asking her out. Rachel comes home from work to see that Chip called and assumes he wanted to talk to her. Ross, wanting to have some fun at his ex-girlfriend's expense, doesn't tell her any differently—until they're on the phone, and Rachel realizes he had called to talk to Monica. Joey places an ad for the entertainment center. Chandler is pleased, until he learns Joey is charging US$5,000 for it. He offers to change the ad to $50 or best offer, and it's revealed that Joey and everyone else do not know what Chandler's job is. Meanwhile, a cat crawls into Phoebe's guitar case. She tries to shoo it away... until she looks at the cat and becomes convinced that the spirit of her adoptive mother Lily resides in the cat. Rachel is upset that Monica would consider dating Chip, because at their prom Chip disappeared for two hours to have sex with another girl. Monica points out that she wasn't as popular as Rachel in high school, and the \\"fat girl\\" inside of her would love to have a chance to date a popular guy (even if it's ten years late). Rachel relents, and agrees to let her go. Two guys come to look at the entertainment center—but aren't willing to pay the $50. They want to trade it for a handmade canoe. Joey and Chandler won't take the canoe, so the deal is off. Ross, sick of Phoebe thinking the cat is her mom, tells the rest of the group what he thinks. Just to annoy him, Rachel says she believes Phoebe and that Jurassic Park could happen. Rachel later finds a flier for a missing cat named Julio—who looks exactly like the cat Phoebe thinks is her reincarnated mother. Ross makes the rest of the gang promise to tell Phoebe. But the gang finds she's so happy with her cat, so none of them can bring themselves to do it. Joey, trying to sell the entertainment center, offers the fact that a grown man can fit inside as a selling point. The buyer doesn't believe him, so Joey crawls inside. The prospective buyer then locks Joey in the unit and steals the rest of their furniture, including their beloved foosball table and recliners. Chandler is upset—when asked what happened, he explains: \\"Joey was born; then 28 years later I was robbed!\\" Monica finally goes on her big date with Chip and is disappointed to learn he hasn't changed at all since high school. He still hangs out with all his old buddies, works at the same movie theater, and lives with his parents. So—much to Rachel's delight—not only did Monica get to go out with Chip Matthews, she got to dump him. Ross, upset that nobody has told Phoebe the truth about the cat, finally tells her. Phoebe is upset that Ross won't at least respect her belief that Julio is her mother and support her as a friend, and Rachel suggests that to fix their friendship he apologize to Mrs. Buffay's spirit, which he does. Phoebe agrees to return the cat. Chandler, upset that Joey allowed them to get robbed, calls the guys with the canoe back and they finally make their trade.

On November 21, 2005, conservationists at the center made world history when it successfully bred in captivity a Philippine eagle- owl. Notably NFEFI had first secured the first-ever captive breeding loan between DENR-accredited institutions in the Philippines, consisting of three pairs of eagle-owls from the Avilon Montalban Zoological Park in Montalban, Rizal and transported them to Bacolod in December 2002. Two pairs showed attraction, and the couple Hinahon and Suplada—local terms for \\"calm\\" and \\"snob\\"—made courtship. It was on November 21, 2005, that an owlet was discovered in the nest, about three days old, and named Bubo. As Bubo grew, Suplada taught it how to tear pieces of mouse meat, thus rearing it.

It is at the mouth of the River Foyle. In the 2011 Census it had a population of 3,465 people. It is situated within Derry and Strabane district.  History  =Nine Years' War= Sir Henry Docwra, 1st Baron Docwra of Culmore, was an English soldier who landed with a force of 4000 foot and 200 horse troops at Culmore on 16 May 1600, as part of an attempt to quell a war against the crown in Ulster. On 22 May he marched into Derry without resistance and occupied and fortified the town. From here he harassed some local Irish in such as a way as to make them sue for peace with him. Facing stronger local Irish opposition, Docwra's troops became almost prisoners, unable to make any progress while slowly starving until some powerful Irish became allies. For his service Docwra was granted 2000 acres (8 km²) in the Precinct of Liffer. He served as Governor of Loughfoyle, and on 15 May 1621, by a patent dated at Westminster, was created Baron Docwra of Culmore. He was also Treasurer at War and a member of the Privy Council. Sir Henry died on 18 April 1631. =O'Doherty's Rebellion= Culmore Fort was an important strategic position linked to the garrison town of Derry. In 1608 when Sir Cahir O'Doherty, a formerly loyal Gaelic leader, launched O'Doherty's Rebellion by seizing and burning Derry he began by first capturing a supply of arms from the arsenal at Culmore after capturing its commander Captain Henry Hart. =Recent history= Amelia Earhart landed in a pasture at Culmore after her 1932 transatlantic solo flight. A small museum, the Amelia Earhart Centre, has been built there, but the museum is presently closed due to vandalism.

The Deutsche Morgenländische Gesellschaft (, German Oriental Society), abbreviated DMG, is a scholarly organization dedicated to Oriental studies, that is, to the study of the languages and cultures of the Near East and the Far East, the broader Orient, Asia, Oceania, and Africa. The DMG was established on 2 October 1845 in Leipzig by leading Oriental scholars from Germany, as well as members of other Orientalist societies such as the Asiatic Societies in Paris (the Société Asiatique), London (the Royal Asiatic Society), and Calcutta (the Asiatic Society). It was founded \\"to promote all aspects of the knowledge of Asia and of the countries closely related to it in every aspect, and to propagate participation of this in wider circles. Hence the Society will deal not only with oriental literature (morgenländische Literatur) but also with the history of these countries and the research of their situation both earlier and more recent times.\\" The DMG has traditionally concentrated on the \\"knowledge of languages, literatures, history, religions and philosophies, forms of law and society, archaeology, and the art and material culture of the people living in these areas\\". In recent years, its scope has expanded to include sociology and political science as well. The academic disciplines represented in the DMG include the following: Ancient Near Eastern studies, Semitic languages, Jewish studies, Arabic studies, Islamic studies, the study of Oriental Christianity, Persian studies and Iranian studies, Indology, Turkish studies, Central Asian studies, Indo- European studies, Mongolian studies, Tibetan studies, Sinology, Japanese studies, Southeast Asian studies, and African studies. The publishing program of the DMG consists of its internationally renowned journal, the Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft (ZDMG), published since 1847, and its monograph series, Abhandlungen für die Kunde des Morgenlandes (AKM), published since 1857, as well as the Beiruter Texte und Studien (BTS), which have been published since 1964.

It was released as Stolen Goods in the UK, and this version was later released in a colorized version on home video. Plot George 'Gabby' Hayes, John Wayne, and Eleanor Hunt in the film Wayne plays John Carruthers, an undercover US Marshal, but that is not disclosed until well into the film. He appears to be in town investigating a string of robberies committed by the Polka Dot Bandit (Yakima Canutt), but when he is a little late in discovering one of the Bandit's latest thefts, Sheriff Jake (George \\"Gabby\\" Hayes) thinks he is the thief. For some reason, instead of arresting him, Jake accompanies him on his journey; after all, as Wayne says, \\"It's kind of lonesome trailing alone.\\" The two stumble upon a gang robbing a pack-mule train; they rescue Betty Mason (Eleanor Hunt), whose father has just been killed by the bandits. She and her father were bringing desperately needed provisions to town, but the bandits have successfully cut off any supplies, forcing the townspeople to consider fleeing their homes or starving to death. It turns out that the local rich man, with the meaningful name of Malgrove (Edward Peil Sr.), is behind the robberies. He knows there's a vein of gold underneath the homesteaders' property, and he offers out of the kindness of his heart to purchase their land for a pittance. B-movie bad guys have a tendency to crow about their evil plans without checking to see if anyone is hiding nearby, and when the grieving Betty overhears his plans, Malgrove and his henchmen kidnap her. Carruthers and Jake offer to make one last attempt to bring supplies in, and Malgrove and his henchmen make plans to murder them.

Let the consistent set of members' deformations be given by \\\\mathbf{q}_{M \\\\times 1} , which can be computed using the member flexibility relation. These member deformations give rise to the nodal displacements \\\\mathbf{r}_{N \\\\times 1} , which we want to determine. We start by applying N virtual nodal forces \\\\mathbf{R}^*_{N \\\\times 1} , one for each wanted r, and find the virtual member forces \\\\mathbf{Q}^*_{M \\\\times 1} that are in equilibrium with \\\\mathbf{R}^*_{N \\\\times 1} : :\\\\mathbf{Q}^*_{M \\\\times 1} = \\\\mathbf{B}_{M \\\\times N} \\\\mathbf{R}^*_{N \\\\times 1} \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\mathrm{(1)} In the case of a statically indeterminate system, matrix B is not unique because the set of \\\\mathbf{Q}^*_{M \\\\times 1} that satisfies nodal equilibrium is infinite. It can be computed as the inverse of the nodal equilibrium matrix of any primary system derived from the original system. Imagine that internal and external virtual forces undergo, respectively, the real deformations and displacements; the virtual work done can be expressed as: * External virtual work: \\\\mathbf{R}^{*T} \\\\mathbf{r} * Internal virtual work: \\\\mathbf{Q}^{*T} \\\\mathbf{q} According to the virtual work principle, the two work expressions are equal: :\\\\mathbf{R}^{*T} \\\\mathbf{r} = \\\\mathbf{Q}^{*T} \\\\mathbf{q} Substitution of (1) gives :\\\\mathbf{R}^{*T} \\\\mathbf{r} = \\\\mathbf{R}^{*T} \\\\mathbf{B}^{T} \\\\mathbf{q} Since \\\\mathbf{R}^{*} contains arbitrary virtual forces, the above equation gives : \\\\mathbf{r} = \\\\mathbf{B}^{T} \\\\mathbf{q} \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\mathrm{(2)} It is remarkable that the computation in (2) does not involve any integration regardless of the complexity of the systems, and that the result is unique irrespective of the choice of primary system for B. It is thus far more convenient and general than the classical form of the dummy unit load method, which varies with the type of system as well as with the imposed external effects. On the other hand, it is important to note that Eq.(2) is for computing displacements or rotations of the nodes only. This is not a restriction because we can make any point into a node when desired. Finally, the name unit load arises from the interpretation that the coefficients B_{i,j} in matrix B are the member forces in equilibrium with the unit nodal force R^*_j = 1 , by virtue of Eq.(1). General systems For a general system, the unit dummy force method also comes directly from the virtual work principle. Fig.(a) shows a system with known actual deformations \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\epsilon} . These deformations, supposedly consistent, give rise to displacements throughout the system. For example, a point A has moved to A', and we want to compute the displacement r of A in the direction shown. For this particular purpose, we choose the virtual force system in Fig.(b) which shows: * The unit force R* is at A and in the direction of r so that the external virtual work done by R* is, noting that the work done by the virtual reactions in (b) is zero because their displacements in (a) are zero: : R^* \\\\times r = 1 \\\\times r : The desired displacement * The internal virtual work done by the virtual stresses is : \\\\int_{V}\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\epsilon}^T \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}^* dV :where the virtual stresses \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}^* must satisfy equilibrium everywhere. Equating the two work expressions gives the desired displacement: : 1 \\\\times r = \\\\int_{V}\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\epsilon}^T \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}^* dV Category:Structural analysis ","title":"Unit dummy force method"},{"id":"3606946","text":"thumb Jacob de Haan (born March 28, 1959 in Heerenveen) is a Dutch contemporary composer known for wind music.

Tchelistcheff is most notable for his contributions toward defining the style of California's best wines, especially Cabernet Sauvignon. Called the \\"dean of American winemakers\\", industry pioneers, such as Rev. John Staten of Field Stone Winery, Robert Mondavi, Louis Martini and Rob Davis of Jordan Vineyard & Winery, and Rick Sayre of Rodney Strong Wine Estates, considered him their mentor.Счастье из бокала History =Childhood and education= Born to an aristocratic family in Moscow, Russia in 1901, Tchelistcheff's father was Chief Justice of the Russian Imperial Court. Tchelistcheff studied at the military academy at Kiev, but returned to his family when they were forced to flee Moscow due to the Russian Revolution of 1917. From 1918-1921, Tchelistcheff fought with the White Army in the Russian Civil War. In 1921, he was left for dead on a Crimean battlefield after his unit was machine-gunned during a snowstorm. He eventually recovered and was reunited with his family, who fled Russia to Yugoslavia. After leaving Russia, Tchelistcheff studied agricultural technology in Czechoslovakia and then continued his education in France at both the Institut Pasteur and the Institut National Agronomique, where he studied oenology, fermentation and microbiology. =Winemaker= In 1938, Beaulieu Vineyards (BV) founder and owner Georges de Latour visited France in search of a new winemaker who had a cosmopolitan and scientific background. He was introduced to Tchelistcheff at the French National Agronomy Institute where Andre was working, along with research he was doing at the Pasteur Institute. This introduction came through the auspices of Leon Bonnet, Emeritus Professor at University of California, Berkeley and a BV consultant. Although Tchelistcheff had already received offers from winemakers worldwide, he agreed to join Beaulieu Vineyard, and arrived in Napa Valley, California in September, 1938 as BV's vice president and chief winemaker. Tchelistcheff's impact at BV was immediate and profound: he concentrated his efforts on defining a style for high-quality California Cabernet Sauvignon, and created the \\"Georges de Latour Private Reserve\\" label. He introduced new techniques and procedures to the region, such as aging wine in small French Oak barrels. By the mid-1940s, \\"Private Reserve\\" was widely recognized as the benchmark for California Cabernet Sauvignon, and was served at all important White House functions. The shift to using small American oak barrels took place after the US entered WWII, and became an accepted tradition at BV under Tchelistcheff and his successors until 1989. Tchelistcheff provided significant contributions to the techniques of cold fermentation, vineyard frost protection, malolactic fermentation, and the development of winemaking regions in Carneros, California, Oregon and Washington. He remained vice president of Beaulieu Vineyards until his retirement in 1973. He later became consulting enologist at Jordan Vineyard & Winery beginning with its inaugural 1976 vintage. He also operated a private wine laboratory in St. Helena and consulted to Joseph Heitz, Rev. John Staten of Field Stone Winery, Mike Grgich, Joel Aiken, Jordan, Neibaum/Coppola, Buena Vista Winery, George & Peter Rubissow, Erath Winery, Sequoia Grove, Chateau Ste. Michelle, and Columbia Crest Winery. While consulting for Chateau Ste. Michelle in Washington, Tchelistcheff also gave winemaking advice to his nephew, Alex Golitzin. After four years as an amateur winemaker, and encouraged by his uncle, Golitzin founded Quilceda Creek Vintners in Snohomish, Washington, a winery that would eventually achieve six 100-point scores for its Columbia Valley AVA Cabernet Sauvignon from wine critic Robert Parker. A man of diminutive stature (4'11\\"), his quick wit, sharp intellect, and legendarily refined palate endeared him to three generations of California winemakers, who affectionately referred to him as the \\"Maestro.\\" Tchelistcheff was inducted into the Culinary Institute of America's Vintner's Hall of Fame in 2007. \\"Vintners Hall of Fame Inductees,\\" Culinary Institute of America A grand- nephew of André, Mark Tchelistcheff, is completing a feature-length film about André: André Tchelistcheff: The voice of wine. \\"André Tchelistcheff: The voice of wine.\\" Feature documentary Awards *Wine Spectator Distinguished Service Award, 1986. *Wine Man of the Year, Wine Industry Technical Symposium, 1990 *Reader's Choice Award, The Person Who Has Done the Most to Advance Wine Quality, Wine Spectator 2000 *COPIA Lifetime Achievement Award, 2004. *Vintners Hall of Fame (Created by the Culinary Institute of America), March 2007 See also *List of wine personalities References External links *Obituary.

It is home to the Liszt Collection, which features several valuable books and manuscripts donated by Franz Liszt upon his death, and the AVISO studio, a collaboration between the governments of Hungary and Japan to provide sound recording equipment and training for students. The Liszt Ferenc Academy of Music was founded by Franz Liszt himself (though named after its founder only in 1925, approx. 50 years after it was relocated to its current location at the heart of Budapest). Facilities The Academy was originally called the \\"Royal National Hungarian Academy of Music\\" and it was also called \\"College of Music\\" from 1919 to 1925. It was then named after its founder Franz Liszt in 1925. It was founded in Liszt's home, and relocated to a three-story Neo-Renaissance building designed by Adolf Láng and built on today's Andrássy Avenue between 1877 and 1879. That location is referred to as \\"Old Academy of Music\\" and commemorated by a 1934 plaque made by Zoltán Farkas. It was repurchased by the academy in the 1980s, and is now officially known as \\"Ferenc Liszt Memorial and Research Center.\\" Replacing the \\"Old Academy of Music\\", the Academy moved into a building erected in 1907 at the corner of Király Street and Liszt Ferenc square. It serves as a centre for higher education, music training, and concert hall. The Art Nouveau style building is one of the most well known in Budapest. It was designed by Flóris Korb and Kálmán Giergl at the request of Baron Gyula Wlassics, who was the Minister of Culture at that time. The façade is dominated by a statue of Liszt (sculpted by Alajos Stróbl). The inside of the building is decorated with frescoes, Zsolnay ceramics, and several statues (among them that of Béla Bartók and Frédéric Chopin). Originally the building also had stained glass windows, made by Miksa Róth. Other facilities used by the Academy are the Budapest Teacher Training College, located in the former National Music School on Semmelweis Street, a secondary school (Bartók Béla Secondary School of Music, Instrument Making and Repair), and a student dormitory. Ever since its foundation, the Academy has been the most prestigious music university operating in Hungary. A major development in its history was the recent establishment of a new, independent Folk Music Faculty. The Franz Liszt Academy of Music is as much a living monument to Hungary's continued musical life, as it is to the country's musical past. Its president (rector) is Andrea Vigh.

The Swedes were attempting to capture the Jasna Góra monastery in Częstochowa. Their month-long siege, however, was unsuccessful, as a small force consisting of monks from the Jasna Góra monastery led by their Prior and supported by local volunteers, mostly from the szlachta (Polish nobility), fought off the numerically superior Germans (who were hired by Sweden), saved their sacred icon, the Black Madonna of Częstochowa and, according to some accounts, turned the course of the war. Prelude On 6 August 1655, on this grim news, a council of war was held in the monastery of Jasna Gora under the leadership of Teofil Bronowski, the Priorship of Augustine Kordecki, and garrison commander of the fortress Colonel Jan Pawl, coat-of-arms Cellari. We begin the preparations of the fortified monastery of Jasna Gora for armed defense. ― Nova Gigantomachia in Claro Monte Czestochoviensi, 1658. The decade of the 1650s marked the end of the Golden Age of Poland, as it had become embroiled in a series of wars, particularly the Chmielnicki Uprising and the Russo-Polish War (1654–1667). In 1655 the Swedes decided to take advantage of the weakness of the Commonwealth to revive the Polish-Swedish War, which had been simmering for the past century. The Swedish forces quickly overran much of the Commonwealth territory. In late 1655 the Polish king, John II Casimir, took refuge in Habsburg Silesia. Despite that, the Commonwealth forces were still not defeated, and the Swedes decided to secure the fortified Jasna Góra monastery, an important fortress near the Silesian border, well known for its riches. As the Swedes approached, the monks feared that the Protestants would loot their Catholic sanctuary, seeing as the great European religious war of the 17th century, the Thirty Years' War, had barely ended. Thus the sacred icon was replaced with a copy and the original moved on November 7 in secret to the castle in Lubliniec, and later to the monastery in Głogówek. The monks also bought about 60 muskets, and ammunition, and hired 160 soldiers to support the 70 fighting-capable monks. The defence forces were also aided by about 80 volunteers, among them 20 nobles, including Stanisław Warszycki. The monastery had good artillery: 12–18 light cannons (from 2 to 6 pounders) and twelve 12 pounders. In the meantime the Swedes, seeing that they could not take the monastery by surprise, attempted to negotiate. On November 8 the Swedes (300 cavalry under Jan Wejhard) requested the right to garrison the monastery; however, they were refused the right to enter. The Prior of the monastery, Augustyn Kordecki, while repeatedly requesting aid from the King of Poland, John II Casimir, offered to recognise Charles X Gustav of Sweden as King to prevent a military conflict. He received a document from the Swedes that promised safety to the monastery, but on November 18 he refused to let another Swedish unit in. The Swedish commander, General Burchard Müller von der Luhnen, with a 2,250-strong force (1,800 cavalry, 100 dragoons, 300 infantry and 50 artillerymen) with 10 cannons (albeit light — eight 6 pounders and two 4 pounders), after futile negotiations with Kordecki, decided to start the siege, which would continue until the night of December 26 to 27. The battle Plan of Jasna Góra monastery. Click on the image to see more detailed explanation. The siege began on November 18. The Swedes had a numerical advantage, but inferior artillery compared to that mounted in the monastery. On November 28 the besieged under the leadership of Piotr Czarniecki made a surprise sortie and destroyed two Swedish cannons. Negotiations followed, which bore no fruit — the Swedes arrested two monks but released them afterwards. As Kordecki did not agree to surrender the monastery, the fighting resumed. Near the end of November the Swedes received reinforcements — about 600 men with 3 cannons. On December 10 the Swedes brought in heavy siege artillery — two 24-pounders and 4 12-pounders, with 200 men. The Swedes finally had heavier caliber artillery than the defenders, although they still had fewer cannons than the monastery. At that point the Swedish besiegers were at the height of their strength, with 3,200 men (including 800 Poles who served the Swedish king) and 17 cannons. The Swedish army at Jasna Góra, although commonly referred to as 'the Swedes', was in fact mostly composed of German mercenaries. With the new artillery the Swedes significantly damaged the northern walls, as well as the bastion of Holy Trinity. Swedish siege of Jasna Góra in 1655. Oil on canvas, 17th century.

On the 14 December the Poles made another sortie, destroying one of the Swedes' redoubts as well as one of the 24-pounders. The Swedes then started to shell the south side, as well as digging tunnel. On December 20, the Poles led by Stefan Zamoyski sortied again, this time during the day shortly after noon. They destroyed two cannons and killed most of the miners at the tunnel. On December 24 Kordecki refused to surrender once again, and the Swedes went back to shelling the northern side. During one of their most heavy barrages the second of their 24-pounders malfunctioned and was destroyed. The Swedes then demanded a ransom of 60,000 talars to lift the siege, but Kordecki replied that while he would have paid before the fighting, the monastery now needed the money for repairs. Finally, on December 27, the Swedes decided to withdraw. They made several small attempts to take the monastery by surprise in the weeks to come, as the fortress became an increasingly important center for the local anti-Swedish guerrillas. The Polish side reported a few dozen casualties, while the Swedes, several hundreds. Aftermath Defence of Jasna Gora. Nineteenth century relief The fortified Jasna Góra monastery was the only stronghold in Poland that the Swedish invaders failed to capture. Historians disagree over the importance of the defence of Jasna Góra in turning the tide of the war. In December, when the Swedes lifted their siege, the Polish forces had begun to gain the upper hand, and the defence of Jasna Góra, an important symbol for the Poles, was certainly a significant morale boost. However, to what extent the defence of Jasna Góra motivated the defenders is still an open issue. In 1658 Augustyn Kordecki published a book, Nova Gigantomachia in Claro Monte Czestochoviensi, in which he focused on the importance of the defense of Jasna Góra. A year later, Polish author Stanisław Kobierzycki built upon his description in Obsidio Clari Montis Częstochoviensis. In the nineteenth century, the defense of the monastery became widely popularized in a novel, The Deluge, by Henryk Sienkiewicz, one of the most popular Polish writers of his time and a Nobel Prize-winner (a 1974 movie was based on the novel). The Siege of Jasna Gora is commemorated on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Warsaw, with the inscription \\"JASNA GORA 18 XI-26 XII 1655\\".

(1992). Film Noir: An Encyclopedic Reference to the American Style (3rd ed.). Woodstock, New York: The Overlook Press. mystery film directed by Wim Wenders and executive produced by Francis Ford Coppola. The screenplay was written by Ross Thomas and Dennis O'Flaherty, based on the novel of the same name by Joe Gores. It stars Frederic Forrest as detective story writer Dashiell Hammett, who gets caught up in a mystery very much like one of his own stories. Marilu Henner plays Hammett's neighbor, Kit Conger, and Peter Boyle plays Jimmy Ryan, an old friend from Hammett's days as a Pinkerton agent. The film was entered into the 1982 Cannes Film Festival. Plot San Francisco-based Dashiell Hammett, trying to put his Pinkerton detective days behind him while establishing himself as a writer, finds himself drawn back into his old life one last time by the irresistible call of friendship and to honor a debt. In 1928, Hammett, known to his librarian neighbor Kit and other acquaintances as \\"Sam\\" is holed up in a cheap apartment, hard at work at his typewriter each day. He drinks heavily, smokes too much and has coughing fits. One day, a friend and mentor from his Pinkerton days, Jimmy Ryan, turns up with a request, that Hammett help him track down a Chinese prostitute named Crystal Ling in the Chinatown district of San Francisco, an area Hammett is more familiar with than Ryan. Hammett is soon pulled into a multi-layered plot, losing the only copy of his manuscript, wondering how and why Ryan has vanished, being followed by a tough-talking gunsel, discovering a million- dollar blackmail scheme and being deceived by the diabolical Crystal, right up to a final confrontation near the San Francisco wharf.

Coppola and the film's studio, Orion, were dissatisfied with the original cut and reshot nearly the entire film. This has subsequently led to allegations that the majority of the final cut was not directed by Wenders but by Coppola. Wenders made a short film called Reverse Angle documenting his disputes with Coppola surrounding the making of Hammett. As The A.V. Club review states, \\"A Coppola or Wenders commentary track might have sorted things out a bit—or at least settled an old score—but the bare-bones DVD release leaves viewers with a fascinating mess\\". The reviewer never reveals the source of his information and the degree and nature of Coppola's involvement in the directing of the film remains open. The confusion surrounding the making of the movie \\"would certainly explain some of the film's oddities\\". In a 2015 interview, Wenders claimed that he directed the entirety of the released version. He also stated that the first version was junked and is now lost. Casting Boyle took over the role of Jimmy Ryan from Brian Keith, who left allegedly because the lengthy production conflicted with other commitments. Keith can be seen in some long shots in the film. A number of actors from the \\"Golden Age\\" of Hollywood were cast in the film, including Hank Worden, Royal Dano and Elisha Cook, Jr. (who played Wilmer \\"the gunsel\\" in John Huston's 1941 film The Maltese Falcon).

S. Arthur — was a popular 19th-century American author. He is famously known for his temperance novel Ten Nights in a Bar-Room and What I Saw There (1854), which helped demonize alcohol in the eyes of the American public. His stories, written with compassion and sensitivity, articulated and spread values and ideas that were associated with “respectable middle class “ life in America. He also believed greatly in the transformative and restorative power of love as is shown in one of his stories, \\"An Angel in Disguise\\". He was also the author of dozens of stories for Godey's Lady's Book, the most popular American monthly magazine in the antebellum era, and he published and edited his own Arthur's Home Magazine, a periodical in the Godey's model, for many years. Virtually forgotten now, Arthur did much to articulate and disseminate the values, beliefs, and habits that defined respectable, decorous middle- class life in America. Biography Born in Newburgh, New York, Arthur lived as a child in Fort Montgomery, New York. By 1820, Arthur's father, who was a miller, had relocated to Baltimore, Maryland, where Arthur briefly attended local schools. At age fourteen, Arthur apprenticed to a tailor, but poor eyesight and a general lack of aptitude for physical labor led him to seek other work. He then found employment with a wholesale merchandiser and later as an agent for an investment concern, a job that took him briefly to Louisville, Kentucky. Otherwise, he lived as a young adult in Baltimore. Smitten by literature, Arthur devoted as much time as he could to reading and fledgling attempts to write. By 1830, he had begun to appear in local literary magazines. That year he contributed poems under his own name and pseudonyms to a gift book called The Amethyst. Also during this time he participated in an informal literary coterie called the Seven Stars (the name was drawn from that of the tavern in which they met), whose members also included Edgar Allan Poe. =Professional success of T. S. Arthur= The 1830s saw Arthur mount a number of efforts to become a professional author and publisher. All failed, but collectively they gave Arthur numerous chances to hone his craft. In 1838 he co-published The Baltimore Book, a gift book that included a short tale contributed by Poe called \\"Slope.\\" Toward the end of the decade, Arthur published in ephemeral format a novel called Insubordination that in 1842 appeared in hardcover. In 1840 he wrote a series of newspaper articles on the Washingtonian Temperance Society, a local organization formed by working-class artisans and mechanics to counter the life-ruining effects of drink. The articles were widely reprinted and helped fuel the establishment of Washingtonian groups across the country. Arthur’s newspaper sketches were collected in book form as Six Nights with the Washingtonians (1842). Six Nights went through many editions and helped establish Arthur in the public eye as an author associated with the temperance movement. 1840 also saw Arthur place his first short tale in Godey's Lady's Book. Called \\"Tired of Housekeeping,\\" its subject is a middle-class family who struggles to supervise recalcitrant cooks and servants. Encouraged by his success, Arthur moved to Philadelphia in 1841 to be near the offices of America’s most popular home magazines. He continued to write tales for Godey’s and other periodicals. Almost yearly he issued collected editions of his tales and published novel- length narratives as well. He also authored children's stories, conduct manuals, a series of state histories, and even an income-tax primer. Interested in publishing a magazine under his own name, he launched (after several aborted efforts) the monthly Arthur’s Home Magazine in 1852. Helped by a very capable assistant, Virginia Townsend, the magazine survived until several years after Arthur’s death in 1885. The magazine featured Arthur’s own tales and other original fare, as well as articles and stories reprinted from other sources. In 1854, for example, Arthur published, apparently with permission, Charles Dickens' Hard Times. 1854 was also the year Arthur published Ten Nights in a Bar-Room. The story of a small-town miller (perhaps based on Arthur's father) who gives up his trade to open a tavern, the novel’s narrator is an infrequent visitor who over the course of several years traces the physical and moral decline of the proprietor, his family, and the town’s citizenry due to alcohol. The novel sold well, but insinuated itself in the public consciousness largely on the basis of a very popular stage version that appeared soon after the book. The play remained in continuous production well into the 20th century when at least two movie versions were made. Arthur died on March 6, 1885, aged 75, at his home in Philadelphia; his death was attributed to \\"kidney troubles\\". He is buried at The Woodlands.  Critical appreciation  Arthur enjoyed great popularity while he lived, but was not well regarded by the era’s literati. His old acquaintance Poe, for example, wrote in Graham's Magazine that Arthur was \\"uneducated and too fond of mere vulgarities to please a refined taste.\\"Oberholtzer, Ellis Paxson. The Literary History of Philadelphia Philadelphia: George W. Jacobs & Co., 1906: 270. . An unsigned article in 1873 claimed that \\"the world is the better for his having lived\\" and his social reform writings, while also admitting that \\"men of literary pretensions take pride in sneering at Mr. Arthur's writings, and declaring that they never read them\\".Sánchez, María Carla. Reforming the World: Social Activism and the Problem of Fiction in Nineteenth-Century America. Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 2008: 177. . Conscious of his own lack of brilliance, Arthur thought stories should impart beneficial life lessons by means of plainly written, realistically depicted scenes. Though often marked by moralism and sentimentalism, Arthur's writing at its best—as in Ten Nights in a Bar-Room—is both brisk and poignant. Arthur's ideas may seem simplistic or even oppressive today, but many readers in his time found him relevant, helpful, reassuring, and compelling.

It was a small bipedal omnivore. Etymology This dinosaur was originally named Walkeria maleriensis by Sankar Chatterjee in 1987, in honor of British paleontologist Alick Walker. However, since the original generic name was found to be preoccupied by a bryozoan, the name Alwalkeria was created in 1994 by Chatterjee and Ben Creisler. The species name maleriensis is a reference to the Maleri Formation, in southern India, where its fossils were found. Description Life restoration The only known specimen, holotype ISI R306 is incomplete and consists of parts of the front ends of the upper and lower jaws, 28 incomplete vertebrae from all parts of the spinal column, most of a femur, and an astragalus (ankle bone). The partial skull is about 4 centimeters long (1.5 in). Although material of Alwalkeria is limited, the spacing and shape of the teeth strongly resemble those of Eoraptor. As in Eoraptor, a gap separates the teeth of the premaxillary and the maxillary bones of the upper jaw. Other similarities in the skull of the two animals also link them on morphological grounds.Langer, M.C. 2004. Basal Saurischia. In: Weishampel, D.B., Dodson, P., & Osmolska, H. (Eds.). The Dinosauria (2nd Edition). Berkeley: University of California Press. Pp. 25–46. Estimates suggest that Alwalkeria was at best long.Holtz, Thomas R., Jr.; Rey, Luis V. (2007). Dinosaurs: the most complete, up-to-date encyclopedia for dinosaur lovers of all ages. New York: Random House. Gregory S. Paul estimated its weight at 2 kg and length at 1.5 m in 2010.Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 126 =Dentition and diet= This dinosaur also had heterodont dentition in the upper jaw, meaning that the teeth are differently shaped depending on their position in the jaw. Similarly to Eoraptor and basal sauropodomorphs, the front teeth are slender and straight, while the teeth in the sides of the jaw are curved backwards like those of predatory theropods, although none of these teeth are serrated. This arrangement of teeth is neither clearly herbivorous nor clearly carnivorous, which suggests that this dinosaur was an omnivore with a varied diet, including insects, small vertebrates, and plant material.

The femur and the astragalus are clearly dinosaurian however, with the latter possessing saurischian characteristics. Classification and phylogeny Chatterjee 1987 originally described Alwalkeria as a basal theropod.Chatterjee, S. 1987. A new theropod dinosaur from India with remarks on the Gondwana-Laurasia connection in the Late Cretaceous. In: McKenzie, G.D. (Ed.). Gondwana Six: Stratigraphy, Sedimentology, and Paleontology. Geophysical Monograph 41. Washington, D.C.: American Geophysical Union. Pp. 183–189. In 1996, Loyal et al. agreed with this classification.R. S. Loyal, A. Khosla, and A. Sahni. 1996. Gondwanan dinosaurs of India: affinities and palaeobiogeography. Memoirs of the Queensland Museum 39(3):627-638 Paul (1988) understood Alwalkeria as a link between herrerasaurids and the genus Protoavis, and hence assigned it to Herrerasauridae based on features of the femur.Paul, 1988. Predatory dinosaurs of the world. Simon and Schuster, New York. A New York Academy of Sciences Book. 464 pp. However Langer (2004) and Martínez and Alcober (2009), observed that Alwalkeria was too primitive to be a theropod and considered it a basal saurischian.Langer, M.C. 2004. Basal Saurischia. In: Weishampel, D.B., Dodson, P., & Osmolska, H. (Eds.). The Dinosauria (2nd Edition). Berkeley: University of California Press. Pp. 25–46.R. N. Martínez and O. A. Alcober. 2009. A basal sauropodomorph (Dinosauria: Saurischia) from the Ischigualasto Formation (Triassic, Carnian) and the early evolution of Sauropodomorpha. PLoS ONE 4(2 (e4397)):1-12 The current scientific consensus is that this genus does indeed occupy a basal position within Saurischia. Alwalkeria has not been included in a cladistic analysis, but its similarities to Eoraptor suggest it may have held a similar position in the dinosaur family tree. However, the position of Eoraptor is disputed, with one analysis finding it within the order Saurischia, but basal to the Theropoda-Sauropodomorpha split (Langer 2004). Paul Sereno insisted that Eoraptor was a basal theropod.Sereno, P.C. 1999. The evolution of dinosaurs. Science 284: 2137-2147. Others place Eoraptor outside of Dinosauria completely.Fraser, N.C., Padian, K., Walkden, G.M., & Davis, A.L.M. 2002. Basal dinosauriform remains from Britain and the diagnosis of the Dinosauria. Palaeontology 45(1): 79-95. = Distinguishing anatomical features= A diagnosis is a statement of the anatomical features of an organism (or group) that collectively distinguish it from all other organisms. Some, but not all, of the features in a diagnosis are also autapomorphies. An autapomorphy is a distinctive anatomical feature that is unique to a given organism or group. According to Chatterjee (1987) Alwalkeria can be distinguished based on the following characteristics:Chatterjee, S. 1987. A new theropod dinosaur from India with remarks on the Gondwana-Laurasia connection in the Late Cretaceous. In: McKenzie, G.D. (Ed.). Gondwana Six: Stratigraphy, Sedimentology, and Paleontology. Geophysical Monograph 41. Washington, D.C.: American Geophysical Union. Pp. 183–189. * an excavation is present in the bases of the dorsal neural arches (debated because the vertebrae likely don't belong to Alwalkeria) * the presence of a highly expanded femoral head * the fourth trochanter is very prominent Several features make Alwalkeria unique among basal dinosaurs, such as its lack of serrated teeth, the mandibular symphysis being proportionally wider than almost any other known dinosaur, and there is a very large articulation between the fibula and the ankle. Paleoecology =Provenance and occurrence= The only known specimen of Alwalkeria was recovered in the Godavari Valley locality from the Maleri Formation of Andhra Pradesh, India. The remains were collected by S. Chatterjee in 1974 in red mudstone that was deposited during the Carnian stage of the Triassic period, approximately 235 to 228 million years ago. The specimen is housed in the collection of the Indian Statistical Institute, in Kolkata, India. =Fauna and habitat= The Maleri Formation has been interpreted as being the site of an ancient lake or river. Material of the prosauropods Jaklapallisaurus and Nambalia have been found in the Maleri Formation, as well as intermediate prosauropod remains, and Alwalkeria is the only named carnivorous dinosaur species from this locality.

It was arranged by the composer from incidental music he provided for a theatrical entertainment commissioned for Albert I, Prince of Monaco in 1919. The original score contained eight numbers, including two songs for tenor, and a choral passage. These numbers were not included in the published suite, which has four movements. History In 1918 Raoul Gunsbourg, manager of the Opéra de Monte- Carlo, invited Fauré to write a short work for the theatre.Nectoux, pp. 335–336 The impetus came from Fauré's friend and former teacher Camille Saint- Saëns, who suggested to Prince Albert that he should commission Fauré to write a short work for the Monte Carlo theatre. Fauré's opera Pénélope (1913) had been premiered there, and although he felt Gunsbourg had not fully appreciated the opera, Fauré accepted the new commission.Nectoux, p. 326 He was director of the Paris Conservatoire, and his official duties limited the time he had for composition.Jones, p. 110 For the proposed \\"choreographic divertissement\\", also billed as a \\"comédie lyrique\\", he reused material from earlier compositions.Nectoux, pp. 337–338 Fauré proposed a story based on the poem \\"Clair de lune\\" from the collection Fêtes galantes by Paul Verlaine (1869). Fauré had set the poem to music in 1887.Nectoux, p. 172 The title of the new work was taken from the opening lines of the poem. The librettist of Pénélope, René Fauchois, provided a scenario accordingly. In the early 20th century the commedia dell'arte of the 16th and 17th centuries provided inspiration for a number of musical works, including Schoenberg's melodrama Pierrot lunaire (1912) and Stravinsky's ballet Pulcinella (1920).Schiavo, Paul. Notes to Seattle Symphony Media CD SSM1004, 2014 Fauchois' story has a commedia dell'arte troupe spying on the amorous encounters of aristocrats in its audience.Duchen, p. 196; and Nectoux, pp. 336–337 The scenery for the production was based on Watteau's \\"L'Escarpolette\\".Nectoux, p. 338 The Monte Carlo production was such a success that Albert Carré put the work on at the Opéra-Comique in Paris in March 1920, where it was performed more than 100 times over the next thirty years. The Fauré scholar Jean-Michel Nectoux describes it as paradoxical that Fauré's most frequently performed stage work is also his least ambitious.Nectoux, p. 339 Score The eight movements of the divertissement were almost all drawn from earlier works of Fauré: # Ouverture (from an abandoned 1869 symphony) # Pastorale (the only wholly new movement) # Madrigal (Op. 35, 1884; for chorus and orchestra) # Le Plus doux chemin (Op. 87, No. 1; for tenor and orchestra) # Menuet (extensively reworked from the 1869 symphony) # Clair de lune (Op. 46, No. 2; for tenor and orchestra) # Gavotte (from the 1869 symphony) # Pavane (Op. 50, 1887) The suite drawn from the work has remained one of Fauré's most popular works. It was published by Durand et cie in 1919. It is scored for 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 2 horns, 2 trumpets, timpani, harp and strings.\\"Masques et bergamasques\\", International Music Score Library Project, retrieved 3 March 2018 The suite, which has a typical playing time of about 14 minutes,Timings from recordings conducted by Ernest Ansermet (Decca CD 00028947854876, 2013), Neville Marriner (Decca CD 00028941055224, 2007), Michel Plasson (EMI CD 0724357373258, 2000), and Yan Pascal Tortelier (Chandos CD CHAN9416, 1995) consists of four of the purely orchestral movements: ;Ouverture The movement is in 2/2 time in F major, marked Allegro molto vivo, with a metronome mark of minim = 152. It begins with a swift, light theme marked leggiero, and maintains an unflagging tempo throughout, including two passages marked espressivo.Fauré pp. 1–21 After the first performance, Fauré wrote to his wife, \\"Reynaldo Hahn says that the ouverture sounds like Mozart imitating Fauré – an amusing idea.\\"Southon, Nicolas, Notes to Alpha CD ALPHA228, 2016 The typical playing time of the overture is about 3½ minutes. ;Menuet The second movement, in 3/4 time in F major, is marked Tempo di minuetto Allegro moderato, with a metronome mark of crotchet = 108. There are no dynamic extremes in the movement: the quietest marking is piano and the loudest, forte.Fauré, pp. 22–35 Nectoux comments that the movement verges on pastiche, and remarks that its most characterful phrase is taken note for note from Fauré's 1910 Preludes for Piano, Op. 103.Nectoux, p. 338 The menuet has a typical playing time of little under 3 minutes. ;Gavotte The third movement is in D minor. It is marked Allegro vivo; metronome, crotchet = 100. A middle section is marked by a switch to D major, before the movement resumes the first theme in D minor.Fauré, pp. 36–51 Like the ouverture, the gavotte is taken from one of Fauré's earliest compositions. Nectoux refers to a piano version from 1869, and an orchestral version largely the same as in Masques et bergamasques in the Suite d'orchestre, Op. 20 (1873–74). The typical playing time of the gavotte is a little over 3 minutes. ;Pastorale The suite ends with a movement in D major, in 6/4 time, marked Andantino tranqillo, at dotted minim = 46.Fauré, p. 52 The Pastorale is the only part of the suite specially written for the 1919 divertissement. Nectoux rates it as \\"vintage Faure\\", citing \\"consecutive block harmonics, wide melodic leaps … the juxtaposition of melodic segments to form the exposition and the ease with which the developments unfold\\". In his view, the sweetness of the movement is tempered by expressive harmonic clashes such as D sharp against E natural, and C sharp against D natural.Nectoux, p. 337 As the movement nears its conclusion, Fauré brings back the opening theme of the ouverture as a countermelody.Fauré, p. 61 The movement ends quietly, but in Nectoux's view the composer was right to move the Pastorale from its place near the beginning of the divertissement to be the last movement of the suite: \\"without doubt the crowning glory of Masques et bergamasques\\", and Fauré's \\"final farewell to the orchestra\\". The Pastorale is the longest of the four movements in the suite, with a typical playing time of about 4 minutes.

Indravarman's ancestors According to the inscriptions of the Práḥ Kô temple, desecrated on Monday, 25 January 880 AD (Foundation stele K. 713 a)Bhattacharya, 2009, pp. 25-41 three pairs of temple towers for three deceased kings and their queens were built by him as a kind of \\"memorial temple\\", as can be seen by the inscriptions on the door frames of the towers: The central towers were dedicated to Jayavarman II under his posthumous name Parameśvara and his queen Dharaṇīndradevī (K. 320a),Pou, 2002, pp. 55-57 the northern ones for Rudravarman (consecrated as Rudreśvara) and Rajendradevī (K. 318a), his mother's parents, and the southern towers for Pṛthivīndravarman (desecrated as Pṛthivīndreśvara) and Pṛthivīndradevī (K. 315 a)Pou, 2002, pp. 41-43 and K. 713 b). Indravarman I's wife, Indradevi, was a descendant of the royal families of Sambhupura, Vyadhapura, and Aninditapura (Funan). Pṛthivīndravarman and Rudravarman Actually the classical succession of kings in the 9th century was disputed by some epigraphists such as Kamaleswar Bhattacharya and Karl-Heinz Golzio. Since the poor activity and records of Jayavarman III, and the presence of the dedicated towers of Preah Ko, they had interpreted some Sanskrit inscriptions at Roluos as proof of existence of two kings between him and Indravarman: Rudravarman and Pṛthivīndravarman. According to the Lolei inscription K. 324 of Indravarman's successor Yaśovarman I, dated 8 July 893 AD, Rudravarman was the younger brother of the mother of 'Dharaṇīndradevī, the queen consort of Jayavarman II and mother of Jayavarman III (whom Indravarman mentioned under his posthumous name Viṣṇuloka in his Bakong inscription K. 826 stanza XXX, dated 881/82 AD.Bhattacharya, 2009, p. 58 Although Michael Vickery, has pointed out that they are not mentioned in later times and that these \\"-varman\\" ancestors of Indravarman may easily be explained as posthumous upgrading of the king’s parents, which perhaps already occurred within their lifetimes, the following facts should be taken into account: 1) The inscriptions of the 9th century gave an account of events, i.e. genealogies and relative chronologies, referring to that century itself; 2) One should have great doubts concerning the reliability of later inscriptions that record wrong reign dates and stories about family connections never heard of before, which was pointed out especially by Vickery;Vickery, The Reign of Sūryavarman I and Royal Factionalism at Angkor, Journal of South East Asian Studies 16, pp. 226-244 3) later inscriptions omitted very often not only these two kings, but also other important kings (Jayavarman IV mentioned only his three predecessors; Rājendravarman II, the founder of a new dynasty, has omitted in his Bàksĕi Čaṃkrŏṅ inscription K. 286, dated 23 February 948, all his predecessors with the exception of Jayavarman II and Jayavarman III); 4) In the 9th century the \\"-varman\\"-title was exclusively reserved for kings (by the way, Rudravarman was no father of a king); 5) It is surprising that later inscriptions were considered more trustworthy than contemporary ones, thus twisting things instead of following a historio-critical method. Indravarman's monuments and public buildings While Jayavarman II was credited for the founding of the Khmer Empire ca. 800 AD, Indravarman I was credited for an extensive building program. He set the foundations for the future Angkorian kings to follow. The king's first act was to perform a public service for his subjects by building an irrigation network for the rice fields. The goal was usually achieved by constructing a large reservoir to retain water during the monsoon season and then release it during the dry season through a network of canals and channels. And in Hindu mythology the reservoir also represents an ocean and the temple-mountain represents Mount Meru, the home of the gods.Higham, 2001, pp. 59–63 The king and his Brahman advisors performed many rituals throughout the year to reinforce this belief; for example, the ritual of rain-making performed before the rice planting season. Immediately, after Indravarman I acceded, he declared in his Práḥ Kô inscription: \\"In five days from today I shall begin digging, etc.\\"Bhattacharya, 2009, p. 31 Dig he did with a reservoir of an immense size: the Indratāṭaka was the biggest reservoir ever built before his time being long by wide. However, later rulers out-built him and made his reservoir look small. Now dry, it could have held about 7.5 million cubic metres of water during the monsoon season. The king's second act was - as mentioned above - to build shrines and dedicate them to his god, ancestors, and parents. At his capital city Hariharālaya, Roluos at present, Indravarman I built Práḥ Kô (Preah Ko), which he dedicated to his maternal father and grandfather, and the dynasty founder Jayavarman II. His palace was located at Prei Monti.Higham, C., 2014, Early Mainland Southeast Asia, Bangkok: River Books Co., Ltd., The king's third act was to build a temple- mountain (or complete a construction begun by Jayavarman III) which he dedicated to a liṅga dedicated to his patron Hindu deity Shiva called after himself. Cœdès identified thirteen Angkorian kings after Indravarman built such shrines for these dual purposes (state and memorial shrine). The shrines were built with stepped pyramids surrounded by lakes. In the centre of the capital of Hariharālaya, Indravarman I built Bakong surrounded by double- walled moats. The Bakong was his state shrine, therefore, it also housed the official [ShivaŚiva]'s liṅga. Although his shrines are bigger than his predecessors, they are modest compared to the later shrines. It was also the first time in Khmer architecture that nāgas were employed as guardians for the bridge between the human world and the temple, house of gods. Succession Indravarman I died in 889, receiving the posthumous name Isvaraloka, and was succeeded by his son Yaśovarman I.

It is regarded as an occasional pest of ginger and turmeric. Grass demon butterfly Udaspes folus, the grass demon Description It is a small butterfly with a wingspan of about 4 to 4.8 cm. It is black with a large white spot on the upperside of the hindwing and several smaller whites spots on the forewing. The underside of its wings is mostly white with brown edges and spots. Range Sri Lanka, India, Nepal and onto Myanmar, China, India, Indochina, Taiwan, Thailand, Malaysian Peninsula, Singapore, Borneo, IndonesiaHong Kong biodiversity database (Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department, Government of Hong Kong) Status Not rare in India. Rare or very rare in certain parts of its global range. This butterfly is seen chiefly during the monsoon, perhaps due to its larval host plants growing at this time of the year. Habitat The grass demon is to be found in deciduous and semi-evergreen forests. It prefers the edges of open spaces rather than the deep forest shade or open sunlight. It is most abundant in the more open regions of hilly jungle. It is also encountered on the plains at some distance from such terrain. It occurs up to in the hills of South India and up to in the Himalayas. Habits The grass demon prefers forest edges or clearings where dappled light is present. Its black and white colouration may have evolved to take advantage of the dappled light in these areas. The pied pattern which seems prominent in the open is effectively disruptive in the shade and the butterfly is difficult to locate once it settles down. It is a bold insect and not easily disturbed. It usually flies in the shade among bushes and under trees keeping low and close to the ground. From time to time, it takes short flights, and, occasionally, much longer excursions into the open clearings. Its flight is quick and the path is very erratic making it very difficult to track when in flight. File:Udaspes folus-Kadavoor-2016-04-12-001.jpgUnderside File:Grass Demon (Udaspes folus) UP.

This butterfly also has a unique wing flashing display most often seen just after it has alighted on a leaf. It will move its hindwings down toward the leaf surface. When the hindwings are about halfway down the forewings also start moving downwards. On the upward beat both wings are moved simultaneously till the hindwings come together. Then it again begins the downward beat. Each beat is performed very slowly and the butterfly is very conspicuous during this time. This display is unique since no other peninsular Indian butterfly is known to display the capability of moving forewings and hindwings separately. The grass demon is a nectar lover and has a long proboscis compared to body size. This makes it easy to get to nectar of flowers with long corolla tubes. In gardens, the common periwinkle (Vinca rosea) and Lantana are its favourite flowers. It rarely visits bird or dung droppings. It is fond of water and often seen perched on a stone in a stream-bed. Life cycle Leaf cell Egg The butterflies emerge in February or March and lay eggs before they die. The eggs remain dormant till the rains, that is, usually the month of May, when they hatch. The caterpillars pupate in September and October and the adults emerge four to six months later. In some cases the caterpillars pupate later and in these cases the pupa remain dormant, throughout the dry season, till May when the rains begin. Larva =Eggs= The female normally sits on the underside of the leaf of the host plant and lays a single egg. The egg is reddish and appears smooth and dome shaped. When about to hatch it turns white with a red top. =Larva= Pupa Soon after hatching, the caterpillar does not consume the eggshell completely and it makes itself a spacious cell and hides inside it. The caterpillar is sluggish and comes out to feed only at night. Even when disturbed it is reluctant to leave its cell. The caterpillar is a light uniform leaf green colour with a dark green pulsating line on the back and a relatively small, dark head. The full grown larva has the habit of resting with the first three segments contracted, so as to give a humped appearance. It always lies closely applied to the leaf, by turning over a triangular piece from the edge onto the upper surface over itself. Specific host plants include Zingiber zerumbet. =Pupa= Pupa Pupation takes place on the same plant within a cell. The pupa is long and cylindrical, watery green in colour. It has a long conical projection in front of the head. The eyes are easily seen but do not protrude out of the outline of the pupa. The pupa broadens towards the shoulders and the abdomen gradually tapers to the last segment. The most striking characteristic of the pupa is its proboscis. It is long and thin generally extending up to and a little beyond the tip of the abdomen. The pupa is the same colour of the caterpillar and unmarked. It is covered in a thin layer of white powder. The body band is neither too tight nor too loose and allows the pupa to wriggle if disturbed. Butterfly just after emerging out of its larva Food plants The grass demon feeds on ginger, turmeric, and their relatives Curcuma aromatica, Curcuma decipiens, Hedychium sp. and other plants of family Sctiaminae. It has also been recorded on Zingiber sp. and on grasses.

Swedish Empire forces had occupied the Polish capital without fighting in early September 1655 (see Deluge (history)). In late April 1656, Poles and Lithuanians began the siege, with the purpose of recapturing their capital. They were successful, but later lost the city for a second time after a battle held on July 28–30, 1656 (see Battle of Warsaw (1656)).  Introduction  Swedish Army entered Warsaw on September 8, 1655. The city immediately became administrative center of Swedish administration of occupied Poland. First months of Swedish rule were not marked by any atrocities, but after some time, when it became clear that Sweden would not be able to control Poland for a longer period of time, the invaders began looting Warsaw. The city was robbed of everything that was of value, including such details, as window frames, marble fireplaces, floors, tiles, columns and stairs. All goods were loaded on boats and transported along the Vistula to the Baltic Sea. By the spring of 1656, residents of Warsaw suffered from hunger and epidemic. All shops had been robbed by the Swedes, and due to dangerous situation in the countryside, food was not delivered to the city.  Beginning of the Siege  In early spring of 1656, the army of Charles X Gustav was surrounded at the confluence of the Vistula and San river. Swedes managed to escape total annihilation, and after a daring manoeuver, they headed northwards, back to Warsaw. They were chased by slow-moving Lithuanian Army under Pawel Jan Sapieha, which reached Lublin on April 20. Meanwhile, Charles X Gustav, after a short rest, left Warsaw (April 17), and marched with his soldiers to Greater Poland, to fight local anti-Swedish insurrection and Polish armies of Stefan Czarniecki and Jerzy Lubomirski. Charles left in Warsaw a garrison of some 2,500, under Arvid Wittenberg. On April 24, Sapieha’s army of some 6,000 reached Warsaw’s suburb of Praga, located on the right bank of the Vistula. The Lithuanians built a pontoon bridge, through which they transferred several units on the left bank of the river (April 30). To prevent this, Arvid Wittenberg sent a unit of reiters, which was annihilated after a short skirmish. In late May 1656, another Lithuanian army, under Hetman Wincenty Korwin Gosiewski, joined Sapieha’s forces.  Swedish Preparations  In mid April 1656, Swedish garrison of some 2,500 began preparing for the siege. Several buildings in Warsaw were fortified, including the Dominican Abbey, the Holy Spirit Church, Palace of Bishops of Kraków and Kraków Gate. Along city walls, trenches were dug and obstacles for cavalry were placed. Since Swedish forces were inadequate to man whole wall, the defenders concentrated their forces in a complex of large buildings, with the Holy Spirit Church in the middle, which prevented entry into the heart of the city. Swedish commandant, Arvid Wittenberg, located his headquarters in the Royal Castle. On May 6, Wittenberg ordered to burn several houses located in Krakowskie Przedmieście, and along Dluga and Senatorska Streets. On May 7, the Swedes burned a number of buildings on Freta and Mostowa Streets. At the same time, Swedish engineers turned monasteries, palaces and churches along Krakowskie Przedmieście into fortified strongholds. Furthermore, all buildings in the district of New Town.  Arrival of Polish Army  On April 26, 1656, King Jan Kazimierz left Lwow, and together with Polish Army headed northwards. On May 12, the Poles reached Zamość, and in mid-May, first infantry regiments, together with artillery, joined the Lithuanians. First, ill-prepared attack took place on May 17, but after six hours it failed. On the next day, a Swedish unit under Colonel Forgell left Warsaw and in a surprise attack, captured two cannons, killing a number of soldiers. King Jan Kazimierz arrived together with his Hetmans and main forces on May 30. On the same day, Polish infantry crossed the Vistula, on a pontoon bridge built by Lithuanians, taking positions in Ujazdów. The King himself resided in the Ujazdów Castle. On June 2, Jan Kazimierz ordered his Chancellor Stefan Korycinski, to contact Arvid Wittenberg with a generous offer of surrender. The Swedes rejected this, despite mediation of Austrian envoy, Franz Paul de Lisola. Soon afterwards, Polish forces were strengthened by the divisions of Jerzy Lubomirski and Stefan Czarniecki, which arrived on June 9. Altogether, Polish-Lithuanian Army consisted of some 29,000 soldiers (22,000 Poles, 7,000 Lithuanians), 18,000 pospolite ruszenie, and several thousand peasants. The Lithuanians remained in Praga, on the right bank of the Vistula, while Poles occupied positions on the left bank. Swedish garrison of Arvid Wittenberg had some 2,500 soldiers - 1,300 infantry, 300 dragoons and 900 reiters. Apart from Wittenberg, several notable Swedes were present in Warsaw, including Bengt Gabrielsson Oxenstierna.  First Major Assault  During a meeting of Polish - Lithuanian commanders, Krzysztof Grodzicki suggested an assault from north, west and south. Main Polish effort was concentrated in southwest, especially in the fortified buildings of Krakowskie Przedmiescie, whose capture opened the way to the Royal Palace. Polish leaders hoped that after capture of external Swedish positions, Wittenberg would come to the conclusion that his situation was hopeless and capitulate. The assault was preceded by a barrage of Grodzicki’s artillery (June 3). In return, Wittenberg sent 200 infantry and two cavalry regiments for a surprise attack, which was repelled with heavy losses on both sides. Swedish commandant was aware of the fact that reinforcements, sent by Charles X Gustav were on the way. Main assault of the Commonwealth forces began in the morning of June 8, with some 10,000 armed peasants. After initial success, the Poles were forced to retreat. The attack was not a complete failure, as Polish forces captured the Palace of Bishops of Kraków, which became a convenient spot for the artillery. Another attack took place on June 11, and again it was fought off by the defenders. After this, Polish commandants realized that without heavy guns, which were kept in Zamość, capture of Warsaw was impossible.  Swedish Reinforcements  On June 13, Swedish division under Adolph John I, Count Palatine of Kleeburg, sent by Charles Gustav from Royal Prussia, reached Modlin, where it camped, preparing for crossing of the Narew. Another Swedish division, under Robert Douglas, Count of Skenninge, camped near the village of Pomiechowo. These units were blocked by the Lithuanians, supported by Hetman Jerzy Lubomirski, who joined them in the night of June 16/17. Swedish positions at the confluence of the Vistula and the Narwobug were well- fortified, and protected by both rivers. At the same time, however, with 6,000 men they were not strong enough to risk a frontal attack on the Commonwealth forces, so on June 23, most Polish forces returned to Warsaw, while Polish engineers built a second pontoon bridge over the Vistula.  Second Major Assault  In the course of the time, the situation of besieged Swedish soldiers deteriorated. Food supplies were low, and many deserted to the Polish side. At the same time, the Poles were reinforced with a division of Crimean Tatars, under Subchan Gazi Agi, which was sent to Warsaw by Vizier Sefer Gazi Aga. On June 26, while awaiting heavy artillery from Zamość, Jan Kazimierz urged Wittenberg to capitulate, but again was refused. On the next day, heavy cannons arrived, together with ammunition and infantry from Lwow. Artillery barrage immediately began, followed by an assault (June 28), in which mostly armed peasants took place. Polish king did not use his first-rate foreign mercenaries, as he wanted to save them for the future. Polish forces entered Warsaw as far as the Bernardine Abbey and Kazanowski Palace. Swedish defenders managed to keep their positions, but their situation was hopeless. Under the circumstances, Wittenberg asked Jan Kazimierz for permission to send a message to his king (June 29). This was rejected and Polish king demanded unconditional surrender.  Third and Fourth Major Assaults  In the night of June 29/30, thousands of armed peasants began the attack. After several hours of heavy fighting, Poles and Lithuanians managed to capture several fortified buildings. On June 30, at 9:00 a.m., Wittenberg asked for a two-hour truce to discuss the capitulation. During the negotiations, which took place in the Ossolinski Palace, Swedish side presented several demands, while Poles insisted on unconditional surrender. Finally, the negotiations broke, and the fourth assault began in the morning of July 1. This attack was successful, and Poles entered the heart of Warsaw. Wittenberg, realizing that his situation was hopeless, agreed to capitulate. The conditions of surrender, which consisted of fifteen points, were very mild, which angered Polish-Lithuanian soldiers. Swedish commanders, including Wittenberg and Oxenstierna were to be released back to their king, while their soldiers were to return to the Swedish Army, provided that they would not re-enter service for four months. On July 1, the 1,200 Swedish soldiers began to leave Warsaw. Wives and families of Swedish officers were loaded on boats and sent towards Toruń. Before that happened, Swedish dames were inspected, as many of them broke conditions of capitulation, and hid stolen valuables under their clothes. Since Polish rank and file vehemently protested against too mild conditions, King Jan Kazimierz decided to change them, and sent Swedish officers, together with Wittenberg, to a dungeon in Zamość.

He is the second king of Lyonesse, son of Felec of Cornwall and vassal of King Mark. Meliodas' first wife, Isabelle, who bore the hero Tristan, was Mark's sister, and his second wife was a daughter or sister of Hoel of Brittany. He is the eponymous protagonist of the romance Meliadus. The Italian variant Tristano Riccardiano calls him Felix (Felissi).  Meliodas  The French romance Meliadus is derived from the work originally entitled Palamedes, a series of tales based on the Tristan and Lancelot-Grail legends but going back to the heroes of the previous generation. Uther Pendragon, father of Arthur is still alive, and so are the fathers of Erec and Tristan. The title refers to the Saracen knight Palamedes, whose father Esclabor also plays a role. Certain manuscripts identify Palamedes as one of the central figures, but he seldom appears and Meliodas and his companion Guiron le Courtois are the most important characters.Loseth (1890). The Compilation of Rustichello da Pisa or Rusticien de Pise, is a later re-working of the legend focusing on Meliadus as the central character. Some versions, including the early 16th-century printed editions produced in Paris, are divided into two parts, with the first entitled Meliadus de Leonnoys and the second Gyron le Courtoys.For a detailed analysis of printed versions and their relationships to extant manuscripts, see Lathuillère 1966, pp. 159–64. The first part begins with the arrival of Esclabor, father of Palamedes at the court of the young Arthur, and later, of Pharamond, king of the Franks and the Chevalier sans peur. Meliodas only appears after a series of episodes involving these characters. He is, in turn, involved in various exploits which include carrying off the Queen of Scotland, being captured himself and then freed by Arthur, to aid him in his war against the Saxons. His son Tristan appears in the story as a child.Ward 1883 p. 368. Rustichello da Pisa's more complete version ends with the older knights being delivered from captivity and Meliodas acclaimed 'la flour de toute chevalerie' at Arthur's court.Bogdanow, pp. 46–47.  In modern culture Meliodas is depicted as the \\"Dragon's Sin of Wrath\\", as well as the leader of the Seven Deadly Sins, in both the anime and manga versions of Nakaba Suzuki's The Seven Deadly Sins. In the series, Meliodas is depicted as short, with blond hair and a very youthful appearance, despite being thousands of years old. He eventually has a child named Tristan at the end of the series.

The community was traditionally associated with the cultivation and management of cinnamon and were formerly also involved as weavers and soldiers.  Etymology  The Salagamas were also known as Saliya, also spelled Chaliya. The name is presumably derived from Chale of Kerala. History =Origins= The Salagamas trace their roots back to the Coromandel Coast and Malabar Coast of South India, and settled in the southern coastal areas of Sri Lanka. Their ancestors were a weaving community who were known as Saliya. Some Salagamas also have the vasagama or surname \\"Nambudirige\\" meaning \\"of the Nambudiri\\", which Prof. Gananath Obeyesekere deems as a spurious attempt by the caste to elevate their status to that of the Nambudiri Brahmins of Kerala (Due to caste competition with the Karava who claimed Kshatriya status). Like the other coastal castes such as the Karavas and Duravas, the Salagamas migrated to Sri Lanka between 13th to 18th century. =Colonial period= Under Portuguese rule, many Karavas and Salagamas converted to Catholicism, which opened way to education and administrative careers. The Portuguese continued the tradition of using Salagamas as cinnamon planters, who had to provide cinnamon as a tax. Queyroz mentions 'Chaleaz' as among the 'high castes' and that they prepared cinnamon for the 'great tax'.Queyroz, vol I, pp 19-20 When the Dutch East India Company (VOC) took over the coastal areas, it re-organised cinnamon cultivation on modern capitalist lines, with plantations located within the boundaries of VOC rule, mainly in the Galle district. The Salagamas were converted from a feudal caste into a modern proletariat.The Dutch demand for cinnamon was more intense than that of the Portuguese, and by the era of British control mortality rates among Salagamas had increased sharply. It became common practice for cinnamon peelers' children to be registered under the names of other castes in order to spare them a life of ever-growing misery. The census of 1824 identified the Salagamas as about 7.5% of the coastal Sinhalese population. However, they were concentrated in the Galle district, where about half of them lived and where they made up almost 20% of the population.Bryce Ryan, p 264  Sub- castes  Traditionally, the Salagama were divided into four sub-castes:Bryce Ryan, p 110 * Hewapanne ('warriors' & military officers/generals) * Panividakara ('Special messengers') or - headmen (equal to Mohottalas) * Kurundukara (Kurunthukarar in Tamil means ('cinnamon workers'). However, in modern times there is a simple twofold division between the Hewapanne and the Kurundukara. The former are of higher status, including landowners in their ranks, the \\"Kurundukara's\\" enjoyed a high status in Sinhala society, before being punished by the King of Kotte in 1406 and downgraded to a lower status, who also imposed cinnamon as a tax, at one stage the tax exceeded their manpower, and became virtually unbearable, and it took a heavy toll in their mortality rate, some of them were subsequently forced to change their names to other castes to escape it.  Occupations  Today, the Salagama predominance in cinnamon cultivation has declined, the higher status gained by the caste leading to its members abandoning their traditional occupation. Many Salagamas in the Hikkaduwa area became coral miners until the Boxing Day Tsunami of 2004 swept away their villages. The coral-lime kilns gave employment to many more. The Railway made access to employment in Colombo and other urban centres very much easier, and the caste became a very important part of the working class. Its higher echelons became notable in the engineering profession, mainly due to the influence of Sir Cyril de Zoysa, who owned the South Western Omnibus Company (see Ceylon Transport Board) and the Associated Motorways Group, and other businessmen in the motor trade.  Buddhist revival  By the mid 18th century, upasampada (higher ordination, as distinct from samanera or novice ordination) had become extinct in Sri Lanka. The Buddhist order had become extinct three times during the preceding five hundred years and was re- established in the reigns of Vimala Dharma Suriya I (1591–1604) and Vimala Dharma Suriya II (1687–1707) as well. These re-establishments were short lived. On the initiative of Ven. Weliwita Saranankara (1698–1778) the Thai monk Upali Thera visited Kandy during the reign of king Kirti Sri Rajasinghe (1747–1782) and once again reestablished the Buddhist order in Sri Lanka in 1753. It was called the Siyam Nikaya after the \\"Kingdom of Siam\\". It is said that in 1764, merely a decade after the re-establishment of the Buddhist order in Sri Lanka by reverend Upali, a group within the newly created Siyam Nikaya conspired and succeeded in restricting the Nikaya's higher ordination only to the Radala and Govigama caste, Sitinamaluwe Dhammajoti (Durawa) being the last nongovigama monk receive upasampada.Buddhism in Sinhalese Society, 1750-1900: A Study of Religious Revival and ... By Kitsiri Malalgoda, p. 91 This was a period when Buddhist Vinaya rules had been virtually abandoned and some members of the Buddhist Sangha in the Kandyan Kingdom privately held land, had wives and children, resided in the private homes and were called Ganinnanses. It was a period when the traditional nobility of the Kandyan Kingdom was decimated by continuous wars with the Dutch rulers of the Maritime Provinces. In the maritime provinces too a new order was replacing the old. Mandarampura Puvata, a text from the Kandyan peris, narrates the above radical changes to the monastic order and shows that it was not a unanimous decision by the body of the sangha. It says that thirty two ‘senior’ members of the Sangha who opposed this change were banished to Jaffna by the leaders of the reform. However, Queyroz mentions that in the 17th century no-one save appuhamies (gentlemen) and their relatives could be a monk, which suggests that elitism in the Buddhist order was of greater antiquity.Queyroz, vol I, p 114 The Govigama exclusivity of the Sangha was challenged by other castes who, without the patronage of the King of Kandy or of the British, held their own upasampada ceremony at Totagamuwa Vihara in 1772. Another was held at Tangalle in 1798. Neither of these ceremonies were approved by the Siam Nikaya which claimed that these were not  in accordance with the Vinaya rules. Hoping to rectify this situation, wealthy laymen from the maritime provinces financed an expedition to Burma to found a new monastic lineage. In 1799, Ambagahapitiye Gnanavimala Thera a monk from the Salagama caste, from Balapitiya on the south western coast of Sri Lanka, departed for Burma with a group of novices to seek a new succession of Higher ordination. The first bhikkhu was ordained in Burma in 1800 by the sangharaja of Burma in Amarapura, his party having been welcomed to Burma by King Bodawpaya. The initial mission returned to Sri Lanka in 1803. Soon after their return to the island they established a udakhupkhepa sima (a flotilla of boats moved together to form a platform on the water) on the Maduganga river, Balapitiya and, under the most senior Burmese monk who accompanied them, held an upasampada ceremony on Vesak Full Moon Day. The new fraternity came to be known as the Amarapura Nikaya and was soon granted recognition by the colonial British government. The Amarapura Nikaya was of pivotal importance in the revival of Buddhism in Sri Lanka in the 19th century. The Salagamas, who became overwhelmingly Buddhist, were in the vanguard of this movement. Modern radicalism The traditional Salagama areas around Balapitiya, Kosgoda, Ratgama, Hikkaduwa and Boossa were centres of the pan-Sinhalese populist movement of Anagarika Dharmapala(who was not from the Salagama community). The key issues around which this movement emerged were anti-casteism and anti-colonialism. The same areas were in the vanguard of the independence struggle and became hotbeds of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party and of the Communist Party. These areas were at the forefront of the Hartal of 1953.Colvin R de Silva, \\"Hartal!\\",  See also  * Caste system in Sri Lanka References * Bryce Ryan, Caste in Modern Ceylon, Rutgers University Press, 1953. * Fernăo de Queyroz (SG Perera, Tr), The Temporal and Spiritual Conquest of Ceylon, Colombo, Government Printer, 1930.

It is Michelangelo's only study drawn from a nude female model. It also may be the earliest extant European drawing of a nude female model. A figure study is a drawing or painting of the human body made in preparation for a more composed or finished work;Berry, Ch. 8 or to learn drawing and painting techniques in general and the human figure in particular. By preference, figure studies are done from a live model, but may also include the use of other references and the imagination of the artist. The live model may be clothed, or nude, but is usually nude for student work in order to learn human anatomy. A related term in sculpture is a maquette, a small scale model or rough draft of a proposed work. Drawings may also be preparatory for sculptural work. Preparatory studies may be compositional, representing the entire proposed work, or may only be of certain details, such as hands and feet. Studies may be sketches completed in a relatively short length of time, or very detailed depending upon the artist's preferred methods. Drawings may concentrate on shapes and form, while studies in painting media are about color and lighting. The term figure study is sometimes used in photography, but does not seem to be clearly defined as different from nude photography in general, given the inherently finished nature of the medium. Photography students may do work that is for educational purposes, and an artist may take photographs with the intent of using them as references for paintings, but the terms figure study or nude study is usually not limited to these preparatory or educational photos. This usage may have begun in the 19th century, when some photographers called their nude images “studies for artists” merely to evade the censors. Education Beginning in the Renaissance drawing the figure from life has been considered the best way to learn how to draw, and the practice has been maintained into the present. Different drawing techniques and exercises have become standard, including gesture, contour, and mass drawings. For beginners first learning to draw, learning to correctly observe real objects is essential in order to learn three dimensional perspective and the effects of lighting. Live models are preferred but if not available, plaster casts of the figure may be used, never photographs.Nicolaides =Open drawing groups= Experienced artists continue to practice drawing the figure long after their formal education is completed by attending informal groups with no instruction that meet, often weekly, to share the cost of hiring a model. Known by various names, such as sketch groups, figure sessions, etc.; the format is similar to beginning or intermediate drawing classes, being three hours in total that start with a number of gestures and proceed to slightly longer poses, but rarely more than 20 minutes each, only time enough for studies. Such open drawing groups can be found in many locals in the United States, and in other countries that share the Western tradition of figure studies.Steinhart Brooklyn Museum - Figure Study of Musculature - Daniel Huntington Preparatory During the 16th to the 19th centuries, painters did numerous drawings and color studies in preparation for large works that might take a year or more to complete. Since the late 19th century studies have become less important as painters adopted of the wet-on-wet, or alla prima painting technique, in which layers of wet paint are applied to previous layers of wet paint, the sketch being merely the first layer. However, the use of studies has been maintained by the academic art tradition.

This concept was born in 1992 during the Earth Summit of Rio de Janeiro. The specifics regarding ICZM is set out in the proceedings of the summit within Agenda 21, Chapter 17. European Commission defines the ICZM as \\"a dynamic, multidisciplinary and iterative process to promote sustainable management of coastal zones. It covers the full cycle of information collection, planning (in its broadest sense), decision making, management and monitoring of implementation. ICZM uses the informed participation and cooperation of all stakeholders to assess the societal goals in a given coastal area, and to take actions towards meeting these objectives. ICZM seeks, over the long-term, to balance environmental, economic, social, cultural and recreational objectives, all within the limits set by natural dynamics. 'Integrated' in ICZM refers to the integration of objectives and also to the integration of the many instruments needed to meet these objectives. It means integration of all relevant policy areas, sectors, and levels of administration. It means integration of the terrestrial and marine components of the target territory, in both time and space.\\" ICZM Framework ICZM provides a global common thought process and decision making framework which is flexible enough to find solutions tailored to the diverse range of world's as well as unique national, regional and local coastline and coastal environments and needs. ICZM management must embrace a holistic viewpoint of the functions that makeup the complex and dynamic nature of interactions in the coastal environment.WILLIAMS, A. & MICALLEF, A. 2009. Beach Management: Principles and Practice, London, Earthscan Publications Limited. Management framework must be applied to a defined geographical limit (often complicated) and should operate with a high level of integration. =Importance of ICZM =  Significance and management of Coastal Zone  The Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) is a key element for the sustainable development of these zones. However this recent notion may not be adapted to all cases.Billé, R. (2008) “Integrated Coastal Zone Management: four entrenched illusions”. S.A.P.I.EN.S. 1 (2) The natural disasters Sumatra earthquake and the Indian Ocean tsunami have made a lot of impact on the coastal environment and also the stakeholder's perception on mitigation and management of coastal hazards.Kurt Fedra. 2008. Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM). Singapore: Research Publishing Services. The dynamic processes that occur within the coastal zones produce diverse and productive ecosystems which have been of great importance historically for human populations.KAY, R. & ALDER, J. 1999. Coastal Planning and Management, London, E & FN Spon. Coastal margins equate to only 8% of the worlds surface area but provide 25% of global productivity. Stress on this environment comes with approximately 70% of the world's population being within a day's walk of the coast.BROWN, K., TOMPKINS, E. L. & ADGER, N. 2002. Making Waves: Integrating coastal conservation and development, London, Earthscan Publications Limited. Two-thirds of the world's cities occur on the coast.CROOKS, S. & TURNER, R. K. 1999. Integrated coastal management: sustaining estuarine natural resources. Advances in Ecological Research, 29, 241-289. Valuable resources such as fish and minerals are considered to be common property and are in high demand for coastal dwellers for subsistence use, recreation and economic development.BERKES, F. 1989. Common property resources: Ecology and community- based sustainable development, London. Through the perception of common property, these resources have been subjected to intensive and specific exploitation. For example; 90% of the world's fish harvest comes from within national exclusive economic zones, most of which are within the sight of shore. This type of practice has led to a problem that has cumulative effects. The addition of other activities adds to the strain placed on this environment. As a whole, human activity in the coastal zone generally degrades the systems by taking unsustainable quantities of resources. The effects are further exacerbated with the input of pollutant wastes. This provides the need for management. Due to the complex nature of human activity in this zone a holistic approach is required to obtain a sustainable outcome. Goals of ICZM For ICZM to be successful it must adhere to the principles that define sustainability and act upon them in ways that are integrated. An optimal balance between environmental protection and the development of economic and social sectors is paramount.CICIN-SAIN, B. & KNECHT, R. 1998. Integrated coastal and ocean management: concepts and practices. Washington D.C.: Island Press. As part of the holistic approach ICZM applies, many aspects within a coastal zone are expected to be considered and accounted for. These include but are not limited to: the spatial, functional, legal, policy, knowledge, and participation dimensions.IDRUS, M. R. 2009. Hard Habits to Break: Investigating Coastal Resource Utilisations and Management Systems in Sulawesi, Indonesia Doctor of Philosophy in Environmental Science, University of Canterbury. Below are four identified goals of ICZM: * Maintaining the functional integrity of the coastal resource systems; * Reducing resource-use conflicts; * Maintaining the health of the environment; * Facilitating the progress of multisectoral developmentTHIA-ENG, C. 1993. Essential Elements of Integrated Coastal Zone Management. Ocean and Coastal Management, 21, 81-108. Failure to include these aspects and goals would lead to a form of unsustainable management, undermining the paradigms explicit to ICZM. =ICZM 5-step process = # Problem and needs assessment: Issues and problems need to be identified and assessments of these need to be quantified. This first step will include integration between government, sectoral entities and local residents. The assessments also have to be broad in their application. # Plan: After the issues and problems have been identified and weighted, an effective management plan can be made. The plan will be specific to the area in question. #Institutionalization of plan: The adoption of the plan is carried out, which could be in the form of legally binding statutory plans, strategies or objectives which are generally quite powerful or they can be non-statutory processes and can act as a guide for future development. This duality is largely beneficial as the future can be taken into account, but still provide for a firm stance based in the present. # Implementation: Operationalization of the plan through law enforcement, education, development, etc. The implementation activities are unique to their environments and can take many forms. # Evaluation: The last phase is evaluation of the whole process. The principles of sustainability mean that there is no ‘end state.’ ICZM is an ongoing process which should constantly readjust the equilibrium between economic development and the protection of the environment. Feedback is a crucial part of the process and allows for continued effectiveness even when a situation may change. Public participation and stakeholder involvement is essential in ICZM processes, not only in terms of a democratic approach, but also from a technical–instrumental point of view, in order to reduce decisional conflicts (Ioppolo et al., 2013)..Ioppolo G.,Saija G.,Salomone R. 2013. From coastal management to environmental management: The sustainable eco-tourism program for the mid-western coast of Sardinia (Italy). Land Use Policy (31), 460-471. =Dimensions of Coastal Zone management = Defining Coastal Zones Defining the Coastal zone is of particular importance to the idea of ICZM. But the fuzziness of borders due to the dynamic nature of the coast makes it difficult to clearly define. Most simply the coast can be thought of as an area of interaction between the land and the ocean. Ketchum (1972)KETCHUM, B. H. 1972. The water's edge: critical problems of the coastal zone. In: Coastal Zone Workshop, 22 May-3 June 1972 Woods Hole, Massachusetts. Cambridge: MIT Press. defined the area as: > The band of dry land and adjacent ocean space (water and submerged land) in > which terrestrial processes and land uses directly affect oceanic processes > and uses, and vice versa. Issues arise with the diversity of features present on the coast and the spatial scales of the interacting systems. Coasts being dynamic in nature are influenced differently all around the world. Influences such as river systems, may reach far inland increasing the complexity and scale of the zone. These issues make it difficult to clearly identify hinterlands and subscribe any subsequent management. Whilst acknowledging a physical coastal zone, the inclusion of ecosystems, resources and human activity within the zone is important. It is the human activities that warrant management. These activities are responsible for disrupting the natural coastal systems. To add to the complexity of this zone, administrative boundaries use arbitrary lines that dissect the zone, often leading to fragmented management. This sectored approach focuses on specific activities such as land use and fisheries, often leading to adverse effects in another sector.  Finding sustainable solutions  The concept behind the idea of ICZM is sustainability. For ICZM to succeed, it must be sustainable. Sustainability entails a continuous process of decision making, so there is never an end-state just a readjustment of the equilibrium between development and the protection of the environment.CICIN-SAIN, B. 1993. Sustainable Development and Integrated Coastal Management. Ocean and Coastal Management, 21, 11-43. The concept of Sustainability or sustainable development came to fruition in the 1987 report of the World Commission on Environment and Development, Our Common Future. It stated sustainable development is “to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs”.WORLD, COMMISSION, ON, ENVIRONMENT, AND & DEVELOPMENT 1987. Towards Sustainable future, \\"Our common future\\". New York: Oxford University Press. Highlighted are three main standpoints which summarise the idea of Sustainable development, they are: * Economic development to improve the quality of life of people * Environmentally appropriate development * Equitable development To simplify these points, sustainability should acknowledge the right of humans to live a life that is healthy and productive. It should allow for equal distribution of benefits to all people and in doing so protect the environment through appropriate use. Sustainability is by no means a set of prescriptive actions, more accurately it is a way of thinking. Adapting this way of thinking paves the way for a longer-term view with a more holistic approach, something successful ICZM can achieve.MASSELINK, G. & HUGHES, M. 2003. Introduction to Coastal Processes and Geomorphology, London, Hodder Arnold.  Finding integration and synergies  The term ‘integration’ can be adopted for many different purposes, it is therefore quite important to define the term in the context of the management of the coastal zone to appreciate the intentions of ICZM. Integration within ICZM occurs in and between many different levels, 5 types of integration that occur within ICZM, are explained below; Integration among sectors: Within the coastal environment there are many sectors that operate. These human activities are largely economic activities such as tourism, fisheries, and port companies. A sense of co- operation between sectors is the main requirement for sector integration within ICZM. This comes from the realisation of a common goal focused around sustainability and the appreciation of one another within the area. Integration between land and water elements of the coastal zone: This is the realisation of the physical environment being a whole. The coastal environment is a dynamic relationship between many processes all of which are interdependent. The link must be made between imposing a change on one system or feature and its inevitable ‘flow on’ effects. Integration among levels of government: Between levels of governance, consistency and co-operation is needed throughout planning and policy making. ICZM is most effective where initiatives have common purpose at local, regional, and national levels. Common goals and actions increase efficiency and mitigate confusion. Integration between nations: This sees ICZM as an important tool on a global scale. If goals and beliefs are common on a supranational scale, large scale problems could be mitigated or avoided. Integration among disciplines: Throughout ICZM, knowledge should be accepted from all disciplines. All means of scientific, cultural, traditional, political and local expertise need to be accounted for. By including all these elements a truly holistic approach towards management can be achieved. The term integration in a coastal management context has many horizontal and vertical aspects, which reflects the complexity of the task and it proves a challenge to implement. = Constraints of ICZM= Successful implementation is still a major challenge to the idea of ICZM .  Top-down and bottom-up approach  Major constraints of ICZM are mostly institutional, rather than technological. The ‘top-down’ approach of administrative decision making sees problematisation as a tool promoting ICZM through the idea of sustainability. Community-based ‘bottom-up’ approaches can perceive problems and issues that are specific to a local area. The benefit of this is that the problems are real and acknowledged rather than searched for to fit an imposed strategy or policy. Public consultation and involvement is very important for current ‘top-down’ approaches, as it can incorporate this ‘bottom-up’ idea into the policies made. Prescriptive ‘top- down’ methods have not able to effectively address problems of resource utilization in poor coastal communities as perceptions of the coastal zone differ with regard to developed and developing countries. This leads on to another constraint to ICZM, the idea of common property.  Human factors  The coastal environment has huge historical and cultural connections with human activity. Its wealth of resources have provided for millennia, with regard to ICZM how does management become legally binding if the dominant perception of the coast is of a common area available to all? And should it? Enforcing restrictions or change to activities within the coastal zone can be difficult as these resources are often very important to people's livelihoods. The idea of the coast being common property fouls ‘top-down’ approaches. The idea of common property itself is not all that clean, This perception can lead to cumulative exploitation of resources – the very problem this management seeks to extinguish. Adoption of ICZM =European Union = The European Parliament and the European Council \\"adopted in 2002 a Recommendation on Integrated Coastal Zone Management which defines the principles sound coastal planning and management. These include the need to base planning on sound and shared knowledge, the need to take a long-term and cross-sector perspective, to pro-actively involve stakeholders and the need to take into account both the terrestrial and the marine components of the coastal zone\\".http://ec.europa.eu/environment/iczm/home.htm =Iran= Preparation of comprehensive management plans for optimum utilization of existent sources and potentials in all developed and developing countries is one of the appropriate approaches for constant and permanent utilization of natural, human and financial sources. The versatility of natural sources in coastal areas has made private and governmental users and investors to participate in this section to gain the utmost profits. Therefore, the necessity of preparation and implementation of management plans for perpetual utilization of existent sources in coastal areas has become inevitable. Iran, possessing some 6000 km of coastline in north and south, owns abundant economic capacities in coastal zones and regarding the versatility of nature and coast operators and management of coastal activities and operations, necessity of attention to Integrated Coastal Zone Management becomes more significant. Such necessity has gained its legal support through ratification of arrangements no. 40 from transportation chapter of third and article no. 63 of fourth economic, social and cultural economic schedule and its executive regulations. The General Director of coasts and ports engineering of Ports and Maritime Organization was detailed to take the studies of ICZM into consideration. The first phase of these studies began in spring 2003 and was fulfilled in autumn 2006. The outcome of this phase was compilation of following reports accomplished by several national and international skilled consultants: 1- Project Methodology 2- Scrutinized scope of services related to studies 3- Investigation of studies' needs and project preparation and performance 4- Study, definition and determination of Iranian coastal zones boundaries 6- Investigation of International concepts, methods and experiences about Integrated Coastal Zone Management 7- Study and investigation of different features of Integrated Coastal Zone Management in Iran 8- Preparation and designation of geographic database 9- Purchasing and preparing basic data The second phase of studies started up in autumn 2005 and since then this phase has been fully accomplished and presented, In which six competent Iranian consultants with some cooperation of international consultants are responsible for preparing the eleven results of second part of the studies.Portal of the Iran ICZM = Mediterranean= At the Conference of the Plenipotentiaries on the ICZM Protocol that took place on 20–21 January 2008 in Madrid, the ICZM Protocol was signed. Under the presidency of the Minister of Environment of Spain, H.E. Ms. Cristina Narbona Ruiz, fourteen Contracting Parties of the Barcelona Convention signed the Protocol. These are the following: Algeria, Croatia, France, Greece, Israel, Italy, Malta, Monaco, Montenegro, Morocco, Slovenia, Spain, Syria and Tunisia. All other Parties announced to do so in the very near future. This is the 7th Protocol in the framework of the Barcelona Convention, and the decision to approve the draft text and recommendation to the Conference of the Plenipotentiaries to sign it was taken at the 15th Ordinary Meeting of the Contracting Parties during their meeting in Almeria, on 15–18 January 2008. All the parties are convinced that this Protocol is a crucial milestone in the history of the Mediterranean Action Plan of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP/MAP), the first-ever Regional Seas Programme under UNEP's umbrella. It will allow the countries to better manage their coastal zones, as well as to deal with the emerging coastal environmental challenges, such as the climate change. The ICZM Protocol is a unique legal instrument in the entire international community and the Mediterranean countries are proud of this fact. They are willing to share these experiences with other coastal countries of the world. The signing of the Protocol came after six years of dedicated work of all the Parties. Syria entered history for being the sixth, and \\"enter-into-force\\", country for the ICZM Protocol! Namely, the President of the Syrian Arab Republic issued a Legislative Decree No. 85 dated 31 September 2010 for the ratification of the ICZM Protocol. With this 6th ratification, the ICZM Protocol entered into force one month later provided that Syria deposits the instrument of ratification to the depositary country, i.e. Spain. In September 2012, Croatia and Morocco ratified the Protocol, which brought the number of ratifications to 9 (Slovenia, Montenegro, Albania, Spain, France, European Union, Syria, Croatia, Morocco). The Action Plan for the implementation of the ICZM Protocol 2012-2019 was adopted on the occasion of the CoP 17, held in Paris from 8 to 10 February 2012. The core purposes and objectives of this Action Plan are to implement the Protocol based on country-based planning and regional co- ordination, namely: 1\\\\. Support the effective implementation of the ICZM Protocol at regional, national and local levels including through a Common Regional Framework for ICZM; 2\\\\. Strengthen the capacities of Contracting Parties to implement the Protocol and use in an effective manner ICZM policies, instruments, tools and processes; and 3\\\\. Promote the ICZM Protocol and its implementation within the region, and promote it globally by developing synergies with relevant Conventions and Agreements. A road-map for the implementation of the ICZM Process, prepared by Priority Actions Programme Regional Activity Centre (PAP/RAC), is available on the Coastal Wiki platform of the PEGASO and ENCORA projects: ICZM Process. On May 8, 2014 the Israeli Government ratified the ICZM Protocol. This Resolution (#1588) was made in accordance with Article 19(b) of the Government Rules of Procedure. The ICZM Protocol ratification by Israel brings the number of ratifications to 10. It has become tradition in the Mediterranean to celebrate the Coast Day after it had first been organised in 2007. The main purpose of the Mediterranean Coast Day is to raise awareness of the importance of the coast as both natural and economic resource, as well as to warn of the risks to which it is exposed due to natural phenomena and human actions. September 25 was chosen as the Mediterranean Coast Day to honour the date when Slovenia ratified the ICZM Protocol as the first Mediterranean country to do so. Each year the central Mediterranean celebration is organised in a different country, while other countries organise their own events. Thus, in 2007 and 2008 the central celebration was organised in Sardinia, Italy. In 2009 the host to the central celebration was Turkey, in 2010 Slovenia, in 2011 Algeria, in 2012 Croatia, in 2013 Italy and in 2014 Tunisia. In 2014, a short animated movie “A good climate for change” was produced by PAP/RAC (in co-operation with BONOBO Studio Zagreb, Croatia) for the 2014 Mediterranean Coast Day. The movie was officially launched on the occasion of the central regional celebration of the Mediterranean Coast Day in Tunisia which was organised in the frame of the MedPartnership project. =New Zealand= New Zealand is quite unique as it uses sustainable management within legislation, with a high level of importance placed on to the coastal environment. The Resource Management Act (RMA) (1991) promoted sustainable development and mandated the preparation of a New Zealand Coastal Policy Statement (NZCPS), a national framework for coastal planning. It is the only national policy statement that was mandatory.PEART, R. 2007. Beyond the Tide: Integrating the management of New Zealand's coasts, Auckland, Environmental Defence Society All subsequent planning must not be inconsistent with the NZCPS, making it a very important document. Regional authorities are required to produce Regional coastal policy plans under the RMA (1991) but strangely enough, they only need to include the marine environment seaward of the mean high water mark. But many regional councils have chosen to integrate the ‘dry’ landward area within their plans, breaking down the artificial barriers. This attempt at ICZM is still in its early days running into many legislative hurdles and is yet to achieve a fully ecosystems-based approach. But as part of ICZM, evaluation and adoption of changes is important and ongoing changes to the NZCPS in the form of reviews is currently happening. This will provide an excellent stepping stone for future initiatives and the development of a fully integrated form of coastal management.

Currently he is an associate professor at the Department of Linguistics at the University of Sydney. He has worked in the fields of language policy development, pidgin and creole languages, NNEST studies, English language acquisition, English language teaching and teacher education, World Englishes, pragmatics, and minority languages in South Asia. Ahmar earned his PhD from Indiana University Bloomington in 2003, and has published extensively. He was the co-editor of TESOL Quarterly, alongside Brian Paltridge, for several years. He was also the Associate Editor of Linguistics and the Human Sciences and serves on the editorial boards of a number of journals. Ahmar has organised a number of regional, national, and international conferences and is the convenor and the co-creator of the Free Linguistics Conference.  Introduction  Mahboob was born in 1971 in Karachi, Pakistan He first studied English literature at the University of Karachi, and later earned a PhD at Indiana University Bloomington in 2003. His dissertation was entitled Status of non-native English speakers as ESL teachers in the United States. Ahmar has worked in language policy development, pidgin and creole languages, NNEST studies, English language acquisition, English language teaching and teacher education, World Englishes, pragmatics, and issues surrounding minority languages in South Asia. His recent work has focused on Pakistani English and on the various languages of Pakistan. Ahmar is the past president of the Indiana chapter of TESOL International and the Past Chair of the NNEST Caucus of TESOL International. Ahmar also convened of the 2011 TESOL Convention in New Orleans. Ahmar and Josephine Chen are the co-founders of the FLC Group, a linguistics organization. Ahmar has made a significant contribution to the Non-native English Speakers in TESOL (NNEST) movement. In reference to Ahmar's work, George Braine, a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, writes that \\"Over the years, Ahmar Mahboob has made a lasting contribution to the nonnative speaker movement. His doctoral dissertation titled 'Status of nonnative English-speaking teachers in the United States' was one of the first to explore the nonnative speaker issue in English language teaching, and he later became an energetic Chair of the Nonnative Speaker Caucus within the TESOL organization.\\" In addition to his PhD research, Ahmar's book, The NNEST Lens, received critical acclaim. In his own words, \\"The NNEST lens is a lens of multilingualism, multinationalism, and multiculturalism through which NNESTs and NESTs – as classroom practitioners, researchers, and teacher educators – take diversity as a starting point in their understanding and practice of their profession.\\" In addition to his work with NNESTs, Ahmar has also been working on issues of race and religion in the community of teachers teaching English to speakers of other languages (TESOL). Among other things, Ahmar introduced the notion of \\"enracement\\". For Ahmar, the verb enrace means acquiring one's awareness of race. He writes that \\"[t]he verb enrace does not only mean that we are enraced by others – that others cause us to construct our racial identity – but, also that we enrace others – that our actions, behaviors, and/or discourses lead to a (re)negotiation of other people's racial awareness. This process of enracement is a result of our negotiations and interactions with people (both of our own race and other races) and is partly grounded in how other people view, experience, and/or stereotype our race and how we view, experience, and/or stereotype them.\\" Ahmar's recent research has focused on issues of applicability of linguistics. In his co- edited volume, Appliable Linguistics: Texts, Contexts, and Meanings, he introduces Appliable Linguistics as an approach to language that takes everyday real-life language related problems – both theoretical and practical – in diverse social, professional and academic contexts as a starting point and then develops and contributes to a theoretical model of language that can respond to and is appliable in the context. This approach focuses on the importance of theory and practice being interrelated in linguistics. He draws on work by M. A. K. Halliday as well as J R Martin in developing this framework. Ahmar has also made considerable contributions to the study of World Englishes, and in particular Pakistani English. His work on Pakistani English includes studies of the phonetics, phonology, lexis, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and discourse structure of the language. His more recent work on World Englishes focuses on World Englishes and identity, for example, English as an Islamic language. More recently, Ahmar has been focusing on the relationship between World Englishes and higher education. He is specifically interested in understanding 'use' based variations in World Englishes. He argues that the relationship between the language of everyday use and that of academic discourses should not be confused in the context of education, and that it is the language of academic discourses that need to be prioritized in educational contexts. An emphasis on everyday language, he argues, can lead to ghettoisation of the students rather than the growth of their knowledge them. In attempting to develop this work, he developed a model of language variation that can be used to situate the current work in World Englishes and English as a lingua franca, as well as open up space to explore how these processes of language variation and convergence need to consider specialized discourses in addition to everyday language. One more area of interest for Ahmar has been 'identity management', which he defines as any effort made at an institutionalized (macro) or individualized (micro) level to shape, direct, or influence the identities of others. His work in this area predominantly focuses on educational discourses and he demonstrates how English language curricula use language to promote 'normalized' identities that are promoted by the authorities to maintain the status quo in their respective societies and thus maintain socio-economic disparities within the society. Ahmar currently coordinates the MA program in Applied Linguistics at the University of Sydney. In addition to academic work, Ahmar also writes poems and fiction.

The Commonwealth forces won the battle, annihilating enemy forces and taking Radziwiłł captive.  Background  In the late summer of 1656 Swedish and Brandenburgian armies left Warsaw, retreating towards the northwest. Polish-Lithuanian commanders then decided to invade the Duchy of Prussia, which had been a vassal state to the Kingdom of Poland and which, as Brandenburg-Prussia, had been an ally of the Swedish Empire (see Treaty of Königsberg (1656). The objective of the invasion was to make “The Great Elector”, Frederick Wilhelm, end the alliance with Sweden. Polish-Lithuanian forces were commanded by Lithuanian Field Hetman Wincenty Korwin Gosiewski. They were supported by a unit of Crimean Tatars, under Subchan Ghazi Aga. All together Gosiewski’s army had some 8,000-10,000 men (including 2,000 Tatars). In early October 1656 it crossed the Narew River, either near Łomża or Wizna, and headed northwards to Lyck (Ełk). Prussian commandant Prince Georg Friedrich of Waldeck concentrated his forces near Wąsosz. His army had probably 3,500 men, mostly reiters and dragoons. Waldeck reached Prostken (Prostki) on October 6 and camped on the eastern bank of the Ełk River, near a bridge that he planned to defend. He also got in touch with Bogusław Radziwilł, whose cavalry unit of 800 was stationed in Rajgród. Furthermore, additional Prussian units were stationed at some distance from Lyck. Upon hearing of the invasion, they set off to help Waldeck, but only some 1,000 men reached Prostken before the battle. A unit of 2,000 men and 12 cannons left Lyck on October 8, which was too late.  The battle  On the morning of October 8 first Tatar and then Lithuanian units reached the village, while main forces were some two hours behind them. Gosiewski, who enjoyed numerical superiority over the enemy, decided to make the Prussians abandon their positions behind the river and destroy them in an open field. At the same time he sent Tatars towards Lyck to face the Prussian reinforcements. In the first stage of the battle the Lithuanians pretended to retreat, after an initial clash. This worked, as the Prussians crossed the river, while Waldeck, upon receiving news of Tatars, sent a cavalry unit of 500 towards Lyck. This unit was reinforced by the cavalry of Bogusław Radziwiłł, which soon afterwards clashed with the Tatars. When the main Lithuanian force attacked the Prussians, Waldeck ordered his troops to return behind the river. Gosiewski attacked the Prussians, forcing them to retreat. Meanwhile, the Tatars crossed the Elk and attacked the camp. Soon afterwards they were joined by the Lithuanians. The unit of Bogusław Radziwiłł was completely destroyed, while Radziwiłł himself was captured. Prince Waldeck, with 500 soldiers, managed to escape, as the Tatars and the Lithuanians were too busy looting the Prussian camp. All together, the battle lasted approximately five hours.  Aftermath  After the victory Gosiewski sent a letter to Frederick Wilhelm, urging him to abandon the Swedes. The Great Elector rejected this, which resulted in widespread looting and destruction of the southeastern corner of the Duchy of Prussia, together with the neighboring Polish counties of Wizna and Rajgród. Gosiewski then marched with his army to Lithuania, while the Tatars returned to Crimea.

His 1870 autobiography The Adventures of Martin Cash, ghostwritten by James Lester Burke, a former convict, became a best seller in Australia.  Biography  Born in Enniscorthy, County Wexford, Ireland, Cash was brought up in a wealthy family and was literate. When 18 years of age he became acquainted with a young woman of Enniscorthy, who earned a living by making straw hats and bonnets. She and her family borrowed money from him, until his mother stopped him for his extravagance, which was rapidly draining her resources. Subsequently, he became involved in an occurrence which changed the whole course of his life. His memoirs describe that, in a jealous rage, he shot at a man named Jessop for making advances to his sweetheart. Cash was sentenced to seven years penal transportation, and he left Cork Harbour on board the Marquis of Huntly with 170 other convicts. They arrived in Sydney Town on 10 February 1828. =In New South Wales= Cash was \\"assigned\\" to Mr G. Bowman of Richmond, who leased other farms on the Hunter River, where Martin was transferred, and where he became a stockrider for nine years. John Boodle, who had a station on Liverpool Plains, asked Cash to assist him and his brother to brand some cattle which, unknown to Cash, had been stolen. While the branding was in progress two strangers came along, remained a few minutes, and departed. Upon Boodle informing him that the strangers knew the cattle were stolen, and that transportation to Norfolk Island was the penalty for this crime, Cash decided to leave for Van Diemen's Land. He sailed in the barque Francis Freeling for Hobart Town, and arrived on 10 February 1837. =In Tasmania= Martin Cash, The Bushranger of Van Diemen's Land in 1843In Van Diemen's Land, Cash eventually came before John Giles Price, a magistrate at Hobart Town, who sentenced him to two years in addition to his original seven years' sentence, and to four years' imprisonment with hard labour at Port Arthur. He briefly escaped and 18 months was added to his time. Again he escaped, and almost made it across the Bass Strait with his partner Bessie, but was caught and faced ten years at Port Arthur, the so-called escape proof colony. His first attempt at escape from Port Arthur failed. However, he managed to swim across the purportedly shark-infested Eaglehawk Neck, the first person to do so. This experience would later prove useful as it earned him much respect from other prisoners. On Boxing Day 1842 Cash, George Jones and Lawrence Kavenagh absconded from a work party. Hiding in dense scrub land and with little food they made their way to the neck. Swimming with their clothes tied in bundles above their heads, they made the other side, all three of them having lost their bundles. Now naked the trio robbed a road gang's hut for clothing, and began a twenty-month spree of bushranging, robbing mail coaches, homesteads and inns. The three became known as Cash and Co and their reputation grew, however in August 1843 Cash discovered his partner Bessie was with another man in Hobart. Enraged, Cash swore to kill them both and he made his way to Hobart. On 29 August 1843 he was quickly spotted in Brisbane Street, Hobart, near the old Commodore Inn and a gunfight ensued. Constable Peter Winstanley was shot by Cash and died two days later. Cash was trialled for murder in September 1843. Cash was found guilty and sentenced to death by hanging, but a last minute reprieve saw him sentenced to transportation for life at Norfolk Island. Portrait of bush-ranger Martin Cash, 1823-1843, by Thomas Bock, from original pencil sketch, PXE 5, f.3 =In Norfolk Island= There he eventually became a trustee, and later a constable. He married in 1854, and was granted his ticket of leave later that year. Between 1854 and 1856, he was an overseer in the Royal Hobart Botanical Gardens. They had one child, a son, Martin born in 1855. Subsequently, he travelled to Christchurch, New Zealand, where he kept several brothels, in 1860 and became a free man in 1863. =Return to Tasmania= Cash died in his bed in Amiens Avenue Glenorchy in 1877. He is one of the few bushrangers to die of old age. During the late 1860s he had dictated his autobiography to an amanuensis, James Lester Burke. This account, although often embellished, provides an insight into convict life. Buck and Joan Emberg later transcribed this account from the original manuscript and released it as The Uncensored Story of Martin Cash.

Supervised by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, the program is administered by the Prudential Insurance Company of America.SGLI 2009 Annual Report/pdf It is available to active-duty members of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, Coast Guard, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Corps, and the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps. Ready reservists, cadets, and midshipmen at the four service academies (but not the Merchant Marine Academy), and members of the Reserve Officer Training Corps are also all eligible. Insurance is available in increments of $50,000, up to a maximum of $400,000. As of July 1, 2014, SGLI premiums are $0.07 per month per $1,000 of insurance, regardless of the member's age. An additional $1 per month is charged for traumatic injury protection (TSGLI). Accordingly, a $400,000 policy costs $29 per month. Notably, the SGLI does not have a war clause exclusion which otherwise precludes benefits if death results from combat. Veterans' Group Life Insurance (VGLI) is a similar product available to veterans. SGLI policyholders may convert their policy to VGLI upon discharge unless an exception for total disability applies. Premiums for VGLI are higher and are based on the age of the insured. US military life insurance lawsuit In 2010, various media outlets noted allegations that the Prudential Life Insurance Company was manipulating the payout of life insurance benefits due to the families of American service members to gain extra profits. The company provided life insurance to people in the armed forces under a government contract. Rather than paying the full amount due to the families at once, the company would instead deposit the funds into a Prudential corporate account. These accounts are referred to as 'retained asset accounts' and are essentially an I.O.U. from the company to the payee (in many cases a fallen service members' family). While in early 2010 Prudential was making profits of up to 4.2% in its general account, they paid out 0.5% interest in these non- FDIC insured \\"Alliance\\" accounts. In some cases, when families requested to be sent a full payout in the form of a check, the family was sent a checkbook, rather than the amount due. It is not clear if the practice violated the law or the contract. In August 2010, the company was sued by some bereaved families. The company's response included an open letter to the military community in which it addressed what it characterized as \\"misinformation\\" about the nature of the accounts. Military Times noted that prior lawsuits against insurance companies pertaining to the use of retained asset accounts have been dismissed in federal courts without action. Alternatives Insurance coverage similar to SGLI is replicated by a few other private organizations. These include the Military Benefit Association (MBA), the United Services Automobile Association (USAA), the Army and Air Force Mutual Aid Association (AAFMAA), the Uniformed Services Benefit Association (USBA), the Armed Services Mutual Benefit Association (ASMBA), and the Navy Mutual Aid Association (NMAA). These organizations provide insurance for members of the armed forces, sometimes with similar or higher coverage levels at rates that are similar to or lower than SGLI. Like SGLI, the coverage provided is unique in that it is tailored to the needs of military members, and do not have war clause exclusions.

Established about 1670, it is the town's oldest cemetery, and the burial site for many of the city's civic and industrial leaders. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. Description and history The Center Street Cemetery is located in Wallingford's town center, occupying most of a block bounded by South Colony Road, Center Street, South Orchard Street, and Prince Street. It is about in size, its terrain basically level. Its main entrance is near the western end of its Center Street frontage, demarcated by an Egyptian Revival gateway. A secondary entrance is located on Orchard Street, and the internal circulation is defined in part by a series of allées lined by mature sycamore trees, with gravel and grass paths in between. Graves are generally organized in open settings -- there are no fenced burial plots. Layout of the burials varies depending on the practices of the period: early graves, mainly in the western third, were placed without noticeable planning, while the eastern two-thirds are organized into a grid pattern. Funerary markers consist of a cross-section of materials and styles, spanning more than three centuries of history. Lyman Hall, a native of Connecticut who moved to Georgia and was a signer of the Declaration of Independence in 1776, is memorialized here, as is Moses Yale Beach, newspaper publisher and founder of the Associated Press. The tomb, set on the north end of the 300-year-old Center Street Cemetery, lies near the graves of such other notaries as Thomas Yale, brother of the founder of Yale University; and Joseph Benham, whose daughter and granddaughter were the last people in New England to be tried for witchcraft.Entertaining the Devil in Connecticut.

These molecular biology cores are now commonplace and necessary in that they provide NIH funded academic labs access to expensive instrumentation in a shared use setting. The Molecular Biology Core Facilities (MBCF) was created to allow investigators at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) access to cutting edge molecular biology tools which would be tested and developed in a shared setting. Collaborations can be set up with anyone in the world. Although these services are primarily focused on Cancer and AIDS research, there is a broad spectrum of research that uses these resources. The MBCF logo.  History  The MBCF at DFCI was first started in 1984 to supply small oligonucleotides to researchers. Marvin H. Caruthers at the University of Colorado determined how to synthesize small oligonucleotides by solid-phase synthesis using the phosphoramidite method.Beaucage SL, Caruthers MH. (1981) Tetrahedron Lett. 22, 1859-62.McBride LJ, Caruthers MH. (1983) Tetrahedron Lett. 24, 245-8. Caruthers and Leroy Hood at the California Institute of Technology constructed the first automated DNA Synthesizer which the MBCF successfully tested after discussions with Don Taylor. Because of the growing demand for oligonucleotide primers to initiate DNA replication and for probes, a plan was put into place to develop a core facility to produce reagents for molecular biologists as well as instrumentation for the analysis of DNA and protein samples. This plan stated that a charge-back method would be put in place to fairly spread the resources as a shared facility. A Peptide Synthesizer using Bruce Merrifield's solid phase peptide synthesis was brought online in 1988 when Fmoc chemistry became commercially available. A Protein Sequencer using Edman degradationEdman, P. Acta Chem. Scand. 1950, 4, 283. was installed in 1989 quickly followed by several DNA Sequencers which were the first to use fluorescent dye terminator chemistry.Nature. 1986 Jun 12-18;321(6071):674-9. Fluorescence detection in automated DNA sequence analysis. We have developed a method for the partial automation of DNA sequence analysis. Fluorescence detection of the DNA fragments is accomplished by means of a fluorophore covalently attached to the oligonucleotide primer used in enzymatic DNA sequence analysis. A different coloured fluorophore is used for each of the reactions specific for the bases A, C, G and T. The reaction mixtures are combined and co-electrophoresed down a single polyacrylamide gel tube, the separated fluorescent bands of DNA are detected near the bottom of the tube, and the sequence information is acquired directly by computer.Nucleic Acids Res. 1985 Apr 11;13(7):2399-412.

(BPC) The Molecular Biology Core Facilities has had a continuous web presence since 1992 and began receiving primer sequence for high throughput DNA synthesis by web forms in 1995 when new high volume DNA synthesizers were brought on-line. Since 2004 all interactions between researchers and the core services have been moved to a web-based LIMS system. The MBCF is constantly evaluating new instrumentation which could eventually become a shared resource. The future massively parallel DNA sequencers which can sequence entire genomes in just a few days, (454, Solexa+Illumina, Helicos, SOLiD, Visigen, PacBio, ION Torrent, Nanopore), are being made available to researchers by various methods. In 2009 the Heliscope from Helicos BioSciences began being evaluated in the genomics facility.GenomeWeb InSequence; Oct 13, 2009  Interview of Paul T Morrison discussing Heliscope in a Core Lab.http://www.genomeweb.com/sequencing/dana- farbers-paul-morrison-running-helicos-sequencer-core-facility After successfully completing 2,365 Chip-Seq samples the Helicos service was shut down in 2011. An Illumina MiSeq was evaluated on multiple projects and now a series of three MiSeqs have been streamlined for fast analysis of Next Gen samples. Library prep has been automated on an IntegenX Apollo 324 and Beckman robots and several instruments have been incorporated into quality control of samples including the Pippin Prep by Sage Biosciences, an Agilent Tapestation Bioanalyzer and an Echo QPCR system from Illumina. The Mass Spectrometry proteomics facility has also undergone a large expansion to undertake more complex high-throughput projects as part of the Blais Proteomics Center. Expansion of genomics in 2018 included three, now five Illumina NextSeq 500s as well as an Illumina Neoprep Library prep robot (which was returned as a rebate on another NextSeq500). The current platform for genomics in 2019 changes faster than a wiki page. MBCF can send you sample into a pipeline that is small and proof of concept or large production runs. We can run with Illumina, Pacbio, or Oxford Nanopore instruments. But that was yesterday. The big deal is library prep and amplification. We are a small production NGS lab that has done a thousand different types of NGS. We know how to prep a sample. If you want whole genome of human or chicken, go to BGI in China. They are much cheaper. That is where we send our full genome samples. In 2019 to keep up with demand MBCF obtained an Illumina NovaSeq Genomic Sequencer. In the second week a weekend run analyzed 8 trillion nucleotides in 27 billion paired end 150 reads. This instrument allows greater flexibility allowing multiple sized projects run at the same time.

Its main settlements are the villages of Compton and Shawford.  Description  The word compton means village in a combe and aptly describes the settlement as it primarily consists of a long street on the side of a chalk valley. Shawford is notable for having the longest railway viaduct in Hampshire (now known as Hockley Railway Viaduct). This is over in length and high. Disused since 1966, the viaduct was initially threatened with demolition when the M3 motorway was proposed but after much protest it was incorporated into the scheme. The two halves of the parish are linked by Shawford Down which runs alongside the River Itchen. However they are now symbolically separated by the motorway with Compton on its west side and Shawford on its east. Geology The parish lies on the Upper Cretaceous chalk at the northern edge of the Hampshire Basin, dipping south from the Winchester anticline, with successively younger beds being exposed from north to south. In the north the Seaford Chalk formation of Santonian age makes up Compton Down. South of this the Newhaven Chalk outcrops in the dry valley running down from Oliver's Battery to Shawford. In the south of the parish the Culver Chalk of Campanian age is largely overlain by a layer of 'clay-with-flints' weathered out of the chalk. In the east the chalk is cut through by the Itchen valley and overlain by calcareous tufa.British Geological Survey (2002), Winchester. England and Wales Sheet 299. Solid and Drift Geology, 1:50,000 Series geological map, Keyworth, Nottingham: British Geological Survey, A feature of the geology is the hill immediately southwest of the village of Shawford known as Shawford Down. This area is noted for its rich variety of habitats and the grazed pasture supports a wealth of flora and fauna, including notable insects and wildflowers.  Parish church  All Saints' Church All Saints' church in Compton is unusual in that it has two naves and two chancels, the original Norman constructions being supplemented by a new nave and chancel in 1905.  Amenities  National Cycle Route 23 passes through the parish, as do bus services provided by Bluestar. The M3 motorway also goes through the parish, with junction 11 to the north and junction 12 to the south. Shawford railway station is served by stopping services on the South Western main line. The parish is crossed from east to west by the Monarch's Way long distance footpath, and from north to south by the Itchen Way. Compton is represented in the Hampshire Cricket League as one half of Compton & Chandlers Ford CC following the merging of Compton & Shawford CC and Chandlers Ford CC in 1995. The club plays its home games at the Memorial playing fields, just off of Shepards Lane.Compton & Chandler's Ford CC In media Shawford was the location for Victor Meldrew's death the One Foot in the Grave episode \\"Things Aren't Simple Any More\\". It is referred to in Robyn Hitchcock's song \\"Winchester\\". Shawford railway station was featured in a 1974 film starring Sophia Loren, a remake of Brief Encounter, as was Winchester station (though most filming took place at Brockenhurst). It caused great excitement in the village; a large crowd watched the actress being filmed getting out of a car on the forecourt. Jon Tufnell, the leader of the band Plastic Toys, is a former resident of Compton and it was in his home studio in the village that he recorded the album For Tonight Only which included the single \\"Let Me Feel The Love\\" which charted at Number 30 in the UK Indie Chart in 2007.

Biography =Childhood= Details about Bhagawan Nityananda's birth are relatively unknown. According to his disciples, Nityananda was found as an abandoned infant in Tuneri village, Kozhikode, Kerala, India by a lady named Uniamma Nair, who was married to Chathu Nair. The Nair couple adopted this child and took care of him along with their own five children. Nityananda was named as Raman by his foster parents. The Nair couple were farmers, who also took care of the farms owned by a wealthy lawyer named Ishwar Iyer, who greatly trusted them.Page 4 Life of Bhagawan Nityananda & Chidakasha Geeta, by Deepa Kodikal Publisher Surendra Kalyanpur, Mumbai, 2007 Nityananda's foster father died when he was three and his foster mother when he was six. Before dying she handed over her responsibility of Nityananda to Ishwar Iyer. =Spiritual life= Bhagawan Nityananda Samadhi Even in childhood, Bhagawan Nityananda seemed to be in an unusually advanced spiritual state, which gave rise to the belief that he was born enlightened. He was eventually given the name Nityananda, which means, \\"always in bliss\\". Before the age of twenty, Nityananda became a wandering yogi, spending time on yogic studies and practices in the Himalayas and other places. By 1920, he was back in southern India. Settled in southern India, Nityananda gained a reputation for creating miracles and cures. He started building an ashram near Kanhangad, Kerala state. The hill temple and Ashram in Kanhangad are now pilgrim centres. The Guruvan, a forest in the hills nearby where Bhagawan sat on penance, is now a pilgrim retreat. By 1923, Nityananda had wandered to the Tansa Valley in Maharashtra state. There, his reputation as a miracle worker attracted people from as far away as Mumbai, though he never took credit for any miracles. He said, \\"Everything that happens, happens automatically by the will of God.\\" Nityananda gave a great deal of help to the local adivasis. Nityananda set up a school, as well as providing food and clothing for them. =Guru= As a Guru, Bhagawan Nityananda gave relatively little by way of verbal teachings. Starting in the early 1920s, his devotees in Mangalore would sit with him in the evenings. Most of the time he was silent, though occasionally he would give teachings. A female devotee named Tulsiamma (Tulsi Amma) (1882-1945) wrote down some of his teachings and his answers to her specific queries. Later, these notes were compiled and published in the Kannada language and came to be known as the Chidakasha Geeta. Some believe that Nityananda had the power to transmit spiritual energy (shaktipat) to people through non-verbal means. He could also be extremely fiery and intimidating in his behaviour, even to the point of throwing rocks on occasion. This was his way of deterring people who were not serious in their spiritual aspirations, or who came to him with ulterior motives. In 1936, he went to the Shiva temple in the village of Ganeshpuri and asked if he could stay there. The family that looked after the temple agreed and built a hut for him. As his visitors and followers increased, the hut expanded and became an ashram. To the people around him, he was an avadhuta: one who is absorbed in the transcendental state. =Final Years And Death (Samadhi)= Bhagawan Nityananda died on 8 August 1961 at age 63. His samadhi is located in Ganeshpuri at the Samadhi Mandir. There is also a shrine dedicated to him in the Gurudev Siddha Peeth ashram at Ganeshpuri. His ashram, tourist hostel, and other buildings associated with his life in Ganeshpuri are preserved by the Shree Bhimeshwar Sadguru Nityanand Sanstha Ganeshpuri. This trust is also responsible for his samadhi shrine in Ganeshpuri, which is a pilgrimage site. A trust at Kanhangad looks after the Ashram and temples located there. The trust also runs a few educational institutions and a dharmasala. Bhagawan Nityananda’s Guru A life size statue of Bhagawan Nityananda at Bunt Bhavan, Mumbai, India According to Bhagawan Nityananda's biographers, the identity of Nityananda's guru is a mystery. According to Healy, Nityananda did not have a guru.John Paul Healy (2010), Yearning to Belong: Discovering a New Religious Movement, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., p.10 In one of his talks, his student Swami Muktananda said Nityananda’s Guru was an unknown Siddha purusha from Kerala.

It is in the historic barony of Glenarm Lower and the civil parish of Layd, and is part of Causeway Coast and Glens district. It is on the A2 coast road between Glenariff and Cushendun, in the Antrim Coast and Glens Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. It lies in the shadow of the table topped Lurigethan Mountain and at the meeting point of three of the Glens of Antrim: Glenaan, Glenballyemon and Glencorp. This part of the Irish coastline is separated from Scotland by the North Channel, with the Mull of Kintyre about 16 miles away. In the 2001 Census it had a population of 1,241 people, with a 2008 estimate of 1,363. Much of the historic character of the 19th century settlement on the north bank of the River Dall remains. In 1973 it was designated as only the second Conservation Area in Northern Ireland, and includes the largely intact Irish Georgian buildings of the town's four original streets. Since 1990, Cushendall has hosted the Heart Of The Glens festival every August. Thomas D'Arcy McGee, a father of Canadian Confederation, spent his childhood in Cushendall when his father, who worked for the Coast Guard Service, was posted there.K. McGoogan, \\"Celtic Lightning: How the Scots and the Irish Created a Canadian Nation\\". Patrick Crean Editions, 2015, p. 104 2011 Census Cushendall is classified as a village, and the population of Cushendall on census day (27 March 2011) was 1,280 people. Of these: *99% were from a white ethnic group *92% were from a Catholic background, and 6% were from a Protestant or other Christian background *53.5% indicated that they had an Irish national identity, 34% a Northern Irish national identity, and 15% a British national identity (respondents could choose more than one)NISRA: Cushendall settlement Places of interest The Curfew Tower. =Curfew Tower= The Curfew Tower in the centre of the village was built by then landlord of the town, Francis Turnley, in 1817, to confine riotous prisoners. Dan McBride, an army pensioner, was given the job of permanent garrison and was armed with one musket, a bayonet, a brace of pistols and a thirteen-feet- long pike. The tower is now owned by artist Bill Drummond. =Oisin's Grave= Oisín's Grave, off the main Cushendall to Ballymoney road, is a megalithic court cairn on a hillside in Lubitavish, near the Glenann River. It is believed to be the burial place of Oísín - the Celtic Warrior Poet. A stone cairn was erected here in 1989 in memory of John Hewitt, the poet of the Glens. =Layd Church and Churchyard= The ruins of Layd Church (grid ref:324428), a Franciscan foundation possibly partially from the 13th century, are found 1.5 km north of Cushendall. They are also accessible by a cliff path from Cushendall, as well as by road. There are old vaults in the churchyard and it was one of the main burial places of the MacDonnells. There is a stone cross memorial to Dr James MacDonnell, one of the organisers of the last Belfast Festival of Harpists in 1792 and pioneer of the use of chloroform in surgery. By the gate of the churchyard is a holestone and nearby two 'corp stones' on which coffins were rested. Layd Church saw service as a parish church from 1306 until about 1790. =Red Bay Castle= Red Bay Castle, situated between the villages of Cushendall and Waterfoot. Built by the Bisset family in the 14th century and later occupied by the MacDonnells, one of the outposts of the Kingdom of Dál Riata. =Glenariff Forest Park= Glenariff Forest Park, 5 miles inland from Cushendall, covers an area of 1185 hectares. In the park are two small rivers containing spectacular waterfalls, tranquil pools and stretches of fast flowing water tumbling through rocky gorges. There is a café, toilets and an exhibition centre. Four way-marked trails of varying length (1–9 km) wind through the forest leading you into some of the park's wooded areas. One follows the Glenariff River with its famous waterfalls and passes through the National Nature Reserve. The Troubles in Cushendall On the night of 23 June 1922, in the aftermath of the Irish War of Independence, several trucks of Ulster Special Constabulary officers and British soldiers arrived in Cushendall and fired on civilians. Special Constables shot and killed three young Catholic men at close range: James (Seamus) McAllister, John Gore and John Hill. They claimed they were ambushed by the Irish Republican Army and returned fire, but a British government inquiry concluded that this was not true. The report was not made public for almost a century.Lawlor, Pearse. The Outrages: The IRA and the Ulster Special Constabulary in the Border Campaign. Mercier Press, 2011. pp.302-309 There were further violent incidents during the Troubles of the late 20th century. * Sergeant Joseph Campbell, a Catholic Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) officer, was shot dead on 25 February 1977 as he locked up the local RUC station. A wrongly blamed RUC officer, Charles McCormick, was cleared of the murder and also other charges including possession of explosives, firearms and armed robbery.

The first county senior championship was won in 1981, when the team captained by John Delargy beat Ballycastle Mc Quillans after a replay. The club have since won 13 County Championships. They have also won numerous underage tournaments. River Dall On 17 March 2016, Cushendall got into the All Ireland Club Hurling Championships but lost. = Golf = Cushendall Golf Club is a tricky little nine-hole course presenting many challenges for those wanting to improve their short game. The course is a great place for young players to develop and has produced numerous successful amateurs over the years. The course is located in a superb wooded valley with the Abhainn Dala (River Dall) running through its centre to the sea. = Sailing= Established in 1951, Cushendall Sailing & Boating Club is the ideal place to learn basic introductory, as well as advanced Sailing skills. The club is situated in Red Bay and the views of the surrounding Glens of Antrim make a stunning backdrop for those on the waves. Cushendall CSBC has a sailing school which runs throughout the summer using RYA's learn-to-sail scheme. The school welcomes all ages and abilities, ensuring progression is achieved by each individual student. = Running = The second Saturday of August each year during the Heart of the Glens Festival the Lurig Run takes place. This challenge is a 3.5 mile run consisting of a 1500 ft climb up the face of the Lurigethan mountain. Growing in popularity amongst the running elite it is seen as one of the most challenging organised runs across Northern Ireland. 400 people compete each year.  Tourism  Holiday accommodation in the area ranges from Self Catering to Bed & Breakfast and caravan and camping. Cushendall has three caravan and camping sites. Cushendall offers a diverse range of shops, which offer local gifts and crafts, as well as many other items. There is also an annual vintage car rally which is held in the village..Vintage Enthusiasts Promoting Good Relations Ballymoney Times (1 August 2011)  References   External links * North Antrim Community Network - Cushendall * Cushendall website Category:Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty in Northern Ireland Category:Villages in County Antrim Category:Civil parish of Layd Category:Townlands of County Antrim ","title":"Cushendall"},{"id":"3607326","text":"Alpa Reflex Alpa was formerly a Swiss camera design company and manufacturer of 35 mm SLR cameras. The current owners bought the company name after bankruptcy of the original company and the company exists today as a designer and manufacturer of high-end medium-format cameras (Website alpa.ch). History ALPA 11si Chrome 28mm f3.5mm Angenieux lens Ser#64064 Purchased 1991 Photo by James EagerALPA 11si Black 24mm f3.5mm Angenieux lens Ser#64205 Purchased 1991 Photo by James Eager Alpa was an offshoot of the Pignons S.A. company, which made a particular part (pinions) for Swiss watches. They made high-end, all-metal 35mm cameras with a similar high-end but smaller-volume market to Germany's Leica, Contax, and Rolleiflex. In the late 1930s, Pignons invited engineer Jacques Bolsky to design a camera for them. This he did with the Alpa-Reflex in the 1940s. In true Swiss fashion, each camera was individually crafted. Thus, production was low, but quality and prices were high. Even these days, collectible Alpa cameras can fetch quite a high auction price. It is estimated that as few as 40,000 cameras of all models of Alpa were made during the company's 40-year history. Allowing for certain gaps, the serial numbers would support that, as the last cameras made (in about 1990) carried serial numbers of only 64,xxx. There is an ongoing question concerning which camera company was first with such innovations as the quick-return mirror, through-the-lens metering, cells in prism housings and the bayonet lens mount. Alpa was a contender for being first with each of these innovations and several others. Unfortunately, Alpa did not have the resources to keep up with the technological advances that the mainstream camera companies were introducing in the 1970s and sales began to decline. It is not clear whether the lack of technological \\"innovation\\" was due to lack of money, or actually a choice made by the company against the automation brought about by other companies. A more popularly priced \\"Alpa\\" camera made in Japan by Chinon was introduced. It used M42 screw mount lenses, but it did not sell very well, partly because the premium Alpa lenses could not be used on it. (The Si2000 used the M42 Screw mount, the Si3000 used the Pentax K mount.) Neither model was popular and they are not considered true Alpas by collectors. Some feel the Japanese Alpa was a mistake that hurt the company. The Kern Macro Switar lens was a 50 mm lens at F1.8 or F1.9. It was an apochromat, and is still highly regarded as possibly the best standard lens ever offered. Other apochromats offered by Alpa included the 100 mm F2 and 150 mm F2.8 Kinoptik lenses. A total of six different models of motor drive and magazine back were reputed to have been made. Two models each for the 9d, 10d, and 11 series cameras, one full-frame, one half-frame. Estimates of less than 250 were made. The example in the photo is full frame, 11 series. Unlike Nikon magazine backs, the Alpa ones were designed to allow for an entire 100-foot roll of 35 mm film to be inserted at once, and to allow for the operator to open the takeup-side individually to cut off a portion of the film in a changing bag for processing without unloading the rest of the roll. The motor drive resembled some oil pumps in that the motor rocked a lever back and forth to shoot the normal trigger after a second gear moved the normal shutter cocking mechanism. In actual use, photos can be shot at approximately 1-second intervals. Both wall transformers and NiCad battery packs were originally offered. The example unit has a wall transformer, but only photographs of the battery packs may survive. The company retained the same lens mount on the Swiss made cameras from 1942 until they ended production. The back focus of the body was the thinnest of any 35 mm camera, and as a result, it was possible to make adapters to use lenses designed for almost any other 35 mm SLR on an Alpa. Adapters offered included Exakta, M42 (automatic diaphragm and manual), Nikon (auto and manual), Leicaflex, T-mount, and Contax. Other adapters included one to allow mounting Alpa lenses to C-mount movie cameras and another to mount the Alpa bodies to a microscope. Alpa did not make their own lenses, and sourced them through some of the best lens makers—Angenieux, Kern, Kinoptik, Schneider, and others. They were the only company to guarantee the optical quality of the lenses they sold. The clearness of the pentaprism in the Alpa models, and the use of \\"rings\\" of different surfaces in the eyepiece of the 11 series especially made them a great choice for using on a T-mount, attached to large telescopes. Coupled with the manual mirror raise switch, even the vibration of the mirror slap was removed. The company can no longer compete with manufacturers from outside Europe. The fatal blow, however, is delivered by problems within the company. Pignons SA declares bankruptcy in 1990. The last ALPA model produced by Pignons SA is the ALPA 11. By February 29, 1996, Capaul & Weber, Zurich, at long last acquired the worldwide rights to the brand-name ALPA. The new owners aim is to continue the tradition of quality established with the classic 35-mm ALPA reflex cameras and to enter into the field of medium-format cameras. On 18 April 1996 the internet domain alpa.ch was registered and soon the first website went online. At Photokina 1998 the first two ALPA 12 models are shown. Both were for medium-format: ALPA 12 WA (Wide Angle) and ALPA 12 SWA (Shift Wide Angle). Since then ALPA became one of the leading companies for technical cameras in medium format (first analog/film up to 6x9 and nowadays primarily with high- end digital backs).

A dog licence is required in some jurisdictions to be the keeper of a dog. Usually a dog-licence identifying number is issued to the owner, along with a dog tag bearing the identifier and a contact number for the registering organization. If a stray pet is found with the tag, a rescuer can call the registering organization to get current contact information for the dog's owner. Licensing a dog might require additional actions on the owner's part, such as ensuring that the dog has a current rabies vaccination. In many jurisdictions a fee, which is usually small, must be paid. Licences typically must be renewed annually or after some small number of years. Licensing information worldwide =Australia= Dog licences are mandated by state and territory legislation but are issued by local governments (e.g., city or shire councils).Australian Official Registers: Ownership and Use: pets Hence the cost of a licence and the format of the licence tag vary across the country. Some areas, such as Victoria, require cat registration and microchipping also.All About Cats Responsible Pet Ownership Program, State Government of Victoria =Ireland= Dog licences are required. There are three types of licences :* Individual dog licence – covers one dog for a period of 12 months :* General dog licence – for owners of kennels for a period of 12 months :* Lifetime of the dog licence – for the lifetime of the dog for which the licence is issued =Italy= Since 2008 an identification microchip is mandatory for each dog over 2 months, and a small fee is associated with it, but it does not need to be renewed. =Netherlands= Dogs must be registered and a yearly tax is paid to the municipality based on the number of dogs. The amount differs between municipalities; for example in The Hague it is €112.80 for the first dog, €176.76 for the second one, and €224.16 for the third one. Other municipalities, such as Amsterdam, no longer observe this law. =New Zealand= Under the Dog Control Act 1996 all dogs over 3 months old are required to be registered with the city or district council the dog usually resides in. As a prerequisite, all dogs classified as dangerous or menacing, and all dogs first registered in New Zealand after 1 July 2006 must be microchipped before they can be registered. :All dog registrations expire yearly on 30 June, and must be renewed by 31 July. Each registered dog must wear a tag specifying the council, registration expiry date, and registration number of the dog, with the colour of the tag changing every year for easy identification (e.g. tags for the 2013/14 year are red). Fees for registration differ between councils, and also differ according to factors such as whether the dog is neutered, living in an urban or rural area, classed as dangerous or menacing, and whether the owner is a responsible dog owner. Fees for working dogs (herding dogs, police dogs, drug dogs, etc.) are generally lower than for pets, and seeing-eye or hearing-ear dogs are generally free or minimal cost to register. =United Kingdom= In England, Wales and Scotland, dog licensing was abolished in 1987. Prior to this dog licences were mandatory, but the requirement was widely ignored, with only about half of owners having one. The final rate for a dog licence was 37 pence, reduced from 37½p when the halfpenny was withdrawn in 1984. This figure was an exact conversion from 7/6 (seven shillings and sixpence) on decimalisation in 1971. The revenue went to local authorities. In 2016 it became a requirement that all dogs in England and Wales have a microchip; Scottish legislation was also changed to make microchipping of dogs compulsory from 2016. In Northern Ireland, dog licences are required under the Dogs (Northern Ireland) Order 1983. dog licences cost £12.50 a year, with reductions for pensioners and owners of neutered dogs. Crown dependencies ;Bailiwick of Guernsey Dog owners in Guernsey are required to obtain a licence for each dog owned and a dog tax is payable each year. ;Isle of Man Dog licences are required. =United States= At least some states, municipalities, and other jurisdictions require a dog license and rabies vaccination, and a license expires before the vaccine does. To prevent animal overpopulation, some jurisdictions charge a lower licensing fee if the owner presents veterinary proof that the dog has been spayed or neutered.

Description Size comparison Physically similar to the North American Stegosaurus, Tuojiangosaurus is the best understood of the Chinese stegosauridae. It was around long and high. In 2010, Gregory S. Paul estimated the weight of a 6.5 metre long Tuojiangosaurus at 2.8 tonnes.Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 221 In 1977, Dong provided a diagnosis but this largely consisted of traits shared with other stegosaurus. In 1990, Peter Malcolm Galton pointed out an autapomorphy: the spines of the vertebrae of the tail base possess spines with bony skirts running from their front to the sides.Galton, P.M., 1990, \\"Stegosauria\\", in: D.B. Weishampel, P. Dodson, & H. Osmólska (eds.), The Dinosauria. University of California Press, pp. 435-455 Tuojiangosaurus has the typical narrow and low head, bulky body, and low teeth of other stegosaurus. The limbs, especially the arms, are rather short. There are at least twenty-five dentary teeth. The teeth have a thick base, cingulum, merging at the inside into a triangular vertical median ridge. The dorsal vertebrae have tall neural arches. The shoulder blade has a rectangular acromion.Galton, P.M., and P. Upchurch, 2004, \\"Stegosauria\\", pp. 343-362 in: D.B. Weishampel, P. Dodson, and H. Osmolska (eds.), The Dinosauria, 2nd Edition. University of California Press, Berkeley, CA Restoration Reconstructed skeleton Like Kentrosaurus, Tuojiangosaurus had two rows of plates along the spine, which became taller over the hip region. Those at the neck and front trunk were rounded or pear-shaped; the plates at the rear back became more triangular and pointed. All plates have a thickened central section, as if they were modified spikes. Dong estimated there were about seventeen pairs of plates and spikes. Tuojiangosaurus had at least two outward-pointing, rather robust, spikes on each side of the end of the tail, angled at approximately 45 degrees to the vertical. In stegosauridae, this spike arrangement has become affectionately known as the \\"thagomizer\\". Dong thought it were possible that there were four pairs of spikes. Paul, based on \\"Chungkingosaurus sp. 3\\" specimen CV 00208, interpreted the thagomizer as a \\"pin-cushion array\\", with two vertical pairs of thick spikes and a third pair of narrow spikes pointing to behind. Discovery Skull of the mount In 1974, during construction of the Wujiaba dam in Zigong, Sichuan, the remains of stegosaurus were found. The type and only species of Tuojiangosaurus, Tuojiangosaurus multispinosus, was named and described in 1977 (exactly a hundred years after the naming of Stegosaurus by Othniel Charles Marsh) by Dong Zhiming, Zhou Shiwu, Li Xuanmin and Chang Yijong. The generic name is derived from the River () Tuo. The specific name is derived from Latin multus, \\"many\\", and spina, \\"spine\\".Z. Dong, X. Li, S. Zhou and Y. Zhang, 1977, \\"On the stegosaurian remains from Zigong (Tzekung), Szechuan province\\", Vertebrata PalAsiatica 15(4): 307-312 A mounted skeleton at the Beijing Museum of Natural History, confronting a Yangchuanosaurus The holotype, CV 209, was found in a layer of the Upper Shaximiao Formation, dating from the Oxfordian- Kimmeridgian. It consists of a rather complete skeleton that however lacks parts of the skull., lower jaws, tail and limbs. In 1977, it represented the most complete stegosaurus skeleton found in Asia. The paratype was specimen CV 210, a sacrum. Subsequently, more material has been referred, including juveniles. This complemented the holotype with elements of the skull, especially the braincase, and the lower jaws. A mounted skeleton of Tuojiangosaurus multispinosus is on display at the Municipal Museum of Chongqing. In addition, a mounted cast is on display at the Natural History Museum, in London. Another mount is displayed in the Beijing Museum of Natural History in a conflict with Yangchuanosaurus. A cast of the original fossilised dinosaur skeleton, found at Wujiaba Quarry 1977 is also on display at Bolton Museum, United Kingdom. Classification Tuojiangosaurus was by Dong placed in Stegosauridae in 1977, more precisely in the Stegosaurinae. In 2004, a cladistic analysis by Galton recovered Tuojiangosaurus in a rather derived position, as a sister species of Chialingosaurus. An analysis by Maidment and Wei in 2006 confirmed its status as a member of the Stegosauridae.S.C.R. Maidment and G.

Her parents, wishing to protect her, sent her to a convent school and a private tutor. The only times she left her house was to attend Mass or pray at the sanctuary of Saint Peter. The legend of her life is possibly little more than that.Encyclopedia of Catholic Saints, Vol. 10, (1966) Chilton Books, pp. 99–100 The murder of Irene, lithography by Manuel Macedo and Alfredo Roque Gameiro, 1904. Legend Legend says that Irene was born in Nabância, present-day Tomar, Portugal. She was born into an influential family, and her parents, wishing to protect her, sent her to a convent school and a private tutor. The only times she left her house was to attend Mass or pray at the sanctuary of Saint Peter. A young nobleman named Britald saw her once and fell in love with her. Every time she left to go to church, he would follow her. Eventually he came forward with his proposal to court her; however, Irene made it clear that she would never marry him. When Britald became depressed, Irene hastened to make it clear to him that the reason for her celibacy was that she had given herself to God as a nun. Meanwhile, her tutor, a monk named Remigius (or Remígio) made improper advances to her, and when she declined, quit and spread vicious rumors about her. When asked why he was no longer tutoring the girl, he replied that he had left upon having learned that she was pregnant. In addition, he managed to give her a drink that brought about her belly to inflate. All these news circulated around the town, and eventually Britald learned of her supposed infidelity. Enraged, he hired a mercenary soldier to kill her. So, as Irene was returning home from visiting an elderly disabled man, the assassin approached from behind and killed her with a single stroke of his sword. Veneration Her body was thrown into river Nabão, that flows into River Tagus. Later, it was recovered uncorrupted from this river by Benedictines near the town of Scalabis. Legend says that her uncle abbot Celius had received from Christ a revelation about the true story of her niece and the location of her body. The monks gave her a proper burial, and spread her cultus. Eventually, so great was the reverence paid to the virgin saint, that the name of the town of Scalabis was changed to Santarém (\\"Saint Irene\\"). Thus, Irene is the patron saint of Tomar and namesake Santarém. Feast Day is October 20th.

Biography =Early years= He was born in Durango, Biscay, the son of Andrés Ruiz de Gamboa and Nafarra de Berriz, and served as a youth in the royal navy in the Levant. Before the age of 18, he traveled to Peru, eventually arriving in Chile in 1552. Remaining in the area, he would participate in the Arauco War, being named in 1565 the lieutenant general for the governor at the time Rodrigo de Quiroga, with whom he had familial ties after marrying his daughter Isabel de Quiroga. =Governor of Chiloé= He achieved the conquest of the island of Chiloé by subduing the docile Cuncos Indians. He named the island New Galicia, and on November 12, 1567, founded the city of Santiago de Castro there. He was governor of Chiloé, and in 1568 Melchor Bravo de Saravia named him general and chief justice of Arauco and Tucapel. Given his experience in the Arauco War, the Real Audiencia entrusted him with the direction of the war. However, in 1569 he suffered a complete defeat in the Battle of Catirai, losing his encomienda and suffering a marginalization from public life. =Governor of Chile= He returned to prominence when Rodrigo de Quiroga received his second mandate. Because of the sickness of the governor, Gamboa was again entrusted with the leadership of the war effort. In 1577, Quiroga named Gamboa his successor in his will, and just before his death, made him interim governor. All this was allowed because of privileges granted by the king at the time, Philip II of Spain. As soon as Quiroga died, on February 25, 1580, the cabildo of Santiago sent messengers to Gamboa to ask him to return to the capital to receive the mandate. He was sworn in on March 8, 1580. He then pursued the ratification of his mandate by the Viceroy of Peru and the king. =Tasa de Gamboa= The Viceroy delayed nearly a year in his confirmation, and the king took an even more ambivalent view towards him. In order to fully secure the trust of the king, Gamboa thought that the achievement of the king's wishes that the Indians be protected would increase his standing. For this he replaced the Tasa de Santillán, which itself had never really been enforced, with another which is known today as the Tasa de Gamboa. This replaced the tribute of labor required of the Indians with a simple monetary tax. The Indians of the repartamientos were required to pay nine pesos annually in the diocese of Santiago, and seven in La Imperial. The post of corregidor was created to oversee the tax system and the protection of the Indians. These functionaries were to be supported by a portion of the tax, but a majority of it went to the encomenderos. This new system provoked increasing confrontations with the encomenderos, as they were sure (and later proved correct) that the Indians wouldn't pay the new tribute and would instead dedicate themselves to leisure. The new enemies that Gamboa thus created for himself began to pass rumors to the Viceroy, who each day had a more negative image of Gamboa. Amidst all this, Gamboa had to respond to a rebellion by his lieutenant governor Lope de Azócar, who opposed his administration. However, the governor was able to gain control of the situation, pressuring Azocar, and finally chasing him from Chile. Gamboa spent the final years of his mandate (1581-1583) in the south of the country, engaged in permanent conflict with the natives. On June 25, 1580 he had founded a city named San Bartolomé Chillán y Gamboa, which became known as Chillán. The situation of the war during his tenure only worsened, since the rebellion of the Mapuches was joined by the Huilliches, who previously had not been aggressive, and by the Pehuenche nearby Chillán. =Final years= As a result of the setbacks, Gamboa had to send for reinforcements from Spain and Peru. These arrived well enough (although there were many desertions during the journey), but under the command of Alonso de Sotomayor, Gamboa's successor designated by the king. Gamboa was in Chillán when he heard the news, and handed over his command and treated his successor with courtesy. However, Sotomayor had also come to hear the innumerable complaints against Gamboa and judge his guilt. As a result, he had to detain Gamboa in the government house in Santiago, letting him out only on bail. Eventually, he was absolved and given his freedom. Gamboa had long waited for the permission of the Audiencia of Lima to travel to Spain to justify his conduct to the king. However, he never realized this trip, living his last days in Santiago away from the interference of the government. He died at Santiago in 1590.

Personal life He was born in Bergen as a son of customs officer Werner Hosewinckel Christie (1785–1872) and Hansine Langsted (1802–1864). He was a grandnephew of Werner Hosewinckel Christie, nephew of Wilhelm Frimann Koren Christie and Edvard Eilert Christie, a brother of Hans Langsted Christie, a first cousin of writer Johan Koren Christie and physicist Hartvig Caspar Christie and a granduncle of politician Hartvig Caspar Christie. He was an uncle of agricultural teacher Werner Hosewinckel Christie, and through him a granduncle of pianist Amalie Christie, Johan Koren Christie and Werner Hosewinckel Christie. His second cousin Edvard Edvardsen Christie had the daughter Sara Stockfleth Christie. His niece Anna Christie married Jens Zetlitz Monrad Kielland, and bore the children Jacob Christie Kielland and Else Christie Kielland. Career Christie was educated at Polytechnic School of Hannover from 1849 to 1852 and in Karlsruhe from 1852 to 1854, where he was a student of Friedrich Eisenlohr. He returned to Bergen in 1855, and then opened an architect's office in Kristiania in 1858. He was commissioned by the Society for the Preservation of Ancient Norwegian Monuments, and through his work drawing remnants of medieval architecture, he became intimately familiar with such structures in Norway. He led restoration and preservation of a number of important medieval structures, including Håkonshallen and St Mary's Church in Bergen. He also designed several churches of his own, combining Neo-Gothic architecture with the stave church style, decades before stave church inspiration became widespread. Churches include New Borgund Church, erected between 1865 and 1868. Haraldshaugen, a national monument in Haugesund, was raised in 1872 to commemorate the Battle of Hafrsfjord. \\"Haraldshaugen, the national monument\\" (Haugesund Today) (in Norwegian)His most important work was probably the restoration of the Nidaros Cathedral, which he nearly completed before dying. His work here spanned the years from 1872 to 1906. Christie also chaired the Society for the Preservation of Ancient Norwegian Monuments branch in Trondhjem. Christie was decorated as a Commander, First Class of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav in 1897. He was a Knight of the Danish Order of the Dannebrog and the Prussian Order of the Crown. He did not marry, and died in September 1906 in Trondhjem.

Lucas in 1911 Frederic Augustus Lucas, Sc.D. (March 25, 1852 – February 9, 1929) was a zoologist who served as a curator of the Brooklyn Museum and director of the American Museum of Natural History. He was an expert on the osteology and anatomy of birds. Biography =Career= Frederic A. Lucas was prominent in the Great American Museum movement, which sought to bring Natural Science to the American public. He eventually became Curator in Chief of the Brooklyn Museum, in Brooklyn, New York, (1904) and subsequently enjoyed an appointment as director at the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan (1911). =Formative years= Lucas in 1918 The son of Augustus Henry, a merchant seaman who was captain of a sailing vessel, he accompanied his father on two long voyages, the first (1861-1862) at the age of 9 and the second (1869-1870) when he was 17. His mother was Eliza Oliver, and his paternal great-grandmother Ruby Fuller was a descendant of Dr Samuel Fuller on the Mayflower. He became fascinated with sea life, especially the marine birds, many of which he was able to snare, skin and prepare as mounted specimens. From this he developed an ambition to become a taxidermist and entered Ward's Natural Science Establishment at Rochester, New York, to learn the techniques involved. Perhaps because of the manner of his development he seems to have had little regard for investigative science per se. As a consequence, he had little opportunity for formal education and he never sought any. After the 11 years he spent at Ward's, he bragged that, \\"during those days he never read through any scientific book, never attended a course of scientific lectures, never did an hour's laboratory work, nor made a microscope slide\\", his interests being confined to avian osteology and the mounting and tagging of specimens for exhibition. He also claimed that sharks were essentially incapable of attacking man. Yet his competency in this area was sufficient to provide him an appointment to mount and prepare avian specimens at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, DC (1882) at the age of 21 where he was given the title of Curator. =Legacy= Lucas came to be recognized by his contemporaries as an authority on ancient animals. His description of himself was that of \\"all round\\" naturalist, a type specimen he regarded regretfully as fast disappearing. Because of his associations at the National Museum he was able to meet and associate with many men of this type, Hornaday, Akeley, Ward, Howell, etc., people whose recognition was based on their writings as explorers rather than as academicians. He never regarded as himself as deficient in that respect. After instruction in the techniques of scientific writing and manuscript preparation by a friend early in his career, he published more than 350 articles, primarily in the area of avian osteology but also relating to natural history and the role of the museum and public education. =Death= Frederic Lucas died on February 9, 1929, at his home in Flushing, New York at the age of 76. He was buried at Plymouth, Massachusetts.\\"Frederic Augustus Lucas,\\" Evolution, vol. 2, no. 2 (March 1929), pg. 5 He was married to Annie Edgar from 1884 and they had two daughters.

The tone of the album was a noticeable departure from the sound of 1977, with the much darker edge reflecting the mood of the band at the time, who were suffering from burn out as a result of near non-stop touring since their 1996 album 1977. Despite this, the songs still contain the trademark elements of Ash songs. The album also had more of an American indie and grunge influence from the likes of The Smashing Pumpkins, Hüsker Dü, Nirvana and Nada Surf along with the Weezer albums Weezer and Pinkerton.

History The Biscuit Burners began around a kitchen table, with friends, dogs and musicians roaming in and out of their Asheville, North Carolina home. Early founding member Lizzie Hamilton had previously worked with Steep Canyon Rangers. As lore has it, a few biscuits did get burned during the making of this award winning band that stole the hearts of many during their time together. Beginning as an all-female group, the band quickly morphed into the core four of Mary Lucey (bass and vocals), Shannon Whitworth (guitar, clawhammer and vocals), Billy Cardine (dobro and banjo) and Dan Bletz (acoustic guitar). The Biscuit Burners quickly established themselves. Along with being showcased at the IBMA Conference and appearing at the Historic Ryman Auditorium with Vassar Clements and Rhonda Vincent, they had their debut album, 'Fiery Mountain Music', chosen in the Top 10 Bluegrass Albums of 2004 by the Chicago Tribune. Critics also chose Shannon Whitworth's song \\"Come On Darlin'\\" as the IPOD Hotpick Bluegrass Song of 2004. In September 2005, the band released their second album, A Mountain Apart, which was in the Top 20 of the Roots Music Report National Bluegrass Airplay chart for five months after its release. In 2006, The Biscuit Burners could be enjoyed across the airwaves of BBC World TV’s Destination Music, NPR’ s Mountain Stage, and PBS’ Roadtrip Nation as well as in person at over 130 concerts nationwide including: Chicago’s Old Town School of Folk Music, Berkeley’s Freight and Salvage, Alexandria, VA’s Birchmere. Shannon Whitworth left the group to pursue a solo career. In 2007, Odessa Jorgensen joined the band on fiddle and vocals and contributed her talents to the 3rd album. The band's last show was in the fall of 2009 at the Kennedy Center as part of their Tribute to American Acoustic Music. Performance The Biscuit Burners have appeared on BBC World's \\"Destination Music\\", National Public Radio's \\"Mountain Stage\\", XM's \\"Bluegrass Junction\\", and PBS' \\"Roadtrip Nation\\". The group performed at Bonnaroo in 2007. Billy Cardine has performed with the three-time Grammy Winning Edgar Meyer at Carnegie Hall. The group has had a number of sellout concerts from Pennsylvania to California, and top bill appearances at major festivals. They've appeared in over 130 concerts nationwide including: MerleFest and the Bonnaroo Music Festival. The latter was depicted on The History Channel's \\"Our Generation\\". Musical style A fresh approach to acoustic music with roots that date as far back as mountain music can reach, The Biscuit Burners offer their Fiery Mountain Music with innovative instrumentation, resplendent harmonies, and captivating original material. Their unique yet familiar material pulls strong from their respect of traditional mountain music, their love of bluegrass and classic country, and their appreciation of music from the far corners of the world. Instruction In early 2004 they began an Appalachian Roots Music Schools Program, where they present the heritage of mountain music along with its techniques and etiquette. The program is designed to give school children a sense of the history and tradition of American bluegrass music.

A standard facebuster, also known as a jumping facebuster, involves the wrestler grabbing hold of the opponent's head/hair and dropping down to their knees, forcing the opponent's face into the mat. Variants =Argentine facebuster= The attacking wrestler places an opponent in an Argentine backbreaker rack, where the opponent is held face-up across both the shoulders of the wrestler. From here the wrestler falls sideways (towards the side where the opponent's head is held) while still holding the opponent's head with one arm and flipping the opponent's legs over with the other, driving them down to the mat face-first. WWE wrestler Bianca Belair uses this moves and calls it K.O.D (Kiss Of Death). Former WWE wrestler Tyler Reks used the move as the Burning Hammer (not be confused with the variation innovated by Kenta Kobashi) on rare occasions. =Belly-to-back inverted mat slam= Styles Clash on Matt Hardy. Styles performing the Styles Clash on Matt Hardy. From a position in which the opponent is bent forward against the wrestler's midsection, the wrestler grabs around the opponent's midsection and lifts so that the opponent is held upside down, facing in the same direction as the wrestler. The wrestler then hooks both arms of the opponent using their legs and falls forward, planting the opponent's body into the mat face-first. The move often sees the wrestler keep their legs hooked under the arms of the opponent after hitting the move, using the underhooking technique to turn the opponent on to their back into a Rana style pinning position. This move was innovated by Col. DeBeers and was made famous by A.J. Styles, who refers to the move as the Styles Clash. Styles performs the maneuver with a variation, as seen in the photos to the right: he does not hook the opponent's arms before performing the slam, but takes two steps and moves his legs in front of the opponent's arms, enabling him to use his legs to cover the shoulders for a pin. This variant is later utilized by former WWE Diva Michelle McCool, who referred to the move as the Faith Breaker. Cesaro uses a variation called the Neutralizer where he grapevines the opponent's leg with his arm similar to a cradle piledriver. =Belly-to-back facebuster= Like a belly-to-back suplex, the attacking wrestler wraps their arms around the opponent in a waistlock, lifts the opponent in the air, and falls forward into a facebuster. Brooke Tessmacher used this as her finisher and called it the Tess-Shocker.  Swinging belly-to-back facebuster  The opponent is lifted in sidewinder suplex position before being swung around and driven face first into the mat by the attacker. =Diving facebuster= This variation sees the wrestler grab a hold over the opponent's head/hair, then climb to the second rope or and finally jump from there dropping to their knees or in a sitout position and planting the opponent face first to the mat. In another variation the wrestler could just jump from the turnbuckle grabbing the opponent's head/hair in the air and planting them to the mat. =Double underhook facebuster= The wrestler bends their opponent forward, placing the opponent's head between the wrestler's legs, and then applies a double underhook on the opponent. The wrestler performs a kneeling or sitout facebuster. It is perhaps better known as a Pedigree, the name Triple H gave to the kneeling version of the move as his finisher. Chyna later adopted the move from Triple H and began using it as a finisher. Another similar version of the Pedigree was used by Seth Rollins, where he would release his opponent during the fall, while a sitout version, known as In Yo' Face, is the name Velvet Sky gave to the move as her finisher. Inverted double underhook facebuster The wrestler stands behind and facing the same way as their opponent and hooks both their arms. The wrestler then places their head next to the opponent's back and turns 180 degrees while twisting one of the opponent's arms over both of their heads. With the wrestler now in front of the opponent and still hooking the opponent's arms, the wrestler drops onto their back, driving the opponent down face-first into the mat. Innovated by Tommy Rogers as the Tomikaze, it was popularized by Christian, who used this move as a finisher in WWE/TNA; it is perhaps better known as the Killswitch, but he has previously called it the Impaler (1998–1999) and the Unprettier (1999–2009). Juice Robinson uses a jumping variation, calling it Pulp Friction. Candice Michelle used this move and called it Candywrapper. Chelsea Green uses the move as her finisher, calling it the I'm Prettier . Lio Rush uses a variation where he and the opponent spin a full 360°. Tyler Breeze is also among notable wrestlers who use the move and he refers to it as The Unprettier. Lifting double underhook facebuster Innovated by Gran Apache, this facebuster is performed when a wrestler bends an opponent forward, placing the opponent's head between the wrestler's legs (a standing head scissors), and hooks each of the opponent's arms behind their back. The wrestler then pulls back on the opponent's arms, lifting them up so that the opponent is held upside-down facing in the same direction as the wrestler, as if the wrestler was preparing for a double underhook piledriver. The wrestler then falls forward to a kneeling position, planting the opponent's body into the mat face-first. A sit-out variation of this move exists. This maneuver was popularized by Christopher Daniels, who uses a spinning sit-out version of the move and calls it the Angel's Wings. Awesome Kong uses a kneeling version as her finisher, known as the Implant Buster. Tommaso Ciampa uses this move, calling it Fairy Tale Ending, while Mandy Rose currently uses a sitout version of the move, known as the Bed of Roses. =Electric chair facebuster= The wrestler approaches the opponent from behind, and lifts them onto their shoulders into a seated position, the electric chair. The wrestler then lifts the opponent up by their thighs and pushes them forward and down, slamming them down to the mat chest first. The wrestler may also sit down while slamming the opponent. Used by Rhea Ripley as transition move. =Fireman's carry facebuster= This facebuster variation sees a wrestler lift an opponent up in a fireman's carry across their shoulders, then throw the opponent's legs out in front of them to spin them out, while simultaneously falling backwards or forwards, causing the opponent to land on their face and upper body. Popularized by Brock Lesnar as the F-5. =Front facelock drop= The wrestler applies a front facelock to the opponent and then throws their legs out behind them, falling onto their stomach and driving the opponent's face into the mat. It is similar to a standard DDT, except it targets the face of the victim rather than the head, and the wrestler falls onto their stomach instead of falling back as they would in a DDT. A single underhook variation was used by Seth Rollins. =Full nelson facebuster= The attacking wrestler stands behind, slightly to one side of and facing the opponent before reaching under the opponent's arms with their own corresponding arms and places the palms of their hands on the neck of the opponent, thereby forcing the opponent's arms up into the air (as in a full nelson hold). The attacking wrestler next hooks the opponent's near leg and throws themselves forwards, driving the opponent face-first into the ground. =Gory bomb= This back-to-back release facebuster is a variation of the Gory special where a wrestler releases the arms of the opponent to take hold of the opponent's legs while dropping to a seated position, forcing the opponent to fall forward and impact the mat face-first. The move is named after the innovator of the original Gory special, Gory Guerrero. WWE wrestler Kay Lee Ray uses this move.Shingo Takagi uses it as Noshigarami. =Inverted double leg slam= Also known as an inverted Alabama Slam, this move usually starts with the opponent sitting on an elevated position such as the top turnbuckle, with the attacking wrestler, standing in front of them and facing the same direction, positioning the opponent's legs over their shoulders. Then the attacking wrestler detaches from the turnbuckle, so that the opponent is held upside down in a back-to-back position. From this position the attacking wrestler bends over, flipping the opponent over their head and slamming them down to the mat face-first. The attacking wrestler may also sit down while slamming the opponent. Drew McIntyre currently uses this moves as a transitional move. =Inverted swinging facebuster= This version of a facebuster sees the wrestler place an opponent in an inverted facelock while holding the facelock, twisting them into the facebuster and landing with their legs spread apart, driving the opponent's face into the mat. Velvet Sky used a variation of this move. She begins with her opponent in an inverted facelock, then grabs one of the opponents arms and pulls, rotating the opponent so that the front of the body faces the mat and is in between her legs, finally driving down to the mat and ending in a facebuster. =Kneeling facebuster= The wrestler grabs the opponent by the head or hair and jumps in the air, landing in a kneeling position and driving the opponent's face into the mat. A slight variation of the kneeling facebuster sees a wrestler fall into the kneeling position while having the opponent's head between their legs and pushing the opponent down with their hands. =Over the shoulder facebuster= Also known as a powerslam facebuster, this variation sees the wrestler lifting the opponent onto their shoulders as in a front powerslam. Then as the opponent is on the shoulder, the wrestler jumps and slams the opponent face- first to the mat. A cutter variation also exists. WWE wrestler Big E uses this move as a finisher, calling it the Big Ending. =Ura-Shouten= The Wrestler lifts their Opponents into a Gutwrench Canadian backbreaker Rack and transisions it into a Swinging side Slam facebuster. Innovated and popularized by Hirooki Goto. =Powerbomb facebuster= This variation of the facebuster sees the wrestler seating the opponent over their own shoulders, as in a powerbomb. From this point, the wrestler pushes the opponent off their shoulders, grabs the opponent's head with both hands, and drops seated or kneeled to hit a sitout or kneeling facebuster. =Push-up facebuster= A variation where a wrestler puts the opponent's between their legs as they performs push-ups, causing the opponent's face to be slammed into the canvas a number of times. Often instead of straight push ups, the attacking wrestler just bounces their legs up and down to create the effect. Madison Rayne uses this as one of her signature moves. =Reverse chokeslam facebuster= The attacking wrestler grabs hold of an opponent's neck with both hands, one on the front, and one on the back. The arm that has the hand on the back of the neck may hook the opponent's arm. The wrestler then lifts the opponent up, releases the hand holding the front of the opponent's neck, and pushes forward to slam the opponent to the mat face-first with the other hand. Braun Strowman rarely uses this move as his finisher. A wrestler pushes their opponent upward by reaching under their legs and lifting them into the air. While retaining the hold on the opponent's leg, the wrestler falls backwards, dropping the opponent front-first into the canvas. It is commonly used when an opponent is charging. The move is similar to a back body drop, but the wrestler pushes upwards so that their opponent falls on to their face instead of falling back- first. =Shoulder facebuster= Also known as a hangman's facebuster or cravate facebuster, this facebuster is performed when an attacking wrestler, who is standing in a back-to-back position with an opponent, reaches back to pull the opponent's head over their shoulder before (while keeping a hold of the opponent's head) falling forwards to twist the opponent's head over so they slam face first into the mat. This move was the finisher of Curtis Axel, which he called the Axehole. =Sitout facebuster= Jillian Hall performing Solo (sitout facebuster) on Xandra Bale. Also known as the X-Factor. This is the most common variation of the standard facebuster in which the attacker grabs hold of the opponent by their head then jumps in the air, lifting the opponent and landing with their legs spread apart, driving the opponent's face into the mat. Another variation of this move is to grab the opponent by the hair, perform the same jump and landing but lift only the opponent's head, giving a harder effect when the opponent's face is driven into the mat. This move was popularized by Sean Waltman and The Bella Twins. =Spinning facebuster= Also known as a tornado facebuster, this variation sees the attacker grabbing hold of the opponent by their hair and then spinning in the air, landing in a kneeling position and driving the opponent's face into the mat. This maneuver was popularized by Melina. =Vertical suplex facebuster= Also called a front suplex or a gourdbuster, this move sees attacker apply a front facelock to the opponent and drape the opponent's near arm over their shoulder. The attacker lifts the opponent into a vertical position, then falls forward, driving the opponent's face into the ground. =Wheelbarrow facebuster= This facebuster sees the attacking wrestler grab a standing opponent around the waist from behind and lift them into a backdrop position before then falling to a sitting position, swinging the opponent down so that their face is driven into the ground. A variant, sees the wrestler lift the opponent's legs around their waist before placing both hands around the opponent's waist and lifting them into a wheelbarrow position. The wrestler then elevates their opponent into the air before performing a seated drop, driving their opponent's face into the canvas. Belly-to-back wheelbarrow facebuster A variation to the wheelbarrow facebuster which sees the attacking wrestler stand at the side of an opponent and begin to lift them as for a belly-to-back suplex. Instead of falling backwards to drop the opponent back-first, the wrestler stops after lifting the opponent, grabs a hold of their legs while still holding the opponent up, and slams them face-first on to the mat. Jushin Thunder Liger is well known for using this move as a finisher, calling it the Crash Thunder Buster. Hook and Ladder Beth Phoenix performing Glam Slam on Eve Torres. The wrestler hooks both an opponent's arms in an elevated double chickenwing, lifts them up into the air from behind, then drops the opponent down onto the mat face first. There is also a sitout variation, where a wrestler hooks their opponent's legs and drops to a seated position, while planting the opponent's face into the canvas between the wrestler's legs. Popularized by Beth Phoenix, who used this as her finisher, the Glam Slam.

His drawings of theater, opera, ballet and film celebrities appeared in Variety, Backstage, The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, The Boston Globe and many other publications. Norkin learned composition and anatomy from the muralist Mordi Gassner. He received a scholarship to the Metropolitan Art School after his high school graduation, and he later attended Cooper Union, the Brooklyn Museum Art School and the School of Fine and Industrial Art. During the 1940s, newspaper editors wanted to devote more space to new theatrical productions, but photo opportunities usually did not happen until a show opened. Norkin took advantage of the situation and gained access to rehearsals, performers, costume sketches, fittings and scenic designs, providing editors with illustrations prior to an opening.Broadway Theatre Newsletter: Sam Norkin From 1940 to 1956, his theatrical illustrations were a regular feature in the New York Herald Tribune. Then for the next 26 years, he covered the performing arts for the Daily News. Since 1940, Norkin has had more than 4000 drawings published. When he began doing theatrical caricature, he supplied his own captions, which eventually prompted him to write articles and reviews. He was an art critic for the Carnegie Hall house program and a cultural reporter for the Daily News. Books Norkin's theater reminiscences and 266 drawings came together in the book Sam Norkin, Drawings, Stories (Heinemann, 1994), which was reviewed by David Barbour: :A Norkin caricature is often densely packed with detail and may feature a great deal of solid black space. He also is more daring in his drafting; many of his pieces, in particular one from the Broadway production of The Phantom of the Opera, feature steeply raked lines which plunge vertiginously from top to bottom, to highly dramatic effect. On the other hand, many of Norkin's effects border on the surreal. His version of Michael Jeter and Jane Krakowski in Grand Hotel depicts the pair as a series of interrlated curves; Jeter, in particular, looks like a machine that you crank up and let loose on stage. His version of Constance Cummings as a stroke victim in Wings, uses cruelly sharp angles to create a Cubist deconstruction of the actress's face and limbs, which mirrors the disintegration of the character's mental functions. Norkin offers a wide-ranging collection of his works... He also showscases actors at different points in their careers (as in a trio of portraits of John Gielgud and Ralph Richardson) and different takes on different productions (he gives us a number of Salomes from the Metropolitan and New York City Operas).Barbour, David. Access My Library, 1995. Exhibitions Artwork by Norkin has been exhibited in the Lincoln Center Library and Museum of the Performing Arts, the Museum of the City of New York, the Metropolitan Opera House, the Hudson River Museum in (Yonkers, New York) and various galleries.

The Ministry of Justice operates other prisons. 261x261px Political prisoners have been incarcerated in Qincheng, among them participants in the Chinese democracy movement and Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. Famous former inmates include Li Rui, Jiang Qing,Kristof, Nicholas D. \\"Suicide of Jiang Qing, Mao's Widow, Is Reported.\\" The New York Times. June 5, 1991. Retrieved on April 12, 2012. Yuan Geng, Bao Tong, Dai Qing, as well as Tibetan figures such as the 10th Panchen Lama Choekyi Gyaltsen, and Phuntsok Wangyal. Other inmates included many communist cadres who struggled during the Cultural Revolution, such as Bo Yibo, Peng Zhen, Liu Xiaobo, Israel Epstein, Sidney Rittenberg and David Crook. More recently, high-ranking officials accused of corruption such as Chen Xitong, Chen Liangyu, and Bo Xilai were also imprisoned here. The prison is located at the eastern foothill of Yanshan, facing the North China Plain in the east, north and south. The plain is where Qincheng Farm () is located, which is part of the prison. Origin The prison was originally built to house Kuomintang (Nationalist) war criminals, but due to secrecy, the name was not publicized. Instead, it was simply referred as project #156, since it was number 156 out of 157 projects that China established with Soviet assistance. The head of Beijing Bureau of Public Security, Feng Jiping () was in charge of construction of the prison. Ironically, during the Cultural Revolution he was among the first to be jailed there. He was also one of the last to get out among those who were sent to the prison with him. In 1958, high-ranking former Nationalists classified as war criminals by the communists were sent to Qincheng Farm to work, and they had observed the prison in construction. Prisoners were curious because the thick wall and electric fence and asked the guards what building it would be, and the answer was: \\"Sport Academy.\\" When prisoners questioned why an advanced educational institution such as a sport academy would have such heavy security measures, they were told that it was an advanced sport academy, and everything was learned from the Soviet Union. Structure The prison is built in accordance with the 1954 Reform Through Labor Regulations, so it is divided into three sections. The first section is for jail houses, and it includes both the jail houses for low-ranking prisoners and that of high-ranking prisoners, with the ranking often decided by the prisoner's social status, job position, and level of crime before entering the prisons. The second is called the Management and Work Section, the largest one among all three, with Qincheng Farm for field labors. The last section is the residential section for employees such as wardens and their relatives. The prison is sandwiched between orchards, with farm land and fish pond in front, an exact reflection of Mao Zedong's claim in October, 1960: \\"our prisons are different than prisons in the past - each prison is actually a school, but also a factory or a farm.\\" Mao had further enhanced this on April 24, 1964 in his reaction to a case by claiming that \\"People can be reformed, if the correct policy and methods are adopted.\\" This characteristic also applies to most Chinese prisons, and Chinese have called this prison system as: \\"Special militarized organization, special enterprise, and special school.\\" Cells The original prison include four three-story brick buildings with sloped roof, each is named after celestial stems instead of numbers or alphabets: Jia (), Yi (), Bing (), Ding (). The area in front of each building is fenced with brick wall for prisoners to exercise, forming its own independent yard. Each exercise yard is divided into two sections evenly by a wall in the middle, on top of which guard patrolled, and would watch both sections. Each floor of the building is divided into many halls, on one side of the hall, there is a wall, opposite to the wall is where the cells are located, each individually locked with a padlock. There are at least 10 cells in each hall. The area of each cell is around 20 square meters. The wooden door of each cell is sandwiched between two iron plates, and there are two peepholes: one at the level of the toilet, while the other is above it. Around a foot from the ground, there is a rectangular window for delivering meals. The only furniture inside each cell is a bed that was around a foot from the ground and when a prisoner needs to write a confession or other materials, a desk similar to those in elementary schools would be provided. However, there would never be any chairs and prisoners must sit on the bed to write. For safety and security reasons, every sharp edge inside the cell has been changed to smooth/round shape. There are also special suicide watch cells with walls made of rubber so prisoners could not commit suicide by running into the walls. There is a window for each cell designed for lower-ranking prisoners. The area of the window is around one square meter, located more than two meters above the ground. The windowsill is sloped upward with window opens upward toward outside, but of course, prisoners are unable to open the window themselves. There are three layers for every window: screen, iron fence, and glass painted white. In the cells for high-ranking prisoners, there are two windows but the outermost layer is sanded glass instead of glass painted white. Prisoners could neither see the courtyard nor any other buildings, but some could see the mountain and sun from their cells. A 15-watt light bulb with sanded glass is on the ceiling, and it is covered by iron mesh, and the dim light is controlled by guards via a switch outside. In 1967, six more buildings were added, also named after celestial stem, continuing as Wu (), Ji (), Geng (), Xin (), Ren (), Gui (). The new jail houses is built of concrete and contain much more cells because the new cells are much smaller in comparison to those in the blocks built in 1958: the area of each cell is only 5 to 10 square metres. The toilet in these new cells could not be sit on, but instead, prisoners must squatting down when using the toilet and must carry water from wash sink to flush the toilet. There are two doors for each cells built in 1967: the outer one is an iron door and the inside one is a wooden door. Other features of the blocks built in 1967 are similar to those built in 1958.  Entrance  There are three gates at Qincheng Prison, the first gate has the heaviest guards presence. With the exception of prison staff and their relatives, all other people who are not prisoners entering the compound must have the permission slip from the 13th Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China. For prisoners, they would be first led to a small one-story building, where they would leave behind most of their belongings deemed to be unsuitable to be carried into cells, including shoelaces. The prisoners would then be given black prison uniforms and issued utensils, and personal hygiene materials. With the exception of a large enamel mug for water, everything else is plastic.  Names  Once a prisoner enters the prison, his or her original name is no longer used. Instead, the prisoners are referred by number. The number consists of two parts, with the first two digits indicating the year the prisoner was sent to Qincheng prison, while the remaining digits are the sequential number. For example, prisoner 6299 means that the prisoner was sent to the prison in 1962, while he or she was the 99th prisoner sent to Qincheng Prison that year. Prison employees are also prohibited from referring to each other by name, instead, they are called according to their job title, such as manager, warden, and director. However, their last names are sometimes allowed to be added before their job title when they are addressed.  Administration  Qincheng Prison has been under the administration of the 13th Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security most of the time since its establishment. Beginning in late October 1967, it came under the control of the People's Liberation Army which at this point had been put in charge of the 13th Bureau by the Central Cultural Revolution Group and Zhou Enlai. The \\"Military Control Commission of the 13th Bureau\\" administered the prison until April–June 1969 when the Bureau itself was abolished. The administration of Qincheng Prison now became the responsibility of a \\"Military Control Commission of Qincheng Prison\\" which reported to the Beijing municipal Bureau of Public Security Military Control Commission and not to the Ministry of Public Security. Thus formally \\"downgraded\\" in administrative terms, Qincheng was until the end of 1972 referred to in public documents as the Seventh Brigade of the Military Commission of the Beijing Bureau of Public Security. The Ministry of Public Security reasserted control over the prison in early 1973, after a decision to this effect had been taken by Premier Zhou Enlai on 8 January of that year. During the reform in the 1980s, the combined judicial and executive roles of the Ministry of Public Security is separated and the Ministry of Public Security only retained its executive role. In June, 1983, the administration of prisons was transferred to the Ministry of Justice, but due to the special need, the Ministry of Public Security still retained several prisons under its administration and Qincheng Prison was one of them, still under the administration of the 13th Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security. Originally designed to house Nationalist war criminals classified by the Communists, this category of prisoners no longer existed when the last batch were released in 1975. The largest category of prisoners is in fact, coming from within Communist ranks, like former cadres. The largest increase of prisoners occurred during Cultural Revolution, with extra buildings had to be built.  Management  The prison employees are divided into two categories and are strictly separated. The first category is the interrogation / investigation team, which is only responsible for investigate the prisoners' cases, and they are strictly forbidden to venture into prisoners' cells or any other premises other than the interrogation room. The other category is responsible for guarding the prisoners and taking care of their daily lives. Unlike those belonged to the first category, those in the second category could not even know the names of prisoners who are only allowed to be called by their numbers. Prison employees of both categories are strictly forbidden to make any personal connections to the prisoners, such as that they cannot reveal their names to the prisoners, cannot answer any of the prisoners' questions without authorization, and cannot ask any prisoners questions without authorization.  Interrogation  Prisoners are notified by a warden before the interrogation, and the warden would let the prisoner out of his or her cell, and lead the prisoner to the interrogation room. After the prisoner is seated in the interrogation room, the warden would withdraw and wait outside. Based on the experience of former prisoners, there are two type of interrogation rooms. Most prisoners are interrogated in the interrogation room with a stool inside where the prisoner sits, and facing the prisoner, there was a semicircle shaped platform. On top of the platform, there are several tables next to each other covered with white table cloth. Interrogators and recorders sit behind the tables at the opposite ends. Dai Qing, a famous Chinese human rights activist jailed at Qincheng Prison recalls that there is another type of interrogation room in which the stool is replaced by a chair and there is carpet on the floor. Additionally, there is air conditioning in the room. During the Cultural Revolution, before the interrogation had begun, everyone in the room had to read some quotes from Mao's Little Red Book loudly, and these quotes are also posted on the wall. Meals Prisoners receive different meals based on their ages, crimes committed, social status and job positions prior entering the prison. The monthly food budget for each high-ranking prisoner had always been nearly twice of the monthly salary of most ordinary factory workers in China until the 1970s, which was 60 renminbi. This was increased to more than 120 yuan in the 1990s. However, the monthly food budget for each low-ranking prisoner was only above 30 yuan in the 1990s. Three meals were provided on each day, Monday through Saturday. On Sundays and holidays, only two meals are provided. Each prisoner would receive boiled water for three times daily, one full cup each time, and a large cup given to each prisoner for this purpose. Low-ranking prisoners keep utensils themselves, and meals are delivered through the rectangular opening on the door about above the ground. Breakfast consists of steamed corn flour bread and a piece of salted vegetable, while lunch and dinner consists of rice, noodle, and other grains. A vegetarian dish cooked with vegetables and a bowl of thin soup is also served with lunch and dinner. High-ranking prisoners need not to keep utensils themselves and meals are served by opening the doors. Two vegetarian dishes and a dish with meat or fish, and bowl of thick soup are standard. Limited amount of milk and fruits are provided once weekly, and with special permission, some high-ranking prisoner can have better meal that is often given to prisoners that are about to be released. Shower Depending on the ranking of the prisoner, every prisoner is allowed to take a half an hour long shower once either weekly or monthly, under the surveillance of the same gender warden outside the door. According to the 1954 Reform Through Labor Regulations of the People's Republic of China, female prisoners are supposed to be watched by female wardens but there were rarely any female wardens nor female prisoners at Qincheng prison. The first significant presence of female prisoners appeared during Cultural Revolution, but by that era, the shower privilege granted to the prisoners were abolished like most other rights, and there were prisoners arrested at the beginning of Cultural Revolution who had not taken a shower for around a decade after they were jailed. Exercise Prisoners cannot earn the right to exercise immediately after entering the prison; they are only given the right later on. The frequency of exercise permitted for each prisoner may vary from once a day, to once a week. Officially, these prisoners are allowed to walk and exercise in the courtyards for a minimum of 20 minutes and a maximum of an hour. The actual times vary depending on the weather, the number of prisoners, and other factors. Because of the special status of prisoners in Qincheng Prison, each prisoner is only allowed to exercise alone. Prisoners cannot see any other prisoners due to the high walls, and they are not allowed to see any other prisoners while they are in the jail house. If two prisoners are released from their cells to exercise and they meet each other, one is ordered to back to his or her cell to wait until the other prisoner is gone. During prolonged solitary confinement during the Cultural Revolution, calcium deficiencies would result from the lack of exposure to sunlight. Many prisoners would lose their hair and teeth, and developed many other health problems. Prisoners jailed during the Cultural Revolution often had permanent disabilities after their release. Sleep Following the strict former-Soviet Union practice, prisoners also had strict rules until the early 1980s when they sleep: they must keep their hands above their sheets and they must face the peephole. Light will never be out when prisoners are asleep, because guards needs to check on prisoners. Prisoners are awoken by whistles at 7:00 in the morning sharp, and they go to bed at 21:00 sharp upon hearing whistles. Originally, high-ranking prisoners have military style bed sheets, but low-ranking prisoners have to sleep on top of straws on their beds. If the prisoner have vanished from the guards' view, the wardens would immediately be notified to go into the cell to check what is going on. Reading The regular reading material in the jail is People's Daily. Other reading materials includes publications in China provided to prisoners by the visiting relatives of prisoners. There is a prison library that only high-ranking prisoners were allowed to use. Most reading materials were originally donated by the former Nationalists classified as war criminals by the Communists, and consist mostly of works by Mao Zedong, Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, and Joseph Stalin. The other source of donation is from the prisoners' relatives and reading materials donated by released prisoners. All reading materials are screened and those deemed improper for the prisoners are rejected. However, the censorship varies according to the political situation in China. For example, after the death of Lin Biao, copies of Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong (Little Red Book) were confiscated and pages with Lin Biao's words were removed. Even during the era without any political turmoil, it is worth noting that many publications legally publicized in China and available to the general public would not be permitted for prisoners. Visitation Visitation is conducted in a special visitation room, which is a room separated into two sections by a wall. A small window is on the wall for the communication between the prisoners and their relatives. Wardens can be either watch the visitation from another room immediately adjacent to the visitation room, or can be directly behind the prisoner. Anything brought into the prison by the prisoners' relatives must be screened and registered on a check sheet and those deemed unsuitable must be brought back immediately after the visitation is over. After visitation, there must be the signature of prison warden on the visitation permission slip for the relatives to leave the prison. Labour Prisoners at Qincheng Prison are tasked with manual labour instead of being executed in accordance with Mao Zedong's order given in 1957 in one of his speeches, in which Mao explained why political prisoners must not be executed: *1st: If one was executed, then more would have to be executed for the same crime later on for equality, and it would difficult to spare the lives of future prisoners who committed the same crime, because justice system would be criticized as unequal, giving preferential treatments *2nd: Wrong people and even innocent people might be executed by mistake *3rd: Executing prisoners could mean the vanishing of evidence *4th: When prisoners were executed, it could not increase production output, could not improve scientific research, could not strengthen national defense, and could not liberate Taiwan *5th: You (the Communist regime) would be accused of excessive killings Reactionaries are evil but once captured, they could be turned to something useful for the people. As result of this speech of Mao, prisoners at Qincheng Prison are put to work instead of being executed, and they are subjected to be assigned to tasks other than that of the Qincheng Prison to help out outside the prison. Heavy manual labor was performed only by the nationalist war criminals classified by the communists, but since the release of the last group of these prisoners in 1975, there are no longer any such duties. However, light manual labors continues such as making straw hats and making boxes for matches. Jiang Qing requested and was permitted to make dolls. This light manual labor is often conducted in their own cells. Abuse Though physical and verbal abuse of prisoners are strictly forbidden, such regulations were completely ignored during Cultural Revolution, during which many prisoners had died as result of abuse and torture. Abuses disguised as punishment commonly occurred during Cultural Revolution included forcing prisoners to stand for a prolonged period of time and not providing prisoners with enough water. Wei Jingsheng had published under his name in March 1979 an essay denouncing the inhumane conditions of the Chinese Qincheng Prison where was imprisoned the 10th Panchen Lama and that drove the latter to a suicide attempt.Excerpts from Qincheng: A Twentieth Century Bastille, published in Exploration, March 1979 It is clear that a major part of the essay of Wei was written by other anonymous authors with real information about Qincheng.DARING TO VOICE THE UNSPOKEN Health care There is a medical clinic at the Qincheng Prison with both doctors and nurses assigned. There is also a dental clinic, built of brick and stone, located further away from the main prison buildings. In addition to treating prisoners for ordinary illness, semi-annual physical checks are also performed. High-ranking prisoners could receive more frequent checks depending on their health conditions. Both the high-ranking and low- ranking prisoners receive better health care than ordinary citizens outside, and this situation has not changed since the first day when the prison was established. For important high-ranking prisoners, the doctors at Qincheng Prison do not have the final decision-making authority on how to treat the prisoners for their illness. It is often a political decision determined by the top brass of the communist regime. For example, in the autumn of 1969 during Cultural Revolution, under Kang Sheng's order, an important high- ranking prisoner, Shi Zhe (), the former personal secretary and personal Russian translator of Mao Zedong was jailed in Qincheng prison. He was scheduled to have an operation to remove a so-called cancer. However, doctors determined that there was no cancer at all, but Kang Sheng insisted on giving Shi Zhe () an operation, and the completely unnecessary operation was carried out to fulfill the political task. Hospital When prisoners are seriously ill and thus cannot be treated at the prison clinic, they are transferred to Fuxing (复兴, Revival) Hospital on the Fuxingmen Outer Street. Fuxing Hospital is one of the hospitals for Ministry of Public Security employees and their relatives. All Ministry of Public Security hospitals shoulder the additional responsibility of treating prisoners, but Fuxing Hospital is specially designated to treat prisoners from Qincheng Prison. The prison section is located on the 2nd Floor of one of the hospital buildings and it is completely segregated from the rest of the facility. Every room is about 10 square meters, with one or two hospital beds, a wash sink, and a toilet. The window is equipped with sanded glass so that nothing outside can be seen and there is another layer of iron fence outside the window glass. Guards watch the prisoners behind the door that is locked from outside. Prisoners treated at the hospital exercise by walking on the roof of the building. Like the doctors in the prison clinic, doctors at Fuxing Hospital also lacked the final decision-making authority on how to treat the important prisoners. For example, during the Cultural Revolution, former Minister of Public Security and the head of Mao Zedong's personal bodyguards, Senior General Luo Ruiqing () was jailed at Qincheng Prison. When he suffered a fracture to his left leg, he was first denied medical treatment, then subjected to an amputation which was to be the eventual cause of his death.

Water vapor is diffusing through the transparently shown cylinder. The yellow arrow symbolizes the diffusion direction. The two dark red square elements are two pairs of sensors each measuring relative humidity and temperature. Transepidermal water loss (TEWL or TWL) is the loss of water that passes from inside a body (animal or plant) through the epidermis (that is, either the epidermal layer of animal skin or the epidermal layer of plants) to the surrounding atmosphere via diffusion and evaporation processes. TEWL in mammals is also known as insensible water loss (IWL), as it is a process over which organisms have little physiologic control and of which they are usually mostly unaware. Insensible loss of body water can threaten fluid balance; in humans, substantial dehydration sometimes occurs before a person realizes what is happening. Measurements of TEWL may be useful for identifying skin damage caused by certain chemicals, physical insult (such as \\"tape stripping\\") or pathological conditions such as eczema, as rates of TEWL increase in proportion to the level of damage. However, TEWL is also affected by environmental factors such as humidity, temperature, the time of year (season variation) and the moisture content of the skin (hydration level). Therefore, care must be taken when interpreting the meaning of TEWL rates. Implications =Human health= From a clinical standpoint, TEWL measurements are of great importance in evaluating skin barrier functionality.Gioia, Francesco and Leonardo Celleno (2002) The dynamics of TWL from hydrated skin. Skin Research and Technology Vol. 8 pp. 178–186 Often normal rates of TEWL – from 2.3 g/m²/h to 44 g/m²/hJan Kottner, Andrea Lichterfeld, Ulrike Blume-Peytavi (2013) Transepidermal water loss in young and aged healthy humans: a systematic review and meta-analysis, Arch Dermatol Res Vol. 305 pp. 315–323, – are compromised due to injury, infection and/or severe damage as in the case of burns causing rates over 50 or even over 100 g/m²/h.K.L. Gardien, D.C. Baas, H.C. de Vet, E. Middelkoop (2016) Transepidermal water loss measured with the Tewameter TM300 in burn scars. Burns Vol. 42(7) pp. 1455-1462, Damage to the stratum corneum and superficial skin layers not only results in physical vulnerability, but also results in an excess rate of water loss. Therefore, dehydration, metabolic acidosis, and conditions such as anhydremia or concentration of the blood are often critical issues for healthcare providers to consider in the treatment of burn patients.Underhill, Frank P. (1927) The Significance of Anhydremia in Extensive Superficial Burns Journal of the American Medical Association Vol. 95 No. 12.Artz, Lieut. Col. Curtis P. and Capt. Harry S. Soroff (MC) (1955) Modern Concepts in the Treatment of Burns Journal of the American Medical Association Vol. 159 No. 5 TEWL is of major concern in public health, considering the relatively high rate of burn incidence among communities in the developing world due to poor quality cooking stoves.Ahuja, Rajeev B. and Sameek Bhattacharya (2004) Burns in the developing world and burn disasters British Medical Journal Vol. 329. Resources for burn care in local clinics are often scarce and depending on the affected surface area, TEWL is a major issue that can be overlooked. Furthermore, TEWL is also affected by variations in sweat gland activity, temperature, and metabolism.Chilcott, Robert et al. (2002) Transepidermal water loss does not correlate with skin barrier function in vitro The Journal of Investigative Dermatology Vol. 118 pp. 871–875 Therefore, transepidermal water loss becomes a significant factor in dehydration associated with several major disease states. =Botany and earth science= The amount of water that trees and other plants move from the ground to the atmosphere with TEWL is of interest in botany and earth science, as transpiration by plants is a substantial component of the water cycle on Earth. Acronym variation Web corpus searches show that the acronym TEWL is about 40 times more common than TWL in reference to transepidermal water loss. A large advantage of TEWL is that it has higher specificity to that sense than does TWL, which has more alternative senses, including, most importantly, two other senses having to do with evaporation of body water: thermal work limit (TWL), which is the highest sustainable metabolic rate that well-hydrated, acclimatized individuals can maintain in a specific thermal environment, and total water loss (TWL), which in its physiologic sense is a superset of transepidermal water loss, because it also includes respiratory losses and urinary losses. Use of the acronym TEWL for transepidermal water loss avoids this ambiguity. As with many other acronyms in biology and medicine (for example, polymorphonuclear [PMN], bronchioloalveolar carcinoma [BAC], dolutegravir [DTG]), there is no law preventing the letters of the acronym from representing combining forms (trans- + epidermal) or other syllables irrespective of word boundaries. For certain regions of human epidermis specific acronyms for TEWL are common. Water loss through finger and toe nails is called transonychial water loss, abbreviated TOWL.Krönauer C., Gfesser M., Ring J., Abeck D.: Transonychial water loss in healthy and diseased nails.

Design The simplest form of recoil buffer is made from a resilient and deformable material (leather, rubber, polymer e.g. a rubber butt pad on a shotgun). A second way of producing a recoil buffer is to insert a spring into the recoil train—the path/part(s) generating recoil impulse. This spring is mounted to the point(s) where the firearm contacts a mechanical holder such as a tripod or human upper torso. Reducing the initial jolt, the rate and/or extent of rearward displacement, and any internal impacts in the operating parts of a firearm can reduce the shooter's perception of recoil, and may also work to extend the life of the mechanism and its parts. More sophisticated designs use hydraulic or pneumatic shock absorbers; systems of springs, cams and levers to modify, dampen, or dissipate the rearward impulse generated as the projectile is fired down the bore of the firearm. Aftermarket buffers are often moulded bumpers or additional springs placed between operating metal parts which impact one another, such as the slide and the frame of a semi-automatic pistol. This type of buffer cushions the battering force of repeated metal on metal impact, reducing wear on parts and lengthening the service life of the firearm. Reduction of perceived recoil discomfort is an immediate added benefit of this type recoil buffer. Some pneumatic recoil buffers used in firearms are fast, low-power gas springs. When compressed, they present initial resistance as the rod-to-seal grip is broken and then they move in a regular manner. An additional small spring can be used inside the gas spring if rapid turnaround times are needed. Springs twist and the coils try to ride over each other when moving and this chaotic movement does not exist with gas springs, hence reducing twist and jump of the firearm. These features are very advantageous. Fine tuning of the spring power is also possible by altering the internal gas volume. This design for firearms was invented and patented by Collins and Shipman of Bedford, UK and Bergstrom in the U.S. in 2001. Controversy There is some debate as to whether or not buffers really reduce recoil, with some arguing they actually increase it and, in addition, cause malfunctions of the firearm. This debate mainly occurs with guns that weren't originally designed for recoil buffers, such as the M1911 and AK-47, but has also extended to designs the included them originally. The counter argument generally is that if the buffer is made out of proper materials it can absorb the recoil instead of transferring it and that most malfunctions are caused by cheap plastic buffers.

The idea for the film came from reality television shows such as Big Brother. The title refers to the guessing game I spy.  Plot  Five contestants, Matt (Sean Cw Johnson), Emma (Laura Regan), Charlie (Jennifer Sky), Danny (Stephen O'Reilly) and Rex (Kris Lemche), agree to take part in a reality webcast, where they must spend six months in a house to win $1 million. If anyone leaves, then no one wins the money. Nearing the end of the six months, tension between the contestants rises after Emma finds strange messages she believes are from a man from her past and the food packages arrive containing a letter that claims Danny's grandfather has died, and a gun with five bullets. One night, a man named Travis Patterson (Bradley Cooper) arrives, claiming he is lost in the woods and that his GPS has died. Despite claiming to be an internet programmer, he claims to not recognize any of the contestants or ever having heard of the show. Later that night, Travis has sex with Charlie, and then secretly talks directly into a camera, to communicate with whoever is watching them. The next morning, Travis leaves and Danny discovers his backpack outside covered in blood and shredded to pieces. The contestants assume he was attacked by an animal but Rex believes Travis works for the people running their show and that it is all a trick to make them leave the house and forfeit the prize money. Emma discovers her underwear among Danny’s belongings and confronts him, unaware that Travis planted them there the previous night. Danny denies it and attempts to make peace by giving her a crudely carved wooden cat, which Emma and Charlie ridicule, while Danny overhears. The next morning, the group finds Danny has committed suicide by hanging himself from the staircase balcony with a rope. The guests finally decide to leave, but after being unable to contact anyone via radio, decide to wait until the next morning. Rex uses the GPS unit from Travis' bag and his laptop to gain access to the internet to find out more about the show but is unable to find any evidence of their show online. Rex is only able to find a heavily encrypted beta site, that requires a $50,000 fee to access, and displays a web page with their pictures and betting odds. The group decides they will leave the next morning, though Rex and Emma go up to the roof to set off a flare. While Charlie and Matt remain in the house, Matt asks a camera if he should kill her, before suffocating her with a plastic bag. Later, while Emma is sleeping, Rex comes downstairs and is decapitated with an axe by Matt. Matt awakens Emma and brings her up to the attic, telling her he is being chased and the others are dead. He then makes advances on Emma, who refuses, and attempts to rape her, before she stabs him in the back and runs off. Emma runs outside and finds a police officer, who handcuffs her inside the car and enters the house. An injured Matt then crawls out, begging the cop to let him kill Emma, since he spent six months in the house with her. Realizing they are working together, Emma escapes the car and tries to run but is shot in the back with a rifle by the cop. Matt and the cop sit in the kitchen discussing the setup they created with Travis for their high paying clients who want to witness the murders. When the cop says there are always \\"five suckers\\" to play the game with, Matt corrects him to four, and is then shot in the head. The cop then leaves, talking to Travis over the radio, while Emma is seen locked in a small room, unable to escape. As she collapses screaming, the cameras filming all shut off, one by one.

The hardware, cheaply available, became popular among collectors who modified the appliance to run as a normal PC. This made the device capable of running PC operating systems, such as Linux and Microsoft Windows. The original retail price was $99, including a keyboard with integrated pointing device. The actual manufacturing cost was much higher, roughly estimated between $300 and $400. The devices were sold as a loss leader for monthly Internet service. However, as soon as a hacking method became available on the Internet (in 2000), many customers canceled the monthly service, which eventually made the business model unsustainable. Similar business models and failures were also seen with the contemporaneous 3Com Audrey and Virgin Webplayer. Specifications The i-Opener had a 10\\", 800×600 LCD display with stereo speakers, a 180 MHz IDT WinChip C6 Socket 7 CPU, a single SO-DIMM socket with a 32 MB module, and a 16 MB SanDisk flash module housing the QNX operating system. Connectivity was via single PS/2, USB, and parallel printer ports, as well as a 56k modem. Modding View of the SO-DIMM RAM module inside the i-Opener James Kmetz, a hacker from Indiana, discovered that the i-Opener was simply an x86 compatible PC inside a custom enclosure. When he removed the back cover of the device, he found an IDE connector, which allowed adding a hard drive and CD-ROM, thus making the device nothing less than a $99 PC with an LCD screen. However, the pins on the IDE connector were reversed, requiring the making or ordering of special cables and adapters to connect a hard drive to the unit. Subsequent attempts by Netpliance to thwart modding included gluing the BIOS chip into its socket with epoxy and modifying its settings (rendering it unable to detect hard drives), limiting the type of CPU one could use to that included with the unit, and even cutting the pins on the IDE connector.

It is located in the small village of Borg, near Bøstad, in the municipality of Vestvågøy. It is part of the Museum Nord consortium. History In 1983, archaeologists uncovered the Chieftain House at Borg (På Borg på Vestvågøya i Lofoten), a large Viking Era building believed to have been already established around the year 500 AD. A joint Scandinavian research project was conducted at Borg from 1986 until 1989. Excavations revealed the largest building ever to be found from the Viking period in Norway. The foundation of the Chieftain House at Borg measured long and high. The seat at Borg is estimated to have been abandoned around AD 950. Current operation Reconstructed long-house at Lofotr Viking Museum After the excavation ended, the remains of what had once been the long-house remained visible. The long-house has been reconstructed slightly to the north of the excavation site. In 1995, the Lofotr Viking Museum was opened. The museum includes a full reconstruction of the 83-metre (272 ft) long chieftain's house, a blacksmith's forge, two ships (replicas of the Gokstad ship, one in full scale size) and their boathouses, and various reenactments intended to immerse the visitor in life at the time of the Vikings. The main building was designed by Norwegian architect, Gisle Jakhelln. The administration of Lofotr Viking Museum is located in the former parsonage of the Borge Church. In September 2006, a planned enlargement of Lofotr, the building of a large amphitheater into the ground between the reception building and the Chieftain House, was postponed because of the archeological findings of some 2,000-year-old cooking sites and pole holes at the site. Today, the area is excavated and new buildings have been built on the site. This part of the museum comprises 2 permanent exhibition halls and a film theatre. The exhibition halls displays through videos and unique artifacts, the finding and excavation of Borg. Quite a few of the archeological artifacts are of remarkable character. The extensive museum outdoor area is tied together with gravel walking paths, inviting the visitors to explore the history in a greater content than the exhibition halls alone - to see the reconstructed Chieftain´s house on top of the hill, to go on board the Viking ship, to see the surrounding views and try to grasp the value of the landscape and what it offered in the Viking Age - it all adds to the experience. The museum is open every day from 1 May to 15 September. The administration of Lofotr Viking Museum is located in the former parsonage of the Borge Church. The Longhouse served as the pit stop of the fourth leg in the Amazing Race 23.

Description  Restoration of Velocisaurus, with head based on that of Masiakasaurus Velocisaurus was probably around long, based on a tibia length of . This makes it the smallest noasaurid. The foot is unique in that the middle (third) metatarsal has become the main weight-bearing element. Its upper end has thickened whereas the shafts of the adjoining second and fourth metatarsals have thinned considerably. Such a configuration is unknown for other theropods, including birds. Bonaparte explained it as an adaptation for a cursorial (running) lifestyle. The high speed would have been necessary to escape larger theropods; Bonaparte suggested that Velocisaurus was itself an omnivore, as indicated by the fact that the sole claw found, of the fourth toe, was not trenchant but relatively straight. Velocisaurus can be characterized by several traits unknown in other Abelisauroids. These include: * A subtriangular cross section of the femur, with the medial and lateral sides converging to form a thick crest pointing anteriorly (a subtriangular cross section of the femur is also known in Masiakasaurus). * A long and slender tibia with a large anteriorly flat distal end to accommodate a large ascending process of the astragalus (reminiscent of derived coelurosaurs and ornithomimids). * Very thin and rod-like metatarsals II and IV (metatarsal II is reduced to a lesser extent in other noasaurids and some abelisaurids as well). * An anteroposteriorly short and dorsoventrally tall subtriangular pedal phalanx IV-1, with a narrow dorsal surface.  History of discovery  In 1985 Oscar de Ferrariis and Zulma Brandoni de Gasparini uncovered fossils at Boca del Sapo in Neuquén province of Patagonia from layers of the Bajo de la Carpa Formation, dating from the Santonian. Among them was the right lower hind limb of a small theropod. In 1991 this dinosaur was described and named by José Bonaparte as Velocisaurus unicus. The generic name is derived from Latin velox, \\"swift\\", a reference to the fact that the hind leg and foot show adaptations for running. The specific name means \\"unique\\" in Latin, referring to the exceptional build of the foot. The genus and species are based on the holotype MUCPv 41, a nearly complete right leg which is part of the collection of the Museo de la Universidad Nacional del Comahue.Bonaparte J.F. (1991). \\"Los vertebrados fósiles de la Formación Rio Colorado, de la Ciudad de Neuquén y Cercanías, Cretácico Superior, Argentina\\" [The fossil vertebrates of the Rio Colorado Formation, of the city of Neuquén and surroundings, Upper Cretaceous, Argentina].

Classification  Bonaparte originally assigned Velocisaurus to a family of its own, the Velocisauridae. A study of theropod relationships by Fernando Novas and Sebastian Apesteguia in 2003 showed that Velocisaurus was a close relative of the strange ceratosaur Masiakasaurus.

He dreams of finding a perfect woman that will love him for who he is, despite his father's insistence that he lower his standards. When two women from a tour ask Harold where they can see Hollywood stars, he directs them to a trendy Hollywood cafe where his best friend, Danny (Jeffrey D. Sams), is a bartender. Harold goes to meet them and overhears a conversation in which a man hits on a woman by telling her that he is a writer represented by Arthur Blake (Shawn). Harold then spots up-and-coming actress Amanda Clark (Fenn) arguing with her agent, Sidney Stone (Williams). Danny encourages Harold to ask Amanda for an autograph. She greets him warmly and asks what he does. He lies and tells her that he is a writer represented by Arthur Blake. Amanda asks for his feedback on a screenplay for a movie she is cast in. Danny encourages Harold to pursue Amanda romantically, even though she has a movie-star boyfriend, Rich Adams (Costas Mandylor). Harold meets with Amanda to discuss the script and is the only person who sees the same problems with the screenplay that she sees. Amanda takes Harold to a party filled with stars and elites so they can confront Sidney with Harold's opinion of the script. After Sidney dismisses them both, Amanda catches Rich with another woman. Rich and Sidney set out to stop Harold's budding relationship with Amanda before it embarrasses them both. Meanwhile, Harold's father decides to set him up with an \\"interesting-looking\\" psychic named Lulu (Yeardley Smith). After escaping from Lulu, Harold takes Amanda on a date to a local fair. At the end of their date, Amanda tells Harold that she's arranged for him to rewrite the screenplay, telling Harold that Sidney will call Arther Blake the next day to finalize the details and set the pay. Harold tries to tell Amanda the truth about himself, but can't bring himself to. The next morning, Harold sneaks into Arthur Blake's office and explains the whole situation. Arthur Blake advises Harold to \\"just write\\". Despite knowing nothing about writing, Harold buys a stack of books on screenwriting and dedicates himself to rewriting the screenplay. His father convinces him that the key to being a great writer is to be a great drinker, and encourages him to go find a bar and get drunk. Meanwhile, Amanda realizes she's falling for Harold and begins digging for information about him. Nobody knows anything about him. She calls the tour company looking for him. Harold's father answers, thinking he's talking to Lulu, and tells her to forget about Harold because he's only interested in Hollywood floozies. Amanda then finds Harold at the bar where they first met, drunk and surrounded by giggling women. She confronts Harold about his obsession with floozies and ends their relationship. He tries, again, to tell her the truth, but she drives away before he can finish explaining it. Dejected, Harold goes back home and finishes rewriting the script. Assuming that his screenwriting career is over before it began, Harold goes back to driving the tour bus. Harold's father finds out that Amanda accused him of being obsessed with floozies and realizes that he is the reason they broke up. He goes to Amanda's home to explain the mix-up and fix her relationship with Harold. While driving the tour bus, Harold sees Rich with a bouquet of flowers and realizes that he is on his way to see Amanda. Harold races with Rich to get to Amanda's house first so he can finally explain why he lied about being a writer. Harold arrives at Amanda's house and she tells him that his father already explained everything. She also tells him that she loved the script, except for one thing. She asks if he's ever been in love, because the hero in the movie doesn't respond like a man in love. Then they kiss, serenaded by applause by customers on the tour bus.

It is dated to the 2nd century BCE.  Overview  Patañjali is one of the three most famous Sanskrit grammarians of ancient India, other two being and Kātyāyana who preceded Patañjali (dated to c. 150 BCE). Kātyāyana's work (nearly 1500 vārtikas on ) is available only through references in Patañjali's work. It was with Patañjali that the Indian tradition of language scholarship reached its definite form. The system thus established is extremely detailed as to shiksha (phonology, including accent) and vyakarana (grammar and morphology). Syntax is scarcely touched, because syntax is not important in this highly inflexional language, but nirukta (etymology) is discussed, and these etymologies naturally lead to semantic explanations. People interpret his work to be a defense of , whose Sutras are elaborated meaningfully. Patañjali also examines Kātyāyana rather severely. But the main contributions of Patañjali lies in the treatment of the principles of grammar enunciated by him. Kātyāyana introduced semantic discourse into grammar, which was further elaborated by Patañjali to such an extent that ' can be called a mix of grammar as such as well as a philosophy of grammar. Kāśika-vritti by Jayāditya and Vāmana (mentioned by Itsing) included viewpoints of other grammarians also which did not conform to Patañjali's views.

They are traditionally seen as crustaceans, even if that position has been questioned.Treatise on Zoology - Anatomy, Taxonomy, Biology. The Crustacea, Volum 5 About 130 species of pentastomids are known; all are obligate parasites with correspondingly degenerate anatomy. Adult tongue worms vary from about in length, and parasitise the respiratory tracts of vertebrates. They have five anterior appendages. One is the mouth; the others are two pairs of hooks, which they use to attach to the host. This arrangement led to their scientific name, meaning \\"five openings\\", but although the appendages are similar in some species, only one is a mouth. Alternative names for the Pentastomida include Pentastoma (strictly a genus name), Linguatulida, and Acanthotheca. Biology Historically significant accounts of tongue worm biology and systematics include early work by Josef Aloys Frölich, Alexander von Humboldt, Karl Asmund Rudolphi, Karl Moriz Diesing and Rudolph Leuckart. Other important summaries have been published by Louis Westenra Sambon, Richard Heymons and John Riley, and a review of their evolutionary relationships with a bibliography up to 1969 was published by J. T. Self. =Anatomy= Pentastomids are worm-like animals ranging from in length. The anterior end of the body bears five protuberances, four of which are clawed legs, while the fifth bears the mouth. The body is segmented and covered in a chitinous cuticle. The digestive tract is simple and tubular, since the animal feeds entirely on blood, although the mouth is somewhat modified as a muscular pump. The nervous system is similar to that of other arthropods, including a ventral nerve cord with ganglia in each segment. Although the body contains a haemocoel, no circulatory, respiratory, or excretory organs are present. =Life cycle= Pentastomids live in the upper respiratory tract of reptiles, birds, and mammals, where they lay eggs. They are gonochoric (having two sexes), and employ internal fertilisation. The eggs are either coughed out by the host or leave the host body through the digestive system. The eggs are then ingested by an intermediate host, which is commonly either a fish or a small herbivorous mammal. The larva hatches in the intermediate host and breaks through the wall of the intestine. It then forms a cyst in the intermediate host's body. The larva is initially rounded in form, with four or six short legs, but moults several times to achieve the adult form. The pentastomid reaches the main host when the intermediate host is eaten by the main host, and crawls into the respiratory tract from the oesophagus. Human infestation Extraction of an Armillifer grandis nymph from a human eye Tongue worms occasionally parasitise humans. While a report exists of Sebekia inducing dermatitis,Correct spelling: Sebakia --> Sebekia, See the two genera responsible for most internal human infestation are Linguatula and Armillifer. Visceral pentastomiasis can be caused by Linguatula serrata, Armillifer armillatus, Armillifer moniliformis, Armillifer grandis, and Porocephalus crotali. The terms associated with infections can vary: * Linguatula disease can be called linguatuliasis or linguatulosis. * Porocephalus disease can be called porocephaliasis or porocephalosis. * Armillifer disease can also be called porocephalosis. (An alternate name for Armillifer moniliformis is Porocephalus moniliformis.) * \\"Pentastomiasis\\" can refer to any infection of Pentastomida. Porocephalus and Armillifer (which are all cylindrical and all inhabit snakes) have much more in common with each other than they do with Linguatula (which is flat and inhabits dogs and wolves). Affinities The affinities of tongue worms have long proved controversial. Historically, they were initially compared to various groups of parasitic worms. Once the arthropod-like nature of their cuticle was recognised, similarities were drawn with mites, particularly gall mites (Eriophyidae). Although gall mites are much smaller than tongue worms, they also have a long, segmented body and only two pairs of legs. Later work drew comparisons with millipedes and centipedes (Myriapoda), with velvet worms (Onychophora) and water bears (Tardigrada). Some authors interpreted tongue worms as essentially intermediate between annelids and arthropods, while others suggested that they deserved a phylum of their own. Tongue worms grow by moulting, which suggests they belong to Ecdysozoa, while other work has identified the arthropod-like nature of their larvae. In general, the two current alternative interpretations are: pentastomids are highly modified and parasitic crustaceans, probably related to fish lice, or they are an ancient group of stem-arthropods, close to the origins of Arthropoda. =Crustaceans= The possibility that tongue worms are crustaceans can be traced back to the work of Pierre-Joseph Van Beneden, who compared them to parasitic copepods. The modern form of this hypothesis dates from Karl Georg Wingstrand's study of sperm morphology, which recognised similarities in sperm structure between tongue worms and fish lice (Argulidae) – a group of maxillopod crustaceans which live as parasites on fish and occasionally amphibians. John Riley and colleagues also offered a detailed justification for the inclusion of the tongue worms among the crustaceans. The fish louse model received significant further support from the molecular work of Lawrence G. Abele and colleagues. A number of subsequent molecular phylogenies have corroborated these results, and the name Ichthyostraca has been proposed for a (Pentastomida + Branchiura) clade. Thus a number of important standard works and databases on crustaceans now include the pentastomids as members of this group. =Stem-arthropods= Critics of the Ichthyostraca hypothesis have pointed out that even parasitic crustaceans can still be recognised as crustaceans based on their larvae; but that tongue worms and their larvae do not express typical characters for Crustacea or even Euarthropoda. An alternative model notes the extremely ancient Cambrian origins of these animals and interprets tongue worms as stem-group arthropods. A recent morphological analysis recovered Pentastomida outside the arthropods, as sister group to a clade including nematodes, priapulids and similar ecdysozoan 'worm' groups. Adding fossils, they suggested an extinct animal called Facivermis could be closely related to tongue worms. However it should be stressed that these authors did not explicitly test pentastomid/crustacean relationships. Fossil record Exceptionally preserved, three-dimensional and phosphatised fossils from the Upper Cambrian Orsten of Sweden and the Cambrian/Ordovician boundary of Canada have been identified as pentastomids. Four fossil genera have been identified from the Cambrian so far: Aengapentastomum, Bockelericambria, Haffnericambria and Heymonsicambria. These fossils suggest that pentastomids evolved very early and raise questions about whether these animals were parasites at this time, and if so, on which hosts. Conodonts have sometimes been mentioned as possible hosts in this context. A fifth genus, Invavita, is from Silurian-aged marine strata of England: fossil specimens of Invavita are found firmly attached to their ostracod hosts of the species Nymphatelina gravida. It possessed a head, a worm-like body, and two pairs of limbs.

cartoonist and animator, primarily known for the comic strip Gordo, which ran from 1941 through 1985.  Biography  Gus Arriola in 1935 Gus Arriola was born in Florence, Arizona, the youngest of nine children. Arriola's father, Aquiles Arriola, had been born on a hacienda in Sonora, Mexico. Gus's mother died when he was a baby, and he was raised by an older sister in a Spanish-speaking household. He learned English by reading the Sunday comics. His family moved to Los Angeles, California, when he was eight years old. He first studied art formally in Manual Arts High School in Los Angeles, California. Immediately after high school he spent a year working on Krazy Kat for Screen Gems, then three years animating Tom and Jerry and Lonesome Stranger for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer as a \\"sketch man\\", before leaving to start his own comic strip. During World War II, he directed training films for the United States Army while continuing to produce Sunday Gordo cartoons. =Gordo (1942-1985)= Gus Arriola's Gordo (1964) Although Arriola did not visit Mexico until 1961, he used the human and animal characters of his strip to introduce Mexican culture to readers throughout the world. Gordo was initially designed to be a Mexican version of Li'l Abner, with a highly caricatured style and a lazy overweight title character who spoke in heavily accented English and took naps under a tree wearing a sombrero. The character reflected popular conceptions of Mexicans at the time, particularly Leo Carrillo's portrayal of The Cisco Kid's sidekick, Pancho, on television and film. After his early strips were criticized for Hollywood-style cultural stereotypes, Arriola realized that his was the only periodical work in American mass media that depicted life in Mexico and modified the strip to be more sympathetic. A much thinner and contemplative Gordo eventually became a flirtatious tour guide, whom Arriola often described as an \\"accidental ambassador\\" for Mexican culture. The strip introduced America to such now- popular words and phrases as \\"hasta la vista,\\" \\"amigo,\\" \\"piñata,\\" \\"compadre,\\" \\"muchacho\\" and \\"hasta mañana,\\" as well as Mayan, Aztec and Mexican customs, history and folklore. Arriola also periodically included traditional Mexican recipes in Gordo that proved popular, telling one interviewer, \\"In 1948 we ran Gordo's recipe for beans and cheese—which got me into 60 extra papers, by the way.\\" Arriola did all of the writing, illustration and production of Gordo himself, creating strips every day (except in his army years) for 45 years. Charles Schulz described it as \\"probably the most beautifully drawn strip in the history of the business.\\" Arriola received the National Cartoonist Society's Humor Comic Strip Award in 1957 and 1965. Although not overtly political, Gordo was also one of the first pop culture works that regularly raised environmentalist concerns. The last Gordo strip was published on March 2, 1985. Personal life While working on Gordo Arriola lived in La Jolla, California, Phoenix, Arizona and then Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, where he ran a shop selling Mexican arts, crafts, and artifacts from 1961 to 1963. Arriola met his wife, Mary Frances, at MGM in 1939. They remained married until his death. He died in Carmel on 2 February 2008. Shortly before his death he received a lifetime achievement award from the Arts Council for Monterey, California. He had suffered from Parkinson's disease. On February 20, 2008, the comic strip Baldo noted, \\"In memory of our amigo Gus Arriola, 1917-2008.\\" The March 21, 2008, version of the comic strip La Cucaracha, by Lalo Alcaraz, was also a tribute to Arriola.

It was derived by Robert Fano in the early 1950s while teaching a Ph.D. seminar in information theory at MIT, and later recorded in his 1961 textbook. It is used to find a lower bound on the error probability of any decoder as well as the lower bounds for minimax risks in density estimation. Let the random variables X and Y represent input and output messages with a joint probability P(x,y). Let e represent an occurrence of error; i.e., that X eq \\\\tilde{X}, with \\\\tilde{X}=f(Y) being an approximate version of X. Fano's inequality is :H(XY)\\\\leq H(e)+P(e)\\\\log(\\\\mathcal{X}-1), where \\\\mathcal{X} denotes the support of X, :H\\\\left(XY\\\\right)=-\\\\sum_{i,j} P(x_i, y_j)\\\\log P\\\\left(x_iy_j\\\\right) is the conditional entropy, :P(e)=P(X eq \\\\tilde{X}) is the probability of the communication error, and :H(e)=-P(e)\\\\log P(e)-(1-P(e))\\\\log(1-P(e)) is the corresponding binary entropy. Alternative formulation Let X be a random variable with density equal to one of r+1 possible densities f_1,\\\\ldots,f_{r+1}.

Then :\\\\sup_i P_i(\\\\psi(X) ot = i) \\\\geq 1-\\\\frac{\\\\beta+\\\\log 2}{\\\\log r} where P_i is the probability induced by f_i Generalization The following generalization is due to Ibragimov and Khasminskii (1979), Assouad and Birge (1983).

Biography  Branner was born in Manhattan, New York City on December 28, 1888. He was a twin and one of nine children of Bernard Brenner, a Jewish immigrant lacemaker. =Vaudeville= In 1905, Martin Branner was an assistant to two men who booked vaudeville acts. He was a dancer who met Edith Fabbrini (1892–1966) when he was 18 and she was 15. They married a few days after they met, and the couple then entered vaudeville as a dance team. Billed as Martin and Fabbrini, they spent 15 years performing in stock, musical comedy and vaudeville on the Keith Orpheum and Pantages circuits. In Manhattan, Martin and Fabbrini played the Palace Theater the second week it opened, and they often made return engagements.Monchak, Stephen J. \\"Branner Enters 20th Year with \\"Winnie,\\" Editor & Publisher, August 5, 1939. Some of Branner's earliest artwork was published during this period when he did advertising illustrations for Variety. Two shows a day sometimes increased to three and more shows daily, but bookings for the dance team became fewer during and following World War I. = World War I and a career transition = Branner served his World War I military duty with the Chemical Warfare Service of the U.S. Army. On his return after World War I, he left vaudeville and launched a new career as a cartoonist in 1919, beginning with a short-lived strip, Looie the Lawyer, for the Bell Syndicate. He followed with a Sunday page, Pete and Pinto, which ran for 20 weeks in the New York Herald and The Sun. =Winnie begins= right Martin Branner's Winnie Winkle (March 6, 1927) Branner launched Winnie Winkle the Breadwinner as a daily strip in September 1920, followed by a Sunday page in 1923. Edith Branner served as the model for the character of Winnie Winkle. Branner's 1934 to 1936 assistant was the French cartoonist Robert Velter. By 1939, Winnie Winkle the Breadwinner was printed in 125 newspapers in America and Europe for a combined circulation of more than eight and a half million. The title was shortened to Winnie Winkle in 1943. After Velter, Branner's long-time assistant was Max Van Bibber, who took over Winnie Winkle after Branner suffered a stroke in 1962. Following the stroke, Branner began to use a wheelchair. Without the use of his right hand, he continued to draw with his left. = Death = Martin Branner died at age 81 on May 19, 1970, at the Nutmeg Pavilion Convalescent Home in New London, Connecticut.  Personal life  Branner was a noted wit and drew on his vaudeville background for some gags appearing in his cartoons. After they retired their dance act, the Branners became the parents of Bernard Donald Branner and the art historian Robert Branner. Martin Branner converted to Roman Catholicism shortly after leaving the stage. Martin and Edith Branner lived at 27 Riverside Drive in Waterford, Connecticut, and they were the designers of Waterford's town seal. During their many visits to Manhattan, New York City, the Branners enjoyed living in hotels; they were frequent guests at the Iroquois Hotel, which Branner called \\"the poor man's Algonquin.\\" The Branner family usually spent summers boating and swimming in Connecticut. In 1957, Branner was a guest challenger on the television panel show To Tell the Truth. Awards Branner wrote and drew Winnie Winkle from 1920 to 1962, receiving the National Cartoonists Society Humor Comic Strip Award in 1958.NCS Awards Books Winnie Winkle and the Diamond Heirlooms by Branner and Helen Berke was a 248-page hardcover novel published by Whitman in 1946. Archives Syracuse University's Special Collections house the Martin Branner Cartoons collection of 300 original daily cartoons from Winnie Winkle (1920–1957). There is a complete week from each year represented, with additional random cartoons from each year. (There are no holdings for 1946-47.)

According to Microsoft, it will be possible for the different types of gadgets to run on different environments without modification, but this is currently not the case. The gadgets and the Windows desktop Sidebar were a hallmark feature in Windows Vista and Windows 7 editions of the operating system. Subsequently, Microsoft deemed them to be security vulnerabilities and discontinued developing and providing Microsoft Gadgets, which were no longer available by the time Windows 8 and 10 rolled out. Independent third party gadgets like Rainmeter continue to be developed and provided for later versions of Windows. Microsoft gadgets can also work on Windows XP Service Pack 3 but it needs Alky for Applications.  Types of Microsoft's gadgets  # Web gadgets - run on a web site, such as Bing.com or Spaces. # Sidebar gadgets - run on the desktop or be docked onto, run on the Windows Sidebar. # SideShow gadgets - run on auxiliary external displays, such as on the outside of a laptop or even on an LCD panel in a keyboard, and potentially mobile phones and other devices.  Web gadgets and Live.com  Web gadgets run on Web sites such as Live.com and Windows Live Spaces Live.com lets users add RSS feeds in order to view news at a glance. Building off Microsoft's start.com experimental page, Live.com can be customized with Web Gadgets, mini-applications that can serve almost any purpose (e.g. mail readers, weather reports, slide shows, search, games, etc.). Some gadgets integrate with other Windows Live services, including Mail, Search, and Favorites. Users can create multiple site tabs and customize each with different feeds, gadgets, layouts, and color schemes.  Desktop gadgets  Adding Desktop Gadgets Desktop gadgets are desktop widgets; small specialized applications that are generally designed to do simple tasks, such as clocks, calendars, RSS notifiers or search tools. They can also be used to control external applications such as Windows Media Center. A panel, or sidebar, is found on either the right side (default) or the left side of the Windows desktop in the Windows Vista operating system. Gadgets can be placed on this sidebar, and they are automatically aligned on it. Gadgets can also be placed elsewhere on the screen, which generally causes them to expand and display more information. In Windows 7, the sidebar is removed, although gadgets can somewhat similarly be aligned on any side of the screen. Gadgets are toggled between the two sizes via a button in Windows 7.  Device gadgets and Windows Sideshow  Windows SideShow is a new technology that lets Windows Vista drive small auxiliary displays of various form factors, offering bite-size pieces of information. These include displays embedded on the outside of a laptop lid or on a detachable device, enabling access to information and media even when the main system is in a standby mode. Data can also be displayed on cell phones and other network-connected devices via Bluetooth and other connectivity options. The display can be updated with a number of different kinds of information, such as contacts, maps, calendar, and email. This can then be consulted while the mobile PC is otherwise powered down. Since the underlying platform is so power-efficient, it can run for hundreds of hours without draining a notebook battery, while still providing always-on access to data and multimedia content. SideShow is coupled to the Windows Vista Sidebar capability – that is, Sidebar Gadgets are easily ported to be compatible with SideShow secondary display applications. However, hardware and silicon providers can also provide native capabilities to allow for richer multimedia applications such as text, image, audio and video decode / playback. For example, a notebook with an in-lid display could be used as an MP3 player while powered down, with the notebook battery providing hundreds of hours of playback time because of the low power footprint that the Sideshow platform maintains. Discontinuation and Revival According to Microsoft, Gadgets were discontinued because they have \\"serious vulnerabilities\\", \\"could be exploited to harm your computer, access your computer's files, show you objectionable content, or change their behavior at any time\\"; and \\"an attacker could even use a gadget to take complete control of your PC\\".Gadgets have been discontinued Gadgets were completely removed in Windows 8. However, with the launch of Windows 10, widespread support for Gadgets led to their revival as third-party enhancements to the new operating system, which adjusted to take account of them, including a link to the Gadgets Sidebar in the Windows Control Panel.Download Sidebar  Gadgets Revived8GadgetPack - Gadgets on Windows 10 / 8.1 / 8 Many hundreds are now available from a variety of sources and more are in active development.

It is a premium adult entertainment television channel aimed at gay men, with programming consisting mainly of adult films and adult-related television series. Playmen TV's licensee is 4510810 Canada Inc. which is wholly owned by Fifth Dimension Properties Inc., a company wholly owned by Stuart Duncan, majority owner of Ten Broadcasting. History PrideVision was launched in 2001 as Canada's first digital specialty service aimed towards the LGBT community. However, PrideVision had been unattractive to providers because of the gay pornographic programming it aired during east coast late-night hours, which would be broadcast as early as 10:00 p.m. in the Pacific Time Zone. Providers chose to package PrideVision as a standalone, premium adult channel rather than alongside other mainstream specialty channels—which hampered the network's reach. Shaw controversially required viewers to go through an authorization process, including a one-cent fee, to view the channel during its mandated free preview period. The provider considered this mechanism to be a response to the \\"overwhelming expressions of concern from our customers\\" over the adult content carried by the service, but PrideVision's owners filed a complaint to the CRTC alleging that Shaw was discriminating against the channel by refusing to give it a proper preview period, like the other digital channels that had also recently been launched.CRTC Rules In Favor Of Gay- themed Channel; AllBusiness.com; 2001-10-02 The CRTC reprimanded Shaw for its unfair treatment of PrideVision, and ordered that the provider properly offer a preview. In 2003, PrideVision was sold to a consortium led by veteran broadcaster William Craig. in September 2004, the ownership group filed an application to the CRTC for a new premium specialty service tentatively named 617, which would be \\"devoted to adult entertainment for the gay genre audience.\\" Later in November, PrideVision re-branded its adult programming block as Hard on PrideVision, and expanded it to run from 9:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. ET in anticipation of the new channel. In February 2005, Craig officially announced the Hard on PrideVision channel—a second 24-hour service devoted exclusively to gay adult programming, would launch in March 2005, alongside the re-launch of PrideVision under the new name OutTV. Craig argued that spinning off the pornographic content into a second service would allow more adult programming to be made available to viewers, while allowing OutTV to achieve wider carriage and increase its investments into programming of interest to the LGBT community. Hard on PrideVision's license was approved on March 4, 2005. On July 19, 2006, Shavick Entertainment, a film and television producer based in Vancouver, British Columbia, announced their intent to purchase a majority stake in both HARD on PrideVision and OUTtv from then majority owner William Craig.Shavick Entertainment Acquires OUTtv; Canada's Must-Carry Gay & Lesbian Television Network to be Expanded and Upgraded by Leading Production Company; BNET; 2006-07-19 The transaction was finalized later that year, with other investors shares changing to reflect Shavick's new ownership. In November 2006, Hard on PrideVision was renamed HardTV. On December 3, 2009, the CRTC approved an application on behalf of 4510810 Canada Inc, a newly formed company owned by Pink Triangle Press (55%) and Peace Point Entertainment (45%), that would see it acquire HardTV from 6166954 Canada Inc.

Asher moved to Florida to avoid the seasonal shutdown in painting, soon establishing a business painting condominiums on Florida's Gold Coast. By the age of 21, he had 100 painters working for him and was reportedly grossing US$10 million a year. Career In 1982 Asher smuggled cocaine while living in the Bahamas over a seven-week stint, flying to Colombia and Belize in his plane. Later he joined F.

In 1992, he started a business Database Technologies that used clusters of PCs to provide parallel supercomputing in place of more expensive mainframes and mini computers. His first contract was a data mining application for the insurance industry performed on records bought from the Florida's Department of Motor Vehicles. DBT Online bought Asher out for US$147 million in 1999 after the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration suspended their contracts following revelations with Asher's involvements in drug dealing in the Bahamas and concerns that the company could potentially monitor targets of investigations. Asher blamed his ouster from Database Technologies on board member Kenneth Langone who joined the company at his invitation.Database pioneer ready for new adventure, South Florida Business Journal, March 21, 2005, loaded April 2, 2007 After departing DBT Online, Asher founded Seisint in 1999 by merging two companies.

Asher counter-sued in 2001 in the Fort Lauderdale U.S. District Court alleging unfair business practices by ChoicePoint Director Kenneth Langone and sought more than US$1.6 billion in damages. Both suits were dismissed on March 8, 2005 after ChoicePoint settled with Asher. While at Seisint, Hank Asher played a leading role in developing the Multistate Anti- Terrorism Information Exchange (MATRIX) datamining system for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, described as a tool to help state law enforcement officials identify potential terrorists.

Philanthropy =Work with Missing and Exploited Children= Over the course of his career in the data business, Asher donated the services of his respective companies to an indeterminable number of law enforcement agencies and most notably the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. \\"No fewer than 109 children have been found as a direct result of Asher's help\\" according to Ernie Allen, president of National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Asher is the largest private donor in the history of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.

It is situated at the junction of the Afon Glesyrch's and Afon Dulas' valleys. Behind the village is the former Era slate quarry, in the Glesyrch valley, and the Centre for Alternative Technology lies about a mile south of the village. The minor road on the east side of the Afon Dulas is believed to be of Roman origin. In 1910, this road was still mostly cobbled, with sections that crossed bedrock showing deep wheel ruts. The Forestry Commission camp Immediately after the Second World War, the Forestry Commission established the Dovey Forest (later known as the Dyfi Forest) in the land between Corris and Aberangell. A major camp was established on the east side of Esgairgeiliog.  Murder of April Jones  In 2012, Mark Bridger, a resident of Ceinws, abducted and murdered five-year-old April Jones from the nearby town of Machynlleth. Bridger was sentenced to a whole life sentence. His house was subsequently torn down and a memorial garden to April Jones was erected on its site.  Railway Station  Esgairgeiliog railway station was a station on the narrow-gauge Corris Railway, although it was the opposite side of the Afon Dulas river from the village, making the station in the county of Merionethshire (now Gwynedd) as opposed to the village, which was in Montgomeryshire (now Powys). A steeply-graded branch line crossed the river and led to the Era quarry, where slate could be taken from for transport to Machynlleth for transshipment. The station was opened in 1884, and closed at the end of passenger services in December 1930. The station was structurally and cosmetically restored in the early 1980s. The Corris Railway Society is now restoring the line, through Esgairgeiliog. The station at Esgairgeiliog is the basis for Ulfstead Road, one of the Mid Sodor Railway's stations in The Railway Series.

He practiced law in Halifax and then, some time before 1842, moved to Guysborough, where he also served as a surrogate judge. Campbell represented Guysborough County in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly from 1851 to 1867. He was speaker for the assembly from 1856 to 1863. From 1863 to 1865, Campbell served on a commission to consolidate the statutes for Nova Scotia. On September 20, 1867, he was elected to the House of Commons of Canada as the first member to represent the riding of Guysborough. He was re-elected for a second term on October 12, 1872, but was defeated in an election on January 22, 1874. Having been opposed to Nova Scotia's entry into the Confederation of Canada in 1860s debates, he remained a member of the Anti-Confederation Party through his first year in office, which was in favour of reversing the decision to join the Confederation. In September 1868 he joined the Liberal-Conservative Party when the Anti- Confederation Party began to collapse, the first MP in Canadian history to cross the floor of Parliament.

The River Dwyryd runs alongside the village. Its population of 585 in 2001Snowdonia National Park Authority - 2001 Census Figures increased to 631 at the 2011 Census. The Community of Maentwrog includes the village of Gellilydan. Location and transport The village lies on the A496 between Harlech and Blaenau Ffestiniog, and also on the Roman road Sarn Helen, now classified as the B4410, at the junction with the A487 from Porthmadog, leading to the A470 (to Trawsfynydd and Dolgellau). Nearby Plas Tan y Bwlch, substantially rebuilt during the 19th century by the rich Oakeley family on the site of a first house probably built in the early 17th century,BBC page - Plas Tan y Bwlch overlooks the village. Plas Tan y Bwlch has its own halt - Plas Halt - on the Ffestiniog Railway, and nearby Tan-y-Bwlch railway station is the railway's principal intermediate station. The National Gazetteer of Great Britain and Ireland (1868) stated that Tan-y-Bwlch was the postal town of Maentwrog.Genuki history website Between 1882 and 1964 the nearest mainline station for passengers was 'Maentwrog Road', some two miles away; the use of \\"Road\\" in a station's name was a GWR euphemism for \\"not near the settlement in the station's name\\". Etymology Maentwrog means \\"Twrog's stone\\" (Welsh maen = stone). According to legend, a giant known as Twrog hurled a boulder from the top of a hill down into the settlement, destroying a pagan altar. This stone is said to be the one located in St Twrog's Church courtyard. It is said that if one rubs this boulder one is fated to return to the village in the future.Megalithic Portal website The name was already in existence before the 12th Century as, according to a story found in the Mabinogion, Pryderi is buried \\"at Maen Tyfiawg, above Y Felenrhyd\\" after being killed by Gwydion in a battle at Y Felenrhyd on the banks of the River Dwyryd about a mile from the town. The boulder supposedly hurled by the giant is also the one said to mark Pryderi's grave.The Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales An alternative source, the 'Stanzas of the Graves' from The Black Book of Carmarthen, states that the grave is at Aber Gwenoli which is located in the woodland now known as Coed Felinrhyd just above Y Felenrhyd. History The church is dedicated to the memory of Twrog, an eminent British saint, who lived in the 5th and 6th Centuries.Genuki history website According to information in St Twrog's Church, based on a late addition to the Bonedd y Saint, there were four brothers and sons of Ithel Hael o Lydaw (Brittany) who came to Wales as Christian missionaries: *Saint Baglan is the founder and patron saint of Baglan; *Saint Tanwg is the founder and patron saint of Llandanwg; *Saint Tegai is the founder and patron saint of Llandegai; *Saint Twrog is the founder and patron saint of Llandwrog and of Maentwrog. The village settlement expanded in the 19th century to house workers from local slate mines.Quarry Proprietors - The Meirionnydd Quarries Within the village community is the imposing Plas Tan y Bwlch, home of the Snowdonia National Park Study Centre and former residence of the Oakeley family. Maentwrog hydro- electric power station was opened in 1928, and still produces electricity today. It is supplied by water from Llyn Trawsfynydd, a large man-made reservoir located near the village of Trawsfynydd. The power station produces electricity for the local Welsh Power network while controlling the level of the water in the lake to protect the local wildlife on the lake shores. The station has 2 turbine sets, capable of producing approximately 32 MW, the head of water being roughly 180m. Social facilities There are two village inns: The Grapes Hotel, a 17th-century Grade 2 listed coaching inn near the parish church; and The Oakeley Arms, across the valley at Tan-y-Bwlch.

He was described by The Times as \\"the doyen of football writers—arguably the finest football writer of his—or any other—generation,\\" and by American journalist Paul Zimmerman as \\"the greatest football writer of all time.\\" Biography The son of an Irish Jewish dentist, Glanville was educated at Charterhouse School, where he played football to a high standard. He has had a lengthy career, beginning with ghost-writing Cliff Bastin Remembers, the autobiography of his hero, at 19. A noted critique of the British style of sportswriting in Encounter magazine in the late 1950s lamented the lack of depth compared to the American style of Red Smith, Damon Runyon or A. J. Liebling.New Statesman - Kicked into touch As a journalist he spent nearly 30 years as a football correspondent for The Sunday Times, to which he is still a contributor, and has contributed to World Soccer magazine for over 50 years in print and online; he currently contributes a weekly column to the website covering a range of issues. In the 1960s and 1970s, Glanville was a member of the jury which awards the yearly Ballon d'Or France Football (or European Footballer of the Year award). In addition has written for The People and more recently contributed several obituaries of prominent players to The Guardian.Guardian Unlimited  Search  In addition, his work has been seen in publications such as Sports IllustratedSI.com – Soccer – World Soccer's Glanville: Africa not ready for hosting – Tuesday May 25, 2004 9:41PM and the New Statesman,New Statesman - Brothers at war and the prominent American football writer Paul Zimmerman has called him \\"the greatest football writer of all time.\\"SI.com – Writers – More Mailbag – Friday June 8, 2007 1:59PM He spent much of his career based in Italy and has been seen as one of the leading authorities on Italian football as a result. Whilst based in both Florence and Rome, he wrote regularly for the Italian daily Corriere Dello Sport, as well as occasional pieces for La Stampa and Corriere della Sera. During the 1960s, Glanville worked as a writer for the satirical BBC TV programme That Was The Week That Was and wrote the screenplay for Goal!, the BAFTA award-winning official film of the 1966 World Cup, to which he also contributed the commentary. As a novelist he has written mostly about football and life in Italy, with his 1956 novel Along the Arno particularly well received by critics. He has also written The Story of the World Cup, a frequently updated history of the FIFA tournament. From the mid 1960s to the 1980s, Glanville organised and ran his own very successful (largely) amateur football team, Chelsea Casuals, which, depending on the quality of the opposition, comprised a motley collection of actors, artists, radio, TV and newspaper journalists, university graduates and undergraduates (mainly drawn from the LSE), friends (occasionally professional soccer players and from other sports including cricket. Anecdotes in his book of short stories The King of Hackney Marshes (1965) drew heavily on experiences gained not only from games on the Hackney Marshes but also at Wormwood Scrubs playing fields, the Chelsea Hospital ground and elsewhere. His novel The Rise of Gerry Logan (1963, 1965) predated the rise of the ex-professional radio and TV punditry of the Saint and Greavsie/Alan Hansen/Andy Gray variety. Glanville is a lifelong supporter of Arsenal F.C.. He is noted for taking a critical view of many issues, often in contrast to the typical British sportswriter. Since its formation, he has criticised the Premier League as the \\"Greed is Good League\\"World Soccer and FIFA president Sepp Blatter is referred to as \\"Sepp (50 ideas a day, 51 bad) Blatter\\". Glanville said: \\"The World Cup has become worse and worse over the years—it is bloated. Whatever Sepp Blatter thinks he knows is only secondary to the money he wants to make.\\" He has also said there are \\"far too many foreigners in the Premier League\\" and he criticised the spending of clubs like Manchester City and Chelsea as \\"repugnant\\". After covering England for many years, Glanville developed relationships with a few of the managers. He stated that Alf Ramsey could be \\"very spiky, but in the final analysis I didn't get on badly with him and he gave people access.\\" Glanville also mentioned how he thought Bobby Robson was \\"grotesquely overrated\\", that he was \\"a very inadequate manager and he failed so badly in Europe\\" (a reference to the failure to qualify for UEFA Euro 1984 and England's group stage exit from UEFA Euro 1988), and that nearly reaching the 1990 World Cup final was \\"down to luck more than judgement.\\" However, he was effusive in his praise of Paul Gascoigne in the latter, saying he had displayed \\"a flair, a superlative technique, a tactical sophistication, seldom matched by an England player since the war.\\" Bibliography =Novels= *The Reluctant Dictator - London, Laurie, 1952. *Henry Sows the Wind - London, Secker and Warburg, 1954. *Along the Arno - London, Secker and Warburg, 1956; New York, Crowell, 1957. *The Bankrupts - London, Secker and Warburg, and New York, Doubleday, 1958. *After Rome, Africa - London, Secker and Warburg, 1959. *Diamond - London, Secker and Warburg, and New York, FarrarStraus, 1962. *The Rise of Gerry Logan - London, Secker and Warburg, 1963; New York, Delacorte Press, 1965. *A Second Home - London, Secker and Warburg, 1965; New York, Delacorte Press, 1966. *A Roman Marriage - London, Joseph, 1966; New York, CowardMcCann, 1967. *The Artist Type - London, Cape, 1967; New York, Coward McCann, 1968. *The Olympian - New York, Coward McCann, and London, Secker andWarburg, 1969. *A Cry of Crickets - London, Secker and Warburg, and New York, Coward McCann, 1970. *Goalkeepers are Different, 1971 *The Financiers - London, Secker and Warburg, 1972; as Money Is Love, New York, Doubleday, 1972. *The Thing He Loves - London Secker & Warburg, 1974. *The Comic - London, Secker and Warburg, 1974; New York, Stein andDay, 1975. *The Dying of the Light - London, Secker and Warburg, 1976. *Never Look Back - London, Joseph, 1980. *Kissing America - London, Blond, 1985. *The Catacomb - London, Hodder and Stoughton, 1988. *Dictators - London, Smaller Sky Books, 2001. =Short stories= *A Bad Streak and Other Stories - London, Secker and Warburg, 1961. *The Director's Wife and Other Stories - London, Secker and Warburg, 1963. *Goalkeepers Are Crazy: A Collection of Football Stories - London, Secker and Warburg, 1964. *The King of Hackney Marshes and Other Stories - London, Secker and Warburg, 1965. *A Betting Man - New York, Coward McCann, 1969. *Penguin Modern Stories 10, with others - London, Penguin, 1972. *The Thing He Loves and Other Stories - London, Secker and Warburg, 1973. *A Bad Lot and Other Stories - London, Penguin, 1977. *Love Is Not Love and Other Stories - London, Blond, 1985. =Plays= * Visit to the Villa (produced Chichester, Sussex, 1981). * Underneath the Arches, with Patrick Garland and Roy Hudd (produced Chichester, Sussex, 1981; London, 1982). =Screenplays (documentary)= *Goal!, 1967. =Radio plays= *The Diary, 1987; I Could Have Been King, 1988. *Television Documentaries: European Centre Forward, 1963. =Other= *Cliff Bastin Remembers, with Cliff Bastin.

Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, she graduated from Hughes Center High School and from the University of Cincinnati in 1912. She started her tennis career at the age 22, when she was talked into entering the singles draw at the prestigious Tri-State Championship at Cincinnati by her brother. Completely unknown and having only the UC Championship to her credit, she stunned the tennis world by defeating Elizabeth Bunce, the 1911 National Indoor Doubles champion from New York City, 6–2, 6–3, in the singles final, and then beating defending two-time champion Marjorie Dodd, one of the top players in the Midwest, by the same score in the Challenge Round. Later at the important Bi-State Tournament in Louisville, she defeated Louisville champion Mary Schreve Lyons, 6–0, 6–1, in the finals. Thereafter, and throughout her distinguished career from 1913 through 1923 (during which time she had children 1918, 1919 and 1921), she won numerous titles, the most important of which were singles, doubles and mixed doubles titles at the 1917 National Clay Court Championship, and five singles titles at the storied international tennis tournament in her hometown, now known as the Cincinnati Masters & Women's Open. Those titles came in 1913, ‘14, ‘20, ‘22 & ’23. She also won a doubles title (1911) at Cincinnati and reached two doubles finals (1915 & 1920) as well. In an age before the Midwest had women's rankings, she was nonetheless considered the best by those in the know at the time. Against national-class players appearing in tournaments near her home, she defeated many and reportedly lost only twice: to the U.S. No. 5 ranked Louise Riddell Williams (Mrs. R.H. Williams), 6–1, 6–4, in the semifinals of the 1914 National Clay Court, and by Northwestern Champion Margaret Davis of St. Paul, 6–1, 5–7, 6–1, at Cincinnati in 1916. She was reportedly too ill to play that 1916 Cincinnati tournament, but played anyway just to please her friends. The only time she was completely outclassed was when she lost to the then national champion and eventually Hall of Famer Molla Bjurstedt, 6–0, 6–4, in the Challenge Round at Cincinnati in 1915. Unfortunately, her dislike of and refusal to travel long distances, necessary for national ranking consideration, prevented her earning several national \\"Top Ten\\" women's singles rankings. Sanders married Howard F. Cordes on August 14, 1917, shortly after she and her groom won the National Clay Court Mixed Doubles Championship over nationally ranked teams in the semifinals and finals. She was a grade school teacher in Cincinnati (in the neighborhood of North Fairmount) and later in life took up golf. She became one of the best amateur golfers in Cincinnati. In 2003, she was posthumously inducted into the Cincinnati Tennis Hall of Fame.http://www.cincytennis.com/news/cincinnati_tennis_hall_of_fame_inducts_50th_member/ References *From Club Court to Center Court by Phillip S.

Since the network may be accessible to other users, a method for forbidding access to programs run by users different from the one who is logged in is necessary. There are five standard access control mechanisms that control whether a client application can connect to an X display server. They can be grouped in three categories: # access based on host # access based on cookie # access based on user Additionally, like every other network connection, tunneling can be used.  Host-based access  The host-based access method consists in specifying a set of hosts that are authorized to connect to the X display server. This system has inferior security, as it allows every user who has access to such a host to connect to the display. The \`xhost\` program and three X Window System core protocol requests are used to activate this mechanism and to display and change the list of authorized hosts. Improper use of \`xhost\` can inadvertently give every host on the Internet full access to an X display server.  Cookie- based access  The cookie-based authorization methods are based on choosing a magic cookie (an arbitrary piece of data) and passing it to the X display server when it is started; every client that can prove having knowledge of this cookie is then authorized connecting to the server. These cookies are created by a separate program and stored in the file \`.Xauthority\` in the user's home directory, by default. As a result, every program run by the client on the local computer can access this file and therefore the cookie that is necessary for being authorized by the server. If the user wants to run a program from another computer on the network, the cookie has to be copied to that other computer. How the cookie is copied is a system-dependent issue: for example, on Unix-like platforms, scp can be used to copy the cookie. The two systems using this method are \`MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1\` and \`XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1\`. In the first method, the client simply sends the cookie when requested to authenticate. In the second method, a secret key is also stored in the \`.Xauthority\` file. The client creates a string by concatenating the current time, a transport-dependent identifier, and the cookie, encrypts the resulting string, and sends it to the server. The xauth application is a utility for accessing the \`.Xauthority\` file. The environment variable \`XAUTHORITY\` can be defined to override the name and location of that cookie file. The Inter- Client Exchange (ICE) Protocol implemented by the Inter-Client Exchange Library for direct communication between X11 clients uses the same \`MIT-MAGIC- COOKIE-1\` authentication method, but has its own iceauth utility for accessing its own \`.ICEauthority\` file, the location of which can be overridden with the environment variable \`ICEAUTHORITY\`. ICE is used, for example, by DCOP and the X Session Management protocol (XSMP).  User-based access  The user-based access methods work by authorizing specific users to connect to the server. When a client establishes a connection to a server, it has to prove being controlled by an authorized user. The two methods based on authenticating users using networked identity management systems are \`SUN-DES-1\` and \`MIT- KERBEROS-5\`. The first system is based on a secure mechanism of the ONC remote procedure call system developed in SunOS. The second mechanism is based on both client and server trusting a Kerberos server. A third method is limited to local connections, using system calls to ask the kernel what user is on the other end of a local socket. The \`xhost\` program can be used to add or remove \`localuser\` and \`localgroup\` entries with this method.  Tunneling  The SSH utility (when invoked with option \`-X\` or option \`ForwardX11\`) tunnels X11 traffic from remotely invoked clients to the local server. It does so by setting at the remote site the \`DISPLAY\` environment variable to point to a local TCP socket opened there by sshd, which then tunnels the X11 communication back to ssh. Sshd then also calls xauth to add at the remote site an MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 string into \`.Xauthority\` there, which then authorizes X11 clients there to access the ssh user's local X server. X11 connections between client and server over a network can also be protected using other secure-channel protocols, such as Kerberos/GSSAPI or TLS, although such options are now far more rarely used than SSH.

Stationed deep into the Amazon rainforest, they had little direct contact with Europeans until around 1910, and even then that contact was sporadic until the 1950s. The main reports about the Tapirapé were written by anthropologists Herbert Baldus (1899–1970) and Charles Wagley (1913–1991) and by a group of the Little Sisters of Jesus, missionary nuns who have helped the Tapirapé continuously since 1953. Origins and distribution Wagley conjectures that the Tapirapé descend from the Tupinamba, who populated part of the coast of Brazil in 1500, since both tribes speak the same Tupi language. As the conquerors expanded their dominion, the theory goes, some Tupinamba would have fled inland, eventually arriving at a large segment of tropical forest 11 degrees latitude South of the equator, close to affluents of the Amazon river. By 1900, there were five Tapirapé villages with a population of about 1500, extended through a large area between 50 and 51 degrees longitude. Sporadic contact with white Brazilians started in 1910; they brought iron tools and trade goods. They also brought with them germs: measles, mumps, and the common cold. American Elizabeth Kilgore SteenWagley, Charles. Welcome of Tears. Waveland Press, 1977, p. 36. spent the night in Tampitawa, one of the five villages, in 1930.Steen, Elizabeth (Sept. 1931). Paddling my own canoe. Good Housekeeping, p. 46. She returned with a number of examples of Tapirape material culture which are housed at the Museum of the American Indian in Washington, D.C. The book Brazilian Adventure by Peter Fleming tells of contact in 1932. By 1939, epidemics and some skirmishes with neighboring tribes had reduced population to just 187 individuals in only one village called Tapiitawa; by 1953 there were only 51 left. That year, the Little Sisters started their mission among the Tapirapé, and the Brazilian government established a post of the Indian Protection Service. The population started to recover, and by 1976 there were again about 136 Tapirapé. Economic system This and the following sections focus on the Tapirapé as they were observed by Wagley in 1939. The last section mentions Wagley’s observations since that time. The Tapirapé lived from slash and burn horticulture, hunting and fishing. Patches of forest were cleared and then burned to produce fertile soil that was planted only once or twice before clearing another patch. Each Tapirapé loghouse, hosting four or five families related through maternal links, owned its own garden; however both agricultural and hunting products could be shared among people from other houses. There was individual private property of objects such as tools, hammocks, baskets, strings of beads and so on; however there were several mechanisms of object distribution. Services such as shamanic cures, midwifing and others were usually paid with gifts; gifts were also given to repair offenses and in friendship relationships. Further, Wagley describes an annual gift exchange ceremony that served to distribute excess wealth among the less fortunate. In this ceremony, all men in the village had the opportunity to take a sip of \\"bad kawi\\", a horribly-tasting drink that produces strong nausea. Powerful, rich people usually choose not to taste it, but in exchange they had to donate gifts to those who did. People with less wealth then usually took the horrid sip, in order to receive gifts. Social organization Each family loghouse had a leader; however these leaders were not organized in any sort of village council, and did not elect a village chief. The loghouses were located in an oval formation surrounding the takana - a sort of men's club and home of the six Bird Societies, each named after a species of bird. Men spent part of the day in the takana. Membership on a Bird Society was by parental lineage; thus each such society mixed up people from several loghouses and served as a medium to integrate the population. Bird Societies organized group hunts and sometimes group expeditions to clear gardens. Both men and women belonged to one of a few Feast Groups used for food sharing in the village plaza. After marriage, men went to live with their wife’s family. Intercourse continued after pregnancy, often by several men besides the husband since it was felt that the child would become stronger with more semen. The Tapirapé were one of few cultures outside modern First World economies where adult men could engage in egalitarian homosexual relationships without one of them taking on a woman's role.Hinsch, Bret. (1990). Passions of the Cut Sleeve. Published by University of California Press. p. 13. Children enjoyed a great deal of liberty; after boys became adolescents, they could start going to the takana. A coming-of-age ceremony was performed when they became young adults. The Tapirapé exercised a strong population control policy. No couple could bear more than three children, and not more than two of the same sex. This was implemented by immediate infanticide of any extra newborn babies. The reason they gave for this policy was simply economics: given their technology and means of subsistence, they estimated that no man could support and adequately care for more than three children. Body aesthetics The Tapirapé didn't use any clothing whatsoever in their daily life; however, the men covered with a small cone attached to the prepuce. Women squatted and sat with their legs together. Both women and men painted their bodies with diverse designs according to age and gender. On special ceremonies and dances they would also use skirts, anklets and wrist bands. Religion Tapirapé Mask Their religion was based on shamanism. Shamans could communicate with a variety of spirits, from kind to unfriendly. Spirits were believed to live in the Takana on a cyclic basis; each “belonged” to a particular Bird Society. When one of the spirits was present, two members of the corresponding Bird Society impersonated and attached himself to the spirit by wearing a special mask and other pieces of clothing until their whole body was covered; they then went dancing around the village and received good kawi (a manioc drink) from every loghouse. Shamans were called in to cure disease. The shaman gulped great quantities of tobacco thus producing a sort of trance state; he then blew smoke on the sick person while performing a massage to make a bad spirit or an object leave the body. If several related people died from disease, a shaman would typically be accused of performing sorcery and was sometimes assassinated by the kin of the deceased relatives. Shamans were also called in to give the spirit to a child about to be born; the shaman dreamed-in the spirit while in trance state. They also purified agricultural and hunting products. Shamans went to Shaman Village after death. The Tapirapé had a rich mythology. Culture heroes were previous very powerful Shamans that had performed valuable services for humanity. The Tapirapé from 1940 to 1970 Wagley came back to visit the Tapirapé in 1953, 1957 and then in 1965. He reports on the changes brought to Tapirapé culture as the surrounding Brazilian culture was encroaching on them. Population control by infanticide was a terrible policy in the face of epidemics brought by contact with white conquerors. The Little Sisters were able to end this practice by around 1954. A shaman was killed in 1964 in vengeance for a similar killing that had occurred 20 years before. The assassin was brought to the Brazilian police and spent three months awaiting trial; but after the judge learned of the reason for the murder and considering all the cultural aspects involved, he decided to acquit the murderer and ordered him back to his village. By 1965, the Tapirapé were concentrated in New Village, created by the Brazilian Government in order to protect them and just a few miles from the nearest trading post; this however increased contact with whites and furthered cultural influence. Loghouses had shrunk in size and some of them had become single-family houses built with mortar. The takana and the Bird Societies still existed, although the takana activities now included manufacturing Indian artifacts for trade. Some women had started to use skirts and blouses and men had begun to wear shorts at least when receiving visitors or trading goods. Brazilian music in addition to Tapirapé music was beginning to be heard at parties, and alcoholic drinks were starting to be drunk despite strong protests from the Little Sisters and the Indian Protection officers. Although the gift system persisted, some men possessed Brazilian bank notes and had started to understand the value of these pieces of paper. Some land had been allocated for the exclusive use of the Tapirapé by the Brazilian government; however, powerful land companies were already claiming that land. Wagley (p. 125) cites from a speech by a Tapirapé at the First Assembly of Indigenous Chiefs in 1974: > (…) The ranches are surrounding us (…) the land companies are taking away > all of our land. Why did the whites want to pacify us? Afterwards, what is > it going to happen to us in the middle of whites working for whites that > want to take away our land? Is it meant that the Indian should have nothing > and to put an end to the Indians? The whites arrived and decided that the > Indian could find another place to live. Where should we go? The Indian > lives in the place where he knows. If he moves to another place in the > riverbanks, in the hills, in the lowlands this is no good.

History  = Karlin & Collins, Inc. = The company was founded in 1985 by Barry Karlin and Galen Collins. Karlin, originally from South Africa, told interviewers that he started the company after being frustrated with a paper map of the San Francisco, California area. He thought 'Wouldn't it be nice if I had someone sitting next to me in the car who knew the way?'International Directory of Company Histories, Vol.69. St. James Press, 2005 Collins created a pilot navigation system in the San Francisco area. However, basic testing showed the system could generate impossible directions. They realized that the system not only had to have accurate maps, but also detailed data on turn restrictions, one-way streets and other local issues. They were turned down by most venture capital firms in their attempts to finance the database but the president of Budget Rent A Car suggested they ask T. Russell Shields, a Chicago entrepreneur and founder of Shields Enterprises International, which specialized in building order fulfillment databases. Shields provided US$500,000 in seed money. In 1985, Karlin & Collins, Inc., based in Sunnyvale, California, began comprehensive mapping of the San Francisco Bay Area getting another US$2.5 million from Prudential Bache. Karlin and Collins made use of the newly created U.S. Census electronic map (TIGER files) which was matched with aerial photographs. They hired people to drive every road carrying a Dictaphone describing the position. In lieu of using a GPS, they kept track of the location of the vehicle using a dead reckoning system that relied on a gyro compass. In 1987, they unveiled their first product, DriverGuide, which was a countertop kiosk installed at car rental agencies and hotel lobbies and printed door-to-door driving directions. They later produced a coin-operated kiosk charging 50 cents. A total of 80 machines worth US$12,000 were installed around the San Francisco Bay Area and were a success. Shields invested another $3 million on condition he be named chief operating officer. The company was renamed Navigation Technologies Corporation. A competitive environment was quickly arising with Etak being the most notable. Etak's offering was an in-car system that showed your location on the map but did not offer directions. =Navigation Technologies Corporation (NavTech)= In the 1990s, the company changed its business model so that instead of building kiosks itself, it licensed its maps to be used by other hardware makers. Philips Electronics acquired the company in the early 1990s and invested nearly US$600 million in building the database for a car-based mapping device. Both Karlin and Collins left after the takeover but Shields remained, rising to chief executive officer in 1996. =Navteq= Philips on several occasions tried to take the company public but backed off each time until finally going public in February 2004. The company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol \\"NVT\\". The company render their name as 'NAVTEQ', in all capitals. Navteq is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois with more than 5,500 employees worldwide working in 202 offices in 53 countries, including regional headquarters in Veldhoven, Netherlands and Singapore. It also owns and operates major production centers in Fargo, North Dakota; Leon, Mexico; Veldhoven, Netherlands; and Mumbai, India. In early 2007, Navteq acquired The Map Network, the largest supplier of mapping to U.S. tourism and convention agencies. Later that year, Navteq moved their headquarters from Chicago's Merchandise Mart complex to the Boeing Building in Chicago. In September 2009, Navteq acquired Acuity Mobile, a mobile marketing technology company. =Nokia subsidiary= On 1 October, 2007, it was announced that Nokia would acquire Navteq in a deal valued at an estimated US$8.1 billion (€5.7 billion).

Semidiagrammatic. z.p. Zona pellucida. p.gl. Polar bodies. a. Two-cell stage. b. Four-cell stage. c. Eight-cell stage. d, e. Morula stage. A polar body is a small haploid cell that is formed concomitantly as an egg cell during oogenesis, but generally does not have the ability to be fertilized. When certain diploid cells in animals undergo cytokinesis after meiosis to produce egg cells, they sometimes divide unevenly. Most of the cytoplasm is segregated into one daughter cell, which becomes the egg or ovum, while the smaller polar bodies only get a small amount of cytoplasm. They frequently die and disintegrate by apoptosis, but in some cases remain and can be important in the life cycle of the organism. Twinning Polar body twinning is a hypothesized form of twinning in meiosis, where one or more polar bodies do not disintegrate and are fertilized by sperm. Twinning would occur, in principle, if the egg cell and a polar body were both fertilized by separate sperms. However, even if fertilization occurs, further development would usually not occur because the zygote formed by the fusion of the sperm and polar body would not have enough cytoplasm or stored nutrients to feed the developing embryo. Polar bodies were first reported in 1824 by Carus in gastropods, but their role was not clarified until the work of Butschli in 1875, Giard in 1876, and finally Hertwig in 1877. These structures were often confused with egg fragments or expelled yolk masses, but were eventually referred to as directional bodies (or Richtungskorper), a term implying the place where the maturation divisions start. The common names \\"polocytes\\" and \\"polar bodies\\" derive from their polar position in the eggs. Polar bodies were characterized in the early 20th century, by O. Hertwig, T. Boveri, and E.L. Mark, as non-functioning egg cells which disintegrated because the spermatozoon, with rare exceptions, could not fertilize them and instead chemically triggered their dissolution. Polar bodies serve to eliminate one half of the diploid chromosome set produced by meiotic division in the egg, leaving behind a haploid cell. To produce the polar bodies, the cell must divide asymmetrically, which is fueled by furrowing (formation of a trench) near a particular point on the cell membrane. The presence of chromosomes induces the formation of an actomyosin cortical cap, a myosin II ring structure and a set of spindle fibers, the rotation of which promotes invagination at the edge of the cell membrane and splits the polar body away from the oocyte. Meiotic errors can lead to aneuploidy in the polar bodies, which, in the majority of cases, produces an aneuploid zygote. Errors can occur during either of the two meiotic divisions that produce each polar body, but are more pronounced if they occur during the formation of the first polar body, because the formation of the first polar body influences the chromosomal makeup of the second. For example, predivision (the separation of chromatids before anaphase) in the first polar body can induce the formation of an aneuploid polar body. Therefore, the formation of the first polar body is an especially important factor in forming a healthy zygote. However, chromosomally abnormal polar bodies are not guaranteed to induce the development of an abnormal zygote. A euploid zygote can be produced if the aneuploidy is reciprocal: one polar body has an extra chromosome and the other lacks the same chromosome (see also uniparental disomy). If the extra chromosome is absorbed into a polar body rather than being passed into the oocyte, trisomy can be avoided. Whether this is a chance event or is some way influenced by the microenvironment is unclear. In at least one case, this euploid zygote has been traced through development to birth as a healthy child with a normal chromosome count. Medical applications A polar body biopsy is the sampling of a polar body of an oocyte. After sampling of a polar body, subsequent analysis can be used to predict viability and pregnancy chance of the oocyte, as well as the future health of a person resulting such pregnancy. The latter use makes it a form of preimplantation genetic screening (PGS). Compared to a blastocyst biopsy, a polar body biopsy can potentially be of lower costs, less harmful side-effects, and more sensitive in detecting abnormalities. The main advantage of the use of polar bodies in PGD is that they are not necessary for successful fertilisation or normal embryonic development, thus ensuring no deleterious effect for the embryo. One of the disadvantages of PB biopsy is that it only provides information about the maternal contribution to the embryo, which is why cases of autosomal dominant and X-linked disorders that are maternally transmitted can be diagnosed, and autosomal recessive disorders can only partially be diagnosed. Another drawback is the increased risk of diagnostic error, for instance due to the degradation of the genetic material or events of recombination that lead to heterozygous first polar bodies.

History  =Construction= Work on designing new family of Polish locomotives, able to pull trains with speeds higher than 125 km/h, started in the 1970s. Of those plans only one was finally realised, which resulted in construction of EP09 locomotives. In the beginning of the 1980s the CMK line (rail trunk line) was suited for passenger transport. Before that time it had been used exclusively for freight transport. At first EU05 and EP05 locomotives were used to service this line, but Polish railways needed faster locomotives, reaching 160 km/h. The machine was designed in Ośrodek Badawczo-Rozwojowy Pojazdów Szynowych (Rolling Stock Research and Development Centre) in Poznań. The prototype was ready in 1986, built in Pafawag in Wrocław. The machine was intended to be built with western parts, but severe financial restrictions caused many modern solutions to be abandoned. Co- operation with USSR gave little effect as well. Additionally, after the collapse of Eastern Bloc Poland was forced to use old EP07 solutions in later series of EP09. =Deployment= It is impossible to find two identical locomotives of this class, as the design changed after each machine was completed. The First EP09 locomotive was presented in 1986, the next one in 1987. On May 29, 1988, according to the new timetable, those two locomotives started regular service. In 2005 EP09's livery was revised and unveiled. The locomotives are being repainted in during scheduled servicing. All the locomotives produced, except for EP09-035(which was involved in the Szczekociny rail crash) are still fully operational, and are deployed in the locomotive depots in Kraków and Warsaw. 12 units work in Kraków Prokocim depot, the rest are assigned to Warsaw. Besides running on the CMK line, those locomotives can be spotted on Warsaw-Poznań-Szczecin, Warsaw-Poznań-Wrocław, Warsaw-Lublin and Warsaw-Kielce lines. EP09 series proved itself to be highly defective, e.g. in 1996 PKP was forced to replace 10 traction motors and 24 bogies. In the same time serious breakdowns of compressors were noted. In the end of 2000 EP09 were temporally sent to Gdańsk. This was done in order to accustom engineers with this type of locomotive before rising top speed on Warsaw-Gdańsk line.  Technical data  EP09-47 (left) and EP09-30 locomotives in Warsaw. Note the difference between front parts of locomotives (EP09-47 has additional air-intake mounted due to air-conditioning system installed) and between the types of pantographs. EP09 is a Bo-Bo electric locomotive working in 3000 V DC electric system. The box is placed on two bogies. Each bogie has two, separately propelled axles. Crew compartments are located on either side of the box. There are battery box and air tanks mounted between bogies. Traction motors and transmissions are locked inside bogies. Behind each crew compartment the machine compartment is located. High voltage compartment is situated in the middle of the machine. EP09 is the first Polish locomotive to have electro-dynamic brakes. This enables braking the locomotive using the motors configured to work as generators. Other modifications to EP09 machine were e.g. ergonomic dashboard and windscreens equipped with internal heating. Since locomotive number 38 the system of suspending locomotive on bogies was changed into Flexicoil and single pantographs (DSA200, Stemmann production) were mounted instead of the previously used double ones. Another important change during the production process is installing air conditioning system (since locomotive number 40). At present PKP works on bringing all machines into the same standard as the last two locomotives (046 and 047) brought into service in January 1998.  Nicknames  * Dziewiątka (The Nine) - after the number in the name * Epoka (The Epoch) - after the first two letters of the name Accidents On 3 March 2012 the EP09 with number 035 was involved in the Szczekociny rail crash. The locomotive was later scrapped.

Social interaction directly correlated with sociology regarding social structure. One of the most important social structures is status. This is determined based on position that an individual possesses which effects how they will be treated by society. One of the most important statuses an individual claims is gender. Public discourse and the academic literature generally use the term gender for the perceived or projected (self-identified) masculinity or femininity of a person. Introduction The term gender role was coined by John Money in a seminal 1955 paper where he defined it as \\"all those things that a person says or does to disclose himself or herself as having the status of boy or man, girl or woman.\\" A person's gender is complex, encompassing countless characteristics of appearance, speech, movement and other factors not solely limited to biological sex. Societies tend to have binary gender systems in which everyone is categorized as male or female. Some societies include a third gender role; for instance, the Native American Two-Spirit people and the Hijras of India. There is debate over the extent to which gender is a social construct or a biological construct . In feminist theory In the 1960s and 1970s, the women's movement started the momentum that led to the formation of the Feminist Theory. One of the publications that caused this movement was Betty Friedan's The Feminine Mystique.This book described how women were expected to be fulfilled throughout their housework.Burkett, Elinor. “Women's Rights Movement.” Encyclopædia Britannica, Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc., 13 Feb. 2019, www.britannica.com/event/womens-movement. https://www.britannica.com/event/womens-movement This book immediately resonated with many women as it became a bestseller, and a movement was ignited. During this movement, also known as the Women's rights movement or women's liberation movement, women fought for equal rights, and more personal freedom in all aspects of life such as politics, work, family and sexuality. In June 1966 the National Organization for Women (NOW) was born in order to create political change. Although the organization did not succeed right initially, by 1969 NOW was more comfortable with lobbying for women's reform in Washington. In 1972 Congress passed the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA). Despite it being a victory for feminism, the passage of the ERA led to criticism from anti-feminist, who argued that the ratification of the ERA would result in the invalidation of sodomy laws, and would lead to the legalization of same sex marriage. The ERA needed to be ratified by 38 states in ten years, and feel short by three. This was the second wave of feminism, after the first wave in the 19th for women's suffrage, and the foundation of early feminist theory. During the 1970s, there was no consensus about how the terms were to be applied. In the 1974 edition of Masculine/Feminine or Human, the author uses \\"innate gender\\" and \\"learned sex roles\\", but in the 1978 edition, the use of sex and gender is reversed. By 1980, most feminist writings had agreed on using gender only for socioculturally adapted traits. The Feminist Theory is a broad term for a variety of theories which all emphasize women's experiences and the belief that society is subordinate to women. Liberal feminism is the belief that individuals should be free to develop their own talents and pursue their interests. Individuals seek to expand equality by removing the barriers in society. Socialist feminism thinks that capitalism strengthens patriarchy by concentrating wealth and power in the hands of a few. The traditional family structure should be replaced by a collective revolution. In Radical feminism, they believe that patriarchy is so deeply rooted in society that even a sociological revolution would not end it; Society must eliminate gender itself. Early feminist theory targeted sex and gender and the injustices bases on these gender categories. However, the early feminist movement was geared towards the equality for white middle-class women only. It excluded other minority women, especially black women. Minority women face different experiences and struggles from white middle-class women, but this was largely overlooked in early feminist theory. However, this theory allowed for the birth of feminism, which focuses on women's empowerment, freedom, and the enhancement of a woman's sense of self. As time progresses, feminism can be broken into 4 distinct waves: first-wave from the 19th to early 20th century, second-wave feminism from the 1960s to 1970s, to the third and fourth waves of feminism from the 1990s to now.Burkett, Elinor. “Women's Rights Movement.” Encyclopædia Britannica, Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc., 13 Feb. 2019, www.britannica.com/event/womens-movement. https://www.britannica.com/event/womens-movement Each wave of feminism has its own goal that focused on the importance of equality among men and women in regards to social, political, and economic equality.Conley, Dalton. You May Ask Yourself: an Introduction to Thinking like a Sociologist. 5th ed., W.W. Norton, 2019. In the first wave, feminists focused on women's suffrage, or giving women the right to vote. It was a movement that pushed for political equality, so that women could participate in politics.Rampton, M. (2019, May 30). Four Waves of Feminism. Retrieved October 16, 2019, from https://www.pacificu.edu/about/media/four-waves-feminism. But in this movement, it mainly advocated for the right to vote for white women, while excluding minority women. The exclusion of minority women in first movement sparked the acknowledgement of minority groups in the second movement. However, the main goal of the second movement dealt with sexuality and reproductive rights. The movement's efforts worked toward the passing of the Equal Rights Amendment, which was designed to guarantee equal rights for everyone regardless of their sex. By the end of this wave, society began to realize that gender, the idea of what it means to be a “woman,” and society's expectations of what a woman is, are socially constructed. This realization led to the rise of the third feminist movement. It focused on debunking the predominant idea society held for women and their position in society. In this movement, the notion of being “girly” or “feminine” is being broken down to redefine society's definition of a women. The boundaries of gender are being reconstructed to allow people to experiment with the fluidity of gender. However, this movement also combats the sexism and patriarchy, or the system in which men hold all the power. This is shown through the domination of sexist culture, where women are looked down upon for the same actions or experiences men partake in. The fourth wave of feminism began in 2013 and centers around sexual harassment, rape culture, and body shaming. One of the major distinctions in this wave is the use of social media and the internet to spread its messages. This wave erupted after a young woman in India died after being brutally gang raped. Another catalyst to this wave of feminism was the election of president Donald Trump in 2016 after his remarks about women. One day after President Trump's inauguration, in 2017, about 4.6 million people took to the streets of Washington DC to the Women's March to protest gender equality. Also in 2017, the Me Too movement gained popularity, in which women came forward to share their experiences of sexual assault after it became known that Harvey Weinstein sexually assaulted women for years in the film industry. This movement grew in only a couple of months to condemn powerful men in business, politics, news, and entertainment for their assaults against women.The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica. “Feminism: The Fourth Wave.” Encyclopædia Britannica, Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc., www.britannica.com/explore/100women/issues/feminism-the-fourth-wave/. Other languages In English, both sex and gender are used in contexts where they could not be substituted (sexual intercourse; anal sex; safe sex; sex worker; sex slave). Other languages, like German, use the same word Geschlecht to refer both to grammatical gender and to biological sex, making the distinction between sex and gender advocated by some anthropologists difficult. In some contexts, German has adopted the English loan-word gender to achieve this distinction. Sometimes 'Geschlechtsidentität' is used as gender (although it literally means gender identity) and 'Geschlecht' as sex (translation of Judith Butler's Gender Trouble). More common is the use of modifiers: biologisches Geschlecht for sex, Geschlechtsidentität for gender identity and Geschlechterrolle for gender role etc. U.S. media Media criticism is a reflection of the gender inequality in society through print, advertisements, television and music. The Media is often criticized for holding women to unrealistic beauty standards: perfect skin, slim figure, and great hair. Some argue that the media's standards of beauty led to young girls having a lower self esteem, and blame the media for contributing to eating disorders. The US media is also criticized for displaying images which depict violence against women. Studies have revealed ways in which women are maimed, sliced, and raped in advertising images. However, the media is a product of different cultural values. Western culture creates cultural gender roles based on the meanings of gender and cultural practices. Western culture has clear distinctions among sex and gender, where sex is the biological differences and gender is the social construction. However, sex still influences how society perceives a certain gender. Since culture is created though the communication among society, communication is essential to the formation of gender roles in culture and in the media. The attitudes and mentalities found in culture and in the media are generated and passed on through communication. Therefore communication, often through the media, is what teaches a person in society how to act male or act female. Media influences and reinforces the idea of The Beauty Myth as discussed in Naomi Wolf's book, The Beauty Myth: How Images of Beauty Are Used Against Women, which refers to unrealistic standards of beauty for women.Wolf, Naomi. The Beauty Myth: how images of beauty are used against women. N.p.: Perennial, 2002. Print. Some argue that the mainstream media perpetuates the idea of hetero-masculinity by portraying men as dominant.Kimmel, Michael. Guyland: The Perilous World Where Boys Become Men . New York : HarperCollins, 2008. Some also argue that the media objectifies and oppresses women, and men who don't fall into the heteronormative category.Bordo, S. (1999). \\"Never Just Pictures\\" in Twilight Zones: The Hidden Life of Cultural Images from Plato to O.J. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press. = Oppression = Through the media, men are taught to be ultra-masculine by being desensitized, violent, and physically strong.Katz, J. (2002) 8 Reasons Why Eminem's Popularity is a Disaster for Women. Other forms of media that often portray the ultra-masculine figure are advertisements, specifically beer commercials. These forms encourage men to oppress other men if they do not fit the ideals of heteromasculinity.Strate, L. (2004) \\"Beer Commercials: A manual for masculinity\\" in Kimmel, M. S., & Messner (Eds.), M. A. Men's Lives (6th ed.).

This can be examined in the context of advertisements, where objects may be anthropomorphized and given feminine qualities or aspects of the female form. Some studies indicate that widespread objectification of women in the media may have significant repercussions on society, such as low self-esteem and/or eating disorders among women.Greening, Kacey D. \\"The Objectification and Dismemberment of Women in the Media.\\" Undergraduate Research Journal for the Human Sciences (2004): n. pag. URC. Web. 8 Nov. 2011. . Gender and socialization Socialization is the process where individuals learn the norms, values, and rules of a society in order to become a functioning member in it. Socialization theory offers a straightforward account of the acquisition of gendered identities. Infants are seen as blank slates, waiting to be written down on by their environment. Through their interactions with people close to them and exposure to the values of their society, infants learn what sex is attributed to them and what roles they are expected to learn. Reinforcement (through rewarding gender- appropriate behavior and punishing what may seem as deviant behavior) socializes children into their genders. For children, the primary agent of socialization for them is their parents. At a young age, children are taught societal rules and norms for specific genders. These norms, also known as gender roles, outline what is expected from males and females. From the moment of birth and on wards, parental expectations for their child are set by their gender. For example, are far more likely to engage with their sons in rough physical play than they are with their daughters, and it has been argued that long-term consequences may follow (in this case, a head start for boys in the development of physical violence and aggressiveness.) Parents and family can influence the way that a child develops their view of gender. These types of influences can include parental attitudes and difference of treatment regarding male and female children. Researcher Susan Witt claims that parents also expose children to gender from the time they are born via specific toys, colors, and names associated with genders in the binary. Witt suggests that parental attitudes about gender can differ from male to female children and that these attitudes develop quickly after a child's birth. Parents influence the way children behave and think at home, which is then carried out into the real world where the child is exposed to an environment that reinforces such ideas and beliefs. Author Susan Grieshaber, in \\"Constructing the Gendered Infant\\", suggests that attitudes regarding pregnancy change after parents find out the sex of their child, subsequently changing parental attitudes towards the unborn child. According to Grieshaber's theory, once parents determine the sex of their unborn child, they assume a gender while planning for the child's arrival. Because of this, Grieshaber claims that infants are born into a gendered world where they never know anything other than the gender traits that are assumed due to their sex. Dr. Kara Smith utilizes similar theory throughout the analysis of her pregnancy journals kept throughout her second pregnancy. Smith concluded that her attitude towards her child changed after learning that her child's sex was male. Smith's claim is reflected in changes in tone of voice when talking to the unborn child as well as differences in physical touch of her stomach throughout the rest of her pregnancy. Another theory of gender socialization, discussed by Susan McHale, is that the gender roles and attitudes of older siblings can impact the gender roles adopted by younger children. Throughout the findings of McHale's study, it is maintained that parents still have the most familial influence on childhood socialization. By the time children reach the age of three, many will have acquired a firm sense of themselves as male or female, a gender identity that remains throughout life. In addition, many pre-schoolers develop a firm awareness of gender stereotypes, insisting that certain activities or items of clothing are not for girls and others not for boys. Yet gender identity does not automatically follow from biological sex. Adults respond differently to communicative efforts of boys and girls. A study of infants aged 13 months found that when boys demand attention - by behaving aggressively, or crying, whining or screaming - they tended to get it. By contrast, adults tended to respond to girls only when they used language, gestures, or gentle touches; girls who used attention-seeking techniques were likely ignored. There was little difference in the communicative patterns at the start of the study, but by the age of two, the girls have become more talkative and boys more assertive in their communicative techniques. The norms that are taught throughout childhood are influential in an individual's life because the ideas about gender that are typically taught by parents in early years are reinforced outside of the home. A study done by Dr. Mick Cunningham states that the normative behaviors and attitudes that children observe can influence the way that these children grow up to structure their own households in adulthood. Normative gender roles can be reinforced outside of the household, adding power to these hegemonic ideas about gender. An analysis of children's books in the twenty-first century, by Janice McCabe, suggests that this particular avenue of children's media symbolically annihilates females, representing them about half as often as that of males. Underrepresentation such as this can affect children and their views of gender. Children's TV networks, such as Disney, Nickelodeon, and Cartoon Network have demonstrated a disproportional representation of males and females on their respective shows in a study done by Beth Hentges and Kim Case. According to Hentges and Case, there are less female characters across all three children's networks; however, there is more propagation of stereotypical gendered behavior on Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon than that of Disney. = Atypical Household Influence on Gender Socialization = Some children are raised in atypical households that challenge normative gender roles. In Jada Tidwell's study, she observes the play of children who come from households with lesbian feminist mothers (both single mothers and couples). Tidwell's observations consisted of both individual play as well as play integrated with the mothers. As a result of these observations, Tidwell asserts that atypical environments can affect children's lives and ideas. According to Tidwell, households that challenge hegemonic cultural ideas ultimately give children a different perspective of gender than those of children raised in heterosexual, two parent households. In the families studied by Jada Tidwell, children reported ideas that both endorsed and challenged stereotypical gender roles at times.Tidwell, Jada Annette. “Gender Development in Children with Atypical Parental Socialization: An Example of Lesbian Feminist Mothers.” Georgia State University, US: ProQuest Information & Learning, 2002. In a different study, Abbie Goldberg observed toddlers from various types of households and how these children engaged in play. Goldberg's findings suggest that children whose parents are of the same gender tend to play in ways that are less adherent to stereotypical gender roles than children from heterosexual households. Susan Witt, in her article “Parental Influence on Children's Socialization to Gender Roles’, advocates for androgynous gender roles in parenting, arguing that environments are more open minded about gender and encouraging to both their sons and daughters. Gender and psychoanalysis One of the most influential of the psychoanalytic theories of gender identity is the perspective developed in the book The Reproduction of Mothering. Its author, Nancy Chodorow, traces the implications for emotional development by linking them with the way mothers usually care for their infants in their formative years, while fathers are more emotionally distant. The development of an identity takes place as the infant gets more and more separated from his/her mother, with whom the infant is initially psychically merged. This process however operates differently for boys and girls. Girls can separate gradually, maintain a continuous sense of relationship with the mother, who is after all experienced as alike. For boys, on the other hand, separating from the mother, who is experienced as different, involves repressing the feminine aspects of themselves and rejecting their tenderness that was central to that early relationship. Boys' sense of maleness, according to Chodorow, is achieved at a great emotional cost.Chodorow, N. (1978). The Reproduction of Mothering, Berkeley, CA, and London, University of California Press Consequently, men grow up to have a more autonomous sense of self, and to be more independent, more instrumental and competitive in their dealings with others. They are also more likely to have difficulty expressing their emotions and to be anxious about intimacy. Women, on the other hand, have more ability and more need to sustain relationship with others.; they have greater empathy with others. They have difficulty however in maintaining the boundaries of an independent and autonomous self. Chodorow however believes that these patterns aren't inevitable. Changes in the social arrangements for care of children such as dual parenting, which would involve fathers in emotional intimacy with their children, can break the cycle. Gender and the division of labor Before industrialization, economic activity, which centered around agricultural work, crafts and so on, was organized by households. Household members, whether male or female, young or old, contributed to the family's livelihood. Although women might do some types of work and men others, depending on region and class, the distinction between men as breadwinners and women as housewives didn't characterize pre-industrial divisions of labor. Industrialization shifted much productive activity to factories, shops and offices. This separation of work from home signaled a profound change in gender relations and gender discourse. The home came to be understood not as the site of a family enterprise, but as a refuge from the world of work. Women were defined as the keepers of the home, as it was seen as their nature to create harmony and virtue rather than services and goods. Preindustrial society relied on gendered roles in the workforce to create equilibrium between men and women. Men were assigned the hunter role while women were assigned the domestic roles. Men were expected to supply food and shelter for the family while women were the caretakers for the children and their household. As centuries passed, this continued and created a divide in gendered roles in labor. Women remained dependent on men to provide, this dependence led to male roles being more valued in society which still remains in the 21st century. The divisions of labor ensures people with specific skill sets end up in certain jobs in order to benefit society. Where women fit into the workforce and how women benefit society were impacted by differences between the gender stereotypes of men and women. Based on stereotypes, males are perceived to be more suitable for the highest positions while women are not. Women are believed to lack the qualities needed to obtain male dominated occupations like management and CEO positions. Despite the greater number of women entering the workforce in recent years, men continue to dominate the workforce and women are still viewed as inferior.Conley, Dalton. You May Ask Yourself: an Introduction to Thinking like a Sociologist. 5th ed., W.W. Norton, 2019. With the constant negative perceptions of women in traditionally male occupations, research has shown that women approach tasks that are assumed to be for males with low confidence and self-esteem. This is due to the belief that they aren't competent enough to complete such tasks. However, Title VII and the 1964 Civil Rights Act were passed to attempt to ensure the equal treatment of the growing number of women entering the workforce.Conley, Dalton. You May Ask Yourself: an Introduction to Thinking like a Sociologist. 5th ed., W.W. Norton, 2019. However women are still subjected to forms of sexual harassment, which ranges form jokes to threats. The most common form of sexual harassment is “hostile environments” which aims to make women feel unsafe and uncomfortable. This sexual harassment serves as a means of men enforcing their superiority over women, and it is one of the most prominent forms of gender inequality in the workplace Gender in conversation Some research has found that, in classroom settings, male students tend to talk more, and longer, than female students. This was determined to be particularly noticeable when the instructor is male. Similar results were found previously in hospitals by Erving Goffman in 1961, university discussion groups by Elizabeth Aries in 1972, and in corporate settings by Rosabeth Kanter in 1977. = Gender in the workplace = Women and men experience different types of mobility within the workplace. For example, women tend to experience a glass ceiling, an invisible barrier that prevents them from moving up the corporate ladder. An example of this is a study from Sweden that compared the number of females in director jobs to men in director jobs. The study showed that there were statistically more men than women holding those jobs and showed that the results were also shown in other countries such as the USA. Men in jobs traditionally held by women, such as nursing, elementary school teaching, and social work, experience a \\"glass escalator\\" effect in which they are able to quickly ascend the job hierarchy to become managers and principals.Williams, Christine L., \\"The Glass Escalator: The Hidden Advantages for Men in the \\"Female\\" Professions\\", Social Problems, 39(3), pp. 253-267 There also tends to be a gender pay gap between men and women, with women earning 77% as much as men. One cause of the gender pay gap may be due to occupational segregation, which pushes men and women towards gender-specific forms of employment, rather than pay discrimination. Another possible cause is the double burden, a phenomenon in which women perform most of the unpaid childcare and household work despite being otherwise employed for pay. A third possible cause is occupational sexism, one part of which favors men for promotions due to their traditional breadwinner status.Coltrane, Scott. 1997. Family Man: Fatherhood, Housework, and Gender Equity. Oxford University Press, USA The 2001 class action lawsuit, Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., charged Wal-Mart with sexist hiring and promotion practices. There were also studies done that showed that having women in higher paying positions would correlate to an increased chance of depressive symptoms. These studies talked about how the depression was caused by the negative social experiences at their job, such as social isolation and negative social interactions, that weaken the mental health of the women in authority positions. Of which referenced that men had more value for their status in the work place than women. These social interactions would have been caused by cultural gender norms. Parallel to the social norms, women are stuck in the expectations placed upon them based on these norms. This places the identity of follower onto women since that is what the norm dictated. In China, women have experienced gender based discrimination based on job requirements that represent indirect discrimination. An example would be a job listing available to everyone but required the individual to be able to carry a set amount of weight or to be a certain height, without there being a need for that requirement in that job. These requirements prevent set groups from getting that job, but is labeled implicitly. In addition, the emergence of transgender individuals in the workplace has begun to disrupt the gender binary of male and female. By creating a hybrid gender identity, the transgender community suggests notions of movement toward postgenderism.  US Workplace  In the US, it is common for companies to adopt policies that allow women to be on maternity leave during and after pregnancy. As a result, there are many positive health benefits, such as better “overall maternal health, improving mother's mental health, [and] promoting mother-infant interaction”..Zagorsky, J. L. (2017). Divergent Trends in US Maternity and Paternity Leave, 1994-2015. American Journal of Public Health, 107(3), 460–465. https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2016.303607 However, the US is one of the few countries that do not allow women to be on paid maternity leave after giving birth. This leads to negative outcomes since many families can not live off of a single income. On the other hand, US policies maternity policies lack focus on males and do not include paternity leave. Between 1995-2005, about 13,000 males on average were on paternity leave compared to 273,000 women.Petts, R. J. ( 1 ), Knoester, C. ( 2 ), & Waldfogel, J. ( 3 ). (n.d.). Fathers’ Paternity Leave-Taking and Children's Perceptions of Father-Child Relationships in the United States. Sex Roles. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11199-019-01050-y Despite the low number of male workers on paternity leave, it has a wide range of benefits for the household. Some of which include “assisting mothers in their childbirth recovery…[and] encouraging father involvement”. Countries such as Canada and Sweden, which offer paternity leave, have lower infant mortality and better maternal health (both mental and physical). These countries also demonstrate how paternity leave is economically possible.Deahl, Jessica. “Countries Around The World Beat The U.S. On Paid Parental Leave.” NPR, NPR, 6 Oct. 2016, www.npr.org/2016/10/06/495839588/countries-around-the-world-beat-the-u-s-on- paid-parental-leave. However, there is an existing perception in society that discourages male workers to take paternity leave. Society's norms of traditional masculinity believes that males should prioritize work over family life, which is deemed a job for women. Together the lack of policies encouraging paternity leave, and society's notion that men should remain in the workplace, aim to discourage fathers' involvement in their young children and to enforce the traditional gender roles.  Intersectionality  Intersectionality is a Neo-Marxist concept stemming from a critical theory social analysis of class, race, and gender. The theory of intersectionality argues that forms of \\"inequality, oppression, and privilege\\" are shaped by interconnected axes of identity, and are mutually reinforced by social interactions and by social, political, and economic structures, such as capitalism, patriarchy, and institutionalized heteronormativity. The theory of Intersectionality argues that race, class, gender, and other markers of identity are social constructions. This theory argues against the assumption that systems of power relations are normative and can hold individuals accountable for their own character and efforts. West & Fenstermaker in their 1995 article Doing Difference offer that models that conceive gender, race and class as distinct axes are highly limiting in their understanding of the whole experience or identity of an individual. For example, they critique the additive model, in which the whole will never be greater (or lesser) than the sum of it parts. By analyzing each identity marker as an individual characteristic, we ignore the effect of the interconnection of these markers. Additional sociologists have written about the intersectionality of class, race, and gender. Joan Acker outlines four gendered processes of intersectionality. The first includes procedures that create hierarchies based on gender and race. Another is the process in which social images and ideas condone gendered institutions. The third is a process of interaction between individuals and groups that, through communication, creates gender. The fourth is the internal labeling of the self and others to gendered personas. Evelyn Nakano Glenn critiques both the patriarchy model of gender, which ignores racial differences among oppressed women, and the internal colonialism model, which focuses on minority populations in general, ignoring gender differences. Embodiment Embodiment may be defined as the ways in which cultural ideals of gender in a given society create expectations for and influence the form of our bodies. There is a bidirectional relationship between biology and culture; by embodying societally determined gender roles we reinforce cultural ideals and simultaneously shape, both temporarily and permanently, our bodies, which then perpetuates the cultural ideal.Connel, Raewyn 2002. Gender: Short Introductions. Malden: Blackwell Publishers, Inc. While there is actually more variation in body type within the male and female sexes than there is between the two sexes, embodiment exaggerates the perceived bodily differences between gender categories.Kimmel, Michael S. 2011. The Gendered Society. New York: Oxford Press. Social embodiment, for both men and women, is variable across cultures and over time. Examples of women embodying gender norms across cultures include foot binding practices in Chinese culture, neck rings in African and Asian cultures, and corsets in Western cultures. Another interesting phenomenon has been the practice of wearing high heels, which shifted from a masculine fashion to a feminine fashion over time. In the United States, the ideal body image and dimensions have changed for both women and men, with the body ideal female body shape becoming progressively slimmer and the body ideal for men becoming progressively larger.Bordo, Susan. 1999. \\"Never Just Pictures\\" in Twilight Zones: The Hidden Life of Cultural Images from Plato to O.J. University of California Press, pp. 107-138. These differences are epitomized in the example of children's toys; G.I. Joe dolls depict the physical ideals for boys and Barbie dolls embody the ideals for girls. The Beauty Myth, as discussed in Naomi Wolf's book The Beauty Myth: How Images of Beauty Are Used Against Women, refers to the unattainable standard of beauty for women, which sustains consumer culture. In contrast, men's bodies are also \\"dictated\\" by cultural ideals of gender, as is evident in consumer culture—especially beer commercials—in which men are portrayed as outdoorsy, tough, strong, and \\"manly.\\" Sexuality Sexuality encompasses both sexual behavior and sexual desire.Schwartz, Pepper, and Virginia Rutter. 1998. The Gender of Sexuality. Thousand Oaks: Pine Forge Press. However, Heteronormativity structures social life so that Heterosexuality is always assumed, expected, ordinary and privileged. Its pervasiveness makes it difficult for people to imagine other ways of life. Mass media works to glorify heterosexuality, which in turn lends to its pervasiveness and to its power. Both ordinary and exceptional constructions of heterosexuality work to normalize heterosexuality; thus, it becomes difficult to imagine anything other than this form of social relationship or anyone outside of these bonds. There is a common perception of heterosexuality as the \\"natural\\" emotional and sensual inclination for Human sexuality. Furthermore, marital heterosexuality occupies the largely invisible core of normative and desirable sexuality, while all other sexualities are marginalized and considered perverse and unnatural. Alfred Kinsey created a Heterosexual-Homosexual Rating Scale called the Kinsey Scale, which challenges the common perception of Human sexuality as strictly binary and directly linked to Gender. Drag queens are an example of \\"troubling\\" gender, complicating the understanding of sexuality in our society by causing people to think outside the binary of male/female.Goodwin, J. and Jasper, J.M. (eds). The Contexts Reader. New York: W.W. Norton, 2008. Pp. 247-253. Friedrich Engels argued that in hunter-gatherer societies the activities of men and women, although different, had the same importance. As technological advances let to productive surplus, social equality and communal sharing gave way to private property and ultimately class hierarchy. With the rise of agriculture, men gained significant power over women. With surplus wealth to pass on to their heirs, upper class men wanted to ensure their sons were indeed theirs, which led them to control the sexuality of women. The desire to control property brought about monogamous marriage and family. Women were taught to remain virgins until marriage and remain faithful to their husbands thereafter, and to build their lives around bearing and raising one man's children. Masculinity Masculinity is a performed gender identity. Contrary to popular perception, it is not the same as sex or sexual orientation. The contents and practices of masculinity are socially constructed and reproduced through daily interaction, especially on a more micro scale. Pdf. Theorists West & Zimmerman emphasized that gender is maintained through accountability. Men are expected to perform masculinity to the point that it is naturalized. Thus, a man's status depends on his performance. It is important to note, however, that masculinity can be performed by any sex. The dominant form of masculinity in a society is known as hegemonic masculinity. Men are constantly performing this to prove their status as men. Pdf. It is not really possible to reach it, especially as peers are in constant surveillance of each other, looking for flaws in their performance. Hegemonic masculinity is constructed in opposition to femininity and is dominant to all other gender identities (including alternative masculinities). Men are socialized from birth to perform it, especially through behavior and symbolism. One of the prominent behaviors is aggression in order to protect one's reputation. An example of symbols used would be clothing. Sociologist Michael Kimmel describes three cultures that support masculinity (especially in young men) in his 2008 book, Guyland: * The Culture of Entitlement: Men are raised to feel they deserve something. They feel entitled to power, sex and women. * The Culture of Silence: Men are not to talk to outsiders (those not embedded in the cultures of masculinity) about drinking, bullying, rape, or any performance of masculinity by their peers that they may get in trouble for. If they do talk, they will be seen as unmanly traitors. * The Culture of Protection: Communities do not hold men responsible for questionable and illegal actions. Many turn a blind eye, assuming their boys would never do that. Others write off dangerous acts as \\"boys will be boys\\". Some of the prominent attitudes and behaviors of western hegemonic masculinity are: power, sexual dominance and activity, wealth, aggression, independence, and lack of emotion. Less extreme sexual harassment is often seen as normal behavior. Exemplifying control theory, the norms of masculinity are so rigidly ingrained that men find little room to escape and end up constantly reproducing them. Hegemonic masculinity is often reproduced and reinforced through media and culture. \\"Media representations of men…often glorify men's use of physical force, a daring demeanor, virility, and emotional distance.\\" Contemporary rap music is a striking example of masculinity on display. Rappers boast about their sexual conquests of women (emphasizing heterosexuality as well), wealth, power and violence. Pdf. Gender and violence Gender-based violence is the physical, sexual or emotional harm or suffering enacted upon an individual as contextualized by societal gender norms. Violence affects the lives of millions worldwide, in all socio-economic and educational classes. It cuts across cultural and religious barriers, impeding the right of many to participate fully in society. Violence is about power, control, and domination. Systems of inequality and oppression interact positioning certain groups as particularly vulnerable to violence. Gendered violence takes place within a socially constructed power dynamic in which one ideology (masculinity) dominates another (femininity). What it means to be a woman in society is influenced and ascribed by the media, which acts a \\"powerful educational force\\". The media glamorizes violence against women cultivating a \\"toxic cultural environment\\" in which women are institutionally positioned as inferior and worthy objects of violence.Killing Us Softly 3: Advertising's Image of Women. Dir. Jean Kilbourne. Perf., 2000. DVD. Men are disproportionally the offenders, and women disproportionally the victims. Those that commit violent crimes are overwhelmingly male—rape (98%), armed robbery (92%), drunk driving (90%), murder (88%), aggravated assault (87%), arson (86%), and family violence (83%).Kimmel, Michael S. 2011. The Gendered Society. New York: Oxford Press. According to Michael Kimmel, hegemonic masculinity creates a culture of entitlement, silence, and protection, which effectively normalizes violence against women and silences victims of violence.Kimmel, Michael S. Guyland: the Perilous World Where Boys Become Men. New York: Harpercollins, 2009. Print. The Declaration on the Elimination of Violence defines three social arenas in which violence commonly takes place (1) in the family—including domestic violence, infanticide, and traditional practices such as female genital mutilation, foot binding, and bride burning; (2) in the community—including rape, sexual assault, sexual harassment, and commercialized violence such as sexual slavery, labor exploitation, female migrant workers; and (3) by the State—including violence against women in detention, and in situations of armed conflict such as systematic war rape.\\"Women and Violence.\\" Welcome to the United Nations: It's Your World. N.p., n.d. Web. 26 Nov. 2011. . In order to address and end gendered violence, solutions must address both the root causes and interpersonal manifestations of gender roles and power relations in order to ensure a balance of power at all levels of society. Globalization and gender Globalization refers to the increasingly global relationships of culture, people and economic activity. Globalization impacts female equality on a large and international scale, both negatively and positively. With continuous changes in international relations, the perception of feminism in Western and Nonwestern societies is frequently revised. It is important to be wary of Western bias in sociological accounts of global feminism, as Modern Western society is not always due credit for feminist reform in other cultures and countries.Ferree, Myra Marx. 2006. \\"Globalization and Feminism: Opportunities and Obstacles for Activism in the Global Arena\\" in Ferree, M.M. & Tripp, A.M. (Eds.) Global Feminism: Transnational women's activism, organizing, and human rights. New York: New York University Press. Feminist sentiments – or a push for gender equality – emerge as a result of the nation- specific circumstances, not according to the exported beliefs of Western society. Advances in female equality and status are often not the result of national groups or corporations, but of individuals and small groups. One of the results of globalization is the increased use of female factory workers in nonwestern countries. In Mexico, the female worker is ideal because she is seen as docile and inexpensive labor. Stereotypical feminine traits such as beauty, domesticity, and docility are exaggerated and exploited for the production of goods.Salzinger, L. 2003. Genders in Production: Making Workers in Mexico's Global Factories. Berkeley: University of California Press These gender traits then frame the behavior of the women beyond the occupational realm. Despite increasing feminism, the lack of economic and social mobility prevents women in many nations from having equal status in society. One of the solutions to erasing gender inequalities globally, is to provide resources and funds to impoverished women who will in turn use them for education as well as business ventures. The global economy could benefit drastically from incorporating educated women into the workforce.  Third gender  Throughout history, and around the world, the idea of a third gender has existed. In Native American culture, the two spiririt had gender roles different from men and women. More specifically, in Navajo society, the third gender is known as nadle. Nadle is a gender that does tasks commonly for both men and women, but also dresses according to whatever task they are doing at the moment. The muxe of southern Mexico are males who identify as neither male or female. In Samoa the Fa'afafine are biological males who identify as females. In Indian society, the hijra are biological males who identify as women. They give up sexual desires and participating in sexual practices by sacrificial emasculation, or the removal of the testicles and penis. They are considered outsiders in their communities and have formed their own language. In the United States, the concept of a third gender is beginning to gain traction. California now allows for drivers licenses to have the gender \\"non-binary\\", see genderqueer.

In 1903, the Chicago and North Western Railway (CNW) acquired the FE&MV; & continued to operate the line until 1982, when the section from Fremont to Norfolk (known by C&NW; as the West Point Subdivision) was abandoned after flooding along the Elkhorn River damaged the section. From the mid-1970s until the abandonment in 1982, freight traffic volumes had been mildly declining along this stretch of the Cowboy Line. The museum acquired the Fremont to West Point section in 1985. Inaugurated on Memorial Day 1986 as an excursion line for the summer months, the trains were powered by 2-8-0 #1702, a 1942 steam locomotive built by Baldwin Locomotive Works. A back-up locomotive, EMD SW1200, Soo Line 2121, was used until 1996. Since then the motive power was FEVR 1219 (née CNW 1219, CNW 319) another EMD SW1200, built in 1962. In 2010, after foreclosure was threatened on a bank loan, the Nebraska Railroad Museum sold the rail line to a private party out of Richmond, Missouri, in a deal that also included the museum's locomotives. The museum planned to continue to operate its dinner train on the line, renamed the Fremont Northern Railroad, through a lease agreement, but the train was discontinued in 2012 after deteriorating rail conditions jeopardized safety and promised repairs were not made. A FEVR train can be seen in the 1995 film To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar. Overall history The Eastern Nebraska Chapter of the National Railway Historical Society (now known as Nebraska Railroad Museum) was chartered in 1983, to preserve the abandoned railroad line running between Fremont & Norfolk. Before the FEVR, the track was operated by the Chicago & North Western north to Norfolk, which was a major hub (at that time) on their western division. Traffic volumes on this stretch of the cowboy line began mildly declining in the mid-1970s & abandonment was beginning to be discussed. In the spring of 1982, the declining freight traffic levels were combined with flooding along the Elkhorn River across Northeastern Nebraska. After the flooding occurred, the C&NW; promptly filed a request with the Surface Transportation Board to abandon the line & was granted permission a short while later. The 1982 abandonment left the track with a very dismal future. By October 1984, the Eastern Nebraska Chapter NRHS began negotiations to purchase the abandoned line. After many months of negotiation, the line was purchased from Fremont to West Point in summer 1985, giving birth to the Fremont & Elkhorn Valley Railroad. After the acquisition of the line, repairs were started immediately. Memorial Day 1986, FEVR ran the first train to Nickerson. Originally, the FEVR operated out of the old C&NW; freight house in Fremont. By Independence Day, trains were run to Hooper. New Year's Eve seen the inauguration of the Pathfinder Dinner Train over the FEVR line. In 1987, FEVR was evicted from the downtown freight house, relocating to a newly acquired property on Somers Avenue. In 1988, the Pathfinder Dinner Train left the FEVR rails, its whereabouts were unknown after that. A short time later, the section from Hooper to West Point was deemed too costly to repair. That section of the FEVR track was removed in summer of that year. Only a few months later, the newly formed Fremont Dinner Train began operations. Summer 1989 seen a new paint scheme applied to much of the equipment. Locomotive 1219 & a few pieces of the rolling stock were painted in the maroon, yellow & black colors. These colors were chosen to replicate the Fremont, Elkhorn & Missouri Valley railroad, which was the grand predecessor to the FEVR. Throughout 2000 & 2001, FEVR was contracted by American Car & Foundry to do seasonal car storage. Small strings of empty covered hoppers & tankers were brought in by the Union Pacific & stored on FEVR rails west of Hooper. By 2003, the FEVR slowly fell into decline. A bridge north of Nickerson was deemed unsafe to cross & the tracks north of the bridge to Hooper were embargoed. Union Pacific embargoed the connection track in 2004 after an interchange agreement with the Fremont North Western Railroad (private entity using FEVR track) fell through. The worst was yet to come. In 2010, foreclosure was threatened on a bank loan & many of the FEVR assets were sold to a private party out of Richmond, Missouri. After promised repairs were not made, FEVR operations were suspended in October 2012. The Fremont Dinner Train ceased operations then & moved to Baldwin City, Kansas (now known as the Kansas Belle Dinner Train). FEVR operations were suspended until repairs could be made. To date (2019), repairs have still yet to be made. Roster of equipment *EMD SW1200 #1219: a diesel-electric switcher locomotive built in March 1962; acquired by FEVR in early 1988.

Route details The tracks ridden by FEVR trains were laid in 1869-71 by the Fremont, Elkhorn and Missouri Valley Railroad (FE&MV;); it is one of the oldest sections of existing railroad track in the state of Nebraska. This line was nicknamed the \\"Cowboy Line.\\" In its general north-south route, the tracks cross the 1848 Mormon Trail on its way west to Salt Lake City, Utah. The FE&MV; was acquired by the Chicago and North Western Railway in 1903 and became a gateway to Chadron in northwest Nebraska, where the tracks then lead north to Deadwood and Rapid City, South Dakota, then on to Colony, Wyoming. From Chadron, the tracks leading west terminate in Lander, Wyoming. This section of the cowboy line was known as the West Point Subdivision during C&NW; ownership (according to a 1980 system timetable). The West Point subdivision track ran from Fremont to Norfolk. This line mainly hauled grain, agricultural goods, bentonite from South Dakota & occasional coal loads from the booming coal fields of Wyoming. By the mid 1970s, freight traffic levels began mildly declining & abandonment rumors became emminet through the early 1980s. However, along with the declining freight traffic volumes, flooding damaged many sections of the West Point subdivision in spring of 1982 & abandonment was applied for. C&NW; was granted permission to abandon the track later that year. The abandonment left the future of the track very dismal. The remaining section from Fremont to West Point was acquired by FEVR in 1985 & repairs to the track commenced. After 4 years of inactivity on the track, excursion operations were inaugurated by Steam Locomotive #1702 on Memorial Day 1986. When FEVR started out, it was originally planned out to acquire the entire line from Fremont to Norfolk. However, the plan never came to fruition as C&NW; had already removed the section of the track from West Point to Norfolk in Spring 1985, leaving West Point as the end of the track. Unfortunately, the line from Hooper to West Point was deemed too costly to repair. In summer 1988, this section of the FEVR track was removed, leaving the termination of the current system at Hooper. The section between Nickerson and Hooper was embargoed in 2003, due to a faulty bridge north of Nickerson. Now the line goes from Fremont to Nickerson, passing the historic Rawhide Creek on the line. Between Fremont and the village of Nickerson, a 'track'-diamond intersection exists in the BNSF Railway's Sioux City subdivision which was constructed by the C.B. & Q Railroad. This diamond was removed in the spring of 2014 by the BNSF Railway. South of Linden Avenue, the FEVR interchanges with Union Pacific Railroad (UP), which owns the connection line from M Street to Linden Avenue. The connection line is currently out of service, with trees growing on the right- of-way, ties needing replacement, and other repairs necessary. FEVR had been interested in acquiring the track for a number of years. In early June 2015, the railroad's crossings over State and Federal Highways were marked \\"Exempt\\", with crossing signals and warning devices bagged, and crossing gates removed. These crossings include Broad Street north of 23rd Street in Fremont (US Highway 77), US Highway 30 / 275 west of Luther Road north of Fremont, Nebraska Highway 91 in Nickerson, Nebraska and US Highway 77 at Winslow, Nebraska. November 2016 seen 2 more crossings removed. The crossing ownership at Linden Avenue changed to UP & was removed as well as the UP crossing at Military Avenue. Fremont Dinner Train The Fremont Dinner Train was a privately owned dinner train for which FEVR provided track and locomotive with operating crews; it traveled on Friday and Saturday nights and Sunday afternoons. It began service on the FEVR track in October 1988, shortly after the Pathfinder Dinner Train left. The dinner train cars were built in the 1940s and '50s. Meals were catered rather than cooked on the train. The Fremont Dinner Train ceased operations in October 2012 and was moved to Baldwin City, Kansas (now known as the Kansas Belle Dinner Train).

It is 46 kilometres northeast of Winnipeg, just west of the Canadian Shield and Whiteshell Provincial Park. The French name means \\"beautiful stay\\". The town is surrounded by the Rural Municipality of Brokenhead. History In 1906, the \\"Manitoba Glass Works\\" was founded, in a town now known as Beausejour, by Joseph Keilback and his partners. Sustained by a nearby deposit of high quality sand, it was the first glass container factory in Western Canada. Glassblowers from Poland and the United States, supported by local labour, used silica sands to produce bottles for breweries and soft drink companies in Winnipeg. In 1909 it was taken over by a Winnipeg businessman, who expanded production to include jars, medicine bottles, and ink bottles. At its peak, the Manitoba Glass Works employed 350 workers, but because of its inability to compete with Eastern Canadian manufacturers, was purchased in 1913 by a Montreal company and relocated to Redcliff, Alberta. The factory site remains, and was designated as a Provincial Heritage Site (number 41) on 27 September 1989.Manitoba Provincial Heritage Sites In 1912, the Town of Beausejour was incorporated. It is the birthplace of former Provincial Premier and Governor General Edward Schreyer. Edward Schreyer School is named after him in his honour. Beausejour was the setting for the 1990 film The Outside Chance of Maximilian Glick, & its 1990-91 television dramedy series adaptation, Max Glick. The film was largely filmed there. Access Major highways servicing Beausejour are PTH 44 and PTH 12, which run concurrently north of town. From the south, Beausejour can be reached by traveling PTH 12 and Provincial Road 215 east into town or by taking PR 302. PTH 44, PR 215, and PR 302 intersect at the west side of town. Prior to the construction of the Trans-Canada Highway, PTH 44 was the main route from Winnipeg to the Ontario border. Economy Beausejour's current economy is based on agriculture (grain production) and tourism. Its location as a main access point to the Whiteshell Provincial Park, a popular cottage region and tourist attraction, allows Beausejour to cater to visitor traffic through the area. It also serves as the main commercial centre for farmers and residents of the surrounding areas. Notable people *Bob Davie (ice hockey), former NHL defenceman *Edward Schreyer, former Premier of Manitoba and Governor general of Canada Recreation The town is home to the Canadian Power Toboggan Championships, the Double B Agricultural Festival (formerly Double B Rodeo and Country Fair) and the annual Brokenhead River Agricultural Conference. Beausejour is also known for its annual \\"Shades of the Past\\" car show on the last Sunday of August. The car show encompasses all of Park Avenue and attracts over 500 classic and special interest vehicles. Beausejour has also hosted the 2011 Manitoba provincial men's curling championship (then known as the Safeway Championship) won by Jeff Stoughton (Charleswood), and two Manitoba provincial women's curling championships, Scott Tournament of Hearts, at the Sun Gro Centre. The 2004 Manitoba Scott Tournament of Hearts was won by Lois Fowler (Brandon, Wheat City Curling Club), while the 2016 Scotties Tournament of Hearts was won by Kerri Einarson (East St. Paul Curling Club), with Beausejour's Selena Kaatz playing third. Sports Beausejour hosted the 2006 Power Smart Manitoba Games. The opening ceremonies were held at the CPTC Racetrack, and the closing ceremonies at the Sun Gro Centre. Beausejour's hockey teams are known as the Blades. Beausejour's MEHL team is Beausejour Beavers. The Eastman Selects of the Manitoba Midget 'AAA' Hockey League plays in the town. Hockey games are played in the Sun Gro Centre, which also has a curling rink.Sun Gro Centre Media The Beausejour Review published its final issue on 27 June 2013. Climate Beausejour has a humid continental climate influenced by its far inland position in the higher mid-latitudes, resulting in warm and occasionally hot summers and frequently severely cold winters, with January average highs being below .

Johnson, 'Normandy and Norman Identity in Southern Italian Chronicles', Anglo Norman Studies, 27 (2005), pp.85-100, pp.95-6. He travelled to the southern Italian peninsula, passing some time in Apulia before entering the monastery of Sant'Agata at Catania, on the isle of Sicily. Malaterra indicates that, prior to his arrival in Catania, he had spent an undefined period away from monastic life, in the worldly service of \\"Martha\\".Gauffredo Malaterra, De rebus gestis rogerii siciliae et calabriae comitis et roberti guiscardi ducis fratris eius, ed. Ernesto Pontieri (Rome, 1927-8), p.3.  Background  Little is known of Geoffrey before he became a monk in Sicily. He writes in the dedication of his history that he previously served the clergy in some secular capacity, and that he came from \\"a region on the other side of the mountains,\\" which is generally seen as a reference to the Alps. While many historians have cited this as evidence for Geoffrey's Norman heritage and historians Ernesto Pontieri and Marjorie Chibnall have gone so far as to place him in the monastery of St. Evroul before his arrival in Italy. Kenneth Baxter Wolf argues that this is misguided and that Geoffrey could have come from many places in Europe. It is likely that he came to Sicily as part of Duke Roger's ecclesiastical rebuilding, and was placed at the monastery of St. Agatha, where he served under Abbot Angerius. Duke Roger at the Battle of Cerami (1061). Geoffrey came to Sicily following its conquest by Roger and his older brother, Robert Guiscard.  De rebus gestis Rogerii et Roberti  Malaterra wrote Latin history, the De Rebus Gestis Rogerii Calabriae et Siciliae Comitis et Roberti Guiscardi Ducis fratris eius,Gaufredo Malaterra, De Rebus Gestis Rogerii Calabriae et Siciliae Comitis et Roberti Guiscardi Ducis fratris eius, ed. Ernesto Pontieri, Rerum Italicarum Scriptores V pt.1 (Bologna, 1927-8). which chronicles the history of the Normans in Italy, particularly the brothers Robert Guiscard and Roger I of Sicily, and their conquest of Sicily. Geoffrey reports Pope Urban II's bull of 5 July 1098, which made Roger and his heirs legates of the Latin church, but not much after that. Additionally, he notes Bohemond's joining the First Crusade, but not the Fall of Jerusalem or Bohemond's conquest of Antioch. These details indicate that he probably finished his history around this time in 1098. Malaterra's work is one of the three surviving contemporaneous histories of the Norman conquest of Italy, the others being those of William of Apulia and Amatus of Montecassino. Malaterra's is significant because it is the only history to significantly cover the conquest of Sicily. It seems likely that Geoffrey was writing at the behest of Roger, who was an old man by this time and may have been looking to legitimize the claims of his heirs. Unlike other medieval historians, such as Dudo of Saint-Quentin, Malaterra does not directly identify his sources, and alludes briefly to a number of informants, or relatoribus. These may have included Roger I of Sicily, himself. The work ends in 1099 and provides many valuable details, especially of the conquest of Sicily, which are unattested elsewhere. It is unclear precisely when Malaterra started and finished work on the text. All of the events therein are recorded in the past tense and the author does not indicate any knowledge of the death of Roger I of Sicily in 1101. At present, the consensus is that it was started after the majority of the events related in the text had come to pass, and finished before Roger I of Sicily's death. A passing reference to the work in Orderic Vitalis's Historia Ecclesiastica confirms that the work had been completed and was in circulation, albeit across a small geographical area, by the 1130s.Orderic Vitalis, The Ecclesiastical History, ed. and trans. by Marjorie Chibnall, vol. 2 (Oxford, 1969), pp. xxii, 100-1.

The regiment's allegiance was to the British Crown until 1775, when the regiment was raised for service in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. \\"Jersey Blues\\" Although the unit had existed long beforehand, it was not until the mid-eighteenth century that the term \\"Jersey Blues\\" came into popular usage. The term \\"Jersey Blues\\" derives from the uniform adopted by the New Jersey provincial legislature for its troops, which were assigned to service under the British Crown Provincial Forces. The coats of these Jersey units were blue with red lapels and cuffs. The men also wore blue breeches or leggings and red waistcoats. (In some cases, sturdier buckskin or leather breeches were authorized.) The term \\"Jersey Blues\\" continued to be used well into the early nineteenth century in reference to the state's military units. The regiments of the Jersey Line during the American Revolution and those of the New Jersey Volunteers, raised for Federal service during the Civil War, adopted the term. It was actually even used by New Jersey's National Guard unit after WWII – 50TH Armored Division; as well as in 2008 when the N. J. Guard was sent to Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom – 50th Infantry Brigade Combat Team. That unit remains in existence to this date -2017. Service to the crown =King George's War= In 1744, during King George's War (1744–1748) the New Jersey legislature appropriated money and raised 500 volunteers to assist New York in capturing the French fort at Crown Point. Bad food, ill discipline and a mutiny resulted in the abandonment of the expedition, however. =The French and Indian War= During the French and Indian War (1755–1763) New Jersey's participation was remarkable, and a new resource (2007) \\"Colonial Tribulations\\" documents the service of the New Jersey Regiment (the \\"Jersey Blues\\") throughout that period. Just as in the previous colonial wars their existence began with the N. J. Assembly ordering the muster of 500 men to respond to the larger war looming on the New York frontier. Indian raids by tribes allied with the French along the colony's northwest border in the summer of 1755 also prompted the raising of a different unit known as the New Jersey Frontier Guard (not to be confused with the regular provincial or \\"Blues\\" regiment). The Frontier Guard responded to localized Indian incursions, as well as garrisoned the forts along the Delaware River. Contrastingly, in 1755 the entire contingent of 500 men known as the Jersey Blues was stationed at the lightly fortified trading village of Oswego, N.Y., where they constructed the first documented military hospital. They also assisted with improving the fortifications in order support the British offensive against French Fort Niagara which wound up bring delayed until 1756. During that following year only a part of the regiment had returned to the 'three' forts on Lake Ontario, and they were engaged in and bore the suffering of several skirmishes. However, in August the all out attack on their outpost by French commander the Marquis de Montcalm resulted in many Jerseymen becoming prisoners of war who experienced many documented tribulations. At least one NJ Indian is documented among the ranks. By 1757, the Jersey Blues were re-mustered and assigned to Fort William Henry where they comprised one third of its garrison. In July about 150 were taken as POWs while another 50 died during the battle of Sabbath Day Point on the northern part of Lake George. The 100 men who escaped that day returned to William Henry to join the 200 others who remained in garrison. A short few weeks later those 300 were again attacked by Montcalm which was immortalized in the book and movie \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\". Most in the general public have no idea that the Jersey troops were present or what they experienced. Importantly, the unit continued to include several Native Americans from the province who experienced harsh consequences following the fort's capitulation. In 1758, the unit was again re-mustered and engaged in the attack of French Fort Carillon, where Montcalm was able to repel a massive British force. Several Jersey Blues were killed in action. A part of the unit was later engaged in the successful taking of the strategic French outpost, Fort Frontenac, on Lake Ontario. By 1759, they were again on the N.Y. frontier, when a small party was ambushed by Indians allied with the French near Lake George of July 2, 1759. \\"16 of the Jersey Blues were sent without the camp to gather a little brush for the General's Baker, but were not an hour gone before they were surprised in sight of the camp by a party of the enemy, consisting of about 240, who killed and scalped six, wounded two, took four prisoners, and only four of the whole party escaped. They shewed themselves plainly to the whole Army after they got the scalps, gave a hollow, and then made off to their Battoes, which were not more than two miles from the Head of the Lake. A large party was ordered out after them, but in vain. They butchered our people in a most shocking manner, by cutting pieces of flesh out of their necks, thighs and legs\\" – New York Mercury The N.J. Historical Society stated that in 1760 the regiment was part of the final campaign against the French in Canada. Remarkably, one of the soldiers (a N. J. Native American) who was taken as a POW at Fort William Henry in '57 was reunited with the unit and returned home with them. By 1761, existing payroll accounts verify that the unit was indeed mustered, and by 1762 they had formed a part of the expedition against Havana, Cuba. There is also oral tradition that one of the cannons at the Old Barracks in Trenton, N. J. was a spoil of war for the Jersey Blues. Payroll accounts also verify that the unit remained activated through 1765. The Old Barracks Museum put forth a nice exhibit about the F & I War which includes rare artifacts of the Blues. The American Revolution The smoker, the drummer of the Jersey Blues by Théophile Lybaert The 1st New Jersey Regiment, which was known as part of the famed \\"Jersey Blues,\\" was authorized on October 9, 1775, by the Continental Congress to be raised for service with the Continental Army under the command of Colonel William Alexander, better known as Lord Stirling for his (unsuccessful) claims to that Scottish title. It was also known as \\"First or Eastern Battalion of Foot of New Jersey Troops\\" while the Second New Jersey, authorized at the same time, was raised in the western counties of provincial New Jersey. Eight companies of the 1st New Jersey were raised in Essex, Middlesex, Morris, Somerset, Monmouth, and Bergen counties. One of the first activities of the newly formed unit was subduing and capturing Tories on Long Island. After Stirling was elevated to the rank of general, command of the 1st New Jersey was given to Colonel William Winds. Winds suffered humiliation after pressing for the regiment to leave Fort Ticonderoga in November 1776 after enlistments for the Jerseymen expired. When the regiment was reorganized in January 1777 as the 1st New Jersey Regiment, Continental Line, command was first offered to Silas Newcomb, but he declined. Matthias Ogden, who had previously served as major and lieutenant colonel of the 1st NJ Battalion of 1775-1776, became regimental commander with the rank of colonel, a position he held virtually until the end of the war. The regiment saw action at the Battle of Valcour Island, Battle of Brandywine, Battle of Germantown, Battle of Monmouth, Sullivan Expedition, Battle of Springfield and the Battle of Yorktown. Other service included Winter Cantonment at Valley Forge (1776–1777), Battle of Short Hills (1777), Winter Cantonments at Morristown/Pompton Plains. The regiment was disbanded on November 3, 1783, at New Windsor, New York.Richard M.

It operated on a unique narrow gauge until the 1940s when standard gauge rails were laid. Service ceased in 1983 due to landslides. It is California Historical Landmark #842. History =Union Wharf companies= On December 15, 1854, the Union Wharf and Plank Walk Company built a pier into Humboldt Bay near Arcata to load lumber schooners. The wooden rails overlain with strap iron laid on that walkway were built to an unusual narrow gauge of apart. A year later, of track had been laid leading up to the wharf. A horse drew the cars across the narrow gauge rail tracks. This line was the oldest working railroad in California because while the Sacramento Valley Railroad filed papers of incorporation in 1853, they did not begin construction until 1855, after this line was operational. In 1875, the railroad was renamed the Union Plank Walk and Railroad Company. The wooden rails were faced with iron and a small steam locomotive, named the Black Diamond towed lumber out onto the pier from the 1872 Dolly Varden mill owned by Isaac Minor. =Arcata Transportation Company= Twenty-three years later, on June 15, 1878, the railroad was reorganized as the Arcata Transportation Company. The old side-wheel steamer, the Gussie McAlpine was replaced by a sternwheeler, named the Alta and the company kept adding track to local mills. In 1881 the Arcata and Mad River Railroad assumed control of the old line. Over the next two years, they replaced strap iron rail with T-rail and extended the rails further upstream on the Mad River until they reached the town of North Fork now Korbel and the Humboldt Lumber Mill owned by the Korbel brothers. Due to the initials of the line, it was nicknamed the \\"Annie and Mary.\\" =Arcata and Mad River Railroad Company= 1933 map showing the abandoned Minor RR line In 1883, the Korbel family bought the line which had about of track split between common carrier lines and private logging track. The Korbels organized the company on December 29, 1891, as the Arcata and Mad River Railroad Company. In the late 1880s, the A&MR; line carried lumber for the (Isaac) Minor Mill and Lumber Company of Glendale. In 1890, the A&MR; engines included Arcata, North Fork, Eureka and Blue Lake as well as a small engine named Gypsy; by the early 1900s, a new Baldwin 1901 engine named the Hoopa was added. In 1896 the line carried 24,752 passengers and of freight from four saw mills and two shingle mills. Passenger revenue on the line was about 28 percent of freight revenue. In March 1896 an E&ERRR; construction train failed to stop and collided with a passenger train. The first known Humboldt County railroad accident with injuries occurred on September 13, 1896, when seven people were killed and 23 injured by a train falling through the Mad River truss bridge. Lawsuits relating to the fatal accident were filed against the Korbels but were unsuccessful. Construction of the California and Northern Rail line between Arcata and Eureka in 1901 put the Alta out of business. Two years later the Humboldt Lumber Mill and the A&MR; were bought by the Riverside Lumber Company and the Charles Nelson Steamship Company who reinforced the wharf for use by any locomotive instead of just the lightweight engine formerly used. =20th century= Western portion of route as of 1942 with abandon tracks Eastern portion of line in 1945 After owner Francis Korbel returned to his home city of Prague, the company sold out to the Northern Redwood Lumber Company. On October 23, 1914, the region was linked to the San Francisco Bay Area for the first time by the completion of the Northwestern Pacific Railroad (NWP) which also assumed control of the California and Northern. The NWP consolidated about half of the Humboldt County rail lines. In 1925, the logging rail gauge and the Heisler locomotives were changed to , although the original narrow gauge remained until the closing of the Korbel Riverside mill rendered it redundant. The next series of changes resulted in removing old track and building new in the 1940s when all the old track was gone and standard gauge for was installed. On 3 June 1954 the railroad celebrated its centennial with an excursion for 300 Humboldt County residents plus 338 railfans from Oregon, Arizona, New Mexico, and distant parts of California. Locomotive number 12 pulled a baggage car and nine Southern Pacific San Francisco commuter coaches from Arcata to Korbel, where the passengers transferred to seven flatcars pulled by Shay locomotive number 5 to Camp 9. Lumber boomed again in the 1950s, the A&MR; served fifteen shippers on its railroad. In 1956 the Simpson Logging Company purchased the Northern Redwood Lumber Company operations, which included the A&MR.; The average daily car loadings were enough to place the road among the highest paying railroad properties per mile in the United States. At the time of its closure, AMR ran 4 General Electric 44-tonner diesel-electric locomotives (#101-#104) and one Whitcomb 80DE-7b 80 ton diesel-electric locomotive. During the 1950s, shipments from Blue Lake included regular cars from the Levitt Brothers own lumberyard and nail factory from which lumber and nails were sent to the four Levittown developments in the eastern U.S. A Brief History of Levittown, New York , Levittown Historical Society, retrieved 08 February 2013 In the winter of 1982–83, storms washed out the main NWP line in several places. After restoring service to Eureka in June 1983, the NWP charged a surcharge of $1,200 per car in and out of the area. Due to the landslides and the surcharges, shippers switched to diesel trucks, dooming the A&MR.; Service on the line ceased in 1983 and it the line was abandoned May 24, 1985. In September 1988 the Eureka Southern Railroad purchased the AMR from Simpson Timber Company for $300,000. Service on other parts of the system was briefly resumed in 1994 by the North Coast Railroad but ceased permanently after landslides led to the closure of the entire Humboldt County portion of their track in 1998. The Arcata and Mad River Railroad was last used in 1992; all fixtures were removed by 1998. A trail on the former right-of-way was proposed by the North Coast Rail Authority in 1997. Although little progress has been made on the trail, the Blue Lake Chamber of Commerce sponsors an annual parade celebrating the history of the railroad.

The regiment would see action at the Battle of Trois- Rivières, Battle of Valcour Island, Battle of Brandywine, Battle of Germantown, Battle of Crooked Billet, Battle of Monmouth, Sullivan Expedition, Battle of Springfield and the Battle of Yorktown. The regiment was furloughed, on 6 June 1783, at Newburgh, New York, and disbanded 3 November 1783. History =1775-1776= On 9 October 1775, the 2nd NJ Battalion was authorized as part of the first establishment of the Continental Army. Originally New Jersey's contribution for 1776 was to be two battalions, but this was raised to three. From December 1775 to February 1776, the battalion was mustered and organized at Burlington and Trenton, to consist of eight companies from Gloucester, Hunterdon, Burlington, Salem, and Sussex counties. The men served under Colonel William \\"Scotch Willie\\" Maxwell for an enlistment of one year. From March to May 1776, the battalion was assigned to the Canadian Department, the regiment belatedly taking part in the investment of Quebec. The leading contingent arrived at the city on 25 March. The siege of Quebec ended on 5 May 1776. On 8 June 1776, after enduring the retreat from Quebec, the regiment took part in the ill-executed Battle of Trois-Rivières, Canada. From July to November 1776, the battalion took part in the retreat from Canada to Crown Point and then to Fort Ticonderoga, New York. The unit formed part of the garrison there until 13 November when they returned to New Jersey. In November 1776, with orders to reinforce Washington's army, the battalion marched to Morristown, New Jersey, where they arrived about 3 December and were disbanded when one-year enlistments expired. Many of the men reenlisted in the second establishment of the regiment for three-year enlistments. =1777-1778= The newly formed regiment headquartered in Burlington and then Princeton until 5 April, until it was ordered to join the main army under General Washington. On 22 May 1777, Maxwell's Jersey Brigade and Conway's Pennsylvania Brigade were ordered to form a division under Lord (General William Alexander) Stirling. The regiment was stationed through June 1777 in the area between Middlebrook (modern-day Metuchen) and Short Hills, keeping watch on, and occasionally skirmishing with, the enemy. On 26 June 1777, Stirling's Division was attacked at Short Hills by General William Howe's British and Hessian troops. After a sharp fight, the Americans retired to Middlebrook and rejoined the main army under Washington. A period of marching and countermarching ensued after the action at Short Hills. General Howe's forces sailed on board the British fleet on 24 July, their destination unknown. Unable to decide their objective, General Washington determined to cover all possibilities while waiting for news of the fleet. Stirling's Division moved from Middlebrook across the Hudson to Peekskill, New York, and then back south again into Pennsylvania. At their camp at \\"The Cross Roads\\", in Bucks County, news was finally received that the British were in the Chesapeake. On 11 September 1777, Israel Shreve's Regiment, along with the rest of the Jersey Brigade, took part in the Battle of Brandywine. Forced to move from their positions on the right of the army, along the creek, Stirling's Division marched to a hill near Birmingham Meeting House to counter a British flank attack. The three Continental divisions on the hill caught the full force of Howe's assault, which included the British Brigade of Guards, grenadiers, and light infantry. After an action of about 45 minutes, the defenders were forced to give way. With the army's right flank defeated, the battle was lost and the Americans retreated to Chester, Pennsylvania. During the fighting on Birmingham Hill, Colonel Israel Shreve was wounded in the thigh and did not return to duty until November. From September to October 1777, the army undertook a series of marches and maneuvers designed to cover both the magazine at Reading, Pennsylvania and the capital at Philadelphia. In spite of their efforts, the city fell to the British. On 4 October 1777, at the Battle of Germantown, Washington's army assaulted the British encamped outside of Philadelphia. Maxwell's Brigade formed part of the reserve and as such attacked the Chew House in which members of the British 40th Foot had barricaded themselves as the Continentals swept through town. After a series of futile assaults, the Jersey troops were forced to give up the attempt when the battle was lost and the Americans retreated. On 2 November 1777, the 2nd New Jersey Regiment arrived at Whitemarsh, Pennsylvania, with the rest of the Army. They remained there for six weeks. On 19 December 1777, Shreve's Regiment entered winter quarters at Valley Forge and stayed there until ordered, on 19 March 1778, to take post in Haddonfield, New Jersey. Through the spring of 1778, on detached duty and in cooperation with the Jersey Militia, the 2nd New Jersey gathered forage and supplies, and skirmished with the British and Loyalists for two months. At the end of May, the rest of Maxwell's Brigade joined them at Mount Holly. On 4 and 5 April 1778, British forces repulsed Major Richard Howell and his troops from Billingsport, New Jersey. British troops attacked Swedesboro and marched on towards Haddonfield. Col. Israel Shreve evacuated from Haddonfield about 2 am Sunday morning, 5 April, and speed marched his troops to Mount Holly. Haddonfield was attacked, two Quaker houses were burned, and American rider Miles Sage was stabbed multiple times by British (but survived). British troops proceeded to Cooper's Ferry (present site of the New Jersey access of the Benjamin Franklin Bridge). A pitched battle ensued, with about 50 American troops (most of whom were part of Shreve's Regiment), led by Major William Ellis (Gloucester Militia). Orders had been given by Shreve (and sent by Miles Sage) to vacate upon the ignition of an alarm cannon. The cannon was never fired, and Ellis refused to retreat across the Cooper Creek Bridge. Many men were wounded, killed or captured. The British were furious about the lost opportunity to capture Shreve at Haddonfield but elated about the capture of the American picket at Cooper's Ferry (including a set of spy glasses given by Washington to spy upon the Philadelphia shore). Washington was furious at Shreve and never forgave him. Through June 1778, the reunited Jersey Brigade kept watch on the British in Philadelphia in anticipation of their evacuation. On 28 June Maxwell's Brigade formed a part of Gen. Charles Lee's advance force in the opening phases of the Battle of Monmouth. Hampered by confused orders and heavy pressure from the British, Lee's troops retreated in disorder until they were met by the main army under Washington. The 2nd New Jersey covered the retreat of Lee's forces and fell back as reserves for the rest of the engagement. From June to December 1778, the Jersey Brigade was stationed in and around Elizabethtown, New Jersey, to cover the area and counter any British moves from New York through the summer and autumn. =1779-1783= From 16 December 1778 to 29 May 1779, the unit was ordered into winter quarters at or near Newark, New Jersey, where they remained until spring. At the end of May they marched to Easton, Pennsylvania, to join the expedition against the Iroquois, forming under Major General John Sullivan. From 18 June to October 1779, the 2nd Regiment took part in Sullivan's campaign to destroy the power of the Indian allies of the British. They marched through Pennsylvania and into western New York, burning villages and laying waste to crops. On 24 August General Sullivan's army left Tioga, Pennsylvania, leaving behind Colonel Israel Shreve and a mixed detachment to garrison a small work called Fort Sullivan. The remainder of the regiment marched north with the rest of the army. On 29 August a force of Iroquois and Loyalist troops attempted an ambush at Newtown (present-day Elmira, New York), but were defeated and driven from the field. Maxwell's Brigade was in the reserve during this action. The army returned to Easton on 15 October. On 17 December 1779, the brigade arrived at Eyre's Forge on the Hardscrabble Road, located between Jockey Hollow, Basking Ridge, and Vealtown (present-day Bernardsville, New Jersey). The Jersey regiments made this site their winter quarters, remaining there until April or May 1780. On 7 June 1780, the 2nd New Jersey took part in the Battle of Connecticut Farms, New Jersey. Colonel Shreve wrote that this \\"Action was the warmest that has Ever Happened since the war with Our Brigade.\\" From 8 to 22 June the brigade kept watch on British forces encamped behind their fortifications at Elizabethtown. On 23 June Shreve's Regiment saw action in the Battle of Springfield, which resulted in the retreat of the British army back to Elizabethtown. At midnight on the 23rd the enemy troops crossed back to Staten Island. From June to November 1780 the Jersey Brigade was situated at several posts to protect the New Jersey side of the Hudson from enemy incursions. In October they moved to West Point and entered barracks in anticipation of remaining there for the winter. The brigade also lost their long-time commander, William Maxwell, having resigned from service. Contrary to expectations the Jersey troops were ordered in November 1780 to take up winter quarters in and around Pompton, New Jersey. With the new year another change in command took place, with Israel Shreve resigning as colonel of the 2nd New Jersey and Colonel Elias Dayton assuming the post. From 20 to 27 January 1781, the men of the Jersey Brigade at Pompton mutinied to redress their grievances, in emulation of the Pennsylvania troops. The uprising was suppressed quickly with the execution of two of its leaders. In February, after the Pennsylvania Line mutiny, the New Jersey soldiers moved into the old Pennsylvania huts at Mount Kemble (Jockey Hollow). In the same month, two light companies and three battalion companies from the New Jersey line along with the light troops from New England were selected to form a detachment under the Marquis de Lafayette to serve in Virginia. In addition to other skirmishes during the spring and summer, these men saw action on 26 June 1781 at Spencer's Ordinary, near Williamsburg. They were reunited with the rest of the Jersey Brigade at Williamsburg in late September 1781. During the first six months of the year the two New Jersey regiments kept a large proportion of troops on detached duty, including one company on duty at Wyoming, Pennsylvania. Besides commanding the 2nd Regiment, Colonel Dayton had charge of the brigade, keeping his headquarters at Chatham, New Jersey. On 30 June Dayton was ordered to concentrate the whole brigade at Morristown, excepting the troops at Wyoming. On 30 June the brigade was ordered to march towards Kingsbridge, New York. They were then redirected towards Dobb's Ferry and remained in that vicinity until August. On 21 July the brigade was ordered to send a detachment of troops to Fort Lee, and on the 28th 150 New Jersey soldiers escorted General Washington as he reconnoitered the British positions at New York from the palisades at Fort Lee. On 29 August 1781, the Continental army left Springfield, New Jersey, bound for Virginia in an effort to trap British forces under Lord Cornwallis at Yorktown. On 2 September the American forces passed through Philadelphia on their way south; the following day the French army under General Rochambeau marched through the city. One of the places they passed, just south of the city, was the Blue Bell Inn on Cobbs Creek. There are a number of other witness sites along the route. On 5 September the French and British fleets battled for control of Chesapeake Bay. With the defeat of the British fleet the escape of Cornwallis' troops by sea was blocked. On 23 September 1781, the first contingent of New Jersey troops under General Washington landed near Williamsburg, at which place they joined the force under Lafayette. The siege of Lord Cornwallis' forces at Yorktown began on 29 September. On 14 October, at night, the Jersey Light Infantry under Lt. Colonel Francis Barber took part in the assault and capture of Redoubt Number 10. This was one of two important strongpoints taken, Redoubt Number 9 being captured by French troops. On 19 October, the capitulation of the British and German forces at Yorktown took place, the enemy troops surrendering their arms to the French and American armies. In December 1781 the New Jersey regiments \\"take Post somewhere in the Vicinity of Morristown\\" for their winter cantonment. The troops may have been housed once more in the old Pennsylvania Line huts at Mount Kemble. Through the first half of the year the Jersey regiments spent most of the time in small detachments doing duty as guards and picquets. On 29 August they left their huts and marched north to join the main army on the other side of the Hudson at King's Ferry, New York. Leaving Verplank's in October and traveling north, they marched from \\"Murderer's Creek\\" on the 29th a distance of \\"about five miles to our ground for hutting and encamped.\\" On 30 October General Washington wrote from Newburgh, New York, that the regiments of \\"New Jersey, are hutting in the Neighborhood of this place\\" it being \\"of Importance to the Health, care and comfort of the Troops, as well as economical on many Accounts, that they should be early put into Quarters for the Winter.\\" This, the last cantonment for the army, was located at New Windsor, New York. This last winter was relatively uneventful. Ebenezer Elmer, surgeon's mate and then surgeon to the 2nd New Jersey Regiment from 1777 to 1783, recorded the end of the war in his diary. On 19 April \\"The cessation of hostilities was announced in camp just eight years from the commencement thereof.\\" And finally \\"Our brigade received our furloughs, and we all decamped\\" on 6 June 1783. The war was finally, and successfully, over.

Andersen) (September 14, 1917 – September 24, 1986)Uell S. Andersen Library Thing was an American football player and self-help and short story author during the 1950s and 1960s. He is best known for his book, Three Magic Words. Biography Born to Norwegian-American parents in Portland, Oregon, Andersen attended Stanford University. He played college football for Stanford and was captain of the 1939 Stanford Indians football team. He was also one of the nation's top competitors in the shot put while attending Stanford. He played professional football in the National Football League (NFL) as a tackle and end for the Cleveland Rams (1940–1941) and Detroit Lions (1941). He appeared in 22 NFL games, 11 as a starter, and caught seven passes for 79 yards. He had a number of careers, including running an advertising agency, wild-catting for oil, and logging at the Columbia Sawmill. By the early 1950s, Andersen had moved to Los Angeles, California, where he became a successful businessman. As a young man, Andersen began studying the concepts of Christian Science, described in Mary Baker Eddy's book, \\"Science and Health.\\" He later began to study New Thought, in particular, the \\"Science of Mind\\" by Ernest Holmes. Holmes was a contemporary of Andersen, also living in Los Angeles at the same time. It has not yet been determined whether Andersen and Holmes knew each other. In 1952, Andersen began teaching a class on New Thought.In the first half of the 20th Century, Los Angeles, California became a center of New Thought teaching. In addition to Andersen, Ernest Holmes, Claude Bristol, Neville Goddard and Louise Hay all gave lectures on New Thought in Los Angeles. New Thought pioneer, Ralph Waldo Trine, also resided in Los Angeles county later in his life, and is buried there. All of these people have written significant books on the subject. The lessons from that class became his book, Three Magic Words,U.S. Andersen, Three Magic Words (1954) (2d ed. book jacket) which has subsequently become a classic in the New Thought literature. The book has been linked to the New Age philosophical concept known as the Law of Attraction. Anderson also wrote about non-spiritual subjects, with some success. He died in September 1986 in Lincoln City, Oregon. Philosophy =A Sustained Belief Will Manifest in the Physical World= Andersen taught the New Thought concept of \\"Universal Mind.\\" According to Andersen, the \\"Universal Mind is a vast and all-encompassing mental and spiritual being in whom all things and events exist.\\"U.S. Andersen, The Secret of Secrets, 1958. According to Andersen, the Universal Mind, or God, manifests -- or literally reflects -- the dominant belief system of all living things. When one understands this cause and effect relationship, it becomes possible to consciously use Universal Mind to shape the physical world. In Three Magic Words, Andersen makes the argument that the physical world is derived from the mental. He argues that a sustained mental image, if backed by faith (i.e. a belief that the image is real, or will become real), will become reality.U.S. Andersen, Three Magic Words (1954), at 91. This can be done by using a \\"spiritual prototype,\\" or mental equivalent of that which one wants to manifest in the physical world. The concept of a \\"spiritual prototype\\" originated in the New Thought literature in the early 20th century. Specifically, Andersen said the following: In other words, his philosophy is similar to that in the New Testament, which teaches, \\"As ye believe, so shall it be done unto you.\\".Bible, Matthew, 9:29 (\\"According to your faith let it be done to you\\") More recently, this idea is reflected in the book, The Secret, by Rhonda Byrne.Rhonda Byrne, The Secret (2006), at 91. Andersen argued that it was possible to prove his theory by conducting a few mental experiments, aided by means of meditation. After running these experiments, with complete faith in the outcome, it is possible to demonstrate—at least on a subjective basis—that there is a relationship between thought and physical reality. =Evil is the Result of False Thinking= The remainder of Andersen's theory followed from that simple premise. Since physical matter is created first on the mental plane, Andersen argued that good and evil events were also created by thought. This leads to a startling conclusion. If evil is created first on a mental plane by thought, then it becomes possible to abolish evil by refusing to believe in its existence. Andersen argued that evil was error, and that mankind should simply refuse to accept its existence. Specifically, he wrote the following: Andersen was not the first to argue that evil does not exist, and is a creation of man's false beliefs about the world. That notion had been expressed by earlier New Thought writers, in particular, Ernest Holmes, whom Andersen cites in his writing.See, Ernest Holmes, The Science of Mind (1938), at 39; U.S. Andersen, Three Magic Words, at 66. As explained by Holmes, \\"The time must come when evil . . . shall be rolled up like a scroll and numbered with the things which were once thought to be.\\"Holmes, The Science of Mind, at 39 Prior to Holmes, the Christian Science community argued that illness was a false belief, which manifested in the patient's body. Change the belief, and the patient gets a different result, i.e. health. Holmes and Andersen expanded on this idea by generalizing it to all evil, which they argued also did not exist, and was a product of false beliefs. =Theory of Evolution= In Three Magic Words, Andersen proposes a fascinating theory of evolution. He argues that all living creatures share the same universal mind -- and accompanying power to create -- with human beings. This leads to the observed effects of evolution, as living creatures aspire for greater physical abilities to ensure their survivability. Andersen writes: =The Lock= Andersen argued that this power, often described as the \\"law of attraction,\\" can be directed at will by controlling the sustained, believed images in our mind.U.S. Andersen, Three Magic Words (1954), at 45. Establishing sentinel over our thoughts is not as easy as it sounds. Andersen recognized that humans are constrained by existing beliefs about themselves and the world, fixed in their subconscious by past experience. He called this the \\"lock,\\" because it made it difficult for a person to believe in the desired outcome. Andersen argued that it was possible to break the lock of negative past experiences by means of meditation, and steadfastly creating mental images of the desired outcome.U.S. Andersen, Three Magic Words (1954), at 34. He recommended daily meditation, in support of his thought experiments. \\"Only hundreds of pages of discourse and proof will weaken its prejudice.\\"Ibid. Influence Through the work of Andersen and Holmes, the Law of Attraction acquired a degree of currency with the Hollywood set in the 1950s and 1960s.

Self-help writer Wayne Dyer cited Anderson as an influence, and would periodically quote from Three Magic Words in his speaking. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44ImQV46lF4 Adaptations The 2010 documentary film 3 Magic Words was inspired by Andersen's book Three Magic Words. The film was written, directed, and produced by Michael Perlin and co- produced by Maura Hoffman. The film was produced over four years.Whole Person Oct 2012 The lead is played by Gabriella Ethereal and the film is narrated by Cameron Smith. The film uses interviews, computer-animated graphics, and narration to address the question \\"Who Am I?\\". It does this while following a fictional account of a self-destructive young woman who has recently come out of a coma and doesn't know who she is. People interviewed in the film include Neale Donald Walsch, Gary Renard, Debbie Ford, Jasmuheen, and others. The film covers spiritual concepts from eastern mysticism and the New Age movement.

Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, it depicts the misadventures of a man-crazy, cigar-smoking, beer-guzzling, 1,500-year-old witch and her motley crew of friends. The original idea for Broom-Hilda came from Elliot Caplin, brother of Li'l Abner cartoonist Al Capp. He described the main character to Myers, who responded with a sketch of the witch and several samples. Caplin, acting as Myers' business manager, submitted these to the Chicago Tribune Syndicate. Introduced on April 19, 1970, it became an immediate success. Broom-Hilda was reprinted in several collections during the 1970s and 1980s. Characters and story Although events mostly take place during the present in an unidentified forest, the setting changes. Locales change drastically from day to day—and background details can change from panel to panel within the same strip, while the characters remain stationary (much like the backgrounds in Krazy Kat ). Broom-Hilda is capable of time travel, reappearing in various centuries throughout history to chat with (burlesque versions of) diverse historical figures. * Broom-Hilda (a pun on Brünnhilde) is a witch with green skin, a wart on the end of her nose and long stringy hair. She wears a black dress, black shoes, striped stockings (one perpetually drooping) and a black hat with a daisy on top. According to the strip's official site, Broom-Hilda is Attila the Hun's ex-wife. She is perpetually looking for a new husband but, due to her abrasive nature, the quest has thus far been unsuccessful. Early in the strip's run, she gave up cigar smoking and beer. She served in the United States Marine Corps for two days and was discharged for unnecessary roughness (glimpses of her underpants reveal a USMC label). A hint to her rough-hewn side occurs in one strip where she is buying underwear. The clerk suggests a set of underwear, each one bearing the days of the week. She asks if she can get a set with the months of the year. * Irwin Troll has much hair, but little intelligence. Perpetually innocent and naïve to the point of imbecility, he is a simple-minded, sweet-natured, nature-loving character—very unlike Broom-Hilda. * Gaylord Buzzard is a neurotic intellectual who wears thick, horn-rimmed glasses, spats and (sometimes) a fez for reading. Worldly, egotistical and sarcastic, he enjoys playing practical jokes on the other characters, particularly Broom-Hilda. He bears the scar of a youth spent in movie theaters: he's hopelessly addicted to popcorn. * Nerwin is Irwin's smart-aleck nephew, attaining the name from a newspaper contest as a blend of \\"nerd\\" and \\"Irwin\\". Irwin broke the fourth wall to address readers. Nerwin is often drawn wearing a propeller beanie, giving him the look of a stereotypical comic strip representation of a bratty juvenile delinquent, and he has also been known to frequently behave as such. * Grelber is never seen except for his eyes and perpetually grinning teeth, always peering out from a hollow log perched on the edge of a cliff. Mysterious and openly malevolent, he dispenses \\"Free insults\\", as a sign at the entrance of his log proclaims. * Wolfie is Broom-Hilda's small, timid pet wolf. Though an animal who never speaks, he is capable of intelligent thought, à la Snoopy. * Big Lump, a large dinosaur-like creature, appeared in the strip's early years. Animation Broom-Hilda was adapted twice for animated television series. The first was part of Archie's TV Funnies (1971), an animated series set in a television station run by Archie Andrews and his friends. Broom-Hilda was one of the comic strips featured on their show, along with Dick Tracy, Moon Mullins, Emmy Lou, The Captain and the Kids, The Dropouts, Nancy and Smokey Stover. The series was produced by Filmation Associates. Broom-Hilda's voice was provided by Jane Webb (also the voice of Betty Cooper and Veronica Lodge). Broom-Hilda returned in another Filmation series, Fabulous Funnies (1978). Thirteen episodes were produced, and the series ran for one season on NBC. The show featured animated versions of several famous comic strips, including Tumbleweeds, Alley Oop and Nancy. Voices were provided by June Foray (Broom- Hilda), Bob Holt (Gaylord) and Alan Oppenheimer (Irwin and Grelber). The character also made a brief animated appearance in The Fantastic Funnies (1980), a TV special that aired on CBS showcasing newspaper cartoonists. The animation sequence was produced by Bill Melendez Productions. June Foray was brought back to voice the character. Other media In 2004, it was announced that there would be a Broadway musicalWitching hour – Entertainment News, Legit News, Media – Variety based on the comic strip characters, written by Martin Charnin (Annie) and Kurt Andersen (Spy magazine). The music was composed by Leroy Anderson. There was discussion of casting with Andersen suggesting Catherine Zeta-JonesMy Way for the title role, but the show was not produced. Grelber also appeared as a computer program on old Unix systems. Typing the command \\"Grelber\\" would cause the computer to insult the user. Awards Myers won the National Cartoonists Society's Humor Comic Strip Award for 1975 for his work on the strip. Caplin died in 2000. Myers continues to write and draw the strip, compiling a large backlog of strips in the event poor health were to prevent him from meeting his syndication requirements.news from me – ARCHIVES Russell Myers collections *Broom-Hilda (1971) Lancer Books *I Love You, Broom-Hilda (1973) Tempo Books *Broom-Hilda Rides Again!

His Masters thesis was Co-operative Commonwealth Federation in Ontario, 1932-1945: a study of socialist and anti-socialist politics and was later revised and published in book form in 1973 as The Dilemma of Canadian Socialism : The CCF in Ontario. His doctoral thesis was also published as The Elites of Barotseland: A History of Zambia's Western Province. In 2000, he wrote a report on the subject, Rwanda: The Preventable Genocide for the Organization of African Unity's International Panel of Eminent Personalities to Investigate the 1994 Genocide in Rwanda. From 1967 to 1977, Caplan was an associate professor in the Department of History and Philosophy of Education at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education. Subsequently, he was director of CUSO's volunteer program in Nigeria. Political career Caplan has been a political activist all his life as a member of the CCF and its successor, the NDP. He was campaign manager in a series of election campaigns, both federal and provincial, including those for Ontario leader Donald C. MacDonald and national party leader David Lewis. A lifelong friend of David's son Stephen Lewis, he was also a close advisor and senior strategist to Lewis prior to and during his career as leader of the Ontario New Democratic Party in the 1970s. After a period serving as co-ordinator of Toronto's health advocacy unit from 1980 to 1982, Caplan returned to political work. From 1982 to 1984, Caplan was federal secretary of the New Democratic Party, and was national campaign manager for the 1984 general election. Political candidate In 1982, Caplan was a candidate for the federal NDP nomination in Broadview—Greenwood after Bob Rae vacated the seat to move to provincial politics. Caplan was upset in his bid for the nomination by Lynn McDonald, who defeated Caplan on the third ballot by a margin of 309 votes to 248. McDonald went on to keep the seat for the NDP in the ensuing by-election. Broadcasting In 1985, Caplan was co- chair of the Task Force on Canadian Broadcasting Policy by then-Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. For many years he remained vocal in defence of public broadcasting, some of it with the lobby group Friends of Canadian Broadcasting. Media He worked as a political columnist for the Toronto Star from the mid-1980s for a number of years, and was often on television and radio as a political pundit supporting the NDP. He was a member of the long- running Thursday morning Pundits' Panel on CTV Television's morning program, Canada AM. Following the 1988 federal election, he co-authored Election : the issues, the strategies, the aftermath with Liberal strategiest Michael Kirby and Tory strategist Hugh Segal. Caplan continues to contribute opinion pieces to various Canadian newspapers including the Star and The Globe and Mail, and has been a regular panelist on CBC News Network's Power & Politics. Royal Commission on Learning From 1993 to 1995, Caplan was co-chair of Ontario's Royal Commission on Learning having been appointed to the position by Ontario Premier Bob Rae. Prior to the 1999 Ontario election he served as the Director of Research for the Ontario NDP caucus. Africa In 1999, with his study of the Rwandan genocide, Caplan returned full-time to African matters. After completing the report on the genocide, he founded and became the co- coordinator of Remembering Rwanda, an international movement of volunteers dedicated to commemorating the tenth anniversary of the genocide. He has remained active around issues related to Rwanda and genocide prevention in general, frequently speaking and writing about both. In 2001, he was named by the United Nation's Special Coordinator for Africa as a member of the senior experts' team undertaking an evaluation of the UN's New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s. He has also acted as a consultant for the Economic Commission for Africa, UNICEF, WHO and the African Union. He served, as well, as volunteer chair of the International Advisory Board for the University of Toronto Centre for International Health's HIV/AIDS Initiative, and is part of the small team that supports Stephen Lewis in his work as UN Special Envoy for HIV/AIDS in Africa. Caplan has denounced the Roman Catholic Church on what he says is the notorious role of the institution in setting the stage for, enabling and ultimately participating in the genocide in Rwanda.The sins of the Christian Church The Globe and Mail Articles 'President Obama needs a refresher course on Africa' (2009) Published in Pambazuka News 'Abdelrazik's next challenge' (2009) Published in Pambazuka News 'Another opening, another show' (2009) Published in The Globe and Mail Obama in Africa: A Major Disappointment (2009) Published in The Nation 'It is, in fact, possible to criticize Israel without being anti-Semitic' (2014) Published in The Globe and Mail Publications * Editorials from Pambazuka News, Oxford: Pambazuka Press * Caplan, G (2008) The Betrayal of Africa, Groundwood Books * Caplan, G (2005) Why We Must Never Forget the Rwandan Genocide in Manji, F and Burnett, P (eds) African Voices on Development and Social Justice * Caplan, G (2005) Some Reminders of the International Response to the Crisis in Manji, F and Burnett, P (eds) African Voices on Development and Social Justice * Caplan, G (1970) The elites of Barotseland, 1878-1969: a political history of Zambia's Western Province, London: Hurst References External links *Why we must never forget the Rwandan Genocide Speech first published in Pambazuka News Category:1938 births Category:Living people Category:Canadian educational theorists Category:Canadian political journalists Category:Canadian political consultants Category:Canadian socialists Category:Canadian activists Category:Canadian officials of the United Nations Category:Jewish Canadian activists Category:Jewish Canadian writers Category:University of Toronto alumni Category:Alumni of SOAS University of London ","title":"Gerald Caplan"},{"id":"3608263","title":"Tucanoan languages"},{"id":"3608266","text":"Organic structure may refer to: * Organic (model), forms, methods and patterns found in living systems, often used as a metaphor for non-living things * The molecular structure of an organic compound, also known as the structural formula of an organic compound See also *Organic (disambiguation) ","title":"Organic structure"},{"id":"3608269","text":"\\"L.A. 2017\\" is a 1971 episode of the NBC television series The Name of the Game.

GAMs were originally developed by Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani to blend properties of generalized linear models with additive models. The model relates a univariate response variable, Y, to some predictor variables, xi. An exponential family distribution is specified for Y (for example normal, binomial or Poisson distributions) along with a link function g (for example the identity or log functions) relating the expected value of Y to the predictor variables via a structure such as : g(\\\\operatorname{E}(Y))=\\\\beta_0 + f_1(x_1) + f_2(x_2)+ \\\\cdots + f_m(x_m).\\\\,\\\\\\\\! The functions fi may be functions with a specified parametric form (for example a polynomial, or an un-penalized regression spline of a variable) or may be specified non-parametrically, or semi-parametrically, simply as 'smooth functions', to be estimated by non-parametric means. So a typical GAM might use a scatterplot smoothing function, such as a locally weighted mean, for f1(x1), and then use a factor model for f2(x2). This flexibility to allow non- parametric fits with relaxed assumptions on the actual relationship between response and predictor, provides the potential for better fits to data than purely parametric models, but arguably with some loss of interpretability. Theoretical background It had been known since the 1950s (via. the Kolmogorov–Arnold representation theorem) that any multivariate function could be represented as sums and compositions of univariate functions. : f(\\\\vec x) = \\\\sum_{q=0}^{2n} \\\\Phi_{q}\\\\left(\\\\sum_{p=1}^{n} \\\\phi_{q,p}(x_{p})\\\\right) Unfortunately, though the Kolmogorov–Arnold representation theorem asserts the existence of a function of this form, it gives no mechanism whereby one could be constructed. Certain constructive proofs exist, but they tend to require highly complicated (i.e. fractal) functions, and thus are not suitable for modeling approaches. Therefore, the generalized additive model drops the outer sum, and demands instead that the function belong to a simpler class. : f(\\\\vec x) = \\\\Phi\\\\left(\\\\sum_{p=1}^{n} \\\\phi_{p}(x_{p})\\\\right) where \\\\Phi is a smooth monotonic function. Writing g for the inverse of \\\\Phi, this is traditionally written as : g(f(\\\\vec x))=\\\\sum_{i} f_{i}(x_{i}). When this function is approximating the expectation of some observed quantity, it could be written as : g(\\\\operatorname{E}(Y))=\\\\beta_0 + f_1(x_1) + f_2(x_2)+ \\\\cdots + f_m(x_m).\\\\,\\\\\\\\! Which is the standard formulation of a generalized additive model. It was then shown that the backfitting algorithm will always converge for these functions. Generality The GAM model class is quite broad, given that smooth function is a rather broad category. For example, a covariate x_j may be multivariate and the corresponding f_j a smooth function of several variables, or f_j might be the function mapping the level of a factor to the value of a random effect. Another example is a varying coefficient (geographic regression) term such as z_jf_j(x_j) where z_j and x_j are both covariates. Or if x_j(t) is itself an observation of a function, we might include a term such as \\\\int f_j(t)x_j(t)dt (sometimes known as a signal regression term). f_j could also be a simple parametric function as might be used in any generalized linear model. The model class has been generalized in several directions, notably beyond exponential family response distributions, beyond modelling of only the mean and beyond univariate data. GAM fitting methods The original GAM fitting method estimated the smooth components of the model using non-parametric smoothers (for example smoothing splines or local linear regression smoothers) via the backfitting algorithm. Backfitting works by iterative smoothing of partial residuals and provides a very general modular estimation method capable of using a wide variety of smoothing methods to estimate the f_j(x_j) terms. A disadvantage of backfitting is that it is difficult to integrate with the estimation of the degree of smoothness of the model terms, so that in practice the user must set these, or select between a modest set of pre-defined smoothing levels. If the f_j(x_j) are represented using smoothing splines then the degree of smoothness can be estimated as part of model fitting using generalized cross validation, or by restricted maximum likelihood (REML, sometimes known as 'GML') which exploits the duality between spline smoothers and Gaussian random effects. This full spline approach carries an O(n^3) computational cost, where n is the number of observations for the response variable, rendering it somewhat impractical for moderately large datasets. More recent methods have addressed this computational cost either by up front reduction of the size of the basis used for smoothing (rank reduction) or by finding sparse representations of the smooths using Markov random fields, which are amenable to the use of sparse matrix methods for computation. These more computationally efficient methods use GCV (or AIC or similar) or REML or take a fully Bayesian approach for inference about the degree of smoothness of the model components. Estimating the degree of smoothness via REML can be viewed as an empirical Bayes method. An alternative approach with particular advantages in high dimensional settings is to use boosting, although this typically requires bootstrapping for uncertainty quantification. GAMs fit using bagging and boosting have been found to generally outperform GAMs fit using spline methods. The rank reduced framework Many modern implementations of GAMs and their extensions are built around the reduced rank smoothing approach, because it allows well founded estimation of the smoothness of the component smooths at comparatively modest computational cost, and also facilitates implementation of a number of model extensions in a way that is more difficult with other methods. At its simplest the idea is to replace the unknown smooth functions in the model with basis expansions : f_j(x_j) = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{K_j} \\\\beta_{jk} b_{jk}(x_j) where the b_{jk}(x_j) are known basis functions, usually chosen for good approximation theoretic properties (for example B splines or reduced rank thin plate splines), and the \\\\beta_{jk} are coefficients to be estimated as part of model fitting. The basis dimension K_j is chosen to be sufficiently large that we expect it to overfit the data to hand (thereby avoiding bias from model over- simplification), but small enough to retain computational efficiency. If p = \\\\sum_j K_j then the computational cost of model estimation this way will be O(np^2). Notice that the f_j are only identifiable to within an intercept term (we could add any constant to f_1 while subtracting it from f_2 without changing the model predictions at all), so identifiability constraints have to be imposed on the smooth terms to remove this ambiguity. Sharpest inference about the f_j is generally obtained by using the sum-to-zero constraints :\\\\sum_i f_j(x_{ji}) = 0 i.e. by insisting that the sum of each the f_j evaluated at its observed covariate values should be zero. Such linear constraints can most easily be imposed by reparametrization at the basis setup stage, so below it is assumed that this has been done. Having replaced all the f_j in the model with such basis expansions we have turned the GAM into a Generalized linear model (GLM), with a model matrix that simply contains the basis functions evaluated at the observed x_j values. However, because the basis dimensions, K_j, have been chosen to be a somewhat larger than is believed to be necessary for the data, the model is over-parameterized and will overfit the data if estimated as a regular GLM. The solution to this problem is to penalize departure from smoothness in the model fitting process, controlling the weight given to the smoothing penalties using smoothing parameters. For example, consider the situation in which all the smooths are univariate functions. Writing all the parameters in one vector, \\\\beta , suppose that D(\\\\beta) is the deviance (twice the difference between saturated log likelihood and the model log likelihood) for the model. Minimizing the deviance by the usual iteratively re-weighted least squares would result in overfit, so we seek \\\\beta to minimize : D(\\\\beta) + \\\\sum_j \\\\lambda_j \\\\int f^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}_j(x)^2 dx where the integrated square second derivative penalties serve to penalize wiggliness (lack of smoothness) of the f_j during fitting, and the smoothing parameters \\\\lambda_j control the tradeoff between model goodness of fit and model smoothness. In the example \\\\lambda_j \\\\to \\\\infty would ensure that the estimate of f_j(x_j) would be a straight line in x_j. Given the basis expansion for each f_j the wiggliness penalties can be expressed as quadratic forms in the model coefficients. That is we can write :\\\\int f^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}_j(x)^2 dx = \\\\beta^T_j \\\\bar S_j \\\\beta_j = \\\\beta^T S_j \\\\beta, where \\\\bar S_j is a matrix of known coefficients computable from the penalty and basis, \\\\beta_j is the vector of coefficients for f_j, and S_j is just \\\\bar S_j padded with zeros so that the second equality holds and we can write the penalty in terms of the full coefficient vector \\\\beta. Many other smoothing penalties can be written in the same way, and given the smoothing parameters the model fitting problem now becomes : \\\\hat \\\\beta = \\\\text{argmin}_\\\\beta \\\\\\\\{ D(\\\\beta) + \\\\sum_j \\\\lambda_j \\\\beta^T S_j \\\\beta \\\\\\\\}, which can be found using a penalized version of the usual iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) algorithm for GLMs: the algorithm is unchanged except that the sum of quadratic penalties is added to the working least squared objective at each iteration of the algorithm. Penalization has several effects on inference, relative to a regular GLM. For one thing the estimates are subject to some smoothing bias, which is the price that must be paid for limiting estimator variance by penalization. However, if smoothing parameters are selected appropriately the (squared) smoothing bias introduced by penalization should be less than the reduction in variance that it produces, so that the net effect is a reduction in mean square estimation error, relative to not penalizing. A related effect of penalization is that the notion of degrees of freedom of a model has to be modified to account for the penalties' action in reducing the coefficients' freedom to vary. For example, if W is the diagonal matrix of IRLS weights at convergence, and X is the GAM model matrix, then the model effective degrees of freedom is given by \\\\text{trace}(F) where :F = (X^T WX + \\\\sum_j \\\\lambda_j S_j)^{-1}X^T WX , is the effective degrees of freedom matrix. In fact summing just the diagonal elements of F corresponding to the coefficients of f_j gives the effective degrees of freedom for the estimate of f_j. = Bayesian smoothing priors = Smoothing bias complicates interval estimation for these models, and the simplest approach turns out to involve a Bayesian approach. Understanding this Bayesian view of smoothing also helps to understand the REML and full Bayes approaches to smoothing parameter estimation. At some level smoothing penalties are imposed because we believe smooth functions to be more probable than wiggly ones, and if that is true then we might as well formalize this notion by placing a prior on model wiggliness. A very simple prior might be : \\\\pi(\\\\beta) \\\\propto \\\\exp\\\\\\\\{- \\\\beta^T\\\\sum_j \\\\lambda_j S_j \\\\beta/(2 \\\\phi)\\\\\\\\} (where \\\\phi is the GLM scale parameter introduced only for later convenience), but we can immediately recognize this as a multivariate normal prior with mean 0 and precision matrix S_\\\\lambda = \\\\sum_j \\\\lambda_j S_j/\\\\phi. Since the penalty allows some functions through unpenalized (straight lines, given the example penalties), S_\\\\lambda is rank deficient, and the prior is actually improper, with a covariance matrix given by the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of S_\\\\lambda (the impropriety corresponds to ascribing infinite variance to the unpenalized components of a smooth). Now if this prior is combined with the GLM likelihood, we find that the posterior mode for \\\\beta is exactly the \\\\hat \\\\beta found above by penalized IRLS. Furthermore, we have the large sample result that :\\\\betay \\\\sim N (\\\\hat \\\\beta, (X^T WX + S_\\\\lambda)^{-1}\\\\phi). which can be used to produce confidence/credible intervals for the smooth components, f_j. The Gaussian smoothness priors are also the basis for fully Bayesian inference with GAMs, as well as methods estimating GAMs as mixed models that are essentially empirical Bayes methods. = Smoothing parameter estimation = So far we have treated estimation and inference given the smoothing parameters, \\\\lambda , but these also need to be estimated. One approach is to take a fully Bayesian approach, defining priors on the (log) smoothing parameters, and using stochastic simulation or high order approximation methods to obtain information about the posterior of the model coefficients. An alternative is to select the smoothing parameters to optimize a prediction error criterion such as Generalized cross validation (GCV) or the Akaike information criterion (AIC). Finally we may choose to maximize the Marginal Likelihood (REML) obtained by integrating the model coefficients, \\\\beta out of the joint density of \\\\beta,y, : \\\\hat \\\\lambda = \\\\text{argmax}_\\\\lambda \\\\int f(y\\\\beta,\\\\lambda)\\\\pi(\\\\beta\\\\lambda) d \\\\beta . Since f(y\\\\beta,\\\\lambda) is just the likelihood of \\\\beta, we can view this as choosing \\\\lambda to maximize the average likelihood of random draws from the prior. The preceding integral is usually analytically intractable but can be approximated to quite high accuracy using Laplace's method. Smoothing parameter inference is the most computationally taxing part of model estimation/inference. For example, to optimize a GCV or marginal likelihood typically requires numerical optimization via a Newton or Quasi-Newton method, with each trial value for the (log) smoothing parameter vector requiring a penalized IRLS iteration to evaluate the corresponding \\\\hat \\\\beta alongside the other ingredients of the GCV score or Laplace approximate marginal likelihood (LAML). Furthermore, to obtain the derivatives of the GCV or LAML, required for optimization, involves implicit differentiation to obtain the derivatives of \\\\hat \\\\beta w.r.t. the log smoothing parameters, and this requires some care is efficiency and numerical stability are to be maintained. Software Backfit GAMs were originally provided by the \`gam\` function in S, now ported to the R language as the \`gam\` package. The SAS proc \`GAM\` also provides backfit GAMs. The recommended package in R for GAMs is \`mgcv\`, which stands for mixed GAM computational vehicle, which is based on the reduced rank approach with automatic smoothing parameter selection. The SAS proc \`GAMPL\` is an alternative implementation. In Python, there is the \`InterpretML\` package, which implements a bagging and boosting approach. There are many alternative packages. Examples include the R packages \`mboost\`, which implements a boosting approach; \`gss\`, which provides the full spline smoothing methods; \`VGAM\` which provides vector GAMs; and \`gamlss\`, which provides Generalized additive model for location, scale and shape. \`BayesX' and its R interface provides GAMs and extensions via MCMC and penalized likelihood methods. The \`INLA' software implements a fully Bayesian approach based on Markov random field representations exploiting sparse matrix methods. As an example of how models can be estimated in practice with software, consider R package \`mgcv\`. Suppose that our R workspace contains vectors y, x and z and we want to estimate the model : y_i = \\\\beta_0 + f_1(x_i) + f_2(z_i) + \\\\epsilon_i \\\\text{ where } \\\\epsilon_i \\\\sim N(0,\\\\sigma^2). Within R we could issue the commands library(mgcv) # load the package b = gam(y ~ s(x) + s(z)) In common with most R modelling functions \`gam\` expects a model formula to be supplied, specifying the model structure to fit. The response variable is given to the left of the \`~\` while the specification of the linear predictor is given to the right. \`gam\` sets up bases and penalties for the smooth terms, estimates the model including its smoothing parameters and, in standard R fashion, returns a fitted model object, which can then be interrogated using various helper functions, such as \`summary\`, \`plot\`, \`predict\`, and \`AIC\`. This simple example has used several default settings which it is important to be aware of. For example a Gaussian distribution and identity link has been assumed, and the smoothing parameter selection criterion was GCV. Also the smooth terms were represented using \`penalized thin plate regression splines', and the basis dimension for each was set to 10 (implying a maximum of 9 degrees of freedom after identifiability constraints have been imposed). A second example illustrates how we can control these things. Suppose that we want to estimate the model : y_i \\\\sim \\\\text{Poi}(\\\\mu_i) \\\\text{ where } \\\\log \\\\mu_i = \\\\beta_0 + \\\\beta_1 x_i + f_1(t_i) + f_2(v_i,w_i). using REML smoothing parameter selection, and we expect f_1 to be a relatively complicated function which we would like to model with a penalized cubic regression spline. For f_2 we also have to decide whether v and w are naturally on the same scale so that an isotropic smoother such as thin plate spline is appropriate (specified via \`s(v,w)'), or whether they are really on different scales so that we need separate smoothing penalties and smoothing parameters for v and w as provided by a tensor product smoother. Suppose we opted for the latter in this case, then the following R code would estimate the model b1 = gam(y ~ x + s(t,bs=\\"cr\\",k=100) + te(v,w),family=poisson,method=\\"REML\\") which uses a basis size of 100 for the smooth of t. The specification of distribution and link function uses the \`family' objects that are standard when fitting GLMs in R or S. Note that Gaussian random effects can also be added to the linear predictor. These examples are only intended to give a very basic flavour of the way that GAM software is used, for more detail refer to the software documentation for the various packages and the references below. Model checking As with any statistical model it is important to check the model assumptions of a GAM. Residual plots should be examined in the same way as for any GLM. That is deviance residuals (or other standardized residuals) should be examined for patterns that might suggest a substantial violation of the independence or mean-variance assumptions of the model. This will usually involve plotting the standardized residuals against fitted values and covariates to look for mean-variance problems or missing pattern, and may also involve examining Correlograms (ACFs) and/or Variograms of the residuals to check for violation of independence. If the model mean-variance relationship is correct then scaled residuals should have roughly constant variance. Note that since GLMs and GAMs can be estimated using Quasi-likelihood, it follows that details of the distribution of the residuals beyond the mean-variance relationship are of relatively minor importance. One issue that is more common with GAMs than with other GLMs is a danger of falsely concluding that data are zero inflated. The difficulty arises when data contain many zeroes that can be modelled by a Poisson or binomial with a very low expected value: the flexibility of the GAM structure will often allow representation of a very low mean over some region of covariate space, but the distribution of standardized residuals will fail to look anything like the approximate normality that introductory GLM classes teach us to expect, even if the model is perfectly correct. The one extra check that GAMs introduce is the need to check that the degrees of freedom chosen are appropriate. This is particularly acute when using methods that do not automatically estimate the smoothness of model components. When using methods with automatic smoothing parameter selection then it is still necessary to check that the choice of basis dimension was not restrictively small, although if the effective degrees of freedom of a term estimate is comfortably below its basis dimension then this is unlikely. In any case, checking f_j(x_j) is based on examining pattern in the residuals with respect to x_j. This can be done using partial residuals overlaid on the plot of \\\\hat f_j(x_j), or using permutation of the residuals to construct tests for residual pattern (as in the \`gam.check' function in R package \`mgcv'). Model selection When smoothing parameters are estimated as part of model fitting then much of what would traditionally count as model selection has been absorbed into the fitting process: the smoothing parameters estimation has already selected between a rich family of models of different functional complexity. However smoothing parameter estimation does not typically remove a smooth term from the model altogether, because of the fact that most penalties leave some functions un-penalized (e.g. straight lines are unpenalized by the spline derivative penalty given above). So the question of whether a term should be in the model at all remains. One simple approach to this issue is to add an extra penalty to each smooth term in the GAM, which penalizes the components of the smooth that would otherwise be unpenalized (and only those). Each extra penalty has its own smoothing parameter and estimation then proceeds as before, but now with the possibility that terms will be completely penalized to zero. In high dimensional settings then it may make more sense to attempt this task using the Lasso (statistics) or Elastic net regularization. Boosting also performs term selection automatically as part of fitting. An alternative is to use traditional Stepwise regression methods for model selection. This is also the default method when smoothing parameters are not estimated as part of fitting, in which case each smooth term is usually allowed to take one of a small set of pre-defined smoothness levels within the model, and these are selected between in a stepwise fashion. Stepwise methods operate by iteratively comparing models with or without particular model terms (or possibly with different levels of term complexity), and require measures of model fit or term significance in order to decide which model to select at each stage. For example, we might use p-values for testing each term for equality to zero to decide on candidate terms for removal from a model, and we might compare Akaike information criterion (AIC) values for alternative models. P-value computation for smooths is not straightforward, because of the effects of penalization, but approximations are available. AIC can be computed in two ways for GAMs. The marginal AIC is based on the Mariginal Likelihood (see above) with the model coefficients integrated out. In this case the AIC penalty is based on the number of smoothing parameters (and any variance parameters) in the model. However, because of the well known fact that REML is not comparable between models with different fixed effects structures, we can not usually use such an AIC to compare models with different smooth terms (since their un-penalized components act like fixed effects). Basing AIC on the marginal likelihood in which only the penalized effects are integrated out is possible (the number of un-penalized coefficients now gets added to the parameter count for the AIC penalty), but this version of the marginal likelihood suffers from the tendency to oversmooth that provided the original motivation for developing REML. Given these problems GAMs are often compared using the conditional AIC, in which the model likelihood (not marginal likelihood) is used in the AIC, and the parameter count is taken as the effective degrees of freedom of the model. Naive versions of the conditional AIC have been shown to be much too likely to select larger models in some circumstances, a difficulty attributable to neglect of smoothing parameter uncertainty when computing the effective degrees of freedom, however correcting the effective degrees of freedom for this problem restores reasonable performance. Caveats Overfitting can be a problem with GAMs, especially if there is un-modelled residual auto-correlation or un-modelled overdispersion. Cross-validation can be used to detect and/or reduce overfitting problems with GAMs (or other statistical methods), and software often allows the level of penalization to be increased to force smoother fits. Estimating very large numbers of smoothing parameters is also likely to be statistically challenging, and there are known tendencies for prediction error criteria (GCV, AIC etc.) to occasionally undersmooth substantially, particularly at moderate sample sizes, with REML being somewhat less problematic in this regard. Where appropriate, simpler models such as GLMs may be preferable to GAMs unless GAMs improve predictive ability substantially (in validation sets) for the application in question.

The strip was a soap opera, following the prototype set by Mary Worth but elevated by Drake's exceptional artwork. The strip's first storylines were based on a treatment by writer Margaret Mitchell. The figure drawing was characterized by Drake's pioneering use of naturalistic movement and expression, a style he achieved partly through the use of Polaroid photographic reference.Mary Worth at Don Markstein's Toonopedia.

Brunette Juliet Jones, the older, was modest, sensible and successful. Buxom blonde Eve Jones was flirty, flighty, and in and out of trouble. Their elderly father Howard, a decent but dull man easily swayed by both of his daughters, also played a leading role.

Her parents decided to give up her and her brother for adoption as teenagers by their maternal aunt and uncle, Virginia and Ernest Whitworth Marland, who were both childless and fabulously wealthy from his success in the oil business in Ponca City, Oklahoma. Two years after Virginia Marland died in 1926, E. W. annulled the adoption of Lydie Roberts Marland. They married that year, when she was 28 and he was 54. Lydie Roberts Marland enjoyed volatile times and drastic changes in fortune with her husband: he lost much of his money in 1928; she accompanied him to Washington, DC after he was elected to the US Congress in 1932, and to the Oklahoma governor's mansion as his First Lady in 1934. After his gubernatorial term, they lived in the chauffeur's cottage of their former mansion and sold the big house and grounds. Following his death in 1941, Lydie Marland became more reclusive. In the 1950s, she disappeared from Oklahoma for more than a decade. She returned to Ponca City for her later years, and succeeded in having the Marlands' Palace on the Prairies purchased and preserved by the city. Early life and education Lydie (her preferred spelling) and her older brother George (born November 19, 1897) were the children of Margaret Reynolds (Collins) and George Frederick Roberts of Flourtown, Pennsylvania. Their grandparents were George W. Roberts and Mary B. (Fine) Roberts, and Samuel Cavin Collins, Sr. and Lydie \\"Eliza\\" (Miller) Collins. Their parents struggled financially. In 1912 the family visited their mother's sister, Mary Virginia (Collins) (called Virginia) and her husband, E. W. Marland, an oil millionaire in Ponca City, Oklahoma. The Roberts hoped to interest the childless Marlands in their children, to provide them with a better economic future. The pair of children stayed with their aunt and uncle and started school in Oklahoma. In 1916, the Marlands adopted Lydie and George, then 16 and 19. Lydie attended the local Catholic school, but her adoptive parents soon sent her back East to private boarding schools. She finished her education at the Oaksmere School in New Rochelle, located in Westchester County, New York on a property overlooking Long Island Sound.\\"GIRLS FIGHT SCHOOL FIRE.; Oaksmere Students Also Dig Engine Out of the Snow\\", New York Times, 19 February 1914, accessed 13 June 2012. Note: Previous text said the school was on Long Island, but can find no documentation of that and more than one reference to its being in New Rochelle.Apman, Patti, Lydie Roberts Marland: The Princess of the Palace on the Prairie, 1995, pp. 3-4 The school was founded by Winifred Edgerton Merrill, the first American woman to be awarded a Ph.D. in mathematics. Following graduation from Oaksmere, Lydie returned to Ponca City. Because of her family's wealth, her social activities, which included evening parties and formal fox hunts, were followed by the local and sometimes national press. Together with polo matches, her adoptive father E. W. Marland had initiated the fox hunts in Oklahoma, importing the red foxes, hunting dogs and hunters (horses) to support his new sports. He also started a local polo club and had polo ponies shipped in, along with trainers. At this time the Marlands were living in the Grand House on Grand Avenue, where they had developed eight acres of formal gardens with the mansion. (This estate is now preserved as the Marland-Paris Mansion and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.) They also had commissioned a larger Italianate mansion, the \\"Palace on the Prairie,\\" designed by the architect John Duncan Forsyth. It was under construction from 1925 to 1928. Lydie's adoptive mother Virginia Marland died on June 6, 1926, while construction was underway. Marriage and family Within two years, E.W. returned to Flourtown, Pennsylvania, and had his adoption of Lydie annulled (it was dated from a dozen years before). On July 14, 1928, E. W. and Lydie were married in Philadelphia. She was 28 and he was 54. After an extended honeymoon and train travel across Canada to California, the Marlands returned to Ponca City. Boom and bust At one time considered one of the richest men in the world, Marland lost much of his fortune for a second time. By 1928 the Marland Oil Company, now Conoco, had been taken over by \\"the Wolves of Wall Street\\", primarily by J. P. Morgan. Marland lost much money in the transaction and the stock market crash. By 1930, the Marlands had moved out of the Palace and set up in the artist studio and guest house, which was modified for them. Political life and \\"First Lady of Oklahoma\\" Two years later, in 1932, E. W. ran successfully for the U.S. Congress from Oklahoma's 8th congressional district, and the couple moved to Washington, D. C. In 1934 they returned to Oklahoma after Marland was elected as governor. Lydie served as his First Lady. Although his tenure [1935-1939] was politically successful, Marland lost more money while in office. To ensure that he would not benefit financially from his position, he put his investments in trust during his tenure. He took seriously his oath that he would not, \\"knowingly, receive, directly or indirectly, any money or other valuable thing, for the performance or nonperformance of any act or duty pertaining to my office, other than the compensation allowed by law.\\" He was financially broken by the end of his term. In 1941 the Marlands moved into the chauffeur's quarters and sold their Palace on the Prairie and most of the property to the Discalced Carmelite Fathers of Mexico. Marland died several months later, leaving Lydie a widow at age 41. She continued living in the chauffeur's cottage for another dozen years, becoming increasingly reclusive. The Carmelite Fathers asked for the removal of a statue of Lydie by Jo Davidson, which her husband had commissioned for the grounds. Lydie paid a Ponca City man to haul it away. Later years In 1953 Lydie Marland loaded her remaining possessions and drove away from Ponca City without a driver's license. Her whereabouts for the next 22 years remain mostly a mystery. Because she was a nationally known figure, newspapers reported when she was discovered working as a maid in Independence, Missouri. Later she was recognized in a bread line in New York City. In 1967, she surfaced marching in an anti-Vietnam War rally in Washington, D.C., and next was identified in San Francisco. In 1975, a Ponca City lawyer (and childhood friend) located Marland in Washington, D.C., and financed her return to Ponca City. She moved back into the chauffeur's cottage. Although a recluse, she led efforts to have Ponca City purchase the Palace on the Prairie when it came up for sale again, and turn it into a house museum. She and other supporters were successful in having the Palace bought and preserved as a historic property. She continued to live in the cottage until her death on July 25, 1987. Years later, the Ponca City man who had removed her statue talked about the event on his deathbed. He described where he had buried the statue in a crate. It was eventually discovered by Paul Prather, former curator emeritus of the mansion, as documented in a feature that appeared in the Sunday Oklahoman, dug up and restored by patrons. The statue of Lydie now stands next to a Davidson portrayal of her brother George Roberts Marland in the entrance hallway of what is now known as the E. W. Marland Mansion. This mansion has been designated a National Historic Landmark. Together the two Marland mansions and outbuildings have been adapted to house some small museums, devoted to art and to Native American crafts and culture, as well as exhibits on the Marland family and Oklahoma's oil business. Representation in other media In August 2012 the Weinstein Company announced that they are attached to produce the romantic drama, Ends of the Earth, directed by Academy Award-nominee David O. Russell written by Academy Award-winning screenwriter Chris Terrio, based on the lives of EW and Lydie Marland and starring Academy Award-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence as Lydie Marland.

The book is the fourth installment in Angelou's series of seven autobiographies. The Heart of a Woman recounts events in Angelou's life between 1957 and 1962 and follows her travels to California, New York City, Cairo, and Ghana as she raises her teenage son, becomes a published author, becomes active in the civil rights movement, and becomes romantically involved with a South African anti-apartheid fighter. One of the most important themes of The Heart of a Woman is motherhood, as Angelou continues to raise her son. The book ends with her son leaving for college and Angelou looking forward to newfound independence and freedom. Like Angelou's previous volumes, the book has been described as autobiographical fiction, though most critics, as well as Angelou, have characterized it as autobiography. Although most critics consider Angelou's first autobiography I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings more favorably, The Heart of a Woman has received positive reviews.

Background  The Heart of a Woman, published in 1981, is the fourth installment of Maya Angelou's series of seven autobiographies. The success of her previous autobiographies and the publication of three volumes of poetry had brought Angelou a considerable amount of fame by 1981. And Still I Rise, her third volume of poetry, was published in 1978 and reinforced Angelou's success as a writer. Her first volume of poetry, Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie (1971), was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize. Writer Julian Mayfield states that Angelou's work set a precedent not only for other black women writers but for the genre of autobiography as a whole.Als, Hilton.

Angelou was one of the first African- American female writers to discuss her personal life publicly, and one of the first to use herself as a central character in her books. Writer Hilton Als calls her a pioneer of self-exposure, willing to focus honestly on the more negative aspects of her personality and choices. While Angelou was composing her second autobiography, Gather Together in My Name, she was concerned about how her readers would react to her disclosure that she had been a prostitute.Lupton (1998), p. 14. Her husband Paul Du Feu talked her into publishing the book by encouraging her to \\"tell the truth as a writer\\" and to \\"be honest about it.\\" In 1957, the year The Heart of a Woman opens, Angelou had appeared in an off-Broadway revue that inspired her first film, Calypso Heat Wave, in which Angelou sang and performed her own compositions,Miller, John M. \\"Calypso Heat Wave\\", Turner Classic Movies.

Angelou takes the title of her fourth autobiography from a poem by Georgia Douglas Johnson, a Harlem Renaissance writer. Critic Lyman B. Hagan states that although the title is \\"less striking or oblique than titles of her preceding books,\\"Hagen, p. 96. it is appropriate because Johnson's poem mentions a caged bird and provides a connection to Angelou's first autobiography, whose title was taken from a poem by Paul Lawrence Dunbar. The title suggests Angelou's painful loneliness and exposes a spiritual dilemma also present in her first volume. Johnson's use of the metaphor is different from Dunbar's because her bird is a female whose isolation is sexual rather than racial. The caged bird may also refer to Angelou after her failed marriage,Saunders, James R (October 1991). \\"Breaking Out of the Cage: The Autobiographical Writings of Maya Angelou\\".

The Heart of a Woman is the first time Angelou identifies with another female African-American writer. Her early literary influences were men, including James Weldon Johnson, Paul Lawrence Dunbar, and William Shakespeare. Angelou has stated that she always admired women writers like Anne Spencer, Jessie Fauset, Nella Larsen, and Zora Neale Hurston. Her choice of title for this book is an acknowledgment of her legacy as a Black woman writer.Lupton (1998), p. 123.  Plot summary  Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s Southern Christian Leadership Conference in The Heart of a Woman. The events described in The Heart of a Woman take place between 1957 and 1962, beginning shortly after the end of Angelou's previous autobiography, Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas. Angelou and her teenage son Guy have moved into a houseboat commune in Sausalito, California.Angelou (1981), p. 4. After a year, they move to a rented house near San Francisco. Singer Billie Holiday visits Angelou and her son there, and Holiday sings \\"Strange Fruit\\", her famous song about the lynching of Black men, to Guy. Holiday tells Angelou, \\"You're going to be famous. But it won't be for singing.\\"Angelou (1981), p. 19. In 1959, Angelou and Guy moved to New York City. The transition is difficult for Guy, and Angelou is forced to protect him from a gang leader. No longer satisfied with performing in nightclubs, she dedicates herself to acting, writing, political organizing, and her son. Her friend, novelist John Killens, invites her to join the Harlem Writers Guild. She meets other important African-American artists and writers, including James Baldwin, who would become her mentor. She becomes a published writer for the first time. Angelou becomes more politically active and participates in African-American and African protest rallies, including helping to organize a sit-in at the United Nations following the execution of Patrice Lumumba, the ousted prime minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. She meets Malcolm X and is struck by his good looks and magnetism. After hearing Martin Luther King Jr. speak, she and her friend, activist Godfrey Cambridge, are inspired to produce a successful fundraising event for King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) called Cabaret For Freedom. King names her coordinator of SCLC's office in New York. She performs in Jean Genet's play The Blacks, with Roscoe Lee Brown, James Earl Jones, and Cicely Tyson. In 1961, Angelou meets South African freedom fighter Vusumzi Make. Angelou and Make never marry, but she and Guy move with Make to London and Cairo, where she acts as his political wife while he is in exile. Their relationship is full of cultural conflicts; he expects her to be a subservient African wife, and she yearns for the freedom of a working woman. She learns that Make is too friendly with other women and is irresponsible with money, so she accepts a position as assistant editor at the Arab Observer. Their relationship is examined by their community of friends, and Angelou and Make eventually separate. Angelou accepts a job in Liberia, and she and Guy travel to Accra, where he has been accepted to attend college. Guy is seriously injured in an automobile accident, so she begins working at the University of Ghana and remains there while he recuperates. The Heart of a Woman ends with Guy leaving for college and Angelou remarking to herself, \\"At last, I'll be able to eat the whole breast of a roast chicken by myself.\\"Angelou (1981), p. 336.  Genre  All seven of Angelou's installments of her life story are in the tradition of African-American autobiography. Starting with I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, Angelou challenges the usual structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing, and expanding the genre.Lupton (1998), p. 98. Angelou said in 1989 that she is the only serious writer to choose autobiography to express herself,Lupton (1998), p. 30. but she reports not one person's story, but the collective's.Gilbert, Susan (1999). \\"Paths to Escape\\". In Joanne M. Braxton. Maya Angelou's I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings: A Casebook. New York: Oxford University Press, pp. 104–105. . Scholar Selwyn R. Cudjoe writes that Angelou is representative of the convention in African-American autobiography as a public gesture that speaks for an entire group of people.Cudjoe, pp. 10–11. Her use of devices common in fictional writing, such as dialog, characterization and thematic development, has led some reviewers to categorize her books as autobiographical fiction.Lupton (1998), pp. 29–30. All of Angelou's autobiographies conform to the autobiography's standard structure: they are written by a single author, they are chronological, and they contain elements of character, technique, and theme.Lupton (1998), p. 32. In a 1983 interview with literature critic Claudia Tate, Angelou calls her books autobiographies,Tate, Claudia. (1999). \\"Maya Angelou: An Interview\\". In Joanne M. Braxton, Maya Angelou's I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings: A Casebook. New York: Oxford University Press, p. 153. . and later acknowledges that she follows the slave narrative tradition of \\"speaking in the first-person singular talking about the first-person plural, always saying 'I' meaning 'we'\\". Lupton compares The Heart of a Woman with other autobiographies, and states that for the first time in Angelou's series, she is able to present herself as a model for successful living. However, Angelou's \\"woman's heart\\"—her perspective as a woman with concerns about her self-esteem and the conflicts with her lovers and her son—is what makes her autobiography different. Angelou's feelings as described in The Heart of a Woman, which Lupton calls Angelou's \\"most introspective\\" book, are what dictates the book's form. Angelou recognizes that there are fictional aspects to all her books, which differentiate her work from more traditional \\"truthful\\" autobiographies.Lupton (1998), p. 34. Her approach parallels the conventions of many African-American autobiographies written during the abolitionist period in the US when truth was often censored for purposes of self- protection.Sartwell, Crispin (1998). Act Like You Know: African-American Autobiography and White Identity. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. p. 26. . Lyman B. Hagen places Angelou in the tradition of African-American autobiography, but insists that she has created a unique interpretation of the autobiographical form.Hagen, pp. 6–7. In a 1998 interview with journalist George Plimpton, Angelou discusses her writing process, and \\"the sometimes slippery notion of truth in nonfiction\\" and memoirs.Rogers, Ronald R. (Spring 2006). \\"Journalism: The Democratic Craft\\". Newspaper Research Journal. When asked if she changed the truth to improve her story, she states, \\"Sometimes I make a diameter from a composite of three or four people, because the essence in only one person is not sufficiently strong to be written about.\\" Angelou has never admitted to changing the facts in her stories. Hagen states, \\"One can assume that 'the essence of the data' is present in Angelou's work\\", and that Angelou uses aspects of fiction writing to make her depictions of events and people more interesting. Angelou's long-time editor, Robert Loomis, said that she could rewrite any of her books by changing the order of her facts to make a different impact on the reader.Hagen, p. 18. The Heart of a Woman is similar to Angelou's previous volumes because it is narrated from the intimate point of view of a woman and a mother, but by this time, she can refer to events that occurred in her past books. Angelou has become a serial autobiographer, something Lupton calls \\"a narrative structure unsurpassed in American autobiography\\". Angelou successfully draws upon her previous works, and can build upon the themes she has already explored;Lupton (1998), p. 116. for example, Angelou threatens the gang leader who has been threatening her son, a powerful incident when considered in light of Angelou's rape in I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings. Lupton calls Angelou's violent behavior an \\"unconscious effort to rewrite her own history\\".  Style  Angelou describes her impressions of alt=An African-American man in his forties, wearing glasses and a suit and tie, sitting and looking to the right, with his hand resting on his right temple Angelou does not begin to create her own narrative until The Heart of a Woman,Lupton, p. 114. which depends less upon the conventions of fiction than her previous books. For example, there is less dialog and fewer dramatic episodes. The Heart of a Woman is more uplifting than its predecessors due to Angelou's resolution of her conflict between her duties as a mother and her success as a performer. Angelou perfects the use of the vignette in The Heart of a Woman to present her acquaintances and close associates. Two of her most developed vignettes in this book are of Billie Holiday and Malcolm X.Lupton (1998), p. 134. The vignettes of those she knew well, like Vusumzi Make, also present her interactions and relationships. Hagen writes that although \\"frank talk seemed to be almost requisite for a commercially successful book\\" in the early 1980s,Hagen, p. 102. Angelou values monogamy, fidelity, and commitment in her relationships. For the only time in this series, Angelou describes her son's accident in detail at both the end of this book and the beginning of her next one, All God's Children Need Traveling Shoes, a technique that centralizes the two books, connects them with each other, creates a strong, emotional link between them, and repeats Angelou's pattern of ending each book on a positive note.O'Neale, Sondra (1984). \\"Reconstruction of the Composite Self: New Images of Black Women in Maya Angelou's Continuing Autobiography\\". In Mari Evans. Black Women Writers (1950–1980): A Critical Evaluation. New York: Doubleday. p. 33. .Lupton (1998), p. 128.Hagen, p. 106. In this book, Angelou ends with a hopeful look to the future as her son attains his independence and she looks forward to hers. Hagen writes, \\"Faithful to the ongoing themes of survival, sense of self, and continuing education, The Heart of a Woman moves its central figures to a point of full personhood.\\"Hagen, p. 107.  Themes  = Race = Race, like in the rest of the series, is a central theme in The Heart of a Woman. The book opens with Angelou and Guy living in an experimental commune with white people, trying to participate in the new openness between Blacks and whites. She is not completely comfortable with the arrangement; Angelou never names her roommates, even though \\"naming\\" has been an important theme in her books thus far. For the most part, Angelou is able to get along well with whites, but she occasionally encounters prejudice, as when she needs help from white friends to rent a home in a segregated neighborhood.Lupton (1998), p. 121. Hagen calls Angelou's descriptions of whites and the hopes for eventual equality in this book \\"optimistic\\".Hagen, p. 104. Angelou continues her indictment of white power structure and her protests against racial injustice.Hagen, pp. 104–105. Angelou becomes more politicized and develops a new sense of Black identity.McPherson, p. 91. Even Angelou's decision to leave show business is political.McPherson, p. 92. She sees herself as a social and cultural historian of her time, and of the civil rights and Black literary movement of the late 1950s and early 1960s.McPherson, p. 93. She becomes more attracted to the causes of Black militants in the US and Africa, to the point of entering into a relationship with a significant militant, and becomes more committed to activism. During this time, she becomes an active political protester, but she does not think of herself in that way. She places the focus upon herself and uses the autobiographical form to demonstrate how the civil rights movement influenced her. According to Hagen, Angelou's contributions to civil rights as a fundraiser and SCLC organizer were successful and \\"eminently effective\\".Hagen, pp. 103–104. = Journey = alt=White male in his mid- thirties, wearing a light-colored polo shirt, standing and looking to the left, with his arms crossed Travel is a common theme in American autobiography as a whole; McPherson writes that it is something of a national myth to Americans as a people.McPherson, p. 121. This is also the case for African- American autobiography, which has its roots in the slave narrative. The Heart of a Woman has three primary settings—the San Francisco Bay Area, New York, and Egypt—and two secondary ones—London and Accra.Lupton (1998), pp. 128–129. Like all of Angelou's books, the structure of The Heart of a Woman is based on a journey. Angelou emphasizes the theme of movement by opening her book with a spiritual (\\"The ole ark's a-moverin'\\"), which McPherson calls \\"the theme song of the United States in 1957\\". This spiritual, which contains a reference to Noah's Ark, presents Angelou as a type of Noah and demonstrates her spirituality. Angelou mentions Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac's 1951 novel On the Road, thus connecting her own journey and uncertainty about the future with the journeys of literary figures.Lupton (1998), pp. 118–119. Even though Angelou travels to Africa for a relationship, she makes a connection with the continent. Lupton states, \\"Africa is the site of her growth\\".Lupton (1998), p. 127. Angelou's time in Africa makes her more aware of her African roots as she searches for the past of her ancestors. Although Angelou journeys to many places in the book, the most important journey she describes is \\"a voyage into the self\\". = Writing = alt=African-American woman, in her late thirties, sitting in a courtroom, looking worryingly to the right. She is wearing a feather hat, a dark coat, and a large ring on her right hand resting upon the witness stand. Angelou's primary role in Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas was stage performer, but in The Heart of a Woman she changes from someone who uses others' method of expression—the songs and dances of the African, Caribbean, and African-American oral tradition—to a writer. Angelou makes this decision for political reasons as she becomes more involved with the civil rights movement, and so that she can care for her son. For the first time in Angelou's autobiographies, she begins to think of herself as a writer and recounts her literary development.Lupton (1999), p. 142. Angelou begins to identify with other Black women writers for the first time in The Heart of a Woman. She has been influenced by several writers since her childhood, but this is the first time she mentions female authors. Up to this point, her identification has been with male writers; her new affiliations with female writers is due to her emerging feminism. Angelou's concept of herself as an artist changed after her encounter with Billie Holiday. Up to that point, Angelou's career was more about fame than about art; Als states, \\"Developing her artistry was not the point\\". Als also says that Angelou's busy career, instead of revealing her ambition, shows \\"a woman who is only moderately talented and perpetually unable to understand who she is\\". Angelou, in spite of the mistakes of her youth, needed the approval and acceptance of others, and observes that Holiday was able to perceive this. Holiday tells her, \\"You're going to be famous. But it won't be for singing.\\"Angelou, p. 19. Angelou had begun to write sketches, songs and short stories, and shows her work to her friend John Killens, who invites her to New York City to develop her writing skills. She joins the Harlem Writers Guild and receives feedback from other African-American authors such as Killens, Rosa Guy, and Caribbean writer Paule Marshall, who would eventually make significant contributions to African-American literature. Angelou dedicates herself to improving her craft, forcing herself to understand the technical aspects of writing. Lupton writes, \\"Readers can actually envision in this volume the distinguished artist who becomes the Maya Angelou of the 1990s\\".Lupton (1998), p. 122. = Motherhood = Motherhood, a theme throughout Angelou's autobiographies, becomes more complex in The Heart of a Woman. Although Guy struggles with the developmentally appropriate process of adolescent separation from his mother, they remain close.Lupton (1998), p. 130. Many years of experience as a mother, and her success as a writer, actress, and activist, enable Angelou to behave more competently and with more maturity, professionally and as a mother. Her self-assurance becomes a major part of her personality. Her past conflict between her professional and personal lives are resolved, and she fulfills her promise to Guy she made to him at the end of her previous autobiography that they would never be separated again.Lupton (1998), p. 120. Lupton writes that Angelou resolves this conflict by subordinating her needs to her child's. Lupton also writes that motherhood is important in Angelou's books, as is \\"the motif of the responsible mother\\". Angelou's commitment to caring for her son is revealed in her confrontation with the street gang leader who has threatened Guy. In this episode, which Lupton considers the most dramatic in the book, Angelou has become a powerful mother. Angelou is no longer torn by self-doubt, but is now a strong and aggressive Black mother. Angelou has become what Joanne M. Braxton calls the \\"outraged mother\\", which represents the Black mother's strength and dedication found throughout slave narratives. Lupton also writes that Angelou has become a reincarnation of her grandmother, a central figure in Caged Bird. By the end of The Heart of a Woman, Angelou is alone; for example, after Guy recuperates from the car accident, he leaves her to attend college. The final word in the book is the negative \\"myself\\", a word that signifies Angelou's new-found freedom and independence. Angelou has become truly herself and is no longer defined as someone's wife or mother.Lupton (1998), p. 131. Scholar Wallis Tinnie calls this moment one of \\"illusive transcendence\\" and \\"a scene of hope and completion\\".Tinnie, Wallis (2002). \\"Maya Angelou\\". In Carolyn Perry and Mary Louise Peaks. The History of Southern Women's Literature. Baton Route, Louisiana: Louisiana State University Press. p. 521. . For the first time in many years, Angelou will be able to eat a chicken breast alone, something that is valued throughout her books. Lupton calls this thought \\"perfectly formed\\".Lupton (1999), p. 143. Tinnie states that The Heart of a Woman's \\"lonely aching\\" hearkens back to the poem that inspired the book's title.  Critical reception and sales  Maya Angelou reciting her poem \\"On the Pulse of Morning\\" at President alt=African- American woman in her fifties, wearing a dark coat, standing at a podium reading to a crowd gathered behind her Critics gave The Heart of a Woman positive reviews, praising its professional qualities.Hagen, p. 97. The American Library Association's Choice magazine says that although Caged Bird was the best of Angelou's autobiographies, \\"every book since has been very much worth the reading and pondering\\".\\"Maya Angelou's The Heart of a Woman\\". (January 1982). Choice 19: 621. Janet B. Blundell writes that the book was \\"lively, revealing, and worth the reading\\", but also found it \\"too chatty and anecdotal\\".Blundell, Janet B. (October 1981). \\"Maya Angelou's The Heart of a Woman\\". Library Journal 106: 1919. Hagen responded to this criticism by stating that all of Angelou's books consist of episodes connected by theme and character. Sheree Crute, writing for Ms., appreciated the episodic nature of Angelou's writing and praised her for her \\"wonderfully unaffected story telling skills\\".Crute, Sheree (July 1981). \\"The Heart of a Woman\\". Ms. 10: 27. Cudjoe called it \\"the most political segment of Angelou's autobiographical statement\\".Cudjoe, p. 297. In 1993, Angelou recited her poem \\"On the Pulse of Morning\\" at President Bill Clinton's inauguration; in the following week, sales of her works, including The Heart of a Woman, rose by 300–600 percent. Bantam Books printed 400,000 copies of her books to meet demand. Random House, which published Angelou's hardcover books and the poem later that year, reported that they sold more of her books in January 1993 than they did in all of 1992, marking a 1,200 percent increase. In 1997, Angelou's friend Oprah Winfrey named The Heart of a Woman as a selection in her book club, making it a bestseller and increasing its total printing to over one million copies, sixteen years after its publication.Maryles, Daisy (08 September 1997). \\"Behind the Bestsellers\\".

The book was chosen as an Oprah's Book Club selection in 1997, and the paperback edition subsequently made the Publishers Weekly and New York Times bestseller lists.  Plot  Adolescent Ninah lives in a strict fundamentalist Christian community (The Church of Fire and Brimstone and God's Almighty Baptizing Wind) led by her grandfather Herman. The community is governed by a series of strict rules covering everything from drinking to speaking to people outside of the community, with punishments ranging from sleeping on stinging nettles to spending a night in a grave. Despite the rules, Ninah cannot stop herself from falling in love with James, a boy a year older who is also her nephew by marriage. The community allows Ninah and James to become \\"prayer partners\\" in order that they can spend time with one another in the hopes of a future marriage. James and Ninah pray for Jesus to speak through them in order to help them defeat their attraction for one another, but eventually, their physical attraction is too strong, and Ninah becomes pregnant. James, fearing punishment from the community, commits suicide. Ninah insists that Jesus, rather than James, is the father of the baby. During her pregnancy, Ninah mulls over her feelings toward God and decides that her experience of God's love is closer to her feelings toward James than to the attitude of her church. However, when the baby is born with its palms attached in an attitude of prayer, the entire community is convinced that baby Canaan is the new Messiah.  Characters  * Ninah is a passionate, thoughtful young woman who strives to be a good daughter and a good Christian, but questions the rules of her strict religious society. *Grandpa Herman is the pastor of \\"The Church of Fire and Brimstone and God's Almighty Baptizing Wind.\\" He makes up all the community's rules and strictly enforces their punishments. * James is Ninah's lover. He and Ninah grew up together. * Nanna is Ninah's grandmother, who arranges for Ninah and James to spend time together as \\"prayer partners\\". * Ajita is Ninah's schoolmate, whose family members are adherents of Hinduism. * Canaan is Ninah's infant son. When he is born, he comes out with his hands sealed together. Everyone thinks he is the new Messiah and that the rapture will come in his lifetime.  Reception  Upon its release the book received mixed reviews. Writing for The New York Times, Zofia Smardz praised Reynolds for writing \\"a truly rapturous love story\\" with \\"two unforgettable characters\\" but also criticized her for leaving \\"a curious blank at the heart of her novel by sidestepping the motivations of the church's zealous patriarch\\". In the Los Angeles Times, novelist Sandra Scofield observed that Reynolds \\"has accomplished something unique\\" but also found her characterization of Ninah unsatisfactory, noting that \\"Ninah's waffling stretches credibility, as if Reynolds didn't quite decide what Ninah ought to believe\\". M. J. McAteer of The Washington Post observed that the author \\"often has too heavy a hand\\" and concluded that \\"Reynolds would do better to let readers pick up the threads themselves\\". In 1997 Oprah Winfrey selected The Rapture of Canaan for Oprah's Book Club, with Reynolds appearing in a 15-minute television segment discussing the book. The book became both a Publishers Weekly and New York Times bestseller.

When he was still an infant, his family moved to his mother's home state of North Carolina. When his family moved to Washington, D.C., for his father’s job, Scancarelli became the target of bullies in school.

In the early 1960s he also worked as an artist in WBTV’s (the CBS-affiliated television station in Charlotte, North Carolina) graphics department, where he would design sets and props, and draw images on the weather maps. He also would act on occasion, and wrote and voiced episodes of The Yellowjacket, a regular five-minute drive-time radio segment on WBT-FM influenced by the Batman show. Scancarelli had a successful career as a freelance magazine illustrator, and he did slide transparency art until computers made that job obsolete.National Cartoonists Society Gasoline Alley Scancarelli says his deep appreciation for comics was cultivated during childhood visits to his grandfather's house. His grandfather read the strips to him and pointed out details in each panel. His earliest comic strip recollection is of Gasoline Alley. He now lives in that same house and notes, \\"Little did I know that 50 years later I’d be working on the comic strip in the next room.\\" Scancarelli spoke about EC Comics and his other early influences in a 1997 interview with Jeffrey Lindenblatt: :The first things I really got enamored with were Foster’s Prince Valiant, Li’l Abner, Roy Crane. Crane still sticks with me a lot. But the guys who hit me over the head hardest, when I got to be 13 years old, were Wally Wood, Jack Davis and Bill Elder on Mad. They were phenomenal! I couldn’t believe anyone could draw like that... I remember picking up an EC comic, Weird Science or Weird Fantasy, and Wally Wood drew some of the most beautiful women I’d ever seen—in spacesuits, or almost spacesuits—I couldn’t believe anyone could render planets and moons and space vehicles with this degree of realism. It drove me crazy, and I would sit around and try to draw stuff like that. I think then my mother prohibited me from reading EC for a while. Then Mad came along, and I would try to copy that stuff.

Cohen Scancarelli began his professional association with Gasoline Alley as an assistant to Dick Moores in 1979. Moores sent him the strips fully penciled with the faces inked, and Scancarelli would finish the inking. Although other artists had auditioned for the role, Scancarelli claims his advantage was that he was \\"the only one who read the strip and knew the characters.\\" When Moores died in 1986, Scancarelli succeeded him as creator. In 1988, Scancarelli created a sequence wherein Walt Wallet made copies of the Wallet Family Tree. Walt then broke the fourth wall and offered a copy to each reader who sent a self-addressed stamped envelope. It was Scancarelli himself who had to fulfill the requests, which numbered almost 100,000, with copies printed at his personal expense.Horn, Maurice. 100 Years of American Newspaper Comics: An Illustrated Encyclopedia. New York: Gramercy Books, 1996. The strip's lettering is unique in that it uses upper and lower case, although almost all strips follow the tradition of upper case only. Scancarelli also takes the unusual approach of combining continuity storylines with daily gags. He is the strip's sole creator, as he explained to Lindenblatt: :I do love it. The deadlines are the only thing I don’t love about it... Dick Moores used to say that if he didn’t have the strip, he’d be dead. The bad thing is, he did have the strip, and he did die... Once in a while, Mark Cohen will write a poem or give me an idea for a Sunday page, but I do the rest of it. I stare at a blank sheet of paper and come up with it. (Cohen died in 1999. Scancarelli remembered him with a 2009 Sunday page tribute.) Scancarelli eschews the use of computers in his work, creating Gasoline Alley using the traditional India ink pen and brush techniques and materials of his predecessors on the strip. Daily strips are composed on bristol paper 15 inches by 5 inches, allowing him room for details that will see publication at much smaller size. Having also collaborated with NCS president George Breisacher on Mutt and Jeff, Scancarelli became the only cartoonist to be involved with two strips on their 75th anniversaries.Daryl Cagles's Political Cartoonists Index Scancarelli had said he hoped to shepherd Gasoline Alley to its 100th anniversary (which came in 2018), and he successfully reached and continued past that milestone.

The novel was selected as the fourth book for Oprah's Book Club in December 1996. Lamb's novel was named a finalist for the 1992 Los Angeles Book Awards' Art Seidenbaum Prize for first fiction. She's Come Undone has been translated into eighteen languages. Plot summary Dolores Price is heartbroken when her handsome, but irresponsible father, Tony, leaves their suburban home for another woman. She and her mother, Bernice, move into her uptight Catholic grandmother's house in Easterly, Rhode Island. It is here where Dolores finds herself an outsider in the adolescent social hierarchy at the Catholic school she attends. Not long after being raped by a charming neighbor, Jack Speight, Dolores turns to food and television for comfort. By the age of 17, Dolores weighs 250 pounds. Following the accidental death of her mother, Dolores decides to attend the academically underwhelming Merton College in Pennsylvania. There Dolores is ridiculed for her weight and cultivates a secret obsession with her roommate's long-distance boyfriend, Dante, who sends love letters and nude photos in the mail. After an ill-conceived one-night stand with Dottie, the university's lesbian custodian, she takes a long cab ride to Cape Cod, where she witnesses a beached whale dying. She feels kinship with the animal and wades into the water to drown herself. After her suicide attempt, Dolores is institutionalized for seven years in Newport, Rhode Island at Gracewood. Here she begins to work through her issues with the help of her therapist. She loses over 100 pounds, but becomes frustrated with the slow- moving therapy. She decides to move to Vermont, where she has located Dante, the object of her college obsession. Dolores gets a job at a local grocery store and moves into an apartment across the hallway from Dante. He is working as a high school English teacher, but is frustrated with the stagnation in his life after having given up his youthful goal to become a priest. They begin a relationship, and eventually marry. However, Dante continues to dominate Dolores and has affairs with his female students. When Dolores becomes pregnant (something she dearly wanted) Dante pressures her into getting an abortion. After the loss of her baby, Dolores becomes resentful of the control Dante exerts over her life. After her grandmother, Thelma, dies, she admits to Dante that she orchestrated their entire relationship after becoming infatuated with him through his photos. They divorce and Dolores leaves. She moves into her late grandmother's house, which she has inherited. At her grandmother's funeral, Dolores is able to reconnect with several friends from her past, who form a surrogate family for her in Easterly. They encourage her to pursue her dreams, and she enrolls in some college courses while working. Here she meets Thayer, a single father, who is immediately smitten with her despite her troubled past. Initially Dolores rebuffs his advances, but is charmed when he sends his teenage son to recite a rap about how much he likes her. They begin a tentative romance, predicated on Dolores's desire to have a child. Dolores realizes that for the first time, she has a partner in her life whom she can trust and who will treat her as an equal. Thayer supports her as she receives IVF treatment, but they do not have enough money for a second attempt after the first one fails. By now, Dolores is in her late 30s and is depressed by the idea that she will never be a mother. Thayer, now her husband, takes her on a whale watching vacation to help her feel better. While on the boat, Dolores muses about her past and future. Dolores decides that her life, as it is now, is wonderful and is enough. The novel ends with her being the only one to see a whale breach the ocean symbolizing her newfound peace.

The first indications of the formation of a disturbance were first noted on 5 October in the Caribbean Sea, but little else was known until the storm approached Cuba on 10 October. There, it brought extreme winds and the lowest known atmospheric pressure of the time – 938 mbar (27.70 inHg) – a record which remained unbroken until the development of a later cyclone in 1924. It soon curved toward Florida, where it maintained its intensity, continuing to rapidly hasten northward along the East Coast of the United States to New England. It entered an extratropical transition while situated over New York on 13 October, producing intense Category 2-force winds and unusually little precipitation. Eventually, the gale dissipated over the Canadian Maritimes the following day as a markedly weaker storm. In Cuba, the storm caused hundreds of deaths, capsized dozens of ships, obliterated buildings, uprooted trees, and ruined crops. Many towns were wholly destroyed or flattened and never recovered, while others disappeared entirely. Damage in the United States was considerably better- chronicled despite being less severe. In Key West, widespread destruction was noted, with 40 deaths, many vessels rendered unfit, and widespread structural damage, with several buildings swept off of their foundations and hundreds of others flattened. Few supplies arrived in the following days and relief efforts were gradual, with few resources within the town's vicinity. Along other sections of the Southeastern U.S. coast, copious rainfall and moderate winds impacted agriculture, shipping, and residences. As the storm tracked along the Middle-Atlantic coast, similar effects were reported: there, the gale inundated many areas, impeded communications, destroyed railroads and canals, and flattened structures. Despite extensive damage, only two deaths were recorded outside Cuba and Florida. Along its entire track, the hurricane caused $338,000 in losses and at least 164 deaths. Unusual in many aspects, the 1846 Havana hurricane was the most intense of its time. Though atmospheric pressure readings in Cuba reached as low as 916 mbar (27.06 inHg), the meteorological historian Jose Fernandez-Partagás re-evaluated several possible pressure records, concluding that the cyclone's minimum pressure was likely closer to 938 mbar (27.70 inHg); even so, it maintained the title of having the lowest recorded pressure measurement until 1924, 78 years later. Although no reliable wind measurements were available at the time, a separate study also estimated that it produced Category 5-strength winds, making it the first known storm to strike Cuba at such an intensity. As a result of the tropical cyclone's extreme intensity, ecological and geographical features were permanently altered in many areas. Sand Key, which completely submerged during the course of the hurricane, wholly re-emerged by December of that year, albeit not in its original position; meanwhile, ecological damage remained evident for decades in Key West.  Meteorological history  The hurricane's origins can be traced to the central Caribbean Sea on 5 October.Chenoweth 2006, p. 234 The following day, its passage south of Jamaica was observed,Tannehill 1938, p. 156 and soon later, the hurricane transited across the Cayman Islands, producing relatively high winds. During the late evening of 10 October, winds began to increase on the island of Cuba, culminating the following morning; while the strongest winds were originally in the storm's northeastern sector, they were later noted in its northwest. Its eye presumably passed slightly east of Havana while maintaining an atmospheric pressure of 916 mbar (27.06 inHg).Ludlum 1963, p. 151 This was accompanied by Category 5-force winds on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale,Landsea et al. 2012, p. 883 defined as 1-minute maximum sustained winds of at least 157 mph (252 km/h). Despite the reading, a 1993 analysis by weather historian José Fernández-Partagás calculated a corrected sea-level pressure at 938 mbar (27.70 inHg); even so, the value maintained the hurricane as the most intense in recorded history.Partagás 1993, p. 1 It arrived at Key West the morning of 11 October, soon after its departure from Cuba, with undiminished intensity. The storm gradually meandered toward Tampa Bay, and eventually arrived on that afternoon of 11 October, its effects persisting through the following morning.Ludlum 1963, p. 152 Winds, which initially swept northeasterly at force 4 during the early evening, veered toward the southeast and peaked at force 8 the following morning. Weather historian David Ludlum tracked the hurricane's path past Cedar Key, noting the disturbance's northeastward curve as it neared Jacksonville.Ludlum 1963, p. 153 Advancing northward over land, the once-powerful hurricane weakened, with somewhat higher atmospheric pressures and winds of less severity reported at Charleston, South Carolina. Paralleling the coast while situated inland, it hastened quickly toward the north, swiftly passing through North Carolina and arriving in the Chesapeake Bay region by 13 October. Southeasterly gusts persisted as the storm continued its northerly progression inland along the course of the East Coast of the United States. After reaching Washington, D.C., in the early morning, it arrived near New York City by sunrise, and transited across Boston during the afternoon of 13 October. The storm likely underwent an extratropical transition by the time it arrived in New York state, elongating linearly east-to-west.Ludlum 1963, p. 94 The gale's winds swept toward the southeast with a brief hiatus in the early evening. As it neared New England, it produced little precipitation yet intense gusts, which peaked at force 9-strength in the vicinity of New Bedford, Massachusetts.Ludlum 1963, p. 95 The cyclone's diameter over New England, at its largest point, reached , accompanied by Category 2-force winds.Boose et al. 2001, p. 40 The system was last sighted on the morning of 14 October, rapidly weakening as it meandered into the Canadian Maritimes.  Impact  In Cuba, the hurricane's impact was extremely severe: the storm destroyed nearly a hundred ships and likely killed hundreds of individuals across the island, and also inflicted extensive crop damage and widespread flooding. The hurricane capsized nearly all crafts docked at Havana Harbor, and of the 104 boats in the harbor prior to the storm's arrival, only 12 remained after it subsided. Between 40 and 50 other cargo vessels were impaired, with significant structural damage in the city proper also observed. Damage to houses, crops, and shipping was catastrophic throughout the island; the storm was reportedly the worst in Cuban history at the time,Schwartz 2007, p. 16 more severe even than an earlier hurricane in 1844. Waves were high enough to reach the lanterns of the Morro Castle lighthouse. While no concrete death toll was established, reports indicated the deaths of several dozen individuals during the entire course of the storm,Malcolm 2010, p. 3 while other records noted that hundreds of deaths had possibly occurred across the island. Damage in the United States, however, was better-documented. There, the disturbance washed away the island of Sand Key and resulted in the loss of many vessels in nearby Key West harbor. Its storm surge scattered debris throughout the city and swept many structures afloat upon high waters. In all, approximately $200,000 in damage and 40 deaths were reported, representing four percent of the town's population. Elsewhere in the state, damage remained severe, with abnormal storm tides and widespread property destruction noted. Shipping and agriculture took the brunt of the storm's impact in other southeastern states; there, it produced damage similar to that inflicted by an earlier 1824 hurricane. Even farther north along the Middle-Atlantic coast, copious rainfall and intense gusts were observed, especially in the New England region. Winds uprooted trees, cracked canals, damaged railroads, and demolished factories. Rainfall totals, however, were generally low, indicative of a dry gale. In all, the hurricane caused at least 164 deaths and $338,000 (1846 USD) in damage throughout its path, although some reports indicated hundreds of additional deaths across the island of Cuba. = Caribbean Sea = alt=A mostly black-and-white map depicting several regions of a city Early in its development, the hurricane passed near the Cayman Islands, inundating all of Grand Cayman, with its worst effects concentrated at the localities of Savannah and Newlands, both under a storm surge. Although residential damage was minimal, many grasslands were destroyed.Williams 1992, p. 73 Celebrations coinciding with the birthday of Isabella II of Spain held in Havana, Cuba, on 10 October were disrupted by heavy rains and strong winds, indicative of the hurricane's imminent arrival that evening.Pérez 2001, p. 67 Following the storm's landfall, the most severe damage as a result of the storm was observed from eastern regions of Pinar del Río to western Matanzas. Already soaked by weeks of constant rainfall, with swollen rivers, inundated roads, and spoiled tobacco crops,Pérez 2001, p. 69 existing problems were only further exacerbated; at Paso Real de San Diego, cassava, sweet potato, and other vianda harvests were ruined. In Havana proper, waves battered ships seeking refuge in the city's harbor, grounded, driven away, capsized, and smashed, with much of their cargo, composing of cartons of sugar, bales of tobacco, and fragments of hemp, barrels, and cases strewn along the shore and sea. In all, the gale destroyed or seriously damaged 105 commercial ships, 70 sloops, pilot boats, and military craft, as well as 111 other vessels at sea;Pérez 2001, p. 70 as a result, shortages of many essential goods occurred in inland provinces. Damage in Cuban port cities was only further aggravated by the amount of debris produced by the destruction of ships, warehouses, and docks, which were in turn blown into harborside structures by powerful gusts.Pérez 2001, p. 71 Masonry buildings bore the brunt of the storm, with the recently overhauled Teatro Principal wholly obliterated, the city gas plant rendered unusable after its smokestack crumpled, and numerous churches flattened. Havana Cathedral experienced considerable damage to its roof, while the Montserrat Church was completely unroofed. The hurricane destroyed parish churches at Jesus del Monte and Guanabacoa, while several hospitals, including the Real Hospital de San Lázaro, were also demolished, with its entrance wrecked, several wards and its infirmary building damaged, and its roofs crippled. Damage was so severe that some believed that the destruction was wrought by an earthquake. Residential damage was omnipresent, with 1,275 houses razed to the ground and another 1,040 damaged in Guanabacoa alone.Pérez 2001, p. 72 The storm covered streets with planks, tiles, and other debris, uprooted and defoliated palm trees, ruined gardens, and damaged balconies.Pérez 2001, p. 73 The massive storm surge associated with the system annihilated and washed away most of the huts and houses of Batabanó, with only 20 left standing. Food and water supplies were lost, while the retreating tides left behind inches of mud and mounds of debris in their wake.Pérez 2001, p. 74 At Caimito and Rosario, warehouses, their contents, piers, and wharves were all driven out into the neighboring ocean, and both towns were entirely flattened. The hurricane destroyed all the piers and nearly every building in Cabañas, and of the 23 houses built in Cojimar, only seven weathered the storm. A majority of ships at Matanzas were destroyed, with numerous ships capsized or washed aground. Massive waves crashed ashore, crushing buildings and inundating low-lying areas in the city. Many wooden and stone buildings, already impaired by an earlier hurricane in 1844, were immediately destroyed by the surge's impact. Structures along the shoreline, in addition to towns along the courses of the Yumurí and San Juan rivers, were driven out to sea. More than forty deaths occurred in the first round of flooding brought by the storm. At Güines, the tempest wrecked all of the town's residences, public buildings, and businesses, and over a hundred individuals died. Among the losses were two distilleries, a packing plant, a lumbermill, and a warehouse, and countless other buildings, while at Pinar del Río, flooding along mountainsides and nearby rivers swamped the city and other nearby communities.Pérez 2001, p. 75 alt=A black-and-white image of a lighthouse Not a single residence remained undamaged after the hurricane's passage in Bejucal, San Antonio de los Baños, Santiago de Las Vegas, and Mariel, and those that were not destroyed were unroofed. Nueva Paz suffered the loss of 110 homes, while Madruga lost 100; only five remained standing at Managua, and of the eight left at Quivicán, all were severely damaged. At Jibacoa, only 32 of the town's 82 residences survived the storm. The seaside town of Guanabo was entirely lost, with floodwaters driving the town to sea and leaving its residents homeless. The hamlets of Mantilla, La Chorrera, and Paula disappeared entirely, while Candelaria was washed away with the loss of all its structures, of which a majority collapsed under the strength of the storm's powerful winds before being driven out to sea. Most structures in Cayajabos, Boyeros, and Aguacate were flattened, while the villages of Alquízar, Güira de Melena, and Vereda Nueva essentially vanished after the storm passed through. Guatao was entirely destroyed, suffering the loss of its apparently indestructible church, while Quemado wholly vanished and only four houses endured the storm's impacts at San Antonio de los Baños. = Southeastern United States = alt=A sketch detailing damage caused by the 1846 hurricane. The impacts of the hurricane were extreme throughout the state of Florida, especially in the Florida Keys. High winds washed away two lighthouses near Key West, resulting in the deaths of all 16 people at Sand Key Light and 14 individuals at the Key West Lighthouse; although keeper Barbara Mabrity survived, seven of her children died while taking refuge there during the hurricane.De Wire 1995, p. 124 The -storm surge in Key West proper swept through downtown and forced many to abandon their homes; many attempted to flee to higher ground (\\"the highest piece of land -- seventeen feet high, with waves threatening to push them off\\") but were still killed or injured. All wharves and warehouses in the town suffered some degree of damage, and of the approximately six hundred residences on the key, only six endured the storm's fury successfully, with the others unroofed or flattened by intense winds. Fort Zachary Taylor, partially obliterated by the hurricane, endured over $200,000 in damage, while the nearby customs-house was also harmed. Uprooted trees and debris from destroyed houses rendered roads impassable. The storm also changed the landscape within the vicinity, washing away Sand Key entirety. However, the island quickly resurfaced by that December, albeit west of its original position.Malcolm 2010, p. 10 Every vessel at local harbor sustained serious damage; in addition, some 20 vessels were unaccounted for, and at least 40 deaths were documented, though another source suggested 50 lives were lost out at sea.Barnes 2007, p. 60 An additional twelve died inland as a result death by being impaled, crushed, or drowned.Malcolm 2010, p. 9 Powerful winds and the storm's massive flood tide washed lumber and casks aboard ships. Massive pieces of timber, hurled across town, cracked walls and inflicted significant damage. Floodwaters deep submerged already debris- clogged streets, with inundation as deep as in the key's northeastern sector. There, the Lafayette Salt Company was swept away along with two military cemeteries. Floodwaters exhumed many skeletons and coffins in those graveyards, dispersing them across local forests. In downtown, both the Episcopal and Methodist chapels collapsed, and warehouses were moderately damaged. The town's new stone marine hospital, struck by the remnants of a wharf and a large raft, was nearly completely destroyed by the storm's intense winds. Lumber, crowbars, and cannon carriages from the construction site of Fort Zachary Taylor were scattered throughout the streets. High waters floated a camp stable from its initial location, floating its horses and mules to safety. Four drowning deaths were chronicled at the fort, all having been swept away from the fort.Malcolm 2010, p. 8 Several wooden buildings along the shoreline, not tethered to the ground, drifted out to sea upon high waters due to the sheer force of the hurricane's gusts.Malcolm 2010, p. 14 Other notable maritime losses were also noted nearby, with the deaths of three on the Lafayette, which capsized offshore, one fatality each upon the Exchange and Frankford, and 19 casualties on the Villa Nueva; in addition, several other abandoned vessels were driven aground, apparently without any loss of life. The storm's path of devastation extended northward through the state. In Manatee County, a plantation owner and his horse drowned attempting to cross the elevated waters of the Little Manatee River. To the north at Fort Brooke, high winds felled several oak trees on the grounds of a local military installation, wholly uprooting several others. Along Tampa Bay, winds obliterated several houses and flattened fences. To the northeast at Jacksonville, the storm was more severe, with the hurricane's winds having been \\"beyond anything in the recollection of ... the oldest inhabitant [of the town].\\" Storm tides exceeded the previously recorded high water mark by , inundating numerous wharves and businesses along the path of Bay Street. By the time the storm's fury abated, the storm tossed wharves out to sea, wrecked structures along the St. Johns River, and rendered nearby saw mills' lumber worthless. Even along other, farther north, portions of the southeastern coast, the gale remained intense. At Savannah, Georgia, one fatality occurred at sea, and damage to fences, roofs, and trees was minor despite high winds, with debris from the remnants of chinaberry trees littering the streets of the city. A schooner capsized at Union Wharf, and farther down the coast at Tybee Island, another craft was washed aground. Within the vicinity of Darien, Georgia, the gale's high tides swamped rice fields, also impeding the impending harvest along the Savannah River in South Carolina.Fraser 2009, p. 119 Although little rain fell farther north at Charleston, with merely measured, gusts leveled wharves, uprooted trees, prostrated fences, and unroofed buildings. Despite copious rainfall measurements at Columbia, which received of rainfall, damage was minimal and, for the most part, restricted to crops. The vessel Mutual Safety departed Charleston in the mid-afternoon of 10 October,Fraser 2009, p. 118 but soon encountered the storm and experienced severe damage. In an effort to save the vessel's passengers, it was deliberately run ashore near Jacksonville, Florida, without the loss of any passengers on board; however, the steamer itself was not salvageable. A dozen ships beached or capsized in Charleston's harbors, with many wharves demolished along the city's shoreline. The western part of Tradd Street, especially near Chisolm's Mill and South Bay's sidewalk, eroded as a result of wind and water, which also fractured the South Bay and East Battery walls. Gusts unroofed the Trinity Church along Hasell Street; the roof itself landed in an adjacent graveyard. Despite extensive damage, only one death was noted in the city, that of a slave whose boat floundered at sea.Fraser 2009, p. 120 Unexpectedly low storm tides of at Georgetown, South Carolina and Wilmington, North Carolina inflicted no noteworthy damage. In general, however, the hurricane was reportedly the most severe since 1824 along the southeastern seaboard. = Mid-Atlantic and Northeast = alt=A colored print map depicting several states and their boundaries Not a single wharf at Baltimore, Maryland escaped the hurricane's storm surge, which inundated the length of Pratt Street along the shore; meanwhile, the Potomac River at Washington, D.C., and Alexandria, Virginia, attained its highest level in 20 years, with the latter two cities plagued by surface runoff on 13 October, following the storm's passage. The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal also bore the brunt of the storm's impact, having been swamped by potent rainfall as well.Schwartz 2007, p. 61 Low-lying areas along the Delaware River, including New Castle, Delaware, experienced storm tides not seen since the 1775 Newfoundland hurricane. The floodwaters were high enough to even extinguish a fire in a stationary locomotive which had been impeded by the gale's rainfall. The local Episcopal Church's steeple was tossed away by forceful gusts. To the north at Philadelphia, the tempest was the most intense in 30 years, with its high tides engulfing every wharf in the city; a total of of rain was measured at Pennsylvania Hospital. Despite widespread destruction along the Delaware River, damage to buildings in Philadelphia proper was less severe. Heavy rainfall was also generated throughout western portions of the state. In neighboring New Jersey, considerable damage to structures, timber, land, and livestock was observed, with winds toppling several buildings and trees; widespread rainfall, meanwhile, flooded salt marshes, also drowning cattle and sheep. High winds tangled poles and wires, in turn interrupting telegraphic communications along the Washington-Baltimore-New York corridor. Damage was similarly severe in New England, despite the storm's transition into a weaker extratropical cyclone. Despite being significantly farther east from New York City, the storm produced severe impacts in the area. Significant damage was observed, with the waters of Upper New York Bay crashing over the Battery Park sea wall, washing away of its length. Gusts caved in chimneys, uprooted trees, and sank several canal boats at the city's wharves. At Buffalo, a rupture along the Erie Canal interrupted nearby traffic, and to the east in Dansville, copious rainfall was also recorded. Approximately of rain accompanied low atmospheric pressure readings throughout a wide area, with winds along the gale's eastern fringes, especially at Cape Cod, Massachusetts, remaining intense. In New England, it was generally considered to be the most severe storm since a previous disturbance in October 1841, despite having produced minimal rainfall totals throughout the region, including at New Bedford. Gusts felled trees paralleling both sides of a roadway from Springfield to Amherst. Nearby at Worcester, winds flattened several factories, and also overturned a substantial number trees in the outskirts of Boston. A newly built brick residence's walls in the southern end of the city collapsed; on the other side of the city, a sawing and planing mill was razed to the ground. Within the proximity of Boston at the towns of Canton and Southborough, winds obliterated two factories. High winds at Grafton collapsed the railroad sheds under the ownership of the Providence and Worcester Railroad. Malden endured the loss of a mansion which was still under construction, and several smaller buildings were also blown down there and at Monson. Winds upturned trees and toppled fences at Northampton, and nearby at Palmer, a school building was crumbled into pieces by intense winds. At Springfield, winds unroofed a repair facility at a local railroad depot and a house at the town armory. Gusts destroyed railroad sheds and factories in Stoughton and Worcester as well, and at Wilmington, winds crumbled a house into pieces. Slightly to the south in Norwich, Connecticut, fallen trees obstructed railroad tracks, and at Hartford, a railroad bridge was thrown farther upstream along the Connecticut River. Further railroad damage was noted to property owned by the Winchester and Potomac, Baltimore and Ohio, and other railroads throughout the region. Nearly all key bridges managed by those railroads were washed away, with many other track segments covered in debris. In all, the hurricane caused at least 164 deaths.  Aftermath and records  alt=A sketch of an island's shape and its dimensions Immediately following the storm's end, the U.S. Army Quartermaster permitted homeless citizens to rest in its local barracks. Food, water, and supplies were lacking, with most having been washed away, rendered unusable, or become inedible due to the storm's salty storm surge. The Morris's captain obtained supplies from a damaged vessel, sending them to a local Methodist minister. Efforts to reconstruct and recover from the disaster were not immediate due to the lack of available resources. With the loss of area lighthouses, local waters were difficult to navigate, with one shipwreck occurring as a result west of Key West; in response, a staff was placed at the former location of the now-destroyed Key West Lighthouse. Many vessels were also lost near Sand Key Light, and decades later, the tower, poorly maintained due to a lack of government funding, continued to deteriorate. The 1846 hurricane resulted in a variety of both geological, geographical, and ecological alterations. In Key West, the local salt pond shifted from its original position, becoming a hindrance to local residents and requiring it to be filled up; eventually, the tourist district of Key West emerged over the former site of the salt pond. By December 1846, Sand Key, which was inundated during the hurricane, resurfaced from the waters of the Atlantic. However, it was situated approximately west of its location prior to the hurricane, and even months later, the lighthouse remained under of seawater. Years afterward, greenery on the key was sparse, and little native vegetation existed. Signs of ecological damage remained even in the early 1880s, evidenced by the presence of rushes among the leaves of trees and bushes.Malcolm 2010, p. 11 The 1846 Havana hurricane was likely of Category 5 intensity, the earliest known tropical cyclone of its strength to strike Cuba. In 1993, the weather historian Jose Fernandez-Partagás analyzed an anomalous atmospheric pressure of 916 mbar (27.06 inHg) measured at Havana upon the vessel Thames, deeming it to be abnormally low and evaluating its true value to be closer to 938 mbar (27.70 inHg), making the hurricane the most intense in recorded history at the time. The exceptionally low pressure reading in Cuba surpassed a previous record of 948 mbar (28.00 inHg) set by an 1844 storm, with the new record eventually exceeded by the 1924 Cuba hurricane, which featured a manually recorded pressure reading of 932 mbar (27.52 inHg).Partagás 1993, p. 4  See also  *List of Florida hurricanes (pre-1900) *List of New England hurricanes  Notes  = Footnotes = = Citations = = References =     * * 1846 Category:1840s Atlantic hurricane seasons 1846 1846 1846 Category:Spanish colonial period of Cuba Hurricane, 1846 Hurricane Havana hurricane Category:1846 natural disasters Category:1846 meteorology ","title":"1846 Havana hurricane"},{"id":"3608390","text":"Royal Air Force Barford St John or RAF Barford St John is a Royal Air Force station just north of the village of Barford St. John, Oxfordshire, England. It is now a non-flying facility, operated by the United States Air Force as a communications centre with many large communications aerials, and is a satellite of RAF Croughton. History RAF Barford St John was opened on 30 July 1941 as a training facility for RAF Flying Training Command. It had three grass runways, used primarily by Airspeed Oxfords of No. 15 Service Flying Training School RAF from RAF Kidlington. The airfield was closed in late 1941 and rebuilt as an RAF Bomber Command airfield with paved runways and equipped for night operations. The airfield reopened in December 1942 as a satellite for RAF Upper Heyford. Bomber Command and No. 16 Operational Training Unit was stationed there with Vickers Wellingtons until December 1944. No. 1655 Mosquito Training Unit RAF replaced the Wellingtons and the unit was renamed No. 16 OTU in January 1945 when it moved to RAF Cottesmore. In 1943 the station served as flight test centre for its Gloster E.28/39 and Gloster Meteor jet aircraft from RAF Brockworth. After the war the airfield was closed in 1946 and placed into care and maintenance. The site was used for some background filming for the 1949 film Twelve O'Clock High. The following units were also here at some point: * No. 4 Squadron RAF * No. 21 Heavy Glider Conversion Unit RAF * No. 169 Squadron RAF * No. 170 Squadron RAF USAF use In 1951 the United States Air Force opened a communications (transmitter) centre on the airfield, reporting to the 2130th Communications Group (UK Communications Region) at RAF Croughton. Given its postwar use by the military, all its runways, perimeter track and hardstands still exist but the World War II buildings have been removed, being replaced by modern buildings on the airfield, secured and guarded with fencing and other security devices. Simon Duke's U.S. Military Forces and Installations in Europe (SIPRI, 1989) lists the base as housing a Giant Talk/Scope Signal III transmitter annex for RAF Croughton (p.314).

It was chosen as an Oprah's Book Club selection in December 1998. Plot introduction Where the Heart Is follows the lives of Novalee Nation, Willy Jack Picken, and their daughter Americus Nation for a period of seven years in the 1980s and early 1990s. Above all, the book dramatizes in detail the tribulations of lower- income and foster children in the United States. Plot summary This novel opens with Novalee and Willy Jack, her then boyfriend, traveling from Tennessee to California, where Willy Jack claims he was promised by his cousin, J. Paul, a job working at a train yard. Novalee is 17, seven months pregnant, and superstitious about sevens: at the age of 7, her mother ran off with a baseball umpire named Fred, her best friend in seventh grade was arrested, and a crazy customer at her cafe job cut her from wrist to elbow, which \\"took seventy-seven stitches to close her up.\\" Meanwhile, Willy Jack is hiding from Novalee his plan to lose a finger at the train yard so that he can win a cash settlement, like his cousin did, and not have to work again. Novalee makes Willy Jack place his hand on her stomach so that he can feel the baby's heartbeat - Willy Jack insists he feels nothing, and continues to treat Novalee and her pregnancy with annoyed indifference. Novalee convinces Willy Jack to stop at a Walmart in Sequoyah, Oklahoma, so she can use the restroom and purchase a pair of sandals, as hers fell through the floor of their beat- up car due to her feet being swollen. When Novalee comes out of the Walmart, she realizes Willy Jack has left her with nothing more than her beach bag and the $7.77 she has in change from the purchase of new sandals. With nowhere else to go, Novalee spends the afternoon at the Walmart and meets Sister Thelma Husband, a kind, spunky, and deeply religious older woman who runs the town's Welcome Wagon, and hands out chapters of the Bible to people she meets. Sister Husband initially \\"mistakes\\" Novalee for a girl named Ruth Ann Mott, gives Novalee a Welcome Wagon basket, and invites her to come visit her whenever she likes. Novalee also meets Moses Whitecotton, a photographer who shoots portraits at the Walmart. Moses tells Novalee to give her baby a name \\"that will mean something\\" and \\"withstand a lot of bad times,\\" and gives her a photo album. In addition, she also meets Benny Goodluck, a Native American boy who gives Novalee a buckeye tree for good luck. When the Walmart closes, Novalee initially panics as she is trapped inside of the store, but as it provides her with temporary shelter, takes refuge there. Meanwhile, Willy Jack continues on his way to California, but quickly runs out of money and gas. He stops at a local dive bar and meets Jolene, the bar owner's teenage daughter. Willy Jack convinces Jolene that he's a musician on his way to Las Vegas who had his wallet and license stolen - she agrees to use her own money to fix up his car, on the condition that he takes her to Vegas with him. Upon their departure, they're almost immediately pulled over by the police, who suspect Willy Jack of being responsible for a theft at a nearby convenience store. The police find fourteen cartons of stolen cigarettes in the trunk of his car. When Willy Jack protests, Jolene, who had committed the theft but is friendly with the police, further accuses him to cover herself. He is subsequently arrested and sent to jail. As Novalee continues to live in Walmart, she watches as the buckeye tree becomes sick. She takes a walk to the library where she meets Forney Hull, who helps her find books about the buckeye. Forney is from a well-bred family but had to drop out of college to take care of his alcoholic sister, the librarian. Forney comes off as eccentric and standoffish, but agrees to help Novalee as she shows a burgeoning fascination for books and learning. Novalee learns what she needs in order to save her buckeye tree, and takes a walk to Sister Husband's home, who had told Novalee she was welcome to visit her house any time, to ask Sister Husband if she could plant her buckeye on her property. As the weeks pass, Novalee becomes good friends with Forney, Sister Husband, and Sister's companion Mr. Sprock. Forney, who is beginning to fall in love with Novalee, throws her an intimate 18th birthday party in the library, consisting of gourmet dishes he's cooked himself. The celebration is cut short when Forney's alcoholic sister Mary Elizabeth takes a fall upstairs and Forney is forced to come to her aid. Two months after she'd been abandoned, Novalee goes into labor in the middle of the night inside of the closed Walmart. She tries to choose a name for her baby before it comes, but the pain of her labor quickly overtakes her. Forney, who had become only recently aware that she had been living in the store, breaks a window and helps her give birth. After she delivers a baby girl, she recalls Moses Whitecotton's advice on picking a strong name for her child and names her Americus. At the hospital, she befriends her nurse Lexi Coop who has four different children with three different fathers. Novalee soon finds out that she and her baby are famous and in the news, and begins receiving letters and money from strangers in the mail. Sam Walton, the patriarch of the Walton family and owner of the Walmart corporation, comes in to visit Novalee and offer her a job at the store where she gave birth, which Novalee accepts after some hesitation about people's reactions to her. Novalee's mother, Momma Nell, finds out from the television report what had happened and which hospital Novalee is convalescing in, and arrives to offer her support. Novalee is hesitantly grateful to accept the help and hands over the money she'd received from supportive strangers so that her mother can buy what they need for the baby, but the next morning, when Momma Nell doesn't return, Novalee fully accepts that her mother is never returning. Sister Husband eventually collects Novalee and Americus after they're discharged and moves them into the trailer in which she lives. After some adjusting, Novalee start work in the Walmart where she used to live, and is relieved that gossip about her is short-lived. Sister eventually becomes a mother figure to Novalee and her daughter and Novalee's relationships with Moses Whitecotton, Lexi Coop, and Forney Hull are deepened as she becomes a staple figure in Sequoyah. Lexi serves as the first real girlfriend that Novalee has ever had and provides advice and support, while Moses mentors Novalee in photography, and Forney brings her books to support her growing love of learning. The community is brought together to rally around Novalee when, at seven months old, Americus is abducted by an Evangelical couple who forcibly baptize her. Americus is safely returned and the couple is arrested by the police. Meanwhile in prison, Willy Jack suffers at the hands of inmates and guards alike. After suffering a blow to his chest, his heart stops in the middle of the night - while he struggles to restart it, he hears Novalee's voice guiding him to the heartbeat of their unborn baby. He recovers from the ordeal, but thereafter, is often plagued by Novalee's voice, especially when he sleeps. He later manages to charm Claire Hudson, the solemn prison librarian who still mourns her dead son Finny, and uses her grief to his advantage. She eventually gives him her dead son's guitar, a Martin. He teaches himself to play and soon writes a song \\"The Beat of a Heart.\\" Three years later, Novalee continues to study photography alongside Moses Whitecotton, and soon begins to take classes in photography at the local college. She maintains strong friendships with Lexi Coop and Forney Hull, who has taken a sort of fatherly role with Americus as a teacher and mentor. Americus thrives under the care of Novalee, Sister, and Forney, and develops into a precocious child with a deep love of learning. Lexi teases Novalee gently about her relationship with Forney, which Novalee insists is platonic, but Lexi is keenly aware that this isn't the case. During the summer, a massive storm brews in Oklahoma, sending residents scrambling for shelter. Novalee and Americus manage to make it to their storm shelter in time, but Sister Husband, who was visiting a neighbor, is trapped in the trailer by the ensuing tornado. The trailer is destroyed, and to Novalee's tremendous grief, Sister passes away from her injuries several days later in the hospital. The damage from the tornado includes the Walmart, which is leveled to the ground. During her bereavement, Novalee and Americus move in temporarily with Moses and his wife, Certain, as Novalee struggles with the choice of whether to stay in Sequoyah with her family, or to move fifty miles away to Poteau, where the decimated Walmart is being rebuilt in order to keep her job and health insurance. To her great surprise, Novalee learns that Sister left all of her possessions and life insurance in Novalee's name. She decides to remain in Sequoyah and commute to Poteau, and with the insurance money she receives, is able to build a house right where Sister's trailer used to be, and where her buckeye tree is miraculously still standing. Willy Jack is release from prison after a three-year sentence, during which time he became a talented and reputable musician. With Claire Hudson's money and help, he makes his way to Nashville to find an agent, but is quickly dismissed from every reputable agency. He eventually becomes desperate as his money runs out, but finds representation from Ruth Meyers, a no-nonsense agent who agrees to take him on under the condition that he never lie to her. She uses every resource at her disposal to clean up Willy Jack, and gives him the alias \\"Billy Shadow.\\" Billy Shadow's star rises slowly and steadily, but his only real success is in \\"The Beat of a Heart,\\" which becomes a hit after it's recorded by another musician. Willy Jack quickly grows frustrated at what he feels is Ruth Meyer's lack of clout, and tries to go behind her back to find a better agent. But Ruth, who has far more clout and connections than Willy Jack realizes, soon finds out about the plot, disbands his group, cancels his cards and gigs, and effectively ends his career. Novalee continues to struggle with her feelings for Forney, who has become a daily positive presence in hers and Americus's life. Lexi, who is pregnant with her fifth child, points out that Forney has been in love with Novalee for years, but Novalee firmly believes that Forney, who is well-educated and born from wealth, deserves someone better than her. Lexi eventually gives birth to her fifth child, and soon after begins dating a handsome and charming banker named Roger Briscoe. The relationship is short- lived after Roger beats Lexi to within an inch of her life after Lexi discovers him sexually assaulting Brownie (Brummett), her oldest son. Brownie calls Novalee for help, and she rushes to the apartment to discover Lexi beaten and bruised on the bed. As Lexi recovers in the hospital, Novalee moves the Coop family into her tiny house, and cares for the children with the help of her neighbors and Mr. Spock. Lexi is soon released, but she and Brownie become distant and withdrawn as a result of their trauma, and Lexi's guilt over allowing Roger to target her children. Forney's sister Mary Elizabeth soon dies in a fire that burns down Hull Manor and the library. Novalee goes to visit him and offer her support, and they end up making love before Forney leaves for Maine to bury his sister. After Forney leaves, Novalee fully accepts that she loves him, but shows trepidation when Lexi congratulates her. Novalee's doubts about her self-worth manifest when Forney returns home to the news that the rebuilt library will be headed by someone else, leaving him without a home or job. Faced with the prospect of Forney working at a plastics plant, a job Novalee believes is beneath him, she deliberately breaks his heart by telling him she doesn't love him, so that he no longer has any ties to Oklahoma. Forney, heartbroken, leaves Oklahoma and Novalee behind. Over the following few months, Forney sends letters intermittently to Americus, who is equally heartbroken with his departure, with little to no mention of Novalee beyond cursory formalities. Novalee struggles to get over Forney and her guilt at sending him away, justifying her decision with the fact that Forney has more opportunities at a better life without her. Lexi berates Novalee for undervaluing herself, and Novalee makes a single attempt to reconnect with him after she finds the bookstore in Chicago where he now works, but cannot bring herself to tell him the truth. Lexi, meanwhile, befriends a coworker, Leon Yoder after she recovers enough to return to her job. Though she is initially adamant that she does not want a relationship because of her previous experience, he demonstrates tremendous kindness to her and her children. After Lexi learns the story of how one of his two children isn't, in fact, his, but a child he saved from his ex-girlfriend, the mother of his biological child, Lexi falls in love with him and they eventually marry, with Novalee photographing their wedding day. Willy Jack manages to make his way to California after losing his career and spiraling heavily into drugs and alcohol. After failing to get any money from his cousin in Bakersfield, he pawns the Martin, his last possession, in a desperate bid for money. The deal falls through, and Willy Jack is left without his guitar or a penny to his name. He finally drunkenly ditches his current girlfriend and staggers into a nearby train yard where he falls down across the tracks. He is severely injured when both of his legs are amputated at the knee by an oncoming train he failed to notice in his stupor, but the last thing he remembers is Novalee's voice. Americus turns seven years old, and Novalee remains superstitious about sevens and vigilant about what she senses coming. She soon catches, by chance, Willy Jack's name in the newspaper not long after her daughter's birthday, which claimed his wheelchair had been stolen while he was hitchhiking to Oklahoma to find his child. Novalee makes arrangements for her daughter, and makes her way to Alva, where Willy Jack is convalescing. She confronts Willy Jack in his hospital room and demands to know why he was trying to find her. Willy Jack confesses to Novalee that he did feel the baby's heartbeat the last day that they were together, and that he periodically called her home from time to time to hear Americus's voice. When Novalee asks him why he lied about the baby's heartbeat, Willy Jack, in a rare moment of self-reflection, tells her that he doesn't have a good reason to lie, but does it anyway, and out of all the lies he's ever told, that one was the only one to cause him guilt. He remarks that sometimes tell a lie so big that it eats away a part of them, and that, if given a second chance, most people would do anything to set that lie straight. Novalee realizes that the lie she has told that has changed her life is telling Forney that she didn't love him. Once Willy Jack is released, Novalee makes plans to take him back home to Tennessee, but first, she finally calls Forney and tearfully confesses to him that she lied about loving him and that she thought he deserved someone better. Forney assures her that there is nothing better than she is. Willy Jack is loaded up into Novalee's car as she prepares to take him home, but she decides to wait out a sudden storm before heading underway. While she waits out the rain, she reflects on her life and the connections she'd made since being abandoned at the Walmart, and the home and happiness she'd created in the seven years since.

In the Middle Ages it was sometimes called Little Barford or North Barford to distinguish it from the larger village of Barford St. Michael on the opposite bank of the Swere. Chapel The Church of England chapel of St. John was built in about 1150, but only the south doorway and the font survive from this period. The chancel was rebuilt in the 13th century, and the Decorated Gothic windows in the nave were added in the 14th century. There was a tower at the southwest corner of the church, with the date 1622 on a stone near the top. In 1860–61 the Gothic Revival architect G.E. Street rebuilt the church, demolishing the tower and replacing it with a new one over the south porch. St. John's was built as a dependent chapelry of the parish church of Barford St. Michael, and it remains part of the same ecclesiastical parish. The parish of St. John and St. Michael and that of Deddington and Hempton are now run as a single benefice. RAF station RAF Barford St John was established just north of the village in 1941.

It attenuates airbone sound waves, reducing their amplitude, for the purposes of noise reduction or noise control. The energy is dissipated as heat. Acoustic foam can be made in several different colors, sizes and thickness. Acoustic foam can be attached to walls, ceilings, doors, and other features of a room to control noise levels, vibration, and echoes. Many acoustic foam products are treated with dyes and/or fire retardants.  Uses  The objective of acoustic foam is to improve the sound quality by removing residual sound in any space. This purpose requires strategic placement of acoustic foam panels on walls, ceiling and floors, effectively eliminating resonance within the room. = Acoustic enhancement = The objective is to enhance the properties of sound by improving speech clarity and sound quality. For this reason, acoustic foam is often used in recording studios. The purpose is to reduce, but not entirely eliminate, resonance within the room. This is achieved by placing similar sized pieces of foam, often in the shape of cones or triangles, on opposite walls.} Sound waves reflect off of surfaces and continue to bounce around in the room. When a wave encounters a change in acoustic impedance, such as hitting a solid surface, acoustic reflections transpire. These reflections will occur many times before the wave becomes inaudible. Reflections can cause acoustic problems such as phase summation and phase cancellation. A new complex wave happens when the direct source wave coincides with the reflected waves. This complex wave will change the frequency response of the source material. = Functionality = Acoustic foam is a lightweight material made from polyurethane foam either polyether or polyester, and also extruded melamine foam. It is usually cut into tiles - often with pyramid or wedge shapes - which are suited to placing on the walls of a recording studio or a similar type of environment to act as a sound absorber, thus enhancing the sound quality within a room. Acoustic foam reduces or eliminates echoes and background noises by controlling the reverberation that sound can make by bouncing off walls. This type of sound absorption is different from soundproofing, which is typically used to keep sound from escaping or entering a room. Therefore, acoustic foam is installed in large rooms like churches, synagogues, concert halls. These rooms have large, flat space and noise will certainly bounce around in the room. These sound absorbers are used to improve the acoustics of the room, which thereby reduces noise in the room. Acoustic foam typically deals more with the mid and high frequencies. To deal with lower frequencies, much thicker pieces of acoustic foam are needed; large pieces of acoustic foam are often placed in the corners of a room and are called acoustic foam corner bass traps.

Corruption may include many activities including bribery and embezzlement, though it may also involve practices that are legal in many countries. Political corruption occurs when an office-holder or other governmental employee acts in an official capacity for personal gain. Corruption is most commonplace in kleptocracies, oligarchies, narco-states and mafia states. Corruption can occur on different scales, corruption ranges from small favors between a small number of people (petty corruption), to corruption that affects the government on a large scale (grand corruption), and corruption that is so prevalent that it is part of the everyday structure of society, including corruption as one of the symptoms of organized crime. Corruption and crime are endemic sociological occurrences which appear with regular frequency in virtually all countries on a global scale in varying degree and proportion. Individual nations each allocate domestic resources for the control and regulation of corruption and crime. Strategies to counter corruption are often summarized under the umbrella term anti-corruption. Additionally, global initiative like the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 16 also has a target to substantially reduce corruption of all forms. Definitions and scales A billboard in Zambia exhorting the public to \\"Just say no to corruption\\". Stephen D. Morris,Morris, S.D. (1991), Corruption and Politics in Contemporary Mexico. University of Alabama Press, Tuscaloosa a professor of politics, wrote that political corruption is the illegitimate use of public power to benefit a private interest. Economist Ian Senior defined corruption as an action to (a) secretly provide (b) a good or a service to a third party (c) so that he or she can influence certain actions which (d) benefit the corrupt, a third party, or both (e) in which the corrupt agent has authority.Senior, I. (2006), Corruption – The World’s Big C., Institute of Economic Affairs, London World Bank economist Daniel Kaufmann, extended the concept to include \\"legal corruption\\" in which power is abused within the confines of the law—as those with power often have the ability to make laws for their protection. The effect of corruption in infrastructure is to increase costs and construction time, lower the quality and decrease the benefit. Corruption can occur on different scales. Corruption ranges from small favors between a small number of people (petty corruption), to corruption that affects the government on a large scale (grand corruption), and corruption that is so prevalent that it is part of the everyday structure of society, including corruption as one of the symptoms of organized crime. A number of indicators and tools have been developed which can measure different forms of corruption with increasing accuracy. = Petty corruption = Petty corruption occurs at a smaller scale and takes place at the implementation end of public services when public officials meet the public. For example, in many small places such as registration offices, police stations, state licensing boards, and many other private and government sectors. =Grand corruption= Grand corruption is defined as corruption occurring at the highest levels of government in a way that requires significant subversion of the political, legal and economic systems. Such corruption is commonly found in countries with authoritarian or dictatorial governments but also in those without adequate policing of corruption. The government system in many countries is divided into the legislative, executive and judicial branches in an attempt to provide independent services that are less subject to grand corruption due to their independence from one another. =Systemic corruption= Systemic corruption (or endemic corruption) is corruption which is primarily due to the weaknesses of an organization or process. It can be contrasted with individual officials or agents who act corruptly within the system. Factors which encourage systemic corruption include conflicting incentives, discretionary powers; monopolistic powers; lack of transparency; low pay; and a culture of impunity. Specific acts of corruption include \\"bribery, extortion, and embezzlement\\" in a system where \\"corruption becomes the rule rather than the exception.\\" Scholars distinguish between centralized and decentralized systemic corruption, depending on which level of state or government corruption takes place; in countries such as the Post-Soviet states both types occur. Some scholars argue that there is a negative duty of western governments to protect against systematic corruption of underdeveloped governments. Corruption has been a major issue in China, where society depends heavily on personal relationships. By the late 20th century that combined with the new lust for wealth, produced escalating corruption. Historian Keith Schoppa says that bribery was only one of the tools of Chinese corruption, which also included, \\"embezzlement, nepotism, smuggling, extortion, cronyism, kickbacks, deception, fraud, squandering public monies, illegal business transactions, stock manipulation and real estate fraud.\\" Given the repeated anti-corruption campaigns it was a prudent precaution to move as much of the fraudulent money as possible overseas.R. Keith Schoppa, Revolution and Its Past: Identities and Change in Modern Chinese History (3rd ed. 2020) p . 383.  Causes  Per R. KlitgaardKlitgaard, Robert (1998), Controlling Corruption, University of California Press, Berkeley, CA corruption will occur if the corrupt gain is greater than the penalty multiplied by the likelihood of being caught and prosecuted: Corrupt gain > Penalty × Likelihood of being caught and prosecuted Klitgaard has also coined a metaphorical formula to illustrate how the amount of corruption depends on three variables: monopoly (M) on the supply of a good or service, the discretion (D) enjoyed by suppliers, and the supplier's accountability and transparency (A) to others. The amount of corruption (C) could be expressed as: C = M + D – A. Since a high degree of monopoly and discretion accompanied by a low degree of transparency does not automatically lead to corruption, a fourth variable of \\"morality\\" or \\"integrity\\" has been introduced by others. The moral dimension has an intrinsic component and refers to a \\"mentality problem\\", and an extrinsic component referring to circumstances like poverty, inadequate remuneration, inappropriate work conditions and inoperable or over-complicated procedures which demoralize people and let them search for \\"alternative\\" solutions.Stephan, Constantin (2012), Industrial Health, Safety and Environmental Management, MV Wissenschaft, Muenster, 3rd edition 2012, pp. 26–28, Hence the amended Klitgaard equation is Degree of corruption = Monopoly + Discretion – Transparency – Morality According to a 2017 survey study, the following factors have been attributed as causes of corruption: It has been noted that in a comparison of the most corrupt with the least corrupt countries, the former group contains nations with huge socio-economic inequalities, and the latter contains nations with a high degree of social and economic justice.The root cause of corruption Tabish Khair In different sectors Corruption can occur in many sectors, whether they be public or private industry or even NGOs (especially in public sector). However, only in democratically controlled institutions is there an interest of the public (owner) to develop internal mechanisms to fight active or passive corruption, whereas in private industry as well as in NGOs there is no public control. Therefore, the owners' investors' or sponsors' profits are largely decisive. =Government/public sector= Public corruption includes corruption of the political process and of government agencies such as the police as well as corruption in processes of allocating public funds for contracts, grants, and hiring. Recent research by the World Bank suggests that who makes policy decisions (elected officials or bureaucrats) can be critical in determining the level of corruption because of the incentives different policy-makers face. Within the political system A political cartoon from Harper's Weekly, 26 January 1878, depicting U.S. Secretary of the Interior Carl Schurz investigating the Indian Bureau at the U.S. Department of the Interior. The original caption for the cartoon is: \\"THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR INVESTIGATING THE INDIAN BUREAU. GIVE HIM HIS DUE, AND GIVE THEM THEIR DUES.\\" Political corruption is the abuse of public power, office, or resources by elected government officials for personal gain, by extortion, soliciting or offering bribes. It can also take the form of office holders maintaining themselves in office by purchasing votes by enacting laws which use taxpayers' money. Evidence suggests that corruption can have political consequences- with citizens being asked for bribes becoming less likely to identify with their country or region. The political act of graft (American English), is a well known and now global form of political corruption, being the unscrupulous and illegal use of a politician's authority for personal gain, when funds intended for public projects are intentionally misdirected in order to maximize the benefits to illegally private interests of the corrupted individual(s) and their cronies. In some cases government institutions are \\"repurposed\\" or shifted away from their official mandate to serve other, often corrupt purposes.Chipkin, Ivor and Swilling, Mark, 2018, Shadow State: the Politics of State Capture, Johannesburg: Wits University Press See too State Capture. The Kaunas \\"Golden Toilet\\". The Kaunas golden toilet case was a major Lithuanian scandal. In 2009, the municipality of Kaunas (led by mayor Andrius Kupčinskas) ordered that a shipping container was to be converted into an outdoor toilet at a cost of 500,000 litai (around 150,000 euros). It was to also require 5,000 litai (1,500 euros) in monthly maintenance costs. At the same time when Kaunas's \\"Golden Toilet\\" was built, Kėdainiai tennis club acquired a very similar, but more advanced solution for 4,500 euros. Because of the inflated cost of the outdoor toilet, it was nicknamed the \\"Golden Toilet\\". Despite the investment, the \\"Golden Toilet\\" remained closed for years due to the dysfunctionality and was a subject of a lengthy anti-corruption investigation into those who had created it and the local municipality even considered demolishing the building at one point. The group of public servants involved in the toilet's procurement received various prison sentences for recklessness, malfeasance, misuse of power and document falsifications in a 2012 court case, but were cleared of their corruption charges and received compensation, which pushed the total construction cost and subsequent related financial losses to 352,000 euros. Various sources acclaim the Spanish People's Party – Partido Popular -, to be Europe's most corrupt party, with about yearly 45 billion euro worth of corruption. On 7 July 2020, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a global think tank, released a report claiming the Emirati city, Dubai, of being an enabler of global corruption, crime and illicit financial flows. It stated that the global corrupt and criminal actors either operated through or from Dubai. The city was also called a haven for trade-based money laundering, has it gives space to free trade zones, with minimal regulatory laws and customs enforcement. Within the police Police corruption is a specific form of police misconduct designed to obtain financial benefits, personal gain, career advancement for a police officer or officers in exchange for not pursuing or selectively pursuing an investigation or arrest or aspects of the \\"thin blue line\\" itself where force members collude in lies to protect other members from accountability. One common form of police corruption is soliciting or accepting bribes in exchange for not reporting organized drug or prostitution rings or other illegal activities. Another example is police officers flouting the police code of conduct in order to secure convictions of suspects—for example, through the use of surveillance abuse, forced confessions and/or falsified evidence. More rarely, police officers may deliberately and systematically participate in organized crime themselves. In most major cities, there are internal affairs sections to investigate suspected police corruption or misconduct. Similar entities include the British Independent Police Complaints Commission. In the judicial system The Good and the Bad Judge (Monsaraz, Portugal), the Bad Judge, depicted as having two faces, is shown taking bribes: the nobleman to the right offers him gold coins from a purse, and the villein to the left gives him a pair of partridges. Judicial corruption refers to corruption-related misconduct of judges, through receiving or giving bribes, improper sentencing of convicted criminals, bias in the hearing and judgement of arguments and other such misconduct. Judicial corruption can also be conducted by prosecutors and defense attorneys. An example of prosecutorial misconduct, would be a politician or a crime boss bribing a prosecutor to open investigations and file charges against an opposing politician or a rival crime boss, in order to hurt the competition.https://www.drugwarfacts.org/chapter/corruption An example of attorney misconduct, would be a defense attorney refusing to represent a client for political or professional motives.https://definitions.uslegal.com/a/attorney-misconduct/ Governmental corruption of judiciary is broadly known in many transitional and developing countries because the budget is almost completely controlled by the executive. The latter undermines the separation of powers, as it creates a critical financial dependence of the judiciary. The proper national wealth distribution including the government spending on the judiciary is subject to the constitutional economics. It is important to distinguish between the two methods of corruption of the judiciary: the government (through budget planning and various privileges), and the private. Judicial corruption can be difficult to completely eradicate, even in developed countries. Corruption in judiciary also involves the government in power using the judicial arm of government to oppress the opposition parties in the detriments of the state. Within the military Military corruption refers to the abuse of power by members in the armed forces, in order for career advancement or for personal gain by a soldier or soldiers. One form of military corruption in the United States Armed Forces, is a military soldier being promoted in rank or being given better treatment then their colleagues by their officers, due to their race, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender, religious beliefs, social class or personal relationships with higher ranking officers in spite of their merit.https://www.dosomething.org/us/facts/11-facts-about-military- discrimination In addition to that, the US military has also had many instances of officers sexually assaulting fellow officers and in many cases, there were allegations that many of the attacks were covered up and victims were coerced to remain silent by officers of the same rank or of higher rank.http://www.ncpolicywatch.com/2020/07/29/metoo-movement-exposes-failure- of-u-s-military-to-take-seriously-sexual-assault/ Another example of military corruption, is a military officer or officers using the power of their positions to commit activities that are illegal, such as skimming logistical supplies such as food, medicine, fuel, body armor or weapons to sell on the local black market.https://publicintegrity.org/national-security/u-s-military- personnel-have-been-convicted-of-50-million-worth-of-crimes-in-iraq-and- afghanistan/https://www.thebalancecareers.com/gang-activity-in-the-u-s- military-3354199 There have also been instances of military officials, providing equipment and combat support to criminal syndicates, private military companies and terrorist groups, without approval from their superiors.https://fas.org/irp/threat/pub45270chap3.html As a result, many countries have a military police force to ensure that the military officers follow the laws and conduct of their respective countries but sometimes the military police have levels of corruption themselves.https://www.unodc.org/documents/treaties/publications/core_factors.pdf =In healthcare= Corruption, the abuse of entrusted power for private gain, as defined by Transparency International is systemic in the health sector. The characteristics of health systems with their concentrated supply of a service, high discretionary power of its members controlling the supply, and low accountability to others are the exact constellation of the variables described by Klitgaard, on which corruption depends. Corruption in health care is more dangerous than in any other sector, because it affects health outcomes and is literally deadly. It is widespread and yet, little has been published in medical journals about this topic and as of 2019 there is no evidence on what might reduce corruption in the health sector. Corruption occurs within the private and public health sectors and may appear as theft, embezzlement, nepotism, bribery up til extortion, or as undue influence. and occurs anywhere within the sector, be it in service provision, purchasing, construction and hiring. In 2019, Transparency International has described the 6 most common ways of service corruption as follows: absenteeism, informal payments from patients, embezzlement, inflating services and the costs of services, favouritism and manipulation of data (billing for goods and services that were never sent or done). =Corporate corruption= Petrobras headquarters in downtown Rio de Janeiro. In criminology, corporate crime refers to crimes committed either by a corporation (i.e., a business entity having a separate legal personality from the natural persons that manage its activities), or by individuals acting on behalf of a corporation or other business entity (see vicarious liability and corporate liability). Some negative behaviours by corporations may not be criminal; laws vary between jurisdictions. For example, some jurisdictions allow insider trading. Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. — Petrobras, more commonly known as simply Petrobras (), is a semi-public Brazilian multinational corporation in the petroleum industry headquartered in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The company's name translates to Brazilian Petroleum Corporation – Petrobras. The company was ranked No. 58 in the 2016 Fortune Global 500 list. It is being investigated over corporate and political collusion and corruption. Odebrecht is a privately held Brazilian conglomerate consisting of businesses in the fields of engineering, real estate, construction, chemicals and petrochemicals. The company was founded in 1944 in Salvador da Bahia by Norberto Odebrecht, and the firm is now present in South America, Central America, North America, the Caribbean, Africa, Europe and the Middle East. Its leading company is . Odebrecht is one of the 25 largest international construction companies and led by Odebrecht family. In 2016, the firm's executives were examined during Operation Car Wash part of an investigation over Odebrecht Organization bribes to executives of Petrobras, in exchange for contracts and influence. Operation Car Wash is an ongoing criminal money laundering and bribes related corporate crime investigation being carried out by the Federal Police of Brazil, Curitiba Branch, and judicially commanded by Judge Sérgio Moro since 17 March 2014.Economia UOL.

In many societies and international organizations, education corruption remains a taboo. In some countries, such as certain eastern European countries, some Balkan countries and certain Asian countries, corruption occurs frequently in universities.Heyneman, S. P., Anderson, K. H. and Nuraliyeva, N. (2008). The cost of corruption in higher education. Comparative Education Review, 51, 1–25. This can include bribes to bypass bureaucratic procedures and bribing faculty for a grade.Graeff, P., Sattler, S., Mehlkop, G. and Sauer, C.

For decades, the Teamsters had been substantially controlled by La Cosa Nostra. Since 1957, four of eight Teamster presidents were indicted, yet the union continued to be controlled by organized crime elements. The federal government has been successful at removing the criminal influence from this 1.4 million-member union by using the civil process. =In religion= The history of religion includes numerous examples of religious leaders calling attention to corruption in the religious practices and institutions of their time. Jewish prophets Isaiah and Amos berate the rabbinical establishment of Ancient Judea for failing to live up to the ideals of the Torah.Isaiah 1:2–31, Amos 5:21–24. In the New Testament, Jesus accuses the rabbinical establishment of his time of hypocritically following only the ceremonial parts of the Torah and neglecting the more important elements of justice, mercy and faithfulness.Mt 23:13–33. Corruption was one of the important issues during the Investiture Controversy. In 1517, Martin Luther accuses the Catholic Church of widespread corruption, including selling of indulgences.See Ninety-five Theses. In 2015, Princeton University professor Kevin M. Kruse advances the thesis that business leaders in the 1930s and 1940s collaborated with clergymen, including James W. Fifield Jr., to develop and promote a new hermeneutical approach to Scripture that would de-emphasize the social Gospel and emphasize themes, such as individual salvation, more congenial to free enterprise.Kevin M. Kruse, One Nation Under God: How Corporate America Invented Christian America (2015), p. 7. ::Business leaders, of course, had long been working to \\"merchandise\\" themselves through the appropriation of religion. In organizations such as Spiritual Mobilization, the prayer breakfast groups, and the Freedoms Foundation, they had linked capitalism and Christianity and, at the same time, likened the welfare state to godless paganism.Kevin M. Kruse, One Nation Under God: How Corporate America Invented Christian America (2015), p. 86. =In philosophy= 19th-century German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer acknowledged that academics, including philosophers, are subject to the same sources of corruption as the society they inhabit. He distinguished the corrupt \\"university\\" philosophers, whose \\"real concern is to earn with credit an honest livelihood for themselves and ... to enjoy a certain prestige in the eyes of the public\\"Arthur Schopenhauer, \\"On Philosophy in the Universities\\", Parerga and Paralipomena, E. Payne, trans. (1974) Vol. 1, p. 141. from the genuine philosopher, whose sole motive is to discover and bear witness to the truth. ::To be a philosopher, that is to say, a lover of wisdom (for wisdom is nothing but truth), it is not enough for a man to love truth, in so far as it is compatible with his own interest, with the will of his superiors, with the dogmas of the church, or with the prejudices and tastes of his contemporaries; so long as he rests content with this position, he is only a φίλαυτος [lover of self], not a φιλόσοφος [lover of wisdom]. For this title of honor is well and wisely conceived precisely by its stating that one should love the truth earnestly and with one’s whole heart, and thus unconditionally and unreservedly, above all else, and, if need be, in defiance of all else. Now the reason for this is the one previously stated that the intellect has become free, and in this state, it does not even know or understand any other interest than that of truth.Arthur Schopenhauer, \\"Sketch for a history of the doctrine of the ideal and the real\\", Parerga and Paralipomena, E. Payne, trans. (1974) Vol. 1, pp. 21–22. =Arms for cash= \\"Arms for cash\\" can be done by either a state-sanctioned arms dealer, firm or state itself to another party it just regards as only a good business partner and not political kindred or allies, thus making them no better than regular gun runners. Arms smugglers, who are already into arms trafficking may work for them on the ground or with shipment. The money is often laundered and records are often destroyed. It often breaks UN, national or international law. Payment can also be in strange or indirect ways like arms paid for in post-war oil contracts, post-war hotel ownership, conflict diamonds, corporate shares or the long term post-war promises of superfus future contracts between the parties involved in it, etc... In 2006 Transparency International ranked Angola a lowly 142 out of 163 countries in the Corruption Perception Index just after Venezuela and before the Republic of the Congo with a 2.2 rating. Angola was at 168th place (out of 178 countries) on Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), receiving a 1.9 on a scale from 0 to 10. On the World Bank's 2009 Worldwide Governance Index, Angola had done very poorly on all six aspects of governance assessed. While its score for political stability improved to 35.8 in 2009 (on a 100-point scale) from 19.2 in 2004, Angola earned especially low scores for accountability, regulatory standards, and rule of law. The score for corruption declined from an extremely low 6.3 in 2004 to 5.2 in 2009. The country is regarded poorly and that corruption is wounding the economy badly despite the emerging oil industries wealth. The Mitterrand–Pasqua affair, also known informally as Angolagate, was an international political scandal over the secret and illegal sale and shipment of arms from the nations of Central Europe to the government of Angola by the Government of France in the 1990s. It led to arrests and judiciary actions in the 2000s, involved an illegal arms sale to Angola despite a UN embargo, with business interests in France and elsewhere improperly obtaining a share of Angolan oil revenues. The scandal has subsequently been tied to several prominent figures in French politics. 42 individuals, including: 42 people, including Jean-Christophe Mitterrand, Jacques Attali, Charles Pasqua and Jean-Charles Marchiani, Pierre Falcone. Arcadi Gaydamak, Paul-Loup Sulitzer, Union for a Popular Movement deputy Georges Fenech, the son of François Mitterrand and a former French Minister of the Interior, were charged, accused, indicted or convicted with illegal arms trading, tax fraud, embezzlement, money laundering and other crimes. \\" Methods In systemic corruption and grand corruption, multiple methods of corruption are used concurrently with similar aims. =Bribery= An election leaflet with money stapled to it. Bribery involves the improper use of gifts and favours in exchange for personal gain. This is also known as kickbacks or, in the Middle East, as baksheesh. It is a common form of corruption. The types of favors given are diverse and may include money, gifts, promotions, sexual favors, company shares, entertainment, employment and political benefits. The personal gain that is given can be anything from actively giving preferential treatment to having an indiscretion or crime overlooked. Bribery can sometimes form a part of the systemic use of corruption for other ends, for example to perpetrate further corruption. Bribery can make officials more susceptible to blackmail or to extortion. =Embezzlement, theft and fraud= Embezzlement and theft involve someone with access to funds or assets illegally taking control of them. Fraud involves using deception to convince the owner of funds or assets to give them up to an unauthorized party. Examples include the misdirection of company funds into \\"shadow companies\\" (and then into the pockets of corrupt employees), the skimming of foreign aid money, scams, electoral fraud and other corrupt activity. =Graft= The political act of graft is when funds intended for public projects are intentionally misdirected to maximize the benefits to private interests of the corrupt individuals. =Extortion and blackmail= While bribery is the use of positive inducements for corrupt aims, extortion and blackmail centre around the use of threats. This can be the threat of physical violence or false imprisonment as well as exposure of an individual's secrets or prior crimes. This includes such behavior as an influential person threatening to go to the media if they do not receive speedy medical treatment (at the expense of other patients), threatening a public official with exposure of their secrets if they do not vote in a particular manner, or demanding money in exchange for continued secrecy. Another example can be a police officer being threatened with the loss of their job by their superiors, if they continued with investigating a high-ranking official. =Influence peddling= Influence peddling is the illegal practice of using one's influence in government or connections with persons in authority to obtain favors or preferential treatment, usually in return for payment. =Networking= Networking (both Business and Personal) can be an effective way for job-seekers to gain a competitive edge over others in the job-market. The idea is to cultivate personal relationships with prospective employers, selection panelists, and others, in the hope that these personal affections will influence future hiring decisions. This form of networking has been described as an attempt to corrupt formal hiring processes, where all candidates are given an equal opportunity to demonstrate their merits to selectors. The networker is accused of seeking non- meritocratic advantage over other candidates; advantage that is based on personal fondness rather than on any objective appraisal of which candidate is most qualified for the position. Euro bank notes hidden in sleeve. =Abuse of discretion= Abuse of discretion refers to the misuse of one's powers and decision-making facilities. Examples include a judge improperly dismissing a criminal case or a customs official using their discretion to allow a banned substance through a port. =Favoritism, nepotism and clientelism= Favouritism, nepotism and clientelism involve the favouring of not the perpetrator of corruption but someone related to them, such as a friend, family member or member of an association. Examples would include hiring or promoting a family member or staff member to a role they are not qualified for, who belongs to the same political party as you, regardless of merit. Some states do not forbid these forms of corruption.  Relationship to economic growth  Corruption is strongly negatively associated with the share of private investment and, hence, it lowers the rate of economic growth.Mo, P.H. (2001). Corruption and Economic Growth. Journal of Comparative Economics, 29, 66–79. Corruption reduces the returns of productive activities. If the returns to production fall faster than the returns to corruption and rent-seeking activities, resources will flow from productive activities to corruption activities over time. This will result in a lower stock of producible inputs like human capital in corrupted countries. Corruption creates the opportunity for increased inequality, reduces the return of productive activities, and, hence, makes rentseeking and corruption activities more attractive. This opportunity for increased inequality not only generates psychological frustration to the underprivileged but also reduces productivity growth, investment, and job opportunities.  Prevention According to the amended Klitgaard equation, limitation of monopoly and regulator discretion of individuals and a high degree of transparency through independent oversight by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and the media plus public access to reliable information could reduce the problem. Djankov and other researchers have independently addressed the role information plays in fighting corruption with evidence from both developing and developed countries. Disclosing financial information of government officials to the public is associated with improving institutional accountability and eliminating misbehavior such as vote buying. The effect is specifically remarkable when the disclosures concern politicians' income sources, liabilities and asset level instead of just income level. Any extrinsic aspects that might reduce morality should be eliminated. Additionally, a country should establish a culture of ethical conduct in society with the government setting the good example in order to enhance the intrinsic morality. In 1969, Christian anarchist Dorothy Day argued that God will resolve economic abuses such as corruption. She wrote,\\"Hutterite Communities,\\" Catholic Worker (July–August 1969) =Enhancing civil society participation = Creating bottom-up mechanisms, promoting citizens participation and encouraging the values of integrity, accountability, and transparency are crucial components of fighting corruption. As of 2012, the implementation of the \\"Advocacy and Legal Advice Centres (ALACs)” in Europe had led to a significant increase in the number of citizen complaints against acts of corruption received and documented and also to the development of strategies for good governance by involving citizens willing to fight against corruption. Anti-corruption programmes United Nations Convention against Corruption The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA, USA 1977) was an early paradigmatic law for many western countries i.e. industrial countries of the OECD. There, for the first time the old principal- agent approach was moved back where mainly the victim (a society, private or public) and a passive corrupt member (an individual) were considered, whereas the active corrupt part was not in the focus of legal prosecution. Unprecedented, the law of an industrial country directly condemned active corruption, particularly in international business transactions, which was at that time in contradiction to anti-bribery activities of the World Bank and its spin-off organization Transparency International. As early as 1989 the OECD had established an ad hoc Working Group in order to explore \\"...the concepts fundamental to the offense of corruption, and the exercise of national jurisdiction over offenses committed wholly or partially abroad.\\" Based on the FCPA concept, the Working Group presented in 1994 the then \\"OECD Anti-Bribery Recommendation\\" as precursor for the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions which was signed in 1997 by all member countries and came finally into force in 1999. However, because of ongoing concealed corruption in international transactions several instruments of Country Monitoring have been developed since then by the OECD in order to foster and evaluate related national activities in combating foreign corrupt practices. One survey shows that after the implementation of heightened review of multinational firms under the convention in 2010 firms from countries that had signed the convention were less likely to use bribery. In 2013, a document produced by the economic and private sector professional evidence and applied knowledge services help-desk discusses some of the existing practices on anti-corruption. They found: * The theories behind the fight against corruption are moving from a Principal agent approach to a collective action problem. Principal-agent theories seem not to be suitable to target systemic corruption. * The role of multilateral institutions has been crucial in the fight against corruption. UNCAC provides a common guideline for countries around the world. Both Transparency International and the World Bank provide assistance to national governments in term of diagnostic and design of anti-corruption policies. * The use of anti- corruption agencies have proliferated in recent years after the signing of UNCAC. They found no convincing evidence on the extent of their contribution, or the best way to structure them. * Traditionally anti-corruption policies have been based on success experiences and common sense. In recent years there has been an effort to provide a more systematic evaluation of the effectiveness of anti-corruption policies. They found that this literature is still in its infancy. * Anti-corruption policies that may be in general recommended to developing countries may not be suitable for post-conflict countries. Anti-corruption policies in fragile states have to be carefully tailored. * Anti-corruption policies can improve the business environment. There is evidence that lower corruption may facilitate doing business and improve firm's productivity. Rwanda in the last decade has made tremendous progress in improving governance and the business environment providing a model to follow for post-conflict countries.  In popular culture  In some countries people travel to corruption hot spots or a specialist tour company takes them on corruption city tours, as it is the case in Prague. Corruption tours have also occurred in Chicago, and Mexico City Films about corruption include Runaway Jury, The Firm, Syriana, The Constant Gardener, and All the President's Men. Legal corruption Though corruption is often viewed as illegal, a concept of legal corruption has been described by Daniel Kaufmann and Pedro Vicente. It might be termed as processes which are corrupt, but are protected by a legal (that is, specifically permitted, or at least not proscribed by law) framework. = Examples= In 1994, the German Parliamentary Financial Commission in Bonn presented a comparative study on \\"legal corruption\\" in industrialized OECD countries They reported that in most industrial countries foreign corruption was legal, and that their foreign corrupt practices ranged from simple , through governmental subsidization (tax deduction), up to extreme cases as in Germany, where foreign corruption was fostered, whereas domestic was legally prosecuted. The German Parliamentary Financial Commission rejected a Parliamentary Proposal by the opposition, which had been aiming to limit German foreign corruption on the basis of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA from 1977), thus fostering national export corporations.Drucksache 12/8468: \\"Die Ablehnung erfolgte mit den Stimmen der Koalitionsfraktionen gegen die Stimmen der Fraktion der SPD bei Abwesenheit der Gruppen BÜNDNIS 90/DIE GRÜNEN und der PDS/Linke Liste.\\" In 1997 a corresponding OECD Anti-Bribery Convention was signed by its members. It took until 1999, after the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention came into force, that Germany withdrew the legalization of foreign corruption.§ 4 chapter 5 no. 10 Income Tax Act, valid until 19 March 1999 Foreign corrupt practices of industrialized OECD countries 1994 study The Foreign corrupt practices of industrialized OECD countries 1994 (Parliamentary Financial Commission study, Bonn). Belgium: bribe payments are generally tax deductible as business expenses if the name and address of the beneficiary is disclosed. Under the following conditions kickbacks in connection with exports abroad are permitted for deduction even without proof of the receiver: * Payments must be necessary in order to be able to survive against foreign competition * They must be common in the industry * A corresponding application must be made to the Treasury each year * Payments must be appropriate * The payer has to pay a lump-sum to the tax office to be fixed by the Finance Minister (at least 20% of the amount paid). In the absence of the required conditions, for corporate taxable companies paying bribes without proof of the receiver, a special tax of 200% is charged. This special tax may, however, be abated along with the bribe amount as an operating expense. Denmark: bribe payments are deductible when a clear operational context exists and its adequacy is maintained. France: basically all operating expenses can be deducted. However, staff costs must correspond to an actual work done and must not be excessive compared to the operational significance. This also applies to payments to foreign parties. Here, the receiver shall specify the name and address, unless the total amount in payments per beneficiary does not exceed 500 FF. If the receiver is not disclosed the payments are considered \\"rémunérations occult\\" and are associated with the following disadvantages: * The business expense deduction (of the bribe money) is eliminated. * For corporations and other legal entities, a tax penalty of 100% of the \\"rémunérations occult\\" and 75% for voluntary post declaration is to be paid. * There may be a general fine of up 200 FF fixed per case. Japan: in Japan, bribes are deductible as business expenses that are justified by the operation (of the company) if the name and address of the recipient is specified. This also applies to payments to foreigners. If the indication of the name is refused, the expenses claimed are not recognized as operating expenses. Canada: there is no general rule on the deductibility or non-deductibility of kickbacks and bribes. Hence the rule is that necessary expenses for obtaining the income (contract) are deductible. Payments to members of the public service and domestic administration of justice, to officers and employees and those charged with the collection of fees, entrance fees etc. for the purpose to entice the recipient to the violation of his official duties, can not be abated as business expenses as well as illegal payments according to the Criminal Code. Luxembourg: bribes, justified by the operation (of a company) are deductible as business expenses. However, the tax authorities may require that the payer is to designate the receiver by name. If not, the expenses are not recognized as operating expenses. Netherlands: all expenses that are directly or closely related to the business are deductible. This also applies to expenditure outside the actual business operations if they are considered beneficial as to the operation for good reasons by the management. What counts is the good merchant custom. Neither the law nor the administration is authorized to determine which expenses are not operationally justified and therefore not deductible. For the business expense deduction it is not a requirement that the recipient is specified. It is sufficient to elucidate to the satisfaction of the tax authorities that the payments are in the interest of the operation. Austria: bribes justified by the operation (of a company) are deductible as business expenses. However, the tax authority may require that the payer names the recipient of the deducted payments exactly. If the indication of the name is denied e.g. because of business comity, the expenses claimed are not recognized as operating expenses. This principle also applies to payments to foreigners. Switzerland: bribe payments are tax deductible if it is clearly operation initiated and the consignee is indicated. US: (rough résumé: \\"generally operational expenses are deductible if they are not illegal according to the FCPA\\") UK: kickbacks and bribes are deductible if they have been paid for operating purposes. The tax authority may request the name and address of the recipient.\\" \\"Specific\\" legal corruption: exclusively against foreign countries Referring to the recommendation of the above- mentioned Parliamentary Financial Commission's study, the then Kohl administration (1991–1994) decided to maintain the legality of corruption against officials exclusively in foreign transactionsthe term \\"official\\" had been limited to German jurisdiction. Officials of other states legally were no \\"officials\\". See für Rolf Keller\\" Essay in Memory for Rolf Keller, 2003, Edited by Criminal Law professors from the Law Faculty of Tübingen and the Ministry of Justice of Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany, page 104: \\"Nach der Legaldefinition des §11 I Nr.2a StGB versteht man unter einem Amtsträger u. a. eine Person, die >>nach deutschem Recht Beamter oder Richter ist. Die Vorschrift enthält also eine vom Wortlaut her eindeutige Einschränkung auf das deutsche Recht. Ausländische Amtsträger werden somit nicht erfasst.\\" and confirmed the full deductibility of bribe money, co-financing thus a specific nationalistic corruption practice (§4 Abs. 5 Nr. 10 EStG, valid until 19 March 1999) in contradiction to the 1994 OECD recommendation. The respective law was not changed before the OECD Convention also in Germany came into force (1999).Britta Bannenberg, Korruption in Deutschland und ihre strafrechtliche Kontrolle, page VII (Introduction): \\"Durch die OECD-Konvention und europaweite Abkommen wurden auch in Deutschland neue Anti-Korruptions-Gesetze geschaffen, so dass nun die Auslandsbestechung durch deutsche Unternehmen dem Strafrecht unterfällt und die Bestechungsgelder nicht mehr als Betriebsausgaben von der Steuer abgesetzt werden können.\\" According to the Parliamentary Financial Commission's study, however, in 1994 most countries' corruption practices were not nationalistic and much more limited by the respective laws compared to Germany.Parliamentary Financial Commission's study 1994, pp. 6–7: \\"Nach Auffassung der Fraktion der SPD belegt auch der Bericht der Bundesregierung eindeutig, daß in den meisten ausländischen Industriestaaten Schmier- und Bestechungsgelder in wesentlich geringerem Umfang als in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland steuerlich abgesetzt werden könnten. So müsse in fast allen Staaten bei Zahlungen in das Ausland der Empfänger angegeben werden... Die Abzugsfähigkeit der genannten Ausgaben (Schmier- und Bestechungsgelder) stelle eine steuerliche Subvention dar...\\" (West-) Germany 1975–2015. Original shadow economy data from Friedrich Schneider, University Linz. Particularly, the non-disclosure of the bribe money recipients' name in tax declarations had been a powerful instrument for Legal Corruption during the 1990s for German corporations, enabling them to block foreign legal jurisdictions which intended to fight corruption in their countries. Hence, they uncontrolled established a strong network of clientelism around Europe (e.g. SIEMENS) along with the formation of the European Single Market in the upcoming European Union and the Eurozone. Moreover, in order to further strengthen active corruption the prosecution of tax evasion during that decade had been severely limited. German tax authorities were instructed to refuse any disclosure of bribe recipients' names from tax declarations to the German criminal prosecution.Transparency International: \\"Geschützt durch das Steuergeheimnis dürfen die Steuerbehörden Hinweise auf Korruption nicht an die Staatsanwaltschaft melden.\\" As a result, German corporations have been systematically increasing their informal economy from 1980 until today up to 350 bn € per annum (see diagram on the right), thus continuously feeding their black money reserves. = Siemens corruption case = In 2007, Siemens was convicted in the District Court of Darmstadt of criminal corruption against the Italian corporation Enel Power SpA. Siemens had paid almost €3.5 million in bribes to be selected for a €200 million project from the Italian corporation, partially owned by the government. The deal was handled through black money accounts in Switzerland and Liechtenstein that were established specifically for such purposes. Because the crime was committed in 1999, after the OECD convention had come into force, this foreign corrupt practice could be prosecuted. It was the first time a German court of law convicted foreign corrupt practices like a national practice, although the corresponding law did not yet protect foreign competitors in business. During the judicial proceedings it was disclosed that numerous such black accounts had been established in the past decades.  Historical responses in philosophical and religious thought  Philosophers and religious thinkers have responded to the inescapable reality of corruption in different ways. Plato, in The Republic, acknowledges the corrupt nature of political institutions, and recommends that philosophers \\"shelter behind a wall\\" to avoid senselessly martyring themselves. Disciples of philosophy ... have tasted how sweet and blessed a possession philosophy is, and have also seen and been satisfied of the madness of the multitude, and known that there is no one who ever acts honestly in the administration of States, nor any helper who will save any one who maintains the cause of the just. Such a savior would be like a man who has fallen among wild beasts—unable to join in the wickedness of his fellows, neither would he be able alone to resist all their fierce natures, and therefore he would be of no use to the State or to his friends, and would have to throw away his life before he had done any good to himself or others. And he reflects upon all this, and holds his peace, and does his own business. He is like one who retires under the shelter of a wall in the storm of dust and sleet which the driving wind hurries along; and when he sees the rest of mankind full of wickedness, he is content if only he can live his own life and be pure from evil or unrighteousness, and depart in peace and good will, with bright hopes.Plato, Plato, Republic, 496d The New Testament, in keeping with the tradition of Ancient Greek thought, also frankly acknowledges the corruption of the world (ὁ κόσμος)2 Peter 1:4, 2:20. and claims to offer a way of keeping the spirit \\"unspotted from the world.\\"James 1:27. Paul of Tarsus acknowledges his readers must inevitably \\"deal with the world,\\"1 Cor 7:31. and recommends they adopt an attitude of \\"as if not\\" in all their dealings. When they buy a thing, for example, they should relate to it \\"as if it were not theirs to keep.\\"1 Cor 7:30. New Testament readers are advised to refuse to \\"conform to the present age\\"Romans 12:2. and not to be ashamed to be peculiar or singular.1 Peter 2:9. They are advised not be friends of the corrupt world, because \\"friendship with the world is enmity with God.\\"James 4:4. They are advised not to love the corrupt world or the things of the world.1 John 2:15. The rulers of this world, Paul explains, \\"are coming to nothing\\"1 Cor 2:6. While readers must obey corrupt rulers in order to live in the world,Romans 13:1. the spirit is subject to no law but to love God and love our neighbors as ourselves.Romans 13:8. New Testament readers are advised to adopt a disposition in which they are \\"in the world, but not of the world.\\"Andrew L. Fitz-Gibbon, In the World But Not of the World: Christian Social Thinking at the End of the Twentieth Century (2000), See also John 15:19.

Used by Apple Computer from 1984 to 1990, the scheme has vertical and horizontal stripes for decoration, ventilation, and the illusion that the computer enclosure is smaller than it actually is. The design language boosted Apple's global reputation, set design trends for the computer industry, and molded the perception of computers in the manufacturing and business world. Among other design features, Esslinger's presentation of the Apple logo--a three- dimensional logo inlaid into the product case with the product name printed onto its surface--was included on nearly every product for several years. History In 1982, Apple officials looked outside the company and indeed the country for a designer who could help them establish the firm as a world-class company. Snow White refers to the seven projects code-named after the Seven Dwarves on which the new design language was to be applied. Several designers were courted by Apple under the Snow White project to see what they would come up with for the seven products (of which there were actually eight). The winner ultimately was Esslinger and the resulting style assumed the project's code name.Kunkel, Paul. AppleDesign: The work of the Apple Industrial Design Group, with photographs by Rick English. New York: Graphis, 1997, p.30 The Apple IIc computer, and its peripherals, were the first Snow White design. Initially, Snow White debuted in a creamy off-white color known at Apple as \\"Fog\\"History of computer design: Apple IIc but later other products moved to the warm gray \\"Platinum\\" color, lighter than the previous Apple \\"Putty\\" color, used throughout the Apple product line from 1987 on. Esslinger favored a bright-white color originally for the IIc, but Jerry Manock successfully argued that it would attract fingerprints. Nevertheless, Esslinger detested the original Apple beige color and insisted all Snow White-styled products use the same off-white color as the IIc. Until the change to Platinum, no Snow White designs appeared in any other color, except for the Hard Disk 20SC in order to better match the beige color of the Macintosh Plus beneath which it was designed to sit. Beginning in 1990, the Apple Industrial Design Group gradually altered and phased out the use of the Snow White language. Design features Macintosh IIx Macintosh Portable The distinguishing characteristics originated by the Snow White design language, in contrast to the original Apple industrial design style, include the following: *minimal surface texturing *colored a light off-white (Fog) or light gray (Platinum) *inlaid three-dimensional Apple logo, diamond cut to the exact shape *zero-draft enclosures, with no variances in case thickness and perpendicular walls *recessed international port identification icons *silk-screened product name badging *shallow horizontal and vertical lines, 2 mm wide, 2 mm deep, spaced 10 mm apart on center, which run along any and all of the surfaces of the product, some of which act as vents and set back 30 mm from the front and 4 mm from the back *Fog products have beige accents and cables, Platinum products have uniform color (no accents) and Smoke gray cables *3 mm radius, rear and 2 mm radius, front corners *simple unadorned ports and slots Any or all of these features indicate a Snow White Frog Design influence over an otherwise Apple- designed product. In particular the first official implementation, the Apple IIc, does not represent the complete set of design elements, while the Macintosh II includes all of them. Later, the Macintosh LC began to phase out some of the design elements. Apple logo Implementation Apple products designed in the Snow White theme (all used the “Platinum” gray color scheme except as noted): Apple IIGS LaserWriter II Macintosh II *Apple IIc (1984) *Disc IIc (1984) *Apple Scribe Printer (1984) *Apple Mouse IIc (1984) *AppleTalk Connector Family(1985) *LaserWriter (1985) *ImageWriter II (1985) *Apple Personal Modem (1985) *Apple UniDisk 3.5 (1985) *LaserWriter Plus (1986) *Apple IIGS (1986) *Apple 3.5 Drive (1986) *Hard Disk 20SC (1986) *Macintosh SE series (1987) *Macintosh II (1987) *ImageWriter LQ (1987) *Apple PC 5.25 Drive (1987) *AppleFax Modem (1987) *Macintosh IIx (1988) *Apple IIc Plus (1988) *LaserWriter II (1988) *AppleCD SC (1988) *Apple Scanner (1988) *Apple FDHD External Drive (1988) *Macintosh Portable (1989) *Macintosh SE/30 (1989) *Macintosh IIfx (1990) :a:^ While the IIc generally gets credit for being the first Apple computer released in the Snow White design language, it was not a “pure” example. Rob Gemmel (who was instrumental in soliciting Esslinger) had designed the IIc a year earlier and unbeknownst to him, Frog Design was working on their own design. In the end it was a compromise of Gemmel’s original design and Frog Design’s modifications. Likewise, the Macintosh SE was essentially Manock and Oyama’s design updated with Snow White details. The IIgs, which introduced Platinum gray, also evidenced the legacy design of the original Apple II case, in particular Manock’s wedge-shape. It wasn’t until the Macintosh II when Frog Design finally had a clean slate on which to design from the ground up, that the first pure example of pure Snow White was realized. :b:^ Introduced in off-white “Fog” and later switched to “Platinum” gray :c:^ Off-white “Fog” only :d:^ Introduced simultaneously in both Apple/Macintosh beige and “Platinum” gray to better match the beige Macintosh Plus for which it was designed to sit beneath as well as conform to the Apple IIgs color scheme released at the same time. This would be the only Snow White product to intentionally use the original beige color for the purpose of matching existing products. :e:^ All Apple connectors and cables began a transition to beige in 1985, however, certain Macintosh peripheral cables (e.g. mice and disk drives), despite adopting the new connector style, retained their medium-brown appearance until the transition to Platinum in 1987, at which time all cables became a dark gray color Apple called “Smoke.” :f:^ Though technically beige, like the connectors & cables, the Mouse IIc is considered to be colored as a Fog co-ordinated accent. It is definitely a Snow White design, which elements form the basis for the subsequent Apple Desktop Bus Mouse. It was not produced in Platinum. Most Apple Displays introduced between 1984 and 1994 also used Snow White, except those specifically designed to match the Apple II series. All Apple ADB keyboards and mice introduced between 1986 and 1993 were Snow White designs. =Unofficial designs= Lisa 2/Macintosh XL Macintosh IIsi PowerBook 165 *The Lisa 2/Macintosh XL (1984) had Snow White stripes added to the front bezel redesign along with the inlaid Apple badging four months before the Apple IIc was introduced, technically making it the first Snow White product. *The Apple Modem 300/1200 (1985) was updated from Apple beige to Fog and the inlaid Apple badging was added. *The Macintosh Plus (1986) was updated by Frog Design, but only added the inlaid Apple badging and recessed connector icons. *The Macintosh 800K External Drive (1986) only included the inlaid Apple badging and simple floppy disk slot styling as well as the 2 and 3 mm radius corners and zero-draft enclosure. *The Macintosh IIcx (1989) was designed in-house entirely by Apple and, though drawing upon the Snow White corporate language, departed considerably from the guidelines. This was the beginning of Apple's efforts to break ties with Frog Design and rebuild the Industrial Design Group. *The Macintosh IIci (1989) basically the same case as the IIcx with different internal hardware. *Macintosh LC (1990) *Macintosh Quadra 700 (1991) *PowerBook 100/200 Series (1991) *Macintosh Quadra 900 (1991) *Macintosh Quadra 950 (1992) *PowerBook Duo Dock (1992) *Macintosh LC II (1992) *Macintosh IIsi (1993) *Macintosh LC III (1993) *Macintosh LC III+ (1993) *Macintosh LC 475 (1993) *Apple Workgroup Server 95 (1993) *Apple Workgroup Server 9150 (1994) Both the 100- and 200-series PowerBooks and accessories were intended to tie into the rest of the Apple desktop products using the corporate Snow White design language. However, the light colors and decorative recessed lines did not seem appropriate for the scaled-down designs. In addition to adopting the darker grey color scheme which co-ordinated with the official corporate look, they also adopted a raised series of ridges mimicking the indented lines on the desktops. These early PowerBooks would be the last to use the aging Snow White look and the only ones to make such a radical adaptation of it.

It may also refer to the state procedure in France by which National Heritage protection is extended to a building, a specific part of a building, a collection of buildings, garden, bridge, or other structure, because of their importance to France's architectural and historical cultural heritage.Bady, Jean-Pierre (1998). Les Monuments historiques en France. Presses Universitaires de France. p. 26. Both public and privately owned structures may be listed in this way, as well as movable objects. As of 2012 there were 44,236 monuments listed. Buildings may be given the classification for both their exteriors or interiors, including a building's décor, its furniture, a single room, or even a staircase. An example is the monument historique classification of the décor in the café \\"Deux Garçons\\" in Aix-en-Provence whose patrons once included Alphonse de Lamartine, Émile Zola and Paul Cézanne. Some buildings are designated because of their connection to a single personality, such as the Auberge Ravoux in Auvers-sur-Oise which is designated an MH because of its connection to the painter Vincent van Gogh. Since the 1990s, a significant number of places have been given the designation because of their historical importance to science. The MH designation traces its roots to the French Revolution when the government appointed Alexandre Lenoir to specify and safeguard certain structures. Though the first classifications were given in the 19th century by the writer Prosper Mérimée, inspector-general of historical monuments, by a first list established in 1840. In 1851, Mérimée organized the Missions Héliographiques to document France's medieval architecture. A \\"monument historique\\" may be marked by the official logo, distribute by the , a French historical restoration associations union. It consists of a design representing the labyrinth that used to be in Reims Cathedral, which is itself a World Heritage Site. Use of the logo is optional.  Protection  There are two levels of protection: * The \\"classement au titre des monuments historiques\\" is a national level of importance for the objects or buildings ; * The \\"inscription au titre des monuments historiques\\" is a regional level of importance for the objects or buildings (until 2005 formerly called \\"inventaire supplémentaire des monuments historiques\\", ISMH). These two levels of protection are determined after a thorough historical study by the préfet for the région, or by the Minister of Culture for the national level. They are aided by the advice of a commission named .  Examples  Density of monuments historiques by 100 km² (red is the highest) Examples of buildings classified as monument historique include well known Parisian structures such as the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, and the Palais Garnier opera house, plus abbeys, churches such as Corbiac, and cathedrals such as Notre Dame de Paris or hotels such as the Crillon. Many of the Châteaux of the Loire Valley, such as Château de Montsoreau, carry the MH designation, as do the renowned gardens at Château de Villandry and the home and gardens of Claude Monet in Giverny. The scope of the monuments covered is broad enough to include individual tombs of important people, for example, Napoleon I as well as less eminent people such as Agnès Souret, the first Miss France, whose tomb is in the Basque Country.

The S. 2917 legislation created the Mining Enforcement and Safety Administration (MESA), later renamed the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), as well as a National Mine Map Repository, within the Department of the Interior. MSHAs responsibilities paralleled those of Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) but addressed underground and surface mining of coal. The legislation was more comprehensive and stringent than previous federal laws governing the mining industry. The Coal Act required two annual inspections of every surface coal mine and four at every underground coal mine, and dramatically increased federal enforcement powers in coal mines. The Coal Act also required monetary penalties for all violations, and established criminal penalties for knowing and willful violations. The safety standards for all coal mines were strengthened, and health standards were adopted. The Coal Act also included specific procedures for the development of improved mandatory health and safety standards, and provided compensation for miners who were totally and permanently disabled by the progressive respiratory disease caused by the inhalation of fine coal dust pneumoconiosis or \\"black lung\\". In regard to the mine map repository, the Coal Act required that: \\"Whenever an operator permanently closes or abandons a coal mine, or temporarily closes a coal mine for a period of more than ninety days, he shall promptly notify the Secretary of such closure. Within sixty days of the permanent closure or abandonment of the mine, or, when the mine is temporarily closed, upon the expiration of a period of ninety days from the date of closure, the operator shall file with the Secretary a copy of the mine map revised and supplemented to the date of the closure.\\" Initial enforcement of the law was slow due to understaffed enforcement agencies, a situation which was criticized when the Hurricane Creek mine disaster occurred a year to the day after passage of the act, killing 38 men in a mine with a long history of violations. It was updated by the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, Public Law 95-164.

Following Confederation, and after William Pearce Howland resigned to become Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, Amos Wright gained his seat in the House of Commons of Canada in a federal by- election on August 14, 1868, and came to represent York West. He retired from politics on July 8, 1872, before the next election. Later life In 1875 Wright was appointed Federal Indian Agent and Ontario's Crown Agent for the Thunder Bay area; (Wright resided in the then-named Port Arthur). While his Provincial appointment lasted until 1886, he was involved in a controversy due to an alleged conflict of interest in his Federal capacity of Indian Agent. In this controversy, religious issues are also said to have played a part; in any case, Wright, a Methodist from an essentially Protestant background, was replaced as Federal Indian Agent in 1883. Amos Wright was active in public life well into his seventies. Known as a well-liked figure with very wide connections, in his political life he was seen as a representative who, particularly in his earlier career, took a nuanced position on some of the key issues of the day: arguably, such a stance at times both smoothed and hindered his political advancement, but his popularity was undoubted. The Toronto Daily Patriot and Express even stated he was \\"as bewildered with unexpected honors as an interesting widow giving herself away in matrimony for the fourth time\\". While undoubtedly unfair, this comment serves to hint at the transition which his life encompassed from his early days in farming and involvement in local parish affairs, to the sometimes tumultuous political events of the Federal Parliament, as the new Dominion expanded westward. He died at Port Arthur on March 31, 1886, and was buried in Richmond Hill. Richmond Hill Heritage Centre Amos Wright's house, an 1840s Regency-style dwelling in Church Street, Richmond Hill, Ontario, is designated as Richmond Hill Heritage Centre, adjoining a park named for Wright.

(December 13, 1846 – December 31, 1916) was an American essayist, editor, critic, and lecturer. Biography He was born at Cold Spring, N. Y. in 1846. Mabie was the youngest child of Sarah Colwell Mabie who was from a wealthy Scottish- English family and Levi Jeremiah Mabie, whose ancestors were Scots-Dutch. They were early immigrants to New Amsterdam, New Netherland about 1647. Due to business opportunities with the opening of the Erie Canal his family moved to Buffalo, New York when he was approaching school age. At the young age of 16 he passed his college entrance examination, but waited a year before he attended Williams College (1867) and the Columbia Law School (1869). While at Williams, Mabie was a member of Alpha Delta Phi fraternity and would serve as the first president of the North American Interfraternity Conference (formally known as the National Interfraternity Conference). He received honorary degrees from his own alma mater, from Union College, and from Western Reserve and Washington and Lee universities. Although he passed his bar exams in 1869 he hated both the study and practice of law. In 1876 he married Jeanette Trivett. In the summer of 1879 he was hired to work at the weekly magazine, Christian Union (renamed The Outlook in 1893), an association that lasted until his death. In 1884, Mabie was promoted to associate editor of the Christian Union and then elected to the Author's Club, whose members included such men of established reputation as George Cary Eggleston, Richard Watson Gilder, Brander Matthews, and Edmund Clarence Stedman. In 1890, a small collection of Mabie's essays which reflected upon life, literature and nature were published as a volume entitled My Study Fire.

Crocin is the chemical primarily responsible for the color of saffron. Chemically, crocin is the diester formed from the disaccharide gentiobiose and the dicarboxylic acid crocetin. When isolated as a pure chemical compound, it has a deep red color and forms crystals with a melting point of 186 °C. When dissolved in water, it forms an orange solution. The term crocins may also refer to members of a series of related hydrophilic carotenoids that are either monoglycosyl or diglycosyl polyene esters of crocetin. The crocin underlying saffron's aroma is α-crocin (a carotenoid pigment that may compose more than 10% of dry saffron's mass): trans-crocetin di-(β-D-gentiobiosyl) ester; it bears the systematic (IUPAC) name 8,8-diapo-8,8-carotenoic acid. The major active component of saffron is the yellow pigment crocin 2 (three other derivatives with different glycosylations are known) containing a gentiobiose (disaccharide) group at each end of the molecule. The five major biologically active components of saffron, namely the four crocins and crocetin, can be measured with HPLC-UV. Physiological effects on mammalian tissues and organisms Crocin has been shown to be an antioxidant, and neural protective agent. The antioxidant behavior of crocin is related to the sugar moiety in crocin molecule which has a vital role in its chemical reactivity. It has also been shown to have an antiproliferative action against cancer cells in vitro. Limited evidence suggests possible antidepressant properties of crocin in mice and humans.

It was built in 1869 for John Hamilton, President of the Merchant's Bank of Montreal, Quebec. In 1889, Sir William Cornelius Van Horne, President of the Canadian Pacific Railway, purchased the property and it remained in his family until it was controversially demolished in 1973. Despite the public outcry over its proposed destruction, Mayor Jean Drapeau declared that it could not be preserved for cultural reasons as it was not part of Quebec's culture, its history being Anglo Canadian, not French Canadian. With Drapeau's support, it was bulldozed in the middle of the night by developer David Azrieli, who replaced it with a concrete tower block. The Sofitel Hotel today stands at the spot once occupied by the Van Horne mansion. History Van Horne House, c. 1900 Van Horne hired Bruce Price's architectural firm, who had done much of the work for the Canadian Pacific Railway, to enlarge the old Hamilton's Italianate house to fifty-two rooms. Hamilton had hired architect John William Hopkins (also with Daniel Berkley Wily) and was completed in 1869.http://www.dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/node/1525 It was Edward Colonna (died 1948), an architect who had previously worked for Louis Comfort Tiffany before being hired by Price, who carried out the alterations to the Van Horne house. Colonna redid the entire ground floor and possibly much of the first floor, creating a spacious area with well-proportioned rooms and plenty of wall-space for Van Horne's art collection. The interior of Van Horne's house, from its fireplaces, ceilings and gold leaf walls, was the first example of art nouveau in Canada.From Telegrapher to Titan: The Life of William C. Van Horne - Valerie Knowles (2004) Van Horne claimed to like homes \\"big and bulky like myself\\",The Square Mile (1987), by Donald MacKay but he had one of the best private art and pottery collections in North America and wanted a house he could share with it. The building was damaged by a fire on Monday, April 3, 1933, which led to the loss of part of Van Horne's private art collection. Van Horne Art Collection As a child, Van Horne collected fossils. He was also an excellent violinist and artist in his own right. When he was older, Van Horne was not just a serious collector, he had a passion for art: \\"A picture that you feel you do not really want is always an incubus and a source of dissatisfaction\\". He started collecting on his business trips around the world in the 1880s. By 1892, he had confidence enough in his knowledge to catalogue his most prized possessions, now found in the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts. He not only built up the most important collection in Canada, but added to it a comprehensive library on art history. He was meticulous in not just his choice of paintings, but also in his studies into the lives of the artists too. His collection featured the works of Velázquez, Hals, Rembrandt, Hogarth, Gainsborough, Reynolds, Constable and Turner.See Finding aid for Van Horne Family \\"Fonds CA OTAG SC065\\" on Art Gallery of Ontario website He also collected many modern works, and in his catalogue of 1892, all but two of the forty nine works listed were from the 19th century. In 1926 Caroline Pierson, the granddaughter of Allard Pierson, visited his daughter Adeline van Horne, and after viewing the collection, she wrote a letter describing what she saw, mentioning 4 Rembrandts, 4 Frans Hals, and a Bol and a Fabricius in the \\"red room\\".De Van Horne collectie: Montreal 1926, 1933 en 1972 by Mary Eggermont-Molenaar In April 1933 a fire damaged some of the paintings, but the same year Frits Lugt paid a visit to an exhibition of the collection and made notes about several of the same paintings, indicating they were not all lost. In 1972 Ernst van de Wetering and Professor Levie, as representatives of the Rembrandt Research Project, paid a visit to Margaret (Hannon) Van Horne, widow of grandson Billy van Horne, to inspect the 4 Rembrandts.

Although emerging late in the reign of the dinosaurs, Bagaceratops had a fairly primitive anatomy and kept the small body size that characterized early ceratopsians. History of discovery The first remains of Bagaceratops were discovered in the Gobi Desert during the 1970s by a joint expedition composed of Mongolian and Polish scientists and it was described by two of the expeditions leading scientists, Teresa Maryanska and Halszka Osmólska (1975). Several of these Bagaceratops specimens are at Poland's Paleobiological Institute in Warsaw. Skull cast of a juvenile (right), along with skulls of Psittacosaurus (center) and Protoceratops (left) Bagaceratops is known from five complete and twenty partial crania, the longest of which is 17 cm long. The skulls are spread throughout the life stages of the animal, with the smallest being only 4.7 cm long, so the growth stages are relatively well understood. The smaller juvenile skulls were about the same size as a golf ball. Only fragmentary remains of Bagaceratops post-cranial anatomy have been found. Juvenile remains, at first tentatively named Protoceratops kozlowskii, and then renamed Breviceratops kozlowskii by Kurzanov in 1990 are now felt to be juvenile Bagaceratops. Paul Sereno (2000) explained this by extrapolating that the juvenile Breviceratops would grow into a mature Bagaceratops. The type and only species, B. rozhdestvenskyi, was named in honor of the Russian paleontologist Anatoly Konstantinovich Rozhdestvensky. The holotype is ZPAL MgD-I/126, a medium-sized skull from the Hermiin Tsav locality of the Barun Goyot Formation, during the Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous. A study on the nature of the observed variation in morphology and size of skulls of Bagaceratops was performed by Łukasz Czepiński in 2019, who also considered the species Gobiceratops minutus, Lamaceratops tereschenkoi, Platyceratops tatarinovi and Magnirostris dodsoni to be potential growth stages of B. rozhdestvenskyi and therefore, junior synonyms. Though the genus remained for a long time without postcranial remains, the first skeleton of Bagaceratops was discovered in 2007 also from the Hermiin Tsav locality of the Barun Goyot Formation, and described by Bitnara Kim and colleagues during 2019. The specimen was catalogued as KID196 and includes a partially complete individual. Description Life restoration Bagaceratops grew to an adult size of about long, high, and weighed around . It had a smaller frill (which lacked fenestrae), and only ten grinding teeth per jaw, and more triangular skull than its close relative, Protoceratops. Bagaceratops evolved later but retains more primitive characteristics than its earlier relative.\\"Bagaceratops.\\" In: Dodson, Peter & Britt, Brooks & Carpenter, Kenneth & Forster, Catherine A. & Gillette, David D. & Norell, Mark A. & Olshevsky, George & Parrish, J. Michael & Weishampel, David B. The Age of Dinosaurs. Publications International, LTD. p. 132. . Otherwise the two dinosaurs were very similar, each had a beak but no brow horns, and a small horn-like prominence on the snout. Classification Bagaceratops belonged to the Ceratopsia, a group of herbivorous dinosaurs with parrot-like beaks which thrived in North America and Asia during the Cretaceous Period, which ended roughly 66 million years ago. Diet Bagaceratops, like all ceratopsians, was a herbivore.

History The idea for the foundation was made in 1968 by Joan Miró. Miró formed the foundation with his friend Joan Prats. Miró wanted to create a new building that would encourage particularly younger artists to experiment with contemporary art. The building was designed by Josep Lluís Sert to ensure that this work could also be made available to the public and exhibited. He designed the building with courtyards and terraces and to create a natural path for visitors to move through the building. Building began on the mountain of Montjuïc and the foundation opened on 10 June 1975. Not only was the architect a close friend of Miró but so was the first president Joaquim Gomis and Miró was amongst the first board. It was claimed that the new foundation represented a new way of viewing the concept of a museum and how the people of Barcelona could relate to their cultural heritage.Sert. P.8 4 Wings by Alexander Calder in the garden Expansion in 1986 to the building added an auditorium and a library which holds some of the 10,000 items in the Foundation and Miró's collection. Works by Joan Miró Many of the works in the building were donated by the artist himself.Fundació Joan Miró, Barcelona.de, accessed September 2011 Highlights include: *The wing of the lark ..., 1967 *Hermitage of San Juan Huerta, 1917 *Street Pedralbes, 1917 *Portrait of a boy, 1919 *Painting (the white gloves), 1925 *Flame in space and Naked woman, 1932 *Character, 1934 *Man and Woman in Front of a Pile of Excrement, 1935 *Naked woman climbing a staircase, 1937 *No, 1937 *The Morning Star, 1940 *Barcelona Series, 1944 *The Diamond smiles at twilight, 1947–1948 *The Caress of a Bird, 1967 *The gold of the azure, 1967 *Painting on white to a solitary cell I, II, III, 1968 *Figure in front of the sun, 1968 *Catalan peasant by moonlight, 1968 *Miró's Chicago, 1968 *Character, 1970, May 1968, 1968–1973 *Tapestry of the Fundació, 1979 Collection In line with Miró's original idea the Foundation has a space named \\"\\" which is dedicated to promoting the work of young experimental artists. Although there is also work by Peter Greenaway, Chillida, René Magritte, Rothko, Tàpies and Saura. The collection includes Alexander Calder's 4 Wings and Mercury Fountain. The Mercury Fountain uses the liquid metal mercury to create a fountain. As mercury is poisonous, the fountain is kept behind glass to protect the visitors. The museum uses QRpedia to allow visitors to read Wikipedia articles about objects in the collection, translated into their preferred language.  Espai 13  The Fundació Joan Miró has had a space for exhibiting contemporary art, with regular and continuous programming. Espai 10, active since 1978, and Espai 13, which took over after 1989 to continue through to the present day, together offer an area of analysis that is unique within Spain and also Europe as a whole. This exhibition space has been working as a laboratory of cutting-edge art, a space for programming experimental exhibitions of contemporary art, and has functioned over more than three decades in a major institution as an art centre within an institution. Besides providing a venue for local artists, it has also been a place of constant international interchange. Moreover, the broad span of over thirty years has made it possible not only to analyse the history of movements, patterns and trends in art but also to detect intersections between different generations and languages. In brief, Espai 10 and Espai 13 provide a privileged place from which to study, moreover, the ways in which theories and socio-political contexts have kept influencing artistic production over the decades when the different kinds of infrastructure that opened up the field of contemporary Spanish and Catalan art were taking shape. Hence, the history of Espai 10 and Espai 13 may be viewed as that of a well-informed witness, or an archive that can be compared and contrasted with many others from the same period.Segade, Manuel, Haver fet un lloc on els artistes tinguin dret a equivocar-se.

He is most commonly associated with his restoration designs for Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim, Norway.Arkitekter: Johan Olaf Brochmann Nordhagen (Norske arkitekter og arkitekter på norsk grunn)Nidaros Cathedral (memim.com) Biography Olaf Nordhagen was born in Christiania (now Oslo), Norway. He was a son of painter and artist Johan Nordhagen (1856–1956) and Christine Magdalene Brochmann Johansen (1858–1933). He was a brother of botanist Rolf Nordhagen and through him an uncle of art historian Per Jonas Nordhagen. In April 1909 in Ådal he married Thora Hval (1887–1960). Nordhagen was educated as an engineer at Christiania tekniske skole in Oslo and worked as an apprentice to architect Bredo Greve for several years before studying at the Royal Danish Academy of Art while also assisting Martin Nyrop with his designs for Copenhagen City Hall. Nordhagen returned to Oslo in 1906 and accepted a number of smaller commissions. His breakthrough, however, came when he won the competition to build the Bergen Public Library (Bergen Offentlige Bibliotek) in Art Nouveau (Jugendstil), for which he also won the Houen Fund prize (Houens fonds premie). Olaf Nordhagen, Ingeniør, arkitekt og kunstner (Høgskolen i Oslo og Akershus) Nordhagen designed a number of industrial structures including transformer stations and power plants, including Såheim Hydroelectric Power Station in Rjukan (with Thorvald Astrup). He also designed several churches and completed considerable research around Norwegian traditional architecture. Dating from 1913, he was also a professor at the Norwegian Institute of Technology in Trondheim. Olaf Nordhagen, arkitekt (Norsk kunstnerleksikon. Forfatter,Dag Myklebust) Olaf Nordhagen is probably most famous for the restoration designs of the Nidaros Cathedral. He took over project management of this work following the death in 1906 of architect Christian Christie. Nordhagen carried it through until his own death in 1925. His tendency to reinterpret Gothic designs rather than seek a faithful reproduction of the original was controversial at the time but was carried out.

The château has not been modified externally since its construction and still has a fully working drawbridge.Château du Plessis-Bourré: video of working drawbridge It was classified as a Monument historique in 1931. The château was purchased in 1911 by Henry Vaïsse who, when he died in 1956, bequeathed it to his nephew, François Reille-Soult, Duke of Dalmatie, descendant of the marshals of the French empire Soult, Reille and Masséna. In 1978, Antoinette de Ferrières de Sauvebœuf, born de Croix, granddaughter of the Duke of Dalmatie, and her spouse Bruno de Ferrières de Sauvebœuf took the responsibility of heading the renovation and maintenance of the château until 2009.

It forms brick red crystals with a melting point of 285 °C. The chemical structure of crocetin forms the central core of crocin, the compound responsible for the color of saffron. Cell studies Crocin and crocetin may provide neuroprotection in rats by reducing the production of various neurotoxic molecules, based on an in-vitro cell study. Physiological effects A 2009 study involving 14 individuals indicated that oral administration of crocetin may decrease the effects of physical fatigue in healthy men. A 2010 pilot study investigated the effect of crocetin on sleep. The clinical trial comprised a double-blind, placebo- controlled, crossover trial of 21 healthy adult men with a mild sleep complaint. It concluded that crocetin may (p=0.025) contribute to improving the quality of sleep. In high concentrations, it has protective effects against retinal damage in vitro and in vivo. Transcrocetinate sodium The sodium salt of crocetin, transcrocetinate sodium (INN, also known as trans sodium crocetinate or TSC) is an experimental drug that increases the movement of oxygen from red blood cells into hypoxic (oxygen-starved) tissues. Transcrocetinate sodium belongs to a group of substances known as bipolar trans carotenoid salts, which constitute a subclass of oxygen diffusion- enhancing compounds. Transcrocetinate sodium was one of the first such compounds discovered. Transcrocetinate sodium Transcrocetinate sodium can be prepared by reacting saffron with sodium hydroxide and extracting the salt of the trans crocetin isomer from the solution. John L. Gainer and colleagues have investigated the effects of transcrocetinate sodium in animal models. They discovered that the drug could reverse the potentially fatal decrease in blood pressure produced by the loss of large volumes of blood in severe hemorrhage, and thereby improve survival. Early investigations of transcrocetinate sodium suggested that it had potential applications in battlefield medicine, specifically in treatment of the many combat casualties with hemorrhagic shock. Additional studies, carried out in animal models and in clinical trials in humans, indicated that transcrocetinate sodium might prove beneficial in the treatment of a variety of conditions associated with hypoxia and ischemia (a lack of oxygen reaching the tissues, usually due to a disruption in the circulatory system), including cancer, myocardial infarction (heart attack), and stroke. Transcrocetinate sodium has shown promise of effectiveness in restoring tissue oxygen levels and improving the ability to walk in a clinical trial of patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) in which reduced delivery of oxygen-rich blood to tissues can cause severe leg pain and impair mobility. The drug has also been under investigation in a clinical trial sponsored by drug developer Diffusion Pharmaceuticals for potential use as a radiosensitizer, increasing the susceptibility of hypoxic cancer cells to radiation therapy, in patients with a form of brain cancer known as glioblastoma. The drug is currently under investigation for its possible use in enhancing the oxygenation status of COVID-19 patients at risk for developing multiple organ failure due to severe respiratory distress. =Mechanism of action= Similar to other oxygen diffusion-enhancing compounds, transcrocetinate sodium appears to improve oxygenation in hypoxic tissues by exerting hydrophobic effects on water molecules in blood plasma and thereby increasing the hydrogen bonding between the water molecules. This in turn causes the overall organization of water molecules in plasma to become more structured, which facilitates the diffusion of oxygen through plasma and promotes the movement of oxygen into tissues. Trans-crocetin has been found to act as an NMDA receptor antagonist with high affinity, and has been implicated in the psychoactivity of Saffron.

Started in 1998 by a group of volunteers, GfG was led by industry veteran Lynne Killey. It raises money and requests that game publishers donate video and computer games to them for re-distribution to children's charities. It hosts dinners, silent auctions and parties. In just a few years, the small undertaking had grown too large for a volunteer staff to handle and the effort was left dormant. In the following years several other game industry charities took up the effort of supporting individual children's charities in meaningful and productive ways, but none utilizing the repository model of supporting other charities. The IEMA (Interactive Entertainment Merchants Association), the U.S. trade association which represents the game industry's leading retailers, began receiving in three finished copies of each and every computer game manufactured due to a royalty-free licensing agreement that the association has with publishers. That agreement standardized the PC game box - reducing it from the oversized software standard, down to the now double-thick DVD size that we're all used to - and also standardized the PC CD and PC DVD icons (the small black and white logos that indicate the platform the game is created for). The IEMA has been donating the games to children's hospitals and local area charities and schools when long-time friends Lynne Killey (the founder of GfG) and Hal Halpin (the president of the IEMA) decided to restart the organizations. Now re-launched, Games for Good is being run by the IEMA's staff. In addition to asking game publishers and developers to provide the three finished copies of each PC game they make, GfG is also asking for them to commit to providing three finished copies of all games they create on all platforms AND to help them with sponsorship funds.

It serves as a connector between the village of Goshen and the city of Newburgh. It has for a long time provided the main access to Stewart International Airport. The highway follows the path of the old Goshen–Newburgh Turnpike and is a two-lane road through its entire length. It is also shared with New York State Bicycle Route 17\\\\. Route description NY 207 crossing through the hamlet of Campbell Hall NY 207 begins at exit 124 of the Quickway (NY 17 and US 6) and a junction with NY 17M in the village of Goshen. Also present at the intersection is NY 17A, which terminates at the same junction and whose right- of-way becomes NY 207\\\\. Entering downtown Goshen, NY 207 gains the Greenwich Avenue moniker, until reaching the junction with Church Street, where it turns onto Main Street. Once straightening to the north, the route crosses past the Harness Racing Museum & Hall of Fame and the Orange County Government Center. Near the junction with Victoria Terrace, NY 207 leaves the village of Goshen, dropping the Main Street moniker as it winds north through the town of Goshen. A two-lane countryside roadway, NY 207 reaches the hamlet of Kipps, bending northwest at a junction with Kipp Road, then darting northeast into the town of Hamptonburgh. Winding past the hamlet of Lagrange, the route starts passing multiple farms, passing the terminus of County Route 53 (CR 53 or Stony Ford Road). A short distance later, NY 207 reaches a junction with CR 77 (Egbertson Road), which connects to the Metro-North Railroad's Campbell Hall station. A short distance after, the route crosses under the Port Jervis Line and into a junction with the southern terminus of NY 416. Countryside along NY 207 in the town of Hamptonburgh At NY 416, NY 207 turns eastward through Hamptonburgh, entering the hamlet of Campbell Hall, crossing over the former Erie Railroad Montgomery Branch (now used by Norfolk Southern) and past the station site. Continuing east through Campbell Hall, the route crosses the Otter Kill and turns northeast through Hamptonburgh as a two-lane road. After making another bend to the southeast, NY 207 crosses south of the Otterkill Golf & Country Club, passing the northern terminus of CR 33 (Shea Road). A short distance east of the CR 33 junction, NY 207 reaches a junction with NY 208, forming a short concurrency through Hamptonburgh. After crossing a bridge over Smith Pond, NY 207 and NY 208 split, with NY 207 climbing a hill to the northeast. Passing the hamlet of Burnside, NY 207 turns east and leaves the town of Hamptonburgh for the town of New Windsor. Near the junction with West Green Road, the route gains the moniker of Little Britain Road, crossing through the hamlet of Rock Tavern. Winding east through New Windsor, the route eventually reaches the hamlet of Little Britain, which marks the southern terminus of NY 747 (Drury Lane). Continuing past the southern ends of the grounds for Stewart International Airport, NY 207 continues through the town of New Windsor past multiple roads that cross through the airport. A short distance to the east, the route crosses under the New York State Thruway (I-87) and into a junction with NY 300 (Union Boulevard). NY 207 and NY 300 become concurrent along Little Britain Road, reaching a large junction with Temple Hill Road, where NY 300 turns southeast, while NY 207 continues northeast along Little Britain. Immediately after the junction, NY 207 crosses Lake Washington and bypasses the hamlet of New Windsor to the north. The two-lane road winds northeast through New Windsor, soon leaving for the town of Newburgh. Still known as Little Britain Road, NY 207 crosses northeast through Newburgh, reaching a junction with Wisner Avenue. At this junction, the route used to turn north onto Wisner, going two blocks north to a junction with NY 17K. Today the route bypasses Wisner Avenue and continues along Little Britain Road, passing through an intersection with Washington Terrace before it reaches NY 17K. History NY 207 was assigned to its current alignment as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. When it was widened, the short section concurrent with NY 300 was relocated just to the south. The former right of way can still be seen. While much of the countryside surrounding NY 207 is rural and picturesque, increasing development within the county has given it the highest growth in traffic volume of any Orange County state highway in the early 2000s, according to New York State Department of Transportation data analyzed by the Times Herald-Record.Also see this attached map and chart.

Alice Goodwin, mother of two, school nurse and wife of an aspiring dairy farmer in Wisconsin, is getting ready to take her two daughters and her best friend’s, Theresa's, two little girls to their farm pond to swim. When she goes upstairs to find her bathing suit, Lizzy, Theresa's 2-year-old, slips away to the pond and drowns. Alice is consumed with guilt while her husband Howard silently distracts himself with the hard work of running their farm. Although Alice had never been entirely comfortable living in their small town, and the townspeople had never been fully accepting of Alice and Howard, who were viewed as hippies trying their hand at farming, she and Howard found their farm to be a comforting refuge. With the drowning, however, the townspeople sharpen their disapproval of Alice which then encourages a woman, whom Alice reprimanded for constantly bringing her sick son to school, to accuse Alice of molesting her child. Several other mothers then also come forward with tales of Alice's \\"abuse.\\" Alice's and Howard’s lives are shattered. Alice is imprisoned with a group of younger women whose life circumstances seem vastly different from hers, but for whom Alice develops a respect for their unvarnished honesty. While Alice is in the Racine County Jail, Howard tries to cope with running their farm, visiting Alice in jail, and caring for their girls, but becomes despondent and overwhelmed. He is saved when Theresa, who is still grief-stricken, but has forgiven Alice, offers her help with caring for the girls. Theresa and Howard become close causing both of them to feel gratitude and remorse; they end the relationship before they become romantically involved. The book is narrated in three parts: Alice narrates the first part looking back a year later to describe their lives immediately before and after Lizzy’s death; Howard narrates the second part describing his struggles while Alice is in jail, and Alice again narrates the third part describing her release on bail and the subsequent trial. In speaking, Alice has a habit of making off-beat, eccentric observations, which Howard finds annoying, but which also lends her narration an air of tragicomedy. Howard describes his increasing desperation that leads him to bond with Theresa, but then to sell their beloved farm to raise funds for Alice’s release on bail. Alice’s trial for molestation highlights the workings of the legal system and especially the hysteria that can arise from accusations of mass child molestations. While Alice is ultimately acquitted, she and Howard know that their lives can never be fully mended. The power of forgiveness is one of the central themes throughout the book. Alice is unable to forgive herself after Lizzy’s drowning even while Theresa finds it in her heart and faith to forgive Alice. Reception Kirkus Reviews calls A Map of the World a 'strong, compelling story', one that 'maps the best and worst of the human heart and all the mysterious, uncharted country in between.' Publishers Weekly draws attention to the spare honesty of Hamilton's writing and the story's 'universal implications.'

Kvaternik was military commander and Minister of Domobranstvo (Armed Forces). On 10 April 1941 he declared the creation of the Independent State of Croatia. Kvaternik was an officer in the Austro-Hungarian Army and was involved in World War I. After collapse of the Austria-Hungary he joined the National Council of State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, and became Chief of the General Staff of the unrecognized State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs .As such, he defended the region of Međimurje against Hungarians . He later transferred to the Royal Yugoslav Army and remained there until 1921. In 1929, he was one of the founders of the Ustaša-Croatian Revolutionary Movement in Italy. After Germany invaded Yugoslavia in March 1941, he declared the creation of the Independent State of Croatia on 10 April 1941 with the support of the Axis. In the newly created state, he became the Minister of the Armed Forces and in 1943 he retired. Early life Slavko Kvaternik was born in Moravice (then known as Komorske Moravice) in the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia of Austria-Hungary on 25 August 1878, the son of Ljudevit, a postman, and his wife, Marija (née Frank), who was of German descent from Bavaria and Catholic by religion. Slavko Kvaternik married Olga Frank, daughter of Josip Frank, a Croatian nationalist politician of Jewish descent, who converted from Judaism to Roman Catholicism. Their son, Dido, was a member of the Ustasha. At the end of August 1941, Olga Frank committed suicide, probably because of her Jewish origins and the role of her husband, and especially her son Dido, in the NDH. During World War I, Kvaternik served as an adjutant of field marshal Svetozar Boroević and was awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class. In 1918 he joined the newly formed National Council of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, becoming the Chief of General Staff. At the end of the year, Kvaternik commanded Croatian troops during the successful campaign in Međimurje against the Hungarian army. World War II After the German invasion of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia on 6 April 1941, the Ustaše formed their government with Ante Pavelić as leader. Four days later Kvaternik proclaimed the establishment of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH) and formed the first Ustasha government. At the same time, at Kvaternik's request, Vladko Maček (the leader of the Croatian Peasant Party, who had refused to cooperate with the Germans when they requested he lead the new nation) told the people to cooperate with the new regime. Kvaternik's position at this time was commander-in-chief of the Croatian Armed Forces. This carried the title of vojskovođa (marshal). The Croatian Home Guard was established on 11 April. He stayed at this position until his retirement on 4 January 1943.\\"Tko je tko u NDH\\", Minerva, Zagreb, 1997; , str. 226–227. He was awarded the 1st Class Cross of the Military Order of the Iron Trefoil during his service to the NDH. This award gave him the title of vitez (knight), which is sometimes included in his name. Death After the Second World War's end, Kvaternik was captured by US army and extradited to Yugoslavia where he was tried and sentenced to death for his crimes during NDH regime.

He is the editor of Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas, a three- volume collection of anarchist writings from ancient China to the present day. Volume One, subtitled \\"From Anarchy to Anarchism\\", covers the period from 300CE to 1939. Volume 2, subtitled \\"The Emergence of the New Anarchism,\\" covers the period from 1939, when the Spanish anarchists were defeated and the Second World War began, to 1977, by which time the world had witnessed a remarkable resurgence in anarchist ideas and movements. Volume 3, subtitled \\"The New Anarchism,\\" covers the period from 1974 to 2012, showcasing the different currents in anarchist theory and practice which have developed since the 1970s. The anthology is published by Black Rose Books. Each selection is introduced by Robert Graham, placing each author and selection in their historical and ideological context. The focus of the anthology is on the origins and development of anarchist ideas. It is not a documentary history of the world's various anarchist movements, although there is a wealth of material from many different areas, including not only Europe and North America, but also Latin America, China, Japan, Korea, India, Australia, Africa and the Middle East. Graham is also the author of many articles on the history of anarchist ideas and contemporary anarchist theory. He was an editor and contributor to the North American anarchist newsjournal, Open Road, for which he interviewed both Murray Bookchin and Noam Chomsky (the latter interview, \\"The Manufacture of Consent,\\" has been reprinted in Carlos Otero's collection of Chomsky interviews, Language and Politics). Drawing on the work of the feminist political theorist, Carole Pateman, Graham has argued in favour of a conception of direct democracy based on the notion of self-assumed obligation, which emphasizes the right of minority dissent as opposed to simple majority rule. His view of anarchism is similar to anarchist communists, such as Peter Kropotkin, and communitarian anarchists, such as Colin Ward, advocating horizontal webs of ever-changing voluntary associations dealing with all aspects of social life. In 2015, he published a book on the origins of the anarchist movement from the debates and struggles within the International Workingmen's Association (the so-called \\"First International\\") during the 1860s and 1870s in Europe, entitled We Do Not Fear Anarchy - We Invoke It: The First International and the Origins of the Anarchist Movement, published by AK Press. The quotation in the title is taken from Michael Bakunin, written around the time that he officially joined the International in 1868. More recently, Graham has published \\"Anarchy and Democracy\\" in the Anarcho- Syndicalist Review, No. 69, Winter 2017, in which he discusses the relation between anarchism and democratic theory, and \\"(Mis)Conceptions of Anarchism,\\" in Anarchist Studies, Volume 26, No. 2 (2018), in which he reviews the different ways of conceiving of anarchism - metaphysical, ontological, deontological, philosophical and political - and presents a definition of anarchism as a political theory based on six interrelated concepts: anti- authoritarianism, anti-statism, anti-parliamentarianism, federalism (voluntary association), libertarianism (libertarian means to achieve anarchist ends), and direct action.

He was the second son of Harry G. and Amelia Crawford Devlin. The Devlins first settled in Elizabeth, New Jersey in 1922, where Devlin attended Thomas Jefferson High School. In 1935, he entered Syracuse University to major in illustration, despite his family's encouragement of a career in medicine. In Devlin's senior year he met Dorothy Wende, a junior from Buffalo, New York majoring in Fine Arts. Dorothy is a distinguished portrait and still life painter, poet and children's book author. In 1939, Harry graduated from Syracuse and moved to a studio in New York City. Harry Devlin married Dorothy Wende in 1941. Harry and Dorothy moved to Mountainside, New Jersey in 1950, where the couple raised their seven children. Devlin has been focusing on Victorian Architecture for more than 30 years. There are shows by Harry Devlin at the Morris Museum including a sizable show of children's book illustrations, most of which are in collaboration with his wife, Wende.VIVIEN RAYNOR. \\"ART; Urban-Suburban Scenes and Unlikely Shapes.\\" The New York Times, (27 Jan. 1991): 16. Devlin died on November 25, 2001 at the age of 83. Career Devlin started his career primarily in magazine illustration. After the beginning of World War II, he began his active duty in the U.S. Navy as an ensign, where he was assigned to the Identification and Characteristics Office of Naval Intelligence. There he assumed responsibility for all illustrations and technical drawings published in manuals that were used by U.S. fliers to identify enemy planes. He was so proficient that by 1945, he had illustrated all Japanese, German, and Italian aircraft. Rising to the rank of lieutenant at the end of World War II, Devlin returned to a private life and began a ten-year association with Collier's Weekly. He created editorial cartoons and illustrations for the magazine’s advertisements and articles. Furthermore, his work also appeared in other publications including the Saturday Home Magazine and the New York Daily News. During the McCarthy era, after refusing to design a pro-McCarthy cartoon, he was fired from these publications. It was during the 1950s, a period of political uncertainty and the concurrent decline of illustration that Devlin developed a comic strip carried in local papers, the Newark Evening News and the Elizabeth Daily Journal, and syndicated in newspapers as far west as Honolulu. Moreover, Devlin began painting portraits and Victorian architecture. In a collaboration with his wife Dorothy (known as Wende), the couple produced more than two dozen children's books featuring Wende's imaginative writing accompanied by Devlin's colorful and energetic illustrations. The first of these children’s books was Old Black Witch (1963), a story, along with its two sequels, has sold almost two million copies. Harry and Wende Devlin made a comic strip Fullhouse (later retitled to Raggmopp), which ran between 1954 and 1957.https://www.lambiek.net/artists/d/devlin_harry.htm Afterwards Devlin proceeded to renew a long-standing interest in Victorian architecture where he published To Grandfather's House We Go (1967), containing illustrations after paintings he had begun as early as 1954. The clarity of the descriptions and illustrations of architecture made the work not only an educational children's book but also a source book for college courses in architectural history. Devlin published What Kind of a House Is That? shortly after, and in 1989 came his major volume on the subject, Portraits of American Architecture: Monuments to a Romantic Mood, 1830-1900. Devlin's style results from a technique very similar to contemporary photo-realism as is evident in ‘’Off the Yellow Brick Road’’ (1989). He alters slide images to define his basic composition, but incorporates \\"high truths\\" in the form of the removal of offending modern incursions such as telephone poles to infuse a sense of nostalgia and mood. Today, Devlin's works can be found in several New Jersey private, corporate, and museum collections including the Jane Voorhees Zimmerli Art Museum and the Morris Museum of Art.Mitnick, Barbara J. \\"Devlin, Harry\\", Encyclopedia of New Jersey.

The title comes from the lyrics of the song \\"My Grandfather's Clock\\", which is sung or played throughout the episode as a recurring motif. As in the song, main character Sam Forstmann (played by Ed Wynn) believes his life is tied to his clock's ticking. Opening narration Plot Sam Forstmann is an old man who spends all of his time working on his grandfather clock, upsetting his pregnant granddaughter and her husband, with whom he resides. They press him into speaking with a psychiatrist friend of theirs. Sam confides in the psychiatrist that his father bought the clock on the day he was born, and that he will die if it stops ticking. The psychiatrist thinks this belief is merely a subconscious rationalization of Sam's obsession with the clock and advises him to sell it. In an effort to appease his family, Sam puts the clock up for sale. However, when a neighbor expresses interest in it, he offers to let her have it with payment indefinitely deferred and come by every two days to maintain it. Two weeks after he sells the clock, the new owners go on vacation for the weekend, so Sam cannot wind the clock. Desperate, he tries breaking into the house, but a passing policeman is alerted by the sound of the window shattering and takes him back home. There he lies weakly in bed and resigns himself to death. The clock stops, and his \\"spirit\\" appears, informing him \\"It's time to go.\\" He chooses to stop believing in the clock's power, declaring instead that he wants to live to see his great-grandchild grow up. He, therefore, continues to live (and the \\"spirit\\" vanishes). The next morning, he tells his expectant granddaughter, \\"When that clock died, I was born again.\\" Closing narration Production notes \\"Ninety Years Without Slumbering\\" was a drastic reworking of an original script by George Clayton Johnson, \\"Tick of Time.\\" Most notably, in \\"Tick of Time\\" the main character did indeed die when the clock stopped. Johnson did not approve of the changes made to his story, and was credited onscreen under a pseudonym. This episode was Bernard Herrmann's final score for the series. References *DeVoe, Bill. (2008).

Plot introduction The year is 1943 and life is good for Jewel Hilburn, her husband, Leston, and their five children. Although there's a war going on, the Mississippi economy is booming, providing plenty of business for the hardworking family. Even the news that eldest son James has enlisted is mitigated by the fact that Jewel, now pushing 40, is pregnant with one last child. Her joy is slightly clouded, however, when her childhood friend Cathedral arrives at the door with a troubling prophecy: \\"I say unto you that the baby you be carrying be yo' hardship, be yo' test in this world. This be my prophesying unto you, Miss Jewel.\\" When the child is finally born, it seems that Cathedral's prediction was empty: the baby appears normal in every way. As the months go by, however, Jewel becomes increasingly afraid that something is wrong with little Brenda Kay—she doesn't cry, she doesn't roll over, she's hardly ever awake. Eventually husband and wife take the baby to the doctor and are informed that she is a \\"Mongolian Idiot,\\" not expected to live past the age of 2.

It was chosen as a selection for Oprah's Book Club in September 2000.  Plot summary  Amanda and Mathilda are two sisters who live in rural Wisconsin; they are very close, but very different. While Mathilda is petite, well-liked, pretty, and adventurous, Amanda is tall, clumsy, awkward, and serious. When Mathilda marries Carl, Amanda feels betrayed and leaves to go to nursing school. She dives into her work and makes her entire life about helping the sick and injured. Meanwhile, Mathilda and Carl are married and living together on a small island just away from the family farm. They are happy there, and welcome their child, Ruth, into the world. A short time later, however, Carl begins to feel trapped, enlists in the army and is sent away to France. Mathilda is devastated and angry at his departure. She moves back to the mainland and into the old house of her late parents. Amanda begins to feel agitated and upset. She's also sick all the time, and a nervous wreck. She is persuaded to take a rest, and travels back to the family farm to stay with her sister and niece. The three grow very close, and Amanda begins to see Ruth as their child, becoming very protective of her. After living in the farm house for a while, Amanda persuades Mathilda to move out to the island. At first, the idea does not go over well, but Mathilda soon agrees, and the three of them move out to the island. During the summer, it becomes apparent that Amanda is pregnant and desperate to hide it from everyone. Mathilda agrees to adopt the child as her own and make up a story about the baby being an orphan from a \\"hired girl.\\" Amanda is pleased with this arrangement, but still must hide her pregnancy, so she does not leave the island until the baby is born. When the baby finally comes, Mathilda delivers it in the house with Ruth under the bed. Sometime in the night, Amanda changes her mind about Mathilda raising the baby and tries to leave the island by walking across the ice with the child. Ruth, who is approximately four at this time, follows Amanda out onto the ice because she doesn't want her to leave. Mathilda runs out after them, trying to get Ruth back and find out why Amanda is leaving. Out on the ice, they walk over a thin patch and the ice starts to break. Ruth and Mathilda go under, while Amanda desperately tries to save them. Mathilda pushes Ruth to the surface to save her, but falls back in herself. Amanda tries desperately to pull her out, but can't do it without falling in, so Mathilda bites her sister's finger to force her to let go and leave her to drown in the freezing water. Ruth is half dead and frozen on the ice with the baby, but she is revived. Amanda takes the new baby to a woman in town who has recently had a stillborn child. She tells the woman that a hired girl had the baby and then died in childbirth. She also tells her that the baby's name is Imogene. The woman is so taken with the child, and so amazed at the situation that she doesn't notice that both Ruth and Amanda are frozen and wearing nightgowns. She also doesn't notice the blood on Amanda. Soon after Mathilda's death, Carl returns home from the war with serious injuries, and is nursed back to health by Amanda. Ruth, traumatized, is behaving oddly and very leery of her father, whom she barely knows. The three of them live together for a while without incident, but after a while, Carl starts to suspect that there might be more to the story of his wife's death than he has been told. As far as he knows, his wife wandered out into the night all alone and disappeared, later to be found under the ice. Amanda starts having serious issues again with her nerves and anxiety. She is institutionalized in a mental hospital, and Carl is left to take care of Ruth on his own. Worried that he doesn't know enough about children, he asks his cousin, Hilda, to come to the farm and care for Ruth. Ruth dislikes Hilda almost instantly. She is strict, serious, and humorless. She sees Ruth as a problem child, and seems almost to enjoy punishing her. Later on, Ruth and Imogene become friends. Development and release Christina Schwarz began working on the characters for Drowning Ruth in 1989, drawing inspiration from, what she called, a \\"Boo Radleyish\\" neighbor from her childhood, who was largely a recluse and was rumored to have shot at children who trespassed on her property. Having recently received her Masters degree from Yale University, Shwarz began teaching at a private high school. As teaching consumed more of her time, however, her husband encouraged her quit teaching and dedicate herself to her novel. She spent almost five years writing the book while working odd jobs; her husband, Benjamin Schwarz (who eventually became an Atlantic Monthly editor) financially supported them. By 1999, she was a thirty-something school teacher based in Los Angeles when she sent the first few pages of the novel accompanied by a cover letter to the Virginia Barber Agency. Jennifer Rudolph Walsh, the agent who received it, found the submission \\"irresistible\\" and asked that the rest be sent urgently. Schwartz, however, explained that she could not afford to send the entire manuscript to New York by FedEx. Deb Futter, of Doubleday also loved the book, ultimately winning the publishing rights at auction and releasing it as \\"hard-soft\\" title with Ballantine Books. At the time, Futter said the exciting thing about the book was its \\"utter obsessiveness.\\" Random House Audible, a joint effort between Random House and Audible Inc., announced that Drowning Ruth would be its launch title. The foreign rights were also sold to publishers in the U.K., Germany, France, Italy Japan, the Netherlands, Finland, Sweden and Denmark. The book reportedly found support among independent booksellers, particularly in Wisconsin, where the story is set. However, the digital-only audiobook release drew complaints from these sellers, as they spoke of being left out of the market. The book had an initial and second run of 25,000 each, and publicity director Allison Rich announced in October 2000 that an additional 750,000 copies would be sent to press. Reception Calling the work a \\"brilliantly understated psychological thriller,\\" Publisher's Weekly said that \\"Schwarz deftly uses first-person narration to heighten the drama. Her prose is spare but bewitching, and she juggles the speakers and time periods with the surety of a seasoned novelist.\\" Paul Gray with Time called her work an \\"unusually deft and assured first novel [that] conveys a good deal more than thrills and chills.\\" Reviewing it as a young adult novel, School Library Journal said the book is a \\"wonderfully constructed gothic suspense novel\\" and \\"a compelling complex tale of psychological mystery and maddeningly destructive provincial attitudes. While conceding that \\"it is not hard to see why Drowning Ruth became a bestseller in the United States,\\" Lisa Allardice with U.K. publication New Statesman called the story \\"intriguing, if predictable.\\" Commenting on the novel's \\"lyrical style, its thriller-ish mystery and its sure-handed use of a risky, multiple-narrative gambit,\\" Jerome Weeks with The Dallas Morning News says it \\"is an impressive achievement for a first novel,\\" but acknowledges that \\"unfortunately, by the last third of the story ... there are too many coincidences, too many revelations avoided for implausible lengths of time.\\" In that same vein, Diane Simon of People said that \\"if your taste runs to miraculous coincidences and primal emotions, you're in good company with Ruth.\\" The book made the Amazon' best seller list. It also spent four weeks on the New York Times's best seller lists, spending four weeks there and rating number three in for the year. The novel was chosen as a main selection of the Oprah Book Club, Literary Guild, Doubleday Book Club, Teen People and Mango Book Club. It was one of the fastest-selling downloads on Audible.com at that time. According to Publisher's Weekly, it was the twelfth best-selling work of fiction in the U.S. in 2000. It was the 13th bestselling novel on Apple iBooks for the week ending for the week ended December 31, 2017. Film Alix Taylor, the Vice President of Development at Craven/Maddalena's Dimension/Miramax at the time, brought the project to the company's attention. Miramax bought the movie rights with plans for Wes Craven to direct the project, even before the book was released. Taylor subsequently oversaw the project. In October 2000, it was announced that Marianne Maddalena would be the producer and Mark Kruger wrote the screenplay.

The events are centered on the aftermath of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima in Japan. Plot The film moves between Shizuma Shigematsu's journal entries about Hiroshima in 1945, following the dropping of the atomic bomb, and the present, 1950, when Shigematsu and his wife Shigeko are the guardians for their niece Yasuko and charged with finding her a husband (she has been declined three times due to concerns over her having been in the \\"black rain\\" fallout). As the story progresses, Shigematsu sees more and more fellow hibakusha, his friends and family, succumbing to radiation sickness and Yasuko's prospects for marriage become more and more unlikely, as she forms a bond with a poor man named Yuichi, who carves jizo and suffers a form of post-traumatic stress disorder where he attacks passing motor vehicles as \\"tanks.\\" Cast * Yoshiko Tanaka as Yasuko * as Shigematsu Shizuma * Etsuko Ichihara as Shigeko Shizuma * Shoichi Ozawa as Shokichi * Norihei Miki as Kotaro * Keisuke Ishida as Yuichi * Hisako Hara as Kin * Masato Yamada as Tatsu * Taiji Tonoyama Analysis The film has strong themes of suffering, transience and the uncertainty of the time of one's death. Aside from its compassionate treatment of the hibakusha, who were often shunned by their fellow Japanese, this film is remarkable for its terrifying re-creation of the Hiroshima atomic bombing and its immediate aftermath. Its scenes of horribly burned survivors of the explosion, their flesh seared or flayed by the heat, struggling to escape from under collapsed buildings or find cooling water in which to immerse themselves, often dying in the streams once they find them, are unforgettable.

She was a nurse by profession. Biography Catherine Coll was born in Bruree, County Limerick. She emigrated to New York City, New York, in 1879. She first took a job with a wealthy French family that was living in Manhattan. This is where she allegedly met Juan Vivion de Valera (born 1854), a Spanish sculptor who came to the home of her employers to give music lessons to the children. Though de Valera's official biography (Longford/O'Neill, Hutchinson, London, 1970) states that his parents were married at St. Patrick's in Greenville, New Jersey, on 19 September 1881, the parish records show no record of any Coll–de Valera wedding either at St Patrick's or any church, nor were any civil records found, in the vicinity during the period from 1875 to 1887. Also, initially de Valera was not registered in his father's name. The New York State records contain two de Valera birth certificates. The first, registered on 10 November 1882, gives his name as George De Valero. The second was a \\"corrected certificate\\" which was \\"approved by Commissioner of Health\\" on 30 June 1910.\\"Irish Historical Mysteries with copies of both birth certificates. For a fuller account see footnote no. 5 to the article on Éamon de Valera\\" Consequently, whilst the correction was instigated by de Valera's mother Kate, there appears to be no validity in the claims that it was for the purpose of establishing de Valera's U.S. citizenship in an attempt to save him from a firing squad following the Easter Rising in Dublin, which occurred six years later. It is in this second certificate that the first name is given as Edward and the surname as de Valera. It was alleged that Vivion de Valera, always in poor health, left his young family behind him and traveled to Colorado, hoping that perhaps the healthier air would help him out only to die within a few months. However, not merely is there no record of the wedding. No record exists of the existence of a \\"Juan Vivion de Valera\\" anywhere in the United States: no birth certificate, no baptismal certificate (if he was a Catholic), no wedding certificate and no death certificate. While it was possible that he was born abroad and so either had a foreign birth certificate or was not registered, the absence of a death certificate for someone stated definitely in Éamon de Valera's family history to have died in the United States has puzzled researchers. Some scholars have questioned whether he ever existed. Kate later married a British coachman, Charles Wheelwright, on 7 May 1888, who converted to Roman Catholicism for her, and she gave birth to a daughter Ann, and a son, Thomas, who would later become a Catholic priest. They moved to Rochester, New York. The closeness of the marriage to her supposed first husband's death is again pointed to as supporting the theory that the first marriage had never actually existed, and was just a cover story to explain her pregnancy. Coll sent her young son (later known as Éamon) back to live with his grandmother and uncle in Bruree prior to her marriage to Wheelwright. She never brought him back to live with her. Later in his life, Éamon de Valera would remember occasional visits from, as he remembered and described her, a \\"woman in black\\", who he had thought might have been his mother. The 1881 British census lists Charles Wheelwright, aged 27, a coachman/domestic servant living at the house of a man called Edward de Vall or Devall, 65, a coachman, and this coincidence has suggested a possible connection between Wheelwright and the arrival of a real or imaginary Devall in New York. The Wheelwrights were staunch supporters of de Valera and his cause for the establishment of the Irish Republic. In 1916, Mrs. Wheelwright campaigned successfully for the suspension of the death sentence imposed by a British court on her son, a US citizen by virtue of his birth on American soil. Charles Wheelwright died in 1929, and Catherine Wheelwright died on 12 June 1932. Both are buried at the Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in Rochester, New York. Although married for many years to Wheelwright, Catherine is generally referred to in biographies as Catherine (or Kate) Coll. In public records The birth of a daughter named Annie Wheelwright was registered as happening in Manhattan, New York City on 13 July 1889, the father's name being Charles Wheelwright (aged 32) and the mother's \\"Katie Kall\\" (aged 29).Annie Wheelwright at familysearch.org, accessed 30 January 2016 The 1910 U.S. Census for Rochester records Charles Wheelwright as a coachman and Kate Wheelwright as a nurse, living in the household of a Warham H.

To participate in a donor- advised fund, a donating individual or organization opens an account in the fund and deposits cash, securities, or other financial instruments. They surrender ownership of anything they put in the fund, but retain advisory privileges over how their account is invested, and how it distributes money to charities. Details A donor-advised fund is an account at a sponsoring organization, generally a public charity, where an individual can make a charitable gift to enjoy an immediate tax benefit and retain advisory privileges to disburse charitable gifts over time. The contribution a donor makes to their donor-advised fund is 100% irrevocable and destined for a final 501(c)(3) organization. Donor-advised funds provide a flexible way for donors to pass money through to charities—an alternative to direct giving or creating a private foundation. Donors enjoy administrative convenience (the sponsoring organization does the paperwork after the initial donation), cost savings (a foundation requires around 2.5% to 4% of its assets each year to run), and tax advantages (versus individual giving) by conducting their grantmaking through the fund. On average, conversion time for a contribution to a donor-advised fund to a grant from the donor-advised fund, is approximately 24 months. A donor-advised fund has some disadvantages compared to a private foundation, and some advantages. Both can accept donations of unusual or illiquid assets (e.g., part ownership of a private company, art, real estate, partnerships or limited partnership shares), but a donor-advised fund has higher deductions for these gifts (depending on the gift). In addition, the founders or board of a private foundation have complete control over where its giving goes within broad legal bounds. In a donor-advised fund, the donor only advises the sponsoring organization where the money should go. While rare (perhaps unheard of?), a sponsoring organization could conceivably ignore the donor's intent. In addition, most donor-advised funds can solely give to IRS certified 501(c)(3) organizations or their foreign equivalents. This rules out, for example, most kinds of donations to individuals, and scholarships—both things a private foundation can do more easily. As well, it precludes political donations, lobbying organizations, etc. Donor-advised funds do reap a significant cost advantage (foundations carry a 2.5-4% of assets overhead expense to maintain, a 1-2% excise tax on NET investment earnings and a required 5% spending of assets each year) but may also have one more drawback: a limited lifetime, although this varies depending on the sponsor. American Endowment Foundation for example allows successor advisors in perpetuity. While a foundation can persist for generations or in perpetuity, some sponsoring organizations impose a \\"sunset\\" on donor-advised funds, after which they collapse individual funds into their general charity pool. Because a public charity houses the fund, donors receive the maximum tax deduction available, while avoiding excise taxes and other restrictions imposed on private foundations. Further, donors avoid the cost of establishing and administering a private foundation, including staffing and legal fees. The donor receives the maximum tax deduction at the time they donate to their account, and the organization that administers the fund gains full control over the contribution, granting the donor advisory status. As such, the administrating fund is not legally bound to the donor, but makes grants to other public charities on the donor's recommendation. Most foundations that offer donor-advised funds only make grants from these funds to other public charities, and usually perform due diligence to verify the grantee's tax- exempt status. Drexel University environmental sociologist Robert Brulle, who has studied networks of nonprofit funding, described donor-advised funds: > In this type of foundation, individuals or other foundations contribute > money to the donor directed foundation, and it then makes grants based on > the stated preferences of the original contributor. This process ensures > that the intent of the contributor is met while also hiding that > contributor's identity. Because contributions to a donor directed foundation > are not required to be made public, their existence provides a way for > individuals or corporations to make anonymous contributions. Whitney Ball, co-founder and executive director of the donor-advised fund Donors Trust, described donor-advised funds: > A donor-advised fund begins with a donor contributing cash or assets to a > public charity, which in turn creates a separate account for the donor, who > may recommend disbursements from the fund to other public charities. > Technically, the charity that sponsors the fund has final say on the > disbursements, and it is legally required to ensure they go only to > charitable purposes, but in normal circumstances the original donor's > requests will be followed. Since 2010, some donor-advised funds have become less like traditional foundations. The simultaneous growth of DAFs and online giving has led to funds like CharityBox, CharityBox archived June 22, 2016 that are run by start-up companies through a web/mobile platform. Such companies allow donors to give directly to 501(c)(3) organizations and instantly receive tax- deductible receipts via email. History The New York Community Trust pioneered donor-advised funds in 1931. Though the second such fund was not created until 1935, the field has greatly expanded since, as commercial sponsors, educational institutions, and independent charities started offering the service. , donor-advised funds were the fastest growing charitable giving vehicle in the U.S.—more than 269,000 donor-advised accounts held over $78 billion in assets. Regulation Current U.S. tax law allows the donor of appreciated securities or other assets to get a tax deduction for the market value of the donation and avoid capital gains taxes. This double tax advantage can make donating appreciated assets to a charitable organization more attractive than selling the assets and donating cash. By donating appreciated assets to a donor-advised fund and then advising the fund to make donations to several charities, one can reap these tax advantages without the hassle and paperwork of transferring non-cash assets to several organizations. This combination of convenience and full tax advantage is one reason that donor- advised funds are used. While private foundations in the United States are heavily regulated by the Internal Revenue Service, including rules on oversight and minimum annual payouts, donor-advised funds housed in public charities are not subject to the same tax restrictions. In 1985, National Foundation, Inc. (NFI, now WaterStone), defended its standard for the management of donor-advised funds against the Internal Revenue Service in the United States tax court in National Foundation, Inc. v. United States. The court found that NFI was eligible for tax-exemption and could be classified as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization based on their management of donor-advised funds. NFI had complete control and ownership of what would later be called donor-advised funds, and could exercise discretion in authorizing charitable distributions of the funds. Donors maintained advisory privileges, but NFI was not obligated to use the funds based on their recommendations, especially if the receiving party did not comply with the five standards of a charitable organization, identified by the court: 1) that it be consistent with the charitable purposes specified in section 501(c)(3); (2) that it have a reasonable budget; (3) that it be adequately funded; (4) that it be staffed by competent and well trained personnel; and (5) that it be capable of effective monitoring and supervision by NFI. The outcome of this case opened the door for many other providers to launch donor-advised fund programs. On August 17, 2006, President George W. Bush signed the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (H.R. 4) into law, which includes a number of changes to the regulatory framework for donor-advised funds. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 established guidelines for the management of donor-advised funds, using NFI's standards as a framework. The sections dealing with donor-advised funds include: * Legal definition of a donor-advised fund. * A list of prohibited payments to donors and advisers to donor-advised fund. * New rules about what grants can be made from donor-advised funds. * The documentation required for all contributions to donor-advised funds. Tax efficiency example The following example is taken from Vanguard's marketing material for their plan: Suppose you have 1,000 shares of stock that you purchased 15 years ago (thus, you're in long term capital gains territory). Assume that you purchased the stock for $10 per share and it is now worth $100 per share. Now, let's compare the cost to the donor of making a contribution of $100,000 to a charity of your choice. We assume a 35% income tax rate and 15% long term capital gains tax rate. Option 1: Contribute cash from sale of securities * Immediate cost of donation: $100,000 * Capital gains tax incurred: $13,500 (15% times ($100k minus $10k)) * Net income tax saving: ($21,500) (35% times $100k deduction, minus the capital gains amount) Charity receives $100,000 for a net cost to donor of $78,500 Option 2: Contribute appreciated securities * Immediate cost of donation: $100,000 * Income tax saved: ($35,000) (35% times $100k) Charity receives $100,000 for a net cost to donor of $65,000 Thus, by donating appreciated securities rather than selling them, one can contribute the same total amount with reduced effective donor cost. This is true whether or not one uses a donor-advised fund. If the securities increase in value after they have been given to the donor-advised fund (but before the grant recommendation is actually made), no additional tax deduction can be claimed by the taxpayer. On the other hand, if the securities decrease in value, the taxpayer's original tax deduction (based on the value of the securities when given to the donor-advised fund) remains valid. Even though the tax efficiency is the same, there are differences between giving directly to a charity and giving via a donor-advised fund. * Some charities are not set up to receive gifts of securities. * The amount that the donor wants to give to the charity may be an awkward or small number of shares (for example, it could be administratively complicated to give five shares each to 20 charities, but it is easy to give 100 shares to the donor-advised fund and then make 20 separate grant recommendations). * Giving to a donor-advised fund lets the donor take the tax deduction when it is advantageous. For example, a taxpayer can get a tax deduction for a contribution to a donor-advised fund and decide later which charities are the ultimate beneficiaries. * Some donor-advised funds process gifts to foreign charities. Direct gifts to foreign charities by individuals are generally not tax deductible. However, there is a cost to donor-advised funds. Most donor-advised funds charge an administrative fee (e.g., 1% per year). This is in addition to management fees that, for example, any mutual funds the donor fund is invested in. * The donor-fund administrator may also charge fees for every grant, especially if to a foreign charity.

Plot introduction Harley Altmyer, a nineteen-year-old, has to care for his three sisters as his mother is in jail for killing his abusive father. Living in the coal town of Laurel Falls in backwoods Western Pennsylvania, he lusts after a mother of two who lives down the lane. Plot summary Harley Altmyer should be in college drinking beer and chasing girls. He should be freed from his stifling coal town with its lack of jobs and no sense of humor. Instead he's marooned in the Pennsylvania backwoods caring for his three younger sisters after the shooting death of his physically abusive father and the arrest of his mother. Life is further complicated when he develops an obsession with the sexy, melancholic mother of two down the road. Family secrets and unspoken truths threaten to consume him as his obsession deepens and she responds unearthing a series of staggering surprises. In the face of each unexpected revelation and through every wrenching ordeal, Harley does the best he can to hold it all together. Violent and disturbing yet touching and darkly funny, Harley's story is ultimately a search for his own self-worth as he slowly comes to realize that survival is a talent. Film adaptation In 2011, it was announced that a film adaptation of the book would be directed by Adrian Lyne. However, the film never made it into production. In late 2015, it was announced that Alex Pettyfer and his producing partner Craig Robinson who setup Upturn Productions in 2015 with the intent of securing literary works that could be made into film or television, secured the rights for a film adaptation of the book. The film, Back Roads went into production in March 2017, with Pettyfer also serving as its director. The film stars Pettyfer as Harley Altmyer, Jennifer Morrison as Callie Mercer, Juliette Lewis as Bonnie Altmyer, Nicola Peltz as Amber Altmyer, and Robert Patrick as Chief Mansour.

Since 1997 MDX has operated and maintained five expressways formerly operated by the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT): * Gratigny Parkway (SR 924) * Airport Expressway (SR 112) * Dolphin Expressway (SR 836) * Don Shula Expressway (SR 874) * Snapper Creek Expressway (SR 878) All five expressways are all electronic toll roads, requiring the use of SunPass or a \\"toll-by- plate\\" program and do not accept cash, and the free movement sections were removed. The Gratigny Parkway, Don Shula Expressway, and Snapper Creek Expressway became all electronic in 2010, while the Airport Expressway and Dolphin Expressway were converted 2014.Garvin, Glenn. \\"Miami-Dade’s 836, 112 expressways to close at night to install toll equipment\\". Miami Herald 25 July 2014. Retrieved 20 August 2014 Completely funded by toll revenues, MDX has been aggressively upgrading and updating its roads over the past decade, including the ongoing Dolphin Expressway extension (the first phase was completed in 2007) and re-engineering of several interchanges of its two oldest expressways (the Airport and Dolphin). Long-term plans include the redesign and reconstruction of longtime bottlenecks in the Shula and Dolphin Expressways, most notably the often-backed-up Killian Parkway/SR 990 interchange near Miami Dade College-Kendall Campus and the heavily congested interchange with the Palmetto Expressway (SR 826) near the extreme southwestern end of Miami International Airport.  Markings  All MDX highways use the shield-shaped signs reserved by FDOT for toll roads, with the MDX logo (see above) attached below the \\"shield\\". In addition, all MDX highways use a uniquely designed mileage marker. Instead of the green \\"MILE XX\\" markers commonly seen on interstate highways, the five MDX expressways use blue mileage markers featuring (from top to bottom, in white): a single letter indicating the direction of travel, the State Road designation of the highway (complete with outline of the State of Florida), and two numbers separated by a horizontal line (\\"2\\" on the top, \\"4\\" on the bottom of the line represents Mile Marker 2.4 from either the southern or western end of the expressway). These markers are placed on the edge of the shoulder every 0.2 miles along the expressway. The Gratigny Parkway has two of these (Mile Markers 5.0 and 5.2) on a surface street near Opa-locka on Northwest 119th Street just east of the end of its easternmost ramp). Prior to the removal of free movement sections, on portions of a MDX route where no tolls are ahead, the TOLL in the green section of the TOLL shield was removed. Airport Expressway State Road 112, locally known as Airport Expressway is a 4-mile-long east–west expressway connecting Miami International Airport in Miami to I‑95 and I-195, which ultimately connects to Miami Beach. Dolphin Expressway State Road 836, locally known as the Dolphin Expressway, is a 13.8-mile-long toll road currently extending from Southwest 137th Avenue in the west to I-95 in the east. The section of roadway east of I-95 is designated as I-395 or the MacArthur Causeway. Don Shula Expressway State Road 874, locally known as the Don Shula Expressway, is 7 miles long, connecting the Homestead Extension of Florida's Turnpike and Palmetto Expressway in central Miami-Dade County, Florida. As of July 17, 2010, the Don Shula Expressway no longer accepts cash. Snapper Creek Expressway State Road 878, locally known as the Snapper Creek Expressway, stretches for 3 miles between Don Shula Expressway (State Road 874) and U.S. Highway 1 (South Dixie Highway - SR 5). This provides access to Kendall and South Miami. Although constructed, improved and maintained through toll revenue, the Snapper Creek Expressway was untolled until July 17, 2010, when open road tolling (ORT) was initiated on the Expressway. Gratigny Parkway State Road 924, locally known as Gratigny Parkway, is a 5.2-mile-long limited access all-electronic toll road maintained by the Miami-Dade Expressway, running east to west. The Gratigny Parkway starts east of the Palmetto Expressway/I-75 interchange in Hialeah and ends at Northwest 32nd Avenue in North Miami. The section of roadway east of NW 32nd Avenue is a surface street (Northwest 119th Street) also known as Gratigny Road. Despite its relatively short length, SR 924 is a major east–west artery in northern Miami-Dade County, Florida.

The album is the follow up to his highly successful debut album Hellbilly Deluxe, released in 1998. The album was released by Geffen Records on November 13, 2001, more than three years after the release of his first album. The album's title is named after the 1961 crime drama film The Sinister Urge, directed and written by Ed Wood. Much like his previous effort, The Sinister Urge features elements of horror film and suspense in both its lyrical content and its music. Zombie also features a change of sound in several songs on the album when compared to Hellbilly, with songs such as \\"Never Gonna Stop (The Red, Red Kroovy)\\" featuring a more dance-influenced beat. The album only spawned one commercial single, \\"Demon Speeding\\", which was released in June 2002. The song was a hit on the Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in the United States, becoming Zombie's third Top 20 hit on the chart. Several songs from the album were released as promotional singles both before and after the album's release. The song \\"Scum of the Earth\\" was featured on the Mission: Impossible 2 soundtrack, while \\"Never Gonna Stop (The Red, Red Kroovy)\\", \\"Feel So Numb\\" and \\"Dead Girl Superstar\\" were released as promotional singles throughout 2001 and 2002. The album itself was a commercial success, becoming Zombie's second consecutive studio album to enter inside the Top 10 of the Billboard 200. The album went on to receive a Platinum certification from the RIAA, for shipments exceeding one million copies. The Sinister Urge received mixed to positive critical reviews, but has become a fan favorite. Songs from the album were used in numerous television series and films, similar to the success of Zombie's previous album. Songs from the album have been covered by numerous artists, with some of these covers appearing on the 2002 tribute album The Electro-Industrial Tribute to Rob Zombie. To date, The Sinister Urge has sold nearly two million copies worldwide, and was his second RIAA-certified album. The Sinister Urge is one of three Rob Zombie albums to reach Platinum status, along with Hellbilly Deluxe and the 2003 compilation album Past, Present & Future. It is the final album to include guitarist Mike Riggs and drummer John Tempesta, who had been part of the Rob Zombie band line-up since 1998. Background & development On The Sinister Urge, Zombie worked with numerous writers and producers from his previous album, Hellbilly Deluxe. Scott Humphrey returned to produce the album, while former White Zombie band member John Tempesta returned to play drums for the album. On the concept behind the album, Zombie stated \\"I didn't really have a theme, I used to think that way but now I try not to have a preconceived idea because then you sort of box yourself into a corner and then everything doesn’t fit. You actually end up throwing away better songs because you think it has to be a certain way.\\" Zombie worked with music legend and Black Sabbath singer Ozzy Osbourne on the song \\"Iron Head\\", featured as the fifth track on the album. On the collaboration, Zombie stated \\"I thought that somehow the song didn't seem special enough. Somehow I thought that the song wasn’t as good as it should be and I had been talking to Ozzy a lot and working on stuff for the tour and someone was like, 'Why don't you just get Ozzy to fucking do it?' It was like, duh. Sometimes you don' think of the obvious ideas.\\" Kerry King of thrash metal band Slayer provides a guitar solo for the song \\"Dead Girl Superstar\\". Composition Zombie stated that his previous album, Hellbilly Deluxe, featured a lot of electronics, whereas The Sinister Urge features a live band, meaning more emphasis on the instrumentals. \\"Never Gonna Stop (The Red, Red Kroovy)\\" is said to \\"showcase handclaps and acoustic guitars\\". The song's video is inspired by the film A Clockwork Orange. Release & artwork The Sinister Urge was released on November 13, 2001 via Geffen Records.

Plot summary In Chile during the 1840s, young Chilean Eliza Sommers is raised and educated by English Anglican siblings Rose, Jeremy, and John Sommers. The Victorian-Spinster Rose, strict Jeremy, and sailor John live in the port of Valparaiso after discovering Eliza on their doorstep. Eliza is taught about the art of cooking by the Mapuche Indian, Mama Fresia. Over most of Part I, Eliza's origins and upbringing, and her maturity are told. Eliza falls in love with Joaquin Andieta, a young Chilean man who is concerned about his mother who is living in poverty. The young couple have an affair, ultimately resulting in Eliza getting pregnant. Soon, news of gold being discovered in California reaches Chile, and Joaquin goes out to California in search of a fortune. Wanting to follow her lover, Eliza goes to California, with the help of Chinese zhong yi (physician), Tao Chi'en, who later becomes her friend, in the bowels of a ship headed by a Dutch Lutheran captain, Vincent Katz. In the beginning of Part II, Tao's past is revealed, from his early life in poverty, to his apprenticeship to a master acupuncturist, and his ill-fated marriage to Lin, a young and pretty, but frail girl who dies after a brief marriage. Lin's spirit later comes in to help her widowed husband at crucial points for Tao in later parts of the book. During the journey to California, Eliza, due to her pregnancy, is frail and sick, and later suffers a miscarriage. To leave the ship without suspicion, Tao disguises Eliza as a Chinese boy, a disguise that she maintains in San Francisco where they have landed. Eliza earns money by selling some Chilean snacks and Tao becomes a successful zhong yi. Tao, after seeing the greed and brothels in San Francisco, loses most of his faith in America. Eliza sets on her journey to find Joaquin, using a male cowboy's disguise and the moniker Elias Andieta, and claiming to be Joaquin's brother. Meanwhile, in Valparaiso, Rose and Jeremy are shocked to find that Eliza has disappeared. When John comes and asks about her whereabouts, Rose reveals a well-kept, shocking secret to Jeremy, a secret that she and John have concealed from him since Eliza's arrival into their home: John is Eliza's father, having had her with an unnamed Chilean woman. Based on intuition, John Sommers sails for San Francisco, commissioned by his wealthy employer Paulina Rodriguez de Santa Cruz as a steam ship captain, with the additional intent of finding his daughter. Part III finds Eliza broke after still trying to search for Joaquin; she occasionally sends letters to Tao describing what she sees in her journey. Although she has fallen out of love with Joaquin, she cannot stop journeying. In an outskirt town, Eliza meets up with Joe Bonecrusher's travelling caravan of prostitutes and ends up travelling with them as cook and piano player. The members of the caravan believe Eliza to be a homosexual man, a disguise which she takes up much to the frustration of Babalu, the caravan's bodyguard. Eliza stays with the group during the winter as they settle in a small town. During this time, Tao moves to San Francisco to save up money to move back to China. He surprises himself when he realises that he misses Eliza's company and is consoled when he begins receiving her letters. John Sommers, in his search for Eliza, comes across Jacob Todd, an old suitor of Rose's who is now a journalist known as Jacob Freemont. Freemont promises that he will look out for any sign of Eliza as he writes articles about the famous bandit Joaquin Murieta, whose description matches Eliza's lover. Meanwhile, as Joe Bonecrusher's business begins to dwindle, Tao finds Eliza and returns to San Francisco with her. They set up a network to help young Chinese prostitutes to escape and rehabilitate with the help of friends. Eventually Jacob Freemont is able to pass word to the Sommers that Eliza, who was previously thought to be dead, is alive. Tao and Eliza live together and eventually form a relationship; she eventually decides to write to Rose to inform her foster mother that she is alive. When Joaquin Murieta is shot dead and his preserved head is showcased in San Francisco, Eliza goes to see if the man was really Joaquin Andieta. Main characters ;Eliza Sommers: Eliza Sommers is a headstrong, half Chilean, half English girl abandoned at birth at the home of the Sommers. She is adopted and raised in part by Rose Sommers and also by Mama Fresia, the Sommers' servant and cook. She has an excellent sense of smell and a very detailed and accurate memory. She is the daughter of John Sommers, and only after she disappears to California do Rose and John tell Jeremy about this. Her mother is unknown, and believed to be a prostitute. She was recognized as John's daughter because of the jacket wrapped around her, which was the one he used to cover up the prostitute with months before. ;Rose Sommers: Incredibly beautiful, Rose Sommers never married after an affair at a young age with an opera singer ended. She has raised Eliza as her own; although she did not wish to marry, she wanted children. She is a charming and vivacious woman, and capricious towards raising Eliza, though she does love and care for her in the way she thinks is best. ;Jeremy Sommers: Jeremy is the oldest of the Sommers. He is solid and stern, taking care to never show emotion. Jeremy and Rose live together under unspoken conditions where she takes care of the house and he provides necessities. Despite his stoic and stubborn nature, he will concede to Rose under enough duress. ;John Sommers: John is a captain of a ship and later a steamboat carrying supplies to California. He is a free spirit and the \\"loosest\\" of the Sommers, enjoying good drinks and women. He travels to many places and brings back gifts for Rose and for Eliza after she is born. ;Mama Fresia: Mama Fresia is the Mapuche cook for the Sommers. No one pays much attention to her except for Eliza who benefits from her cooking skills as well as superstitions. Eventually Mama Fresia helps Eliza run away and then disappears herself. ;Tao Chi'en: Tao Chi'en is a shanghaied zhong yi (physician) working as a cook on John Sommers' ship. Tao Chi'en cares for Eliza when she is found hidden and suffering from a miscarriage on the ship on which he is working. Once he has been dismissed from the captain's duty, Eliza comes to him to ask for him to help her follow her lover Joaquin Andieta to California. The two remain friends for life. ;Joaquin Andieta: Joaquin is a young man who works for Jeremy Sommers, though is not known to him by name. He spends time with Jacob Todd talking about philosophy and freedom. He is a loyal and hard worker, trying his best to bring his mother into a better life. Joaquin meets Eliza when delivering something to the Sommers' house. They meet multiple times to talk, which leads to an affair. When Joaquin is struck by gold fever, he steals money and heads for California, but promises to return to ask to marry Eliza and to help his mother in moving her to a home where she can recuperate. ;Jacob Todd/Freemont: Jacob is brought to Chile by a bet that he could not sell a specific number of Bibles in three months. Once he arrives he is distracted by the resisting Rose Sommers and lives off of money the local church gives him for his \\"mission work\\". Once he is unveiled as a fraud, Jacob takes off with what is left of his reputation. He ends up in California working as a journalist, though no more honest, and becomes famous for his pieces, especially those on the elusive bandit Joaquin Murieta. ;Paulina Rodriguez de Santa Cruz y del Valle: The wife of a Chilean millionaire, Feliciano Rodriguez de Santa Cruz; because of Feliciano's lower status, her father Agustin de Valle was against their relationship and only through the discreet intervention of the couple's friend, Jacob Todd, were they able to marry and become wealthy. However, their continued success is due to Paulina's sharp business intuition, which her husband, though proud and headstrong, accepts as she has never been wrong. She becomes the owner of several steamships carrying fresh produce from Chile packed in glacial ice to California and employs John Sommers to captain the ship. ;Joe Bonecrusher: The madam of the travelling brothel, who employs Eliza as a piano player and cook for her group, who all believe that Eliza is an effeminate homosexual man. Joe is tough and fearless, able to inspire respect from her girls, their bodyguard Babalu the Bad, and Joe's ward, Tom No-Tribe, and eventually townsfolk who disapprove of the brothel but are indebted to Joe because she has accepted and taken care of the sick. ;Joaquin Murieta: A legendary vigilante whose infamy circulates throughout California. Eliza is never certain if he is Joaquin Andieta, but follows his deeds in her pursuit to find her lover.

It was originally housed at The Old Vic Theatre and then Her Majesty's Theatre, before moving to premises on Borough Road where it currently operates. In 2015 the school was based at Price Studios in Clapham but later returned to Borough Road following a full building refurbishment in the summer of 2016. London School of Musical Theatre provides a one-year, full-time, vocational training course for those wishing to enter a career in Musical Theatre. The ethos of LSMT is to create the environment of a professional company in rehearsal rather than that of an educational institution.

Classes are taught by professionals and practitioners working in the industry, with direct experience of the up to the minute requirements of musical theatre. Visiting practitioners include Philip Quast, Cynthia Erivo, Aaron Tveit, Matt Ryan, Ken Caswell, Helen Hobson, Sarah Travis and Hannah Waddingham.

The novel was chosen as an Oprah's Book Club selection in March 2001. Plot  The story focuses on a grown-up Icy Sparks recounting her childhood and adolescence struggling with accusations of Tourette's Syndrome. The novel begins with Icy Sparks, a 10-year-old girl living in a mountainous region of Eastern Kentucky with her grandparents throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Icy is alienated by her peers and often shunned and pitied by the adults in her town. One day Icy suddenly begins to experience tics, croaks, and physical spasms. Soon after these seemingly uncontrollable \\"secrets\\" begin, Icy goes down into her grandparents' root cellar to let out her tics, in an effort to hide the condition from her grandparents. Finally, Icy tells one of her few friends, Miss Emily Tanner, a local store owner who is also an outcast from society at 300 pounds. Icy's elementary school teacher tries putting her in a solitary classroom, but even that doesn't work. Her grandparents have Icy admitted to a mental institution for observation. Even in the institution, Icy is an outcast. Though she sees herself as less mentally ill in comparison to some of her peers there, she is nonetheless tormented by one of the hospital workers. Icy is able to befriend a second worker, though she really just wants to go home to her grandparents. When she is finally allowed to leave, she stays in her house or on the surrounding property and does not venture out in public very often. After Icy returns home, the atmosphere is tense. After her grandfather dies, Icy and her grandmother turn to religion for solace. Inspired by a tent-meeting revival where she observes that people touched by the Holy Spirit behave as if they have Tourette's Syndrome, Icy discovers she has a gift for music. Icy proceeds to attend university, where her disorder is officially diagnosed. Later, Icy becomes a therapist, working with children with Tourette's Syndrome and with kids that experience selective mutism. Awards and nominations Icy Sparks was chosen as an Oprah's Book Club Selection in March 2001. Writing for the New York Times, Tara Bayton asserts that, \\"Rubio is a writer of uncommonly warm and tender vision, often comic, brimming with love and hope\\" and that Icy Sparks \\"at the conclusion the plot loses much-needed momentum and Icy loses much of her dramatic interest as her religious fervor increases, Rubio tells an entertaining and absorbing story\\".

Lay apostolate organizations operate under the general oversight of pastors and bishops, but need not be dependent upon them for direction. . The laity can exercise a fruitful apostolate by their conduct in the areas of their labor, profession, studies, neighborhood, and social life. And according to the Vatican II Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, they will look for opportunities to announce Christ to their neighbors through the spoken word as well (AA 13).Dulles SJ, Avery. Evangelization for the Third Millennium (Kindle Locations 257-260). Paulist Press.  From Vatican II to Pope Francis  The Second Vatican Council of bishops in the Catholic Church has been seen as elevating the laity “from passive spectators to involved members”. It was the first council in church history to specifically address the place of the laity in the life of the church. Before the Council, the laity were purely passive spectators at Mass (in Latin) and this passivity also characterized their approach to the apostolate. Exceptions were charitable organizations like St. Vincent de Paul Societies and the Knights of Columbus. But the task of teaching the faith was entrusted almost entirely to priests and religious sisters. Pope Paul VI established the Pontifical Council for the Laity in the period after Vatican II. Since the Council lay Catholics have exercised leadership in many apostolates, such as organizing charitable works and advocacy groups on behalf of the poor and oppressed. With a declining number of priests and sisters, lay persons have also undertaken the responsibility for religious education and fill more and more administrative positions at Catholic schools. The Council also specified that parents are the primary religious educators of their children. And It taught that “the secular employment of laypeople, far from being a distraction from their Christian vocation, was their primary way to sanctify, not only themselves but society.” In 2013, Francis Cardinal Arinze explained that lay persons \\"...are called by Baptism to witness to Christ in the secular sphere of life; that is in the family, in work and leisure, in science and cultural, in politics and government, in trade and mass media, and in national and international relations.\\" Arinze noted that there are many things individuals may accomplish for Christ quietly without belonging to a particular association. In other instances, organizations are more efficient to address challenges beyond the capacity of one person.Francis Cardinal Arinze, The Layperson's Distinctive Role, Ignatius Press, 2013  Pope Francis calls for missionary disciples  Pope Francis has continually criticized clericalism and emphasized that all are \\"one, holy People of God\\".Elise Harris, \\"Pope’s visit to Jesuits highlights society friends old and new,\\" Crux, 10 July 2019, https://cruxnow.com/vatican/2019/07/10/popes-visit-to-jesuits-highlights- society-friends-old-and-new/ . He emphasizes that the \\"hour of the laity\\" has arrived and decries clericalism as rife in the Church, saying that it \\"leads to the functionalization of the laity, treating them as 'messengers'.\\" In November 2019, Pope Francis addressed the new Dicastery for the Laity, Family, and Life during its first plenary assembly which had the topic, “The Lay Faithful, Identity and Mission in the World”. He urged them to use their talents as “missionary disciples” to address the various challenges of the whole Church and world, to be \\"visible signs\\" of the presence of Christ in every environment. He warned against “clericalizing the laity”: \\"Move the deacons away from the altar. …They are the custodians of service, not first- class altar boys or second-class priests.” In his first Apostolic Exhortation as Pope he had entitled a section \\"We are all missionary disciples\\" and he returned to the term seven times in that exhortation. He has also pointed out that “In truth, the laity who have an authentic Christian formation do not have need of a 'bishop-pilot' or a 'monsignor-pilot', or of clerical input to assume their proper responsibilities, on all levels: from the political to the social, from the economic to the legislative!\\" He called rather for bishops to be encouraging toward lay apostolates, good shepherds.

It won the Hemingway Foundation/PEN Award for a best first novel in 1988 and was the Oprah's Book Club selection for November 1996. Plot summary An awkward midwest girl, Ruth, is growing up in the small town of Honey Creek, Illinois. Her father, Elmer, left her family when she was ten, which left her mother, May, very bitter. May is extremely unhappy with and disappointed in Ruth because she is nothing like her shining brother, Matt, who is a mathematical genius with a scholarship to MIT, while Ruth is considered remedial. Their mother May is crushed when Matt moves away to Boston after graduation and she is left with Ruth, who takes a job with her at the local dry cleaner shop. Ruth's one confidant is her mother's sister, and Aunt, who is worldly and kind, and recognizes that Ruth is a sensitive observant young woman trapped in the circumstances of her economic and social status. The Aunt continues a relationship with both Ruth and Matt over the years, and provides Ruth with a glimpse into what life could be like as an independent middle class woman. One hot night at the local lake, Ruth meets Ruby Dahl, a local male ne'er do well. When Ruby later takes Ruth out on a date, he takes advantage of her naiveté, but Ruth continues to see him and after several dates they decide to get married. Ruby moves in with Ruth and May, and May's oppression and Ruby's stubborn laziness frequently come to a head, causing frequent tension at home. Ruth's life is bleak and somber, and even the birth of her son fails to bring the joys Ruth expected. Seasonally, winter brings on bitter cold, both in the weather and in the emotional standoffs in the Grey Dahl house. Ruby, who has descended into alcoholism and frequent drug use, begins acting more erratically. At one point, Ruth takes a short holiday to visit her Aunt. When she comes back, May has made a chicken dinner and keeps making odd comments about how tasty the chicken is because it was slaughtered properly. Ruby is silent during the meal and appears to be high. When Ruth finally asks her mother why she keeps talking about the chicken, her mother explodes with the story that Ruby strangled and hung the chicken in the coup for May to find. This disturbing story, without motive or reason, becomes a prediction for the tragedy to come. The final standoff occurs one night after dinner, and Ruby and the son want to eat some cookies. Because the family is so poor, in the months leading to Christmas, May saves up to buy flour, butter, eggs, and sugar to make Christmas donation cookies for the church. She makes them throughout the year and freezes them so that when Christmas comes, she can take them to the church and disguise their obvious poverty with generous cookie donations. Ruby and the son go to the freeze and plunder the stash in an open revolt against May. May gets very angry, and Ruby snaps. He grabs a fire poker, and begins to beat the family with it. He ends up hitting May with the fire poker over and over in the neck, killing her. He almost ends up killing Ruth until Ruth sputters that they have a son together. The mention of the son seems to snap him out of the homicidal rage, and he stops. Ruth has severe injuries, but May is dead. Ruby is imprisoned, and Ruth and the son go to live with the Aunt. The book ends with Ruth starting to attend college, no longer considered remedial after getting out from under her mother's oppressive ignorance, and she mourns the loss of her simple life and connection with Ruby while also looking forward to a different future with her son. Reception Publishers Weekly finds this first novel to be a challenge too great for Hamilton's talents. While many of the pieces are there, problems include incomplete characterizations and plotting. Kirkus Reviews provides a similar assessment: \\"Hamilton's writing is strong and clear, even if her intentions are a trifle obscure... this is an affecting first novel, dark and knowing.\\" References Category:1988 American novels Category:1988 debut novels Category:Novels set in Illinois Category:Hemingway Foundation/PEN Award-winning works ","title":"The Book of Ruth (novel)"},{"id":"3608782","text":"\\"First Love\\" was a song written by Rupert Jarvis, Robert Dylan Thomas, Orlando Weeks, Hugo White, Felix White and was the third release by British indie band The Maccabees, in November 2006.

Career Holden played on the Yale University tennis team, a tennis powerhouse in those years along with Harvard, Princeton and the University of Pennsylvania. In 1910, at the age of 20, Holden won the National Intercollegiate title for Yale, defeating R. Thayer of Pennsylvania in the first round, Cullen Thomas of Princeton in the second, S. F. Raleigh of Princeton in semis and Arthur Sweetser of Harvard in the final. All matches were best of five, and Holden lost one set during the entire tournament. Holden was a member of the Yale class of 1911.Yale Banner and Pot Pourri, Class of 1911, New Haven, CT, pg. 115. Ironically, the week before the NCAA singles final, Sweetser reached the doubles final at the international tournament in Holden's hometown: the tournament now known as the Cincinnati Masters. Holden reached six doubles finals in Cincinnati, winning two titles—in 1912 and then again 10 years later in 1922. His last doubles final came in 1932, when Holden was the remarkable age of 42. He also had success when he found himself alone on the court. He was a singles finalist in Cincinnati in the all-comers round in 1912, and reached four singles semifinals: 1908, 1910, 1912, and 1913. He lost the 1913 semifinal to William McEllroy, the eventual champion. Holden married Grace Bushnell Morgan (born January 22, 1891 in Cincinnati) and had two sons, John Morgan Holden (1922-1995) and Reuben Andrus Holden IV (1918-1995). In 1934, just two years after he reached his last doubles final in Cincinnati, tragedy struck the Holden home. The holiday liner SS Morro Castle, bound for home after a trip to Havana with 549 passengers and crew aboard, was engulfed in flames while off the coast of New Jersey.

Biography Lamy was ordained a priest in 1853 after completing his studies at Floreffe and at the seminary of Namur, he entered the Catholic University of Leuven and received from his professors, Ian Theodor Beelen, the distinguished exegete and orientalist, and Lefebre, who was well versed in positive theology, his impulse towards Biblical, Oriental, and patristic studies. He obtained the degree of Doctor of Theology in 1859. Lamy's career as professor at Leuven began in 1858 and continued uninterrupted till the year 1900, comprising courses in Hebrew, Syriac, introduction to Sacred Scripture, and exegesis. Lamy succeeded Beelen on the latter's retirement in 1875. Lamy's writings, too voluminous for enumeration here, are listed in the bibliography of the university down to 1905, under one hundred and fifty-eight entries. His most valuable contributions to learning took the form of editions of many previously unpublished Syriac writings, notably his collection in six volumes of St. Ephraem's hymns and discourses, under the title \\"Sancti Ephraemi Syri Hymni et Sermones\\", and his edition of the \\"Chronicon Ecclesiasticum\\" of Bar Hebraeus. His editions of text are marred by numerous errors, chiefly typographical. Lamy is most widely known by his \\"Introductio in Sacram Scripturam\\", in 2 volumes, which ran to six editions, an erudite collection of materials valuable in their day. Of his commentaries the most noted are his Latin commentary on Genesis, in 2 vols. (2nd ed., 1883–84), and his French commentary on the Apocalypse (1893–1894). Neither in his introduction nor in his commentaries did Lamy grapple with the difficulties of the day; his ideas, acquired in the sixth decade of the nineteenth century, remained unmodified till the end. His \\"Introduction\\" passed almost unchanged through six editions. Lamy's numerous articles show his great devotion to the Church, to his university, and to his country, as well as a marked predilection for Biblical and patristic studies. Before his death, which occurred at the age of eighty, Lamy was engaged in the revision and annotation of a French translation of the Bible. Besides his professorial labors, he served his university for thirty years as president of the College Marie Thérèse. Lamy received many honors from learned societies and from his country; he was made domestic prelate (1885) by Leo XIII, and member of the Biblical Commission (1903) by Pius X.

Copella is a British fruit juice company located south of Boxford, Suffolk. It was founded in the 1969. Copella juices are made from 100% pure pressed apples. The brand is now owned by Tropicana (part of PepsiCo Beverages and Foods North America). In 1991 the family bought the company back from Taunton Cider Company. History Copella's name and success stems from the late Devora Peake, who died in 1999. Devora was the daughter of Russian parents living in Tel Aviv. After finishing University there she set up home in the heart of the Suffolk countryside in the 1930s, and with her first husband Bernard Loshak started a farm handling and selling soft fruits, which she continued with her second husband, Bill Peake. After 30 years the family bought a fruit press, and began producing juice, introducing their first beverage, fresh apple juice, which was not made from concentrate and contained no added water - the family named it Copella. The name Copella comes from the first letters of Cox's Orange Pippins, one of the main varieties of apples used in the juice, and the last part of Devora Peake's youngest daughter's name - CarmELLA. Originally the juice was sold as a premium healthy drink in green glass bottles through delicatessens and health food shops. Over the years the business grew steadily with Copella launching its own chilled range of 100% pure pressed apple juice and apple juice blends in 1994. It was also made available in clear plastic bottles, and a new logo was introduced. Company The company was bought by Tropicana in 1998, which was in turn acquired by PepsiCo in 1999.

Her father was the 1st Marquess of Powis, and on 2 March 1699 she married the 5th Earl of Nithsdale, a Catholic nobleman. The couple had met at the French court, where Lady Winifred's father was in exile, while Nithsdale was paying his respects to the former King James II of England (James VII of Scotland). While resident at Terregles, Dumfriesshire, Scotland, the couple had five children. In 1715, Nithsdale joined the Jacobite rebellion, but he was captured at the Battle of Preston and sent to the Tower of London. Having been tried for treason, he was sentenced to death. Winifred, who was at Terregles when she heard of the capture of her husband, followed him to London, making part of the journey on horseback in bitter winter weather. She presented a petition to George I which he refused to receive, and when she knelt before him and took hold of his coat he dragged her half across the room before he could break away. Knowing that there would be no pardon, the countess laid a meticulous plan to rescue her husband from the Tower of London. The night before the day appointed for William's execution (24 February 1716), with the help of two other Jacobite ladies, Winifred effected his escape from the Tower. She had been admitted to his room, and by exchanging clothes with her maid (including the \\"Nithsdale Cloak\\", which is still held by the family), he escaped the attention of his guards. He fled to France, while the countess returned to Scotland to ensure the transfer of the estate to their son. She joined him in to France, and they went from there to Rome in the retinue of the Old Pretender. In Rome, she survived her husband by about five years.

A member of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (Ontario Section), also known as the Ontario CCF, Luckock was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1943 Ontario general election representing Toronto's Bracondale constituency (riding). She served as a Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) until she was defeated in the 1945 Ontario general election. She became the Congress of Canadian Women's founding president in 1950, and became a victim of the Cold War's anti-communist hysteria when she was denied entry into the United States, because she travelled to \\"Red\\" China and invited Soviet women to visit Canada. She contracted Parkinson's disease in the mid-1950s and mostly was bedridden until her death in 1972. Background and early life Luckock was raised on a family farm in Arthur, Ontario. Her father, James J. Morrison, was a founder of the United Farmers of Ontario and served as the party's general secretary during the UFO's years in power. She married Richard Luckock, a tool-and-die maker, in 1914, and the couple ultimately settled in Toronto. Luckock worked as a seamstress during the Great Depression but had to go on social relief when she became unemployed. During this period, her daughter contracted scarlet fever and died. The tragedy motivated Luckock's lifelong fight for social programs. Co-operative Commonwealth Federation Rae Luckock joined the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) at its inception in 1932 and served as a local party activist. She ran for the Toronto school board several times before winning election as a trustee in 1943. Later that year she was the CCF's successful candidate in Bracondale for the provincial election and resigned her position on the school board. =Elected to Legislative Assembly of Ontario= The 1943 election was a major breakthrough for the Ontario CCF propelling them to official opposition status in a minority legislature with 34 seats. Luckock and Agnes Macphail were both elected to the provincial legislature for the first time that year, the first women ever to serve as Members of Provincial Parliament (MPPs). As new MPPs were usually sworn in in alphabetical order, Luckock was due to become the first woman ever sworn in as an MPP, but she deferred to Macphail in recognition of the latter's long career as a federal Member of Parliament. Luckock was thus the second woman to take the MPP's oath. In the legislature, Luckock served as the CCF's education critic and promoted the idea of free university tuition and improved rural education. She also championed the equality of women by advocating equal pay for equal work and pay for homemakers. Luckock was defeated in the 1945 provincial election which reduced the CCF caucus to only eight MPPs and third party status. She served as president of the Housewives and Consumers Association (HCA) from 1943 to 1944, and organized its 1948 \\"March of a Million Names\\" campaign that petitioned the federal government to lower the price of consumer goods. A million names were gathered for the petition which was presented to Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King by Luckock at a large rally on Parliament Hill. The campaign resulted in the federal government taking action against milling and baking companies for artificially fixing the price of bread. Alleged Communist affiliations Members of the communist Labor-Progressive Party were involved in the HCA leading it to be labelled a \\"communist front\\". The CCF had actively purged suspected Communists from its ranks since its founding and Luckock's involvement with the HCA brought her under suspicion and resulting in demands that she choose between leaving the HCA or being expelled from the CCF. Luckock chose the HCA and was expelled from the CCF in 1948. The party had a resurgence of fortunes in that year's provincial election and regained her riding of Bracondale but with Harry Walters as the new CCF standard-bearer instead of Luckock. The HCA joined with other women's groups to form the Congress of Canadian Women in 1950, and Luckock was elected its first president. The Congress was involved with the peace movement during the Cold War, and facilitated meetings between people from the Soviet Union and Canadians, by inviting them to visit Canada. =Banned from US= Luckock attended conferences of the World Peace Council, including one in the People's Republic of China in 1956. As a result, she was blacklisted, and was once barred from entry into the United States. She successfully argued that she should be allowed in. Luckock was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease shortly after her trip to China and spent the last years of her life in hospital.

Inorganic objects last longer than biological ones and the denser or larger objects contribute more bullets or greater energy discharge upon release. *If Gunfire attempts to use an object without a defined topological focal point (i.e. perfect sphere like a snowglobe), it would become a timed explosive, like a hand grenade.Gunfire #0 *On at least one occasion Gunfire was able to release a concussive force blast without using an object. He was able to agitate atoms in the air in front of his hands and released a powerful enough energy blast that sent his father flying through a wall.Gunfire #0 This would seem to indicate that his abilities also function on non-solid materials, since air itself has no defined focal point. *Gunfire's ability to convert matter to energy is similar to an ability possessed by Russian superhero Pozhar. *He can also use himself as a transferal conduit to channel another item's energized mass through. The greatest extent of which shown thus far included sticking one hand in hot lava to bleed off its mass into successive concussive blasts by channeling it through the other. All in order to render the molten rock inert and prevent a massive eruption. =DCnU= *Officer Blake's parasite derived abilities enable him to turn most anything he touches into a volatile material energy state. Once effectively transmorphed, most objects he uses his power on can be converted into raw destructive force. He can either dial the energy back or let it run its course wherein said alternated element explodes with varying degrees of blast power. *Blake's talent is not limited to tactile interaction, for he can use it on anything he makes eye contact with, having melted bullets mid-flight before they could reach him and/or energize open air for makeshift energy blasts. *The parasite within him also magnifies physical prowess once it fully takes hold of the subject. Under its thrall, Blake became strong enough to lift a mid-sized boulder over his head using nothing but his bare hands. It also has a better grasp on the powers bestowed than its host, the puppeteer entity could selectively convert parts of an object into energy to strengthen them. Such as converting the bullets in a gun or charging a nightstick.

The company was working on a regulator prototype for NASA. It was later stolen by a rogue doctor and criminal Laura Washington and augmented herself cybernetically with it as a Cyberwoman. She was defeated by The Flash and Supergirl.

To the south is Duck Mountain Provincial Park and Forest, to the north is Thunder Hill and further north of Swan River is Porcupine Mountain Provincial Park. Benito is served by PTH 83. People from Eastern Canada, England, and Europe first settled Benito around the beginning of the 20th century. In 1905, the Canadian National Railway went through, and Benito slowly grew and was incorporated as a village in 1941. The economic base of the region is agriculture and logging. Benito is home to a branch of the North-West Regional Library of nearby Swan River. Founded in 1965, today the North-West Regional Library Benito Branch provides over 14,000 books, DVDs, puzzles and other items accessible to the public as well as many other services. On April 1, 2013, Benito was featured in an April Fool's Day joke across the Province of Manitoba.

Designed in 1934 by architects Gregorio Sánchez, Ernesto Lagos and Luis María de la Torre, it is considered a pinnacle of modernist architecture. At the time of its inauguration in 1936, the Kavanagh was the tallest building in Latin America, as well as the tallest building in the world with a reinforced concrete structure. It is considered one of the quintessential buildings of Buenos Aires. A 2013 Clarín survey of 600 people who are not architects or builders found that the Kavanagh is the most liked building among porteños. The Kavanagh Building was declared a Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 1994 and a National Historic Monument of Argentina in 1999. Location The Kavanagh Building is located at 1065 Florida Street in the barrio of Retiro, overlooking Plaza San Martín. History View of the houses where the Kavanagh would later be built, 1926.The center of Buenos Aires in 1936, with the Kavanagh Building in the lower left corner. It was designed in 1934, by local architects Gregorio Sánchez, Ernesto Lagos and Luis María de la Torre, built by the constructor and engineer Rodolfo Cervini, and inaugurated in 1936. Standing at a height of 120 meters, the building is characterised by the austerity of its lines, the lack of external ornamentation, and its large prismatic volumes. It was declared a Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 1994 and a National Historic Monument by the Argentine government in 1999. In the year of its completion the building obtained the Municipal Award for Collective Houses and Facades (') and three years later its facade received a similar award from the American Institute of Architects. Its construction took only 14 months and was commissioned in 1934 by Corina Kavanagh, a millionaire of Irish descent who sold two ranches at the age of 39 to erect her own skyscraper. The building has a towering form, with symmetrical setbacks and gradual surface reductions. It was created from the outside in, adapting outstandingly comfortable facilities to the space available. The structure was carefully designed to be as slender as possible, in order to avoid unnecessary weight, and influenced by the city planning regulations. The design combines Modernism and Art Deco with a Rationalist approach and is considered the apex of early Modernism in Argentina. It was at the time the highest skyscraper in Latin America. As the apartments in the new building were aimed at the upper middle classes, no expense was spared in its construction in order to insure a result of the highest quality. All 105 apartments contained the latest in technological advances, including central air conditioning, twelve Otis elevators, and state-of-the-art plumbing. Those on the upper floors have exquisite terrace gardens with views of the river, parks and the city. Corina Kavanagh lived for many years on the 14th floor in the largest apartment, the only one that occupies an entire floor. There is a legend that says that the shape of the building was designed as a revenge. Corina, who was from a wealthy but not an aristocrat family, fell in love with the son of the Anchorena family, who were both wealthy and aristocratic. The Anchorenas, who lived in a palace on the other side of Plaza San Martín (today known as the San Martín Palace) and had built a church that they could see from their palace, disapproved of the engagement. In revenge, Corina made only one demand to the architects: that it would block the Anchorena family's view of their church. Architecture The Kavanagh Building is considered a leading example of International Style architecture, a current known locally as rationalism or modern movement.Balderston, González & López, 2000. p. 776 The building is sometimes classified as Art Deco due to the similarity of both styles. La Nacións Fabio Grementieri called it a \\"masterful synthesis of rationalism and Art Deco, of renewal and tradition, of Paris and New York.\\" Rationalism was introduced in Buenos Aires by intellectual Victoria Ocampo with the modernist house she commissioned to architect Alejandro Bustillo, built in Barrio Parque in 1929 and characterized by \\"simple cubic shapes, white walls and neat proportions\\". Its contrast with the Belle Époque-style houses of the rest of the neighborhood, popular among the city's upper classes, earned the building negative reviews. Nevertheless, Ocampo's house proved to be very influential as the rationalist style gained popularity during the 1930s. It was used in hospitals, movie theaters and a triad of high-rise buildings: the Kavanagh, Comega and Safico buildings. These early skyscrapers are characterized by the ziggurat-like approach of their design, mandated as per a municipal regulation analogous to New York City's 1916 Zoning Resolution, which had been adopted to stop tall buildings from preventing light and air from reaching the streets below. The Kavanagh Building showcases the growing influence of American architecture in the region at the time, caused by the political confrontation in Europe and technological transformations.

It minted gold sovereigns from 1872 until 1931, and half-sovereigns (intermittently) from 1873 until 1915. In 1916 it commenced minting Commonwealth silver threepences, sixpences, shillings and florins. From 1923 it minted all pre-decimal denominations. It minted rarities such as the 1921/22 overdate threepence, 1923 half-penny and 1930 penny, as well as Australia's four commemorative florins in 1927 (Canberra), 1934/35 (Melbourne Centenary), 1951 (Federation Jubilee) and 1954 (Royal Visit). It assisted the Royal Australian Mint in Canberra in producing one cent coins from 1966 to 1968 and two cent coins in 1966. From 1969 all coin production moved to the Royal Australian Mint in Canberra, and the building housing the coin minting equipment was demolished shortly afterwards. The remaining administrative building is now the home of the Royal Historical Society of Victoria, and has been leased to the private sector since 2001. The former Royal Mint is located on the corner of William and La Trobe Streets (280-318 William Street and 387-429 La Trobe Street) and is of architectural significance as one of the most impressive 19th century government buildings in Victoria, and one of few Australian buildings in the true Renaissance revival style, and a virtual copy of the Palazzo Vidoni-Caffarelli, attributed to Raphael, in Rome (1515). The mint was built between 1869 and 1872 to the designs of architect J.J Clark whose other notable works included the Old Treasury Building, Melbourne. It was opened 12 June 1872 The colourful coat of arms placed on the front gates in mid-twentieth century were by the Melbourne woodcarver Walter Langcake. The original design, based on Queen Victoria's coat of arms, is adapted especially for a British Royal Mint branch office in colonial Victoria.

June 12, 1864) was a merchant and a Confederate officer in the American Civil War. Brockman was born in South Carolina, the eldest son of Colonel and Senator Thomas Patterson Brockman and the granduncle of Tallulah Brockman Bankhead. He was also descended from John Brockman, Jr., and was the great-nephew of Major Brockman, both of whom were American Revolutionary War veterans in the English Brockman family, a cavalier family that settled in Virginia in the late 17th century. Organizing the Brockman Guards In the summer of 1861, Brockman and his brother, Jesse Kilgor Brockman, organized an infantry company in Spartanburg, South Carolina, that became known as \\"The Brockman Guards\\". By September the 13th South Carolina Infantry was officially organized and the Brockman Guards became Company B of that regiment. Brockman was made the Captain of Company B and his brother a lieutenant. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel upon the retirement of P.L. Calhoun, and Jesse Brockman then became the Captain of Company B. Benjamin ran a mercantile business in the Reidville area. Ladies from this area made a flag to commemorate the formation of Company B. It was blue, with gold stars and border. This flag is now housed and preserved in the Confederate Relic Room of the State of South Carolina in Columbia. The reverse side of the flag is an image of a South Carolina coastal scene by A. Grinevald, who was a painting and drawing teacher. \\"The Bloody Angle\\" \\"The Battle of Spottsylvania\\" by Thure de Thulstrup Battle of the Bloody Angle Brockman became Colonel of the 13th Regiment after Col. O. E. Edwards was killed. Benjamin led the 13th from 1863 at the Battle of Chancellorsville and lost an arm in a charge at the \\"Bloody Angle\\" near Spotsylvania Court House, May 12, 1864. He died one month later in a Richmond hospital from complications of this wound. Jesse was also injured in the charge and lay three days on the battlefield. He died of his wounds in the hospital on May 28, 1864. =Accounts of the Battle= Here, throughout the afternoon and well into the night, Yankee and Rebel fought each other with relentless determination. Nearby, a 22-inch oak, whittled in two by the incessant musket and artillery fire, gave testimony to the tenacity of both sides. Nothing but the piled up logs of breastworks separated the combatants. Our men would reach over the logs and fire into the faces of the enemy, would stab over with their bayonets; many were shot and stabbed through crevices and holes between logs; men mounted the works and with muskets rapidly handed them kept up a continuous fire until they were shot down, when others would take their places. --General L.A. Grant, USA The outnumbered Confederates eventually fell back to a new line, and the battle of May 12 ended. but the fight for the Bloody Angle stood out in sharp contrast from other battles. Its terrible slaughter seemed to signal a shift in each side's perception of this war. Never again would Lee have the strength to lead his men north; now, he fought to survive. Grant, too, left here with a clearer, albeit brutal, image of the future. No matter what the cost, he would fight Lee's army until he destroyed it. Burial Benjamin Brockman is buried at Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia. After he was wounded, he wrote his sister, Mrs. Harris, wife of Dr. Harris of Rutherford, North Carolina, the following letter: : May 24, Richmond, Virginia : Dear Sister Mary; : I have been unfortunate in losing my left arm in the Battle of the 12th of May, the bloodiest fight of the War. Jesse was wounded, I suspect dangerously, and fell into the hands of the enemy. Poor fellow û the only brother I had is now perhaps cold in death, but we have to submit to such things. He was, I am informed, acting with distinguished valor, when shot. Excuse short note. My respects to the Doctor and a kiss to Edgar. : Truly your brother : B.T. Brockman Captain Jesse K. Brockman Jesse K. Brockman Col. Brockman's brother, Jesse K. Brockman, was born April 23, 1839. He was married on January 10, 1861, to Kittie Bryson. They had two sons.

It starts at the eastern end of the Bear Mountain Bridge at an intersection with U.S. Route 6 (US 6) and US 202 in Westchester County, and follows the eastern shore of the Hudson River for to a junction with US 9 north of the village of Wappingers Falls in Dutchess County. While US 9 follows a more inland routing between the bridge and Wappingers Falls, the riverside course of NY 9D takes the route through the village of Cold Spring and the city of Beacon. The route was acquired by the state of New York in pieces over the course of the early 20th century. The part north of Beacon was entirely state-maintained by the end of the 1910s, while delays in rebuilding the remainder of the highway to state highway standards kept New York from fully acquiring the road until the early 1930s. NY 9D was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, extending only from Beacon to Wappingers Falls. It was extended south to the Bear Mountain Bridge by the following year. Route description =Westchester and Putnam counties= Like its parent road, US 9, NY 9D runs north–south parallel to the Hudson River for its entire length. The route begins near the riverbank at the Bear Mountain Bridge in the Westchester County town of Cortlandt, where it meets US 6 and US 202 at the foot of Anthony's Nose. It heads to the northeast as a two-lane road known as the Bear Mountain–Beacon Highway, passing through dense forests in the undeveloped northwestern part of Camp Smith. After just a quarter-mile (0.4 km), NY 9D leaves the military reservation as it passes into Putnam County and the town of Philipstown. Here, the route crosses the Appalachian Trail and runs adjacent to part of Hudson Highlands State Park, a preserve covering three non-contiguous areas between Peekskill and Beacon. Breakneck Ridge and the tunnel From the county line to the hamlet of Garrison, a distance of , NY 9D passes a few historical areas, such as the house Benedict Arnold was holed up in prior to his treason, the point of land where he caught the ship downriver to New York City, and the eastern end of the chain that was strung across the Hudson River during the American Revolution to prevent ships from coming upriver north of West Point. The highway serves a small number of isolated homes on its way to Garrison, where it meets the western terminus of NY 403 at a junction adjacent to The Birches and the Garrison Grist Mill Historic District. NY 403 is the first of several roads directly connecting NY 9D to US 9, which follows a generally parallel alignment east of the former through southern Putnam County. From Garrison, NY 9D heads through a stretch of lightly developed areas, intersecting County Route 11 (CR 11, named Snake Hill Road), another connector to US 9, and passing the Boscobel mansion on its way into the village of Cold Spring. The highway, now named Chestnut Street, heads generally westward to the center of the village, where NY 9D intersects Main Street, designated as NY 301 east of this point. On the opposite side of the intersection, NY 9D changes names to Morris Avenue for a half-mile (0.8 km) before exiting Cold Spring on a northwesterly track. Past the village line, the route parallels the Metro-North Railroad for through another portion of Hudson Highlands State Park. This section of the route, located mere yards from the river, is locally known as the River Road, for its close proximity to the river, and The Flats, for its relatively consistent elevation. The two- mile stretch leads to a tunnel through the Breakneck Ridge, which carries NY 9D across the Putnam–Dutchess county line. =Dutchess County= Approaching Beacon on NY 9D northbound Heading away from the ridge, NY 9D continues on a northerly path through the town of Fishkill, serving the Breakneck Ridge station on the Metro-North Railroad before turning northeastward and diverging from the Metro-North line and the Hudson River. The road soon reaches the southern edge of the city of Beacon, where it becomes Wolcott Avenue and the surroundings transition from rural mountainous scenery to an urban setting. Maintenance of the route also shifts from the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) to the city. Upon reaching the city center, NY 9D traverses a 90-degree bend to the northwest and becomes the main north-south street through the city. The highway crosses Fishkill Creek ahead of another 90-degree turn, this time to the northeast, giving NY 9D an S-shaped alignment as it travels through downtown Beacon. State maintenance of the road resumes one block east of the northeasterly bend. North of the turn, NY 9D intersects Main Street, which carries NY 52 Business through Beacon's central business district. NY 52 Business turns north onto NY 9D here, forming a concurrency along the latter as Wolcott Avenue changes names to North Avenue. The overlapping routes wind their way northward through several residential blocks to reach an interchange with Interstate 84 (I-84) and NY 52 just north of the city limits in Fishkill. NY 52 Business terminates at the junction while NY 9D continues to meander northeastward through the northernmost part of the town. The highway runs by several housing tracts and Dutchess Stadium, the home of the Hudson Valley Renegades, a Single-A Minor League Baseball team, before crossing into the adjacent town of Wappinger. Downtown Wappingers Falls Across the town line, the road takes on a straighter northeasterly track that brings it east of the hamlets of Chelsea and New Hamburg, both of which lie roughly to the west on the banks of the Hudson. NY 9D connects to Chelsea by way of CR 92 just north of the town line, while New Hamburg is accessed via CR 28 in the community of Hughsonville. From CR 28, the highway continues into the nearby village of Wappingers Falls, which it enters from the south as South Avenue. NY 9D traverses several blocks of homes on the eastern edge of the Wappingers Falls Historic District before it meets East Main Street at a T-intersection in the center of the village. Mesier Park is straight ahead, and the Wappingers Falls Village Hall is on the southeastern corner of the junction. South Avenue ends at this point, leaving NY 9D to turn northwest onto East Main Street. The highway follows East Main Street for several blocks through the central village district before crossing Wappinger Creek, which serves as the boundary between the towns of Wappinger and Poughkeepsie. Past the creek, the route changes names to West Main Street and makes a sharp bend to the north, passing the Bain Commercial Building and running alongside Wappinger Lake for a short distance before leaving the village limits. The road serves a handful of homes on the northern fringe of Wappinger Falls prior to entering a commercial district surrounding a junction with US 9 near the South Hills Mall and the Poughkeepsie Galleria. NY 9D ends here while its right-of-way continues past US 9 as County Route 77 (Vassar Road). History Modern NY 9D was acquired by the state of New York in stages over the course of the early 20th century. The first section to become a state highway was the piece between the Fishkill–Wappinger town line and the village of Wappingers Falls, which was added to the state highway system on June 28, 1905. State maintenance was extended south to the Beacon city line on December 30, 1907. In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route 2, an unsigned legislative route following the Albany Post Road from New York City to Valatie. The post road originally passed through Wappingers Falls, entering from the southeast on East Main Street and leaving to the north on West Main Street. The road's northern approach to the village was taken over by the state of New York on July 6, 1911. South Avenue in Wappingers Falls became state-maintained on February 15, 1917, extending state ownership north from the village line to South Avenue's junction with East Main Street. The part of Main Street between South Avenue and the northern village limits was added as a state road on January 5, 1918. When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, Main Street became part of NY 6, which followed all of legislative Route 2 north of Ossining. NY 6 was replaced by US 9 in 1927 following the creation of the U.S. Highway System. This edition shows U.S. Routes as they were first officially signed in 1927. The part of what is now NY 9D south of Beacon remained an unimproved local road through the mid-1920s. The reconstruction of this segment was authorized in 1925, and the highway was designated as legislative Route 2-a on April 2 of that year. Construction on parts of the road was stalled for years, however, with the delay on the stretch north of Cold Spring being attributed to problems in acquiring the highway's right-of-way. Work on the portion south of Garrison was completed by February 1930. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, the Beacon–Wappingers Falls state highway was designated as NY 9D while the road between the Bear Mountain Bridge and Garrison became part of NY 9C, which continued north to Cold Spring and south through Peekskill to Croton-on-Hudson. NY 9D was extended south to the Bear Mountain Bridge by the following year, replacing NY 9C from Cold Spring to the bridge. The reconstruction of the Garrison–Cold Spring stretch was finished by February 1931, and the Cold Spring–Beacon link was opened in October 1932. Various festivities were held in Beacon on October 20 to mark the occasion. In the early to mid-1930s, US 9 was realigned near Wappingers Falls to follow a new highway bypassing the village to the east, even though the project was staunchly opposed by the village's chamber of commerce. The northern half of US 9's former routing through the village became an extension of NY 9D.

Lule may be extinct today. Campbell (1997) writes that in 1981 there was an unconfirmed report that Lule is still spoken by 5 families in Resistencia in east-central Chaco Province. It is unclear if it is the same language as Tonocoté. Varieties Unattested varieties classified by Loukotka (1968) as part of the Lule language cluster. *Tonocoté - once spoken on the Bermejo River near Concepción, Chaco. *Isistiné - once spoken on the Salado River near San Juan de Valbuena, Chaco. *Oristine - once spoken on the Salado River near San Juan de Valbuena, Chaco. *Toquistiné - once spoken on the Salado River near Miraflores. *Matará / Amulahí - once spoken near the city of the same name on the Salado River. *Jurí - extinct language of an agricultural tribe that lived on the Hondo and Salado Rivers, province of Santiago del Estero. The last survivors now speak only a Quechua dialect. Genetic relations Lule appears to be distantly related to the still-spoken Vilela language, together forming a small Lule–Vilela family. Kaufman (1990) finds this relationship likely and with general agreement among the major classifiers of South American languages. Viegas Barros published additional evidence 1996–2006. Zamponi (2008) and other authors consider Lule and Vilela two linguistic isolates. There were three distinct groups known as Lulé: *The nomadic Lule of the plains, who in addition to their own language, spoke Tonocote, the local lingua franca and the language of Spanish catechism. *The sedentary Lule of the foothills, who were trilingual in Lule, Tonocote, and Quechua in addition to their original language, Cacán. *The Lule-Tonocote, whose language was recorded by Machoni. Data In 1586 Father Alonson Bárzana (Bárcena) wrote a grammar of Tonocote, which is now lost. In 1732 Antonio Maccioni (Machoni), who was not aware of Bárzana's grammar, wrote one of his own, Arte y vocabulario de la lengua lule y tonocoté ('Art and vocabulary of the language of the Lule and Tonocote') of the Lule-Tonocote language at the mission San Esteban de Miraflores. This is our primary data on the language. Métraux (1946) concluded that Lule and Tonocote were distinct, and perhaps unrelated, languages, and that the Tonocote at the Miraflores mission had shifted to the Lule language by the time of Machoni. Machoni records a language with vowels and few consonants. Final syllables are stressed. There are consonant clusters in initial and final position: quelpç 'I split', slimst 'I blow my nose', oalécst 'I know', stuç 'I throw'.

Sibrel is a proponent of the conspiracy theory that the six Apollo Moon landing missions between 1969 and 1972 were elaborate hoaxes perpetrated by the United States government, including NASA. The film is narrated by British stage actress Anne Tonelson. Overview Sibrel's claims that the moon landing was a hoax making claims about supposed photographic anomalies; disasters such as the destruction of Apollo 1; technical difficulties experienced in the 1950s and 1960s; and the problems of traversing the Van Allen radiation belts. Sibrel proposes that the most condemning evidence is a piece of footage that he claims was secret, and inadvertently sent to him by NASA; he alleges that the footage shows Apollo 11 astronauts attempting to create the illusion that they were from Earth (or roughly halfway to the Moon) when, he claims, they were only in a low Earth orbit. The film also asserts that NASA's early inexperience in rocket technology and inconsistencies in NASA's records could point to a possible hoax, and that the Space Race was actually a race to develop armaments with the huge budget allocated to the Apollo missions. The film's premise is that NASA perpetrated a fraud because of the perception that if the United States could land men on the Moon before the Soviet Union, it would be a major victory in the Cold War, since the Soviets had been the first to achieve a successful space launch (Sputnik 1 in 1957), the first crewed space flight (Vostok 1 in 1961), and the first spacewalk (Voskhod 2 in 1965).  Criticisms  Amanda Hess of The New York Times characterized the film as a \\"quasi-investigation\\". She referred to the film as a \\"'documentary'\\", in scare quotes, and to Sibrel as a \\"sincere kook\\", writing: \\"[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon] mashed up moon footage with ominous shots from the Soviet Union and Vietnam, was narrated by a severe British woman and was sold on a website called MoonMovie.com.\\" Jim McDade, writing in The Birmingham News, wrote that A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon is \\"full of falsehoods, innuendo, strident accusations, half-truths, flawed logic and premature conclusions.\\" According to McDade, the \\"only thing new and weird\\" in the film is that the claim that video views of Earth were actually filmed through a small hole to give the impression that Apollo 11 was not in low Earth orbit. \\"Bart has misinterpreted things that are immediately obvious to anyone who has extensively read Apollo history and documentation or anyone who has ever been inside an Apollo Command Module or accurate mockup,\\" says McDade.

Several species of sand lances are commonly known as \\"sand eels\\", though they are not related to true eels. Another variant name is launce,Bigalow & Schroeder, 1953 and all names of the fish are references to its slender body and pointed snout. The family name (and genus name, Ammodytes) means \\"sand burrower\\", which describes the sand lance's habit of burrowing into sand to avoid tidal currents. Sand lances are most commonly encountered by fishermen in the North Pacific and North Atlantic, but are found in oceans throughout the world. These fish do not have pelvic fins and do not develop swim bladders, staying true to their bottom-dwelling habit as adults. Both adult and larval sea lances primarily feed on copepods. Larval forms of this fish are perhaps the most abundant of all fish larvae in areas such as the northwest Atlantic, serving as a major food item for cod, salmon, whales and other commercially important species. As adults, sand lances are harvested commercially in some areas (primarily in Europe), leading to direct human competition with diving birds such as puffins, auks, terns, and cormorants. Some species are inshore coastal dwellers, and digging for sand lances to use as a bait fish has been a popular pastime in coastal areas of Europe and North America.

He served in World War II and the 1947 Indo- Pakistani War, becoming an artillery regiment commander. He went on to work in armaments research and development, his innovations including an Indian 10mm light field gun and upgunning of the Sherman tanks. He also contributed to set up two major laboratories. Jetley retired in 1979 and moved to the United Kingdom. Early life Jetley was born in Rawalpindi to a military family. His grandfather, Subedar Maya Das Jetley held the Indian Distinguished Service Medal (IDSM), having served on the North Western frontier and in World War I; his father, Lt. Col Kundan Lal Jetley, MBE, participated with the British Expeditionary Forces in Burma and Shanghai, China during peace time, and served in World War II. Jetley's uncles, Major Mangal Sain Jetley, Major Inder Sen Jetley, also served in World War II. Jetley's mother, Kaushaliya Rani, was the daughter of High Court advocate Shivram Jhingan. Jetley was educated at Quetta, Lansdowne and Dehra Dun, followed by higher education at the Gordon Mission College, Rawalpindi. Wartime career Jetley was commissioned on 5 July 1942 and served in Arakan, Burma. He took part in the Battle of Ramree Island and the Allied landings at Letpan, mainland Burma, where, as naval Forward Observation Officer for a field artillery regiment, he called in the naval bombardment. From 1945–1946 he served with an Indian anti-tank regiment in Sumatra, Indonesia as a part of the British occupation. In 1946, Jetley became a Captain in the regular army and travelled to Britain for training at the Royal School of Artillery, Larkhill, along with Om Prakash Malhotra (later General Chief of Army Staff) and J. F. R. Jacob (later Lt General, Governor Punjab). In 1948, he took part in the Jammu & Kashmir Operations of the Indo- Pakistani War, involving the re-capture of Jhangar, capture of Rajouri and the Punch linkup. Peacetime artillery service From 1950, he served with the Technical Development Establishments at Jabalpur, Cossipore and later Kanpur and raised Inspectorates for the two major Ordnance Factories. At Kanpur he was credited for contributing to the manufacture of the first 25 Pounder Ordnance and the first Bren Gun in India. The occasion was celebrated by the Ordnance factory by firing of the first Bren Gun in the presence of Shri Rajendra Prasad, first President of India. In 1952, he commanded an anti-tank regiment artillery. From 1953–1958 he commanded one of the then only two Medium Artillery Regiments and later raised the third Medium Regiment Artillery. With this newly raised unit, he earned a name in exercise 'Doaba' by taking his medium guns across the river Sutlej by dismantling, which was commended by the Corps Commander Lt. Gen. J. N. Chaudhari and Lt. Gen. Kulwant Singh, the chief Umpire and General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Western Command. It was here that he also conceived the idea of up-gunning the Sherman Tank for better firepower and put up a paper to the General Staff. This was to have a salutary effect on the outcome of the 1965 Indo-Pak War. Scientific career Maj. Gen Jetley demonstrating 105mm light field gun prototype designed by his team to Defence Minister Jagjivan Ram During his second tenure (from 1958 onwards) with TDEs and the Defence Research and Development Organisation, he had a distinguished career in various capacities. As Superintendent, Proof and Experiment Establishment, he conceived, planned and modernised the previous ranges to enable enhancement of indigenous production and evaluation of foreign manufacturer's claims. In addition to the normal call of duties, he had been personally responsible for projecting new ideas which led to the improvement in the performance of various service equipments. A few outstanding examples showing his ingenuity and skill were:- * Mounting of 75 mm High Velocity French Gun on the Sherman tank. * Conversion of 4.7\\" Naval Gun mounting to take 4.5\\" Naval gun. * Modification of 25 Pdr carriage for high angle fire. * Universal slave carriage/mounting for proof of any calibre gun and ammunition (Railway Open Wagon on broad gauge rails). It is estimated that he saved over 1 billion of assets in the form of saving old tanks from disposal. Due to his efforts, the production of 4.5\\" ammunition in the country could begin at least one year earlier than by waiting for such facility to be provided by a foreign supplier. The facility was inaugurated by demonstrating proof of first lot of indigenous naval 4.5\\" ammunition in the presence of Admiral Katari, then Chief of the Naval Staff of India. Later Jetley was assigned to the special Weapon Design Team. During this period his contribution for planning and organisation along with others resulted in establishing the Defence Research and Development Laboratories for rockets and missile. Jetley's contribution was also admired in the raising of the Terminal Ballistic Research Laboratory for research in the field of transient phenomenon involving detonation of explosives. Thus reasonable amount of credit for setting up of these two major laboratories equipped with most modern instrumentation goes to him. He exhibited the first uncontrolled flight of a short range missile to the Defence Minister at Tuglakabad ranges in 1961 as desired by the Scientific Adviser Bhagwantam. This success had great contribution from Wing Commander Sethna and Bensal. In 1968, he was assigned to the Directorate General of Inspection, a quality assurance organisation, where, as Senior Inspector of Armaments and Gauges, he further excelled his performance and was responsible for improving the quality of inspection of 40 mm anti-aircraft guns. He was also instrumental in enhancing the production of Mountain guns at Heavy Engineering Corporation at Ranchi and Gun Carriage Factory Jabalpur for which he was commended by the Secretary Defence Production and DGOF. He was hence sent for training to Sweden in Air Defence Systems with BOFORS and became a member of the Technical Committee for the Indian collaboration. In 1971, he raised the Controllerate of Inspection (Weapons) which was a great bonus during the 1971 War for inspection of imported weapons. After war he contributed by making an assessment of the effect of Pakistani weapons which was a good guide for future improvements and defect investigations. From 1973 as Director of Inspection (Armaments), he was personally responsible for increasing the pace of indigenisation in the private sector. Later he helped in establishing the production of an anti-tank ammunition by revising acceptance criteria, after his return from the Jefferson Proving Grounds in the USA. He encouraged the export of armaments as Director of Inspection (Armaments) and he was later nominated by the Defence Secretary to go to FFV Sweden to inspect the first 84 mm Carl Gustaf Rocket Launcher consignment. He was assigned in 1976 to develop a Light Field Gun of 105 mm for the Army. In a very short period from the date of his take over, he produced the first proto-type involving induction of most modern materials (three new varieties of steel were developed at Durgapur steel plant) and sophisticated technology in the field of gun development resulting in a light carriage of half weight and India's first Ordnance design. Simultaneously, he developed a time fuze for the carrier shells of long range guns by modifying an existing time fuze. The development of Smoke and HESH ammunition for this light gun IFG Mark II and IFG Mark I had his contribution. Awards and recognition For the exemplary work with his new ideas, he received under heading Honours and Awards in the Army Orders two commendation cards from the Chief of the Army Staff, one was on the recommendation of the Chief of the Naval Staff. Also, two of the first cash awards given by the Ministry of Defence, when introduced, went to him for his inventions. In view of his excellent allround performance in the field of engineering and applied technology, he was made a Fellow of Institution of Engineers (India) and Fellow of the Institution of Quality Assurance (UK). Besides all other achievements to his credit for making an investigation of national importance of an armament store he was awarded the commendation card of the Secretary (Defense Production) in 1977. Jetley rendered 37 years service and retired on 9 July 1979 after two extensions in the Service interest. Publications Jetley has written a number of technical papers on the improvement in the performance of Army equipment, including a proposal to convert Stuart tanks to APCs. He has also published two books, one restricted for artillery officers promotion examination and one for the open market Rockets, Satellites and Guided Missiles. His National Defence College paper on Future pattern of Weapons System (1970), led to him represent the course at the Parliamentarians' meeting on Atom Bomb considerations. This paper was later published in the USI magazine. Teaching During his four years as Director of Studies (Army) at the Institute of Armament Technology, Jetley revised the Technical Staff Officers' Course by introducing studies for future armament needs, which resulted in an exercise to up-gun the T55 Tank with the British 105 mm Tank Gun. This was later adapted by the Army. He also introduced the Scientific Orientation Courses for Army Officers and compiled the Indian Army instructional pamphlet (Science) for the Army. His critical innovation Credit for the availability of the up-gunned World War II vintage Shermans in 1965 to successfully combat the American supplied M48 Pattons goes to Jetley and to the General Staff of the Army, who provided him with a Sherman Tank to experiment for what was then a radical idea. The result is described in extract of two newspaper articles below. For this innovation he was paid merely 2000 as a cash award to kill the dream of Field Marshal Ayub Khan to capture Delhi. *Extract from The Economic Times New Delhi Wednesday 6 September 1995 page 7 an article by Global Watch/K Subrahmanyam titled \\"The First War with Pak\\" ::\\"Third, the Pakistanis has secretly raised a second armoured division while India had only one then...The Pakistani armoured division which was to break through at Khem Karan was totally destroyed by an Indian armoured brigade consisting of one Centurion regiment, one regiment of Sherman Mark IV tanks and another with up-gunned Shermans.

The name Nitrobacter derives from the Latin neuter gender noun nitrum, nitri, alkalis; the Ancient Greek noun βακτηρία, βακτηρίᾱς, rod. They are non-motile and reproduce via budding or binary fission. Nitrobacter cells are obligate aerobes and have a doubling time of about 13 hours. Nitrobacter play an important role in the nitrogen cycle by oxidizing nitrite into nitrate in soil and marine systems. Unlike plants, where electron transfer in photosynthesis provides the energy for carbon fixation, Nitrobacter uses energy from the oxidation of nitrite ions, NO2−, into nitrate ions, NO3−, to fulfill their energy needs. Nitrobacter fix carbon dioxide via the Calvin cycle for their carbon requirements. Nitrobacter belongs to the α-subclass of the Proteobacteria.  Morphology and Characteristics  Nitrobacter are gram-negative bacteria and are either rod- shaped, pear-shaped or pleomorphic. They are typically 0.5–0.9 μm in width and 1.0–2.0 μm in length and have an intra-cytomembrane polar cap. Due to the presence of cytochromes c, they are often yellow in cell suspensions. The nitrate oxidizing system on membranes is cytoplasmic. Nitrobacter cells have been shown to recover following extreme carbon dioxide exposure and are non- motile.  Phylogeny  16s rRNA sequence analysis phylogenetically places Nitrobacter within the class of Alphaproteobacteria. Pairwise evolutionary distance measurements within the genus are low compared to those found in other genera, and are less than 1%. Nitrobacter are also closely related to other species within the alpha subdivision, including the photosynthetic Rhodopseudomonas palustris, the root-nodulating Bradyrhizobium japonicum and Blastobacter denitrificans, and the human pathogens Afipia felis and Afipia clevelandensis. Bacteria within the genus Nitrobacter are presumed to have arose on multiple occasions from a photosynthetic ancestor, and for individual nitrifying genera and species there is evidence that the nitrification phenotype evolved separately from that found in photosynthetic bacteria. All known nitrite-oxidizing prokaryotes are restricted to a handful of phylogenetic groups. This includes the genus Nitrospira within the phylum Nitrospirae, and the genus Nitrolancetus from the phylum Chloroflexi. Before 2004, nitrite oxidation was believed to only occur within Proteobacteria; it is likely that further scientific inquiry will expand the list of known nitrite-oxidizing species. The low diversity of species oxidizing nitrite oxidation contrasts with other processes associated with the nitrogen cycle in the ocean, such as denitrification and N-fixation, where a diverse range of taxa perform analogous functions.  Nitrification  Nitrification is a crucial component of the nitrogen cycle, especially in the oceans. The production of nitrate (NO3−) by oxidation of nitrite (NO2−) by nitrification the process that produces the inorganic nitrogen that supplies much of the demand by marine oxygenic, photosynthetic organisms such as phytoplankton, particularly in areas of upwelling. For this reason, nitrification supplies much of the nitrogen that fuels planktonic primary production in the world's oceans. Nitrification is estimated to be the source of half of the nitrate consumed by phytoplankton globally. Phytoplankton are major contributors to oceanic production, and are therefore important for the biological pump which exports carbon and other particulate organic matter from the surface waters of the world's oceans. The process of nitrification is crucial for separating recycled production from production leading to export. Biologically metabolized nitrogen returns to the inorganic dissolved nitrogen pool in the form of ammonia. Microbe-mediated nitrification converts that ammonia into nitrate, which can subsequently be taken up by phytoplankton and recycled. The nitrite oxidation reaction performed by the Nitrobacter is as follows; NO2− \\\\+ H2O → NO3− \\\\+ 2H+ \\\\+ 2e− 2H+ \\\\+ 2e− \\\\+ ½O2 → H2O The Gibbs' Free Energy yield for nitrite oxidation is: ΔGο = -74 kJ mol−1 NO2− In the oceans, nitrite- oxidizing bacteria such as Nitrobacter are usually found in close proximity to ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. These two reactions together make up the process of nitrification. The nitrite-oxidation reaction generally proceeds more quickly in ocean waters, and therefore is not a rate-limiting step in nitrification. For this reason, it is rare for nitrite to accumulate in ocean waters. The two-step conversion of ammonia to nitrate observed in bacteria species such as Nitrobacter is puzzling to researchers. Complete nitrification, the conversion of ammonia to nitrate in a single step, has an energy yield (∆G°′) of −349 kJ mol−1 NH3, while the energy yields for the ammonia-oxidation and nitrite-oxidation steps of the observed two-step reaction are −275 kJ mol−1 NH3, and −74 kJ mol−1 NO2−, respectively. These values indicate that it would be energetically favourable for an organism to carry out complete nitrification from ammonia to nitrate, rather than conduct only one of the two steps. The evolutionary motivation for a decoupled, two- step nitrification reaction is an area of ongoing research. In 2015, it was discovered that the genus Nitrospira possesses all the enzymes required for carrying out complete nitrification in one step, suggesting that this reaction does occur. This discovery raises questions about evolutionary capability of Nitrobacter to conduct only nitrite-oxidation.  Metabolism and Growth  Members of the genus Nitrobacter use nitrite as a source of electrons (reductant), O2 as a source of energy, Schmidt-Rohr, K. (2020). \\"Oxygen Is the High-Energy Molecule Powering Complex Multicellular Life: Fundamental Corrections to Traditional Bioenergetics” ACS Omega 5: 2221-2233. http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.9b03352 and CO2 as a carbon source. Nitrite is not a particularly favourable substrate from which to gain energy. Thermodynamically, nitrite oxidation gives a yield (∆G°′) of only -74 kJ mol−1 NO2−. As a result, Nitrobacter has developed a highly specialized metabolism to derive energy from the oxidation of nitrite. Cells in the genus Nitrobacter reproduce by budding or binary fission. Carboxysomes, which aid carbon fixation, are found in lithoautotrophically and mixotrophically grown cells. Additional energy conserving inclusions are PHB granules and polyphosphates. When both nitrite and organic substances are present, cells can exhibit biphasic growth; first the nitrite is used and after a lag phase, organic matter is oxidized. Chemoorganotroph growth is slow and unbalanced, thus more poly-β-hydroxybutyrate granules are seen that distort the shape and size of the cells. The enzyme responsible for the oxidation of nitrite to nitrate in members of the genus Nitrobacter is nitrite oxidoreductase (NXR), which is encoded by the gene nxrA. NXR is composed of two subunits, and likely forms an αβ-heterodimer. The enzyme exists within the cell on specialized membranes in the cytoplasm that can be folded into vesicles or tubes. The α-subunit is thought to be the location of nitrite oxidation, and the β-subunit is an electron channel from the membrane. The direction of the reaction catalyzed by NXR can be reversed depending on oxygen concentrations. The region of the nxrA gene which encodes for the β-subunit of the NXR enzyme is similar in sequence to the iron-sulfur centers of bacterial ferredoxins, and to the β-subunit of the enzyme nitrate reductase, found in Escherichia coli.  Ecology and Distribution  The Aquatic Nitrogen Cycle. The conversion of nitrite to nitrate is facilitated by species in the genera Nitrobacter and Nitrospira. The genus Nitrobacter is widely distributed in both aquatic and terrestrial environments. Nitrifying bacteria have an optimum growth between 25 and 30 °C, and cannot survive past the upper limit of 49 °C or the lower limit of 0 °C. This limits their distribution even though they can be found in a wide variety of habitats. Cells in the genus Nitrobacter have an optimum pH for growth between 7.3 and 7.5, and will die at temperatures exceeding 120 °F (49 °C) or below 32 °F (0 °C). According to Grundmann, Nitrobacter seem to grow optimally at 38 °C and at a pH of 7.9, but Holt states that Nitrobacter grow optimally at 28 °C and within a pH range of 5.8 to 8.5, although they have a pH optima between 7.6 and 7.8. The primary ecological role of members of the genus Nitrobacter is to oxidize nitrite to nitrate, a primary source on inorganic nitrogen for plants. Members of the genus Nitrospira also play an important role as nitrite oxidizers. This role is also essential in aquaponics. Since all members in the genus Nitrobacter are obligate aerobes, oxygen along with phosphorus tend to be factors that limit their capability to perform nitrogen fixation. One of the major impacts of Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter in both oceanic and terrestrial ecosystems is on the process of eutrophication. The distribution and differences in nitrification rates across different species of Nitrobacter may be attributed to differences in the plasmids among species, as data presented in Schutt (1990) imply, habitat-specific plasmid DNA was induced by adaptation for some of the lakes that were investigated. A follow- up study performed by Navarro et al. (1995) showed that various Nitrobacter populations carry two large plasmids. In conjunction with Schutts’ (1990) study, Navarro et al. (1995) illustrated genomic features that may play crucial roles in determining the distribution and ecological impact of members of the genus Nitrobacter. Nitrifying bacteria in general tend to be less abundant than their heterotrophic counterparts, as the oxidizing reactions they perform have a low energy yield and most of their energy production goes toward carbon-fixation rather than growth and reproduction.  History  Sergei Nikolaievich Winogradsky In 1890, Ukrainian-Russian microbiologist Sergei Winogradsky isolated the first pure cultures of nitrifying bacteria which are capable of growth in the absence of organic matter and sunlight. The exclusion of organic material by Winogradsky in the preparation of his cultures is recognized as a contributing factor to his success in isolating the microbes. In 1891, English chemist Robert Warington proposed a two-stage mechanism for nitrification, mediated by two distinct genera of bacteria. The first stage proposed was the conversion of ammonia to nitrite, and the second the oxidation of nitrite to nitrate. Winogradsky named the bacteria responsible for the oxidation of nitrite to nitrate Nitrobacter in his subsequent study on microbial nitrification in 1892. Winslow et al. proposed the type species Nitrobacter winogradsky in 1917. The species was officially recognized in 1980.

Tlapacoya was a major site for the Tlatilco culture. Tlapacoya is known in particular for Tlapacoya figurines. These sophisticated earthware figurines were generally created between 1500 and 300 BCE and are representative of the Preclassic Period. Tlapacoya was also a manufacturing center for so-called \\"Dragon Pots\\" (see photo below).Diehl, Ch. 7.

Tlapacoya style figurine, 1200-900 BC, Walters Art Museum Clay Bowl, pigmented, 1200–900 BC, showing an Olmec-style design (from the Raymond and Laura Wielgus Collection, Indiana University Art Museum). In addition to the figurines and other artifacts from the 1500 - 300 BCE era, human and animal remains have been found, some of which could be as much as 25,000 years old. The most controversial findings in Tlapacoya are artifacts which have been dated by some researchers to as early as 25,000 BP. If verified, these would be some of the earliest dates for human habitation in the Americas and would discredit prevailing theories of the timing of settlement of the New World. The evidence for these much-earlier dates consists of the bones of black bear and two species of deer which appeared in middens associated with 22,000-year-old hearths, as well as a curved obsidian blade which was found beneath a buried tree trunk. The bones were 24,000 years BP (± 4000 years) and 21,700 years BP (± 500 years).Lorenzo and Mirambell 1999:(488-489) The obsidian blade was found under a tree trunk which dated to 24,000 years BP (± 1000 years) and was itself dated, using the obsidian hydration method, to between 21,250 and 25,000 years BP. The site was uncovered during the construction of a Mexico City-Puebla freeway and has since been almost completely obliterated by freeway construction. In 1955, Beatriz Barba, \\"the first Mexican woman to obtain the title of archaeologist\\", earned her master's degree with a study of the site. Her thesis, Tlapacoya: un sitio preclásico de transición (Tlapacoya: a pre-classic transitional site) evaluated the social development and religious practices of the Tlatilco culture. Barba's evaluation of the site was one of the first to evaluate the socio-economic and political life of the inhabitants of Tlapacoya within the context of the history of the region, as well as their trade relationships and the influence of other groups upon the development of the Tlatilco people. =Human remains= Silvia González et al. have published research claiming that \\"one Tlapacoya skull is the first directly dated human in Mexico with an age of 9730 ± 65 years BP\\" (before present).Gonzalez, S., Jimenez-Lopez, J.C, Hedges, R., Huddart, D., Ohman, J.C., Turner, A. and Pompa y Padilla,J.A. 2003.

His extant work, Eisagogika, or Introductory Matters (or Introduction), which was written in 378 AD, is a treatment of major topics in astrology as practiced in the fourth century Roman Empire. Biography Little is known about Paulus' life. He lived in Alexandria, one of the most scholarly cities of the Roman world, where astrology was also at its most sophisticated. In his lifetime, Rome's power was declining and the capital of the Roman Empire had been moved to Constantinople. We know he was regarded as a considerable authority because we have the record of a series of lectures given on his work by the respected Neo-Platonist philosopher Olympiodorus some two centuries later (in 564 AD), in Alexandria. These lectures were preserved in a Commentary and both Paulus' Introduction and Olympiodorus' Commentary have been translated together,Late Classical Astrology: Paulus Alexandrinus and Olympiodorus (with the Scholia of later Latin Commentators). [Translated by Dorian Gieseler Greenbaum.] Archive for the Retrieval of Historical Astrological Texts (ARHAT) , 2001. giving a view of the development of astrological technique and contemporary attitudes towards astrology from the tumultuous late Empire through the even more unstable early Byzantine Empire. The Introduction may be most interesting for its discussion of the eleven phases of the Moon, because it gives us a clear treatment of a topic whose influence on Greek astrological speculation has likely been much underestimatedLate Classical Astrology, 2001, pp. 92–97ff. The Moon's phases are probably the single most influential factor in katarchic charts of the Hellenistic period, going back beyond Dorotheus of Sidon. Also very important in the Introduction are the Lots,Late Classical Astrology, 2001, pp. 101–111ff. which were at the core of Hellenistic astrological technique,See Vettius Valens, The Anthology. Book III. [translated by Robert Schmidt and edited by Robert Hand.] Project Hindsight, Greek Track, Vol. VIII (The Golden Hind Press, Berkeley Springs, WV, 1994. although the scientifically minded Ptolemy avoids them. Paulus also discusses dodekatemoria and monomoiria, and gives an extensive treatment of sect in astrological analysis, and of the influence of planetary aspects as they apply and separate (the Hellenistic understanding of which is considerably at odds with modern practice.) At the time Paulus wrote, there was notable intellectual consolidation taking place in astrology. Forty years earlier, Julius Firmicus Maternus had written Mathesis, a long and very detailed summary of the astrological technique of his time, which has come down to us intact. Contemporaneous with Paulus, an anonymous writer had produced a Treatise on the Fixed Stars in 379 AD, which is our best record of how practical astrologers of the Roman period after Ptolemy dealt with stars in the context of the astrological chart; a few decades later came three books (Apotelesmatika) by the Egyptian Hephaistio of Thebes (415 AD) integrating Ptolemy with earlier traditions.  Legacy  In the several hundred years following Paulus and Hephaistio, there continued to be an active astrological tradition, some works of which have come down to us, including writings by Julian of Laodicea (c. 500 AD), Rhetorius (6th or 7th century), and, in the 5th or 6th century, Centiloquy (spuriously attributed for many centuries to Ptolemy), which exerted a very considerable influence on the astrological thinking of the Arabs and on European astrologers of the Medieval and Early Modern periods. (See: Lilly.) An important Indian astrological treatise called the Paulisa Siddhanta (\\"Doctrine of Paulus\\") is sometimes thought to be derived from the work of Paulus.Thomas McEvilley, The Shape of Ancient Thought: Comparative Studies in Greek and Indian Philosophies, Allworth Press, 2001, pg. 385. However, this notion has been rejected by other scholars in the field, notably by David Pingree who stated that \\"...the identification of Paulus Alexandrinus with the author of the Paulisasiddhanta is totally false\\".See David Pingree, The Yavanajataka of Sphujidhvaja, Vol. 2, Harvard Oriental Series, 1978, pgs. 437-438.

It succeeded Frank Leslie's Popular Monthly (1876–1904), Leslie's Monthly Magazine (1904–1905), Leslie's Magazine (1905) and the American Illustrated Magazine (1905–1906). The magazine was published through August 1956. History Under the magazine's original title, Frank Leslie's Popular Monthly, it had begun to be published in 1876 and was renamed Leslie's Monthly Magazine in 1904, and then was renamed again as Leslie's Magazine in 1905.Online Books Page, University of Pennsylvania From September 1905, through May 1906, it was entitled the American Illustrated Magazine; then subsequently shortened as The American Magazine until publication ceased in 1956. It kept continuous volume numbering throughout its history. In June 1906, muckraking journalists Ray Stannard Baker, Lincoln Steffens and Ida M. Tarbell left McClure's to help create The American Magazine. An \\"Editorial Announcement\\" published in 1907 lead with Tarbell's coverage of tariff policy. Baker contributed articles using the pseudonym David Grayson. Under John Sanborn Phillips, who served as editor until 1915, the monthly magazine departed somewhat from the muckraking style and focused on human interest stories, social issues and fiction. Initially published by his Phillips Publishing Company of Springfield, Ohio, it later was taken over by Crowell Publishing Company in 1911, and later merged with Collier's. The American Magazine was published by Crowell-Collier until it folded in 1956. Editors With the changes in 1915, John M. Siddall (1915–23) was appointed as editor of the periodical, which expanded its market considerably by concentrating on a female readership. The cover of the September 1917 issue announced: \\"This Magazine's Circulation Has Doubled in 20 Months.\\" The September 1922 cover stated circulation had reached 1.8 million. Merle Crowell served as editor of The American Magazine from 1923 until 1929 when Sumner Blossom took over. Blossom, who had been editor of Popular Science, was there for the last 27 years of the magazine's existence. Fictional serials and short stories were a popular feature, and the magazine published several winners of the O. Henry Awards. High-profile writers contributed articles on a variety of topics. During his editorship, Blossom adopted the unusual policy of hiding the author's name on all works of fiction during the selection process as a way to encourage new fiction writers. The magazine's staff learned the author's identity only once they accepted or rejected a manuscript. The last issue of The American Magazine was displayed on newsstands in August 1956. Stories In 1934, The American Magazine ran a story called \\"Uncle Sam Grows Younger\\" that praised Alger Hiss: \\"In his twenties, he is one of the men chiefly responsible for the plan to buy $650,000,000 worth of commodities to feed the unemployed.

History Terakoya, a private school in the Edo period The first terakoya made their appearance at the beginning of the 17th century, as a development from educational facilities founded in Buddhist temples. Before the Edo period, public educational institutions were dedicated to the children of samurai and ruling families, thus the rise of the merchant class in the middle of the Edo period boosted the popularity of terakoya, as they were widely common in large cities as Edo and Osaka, as well as in rural and coastal regions. The terakoya attendance rate reached 70% in the capital Edo at the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century. The terakoya were abolished in the Meiji period, when the government instituted the in 1872, when attending public schools was made compulsory to give basic education to the whole population. Curriculum Terakoya focused on reading and writing, but they dealt with extra subjects and disciplines, as counting with the abacus (soroban), history, and geography. They taught girls sewing, tea ceremony rituals, flower arranging techniques and other arts and crafts. The classes usually took place in private homes of samurai, Buddhist priests, or even commoner citizens. The instructors, called shishō () or te-narai-shishō () were mostly commoners, but samurai and Buddhist clergy also taught at terakoya. The administration tasks were often taken care of by the teachers themselves. A few terakoya were administered by Shinto priests and medical doctors. Unlike centers of popular education that taught mainly skills needed in everyday life, terakoya offered a higher level of education. The curriculum began with calligraphy courses, as pupils imitated their instructor examples, the so-called tehon (). Once the basics of writing were mastered, the pupils advanced to textbooks known as ōrai-mono (), which dated back to the Heian period and were mainly used for samurai education. These copybooks were compiled by Japanese men of letters and were written in kanji combined with kana. They contained useful information about the daily lives of people, as household precepts, conversation skills and moral values, as well as historical and geographical contents, which showed a wider scope of social life to the students. Although only a handful of terakoya offered commercial courses for the children of the merchant class, calculating with the abacus became more and more popular at the end of the Edo period. Through the system of terakoya and han schools, the Japanese population had achieved a high degree of literacy at the end of the Edo period. There are no reliable statistics, but it is estimated that 50% of men and 20% of women nationwide were literate and possessed basic calculation abilities.

Owned by the Manawatu County Council, it connected with the national railway network at Himatangi on the Foxton Branch. It was never part of the national network. Construction After the construction of a tramway (later upgraded to a railway) linking Foxton and Palmerston North, settlers north of Foxton began efforts to have a rail link built from to their settlements so they could easily access the port. In 1878 the Foxton and Sanson Railway Company was formed in order to build a line northwards from Himatangi (then named Carnarvon) to Sanson, and it envisaged that the line would become part of a trunk route from Wellington to the north.\\"The Proposed Foxton and Sanson Railway\\", Evening Post 17(399) 21 April 1879: 2. However, before construction began legislation was passed that made it appealing for the Manawatu County Council to build the line as a tramway and thereby qualify for subsidies. Work started from the Foxton line at Himatangi in 1882, and the line opened to Rongotea Siding on 23 August 1884, followed by Sanson, south- west of Feilding, on 16 November 1885. In 1902, a short extension beyond Sanson was opened to the southern bank of the Rangitikei River, opposite Bulls. Operation The Sanson Tramway was initially operated by the steam tram Hibernia from Wellington. It was not an adequate source of motive power, and a former Foxton locomotive from the days when the Foxton Branch was a tramway commenced work on the line by the time it was opened to Sanson. As traffic became more substantial, old locomotives were acquired from the national railway network to run on the tramway. As these locomotives were very light, they were just at home on a rural tramway as they had been on the nation's expanding network of railway lines before being displaced by more powerful and substantial engines. When Foxton locomotive depot closed and passenger services on the Foxton Branch were withdrawn in 1932, through running to Foxton from the tramway ceased. The line received a boost just before World War II when it was required to service contractors at the Ohakea RNZAF Base, and during the war petrol restrictions helped to generate traffic. These restrictions ended with the coming of peace and post-war traffic on the line was too insignificant to justify its continued existence. It closed on 29 November 1945.

It is located approximately northwest of Brandon and south from Russell. The community was originally formed around a stock farm established by the Scottish Ontario and Manitoba Land Company some three miles northwest of the current townsite. It was named after the Company founder's ancestral home in the Orkney Islands. When the Manitoba and Northwestern Railway (later CPR) was built through the area in 1886, the railway station was established at the current site of SE15-19-28W, and the community soon relocated itself there, incorporating as a village in 1917. In 2015, Binscarth amalgamated with the town of Russell and the Municipality of Russell to form the Municipality of Russell-Binscarth. The economic base of Binscarth and area is a mix of agriculture and service businesses. Major industrial employers in the area include three potash mines nearby in Saskatchewan (Nutrien Rocanville, Mosaic K1 Esterhazy and K2 Gerald) and a canola crushing plant (Bunge) at Harrowby Manitoba. Current NHL player Cody McLeod was born in Binscarth.  Major attractions  The Binscarth & District Gordon Orr Memorial Museum has a large collection of Native artifacts. The museum is also one of only a handful of museums to exhibit an extinct bison skull. Also on display is a Massey-Harris tractor, a binder, a seed drill, and a 6 H.P. International Engine dating from 1905. There is also a general store, summer kitchen, chapel, and school room. The museum is open in July and August. Binscarth is home to the \\"largest outdoor swimming pool on the Yellowhead highway\\". The pool, park and campground are located just south of the community in the Silver Creek valley.  Seekaywye  In 1964, Binscarth residents narrowly defeated (by ten votes) a proposal to rename itself Seekaywye, after the Winnipeg radio station CKY. If successful, the station would have promoted Binscarth/Seekaywye as a vacation resort. CKY also offered the same deal to La Riviere, Manitoba, who also said no.

It is referred to by the common names old man weed, being the literal translation of its Koori name gukwonderuk, common sneezeweed and scent weed which were given by European settlers but are increasingly falling out of use. The plant was used by indigenous Australians for its purported medicinal properties. It grows along the Murray River, or generally anywhere there is water, especially low lying or swampy areas. It can be identified by its unique shaped leaf and its pungent scent which is pine-like and minty.  Etymology  Centipeda is from the Greek word for one hundred feet The epithet cunninghamii honours Allan Cunningham (1791 – 1839), an English botanist and explorer, primarily known for his travels to Australia (New South Wales) and New Zealand to collect plants and author of Florae Insularum Novae Zelandiae Precursor, 1837-40 (Introduction to the flora of New Zealand).  Characteristics  Centipeda cunninghamii is an erect or ascending, endemic Australian perennial herb of the Daisy family (Asteraceae), glabrous or rarely woolly, about 20 cm (8 inches) high; stems much-branched. Leaves: Oblong to more less spathulate, they are about 15 mm (1/2 inch) long and 3–4 mm (1/10 inch) wide; margins shallowly toothed or subentire; narrowed to base but petiole indistinct. Inflorescence: Tiny green globular flowers, that can also be green, red/pink. Heads sessile, usually solitary, ± globose to biconvex, 4–8 mm (1/5 inch) in diameter; involucral bracts ± obovate, 2–3 mm long, apex obtuse, minutely toothed. Female florets usually 6–8-seriate. Bisexual florets 10–30. Fruit: Achenes clavate, about 2 mm long, apex rounded and glabrous above ribs.  Ecology  Flowering: mostly spring–autumn. September - February Fruiting: October - June Distribution and occurrence: Usually grows in damp areas subject to flooding, on a range of soil types. All subdivisions except NC; all mainland States, New Zealand. New South Wales subdivisions: CC, SC, NT, CT, ST, NWS, CWS, SWS, NWP, SWP, NFWP, SFWP Other Australian states: Qld Vic. Tas. W.A. S.A. N.T. Centipeda cunninghamii has also been encountered in Europe, most likely as a result of inadvertent introduction. Habitat: Coastal to montane (up to 600 m a.s.l.). Especially common in muddy/sility ground left by receding waters along lake, pond, stream and river margins. Also in muddy hollows within rough pasture, paddocks, tussock grassland, in damp depressions within dune swales and sometimes in similar sites within urban areas. Propagation Technique: Easily grown from fresh seed and cuttings. Inclined to become invasive. Traditional uses C. cunninghamii has a long history of traditional use by Australian Aboriginals for wounds, infections and inflammation. Traditional methods of use most commonly involve binding leaves of the plant directly to the forehead or other parts of the body, so that body heat may release the plants oils which are then absorbed into the skin. It may also be taken orally, sometimes mixing it with emu fat or boiling/soaking it in water to create a tea. In cases of oral ingestion, traditional medicinal authorities have cautioned to carefully regulate the dosage as the plant may be toxic if taken in large amounts.

Biography Greville was the cousin and adopted son of Fulke Greville, 1st Baron Brooke, and thus became the second Lord Brooke, and owner of Warwick Castle. He was born in 1607, and entered parliament for Warwick in 1628. He attended parliament and took part in some debates, but an investigation took place into his election for Warwick, and it was voided on 31 May 1628. Before a by-election could take place, Greville's adopted father died, on 30 September 1628, and Robert succeeded to the peerage that year, and thereafter was able to sit in the House of Lords. He was involved in the foundation of Saybrooke in Connecticut. cite Holmes, Annals of America, i. 229; Dugdale, Baronage, ii. 442; Cal. State Papers. Colonial, 1574–1660, pp. 122–123 Kupperman noted that Greville, in 1634, as a Charter Member of the Providence Island Company, \\"signified his willingness to take on the entire burden of funding, provided direction of the enterprise was wholly entrusted to him.\\" However, \\"John Pym led those who were unwilling to turn over their project entirely.\\", and the Providence Island colony was eventually overrun by Spanish treasure fleet in May 1641. Greville was imprisoned by Charles I at York in 1639 for refusing to take the oath to fight for the king, and soon became an active member of the parliamentary party; taking part in the Civil War he defeated the Royalists in a skirmish at Kineton in August 1642. During the Civil War, he commanded Parliament forces in Warwickshire and Staffordshire and was looked on by many as the Earl of Essex's eventual successor. In 1642 he gained the victory of Kineton. He took Stratford-upon- Avon in February, 1643 and was killed shortly afterwards besieging Lichfield Cathedral on 2 March. Greville was reportedly shot by a sniper (a concealed person who fired at Greville with a rifle) named John Dyott, a Deaf Man,https://libguides.gallaudet.edu/c.php?g=773975&p;=5552523 and many consider him to be the first recorded victim of sniper fire.

A member of the Democratic Party, she formerly served as the Speaker of the New York City Council. The third person to hold this office, she was the first female and first openly gay speaker.Chibbaro, Jr., Lou. \\"Most powerful\\" gay politician in the country, Washington Blade, January 20, 2006. Retrieved on 04-11-2007. She ran to succeed Michael Bloomberg as the city's mayor in the 2013 mayoral election, but lost the Democratic primary. Quinn is a political contributor on CNN and MSNBC. Early life, education, and early political career Quinn was born in Glen Cove, New York, one of two daughters of Mary (née Callaghan) and Lawrence Quinn. Her mother died of breast cancer in 1982. She attended School of the Holy Child in the village of Old Westbury on Long Island in New York, and graduated from Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut in 1988. Her maternal grandmother, Ellen (née Shine) Callaghan, was a survivor of the sinking of the RMS Titanic. She served as head of the Housing Justice Campaign for the Association of Neighborhood and Housing Development. Quinn entered politics to manage the City Council campaign of Thomas Duane in 1991, after which she served as Duane's chief of staff for five years. She later became the executive director of the New York City Anti- Violence Project, and was appointed a member of the NYC Police/Community Relations Task Force by then-Mayor Rudy Giuliani. New York City Council In a 1999 special election, Quinn ran for New York City Council in District Three. The 3rd district covers the Manhattan neighborhoods of Chelsea, Greenwich Village, and Hell's Kitchen, as well as parts of West Village, SoHo and Murray Hill. Quinn became the Democratic nominee and defeated Republican Joseph Mauriello, 89%-11%. In 2001 Quinn won a full term on the City Council, defeating Republican Michelle Bouchard 75%-25%. In 2005 she won reelection to her second full term unopposed. In 2009 she won reelection to her third full term with 81% of the vote. =Pre-speakership= While on the City Council, Quinn served as Chair of the Health Committee. She sponsored the Equal Benefits Bill and the Health Care Security Act, which requires that city contractors provide parity in benefits between married spouses and registered domestic partners. This bill (along with the Health Care Security Act, which ensures health care for grocery workers) passed over Mayor Michael Bloomberg's veto. Quinn also \\"shepherded\\" a ban on indoor smoking at commercial establishments through the City Council; the bill passed 42-7. =Speaker of the New York City Council= Quinn was elected Speaker of the New York City Council in January 2006 and reelected in 2010. She is the first female and first openly gay person to hold this position. Ahmadinejad visit Preceding the controversial lecture by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad at Columbia University in 2007, Quinn wrote to the school requesting that his invitation to speak be withdrawn due to his support of state-sponsored terrorism and hate speech, the latter particularly with regard to the Holocaust. Her request was denied. Controversy regarding Council funds Under New York City law, the City Council Speaker has authority over the yearly City Council funds, worth almost $400 million (in 2012), to distribute among 51 members. This discretionary funding system, sometimes called the \\"slush fund\\", has been criticized, with some councilmembers alleging Quinn to have cut funding to their districts as a form of political retaliation. She repeatedly denied these allegations. In April 2008 the New York Post reported that Quinn's office had appropriated millions of dollars to organizations that did not exist, and that the money was then secretly routed to organizations favored by individual councilmembers. In a news conference that followed Quinn said, \\"I had no knowledge of it; I did not know this was the practice\\". She said she had found out about it only a few months earlier, alerted authorities, and ordered staffers to stop the practice, but that they did not listen. Quinn hired a criminal defense lawyer to represent her in the federal and city investigations. Records showed that nearly 25% of those \\"secret slush\\" funds went to organizations in Quinn's district and that two of the biggest recipients had contributed to Quinn's 2009 mayoral run. In September 2011 one of the city council's lawyers reported that the federal \\"investigation has been closed without taking up any action,\\" but only after two councilmen were indicted at the cost of $100,000 to the City. Food stamps Under Quinn's leadership, the New York City Council led efforts to make Greenmarkets accept food stamps. She also opposed requiring applicants for food stamps to be electronically fingerprinted. New York State stopped fingerprinting food-stamp recipients in 2007, but the practice continued in New York City under the Bloomberg administration. Humanitarian efforts On December 26, 2012, Quinn wrote a letter to President Obama formally requesting that he commute Jonathan Pollard's lifetime sentence for providing classified information to Israel. She wrote, \\"I know I share similar views with many past and current American elected officials,\\" and asked Obama to \\"use [his] constitutional power to treat Mr. Pollard the way others have been treated by our nation's justice system.\\" LGBT issues Quinn was a vigorous LGBT advocate during her tenure on the City Council. In 2006 she boycotted the annual St. Patrick's Day Parade in New York due to the policy of the parade's sponsor, the Ancient Order of Hibernians, against gays marching openly. The same year she tried unsuccessfully to broker a deal with the organizers to allow her to wear a gay pride pin. Subsequently, she was named 2008 Irish-American of the Year by the New York-based Irish Echo and has boycotted the parade every year since, marching instead in St. Patrick's Day parades in other cities around the world. In November 2009 Quinn urged the New York Senate to pass same-sex marriage legislation, saying that \\"she and her partner, lawyer Kim Catullo, [would] not get married until they [could do so] in New York. Near tears, she added: 'This is literally a moment when people can stand up and say that everybody's family matters, that everybody's home is a blessed place and that everybody has the same rights.'\\" On July 28, 2012, Quinn sent a letter demanding that the president of NYU end its relationship with Chick-Fil-A, because of the stance of the company's CEO, Dan Cathy, against same-sex marriage. Term limits According to New York, \\"[for] years, Quinn opposed term limits, a position that helped her get elected speaker by fellow Council members in 2005. Once in the job, though, she commissioned a poll, and it showed that the public opposed tinkering with them. In December 2007, Quinn declared that repealing term limits would be 'anti-democratic,' a position she called 'firm and final.'\\" But in 2008 Quinn backed Mayor Michael Bloomberg's effort to overturn the two-term limit for New York City elected officials, saying she had changed her position due to concern about the impact a change in leadership could have on the city's economic recovery. In 2008 the Council voted to extend term limits to allow the mayor, City Council members, and borough presidents to run for third terms, reversing the results of the two previous public referenda. Bloomberg was subsequently elected to a third term as mayor, and Quinn to a third term on the City Council. Public Advocate Betsy Gotbaum, among others, denounced this move. In June 2009 the City Council approved a 40% cut in the budget of the Public Advocate's Office. Gotbaum declared herself a victim of \\"political payback\\" because of her opposition to the changes in the term limits law, a notion Quinn claimed was \\"ridiculous\\". All five candidates for Public Advocate showed up at City Hall in June to protest the move, and in 2010 New Yorkers again voted overwhelmingly to limit politicians to two consecutive terms. 2013 mayoral election On March 10, 2013, after much speculation, Quinn announced that she was running for mayor of New York City. (Michael Bloomberg, the incumbent, was term-limited and could not run again.) Widely viewed as Bloomberg's heir apparent, Quinn was considered the early frontrunner in the nine-candidate race for the Democratic nomination. During her mayoral campaign, multiple media outlets reported on Quinn's temper; The New York Times reported that her staff had her City Council office soundproofed due to her outbursts. Quinn's rivals attacked her for reversing her position on mayoral term limits and supporting Bloomberg's bid for a third term in 2009. In August 2013 The Washington Post opined that Quinn's primary chances were damaged by Bloomberg's \\"tacit endorsement\\" of her campaign, and in September The New York Times asserted that her change in position on term limits had also harmed her chances. Quinn's campaign faded as time went on, and she finished third in the primary. She received 15.5% of the vote, while winner Bill de Blasio received 40.3% and Bill Thompson 26.2%. Post-council activities In 2013 Quinn's memoir, With Patience and Fortitude A Memoir, was published by William Morrow. It sold poorly, with The New York Times reporting only 100 copies sold its first week. In October 2014 Quinn stumped for the Women's Equality Party established by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo in July 2014. When asked about the Working Families Party's criticism of the creation of a competing progressive party, she said, \\"Change is hard.\\" In January 2015 Cuomo hired Quinn as a special advisor. In 2015, Quinn became president and CEO of Women in Need (WIN), a nonprofit organization that is one of New York City's largest providers of services to homeless women and children.West, Melanie Grayce (02/26/2016).

Quinn made headlines in 2018 for her comments about Cynthia Nixon's campaign for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. Referring to her own 2013 mayoral candidacy, Quinn said, \\"Cynthia Nixon was opposed to having a qualified lesbian become mayor of New York City\\", and added, \\"Now she wants to be an unqualified lesbian to be the governor of New York. [Being] an actress and celebrity doesn’t make you qualified for public office\\". In 2019, Quinn and WIN drew criticism from the press (including a masthead editorial in The New York Daily News) for two contracts to operate homeless shelters in South Park Slope, Brooklyn. The allegations, verified by multiple journalists, included that the contracts contained up to $89 million of unexplained and apparently inflated costs. WIN and Quinn repeatedly declined to comment when asked for an explanation of the cost. Personal life Quinn resides in Chelsea, Manhattan, with her wife, Kim Catullo, a lawyer. The couple married on May 19, 2012, and spend their summer weekends at a home they purchased in 2004 in Bradley Beach, New Jersey. Her former partner, Laura Morrison, was chief of staff to former State Senator Thomas Duane. She joined the board of Athlete Ally, an organization fighting homophobia in sports, in February 2014.\\"EXCLUSIVE: Former Speaker Christine Quinn joins board of nonprofit for gay athletes\\".

He established his own business in Saint Petersburg, which his son inherited. Life and career Gustav Fabergé, a Baltic German, was born in the city of Pernau (now Pärnu) in Livonia (present-day Estonia) on 18 February 1814. His father, the artisan Pierre Favry (1768–1858; later Fabrier), moved to the Baltic province of Livonia, then part of the Russian Empire. Pierre had moved there by 1800 from the German city of Schwedt an der Oder. He married a Silesian merchant’s daughter named Maria Louisa Elsner (1776–1855). His family were Huguenots from Picardy living in Germany, having fled religious persecution in France at the end of the 17th century, after the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes. In 1796, he registered as a master joiner in Pärnu under the names of Peter Fabrier in 1796 and Peter Faberg in 1808. Their son Gustav was born in Pärnu, where he adopted the surname of Faberge in 1828. Gustav was apprenticed to Andreas Ferdinand Spiegel in St Petersburg. He then worked for Johann Wilhelm Keibel in the 1830s. Gustav qualified as a master in 1841. In 1842, he opened the jewellery firm House of Fabergé in St Petersburg and married Charlotte Maria Fabergé (born Jungstedt), the daughter of a Danish artist. He employed Johann Alexander Gunst, Johann Eckhardt and from 1857 August Wilhelm Holmström.http://www.beyars.com/kunstlexikon/lexikon_2707.htm Peter Carl Fabergé was initially educated in St Petersburg. In 1860, Gustav Fabergé retired and, together with his wife and son, moved to Dresden, leaving the business in the hands of Peter Hiskias Pending and V. A. Zaianchkovski. In Dresden, they lived at Walpurgisstraße and Victoriastraße, a few minutes’ walk from the Castle and the famous jewellery collection Grünes Gewölbe, with the important jewellery of Johann Melchior Dinglinger. Peter Carl continued his education in Dresden. A second son, Agathon, was born to the couple two years later. In 1864, Peter Carl Fabergé embarked upon a Grand Tour of Europe. He received tuition from respected goldsmiths in Germany, France and England, attended a course at Schloss’s Commercial College in Paris, and viewed the objects in the galleries of Europe’s leading museums. He returned to St Petersburg and married Augusta Julia Jacobs. For the following ten years, his father's trusted work master Peter Hiskias Pendin acted as his mentor and tutor. Upon Pendin's death in 1882, Peter Carl took over the business and was joined by his brother Agathon Fabergé. Gustav Fabergé lived in Dresden with his wife until she passed away in 1893. He died on 3 January 1894, aged 79, and was cremated in Gotha with his ashes buried next to his wife’s remains at Trinitatisfriedhof (Trinity Cemetery) in Dresden.

Leo von Klenze (Franz Karl Leopold von Klenze; 29 February 1784, Buchladen (Bockelah / Bocla) near Schladen – 26 January 1864, Munich) was a German neoclassicist architect, painter and writer. Court architect of Bavarian King Ludwig I, Leo von Klenze was one of the most prominent representatives of Greek revival style. Biography Von Klenze studied architecture and public building finance under Friedrich Gilly in Berlin, and worked as an apprentice to Charles Percier and Pierre François Léonard Fontaine in Paris. Between 1808 and 1813 he was a court architect of Jérôme Bonaparte, King of Westphalia. Later he moved to Bavaria and in 1816 began to work as court architect of Ludwig I. The King's passion for Hellenism shaped the architectural style of von Klenze. He built many neoclassical buildings in Munich, including the Ruhmeshalle and Monopteros temple. On Königsplatz he designed probably the best known modern Hellenistic architectural ensemble. Near Regensburg he built the Walhalla temple, named after Valhalla, the home of gods in Norse mythology. When Greece won its independence, Ludwig I's son Otto became the country's first king. Von Klenze was invited to Athens to submit plans of city reconstruction in the style of Ancient Greece. Russian Emperor Nicholas I commissioned von Klenze in 1838 to design a building for the New Hermitage, a public museum that housed the Romanov collection of antiquities, paintings, coins and medals, cameos, prints and drawings, and books. Prior to this, von Klenze had also designed and arranged museum galleries in Munich, including the Glyptothek, Ludwig I's museum for antique sculpture, and the Alte Pinakothek, a painting gallery for the pictures of the Wittelsbach collection. Von Klenze was not only an architect, but also an accomplished painter and draughtsman. In many of his paintings ancient buildings were depicted. Those served as models for his own architectural projects. Klenze studied ancient architecture during his travels to Italy and Greece. He also participated in excavations of ancient buildings in Athens and submitted proposals for the restoration of the Acropolis. Klenze collected works of important contemporary German painters. He sold his collection, including 58 landscapes and genre paintings, to King Ludwig I in 1841. These paintings form the core of the Neue Pinakothek museum's collection. Von Klenze married Maria Felicitas Blangini (1790–1844) a beauty at the court of Ludwig I. Their granddaughter Irene Athenais von Klenze became Countess Courten (1850–1916). Von Klenze died in 1864 and was buried in the Alter Südfriedhof in Munich.

Accessed February 27, 2011. From a literary family, she wrote five novels. Her first and best known, The Helmet of Navarre, was made into a Broadway play. Early years Her father died when she was nine, at which time she and her mother moved to New York City. She grew up in a literary family. Her father, Cornelius A. Runkle (1833–1888),NYT (Mar.20, 1888) had been a respected New York lawyer who had served as legal counsel for the New York Tribune where her mother, Lucia (Gilbert) Runkle, had worked as an editorial writer and who was reportedly the first American woman to be on the staff of a major metropolitan daily newspaper. Later, she wrote for the Christian Union, later The Outlook, and for ten years Mrs. Runkle was the literary adviser of Harper & Brothers, her work including French and German manuscripts and books, as well as English. In 1893, she undertook, with Charles Dudley Warner, the enormous labor which is represented in the thirty volumes of Library of the World's Best Literature.Warner et al. (1897) Library of the World's Best Literature It was quite by chance that Mrs. Runkle one day came upon a poem of her daughter's which she was anxious to have judged on its merits by that keen critic, the editor-in-chief. With no clue to the authorship, he was delighted with its strength, its unusual form, and the splendid swing of the lines. The poem was at once ordered into \\"The World's Best Literature,\\" and Edmund Clarence Stedman afterward included it in his American Anthology. So good rank did Runkle's work take in the judgment of two eminent critics, when she was hardly more than a school-girl, that she was sent to Miss Bracket's school, a fashionable girls' boarding school in New York, till she was thirteen, when she was taken away because of delicate health. From that time she was schooled in the large home library, and studied with her mother. From an early age, she kept a notebook in which she wrote stories. When she tired of one, she would leave it unfinished and begin another, thus becoming accustomed to what in the professional world is the life of a writer. In 1893, her mother purchased a small piece of land at Onteora, Tannersville, New York, and upon it built a house where she and her daughter lived every summer. Here she taught herself how to write a successful novel, and also how to play golf and tennis, becoming an avid player of both. Career =The Helmet of Navarre= Bertha Runkle was only twenty-one years old when her book The Helmet of Navarre was first serialized in The Century Magazine. She had the story in her mind for two years or so, and the actual writing took about four months. The title was taken from a passage in Thomas Babbington Macaulay's poem Ivry, which its author adopted as a motto: > \\"Press where ye see my white plume shine amidst the ranks of war, > \\"And be your oriflamme today, the helmet of Navarre.\\"Thomas Babington > Macaulay (1847) Lays of ancient Rome, Longman, London ) Its first form was much shorter, and it was a tale of political intrigue and martial adventure, without a heroine. But the editor of The Century Company insisted that a spoiled public would not be content without \\"the swish of the petticoats\\" and a dozen more chapters were called for, which she supplied. The magazine serialization had been so well received that 100,000 copies were printed for the first edition of the book.Bookseller, Vol.7 (1902) The book went on to become No. 3 on the list of bestselling novels in the United States for the entire year of 1901 as determined by The New York Times. The year of its release, she teamed up with playwright Lawrence Marston to adapt her story to the Broadway stage in a production by Charles Frohman. =The Truth About Tolna= The magazine for which her mother had written, The Outlook, had the following to say about Runkle's second novel, The Truth About Tolna. > \\"The young lady who achieved popularity at a single stroke, Miss Bertha > Runkle, has written of an American fortnight almost as crowded with events > as were those few amazing days in The Helmet of Navarre. There are a dash > and vigor about the handling of this novel of modern New York life that will > carry it, perhaps, beyond its real merits.

The mandarinfish is native to the Pacific, ranging approximately from the Ryukyu Islands south to Australia. It can usually be found in some of the warmer waters.  Taxonomy and etymology  The mandarinfish was first described as Callionymus splendidus in 1927 by Albert William Herre, an American ichthyologist working in the Philippines. It was later placed in genus Synchiropus. The generic name Synchiropus is from Ancient Greek syn-, meaning \\"together\\", and -chiropus meaning \\"hand-foot\\". The specific epithet splendidus is from the Latin for 'bright' or 'glittering.'Perseus & Tufts: Latin Word Study Tool Lewis & Short (1879) The common name of the mandarinfish comes from its extremely vivid colouration, evoking the robes of an Imperial Chinese mandarin. Other common names include mandarin goby, green mandarin, striped mandarinfish, striped dragonet, green dragonet and sometimes psychedelic mandarinfish. The similarly named mandarin fish (Siniperca chuatsi), properly known as the Chinese perch, is distantly related. The mandarinfish belongs to the perciform family Callionymidae, the dragonets, which counts 10 genera and more than 182 species. Genus Synchiropus counts 51 species, divided into 10 subgenera. The mandarinfish is in subgenus Synchiropus (Pterosynchiropus) along with the S. occidentalis and S. picturatus.  Description  Green mandarin in a reef aquarium The mandarinfish viewed from the front S. splendidus is one of only two vertebrate species known to have blue colouring because of cellular pigment, the other being the closely related psychedelic mandarin (S. picturatus). The name \\"cyanophore\\" was proposed for the blue chromatophores, or pigment-containing and light-reflecting cells. In all other known cases, the colour blue is structural, as it comes from thin-film interference from piles of flat, thin and reflecting purine crystals. The mandarinfish has a body shape similar to a goby, though this is the only resemblance between the two. The vivid coloration sports a bright blue background, with swirly orange stripes and a blue-greenish face with bold blue stripes. The large pelvic fins are used for 'walking' on the seafloor and are often mistakenly seen as the pectoral fins. The real pectorals are located almost at the center and are nearly transparent, with a tinge of fin, the anal fins and on part of the tail, the rest of which is striped in vibrant orange and blue. The dorsal fin, which is exceptionally tall in males, has a striking orange-and blue design as well. The eyes are usually red with black pupils. Different varieties sport different markings and colors. The green mandarin is the fish that has been described. The red mandarin is the same species, but its pelvic fins and what would be orange is red. In some rare cases, the entire dragonet is red with black stripes. The spotted mandarin is light gray-green with black, pink and blue spots. Mandarinfish are reef dwellers, preferring sheltered lagoons and inshore reefs. While they are slow-moving and fairly common within their range, they are not easily seen due to their bottom-feeding habit and their small size (reaching only about 6 cm). They feed primarily on small crustaceans and other invertebrates. = Diet = Based on the gut analyses of seven wild fish Sadovy et al. (2001) determined that the mandarinfish has a mixed diet that consists of harpacticoid copepods, polychaete worms, small gastropods, gammaridean amphipods, fish eggs and ostracods. In the wild, feeding is continuous during daytime; the fish peck selectively at small prey trapped on coral substrate in a home range of many square meters.  Relationship to humans  Despite their popularity in the aquarium trade, mandarinfish are considered difficult to keep, as their feeding habits are very specific. Some fish never adapt to aquarium life, refusing to eat anything but live amphipods and copepods (as in the wild); though individuals that do acclimatize to aquarium food are considered to be quite hardy and highly resistant to diseases such as marine ich. They are less likely to contract marine ich because they do not have the typical skin type that is affected by this disease. Mandarinfish also have a layer of debatably smelly and bitter slime instead of scales, which blocks out disease and probably also discourages predators, implying their bright coloration is aposematic. The mandarinfish appeared on a 39-kip postage stamp from Laos issued in 1987, and a 40-cent postage stamp of the Federated States of Micronesia issued on 26 August 1993.

In 1961, she published The Burial, her first novel, at the age of 23. Lash was regarded as one of the most promising young people among England's artists at the time. Upon meeting Lash in Suffolk, Dodie Smith, who wrote The Hundred and One Dalmatians, remarked that Lash was \\"almost too interesting to be true\\". Life and career Lash was born at Chichester, Sussex on 27 February 1938, the daughter of Joan Mary (née Moore) and Brigadier Henry Alleyne Lash. Lash lived in India, where her father was stationed, until the age of 6. Her uncle Bill Lash was the Bishop of Bombay from 1947 to 1961. When her family returned to England, they settled in Surrey. Raised a Roman Catholic, Lash attended boarding school at the Convent of the Sacred Heart in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, and continued on to Farnham Art School. When she was 16 years old, her studies were cut short by family problems. She discontinued her education and moved to London where she supported herself with odd jobs to support her artistic pursuits. In the mid-1950s, she met the lyric poet and gallery owner Iris Birtwistle in Churt, Surrey, where they were both living. Shortly afterwards, when Birtwistle moved to Walberswick, Suffolk, Lash went with her and, encouraged by Birtwistle, began work on her first novel, The Burial. Birtwistle renamed Lash \\"Jini\\" and introduced her to her future husband Mark Fiennes, whom she married in 1962, the year in which her second book The Climate of Belief was published. There were seven children of the marriage: actors Ralph Fiennes and Joseph Fiennes, film makers Martha Fiennes and Sophie Fiennes, composer Magnus Fiennes, Jacob Fiennes, a conservation manager, and foster son Michael Emery, an archaeologist. The family frequently relocated and lived in Suffolk, Wiltshire, Ireland and London. Lash wrote four more novels over the next 20 years: The Prism (1963), Get Down There and Die (1977), The Dust Collector (1979) and From May to October (1980). Lash's paintings were featured in several exhibitions in The Penwith Galleries in St Ives, The Halesworth Gallery and Westleton Chapel Gallery in Suffolk. In the late 1980s, Lash was diagnosed with breast cancer. While in remission from the disease, she traveled to Lourdes and Saintes Maries de la Mer in France and to Spain's sacred Santiago de Compostella. During this time, she wrote On Pilgrimage, her only non-fiction book. Lash died on 28 December 1993 at Odstock, Wiltshire, aged 55. Her final novel, Blood Ties, was published posthumously in 1997.

Her work in Ethiopia in 1984 inspired Band Aid and subsequently Live Aid, the biggest relief programme ever mounted. Bertschinger received the Florence Nightingale Medal in 1991 for her work in nursing, and was made a Dame by Queen Elizabeth II in 2010 for \\"services to Nursing and to International Humanitarian Aid\\". Biography The daughter of a Swiss father and British mother, Bertschinger was brought up in Sheering near Bishop's Stortford, Essex. Dyslexic, she could barely read or write until she was 14. After her parents got a television in the 1960s, one of the first films she watched was The Inn of the Sixth Happiness starring Ingrid Bergman playing the role of Gladys Aylward, an English missionary to China in the 1930s who is caught up in the Japanese invasion. Bertschinger thought: “I could do that. That's what I want to do.” She graduated from Brunel University with an MSc degree in Medical Anthropology in 1997. Bertschinger is a Buddhist, practising Nichiren Buddhism. She became a member of the global Buddhist organization Soka Gakkai International in 1994. Her autobiographical book, Moving Mountains, was published in 2005. The book describes her global experiences and her spiritual motivation that led her to Buddhism. Part of the royalties from the book go to The African Children's Educational Trust, a British charity. =Career= After training and working as a nurse in the UK, Bertschinger became a medic on Operation Drake, an expedition with Colonel John Blashford-Snell and the Scientific Exploration Society in Panama, Papua New Guinea and Sulawesi. After this experience, she joined the emergency disaster relief group of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), allowed to attend war locations thanks to her dual-nationality. Through this she has worked in over a dozen zones of conflict including Afghanistan, Kenya, Lebanon, Sudan, Sierra Leone, Ivory Coast and Liberia. She also worked at ICRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland as training officer in the Health Division. Bertschinger is an ambassador and Trustee for The African Children's Educational Trust, Patron for Promise Nepal, and a voluntary worker for the charity Age UK. In 2010, Bertschinger was honoured as Dame Commander of British Empire by the Queen Elizabeth II in the New Year Honours List, for services to Nursing and to International Humanitarian Aid. Bertschinger was made a Deputy Lieutenant of Hertfordshire in 2012. As of 2016, she is Director for the Diploma in Tropical Nursing course at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. =Ethiopia= In 1984, Bertschinger was working as an ICRC field nurse located in Mekele, the capital of Tigray Province, Ethiopia during the famine of 1984. She ran a feeding centre that could only accept 60 to 70 new children at a time when thousands more were in need of food. As a young nurse, she had to decide who would and would not receive food. Those she couldn't help had little hope of survival, and when interviewed about the pain of having to make such critical decisions, she said \\"I felt like a Nazi commandant, deciding who would live and who would die. Playing God broke my heart.\\" When a BBC News crew appeared with reporter Michael Buerk, Bertschinger gladly told her story to highlight the problems. While Buerk thought Bertschinger was a hero, and edited his report to highlight this, Bertschinger humorously admitted that her first impression of Buerk was that of an arrogant prat who asked irrelevant questions. However, she soon became convinced of the value of media exposure for charities. \\"I don't think charities fully take advantage because a lot of them don't want to spend money on professionals to represent them, or they don't know how to present themselves,\\" she later said. Buerk's initial news report on Bertschinger's work, which was broadcast on 23 October 1984, inspired the watching Bob Geldof to launch Band Aid. This was followed by Live Aid in 1985, the biggest relief programme ever mounted, which raised more than £150m and saved an estimated 2m lives in Africa. In 2004, Bertschinger returned to Ethiopia with Buerk, to assess the situation 20 years on to make the programme Ethiopia: A Journey with Michael Buerk. After that visit, Bertschinger said \\"Education is the key to the future for resource-poor settings. It opens doors and it radically improves people's health, particularly for women.\\" Awards * 1986: Bish Medal from the Scientific Exploration Society. * 1991: Florence Nightingale Medal from the International Committee of the Red Cross. * 2005: Women of the Year, Window to the World Award. * 2007: Human Rights and Nursing Awards 2007, from the International Centre for Nursing Ethics (ICNE), in the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences at the University of Surrey. * 2008: Honorary degree of Doctor of Social Sciences, Brunel University. * 2010: Voted one of the Top 20 Most Influential People in the Nursing Field by Masters in Nursing Online. * 2010: Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2010 New Year Honours. * 2010: Honorary degree of Doctor of Education, Robert Gordon University. * 2010: Honorary degree of Doctor of Health Sciences, Anglia Ruskin University. * 2011: Honorary degree of Doctor of Staffordshire University. * 2011: Honorary degree of Doctor of Science, De Montfort University. * 2012: Voted one of the Five formidable women who shaped the Red Cross by the British Red Cross. * 2012: Voted one of The 10 most influential female nurses of all time by Scrubs Magazine. * 2012: Deputy Lieutenant of Hertfordshire.

The full game was first released on August 17, 2003, at Comiket 64. Gameplay Screenshot of stage 5 Perfect Cherry Blossom features three different playable characters to choose from, with two different attack types each. Reimu Hakurei has the smallest hitbox, and homing projectiles, but weaker bullets. Marisa Kirisame is the fastest character, and has a lower boundary to collect all items onscreen, but has a narrow attack range. Sakuya Izayoi has the largest area in which she can graze enemy bullets, a lower Cherry point penalty for dying, and can attack over an even larger area than Reimu. The largest change Perfect Cherry Blossom introduces over its predecessor Embodiment of Scarlet Devil is the addition of the \\"Cherry\\" scoring system. Almost every part of the game is linked with the \\"Cherry Meter\\": shooting enemies increases Cherry points, bombing or dying decreases Cherry points, and reaching 50,000 Cherry points gives the player a temporary shield. The higher the Cherry Meter becomes, the more points the player can gain from Point Items. Other important gameplay changes introduced in Perfect Cherry Blossom are the appearance of the player character's hitbox while being focused (by holding the Shift key), a change in the properties of the player's attacks depending on whether the player is normal or focused, and a cursor on the bottom margin of the screen during a boss battle which tells the player where the boss is currently located. Exclusive to Perfect Cherry Blossom, there is a \\"Phantasm Stage\\" after the \\"Extra Stage\\", which is a harder version of the Extra Stage and contains the conclusion to the game's story. Plot In the spring of the 119th season, the Spring Snow Incident (春雪異変) . Gensokyo was in an eternal winter, which had showed no sign of falter, with snowstorms happening in May. The three heroines, each for their own reasons, set out to do something about the extended winter. Depending on who the player chooses, only one of these three heroines actually goes out and investigates. Canonically, Reimu is the one that resolves this incident. Reaching above the clouds from where the cherry blossoms fall, the heroine enters the gate of the Netherworld (冥界). There she is confronted by half-ghost gardener Youmu Konpaku. Youmu explains that she had been stealing the essence of spring throughout Gensokyo in order to make the Saigyō Ayakashi (西行妖), a youkai cherry tree, bloom perfectly under orders from her mistress, Yuyuko Saigyouji. The heroine defeats Youmu and hurries to Hakugyokurō (白玉楼), where the tree is, to get Gensokyo's spring back. There the ghost princess of Hakugyokurō, Yuyuko, reveals that she had an interest in a corpse sleeping beneath the Saigyou Ayakashi from before her existence. In order to break the seal, the youkai cherry blossom tree needed to bloom fully. Yuyuko and the heroine fight to get the last \\"spring\\" contained in the heroine needed for the Perfect Cherry Blossom, and to reclaim Gensokyo's spring. After the heroine defeats Yuyuko, the Saigyou Ayakashi starts to lose its health. However, the seal has been weakened from the near-complete bloom, and the sealed soul is temporarily unleashed. The soul is revealed to be Yuyuko's, and the heroine fights her a second time, until Yuyuko's soul is finally sealed. As a result of the Spring Snow Incident, since the arrival of spring was late, the hanami season became short, and was also the trigger for the incident orchestrated by Suika Ibuki in Immaterial and Missing Power. A few days later, Yuyuko asks the heroine for a favour. The magic boundary between Gensokyo and the Netherworld was weakened by Yukari Yakumo, one of Yuyuko's friends, to make stealing Gensokyo's spring easier, which resulted in many yuurei being seen in Gensokyo. Yuyuko asks the heroine to find her friend, who would be preparing for the flower-viewing event during this time, and remind her to repair the boundary. The Extra Mode tells of the heroine's effort in trying to find Yukari. Instead, the heroine meets Chen, the stage 2 boss, again. It is revealed that Chen was the shikigami of Ran Yakumo, and an angry Ran comes to fight the heroine after Chen is defeated again. Ran reveals that she is also a shikigami, and that she will not let any troublemakers disturb her master. The heroine figures that defeating Ran will get the attention of Yuyuko's friend, and ultimately defeats Ran. Surprisingly, Ran's master, Yukari, does not appear, and Ran tells the heroine that she should try coming back at night, since her master sleeps less often during the night. In the Phantasm Mode, the heroine returns that night and defeats a weakened Ran again, after which Yukari finally emerges to greet the heroine. Yukari is quite surprised at the heroine's ability and decides to continue where Ran left off. Yukari is defeated, and quickly uses her abilities to do the heroine's request. However, as this was not resolved and continues for a time, Youmu went to Gensokyo with and gathered back the yuurei with a hitodama light. Characters ;Playable characters *Reimu Hakurei (博麗 霊夢) – The shrine maiden of the Hakurei Shrine, she is tired of the perpetual coldness and wants to find the source of this unnatural weather. She attacks with homing amulets and needles. *Marisa Kirisame (霧雨 魔理沙) – A black-clothed magician, she sees a cherry blossom petal float down outside her house in the Forest of Magic and wonders if spring is happening somewhere else. She attacks with magic missiles and lasers. *Sakuya Izayoi (十六夜 咲夜) – The head maid of the Scarlet Devil Mansion, she knows that their winter supplies are diminishing quickly, and wants to end the prolonged winter before they run out completely. She attacks with homing knives and misdirected knives. ;Boss characters * – Returning from stage 2 of Embodiment of Scarlet Devil, Cirno is now a mid-boss of the first stage in Perfect Cherry Blossom. She still uses icicle-based attacks, but she has no dialogue in this game. * – Stage one boss and midboss, Letty is a type of yuki-onna who is only active during the winter. Mistaken for the mastermind behind the unending winter, she was attacked by the heroines. She possesses an ability to manipulate chilliness—since this is equivalent to an ability that manipulates the winter within nature, she possesses tremendous power according to the environment, but she ismostly powerless outside of winter. Outside of winter, she hides away in a place where not a ray of sunlight can reach. * – Stage two boss,midboss and Extra Stage mid-boss. A cat keeping watch in the lost village of Mayohiga, Chen is a shikigami of Ran Yakumo, who bestowed her with the powers of sorcery. Chen, as a bakeneko, acquires powers of a wrathful god while possessed, but since Ran is also a shikigami, her ability is fairly low. This shikigami possession is removed when she is soaked in water, and since she also hates water as a cat, she is in any case weak to water. * – Returning from Mystic Square, the redesigned Alice is the third stage midboss twice and also the stage boss. She is a magician who uses puppetry, a departure from her old magic-styled attacks. She has blond hair and has pale skin, and at one glance she has the appearance of a doll. With a personality that is indifferent to other people, she is attached to magic, and is usually confident but can also be timid.『萃夢想』付属の「上海アリス通信.txt」 Originally a human, she became a yōkai magician upon completion of some training. It has not been long since the day she has become a magician, and because of this, she still continues human habits like eating and sleeping that became unnecessary. She has a residence in the Forest of Magic, and perhaps due to her being originally human, she gladly gives shelter to those lost in the forest. Normally aloof, she unexpectedly likes to duel others with spell cards. * – The mid-boss of stage four. A fairy that heralds the arrival of spring with barrages of bullets. She is the first midboss to receive an official character profile. * – Bosses of stage 4. They are poltergeists in the shape of three sisters. They were originally daughters of a human noble, but an unfortunate event caused his four daughters to separate. The fourth daughter, Layla Prismriver, was unable to leave the mansion that held so many of her memories. Using her power, she conjured poltergeists with the appearance of her older sisters, then slowly became forgotten along with the mansion and the poltergeists. Even though the humans died with the passage of time, the poltergeists continue their noisy lives in that mansion to this day. The three Prismriver Sisters, now musical performers of some note, were employed by Yuyuko Saigyouji to provide entertainment for the upcoming flower-viewing. The protagonists encounter them at the gate to the netherworld. ** – The main stage four boss when playing as Reimu. The eldest of the Prismriver Sisters. She plays the violin and prefers solo performances. Honest to a fault, she is perhaps the most well-adjusted of the sisters. ** – The main stage four boss when playing as Sakuya. The middle child of the Prismriver Sisters. She plays the trumpet. Her magic is the strongest of the three sisters, but her technique is not very good. Despite this, she is cheerful and tends to obsess over things. ** – The main stage four boss when playing as Marisa. The youngest of the poltergeist Prismriver Sisters. Although skilled with all instruments, she prefers keyboard and percussion. She is clever and manipulative, usually goading her older sisters into doing her fighting rather than engaging in battle herself. * – The stage five mid-boss and boss as well as the stage six mid-boss, a subordinate of Yuyuko who tends her garden. With her supreme concentration, her sword slashes can appear to slow time or blink at an instant. As she is a mixture of human and yūrei, she has a half-human half-yokai existence, and the large yūrei that always follows her is the yūrei half of her body. As she has a straightforward diligent personality, she is often manipulated by those around her (especially Yuyuko). * – Final boss, the ghostly princess of the netherworld pagoda, Hakugyokurō, who unwittingly lures her victims to their deaths. This ability of hers when she was still a living human caused her to eventually commit suicide using her life to seal away an ancient evil residing in a youkai cherry blossom tree. Yuyuko, at first appearance, is a ditz; her mental processes seem to be dedicated mainly to teasing her gardener and servant, Youmu, and anticipating her next meal. However, her usual manner conceals a sharp mind and an almost preternatural depth of insight. Her danmaku are characterized by butterfly-shaped bullets. * – Extra stage boss and Phantasm stage midboss. A nine-tailed fox yōkai whom Yukari Yakumo made her shikigami. She is considerably powerful even without her master's support; among other things, she uses this power to maintain her own shikigami, Chen. Since Yukari sleeps twelve hours a day, she handles the work during these times, hence she fights the heroines in the game before Yukari wakes up. * – Boss of the Phantasm Stage after the Extra Stage. An ancient youkai being who has control over the boundaries of all things, both physical and metaphorical. She is a good friend of Yuyuko and is the self- appointed stewardess of the seal between Gensokyo and the outside world. However, she is asleep most of the time, leaving all the work to her shikigami Ran and Ran's shikigami Chen. When she is not, she tends to amuse herself by pulling in unprepared humans from the outside world and stranding them in Gensokyo. A very irresponsible yōkai. Her calculation and mathematical skills far exceeds that of Ran. Release history The first demo of Perfect Cherry Blossom was released at the 63rd Comiket on December 30, 2002. Another demo with only the MIDI soundtrack was released freely online on January 26, 2003. The final version was released on August 17, 2003, in the 64th Comiket, while distribution in doujin shops started on September 7 of that year. ZUN, the only member of Team Shanghai Alice, made another version of the game for the first Reitaisai, held on April 18, 2004, where a score attack tournament was held. This version features changed dialogue and background music for the Phantasm stage. The new track is included in the doujin CD by Sound Sepher.sound sepher 1st Album 「Cradle - 東方幻樂祀典」, mani-mani.net. Accessed on 2009-03-15. ZUN stated that Perfect Cherry Blossom is not a very smart game, saying that since many new people are playing his games, it would be nice to have more fan service, but it is just more of the same. He says that this is on purpose, since doujin games give him the freedom to create what he likes as opposed to game companies where the main goal is to attract new customers.ZUN, Shanghai Alice Correspondence vol. 3, Perfect Cherry Blossom. 2003-08-17. Reception British comedian and satirist Charlie Brooker, in his video game review show Gameswipe, presented Perfect Cherry Blossom as an example of the shoot 'em up genre that \\"masochistic maniacs actively enjoy dipping into\\". He said the game \\"sort of resembles a firework display being sick\\".

Steninge Palace (also known as Steninge Manor) is a Baroque palace overlooking Lake Mälaren near Märsta outside of Stockholm, Sweden. Built 1694-1698 to the design of architect Nicodemus Tessin the Younger, the palace is directly inspired by Château de Vaux-le-Vicomte in France, and has a reputation in Sweden as one of the most elegant examples of Baroque mansions. Steninge Palace was completed in 1705. The estate has a history dating back to the 13th century and has seen many owners, but two families have strongly influenced the premises: those of Carl Gyllenstierna (1649–1735) and Axel von Fersen. Today the palace is privately owned by a company which keeps it accessible for visitors: Steninge Palace Cultural Centre. History In the end of 1200 the first known settlement was established at Steninge. In 1667 Carl Gyllenstierna inherited the Steninge Estate. 1680-81 the well known Swedish architect Nicodemus Tessin was commissioned to design the palace and the two wings. In 1705 Steninge Palace was completed. In 1706 Carl Gyllenstierna married and gave Steninge Palace as a wedding gift to his bride, Anna Soop. In 1735 the Fersen family bought Steninge. In 1747 Steninge was made a trust. In 1810 Axel von Fersen was murdered. A monument of Fersen was erected at Steninge in 1813. Steninge was inherited by his brother Fabian Reinhold von Fersen and then by his nephew Axel von Fersen (1798–1838). When Axel von Fersen died in 1838, the von Fersen family died out and Steninge was inherited by his sister Louise von Fersen and her spouse Carl August Gyldenstolpe, who lost it during their famous bancrupty in 1867. In 1873 Baron von Otter bought Steninge and a stone barn was built west of the palace. In 1970 G.B.A. Holm bought Steninge and employs the architect I.G. Clason to carry out a restoration work. In 1923 Hanna Lindmark bought Steninge Palace. In 1932 Steninge Palace was bought by Wolfgang Thomas, son of the US ambassador in Sweden. In 1969 Steninge Palace was declared a listed building. In 1976 a family with the common name Andersson bought Steninge. In 1979 the large stone barn was declared a listed building. In 1997 Linn and Atle Brynestad (CG Holding) bought Steninge. In 1999 the Steninge Palace Cultural centre opened. In 2009 Steninge Palace and the stone barn were bought by Gelba fastigheter.Steningeslott Gallery Image:Steninge Palace nov 2011 nr1 Publish.jpgSteninge Palace.

It is the third Touhou game to be released specifically for the Windows operating system. It was first released in the 66th Comiket on August 15, 2004.  Gameplay  Imperishable Night plays like a fairly typical vertically scrolling danmaku shooting game, in which the player's character is always facing towards the top of the screen, shooting at anything that moves, avoiding and weaving between enemy bullets, and confronting difficult bosses at the end of a stage. Quite a few details are unique to this game, including Last Spells — for an enemy, a Last Spell is a bonus Spell Card which the player can tackle with the challenge to not to die. On the player side, Last Spells are secondary \\"bomb\\" Spell Cards, which last longer/do much more damage at the expense of two bomb stocks. There is a gauge which tracks how human/youkai (normal/focused) the player is, as well as a new \\"Time\\" system, which affects gameplay. =Time= Every stage has a time counter, which, despite what the name might imply, requires the player to collect a certain amount of \\"time points\\". If the player fails to collect the required amount by the end of the stage, the clock, which tracks the frozen time in Gensokyo, shifts one hour ahead. Otherwise, the clock only advances half an hour. The clock starts at PM 11:00; if the player ever reaches AM 5:00 in-game, the player is given a bad ending. Having to continue also advances the clock by half an hour. Time points are collected via shooting down when playing as a human, or from grazing bullets when playing as yōkai. If the player loses a life, some time points are deducted. Also, when playing on difficulties Normal or higher, filling the time counter for a stage also unlocks the Last Spell for that stage's boss. =Human-yōkai pairs= Imperishable Night features a total of eight playable characters, in pre-set pairs (and later, individually). The pairs, one human and one yōkai, work in tandem: one person fires when unfocused, while the other pops in and fires when focused, with a reduction in movement speed. The two attacks can be drastically different. The individual characters do not have an attack change when focused, although the movement of player familiars (such as Remilia's) may change. A gauge on the lower left corner of the screen keeps track of how human or yōkai the player is, and affects the player's score accordingly. The gauge, ranging from -100% (human) to 100% (yōkai), is determined by which mode the player uses more. When the player reaches ±80%, they can collect time orbs by hitting enemies (as a human) or by grazing against bosses and killing enemies (as a yōkai). Since it is important to collect as many time orbs as possible (to slow time and get high scores), the player should try to keep the gauge either below -80% or above 80%. Because Youmu Konpaku of the Netherworld Dwellers team is half-ghost, their gauges are adjusted accordingly (-50% to 50% solo, -50% to 100% as the team), and the minimum values for time orb collection are reduced. Youmu is the only character that can collect time orbs in both ways because of this. Some enemies use familiars that change their vulnerabilities accordingly depending on whether the player is playing as a human or a yōkai at the moment. These familiars are completely invulnerable when the player switched to a yōkai, but at the same time these familiars cannot collide with the yōkai player and do not shoot bullets when the player is on top of them. The enemies' alternating vulnerabilities in this game draw comparisons with Ikaruga.Sasayama, Yukikuni. 少女弾幕奇譚 東方妖々夢 ～Perfect Cherry Blossom.体験版. 4Gamers.net. 2004. Retrieved 2009-05-01. Bosses may also change their standard attacks depending on the orientation of the player, usually firing slower bullets and/or homing bullets when the player is a yōkai. =Spell Practice Mode= Eirin Yagokoro's \\"Last Word\\" in Spell Practice Mode The Spell Practice Mode is unlocked by beating the game with the normal ending (i.e. before the game time reaches 5:00 am). This feature allows a character/team to practice a spell card (bullet pattern) they have already seen in the Story Mode and Extra Mode. In this mode, players have only one life and cannot bomb, and is only able to clear a spell card by shooting down the boss before time runs out without being hit. Clearing spell cards here will show the creator's own comments on the spell cards or the characters associated with them. Only available in the Spell Practice Mode are Last Words, which are typically the hardest spell cards in the game. These spells are earned by accomplishing certain feats such as beating the game using certain characters/difficulties or seeing/mastering a sufficient number of spell cards.  Plot  It is the eve of the Harvest Moon Festival in Gensokyo when the youkai sense that something is wrong with the moon. It appears that the moon has been replaced by a fake moon that can never become full. In order to find the real moon before sunrise, the protagonists extended the night to make an imperishable night, and set out to find the culprit. After minor skirmishes along the way, including a battle with a fellow culprit-seeker, the protagonists reaches Eientei, the mansion of the perpetrator. Once inside, they find that the mansion is guarded by the moon rabbit Reisen Udongein Inaba, whose ability can cause disorientation. From here, the team may either choose the path that leads to the fake moon conjured by Eirin Yagokoro, or the real moon, where the moon princess Kaguya Houraisan is hiding. It is then realized that the moon was swapped in order to sever the link between the earth and the moon to hide Kaguya from the lunar emissaries who seek to bring her back. The team then accepts Kaguya's \\"Five Impossible Requests\\" and fight until daybreak. Having completed the Five Impossible Requests, the team is given another challenge by Kaguya in the Extra Mode: defeat her rival, Fujiwara no Mokou.  Characters  =Playable characters= Initially, the player must play with one of the four preset teams. After the player has beaten Kaguya with all four teams, then it is possible to play the characters individually. Playing as individuals instead of teams does not change the story. *Illusionary Border Team (幻想の結界チーム) — Ever since the moon got replaced with a fake one, Yukari hasn't been able to sleep.

Unable to die by any means, she and Kaguya attack each other and reincarnate on a daily basis. Development The sole creator of the game, a man who goes by the pseudonym ZUN, had long wanted to make a shooting game where the player can switch between two characters easily during the game, since he perceived that there weren't many games with such a system. The idea for Imperishable Night started with this desire, and the plot was written later to justify this system. He has had the idea before the making of Embodiment of Scarlet Devil, but he felt that having playable characters that were not previously introduced would be unnatural. Thus he decided to make the system in Team Shanghai Alice's third game, Imperishable Night, so he could introduce new characters in the first and second game.ZUN, \\"Shanghai Alice Correspondence Vol.3 (duplicated)\\". Imperishable Night Demo Afterword. 2004-4-18. ZUN found it particularly difficult to find a youkai character to pair Reimu and Marisa with. In the end, ZUN picked Alice from the pre-Windows games to be Marisa's partner since he thought Alice was a \\"Youkai version of Marisa\\", and thus reintroduced her in Perfect Cherry Blossom. Yukari was selected to be Reimu's partner because their personalities were similar and would make sense to be together. Reception Imperishable Night was generally received positively. One reviewer singled out an aspect of Imperishable Night's stage design for analysis: the stage two boss had a gimmick that limits the player's field of view and \\"bring[s] the most tension, excitement, exhilaration, etc., despite it simplifying the game and bringing me to the most primitive of mechanics (the process of movement)\\". The reviewer goes on to say that the presentation and the mechanics of the bullet patterns not only make it possible for this to happen, but also making the gimmick \\"worthwhile and memorable\\". Molinari, Michael. \\"Imperishable Night: Easier challenge means more adrenaline?\\". Gamasutra. 2009-06-03. Related media Touhou Bōgetsushō (東方儚月抄) is an extension of the story in Imperishable Night, split into three parts, each carried by a different Ichijinsha magazine. The main component, Silent Sinner in Blue, is a manga serialized in the monthly Comic Rex; it is through Silent Sinner in Blue that the main plot progresses. Cage in Lunatic Runagate is a novel being serialized in the quarterly Chara Mel; it centers on the viewpoints of the characters around the story. Finally, is a lighthearted yonkoma focusing on Reisen and Tewi Inaba. The plot of Touhou Bōgetsushō overall revolves around the disturbances on the lunar capital, Yukari's plans to invade the moon, and Remilia's rocket trip to the moon. Ichijinsha sought ZUN for this venture before he started to work on Mountain of Faith, and ZUN once had thoughts to make the manga about the upcoming game. However, as development of Mountain of Faith progressed, ZUN decided that he should base the story on something that Touhou fans were already familiar with. He turned to Imperishable Night because he felt the game did not provide much room for character development despite having such a rich cast. With the three-part media blitz, ZUN hoped to expand on the characters' inner thoughts.「東方儚月抄」3誌合同連載へのいきごみ 原作ZUN氏インタビュー, Comic Rex, Ichijinsha, July 2007 issue.

He umpired 25 Test matches between 1963 and 1971 and became Australia's senior umpire after the retirement of Col Egar. As a Detective Sergeant with the Queensland drug squad, Rowan took no nonsense and was inclined to stand on his authority.p. 69, Richard Whitington, Captains Outrageous? Cricket in the seventies, Stanley Paul, 1972 His first match was with Umpire Bill Smyth between Australia and England at Sydney on 11 January to 15 January 1963.  1970/71 season  Rowan umpired six of seven Test matches in the acrimonious 1970–71 Ashes series, but was heavily criticised by Ray Illingworth, Geoff Boycott and John Snow. After the series Boycott and Snow were called to a disciplinary hearing at Lord's over their behaviour, and Illingworth and Snow never toured again.p. 136, John Snow, Cricket Rebel, Hamlyn, 1976 In six full Tests no Australian batsman was given out lbw in the series, which in the minds of the England players was clear evidence of umpiring bias.p101, John Snow, Cricket Rebel, Hamlyn, 1976 It must be remembered that at the time umpires had no recourse to slow motion replays and had to make decisions based on what they saw in a split second, with the benefit of the doubt always going to the batsman. In the First Test Keith Stackpole should have been run out for 18 as Geoff Boycott threw down the wicket at the bowler's end, but Rowan gave the batsman the benefit of the doubt. The Australian papers carried photographs the next day showing that Stackpole was clearly out and labelled the decision \\"one of the worst in cricket history\\".p. 98-99, John Snow, Cricket Rebel, Hamlyn, 1976 Stackpole went on to make 207 – his highest Test score. Rowan's refusal to accept that his decision was wrong gave the England players grave doubts as to his ability and led them to question his judgements for the remainder of the series. In the Second Test Ray Illingworth won the toss, but Rowan refused his request for the roller to be used on the wicket before play began. Rowan later realised his mistake and apologised in the lunch break.p. 74, Criss Freddi, The Guinness Book of Cricket Blunders, Guinness Publishing, 1996 In the Australian first innings Keith Stackpole survived lbw appeals from Ken Shuttleworth and Peter Lever before he was out caught by Lever off Snow for 8. The England fast bowler John Snow wrote, \\"I have never come across another umpire so full of his own importance, so stubborn, lacking in humour, unreasonable and utterly unable to distinguish between a delivery short of a length which rises around the height of the rib cage and a genuine bouncer which goes through head high\\"p. 96, John Snow, Cricket Rebel, Hamlyn, 1976 and believed that chest high balls were not intimidatory. However, the great England umpire Dickie Bird wrote \\"as far as I am concerned, intimidatory bowling is the fast, short pitched ball into the region of the batsman's ribcage. When such a ball is fired in it is then that I feel an umpire must be firm...and tell the bowler to cut it out...that's the killer ball, and that is when I always step in\\".Dickie Bird with Keith Lodge, My Autobiography, Hodder and Stoughton, 1997 As Snow hit tailenders Garth McKenzie and Terry Jenner on the head in the series and continually bowled short at the other Australian batsmen it was not unreasonable for Rowan to intervene. Snow thought this was partisanship as Alan Thomson was not called to book when he bowled bouncers at Snow and six in one eight-ball over against Ray Illingworth.p102, John Snow, Cricket Rebel, Hamlyn, 1976 Snow was twice warned by Rowan for intimidatory bowling in the Second Test at Perth, but refused to accept that rib high balls were intimidatory and continued to bowl them. As a result, Snow was given an official warning, which meant that he would not be allowed to bowl if he was warned again. Illingworth told him that this was to be his last over in any case and the fast bowler sent his last ball flying over the head of Doug Walters, turned to Rowan and said, \\"Now that's a bouncer for you\\".p. 100, John Snow, Cricket Rebel, Hamlyn, 1976 Even John Snow applauded when Rowan and Tom Brooks refused to start play at Melbourne in the abandoned Third Test. Ian Johnson and the Melbourne authorities were desperate to get the game going, but the umpires refused to be pressured as the field was quite unfit for play.p90-91, John Snow, Cricket Rebel, Hamlyn, 1976 A 40-over match was played, won by Australia by 5 wickets. Rowan and Brooks thus became the first umpires to stand in a One Day International match. In the Sixth Test Boycott was run out for 58, but vocally disputed his dismissal and later pointedly refused to apologise for his behaviour, which led to another press furore.p. 78-79, Peter Arnold, The Illustrated Encyclopaedia of World of Cricket, W.H. Smith, 1985 However, on this occasion there was no clear evidence that Rowan's decision was incorrect. The Seventh Test at Sydney on 12 February to 17 February 1971 was Rowan's last, with Tom Brooks as his umpiring colleague. It was a dramatic game won by England by 62 runs to regain The Ashes. Doug Walters had to be stumped twice by Alan Knott off Derek Underwood as he was given not out by Rowan the first time when on 41, but was a few balls later by Brooks for 42.p105, John Snow, Cricket Rebel, Hamlyn, 1976 After Keith Stackpole was caught off a thick edge by Knott off Peter Lever on 13, but was given not out by Rowan, the England captain Ray Illingworth said, \\"It was really unbelievable\\".pp. 107–108, John Snow, Cricket Rebel, Hamlyn, 1976 Later in the innings Illingworth led the English players from the field following a crowd disturbance after John Snow had hit Australian lower-order batsman Terry Jenner on the head with a bouncer. Rowan had issued Snow with a warning for intimidatory bowling and Snow’s and Illingworth’s displeasure was clear to the crowd, who booed passionately. When Snow finished his over and moved to his fielding position on the boundary, he was grabbed by a spectator, and had beer-cans thrown at him. Following the English walk-off, Rowan advised them to either resume or forfeit the match, and the players returned after the ground was cleared. In this Rowan was supported by the England manager David Clark and Alan Barnes of the A.B.C.pp. 104–108, John Snow, Cricket Rebel, Hamlyn, 1976 In 1972 Rowan wrote The Umpire's Story which was highly critical of the England team, particularly of Illingworth and Snow. It even queried, \\"Was John Snow actually grabbed by a spectator who objected to Snow flattening an Australian batsman?\\"p97, John Snow, Cricket Rebel, Hamlyn, 1976 regardless of photographic evidence to the contrary. John Snow in his autobiography Cricket Rebel devoted a whole chapter to \\"Bitter Rows with Umpire Rowan\\".  1971/72 season  In 1971/72 season, a scheduled tour of Australia by South Africa was cancelled following political and moral protests against the apartheid policies of the South African government. In its place a ‘World Team’ visited Australia and played a series of Test standard, although never officially recognised. Rowan stood in three of these matches, including the match at Perth where Dennis Lillee took 8/29 in an innings.

All the artifacts known to date that are accorded the Jiroft label have not been excavated; they have in fact been plundered.\\" also known as the Intercultural style or the Halilrud style, is a postulated early Bronze Age (late 3rd millennium BC) archaeological culture, located in the territory of present-day Balochistan and Kermān Provinces of Iran. The hypothesis is based on a collection of artifacts that have not been formally excavated but rather recovered from looters by Iranian authorities; accepted by many to have derived from the Jiroft area in south central Iran, as reported by online Iranian news services, beginning in 2001. The proposed type site is Konar Sandal, near Jiroft in the Halil River area. Other significant sites associated with the culture include; Shahr-e Sukhteh (Burnt City), Tepe Bampur, Espiedej, Shahdad, Tal-i-Iblis and Tepe Yahya. The proposition of grouping these sites as an \\"independent Bronze Age civilization with its own architecture and language\\", intermediate between Elam to the west and the Indus Valley Civilization to the east, is due to Yusef Majidzadeh, head of the archaeological excavation team in Jiroft. He speculates they may be the remains of the lost Aratta Kingdom, but his conclusions have met with skepticism from some reviewers. Other conjectures (e.g. Daniel T. Potts, Piotr Steinkeller) have connected Konar Sandal with the obscure city-state of Marhashi, that apparently lay to the east of Elam proper. Discovery and excavation Many artifacts associated with Jiroft were recovered from looters described as \\"destitute villagers\\" who had scavenged the area south of Jiroft before 2001, when a team led by Yusef Majidzadeh began excavations. The team uncovered more than two square kilometers of remains from a city dating back to at least the late 3rd millennium BC. The data Madjidzadeh's team has gathered demonstrates that Jiroft's heyday was from 2500 BC to 2200 BC. The looted artifacts and some vessels recovered by the excavators were of the so- called \\"intercultural style\\" type of pottery known from Mesopotamia and the Iranian Plateau, and since the 1960s from nearby Tepe Yahya in Baft. The \\"Jiroft civilization\\" hypothesis proposes that this \\"intercultural style\\" is in fact the distinctive style of a previously unknown, long-lived civilization. This is not universally accepted. Archaeologist Oscar Muscarella of the Metropolitan Museum of Art criticizes that the excavators resorted to sensationalist announcements while being more slow in publishing scholarly reports, and their claims that the site's stratigraphy shows continuity into the 4th millennium as overly optimistic. Muscarella does nevertheless acknowledge the importance of the site. Earlier excavations at Kerman were conducted by Sir Aurel Stein around 1930. Jiroft culture artifact. One of the most notable archaeological excavations done in Kerman Province was one done by a group led by Professor Joseph Caldwell from Illinois State Museum in 1966 (Tal-i-Iblis) and Lamberg-Karlovsky from Harvard University in 1967 (Tepe Yahya Sogan Valley, Dolatabad). Archeological excavations in Jiroft led to the discovery of several objects belonging to the fourth millennium BC. According to Majidzadeh, geophysical operations by French experts in the region indicate the existence at least 10 historical and archaeological periods in the region belonging to different civilizations who lived in this area during different periods of time in history. According to the French experts who studied this area, the evidence remained from these civilizations may be traced up to 11 meters under the ground. \\"What is obvious is that the evidence of Tal-i-Iblis culture in Bardsir can be traced in all parts of the region. Tal-i-Iblis culture, known as Ali Abad period (fourth millennium BC) was revealed by Joseph R. Caldwell, American archaeologist,\\" said Majidzadeh.

At Konar Sandal B, a two-story, windowed citadel with a base of close to 13.5 hectares was found. Helmand culture Master of animals in chlorite, Jiroft, Kerman ca. 2500 BC, Bronze Age I, National Museum of Iran Helmand culture of western Afghanistan was a Bronze Age culture of the 3rd millennium BC. Some scholars link it with Shahr-i Sokhta, Mundigak, and Bampur. The term \\"Helmand civilization\\" was proposed by M. Tosi. This civilization flourished between 2500 and 1900 BC, and may have coincided with the great flourishing of the Indus Valley Civilization. This was also the final phase of Periods III and IV of Shahr-i Sokhta, and the last part of Mundigak Period IV.Jarrige, J.-F., Didier, A. & Quivron, G. (2011) Shahr-i Sokhta and the Chronology of the Indo-Iranian Borderlands. Paléorient 37 (2) : 7-34 academia.edu Thus, Jiroft culture is closely related to Helmand culture. Jiroft culture flourished in the eastern Iran, and the Helmand culture in western Afghanistan at the same time. In fact, they may represent the same cultural area. Mehrgarh culture, on the other hand, is far earlier. Writing system Jiroft culture inscriptions. An inscription, discovered in a palace, was carved on a brick whose lower left corner only has remained, explained Yusef Majidzadeh, head of the Jiroft excavation team.http://edition.presstv.ir/detail/29784.html \\"The two remaining lines are enough to recognize the Elamite script,\\" he added. \\"The only ancient inscriptions known to experts before the Jiroft discovery were cuneiform and hieroglyph,\\" said Majidzadeh, adding that \\"The new-found inscription is formed by geometric shapes and no linguist around the world has been able to decipher it yet.\\" Some Iranian archeologists believe the discovered inscription is the most ancient script found so far, predating these others, and that the Elamite written language originated in Jiroft, where the writing system developed first and was then spread across the country. Other scholars have called the authenticity of the cyphers into question, suggesting they may be examples of several modern forgeries in circulation since the earlier lootingCounterfeit artefacts in circulation since discovery Encyclopædia Iranica at the site.

The game was released in 1985 for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC home computers. Players control a witch, who aims to become the \\"Witch Queen\\" by defeating an enemy called the \\"Pumpking\\". Designed by Steve Brown and Richard Leinfellner, Cauldron originated as a licensed video game of the horror film Halloween. Brown eventually altered the game to use a theme based on the Halloween holiday. The mix of two genres resulted from Brown and Leinfellner wanting to make a shoot 'em up and platform game, respectively. The developers realized that there were no technical limitations preventing the genres from being combined. The game received praise from video game magazines, who focused on the graphics and two different modes of play. A common complaint was Cauldrons excessive difficulty. The following year, Palace released a direct sequel titled Cauldron II: The Pumpkin Strikes Back.  Gameplay  The witch (top left) flies along the landscape and shoots enemies. Game statistics (points obtained, magic points, and remaining lives) are tracked at the top. The ZX Spectrum version is pictured. Players navigate the witch protagonist through the 2D game world from a side-view perspective. Cauldron is divided into two modes of play: shooting while flying and jumping along platforms. Areas of the game world set on the surface feature the witch flying on a broomstick, while underground segments require the witch to run and jump in caverns. In the flying segments, players must search for randomly scattered coloured keys to access underground areas that contain six ingredients. The objective is to collect the ingredients and return them to the witch's cottage to complete a spell that can defeat the Pumpking. While traversing the game world, the witch encounters Halloween-themed enemies such as pumpkins, ghosts, skulls, and bats, as well as other creatures like sharks and seagulls. A collision with an enemy causes the witch's magic meter (which is also used to fire offensive projectiles at enemies) to decrease. The character dies once the meter is depleted. After dying, the character reappears on the screen and the meter is refilled. Players are given limited opportunities for this to occur, and the game ends once the number of lives reaches zero.  Development  Cauldron began development as a game based on the 1978 film Halloween. Palace obtained the video game rights and assigned Steve Brown to the project. Unable to develop a concept he was happy with, Brown took the game in a new direction. Inspired by the Halloween holiday, he envisioned a game featuring witches and pumpkins. Stuart Hunt of Retro Gamer, however, attributed the switch to Mary Whitehouse's campaign against violent horror films in the 1980s. Brown submitted concept drawings to Palace co- founder Pete Stone, who approved further development. Influenced by what he deemed a \\"classical witch\\", Brown designed the witch with a long nose and a broomstick. He created a Plasticine model of the character as a reference for a painting that was used for the game's box art. Brown was joined by Richard Leinfellner, who served as the lead programmer. The two enjoyed different video game genres—Brown liked platform games, while Leinfellner preferred shoot 'em ups—and decided to create a game engine that could handle both methods of playing. Both developers play tested the game, but only played the segments individually rather than in a sequence. In retrospect, Brown attributes the game's excess difficulty to this along with the fact that the two played with unlimited game lives. The game was released on three home computers: Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, and ZX Spectrum. The Spectrum and Amstrad versions lack scrolling graphics in the shoot 'em up levels and use flick-screening to approximate it. A port of Palace's 1984 game The Evil Dead, originally programmed for the Commodore 64 by Leinfellner, was included on the second side of the Spectrum cassette. Retailers feared a parental backlash, resulting in a limited release for the game. Palace chose to include The Evil Dead to distribute the game to a wider audience.  Reception and legacy  The game was well-received by the video game press, who focused on the graphical quality and game design. Tony Takoushi of Computer and Video Games described the game as a \\"quality arcade-adventure\\" and called the graphics stunning. Reviewers from Crash magazine praised the animation and detail of the graphics, as well as the gameplay. Three of Zzap!64s reviewers—Julian Rignall, Bob Wade, and Gary Penn—echoed similar statements about the graphics. The group complimented the gameplay, specifically the adventure aspects, and considered the large game world a positive component. A Computer Gamer reviewer praised the flying portions of the game, calling the gameplay enjoyable. While he praised the platforming portions, the reviewer commented that design flaws made the game more difficult than it should have been. Clare Edgeley of Sinclair User praised the graphical quality of the ZX Spectrum version, but commented that the colors occasionally overlap and the screen flickers. ZX Computings reviewer praised the ZX Spectrum conversion, calling it superior to the Commodore 64 release. The reviewer lauded the graphics and gameplay of the flying segments, but bemoaned the platforming aspect and described it as a Jet Set Willy clone. Publications dedicated to the ZX Spectrum platform considered the inclusion of The Evil Dead with the ZX Spectrum release a positive aspect that added value to the overall package. The game's difficulty was a common complaint. Computer Gamer, Crash, and ZX Computing commented that playing the game with limited lives was very challenging. Retro Gamers Craig Grannell described the game as \\"unforgiving\\", citing difficulty landing and excessive precision required in the flying and platforming segments respectively. Following the success of Cauldron, Palace released a direct sequel, Cauldron II: The Pumpkin Strikes Back, in 1986. The game is set after the events of the first game, and features a bouncing pumpkin that survived the witch's ascension to power. Players navigate the pumpkin around a castle in search of the Witch Queen to enact revenge. Cauldron was later re-released along with its sequel as a compilation title on Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum computers. The commercial success of the two Cauldron games prompted Palace to give Brown more creative freedom for his following project, Barbarian: The Ultimate Warrior.

Little is known of him before his entrance into the Carthusian monastery at Cologne on 14 March 1435, at the age of 32 years. On account of his edifying example in the observance of the rule and his extensive scriptural and theological learning he was highly esteemed by his confrères, and as early as 1438, only three years after his entrance into the order, he became prior of the monastery of Mont-Saint-André at Tournai (Doornik) in Belgium. The desire for a reform of the religious orders, which animated many great men of the 15th century, had also penetrated the soul of Birnbaum. Being a true reformer, he soon succeeded, by the irresistible force of his own pious example, in abolishing the few abuses that had found admittance into the various monasteries over which he became prior, and in restoring the austere monastic discipline established by the founder St. Bruno. After holding the position of prior at Mont-Saint-André for 7 years, he was active in the same office successively at Wesel in the Duchy of Cleves, until 1457; at Rettel in Lorraine, until 1459; at Trier, until 1461; and at Diest in Belgium, until 1463. In 1463 he was appointed prior at Liège, but ill health forced him to resign this position and retire to the Carthusian monastery at Cologne, where he had spent the first days of this monastic life. The remaining ten years of his life Birnbaum spent in writing several ascetic works and in preparing for a happy death. There were with him at that time in the Carthusian monastery of Cologne some of the most learned and saintly men of Germany such as Hermann Appeldorn (died 1472), Hermann Grefken (died 1480), Heinrich von Dissen (died 1484), and Werner Rolevinck (died 1502). Birnbaum wrote for the instruction and direction of the members of his order a number of works, many of which, however, have not yet been put in print, also: * \\"Defensio pro Immaculato Conceptu B.M.V.\\" * \\"Excepta ex malo granato cum nonnullis conjunctis\\" He has often been confused with his uncle of the same name, one of the most learned jurists of the 15th century, who was for some time provost of St. Kunibert's at Cologne, and who died in 1439.

He played as a catcher in Major League Baseball for the Cincinnati Reds (1961–67), St. Louis Cardinals (1968) and Houston Astros (1969–74).At Times It's Smart To Be Dumb, Says Cincy's Edwards, by Ritter Collett, Baseball Digest, June 1965, Vol. 24, No. 5, Known for his excellent defensive skills, Edwards was a three-time All-Star and a two-time National League Gold Glove Award winner. Playing career Edwards graduated from West High School (Columbus, Ohio) and then Ohio State University where he led the team in hits (24) in 1958 and became a member of Phi Kappa Tau fraternity. He was signed as an amateur free agent by the Cincinnati Reds in 1959. He made his Major League debut at age 23 on June 27, 1961 in a 10–8 Reds' win over the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field. In his first at-bat he pinch-hit in the seventh inning for Reds' starting catcher Jerry Zimmerman, drawing a walk against reliever Barney Schultz and later scoring on a triple by Jerry Lynch. In his next at-bat, in the ninth inning, he got his first hit and first RBI, driving in Gordy Coleman with a single against reliever Joe Schaffernoth. During Edwards' rookie season, he backed up Zimmerman and helped the Reds win the 1961 National League pennant. In the 1961 World Series Edwards had 4 hits and 2 RBIs in a losing cause, as the New York Yankees defeated the Reds in 5 games. He put up solid offensive numbers from 1962 to 1965, earning three MLB All Star appearances. His offensive numbers diminished after he suffered a broken finger on the last day of spring training in 1966, but he continued to be one of the best defensive catchers in the National League. On June 14, 1965, Edwards was the Reds catcher when pitcher Jim Maloney went 10 innings against the New York Mets without allowing a hit. Edwards left the game in the 10th inning for a pinch runner with the game in a scoreless tie, as the Mets went on to break up the no-hitter and score a run to win the game in the 11th inning. A little more than two months later, on August 19, 1965, Edwards was once again the catcher as Maloney threw another 10 innings without allowing a hit. This time the Reds scored a run, securing the victory and the no-hitter for Maloney. With the arrival of Johnny Bench, the Reds traded Edwards to the St. Louis Cardinals for Pat Corrales and Jimy Williams on February 8, 1968. With the Cardinals, he played backup catcher to Tim McCarver, helping them win the National League pennant, however, they would subsequently lose to the Detroit Tigers in the 1968 World Series. He caught Ray Washburn's no-hitter on September 18 of that 1968 season. On October 11, 1968 Edwards was traded with minor league player Tommy Smith to the Houston Astros for Dave Giusti and Dave Adlesh. After playing his first season for the Houston Astros in 1969, he finished 36th in voting for the National League Most Valuable Player Award. His final game played, at age 36, was a 5–4 10-inning Astros' loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers at the Astrodome on October 2, 1974. In his final plate appearance, pinch-hitting in the 10th inning for Skip Jutze against the Dodgers' Eddie Solomon, Edwards drew a walk. Career statistics In a fourteen-year major league career, Edwards played in 1,470 games, producing 1,106 hits in 4,577 at bats for a .242 batting average along with 81 home runs, 524 runs batted in and a .311 on-base percentage. A solid defensive player, he had a career fielding percentage of .992 which was 4 points above the league average, helping him earn the National League Gold Glove Award for catchers in 1963 and 1964 Edwards was voted to three National League All-Star teams in 1963, 1964 and 1965. He led National League catchers in fielding percentage four times in 1963, 1969, 1970 and 1971.Baseball Digest, July 2001, Vol. 60, No. 7, He also led the league four times in assists and three times in putouts. In 1969, Edwards set single season records for catchers with 1,135 putouts and 1,221 total chances. Richard Kendall of the Society for American Baseball Research devised an unscientific study that ranked Edwards as the second most dominating fielding catcher in major league history. He caught 109 shutouts during his career, ranking him 22nd all-time among major league catchers. As of the end of the 2016 Major League Baseball season he ranked 86th on the All-Time Intentional Walks List. Personal life Edwards earned a degree in Engineering from Ohio State. During the off-seasons while with the Reds, he worked as an engineer for General Electric in research and development for nuclear fuel elements. Baseball Digest, May 1964, Vol. 23, No. 4, He was inducted into the Ohio State Varsity O Hall of Fame in September 2008.

When the later Aurelian Walls were built, the road left the city through the Porta Ostiensis (Porta San Paolo).

Morrison (1861–1936) was a Canadian farm leader in Ontario, Canada, a founder of the United Farmers of Ontario (UFO) in 1914, and a leader of the co-operative movement. He was the UFO's sometimes controversial general secretary, who was given to making bizarre pronouncements, during the period in which it became a political party and took power in the province following the 1919 provincial election. Early career Morrison was born on his family's homestead in Peel Township, Wellington County. He worked in manufacturing in Toronto for twelve years but returned to his family's farm in 1900. Morrison became active in the agrarian movement. United Farmers' leadership and infighting Morrison helped found the UFO in 1914 as a farm advocacy organization of which he remained its secretary until 1933, and over which he exercised a sometimes somewhat eccentric leadership style. Among Morrison's early colleagues in the UFO were future Ontario Premiers Mitchell Hepburn and Harry Nixon. Morrison also served as secretary of the United Farmers Co-operative Company Ltd. (UFCC) from 1914 to 1935. The UFCC was the purchasing co-operative that the UFO operated on behalf of its members. =Uniquely erratic political — or apolitical — style= The UFO entered party politics in the 1919 provincial election, although it was far from clear whether Morrison regarded himself as exercising a rôle according to conventional notions of party politics. To everyone's surprise, the UFO won enough seats to form a government in coalition with Labour MLAs. Morrison had hoped the UFO would be able to hold the balance of power and thus win legislation favourable to farmers but there began a whole series of sometimes erratic actions and position taking on the part of Morrison which are difficult to describe adequately according to conventional notions of success or failure. =Unwillingness to serve as Premier= Despite his party's winning of enough seats in the Ontario Legislature, Morrison retained reservations about the UFO even forming a government. The party ran without a leader and had no designated individual to serve as Premier of Ontario. Morrison himself was offered the position of Premier, but he declined; in the light of Morrison's later behavior with regard to the Premier who did take office instead, this apparent unwillingness to lead in government office was ironic. Instead of Morrison, E.C. Drury was appointed Premier. =Unsupportive of Drury's Premiership= Morrison continued as UFO general secretary, yet, having declined to be Premier himself, steadfastly proved through a series of actions and stances to be unwilling to exercise a supportive role during Drury's Premiership. Morrison became a thorn in the side of the Drury government on various levels. He held no formal government responsibility, but he had much power. =Opposition to alliance with urban workers= Morrison opposed the UFO's alliance with urban workers and the labour movement. Instead, Morrison was an advocate of what was known as a non-partisan \\"group government\\", National Farmers' Union in Ontario, 'The History of the N.F.U.' as advocated by Henry Wise Wood, of the United Farmers of Alberta. However, Premier Drury was not in agreement with this position. As head of the Provincial government, Drury rejected Morrison's position as impractical. =Objection to i) pension and ii) marketing initiatives= Morrison objected to initiatives by the Drury government such as a superannuation scheme for civil servants which was denounced by farmers. He also opposed attempts by the government to establish a marketing system. =Opposition of Morrison's United Farmers to road improvement= The United Farmers of Ontario, as led by Morrison, could sometimes take stances widely regarded as bizarre and irrational. For example, even when the grouping was the leading element in Ontario's government, Morrison's UFO articulated hostility to the idea of good roads. Such an arguably unpalatable stance only served to discredit Morrison's UFO further in the eyes of the electorate. =Collapse of Drury government= The lack of support by Morrison and his faction of the UFO was a contributing factor to the Drury government's electoral defeat in the 1923 election after one term; it could be fairly stated that, at least partly because of Morrison's series of stances, the UFO-led government spearheaded its own defeat. Drury's long, enforced retirement Subsequently, Morrison's UFO was not to lead an Ontario government again. After 1923, former Premier Drury, for his part, was left with the legacy of the memory of what may be widely regarded as many, highly unusual happenings during his Premiership. (Drury's period of retirement was long — he lived until 1968.) Later career Premier Drury was replaced by Howard Ferguson in 1923, a circumstance which led Morrison into further controversy. While undoubtedly in some form of Opposition, he continued to exercise his unconventional style seen in the time when he was active in some form of Government-linked rôle. =Hostility to a personal, Official Opposition role= Morrison was personally unwilling to lead the United Farmers as the Official Opposition in the Ontario Legislature. However, this did not indicate that Morrison acquiesced at others in his own organization taking a more prominent role in the organization. This led to further difficulties. =Hostility to a UFO, Official Opposition role= Against Morrison's own colleagues' views — he was also unwilling for the United Farmers to be designated the Official Opposition. Instead, the designation of Official Opposition went to the Ontario Liberal Party. This bizarre situation arose, despite Morrison's own United Farmers having more seats than the Liberals. Personal legacy =Family background= Morrison's daughter, Rae Luckock, became a politician and served as an Ontario Co-operative Commonwealth Federation Member of Provincial Parliament in the 1940s. =Political repercussions= Morrison was a mentor to Agnes Macphail who served as an MP in the House of Commons of Canada in the 1920s and 1930s. Macphail and Luckock were the first two women elected to the Ontario legislature in 1943. When his UFO was in office, Morrison undoubtedly spent many of his energies in conflict with UFO Premier Drury. Morrison's fraught relations with Premier Drury in the crucial period 1919-1923 may be summed up as follows: It was difficult for Drury to countenance successful governance in collaboration with his nominal ally, Morrison, because the latter was more interested in farming — and his personal relations with fellow farmers — than in matters of governance. It was equally difficult for Drury to try to govern without Morrison, since the latter as UFO leader had the power to bring him down (which, in substance, did indeed happen). The career of J J Morisson arguably exemplifies the results of a single issue cause mindset being thrust upon the political scene, while remaining disturbingly immune to perceptions of political feasibility. Morrison died in 1936.

Vincent Rose (né Vincenzo Cacioppo; 13 June 1880 Palermo, Italy – 20 May 1944 Rockville Centre, New York) was an Italian-born American violinist, pianist, composer, and bandleader.  Career  Rose holds one of the longest histories as a band leader. He achieved much popularity with his Montmartre Orchestra in the 1920s, and recorded with the group for RCA. The same personnel later recorded for the Columbia label as the Hollywood Orchestra. After leaving California, he settled in New York, but continued to record as \\"Vincent Rose and His Orchestra\\" for various labels throughout the 1930s. Rose was a prolific songwriter, having published well over 200 songs. His hits included: :* 1920 \\"Whispering\\" :* 1921 \\"Avalon\\", with lyrics by Al Jolson and B.G. DeSylva, a big hit for Jolson. :* 1923 \\"Linger Awhile\\" :* 1940 \\"Blueberry Hill\\" In 1921, the estate of Giovanni Ricordi and the music publishing firm he founded, Casa Ricordi — the publisher of Puccini's operas — sued all parties associated with the song, \\"Avalon,\\" claiming the melody was \\"lifted\\" from the aria \\"E lucevan le stelle\\" from Puccini's opera Tosca. The court found for Puccini and his publisher, and they were awarded $25,000 in damages, plus all future print royalties earned by \\"Avalon\\". The composer and his heirs, however, continued to receive performance royalties under an agreement reached with Ricordi for payment of only $1. Such royalties amounted to a very significant amount of money during the remainder of the 20th century, certainly far more than the $25,000 paid in damages to the publisher. Songwriters on Parade In the late 1930s and early 1940s Rose and several of his fellow hitmakers formed a sensational review called Songwriters on Parade, performing all across the eastern seaboard on the Loew's and Keith circuits.

He played rugby league for the Sydney Roosters and the Wigan Warriors in the Super League. He also played for the PNG Kumuls, Queensland State of Origin team and the Rest of the World team. He was the head coach of Papua New Guinea Kumuls between 2007 and 2012. Background Lam was born 25 August 1970 in Rabaul, Papua New Guinea. His mother was from Liverpool and migrated to Australia as a child. She met Lam's father, a Chinese-Papua New Guinean, in Rabaul. The family moved to Brisbane in the Australian state of Queensland when Lam was seven. Playing career Lam had a fertile career with 14 State of Origin football matches for Queensland, including a man-of-the-match performance in the third game of the 1995 series. He made his Test début for Papua New Guinea in 1994 and went on to win 11 caps, scoring 3 tries and kicking 1 field goal. In 1996, he captained the 'Papua New Guinea National Rugby League Team' against Australia. In 1997, he captained the 'Rest of the World' team against Australia. He captained the Kumuls to the quarter finals in the 2000 Rugby League World Cup. He played at halfback for the Sydney Roosters in their 2000 NRL Grand Final defeat by the Brisbane Broncos. He played a total of 146 club games for the Sydney Roosters, scoring 42 tries and kicking 6 field goals, as well as 119 first team games for Wigan Warriors, scoring 44 tries, kicking 1 goal and 10 field goals, including a try in their 2001 Super League Grand Final defeat by the Bradford Bulls. Lam is one of only a few players to have played State of Origin for Queensland and for a country other than Australia. He is also the only player to be captain of a Queensland side and captain of a national team other than Australia. The reason he was allowed to do this was that due to the Super League war, Queensland were in need of a half-back due to the fact regular half-back Allan Langer had signed with Super League. Coaching career Lam in 2012 Lam became coach of Papua New Guinea Kumuls national rugby league team in 2007, and was in charge for their 2008 Rugby League World Cup campaign. He quit as Kumuls' coach in 2009 after a dispute with the Papua New Guinea Rugby Football League. In June 2007 he was appointed inaugural coach of the new QRL Wizard Queensland Cup Northern Pride team based in Cairns. However, three months later he was offered the position of assistant coach at the NRL Sydney Roosters under their new coach Brad Fittler. Lam was released and he left Cairns for Sydney before the Pride's first game. In 2009 he moved to the St. George Illawarra Dragons as assistant coach under Wayne Bennett.http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/nrl/lam-organising-sowards- game/story-e6frfgbo-1225809525390 Lam became the coach of the St George- Illawarra Dragons Under 20s team in 2010 and 2011. He returned as coach of Papua New Guinea in 2012. Lam returned to Wigan Warriors in 2019 as interim Head Coach and later in 2019 made his spell as Wigan coach full time as he signed for another year after Shaun Edwards opted not to join Wigan for 2020. Personal life In 2010 a court ordered former State of Origin teammate Dale Shearer to repay approximately $1.5m to Lam for an outstanding loan which dated back to 2005. His son, Lachlan Lam, is also a Papua New Guinea international.

Évolué (, \\"evolved\\" or \\"developed\\") is a French label used during the colonial era to refer to a native African or Asian who had \\"evolved\\" by becoming Europeanised through education or assimilation and had accepted European values and patterns of behavior. It is most commonly used to refer to individuals within the Belgian and French colonial empires. Évolués spoke French, followed European (rather than customary) laws, usually held white-collar jobs (although rarely higher than clerks), and lived primarily in urban areas of the colony. Belgian colonies The term was also used to describe the growing native middle class in the Belgian Congo (the modern-day Democratic Republic of the Congo) between the latter part of World War II and the independence of the colony in 1960. Most évolués emerged from the Congolese who filled skilled positions (such as clerks and nurses) made available by the economic boom in the country following the war. Colonial administrators defined an évolué as \\"a man having broken social ties with his group, [and] having entered another system of motivations, another system of values.\\" While there were no universal criteria for determining évolué status, it was generally accepted that one would have \\"a good knowledge of French, adhere to Christianity, and have some form of post-primary education.\\" Early on in their history, most évolués sought to use their unique status to earn special privileges in the Congo. They asked that the colonial administration recognize their role as mediators between the Belgians and the native \\"savages.\\" On 12 July 1948 the Governor-General of the Belgian Congo issued an ordinance creating the carte de mérite civique (civic merit card), which could be granted to any Congolese who had no criminal record, did not practice polygamy, abandoned traditional religion, and had some degree of education. Literacy was required except for those persons who had served 20 years as a customary chief or who had provided \\"good and faithful service\\" for 25 years in the administration. Cardholders were given an improved legal status and were exempt from certain restrictions on travel into European districts. Of the thousands of évolués in the Congo, only a small proportion of them earned a carte; in 1957 there were 1,557 cardholders. There was discontent about the limited nature of the privileges attached to the carte de mérite civique, so in 1952 the colonial administration introduced the carte d'immatriculation, which granted to those who obtained it full legal equality with Europeans. The latter card was much more difficult to obtain; one who sought to obtain it had to have a letter of recommendation from his employer and pass an evaluation. The evaluation was administered by an investigative commission, which would visit a candidate in his home, examine his household items such as linen and silverware, and ascertain if he ate with his wife at the table and communicated with his children in French. After this, a candidate and his wife had to appear before the head magistrate of the provincial court to answer a series of questions. By 1958 only 217 Congolese had been awarded a carte d'immatriculation. Most évolués found immatriculation irritating and by the mid-1950s the project was thoroughly discredited. A social club in the Belgian Congo, c. 1943. Since opportunities for upward mobility through the colonial structure were limited, the évolué class institutionally manifested itself through clubs and associations. Through these groups they could enjoy trivial privileges that made them feel distinct from the Congolese \\"masses\\". In 1947, there were 110 social clubs consisting of 5,609 members throughout the Congo's cities. From 1952 to 1956, the number of clubs rose from 131 to 317, with their membership increasing from 7,661 to 15,345. Most of these associations were rather small, but some eventually grew in size to encompass entire regions and ethnic groups, such as the Alliance des Bakongo. Évolués organised most of the educational opportunities for women in the Belgian Congo, since the colonial government put little effort into such a venture. By 1958, colonial officials estimated that there were 175,000 people who could be classed as évolués in the colony. In the final years leading up to independence, évolués played a major role in colonial propaganda as they were felt to exemplify the success of the Belgian civilizing mission begun under King Leopold II. In particular, it was felt that after independence, the assimilation of European values by the évolués meant that Belgian civilian inhabitants of the Congo could continue to live in the Congo as part of a culturally European multiracial state. Over time many évolués grew disillusioned with their attempts to assimilate with European culture, as it did not lead to full equality and the elimination of discrimination they sought. As this occurred, many became politically active and began pushing for Congolese independence from Belgium. In 1954, the colonial government opened Lovanium University in Léopoldville in order to provide university education to Congolese évolués. Many of the leaders of the African nationalist parties in the Belgian Congo were members of the évolué class. In the 1970s, President of Zaire Mobutu Sese Seko launched a policy known as Authenticité in which he called for Zairian people to renounce all the cultural legacies of the colonial period by dressing and speaking in an \\"authentic\\" Zairian manner. French colonies In the French colonial empire, évolués were seen as individuals who were the desired end product of France's assimilation policy. Évolués were treated as an élite and a privileged group by the colonial administrators.

Arabized Berber () denotes an inhabitant of the Maghreb region in northwestern Africa, whose native language is a local dialect of Arabic and whose ethnic origins are Berber. Many populations in North Africa are of Berber heritage, including those inhabiting Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya. The widespread language shift from Berber to Arabic happened, at least partially, due to the privileged status that the Arabic language has generally been given in the states of North Africa, from the Arab conquest in 652 up until the French colonialism in the twentieth century, as well as the migration of the Banu Hilal and Banu Sulaym tribes to North Africa. Historical perspective Medieval Arabic sources frequently refer to North Africa (excluding Egypt) as Bilad Al Barbar or 'Land of the Berbers' (Arabic: بلادالبربر) prior to the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb. This designation may have given rise to the term Barbary Coast which was used by Europeans until the 19th century to refer to coastal Northwest Africa. But the cultural impact of Islam was big as it was the only boost for the spread of the Arabic language. Since the populations were partially affiliated with the Arab Muslim culture, North Africa was starting to be referred to by the Arabic speakers as Al-Maġrib (meaning \\"The West\\") since it was considered as the western part of the known world. For historical references, medieval Arab and Muslim historians and geographers used to refer to Morocco as Al-Maghrib al Aqşá (\\"The Farthest West\\"), disambiguating it from neighboring historical regions called Al-Maghrib al Awsat (\\"The Middle West\\", Algeria), and Al- Maghrib al Adna (\\"The Nearest West\\", Tunisia and Libya). Even though many of these cities have often been linguistically Arabized (like Fes or Marrakesh), from a historic point of view it is accepted that the core population of North Africa is Berber. More than rural areas, the cities were a melting pot of different ethnicities, so the city dwellers are more likely to have non-pure Berber ancestry. By tracing the history of certain Maghrebian areas, historians are able to make assertions about its inhabitants. For instance, even though Casablanca (Berber name: Anfa) and Rabat were both built and originally settled by Berbers, it is known that the area's original inhabitants were ousted by the Almohads and subsequently resettled with nomadic Banu Hilal Arabs. Other, traditionally Berber, cities like Tangiers, Meknes and Marrakesh have never had such a drastic repopulation, so it could be assumed that its inhabitants today are of Berber stock. Although these cities have for centuries now been linguistically Arabized, their culture and identity often have not been through that process. The cities of Tangiers, Tetouan, Meknes and Marrakesh still have a strong regional Berber aspect to them and their inhabitants do not necessarily consider themselves to be ethnically Arab, even though their language might be today's Moroccan-Arabic. Berberists and linguistic Arabization According to Berber activists, Algerians and Moroccans are overwhelmingly Berber, whose identity needs to be reawakened. North Africa was gradually Arabized with the spread of Islam in the 7th century AD, when the liturgical language Arabic was first brought to the Maghreb. However, the identity of northwestern Africa remained Berber for a long time thereafter. Additionally, even though the process of Arabization began with these early invasions, many large parts of North Africa were only recently Arabized like the Aurès (Awras) mountains in the 19th and 20th centuries. Although, the fertile plains of North Africa seem to have been (at least partly) Arabized in the 11th century with the emigration of the Banu Hilal tribes from Arabia. Population genetics Various population genetic studies along with historians such as Gabriel Camps and Charles-André Julien lend support to the idea that the bulk of the gene pool of modern maghrebis, irrespective of linguistic group, is derived from the Berber populations of the pre-Islamic period.Arredi et al.

Peer support is also used to refer to initiatives where colleagues, members of self-help organizations and others meet, in person or online, as equals to give each other connection and support on a reciprocal basis. Peer support is distinct from other forms of social support in that the source of support is a peer, a person who is similar in fundamental ways to the recipient of the support; their relationship is one of equality. A peer is in a position to offer support by virtue of relevant experience: he or she has \\"been there, done that\\" and can relate to others who are now in a similar situation. Trained peer support workers such as peer support specialists and peer counselors receive special training and are required to obtain Continuing Education Units, like clinical staff. Some other trained peer support workers may also be law-enforcement personnel and firefighters as well as emergency medical responders. Underlying theory The effectiveness of peer support is believed to derive from a variety of psychosocial processes described best by Dr. Karen Fortuna in 2019:. social support, experiential knowledge, social learning theory, social comparison theory, the helper-therapy principle, and self-determination theory. *Social support is the existence of positive psychosocial interactions with others with whom there is mutual trust and concern. Positive relationships contribute to positive adjustment and buffer against stressors and adversities by offering (a) emotional support (esteem, attachment, and reassurance), (b) instrumental support (material goods and services), (c) companionship and (d) information support (advice, guidance, and feedback). *Experiential knowledge is specialized information and perspectives that people obtain from living through a particular experience such as substance abuse, a physical disability, chronic physical or mental illness, or a traumatic event such as combat, a natural disaster, domestic violence or a violent crime, sexual abuse, or imprisonment. Experiential knowledge tends to be unique and pragmatic and when shared contributes to solving problems and improving quality of life.Shubert, M., & Borkman, T. (1994). \\"Identifying the experiential knowledge developed within a self-help group.\\" In T. Powell (Ed.) Understanding the self-help organization. Thousand Oaks: Sage Publications. *Social learning theory postulates that peers, because they have undergone and survived relevant experiences, are more credible role models for others. Interactions with peers who are successfully coping with their experiences or illness are more likely to result in positive behavior change. *Social comparison means that individuals are more comfortable interacting with others who share common characteristics with themselves, such as a psychiatric illness, in order to establish a sense of normalcy. By interacting with others who are perceived to be better than them, peers are given a sense of optimism and something to strive toward. *The helper-therapy principle proposes that there are four significant benefits to those who provide peer support:Riessman, F. (1965). \\"The 'Helper-therapy' principle.\\" Social Work, 10, 27-32, (a) increased sense of interpersonal competence as a result of making an impact on another person's life; (b) development of a sense of equality in giving and taking between himself or herself and others; (c) helper gains new personally-relevant knowledge while helping; and (d) the helper receives social approval from the person they help, and others.From Salzer and Shear, S. L. (2002), p. 282. *Self- determination means that individuals have the right to determine their own future—people are more likely to act on their own decisions rather than decisions made by others for them. In schools and education =Peer mentoring= Peer mentoring takes place in learning environments such as schools, usually between an older more experienced student and a new student.Steve Grbac, \\"How to implement a 'Peer Support’ program in a P-6 School,\\" Scotch College Junior School, Melbourne Australia; International Boys' Schools Coalition 15th Annual Conference, Toronto, Canada, June 2008. Peer mentors appear mainly in secondary schools where students moving up from primary schools may need assistance in settling into the whole new schedule and lifestyle of secondary school life. Peer mentoring is also used in the workplace as a means of orienting new employees. New employees who are paired with a peer mentor are twice as likely to remain in their job than those who do not receive mentorship. =Peer listening= This form of peer support is widely used within schools.Helen Cowie, Patti Wallace, Peer Support in Action: From Bystanding to Standing By, Sage Publications Ltd; 1st edition February 2001; Sandy Hazouri, Miriam Smith McLaughlin, Peer listening in the middle school: training activities for students. Educational Media Corp., 1991. Peer supporters are trained, normally from within schools or universities, or sometimes by outside organizations, such as Childline's CHIPS (Childline In Partnership With Schools) program,Chrissan Moldrich and J.D. Carpentieri, \\"Every school should have one: How peer support schemes make schools better\\", ChildLine, January 2008, . to be \\"active listeners\\".Joel H. Brown, Marianne D'Emidio-Caston, Bonnie Benard, Resilience Education, Corwin Press, 2001. Within schools, peer supporters are normally available at break or lunch times. =Peer mediation= Peer mediation is a means of handling incidents of bullying by bringing the victim and the bully together under mediation by one of their peers.Cheryl Sanders (Editor), Gary D. Phye (Editor), Bullying: Implications for the Classroom, Academic Press; 1st edition May 14, 2004; .\\"Creating a Positive Climate: Peer Mediation; What Works in Preventing School Violence.\\"Cremin, Hilary, Peer Mediation: Citizenship and Social Inclusion in Action. Maidenhead: Open University Press, September 2007; . =Peer helper in sports= A peer helper in sports works with young adults in sports such as football, soccer, track, volleyball, baseball, cheerleading, swimming, and basketball. They may provide help with game tactics (e.g. keeping your eye on the ball), emotional support, training support, and social support.John DeMarco, Peer helping skills: a leader's guide to training peer helpers and peer tutors for middle and high school. Hazelden Publishing, 1993. Gray, H. D. and J. A. Tindall (1985). Peer counseling: An in-depth look at training peer helpers. Muncie, Ind., Accelerated Development. In health =In mental health= Peer support can occur within, outside or around traditional mental health services and programs, between two people or in groups. Peer support is increasingly being offered through digital health like text messaging and smartphone apps.Fortuna KL, Venegas M, Umucu E, Mois G, Walker R, MS, Brooks JM. The Future of Peer Support in Digital Psychiatry: Promise, Progress and Opportunities. Current Treatment Options in Psychiatry. 2019; 1-11. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40501-019-00179-7 Peer support is a key concept in the recovery approach and in consumer-operated services programs. Consumers/clients of mental health programs have also formed non- profit self-help organizations, and serve to support each other and to challenge associated stigma and discrimination. The role of peer workers in mental health services was the subject of a conference in London in April 2012, jointly organized by the Centre for Mental Health and the NHS Confederation.http://www.nhsconfed.org/Networks/MentalHealth/events/recent_events/Pages/mh- peer-support.aspx. Research has shown that peer-run self-help groups yield improvement in psychiatric symptoms resulting in decreased hospitalization, larger social support networks and enhanced self-esteem and social functioning.\\"Peer Support Research: A Promising New Approach.\\" There is considerable variety in the ways that peer support is defined and conceptualized as it relates to mental health services. In some cases, clinicians, psychiatrists, and other staff who do not necessarily have their own experiences of receiving psychiatric treatment are being trained, often by psychiatric survivors, in peer support as an approach to building relationships that are genuine, mutual, and non-coercive. For anxiety and depression In Canada, the LEAF (Living Effectively with Anxiety and Fear) Program is a peer-led support group for cognitive-behavioral therapy of persons with mild to moderate panic disorders.Shelley Jones, \\"The LEAF Program: Peer-led Group CBT\\", Visions: BC's Mental Health and Addictions Journal, Vol 6, no. 1 2009, pp. 16-17. In a 2011 meta-analysis of seven randomized trials that compared a peer support intervention to group cognitive-behavioral therapy in patients suffering from depression, peer support interventions were found to improve depression symptoms more than usual care alone and results may be comparable to those of group cognitive behavioral therapy. These findings suggest that peer support interventions have the potential to be effective components of depression care, and they support the inclusion of peer support in recovery-oriented mental health treatment. Several studies have shown that peer support reduces fear during stressful situations such as combatSolomon, Z., and Oppenheimer, B. (1986). \\"Social network variables and stress-reaction lessons from the 1973 Yom-Kippur War.\\" Milit. Med. 151; pp. 12-15. and domestic violence and may mitigate Posttraumatic stress disorder. The 1982 Vietnam-Era Veterans Adjustment Survey showed that PTSD was highest in those men and women who lacked positive social support from family, friends, and society in general. For first responders Peer support programs have also been implemented to address stress and psychological trauma among law-enforcement personnelRachelle Katz, Daniel I. Cohen and Ronnie M.

Other programs have been designed for female victims of domestic violence and for women in prison. Survivor Corps defines peer support for trauma survivors as \\"Encouragement and assistance provided by a colleague who has overcome similar difficulties to engender self-confidence and autonomy and to enable the survivor to make his or her own decisions and implement them.\\"Jerry White, I Will Not Be Broken, (published in paperback as Getting Up When Life Knocks You Down,).

A study of 470 amputee survivors of war-related violence in six countries showed that nearly one hundred percent said they had benefited from peer support.Macauley C, Townsend M, Freeman M, Maxwell B. \\"Peer Support and Recovery from Limb Loss in Post- Conflict Settings,\\" Journal of ERW and Mine Action, Issue 15.2, Summer 2011, pp. 17-20. A peer support program operated by the Centre d’Encadrement et de Développement des Anciens Combattants in Burundi with support from the Center for International Stabilization and Recovery and Action on Armed Violence has assisted survivors of war-related violence, including women with disabilities,Macauley C. \\"Healing the Wounds of War: Victim Assistance in Post-Conflict Burundi.\\" Journal of ERW and Mine Action, Issue 16.3, Fall 2012: pp 24-26. and female ex-combatantsMacauley, C.

Peer support has been recommended as a fundamental part of victim assistance programs for survivors of war-related violence.Rutherford K and Macauley C. \\"The Power of Peers: Rethinking Victim Assistance,\\" The Journal of ERW and Mine Action, Issue 17.3 Fall 2013. A 1984 study on the impact of peer support and support groups for victims of domestic violence showed that 146 battered women found women's peer support groups the most helpful source of a range of available treatments. The women in these groups appeared to give direct advice and to act as role models. A 1986 study on 70 adolescent mothers considered to be at risk for domestic violence showed that peer support improved cognitive problem-solving skills, self-reinforcement, and parenting competence. Pandora's Aquarium, an online support group operating as part of Pandora's Project, offers peer support to survivors of rape and sexual abuse and their friends and family. =In addiction= Twelve-step programs for overcoming substance misuse and other addiction recovery groups are often based on peer support.Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, \\"What are Peer Recovery Support Services?\\" HHS Publication No. (SMA) 09-4454. Rockville, MD: Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2009. Since the 1930s Alcoholics Anonymous has promoted peer support between new members and their sponsors: \\"The process of sponsorship is this: an alcoholic who has made some progress in the recovery program shares that experience on a continuous, individual basis with another alcoholic who is attempting to attain or maintain sobriety through AA.\\"Questions & Answers on Sponsorship\\", Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc. 2005, p. 7.\\" Other addiction recovery programs rely on peer support without following the twelve- step model.Sherman, B.

Development of family and peer support groups: a handbook on addiction recovery issues. CPDAP, Colombo. =In chronic illness= Peer support has been beneficial for many people living with diabetes. Diabetes encompasses all aspects of people's lives, often for decades. Support from peers can offer emotional, social, and practical assistance that helps people do the things they need to do to stay healthy. Peer support groups for diabetics complement and enhance other health care services.Michelle Heisler, \\"Building Peer Support Programs to Manage Chronic Disease: Seven Models for Success\\", California Healthcare Foundation, December 2006.

The Breast Cancer Network of Strength trains peer counselors to work with breast cancer survivors.BCNS's Breast Cancer Survivor Match Program =For people with disabilities= Peer support is considered to be a key component of the independent living movement and has been widely used by organizations that work with people with disabilities, including the Amputee Coalition of America (ACA) and Survivor Corps. Since 1998 the ACA has operated a National Peer Network for survivors of limb loss. The Blinded Veterans Association has recently launched Operation Peer Support (OPS), a program designed to support men and women returning to the US blinded or experiencing significant visual impairment in connection with their military service. Peer support has also benefited survivors of traumatic brain injury and their families. There is also FacingDisability for Families Facing Spinal Cord Injuries , which has a peer counseling program in addition to 1,000 videos drawn from interviews of people with spinal cord injuries, their families, caregivers and experts. =For veterans and their families= Several programs exist that provide peer support for military veterans in the USVets4Vets, a non-partisan organization dedicated to helping Iraq and Afghanistan-era veterans to heal from the psychological injuries of war through the use of peer support.Statewide Advocacy for Veterans' Empowerment (SAVE)Resnick, Sandra Gail; Rosenheck, Robert A: \\"Integrating peer-provided services: a quasi-experimental study of recovery orientation, confidence, and empowerment,\\" Psychiatric Services, vol. 59, no. 11, pp. 1307-1314, November 2008. and Canada.The Operational Stress Injury Social Support (OSISS) Program for Canadian Veterans.

In 2010 the Military Women to Women Peer Support Group was established in Helena, MT.Eve Byron, \\"Helena area is home to 1st 'Military Women to Women Peer Support Group’ for those with PTSD,\\" Independent Record, The Billings Gazette, August 3, 2010. The Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS) provides peer support, crisis care, casualty casework assistance, and grief and trauma resources for families of members of the US military. Operation Peer Support (OPS) is a program for US military veterans who were blinded or have significant visual impairment. In January 2013 Senator Patty Murray, Chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, sponsored an amendment of the National Defense Authorization Act (S.3254) that would require peer counseling as part of a comprehensive suicide prevention program for US veterans.\\"MILITARY SUICIDE: Murray Effort to Create Standardized Suicide Prevention Program Signed into Law by President Obama.\\" For veterans with PTSD Peer support outreach for those exposed to traumatic events refers to programs that seek to identify and reach out to those suffering from or at risk for mental health problems following a traumatic event as a means of connecting those people to mental health services. Paraprofessional peers are defined as having a shared background as the target population and work closely with and supplement the services of the mental healthcare team. These peers are trained in certain interventions (such as Psychological First Aid) and are closely supervised by professional mental healthcare personnel. Peer support for recovery from PTSD refers to programs in which someone with lived experience of PTSD, who experienced a significant reduction in symptoms, provides formal services to those who have not yet made significant steps in recovery from his or her condition. The peer support for recovery model focuses on improvement in overall health and wellness, and has long been successful in the treatment of SMI (serious mental illness) but is relatively new for PTSD. A further review of existing literature found that carefully recruited, trained, supervised, and supported paraprofessionals can deliver mental health interventions effectively, and may be valuable in communities with fewer resources for mental healthcare. Researchers at the Palo Alto VA National Center for PTSD also conducted focus groups at the VA Palo Alto Health Care System Trauma Recovery Programs, a PTSD Residential Rehabilitation Program, and a Women's Trauma Recovery Program to determine veteran and staff perceptions of informal peer support interventions already in place. Four themes were identified, including \\"peer support contributing to a feeling of social connectedness\\", \\"positive role modeling by the peer support provider\\", \\"peer support augmenting care offered by professional providers\\", and \\"peer supporter acting as a 'culture broker' and orienting recipients to mental health treatment.\\" These findings have been put into practice through a peer support program for veterans in the Sonora, Stockton, and Modesto VA outpatient clinics. The clinics are part of the Palo Alto Veterans Affairs Healthcare System that extend to more rural parts of northern California. The program is funded through grants in support of new treatment approaches to serve veterans in rural, traditionally underserved areas. Leadership for the program comes from the Menlo Park division of the Palo Alto VA system. The peer support program has been operational since 2012 with over 268 unique veterans seen between 2012 and 2015. The two peer support providers involved in the program are veterans of the Vietnam and Iraq wars, respectively, and after having recovered from their own mental health disorders utilize their experiences to help their fellow veterans. The two providers have been responsible for leading between 5 and 7 groups each week as well as conducting telephone outreach and one-on-one engagement visits. These services have successfully helped to augment the often overburdened mental health treatment teams at the central valley outpatient VA clinics. The peer support program has been described in several publications. A personal story of success was featured in Stanford Medicine magazine and the collaborative nature of the program was described in the recently published book, Partnerships for Mental Health. = For people at work = Trauma risk management (TRiM) is a work-place based peer support for use in helping to protect the mental health of employees who have been exposed to traumatic stress. The TRiM process enables non-healthcare staff to monitor and manage colleagues. TRiM peer support training provides TRiM Practitioners with a background understanding of psychological trauma and its effects. TRiM was developed in the UK by military mental health professionals including Professor Neil Greenberg. There have been numerous scientific publications into the use of TRiM which have demonstrated it to be an acceptable and effective method of peer support. Similar to TRiM, the sustaining resilience at work (StRaW) peer support system is delivered by trained peers who are able to assist colleagues exposed to significant non- traumatic stressors, originating either at work or at home, and either support and mentor them or help them access professional support. StRaW was developed by March on Stress Ltd and early research again shows it to be a credible and effective way of supporting staff at work. =Sex workers= Several peer based organisations exist for sex workers. The aim of these organisations is to support the health, rights and well being of sex workers and advocate on their behalf for law reform in order to make working safer. Sex work is work and there are many people who willingly choose it as a job/career. While sex trafficking does exist, not everyone who does sex work is doing so under duress. Social stigma is a major hurdle sex workers encounter, with many people trying to 'save' them. Peer support workers and peer educators are seen as best practice by the Sex Industry Network (SIN) when engaging with community members because peers can understand that someone could willingly choose to do sex work.

The product is an example of an anatomic chair, as the shape of the object is set by the user.  History  Sacco was introduced in 1968 by three Italian designers: Piero Gatti, Cesare Paolini and Franco Teodoro. The object was created in the Italian Modernism movement. Being a post war era phenomenon, Italian modernism’s design was highly inspired with new available technology. Post war technology allowed an increase in the processes of production, by introducing new materials such as polystyrene. The idea of mass-produced goods made within an inexpensive price range appealed to consumers. It therefore created the need for a revolution in the creative and manufacturing process. ‘The designer was an integral member of a process that included marketing as well as engineering’. The inspiration left by Corradino D’Ascano’s Vespa design for the Piaggio Corporation in 1946, added value to the essence of the designer. With successful designs, brands could sell more products, and therefore the identity of the designer played an important advertising role. Another important figure of the Italian modernism period was Gio Ponti. Inspired by modernism's art movements, Ponti created new forms of objects. His asymmetrically balanced designs freed the Italian objects form their classic representations. The designer promoted Italian designs on famous exhibitions called 'Milan Triennale': \\"These exhibitions, organized as early as the 1920s … were responsible for increasing the visibility of Italian design in an international setting\\". After becoming an editor of the Domus (magazine) in 1947, Ponti contributed to not only Italian design of that time, but also : “the human and creative element in modern industrial design as well as its practical, economic and social benefits.\\" Piero Gatti, Cesare Paolini and Franco Teodoro, inspired by their designer predecessors, came up in 1968 with the design of Sacco the ‘shapeless chair’. Although it was not the first design of an amorphous chair in Italian history, Sacco was the first successful product created in partnership with Zanotta. The predecessor of the product had a major design flaw of not being able to sustain its form and therefore never reached production. Sacco picked up that flaw and with the use of leather for exterior and right placed stitching. It is worth mentioning that the use of leather was not coincidental as at that time the textile was an Italian national pride product. The target user of the chair was the lax, hippie community and their non-conformist household. \\"In an era characterized by the hippie culture, apartment sharing and student demonstrations, the thirty-something designers created a nonpoltrona (non-chair) and thus launched an attack on good bourgeois taste.\\" Sacco is part of the permanent collection of the most important museums of contemporary art throughout the world, such as the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Centre Pompidou in Paris and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Sacco was part of the 1972 exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York Italy: The New Domestic Landscape - Achievements and Problems of Italian Design and was awarded, in 1973, the BIO 5 at the Biennale of Design in Ljubljana. Piero Gatti, Cesare Paolini and Franco Teodoro established their architecture firm in Turin in 1965.

Schulz. Other bean bag chair products inspired by Sacco Other designers have followed the \\"shapeless\\" chair design, creating a range of inspired products that take after Sacco. Amongst many, the most successful contemporary model would be Jukka Setala’s Fatboy. The product launched in 2002 brought the Finnish designer global recognition. The new form of the bean bag chair has less stitching and a more geometrical take in the means of shape. It also has an EPS filling which is more durable than PVC.

NewIcons was first invented and developed by the Italian programmer Nicola Salmoria. Subsequent development was done by Eric Sauvageau and Phil Vedovatti. History The need for NewIcons arose from the poor overall quality of icons in AmigaOS versions prior to 3.0. While the AmigaOS GUI had been revolutionary when it was first launched in the early 1980s, other operating systems such as Mac OS and Microsoft Windows quickly caught on and started to become more professional-looking. Standard AmigaOS Workbench icons were plain and uninteresting: limited to four colours, having no standard size, and viewed from a straight-on perspective that left them looking two- dimensional. The aim of NewIcons is to solve all these faults. Unlike a standard Workbench icon, which only includes palette index information and is thus at the mercy of the user's chosen Workbench palette, NewIcons icons are natively drawn in 32 colours (5-bit colour) and hold the actual RGB colour information in the icon file. A memory-resident program (called a Commodity in Amiga terminology) tries its best to adapt the icon's colours into the current Workbench screen palette. Up to 256 colour icons are supported by NewIcons system. Features NewIcons also establishes a standard icon size of 36×40 pixels, similar to those of Mac OS and Windows. The design guidelines recommend icons to be drawn at a more diagonal perspective, thus creating the illusion of three dimensions. The guidelines also strongly encourage the use of Workbench's \\"image\\" highlights, where a selected image changes its actual shape when clicked, instead of simply inverting its colours or becoming a darker shade. For example, a computer terminal could have its screen powered up, a pen could write letters on paper, or a robot symbolising a computer game could move around. NewIcons are relatively large in file size compared to conventional Amiga icons or MagicWB icons. NewIcons are stored in 8-bit data even when only few colours were used. Image data is encoded in ASCII to application metadata consuming even more space for an icon. =DefIcons= NewIcons also includes DefIcons, a package of ready-made icons which aims to provide a default icon image for all files that do not have their own associated icons (provided as \`.info\` files in AmigaOS). DefIcons uses a scheme that actually examines the file's contents instead of simply looking at the filename extension to determine the file type. This approach is slower than the file extension system used by Microsoft Windows, but ultimately more accurate; a PNG image file with a .JPG extension will appear with a PNG- specific icon.Vedovatti, P: NewIcons Documentation. 1999 GlowIcons AmigaOS 3.5 introduced GlowIcons icon format and supported NewIcons without need of third-party applications. The GlowIcons format, based on NewIcons file format, is the native icon format used in AmigaOS 3.5, 3.9 and 4.0 by Matt Chaput. The major difference to NewIcons is how image data is stored. NewIcons uses inefficient ASCII encoding embedded to the application Tool Type metadata. In GlowIcons system developers extended internal icon definition without need to resort to storing information as Tool Types. The standard icon size is 46×46 pixels with maximum 256 (8-bit) colors and two image states (example: open and closed drawers). The second image state uses a glow effect to indicate that the icon is pressed. Starting with the \\"Final Update\\" AmigaOS 4.0 supports 32 bit icon images.

For a road to become a special road, it must have a Statutory Instrument sanctioned under the Highways Act 1980. A road which is not a special road is termed an all-purpose road. The vast majority of the roads in the UK are all-purpose roads. Most special roads are motorways. The Special Roads Act 1949 The passing of the Special Roads Act 1949 through Parliament allowed the UK to construct roads that were not automatically rights of way for certain types of user. All previous roads were automatically rights of way for all road users, including pedestrians, so it was not possible to build roads designated only for motorized traffic. The Act therefore allowed the construction of motorways. The Special Roads Act was merged in with the Highways Act 1959, and later the Highways Act 1980 =The first special road= The Special Roads Act was first used in late-1950s to designate the Preston By-pass in Preston, Lancashire, now largely part of the M6 motorway, as a special road. Non-motorway special roads Although the majority of special roads in the UK are also motorways, there are a number of special roads that are not motorways. Quite a number of these are toll bridges, and several others are former motorways which have since been downgraded. In order to charge a toll on a newly built road, special road regulations are usually necessary. In addition, a small number of non-motorway special roads are relatively newly built dual-carriageway roads, such as the A1 Dual Carriageway east of Edinburgh and parts of the A720 Edinburgh bypass, or parts of the A55 in North Wales. These particular roads have many of the same regulations as motorways, apart from the speed limit regulations, since that only applies to special roads which are also motorways. The usual speed limit regulations that apply to all-purpose roads do not apply to special roads, so a non-motorway special road must define a speed limit as part of its Statutory Instrument.

Patterson's art deco magazine illustrations helped develop and promote the idea of the 1920s and 1930s fashion style known as the flapper. Russell H. Patterson was born in Omaha, Nebraska. Although he claimed he knew at age 17 that he wanted to be a magazine cover artist, he took a circuitous route to his ultimate success in that field. His family left his hometown of Omaha and settled in Montreal when he was still a boy. He studied architecture briefly at McGill University, then became an undistinguished cartoonist for some newspapers in Montreal, contributing Pierre et Pierrette to La Patrie. Rejected by the Canadian army at the start of World War I, he moved to Chicago to become a catalog illustrator. His early career included interior design for department stores like Carson Pirie Scott & Company and Marshall Field. A trip to Paris gave him the opportunity to paint and attend life-drawing classes. However, it also left him in debt, and so he reluctantly returned to the dull work of advertising art in Chicago. From 1916 to 1919, he intermittently attended the Art Institute of Chicago. From 1922 to 1925, Patterson, as Charles N. Landon had done before, distributed a mail-order art instruction course. Consisting of 20 lessons, it was called \\"The Last Word in Humorous Illustrations\\" (despite the finality suggested by that title, he afterwards contributed to the instruction books of the Art Instruction Schools). In 1924, Patterson made an attempt to carve out a living as a fine artist. Traveling to the Southwest with his paintings, however, he found the art galleries indifferent to his work.Top Hats and Flappers: The Art of Russell Patterson (Fantagraphics, 2006), edited by Shane Glines and Alex Chun. Foreword by Armando Mendez.Bell, John. Invaders from the North: How Canada Conquered the Comic Book Universe, Dundurn Press Ltd., 2006 , , pp. 26–27 Illustration Life (March 10, 1927). In 1925, having arrived in New York City, Patterson suddenly found his direction. He put aside his fine arts ambitions and turned his talents toward illustration. Drawing on his experience sketching beautiful women in Paris, he began adorning covers and interiors for magazines like College Humor and Judge, and later Life and Ballyhoo with his vivacious flappers. Within a couple of years, Russell Patterson the illustrator went from obscurity to celebrity, at a time when the leading graphic artists were as famous as movie stars. As his career blossomed, his ubiquitous version of the modern Jazz Age woman graced the covers and interior pages of The Saturday Evening Post, Vogue, Vanity Fair, Cosmopolitan, Redbook and Photoplay, among many other magazines. As celebrated at that time as the \\"Gibson Girl\\" had been years before, his \\"Patterson Girl\\" was, in the words of Armando Mendez, \\"simultaneously brazen and innocent.\\" By incorporating the day's faddish \\"raccoon coats and flapping, unbuckled galoshes in his drawings, Patterson became a pacemaker in setting styles.\\" Women of the time turned to Patterson's work to follow trends in clothing, jewelry and cosmetics. Martha H. Kennedy cites Patterson's dependence on the \\"graphic power of elegant, outlined forms, linear patterns of clothing and trailing smoke to compose strongly decorative, eye-catching designs.\\"Martha H. Kennedy, Exhibition Curator, Library of Congress: American Beauties: Drawings from the Golden Age of Illustration In the late 1930s he was designing Christmas toy windows for In 1940 he took on a job from, creating a promotional item called \\"The Great Map of New York\\" (Patterson had just prior begun a run of five annual R.H. Macy & Co. Christmas-toy window designs). The large map was illuminated and captioned in a style that evoked such charts from the Age of Discovery. Text on the map described it as \\"A chart neither too literal nor too emotional, shewing the city New York replete with the wondrous Spectacles, Mysteries, and Pastimes of the natives... Done in the year of the New York World's Fair – 1939.\\" Broadway Branching out from magazine illustration, Patterson worked on Broadway on a number of productions in various creative capacities: The Gang's All Here (1931) as Costume Designer; Ballyhoo of 1932 (1932) as Costume Designer, Director and Scenic Designer; Hold Your Horses (1933) as Costume Designer and Scenic Designer; Fools Rush In (1934) as Scenic Designer; Ziegfeld Follies of 1934 as Costume Designer; and George White's Scandals (1936) as Scenic Designer.BroadwayWorld International Database Films One of Patterson's rough scenic designs, for the film Give Me a Sailor (1938). He also worked in Hollywood for the silver screen. Patterson had an on-screen part playing himself in, and created lifelike dolls he called \\"Personettes\\" for, the film Artists and Models, which starred Jack Benny (four other cartoonists including Rube Goldberg also appeared).Lou Brooks at Drawger A New York Times movie reviewer wrote on August 5, 1937, \\"the appearance of the 'Personettes' struck me as satire of a high order. The puppets, you see, have a production number of their own… It seemed to me to be the perfect spoof of the usual song-and-dance interlude, proving how unnecessary it really is and how easy to duplicate (in fact, improve upon) with dolls.\\" Patterson was art director on Stand Up and Cheer! (1934), and designed costumes and dance sets for Bottoms Up (1934). He also designed scenes and costumes for other films such as the Bob Hope and Martha Raye vehicle, Give Me a Sailor (1938). He designed Shirley Temple's wardrobe for her film, Baby, Take a Bow (1934). Russell Patterson's Mamie (December 13, 1953) Comic strips In 1929 Patterson began illustrating Sunday newspaper magazine cover series for the Hearst chain. Among the series was \\"Runaway Ruth\\" (1929), \\"Wings of Love\\" (1929–30), \\"Get-Your-Man Gloria\\" (c.1932), \\"The Countess & the Cowboy\\" (c. 1932), and \\"Carolyn's Cadet\\" (c. 1932). Each series ran for several months, and Patterson produced these on a semi-regular basis until 1933. Patterson returned to the newspaper fold as the 1940s approached. He collaborated with writers Carolyn Wells and Percy Shaw on several series for the American Weekly Hearst Sunday magazine, all featuring the character Flossy Frills. These full- page works ran as front covers on the magazine from late 1939 to 1943 or after. Patterson's was perhaps the very last Sunday magazine comic strip series produced. From 1942-46 he produced a Sunday and daily panel cartoon series for Hearst's King Features Syndicate titled \\"Pin-Up Girls\\". In 1951, Patterson created the cartoon Mamie, a Sunday page for United Feature Syndicate. Mamie was part of a revival of the glamorous \\"dumb blonde\\" in comics, in the movies and on the stage.The Funnies, 100 Years of American Comic Strips, by Ron Goulart (Holbrook, Massachusetts: Adams Publishing, 1995). p. 58. The strip's beautiful lead was lovingly rendered, as was the New York City setting. Patterson added a panel of paper dolls to many of these Sunday comics. Maurice Horn called Mamie an \\"elegantly drawn, exquisitely composed page\\", but with \\"thin\\" humor, \\"a flapper strip that had somehow wandered into the wrong decade.\\" Still, it ran until 1956 on the strength of Patterson's art and fashion-sense.Horn, Maurice. 100 Years of American Newspaper Comics: An Illustrated Encyclopedia. New York: Gramercy Books, 1996. During the 1960s, arthritis began to limit his ability to draw. Patterson began mentoring younger artists as a faculty member of the National Institute of Art and Design. Legacy and awards \\"Where there's smoke there's fire\\" by Russell Patterson, an example of the \\"girl-goddess\\" that influenced many artists. Coulton Waugh gives much of the credit for the \\"creation of the lithe, full-breasted, long-legged American girl-goddess\\" to Patterson. Waugh notes Don Flowers' statement that his being an \\"ardent admirer\\" of Patterson should be readily apparent in his work.Waugh, Coulton. The Comics. New York: Luna P., 1974 (original copyright 1947). Flapper specialist Ethel Hays is also numbered among cartoonists influenced by Patterson, and E. Simms Campbell actually became a \\"girlie\\" cartoonist upon Russell Patterson's personal advice. Milton Caniff himself said that Patterson held a \\"king-pin place among illustrators,\\" and also said that it was Patterson who best defined the \\"strut and fret\\" of American life between the two World Wars. Armando Mendez concludes that \\"it can be said with confidence that Patterson's trademark girl touched virtually every girlie comic artist working between 1930 and 1960.\\" A beauty expert, Patterson judged Miss America contests from 1927 to 1945 and Miss Universe pageants from 1960 through 1963. A well-known costumer and fashion designer, he contributed ideas in the early 1940s for the uniform of the fledgling Women's Army Auxiliary Corps. He served as President of the National Cartoonist Society from 1952 to 1953. Patterson received the National Cartoonists Society's Advertising and Illustration Award for 1957 and the Elzie Segar Award in 1974. His fame and reputation were such that his endorsements of Medaglia D'Oro coffee, Rheingold Beer, and Lord Calvert whiskey were trumpeted in magazine advertisements.The Sandra & Gary Baden Collection of Celebrity Endorsements in Advertising, ca. 1897-1979 Russell Patterson died in Atlantic City of heart failure on March 17, 1977, as the Delaware Art Museum was preparing the first significant retrospective of his work. In 2006, Fantagraphics published Top Hats and Flappers: The Art of Russell Patterson, edited by Shane Glines and Alex Chun, with a foreword by Armando Mendez.

A standing frame provides alternative positioning to sitting in a wheelchair by supporting the person in the standing position.  Types and function  Common types of standers include: sit to stand, prone, supine, upright, multi-positioning standers, and standing wheelchairs. Long leg braces are also a standing device but not used often today. = Categories of standers: =  By mobility:  * Passive (static) stander: A passive stander remains in one place. They sometimes have casters, but cannot be self- propelled. * Mobile (dynamic) stander: User can self-propel a mobile stander if they have the strength to push a manual wheelchair. Some standers are also available with powered mobility. * Active stander: An active stander creates reciprocal movement of the arms legs while standing.  By type:  * Prone: Prone standers distribute the body weight to the front of the individual and usually have a tray in front of them. This makes them good for users who are actively trying to carry out some task. * Supine: Supine standers distribute the body weight to the back and are good for cases where the user has more limited mobility or is recovering from injury. * Sit-to- Stand: Sit-to-Stand devices are used to enable people in wheelchairs to stand without requiring other people to lift them in. This is more commonly used by adults than children because children are generally light enough for one person to lift them.  Diagnoses and users Standers are used by people with mild to severe disabilities such as spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, cerebral palsy, spina bifida, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, stroke, Rett syndrome, and post-polio syndrome. Spinal cord injury: Standers are used by people with both paraplegia and quadriplegia since a variety of support options are available to accommodate for mild to severe disabilities. Doug Betters and Mike Utley are both former NFL football players who are quadriplegics due to spinal cord injury. They both stand using active standers. Bone mineral loss and osteoporosis are common consequences after spinal cord injury. Therapeutic standing, a weight-bearing intervention that can be applied using a standing frame, has traditionally been incorporated into rehabilitation programs for those with chronic spinal cord injury in order to prevent osteoporosis. A systematic review of the literature conducted by Biering-Sorenson et al. (2009) shows that therapeutic standing in the chronic phase of injury, defined as one year after injury, has no effect on maintaining bone density. Results on the effectiveness of therapeutic standing during the first year of injury are conflicting and show that shorter, less aggressive intervention is less effective. If therapeutic standing is to be incorporated into treatment, it should be more aggressive and initiated in the early stages of injury if any beneficial impacts on bone mineral density are hoped to be achieved.  Common settings and applications  Standing devices are used in a variety of settings including: * In the home and workplace, * Early intervention centers, * Schools (special education classes or the inclusive classroom), adapted physical education classes, * Children's hospitals and therapy centers, * Rehabilitation facilities and hospitals, * Extended care units, nursing homes, assisted living centers and group homes, and veterans' hospitals. Obtaining a standing frame Funding (government funding or health insurance) for standing equipment is achievable in most developed countries, but usually requires medical justification and a letter of medical necessity (a detailed medical prescription) written by a physical therapist or medical professional.

It is arguably the first continuously published online science magazine in history. The founder-publisher was Edward Summer. The webzine was hosted by Interport, an early ISP in New York City that was eventually taken over by RCN. The Dinosaur Interplanetary Gazette covered news related to all the sciences, but paleontology in particular. Paleontology and dinosaurs were only an initial topic that led to all forms of related sciences and other fields: mathematics, physics, biology, sociology, literature, motion pictures.  Awards and International Readership  Although it was originally intended for younger readers, the style of writing apparently made it accessible to readers of all ages and it was popular literally worldwide. The publication received mail from readers in more than 159 countries. The magazine currently (July 2006) claims to have readers in 175 countries.See Country list at the bottom of this page. Over the initial five years of publication, it was recognized with more than 30 awards. It was recommended by the National Education Association (NEA) along with only one other science site published by Bill Nye The Science Guy. It was a featured website in Netscape, The New York Times, Natural History Magazine.  Pioneering Website  D.I.G. was one of the earliest websites to run continuous \\"public appearances\\" by working scientists. Organized through early \\"message boards,\\" a feature called \\"The Bone Zone\\" (tm) allowed the world's most famous paleontologists to receive and answer questions from the magazine's readers. More than two dozen renowned paleontologists, writers, artists and journalists participated in this early experiment in public education and entertainment.  Celluloid Dinosaurs  One of the most enduring features of The Dinosaur Interplanetary Gazette was Celluloid Dinosaurs. Celluloid Dinosaurs was a history not only of dinosaur movies, but also of the related arts and sciences. The feature took the viewpoint that dinosaurs as we know them in movies like Jurassic Park or King Kong are a product of the collaboration of many different sciences and literary disciplines. Dinosaurs exist only as fossils, so visualizing them on the screen (or in books) involves extensive research and imagination. This feature has been cited in university level textbooks and standard reference works in the field of paleontology.The Complete Dinosaur, by James O. Farlow, M.K.

It is the seat of the Bishop of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich and is in Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk. Originating in the 11th century, it was rebuilt in the 12th and 16th centuries as a parish church and became a cathedral in 1914; it has been considerably enlarged in recent decades. History A church has stood on the site of the cathedral since at least 1065, when St Denis's Church was built within the precincts of Bury St Edmunds Abbey. In the early 12th century the Abbot, Anselm had wanted to make a pilgrimage along the Way of St James to Santiago de Compostela. He was unsuccessful and instead rebuilt St Denis's and dedicated the new church to Saint James, which served as the parish church for the north side of Bury St Edmunds. Anselm was also responsible for building the abbey gate tower, known today as the Norman Tower, alongside St James's, which also served as the church's belfry and it continues in this function to the present day. This church was largely rebuilt, starting in 1503, in the Perpendicular style by John Wastell, a master mason who also worked on King's College, Cambridge. Further alterations to the building were undertaken in the 18th and 19th centuries, notably a new chancel and a hammerbeam roof by George Gilbert Scott. When the Diocese of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich was created in 1914, St James's Church was made the cathedral. In 1959 Benjamin Britten wrote the Fanfare for St Edmundsbury for a \\"Pageant of Magna Carta\\" held in the cathedral grounds. From 1959 onwards there was renewed building work designed to transform the former parish church into a cathedral building. Between 1959 and 1970, the Victorian chancel was demolished and replaced with a new quire, a cloister was added on the west side; also transepts, a Lady chapel and a side chapel dedicated to St Edmund were built. The cathedral architect from 1943 to 1988 was Stephen Dykes Bower and he left £2 million for the completion of the cathedral. In the cathedral grounds a new choir school and visitor's centre, which were opened in 1990, were built by Dykes Bower's successor, Alan Rome. Work started on a Gothic revival style tower in 2000; funded by the Millennium Commission, the Stephen Dykes Bower Trust and others, the Millennium Tower was designed by Hugh Mathew, an associate of Dykes Bower. The 150 foot (46 metre) structure was built from 600,000 bricks and faced with Barnack and Clipsham stone. Its completion was officially celebrated on 22 July 2005. Further additions are the Chapel of the Transfiguration and the East Cloister, both completed in 2009, and the Crypt Treasury in 2012.Pepin p. 196 Interior The font was designed in 1870 by George Gilbert Scott, constructed on a medieval shaft, with a cover by Frank Ernest Howard of Oxford. The decoration was added in 1960. A painting, \\"The Martyrdom of St Edmund\\" by Brian Whelan hangs in the Lady Chapel.Pepin p. 196 A sculpture by Elizabeth Frink entitled Crucifixion stands by the Treasury steps. Stained glass in the cathedral includes the medieval Susanna Window which has Flemish glass in the lower section and English glass at the top. The west window depicts the Last Judgement and dates from about 1900.Harris p. 59 In addition to guided tours of the cathedral itself, visitors can view changing exhibits of art in the Edmund Gallery, and an exhibit of historic and religious regalia and artefacts in the Cathedral Treasures display. Dean and chapter The Dean of St Edmundsbury is the head (primus inter pares — first among equals) and chair of the chapter of canons, the ruling body of the cathedral. Before 2000 the post was designated as a provost, which was then the equivalent of a dean at most English cathedrals. The first provost was John Orpen. , the clergy are:St Edmundsbury Cathedral — Members of Staff (Accessed 7 February 2019) *Dean — Joe Hawes (installed 14 July 2018)St Edmundsbury Cathedral — A New Dean (Accessed 15 March 2018) *Sub- Dean & Canon Pastor — Matthew Vernon (Sub-Dean since 18 November 2012 licensing;St Edmundsbury Cathedral — Appointment of Sub-Dean Canon Pastor since 8 February 2009)Emmanuel, Hong Kong — Installation of Canon Vernon *Canon Precentor — Philip Banks (since 19 February 2012 installation)St Edmundsbury & Ipswich — Former Chartered Surveyor to be Canon *Archdeacon for Rural Mission and Diocesan Canon — Sally Gaze (since 10 February 2019 installation) *Canon Theologian and Bishop's Chaplain (Diocesan Canon) — Mike Robinson (since 2 February 2020 installation) Organ and organists =Organ= The two organ cases, in the north transept and north choir Details of the organ from the National Pipe Organ Register =Director of Music= * 1896 Charles John Harold Shane * 1937 Edward Percy Hallam * 1958 Harrison Oxley * 1985 Paul Trepte * 1990 Mark Blatchly * 1993 Mervyn Cousins * 1997 James Thomas Bells A peal of 12 bells are located in the Norman Tower. The original ten bells were cast in 1785 by Thomas Osborn of Downham Market. In 1973 the bells were rehung in an iron frame at a lower level in the tower. Following a public appeal, a further two bells were added at Easter 2012. A thirteenth bell was added in 2013 which allows beginners to practice with a full octave, without having to use the three heaviest bells. The bells are rung on Sundays before the morning and evening services, and also for weddings and other special occasions.

Delaware is known as the \\"First State,\\" as referenced in their motto \\"First Regiment of First State.\\" The unit specializes in command post node communications, providing broadband satellite voice and data connections for brigade sized battlefield elements. The unit includes Headquarters, Headquarters Company located in Wilmington, DE; A Company in Georgetown, DE; B Company in Hodges, SC; and C Company in Wilmington, DE. It is one of several National Guard units with colonial roots and campaign credit for the War of 1812. History The 1st Delaware Regiment was raised on 9 December 1775 for service with the continental army under the command of Colonel John Haslet. Over the next 240 years, the regiment would see action during the Revolutionary War, War of 1812, Civil War, World War I, World War II, and the Global War on Terrorism. Since its inception, the 198th has served as Infantry, Coast Artillery, Anti-Aircraft Artillery and Signal. The unit's lineage and honors include 36 battle streamers from nearly every major war in US history. Although many 198th Soldiers volunteered for service in Korea and Vietnam, the unit was activated in August 1950 for service during the Korean War. The unit was assigned in 1951 through 1952 to defend the Washington and Baltimore Air Defense sectors. During this assignment many of these men were \\"pipelined\\" to the Korean War. The unit also saw extensive deployments during World War I and World War II, and again in support of the Global War on Terrorism, most recently in 2013–2014 to Kandahar, Afghanistan. This marked the first time since the Civil War that the 198th deployed as a full Battalion with its South Carolina based B Company. To honor this event, the 198th's Headquarters facility on Kandahar Air Field was named \\"Camp Cowpens,\\" after the Battle of Cowpens in South Carolina during the Revolutionary War.

It was significant in the history of education in England, supporting free British Schools and teacher training in the 19th century; it continued in the latter role until the 1970s. In the 19th century it fiercely competed with the National Society for Promoting Religious Education, which had the support of the established Church of England, the local parishes, and Oxford and Cambridge universities. Both institutions promoted the monitorial system, whereby few paid teachers supervise the senior students who in turn taught the younger students. David Taylor, Mastering economic and social history (1988) pp 278–80. Current status As its teacher training colleges have closed and the Society has gathered more capital, it has used its funds to provide grants for educational projects around the world. Details of its activities can be found in its Annual Reports and the rest of its website.The British & Foreign School Society Archives and museum The Society's Archive Centre is situated close to Brunel University's Uxbridge campus. This holds school and college records, together with artefacts and curriculum materials with relevance to modern education.British and Foreign School Society Collection, Brunel University, London. The British Schools Museum is set in a cluster of school buildings on a site in Hitchin, Hertfordshire, dating from 1810, when a Lancasterian School was founded. The Lancasterian Schools were taken over by the British and Foreign School Society. The British Schools buildings remaining in Hitchin include a unique Lancasterian Schoolroom (1837), a Galleried Classroom 1853 and other buildings from 1857 and 1905. The Hitchin British Schools Trust runs the museum for public visitors and for classes of visiting children to sample education in the 19th century.British Schools Museum  History  Joseph Lancaster's School in Borough Road, Southwark, London, established in 1798, was an important development in the provision of universal free education for children. A teacher training institution, Borough Road College, was added soon afterwards in 1801. The Lancasterian system (or monitorial system) used older children who had already been given some education to teach the younger children. It was designed to provide a cheap basic education with limited resources and numbers of teachers. The Society for Promoting the Lancasterian System for the Education of the Poor was formed in 1808 to continue Lancaster's lead. The Society was founded by Joseph Fox, William Allen and Samuel Whitbread. It was supported by several evangelical and non-conformist Christians, including William Wilberforce. In 1814, the Society was renamed the British and Foreign School Society for the Education of the Labouring and Manufacturing Classes of Society of Every Religious Persuasion. During the 19th century, based on non-sectarian principles, the Society started a number of \\"British Schools\\" and teacher training institutions, which in many places maintained an active rivalry with the \\"National Schools\\" of the Established Church. It also established schools abroad, helping with the provision of staff and other support. When the government assumed responsibility for elementary education with the Elementary Education Act 1870, the British schools became locally administered board schools. The BFSS continued its role by supporting teacher training institutions for the next century, but these institutions have now closed or merged with other colleges. In particular, Borough Road College, having moved from Borough Road to Isleworth in west London, merged with the West London Institute of Higher Education in 1976. This in turn became part of Brunel University in 1995.History of the BFSS, British and Foreign School Society.

(2004) concluded that Dinodocus is a nomen dubium.Upchurch, P., Barrett, P.M. and Dodson, P. 2004. Sauropoda. In The Dinosauria, 2nd edition. D. Weishampel, P. Dodson, and H. Osmólska (eds.). University of California Press, Berkeley. Pp. 259–322. Discovery and naming The holotype was discovered in 1840 by Mr H. B. Mackeson. In 1841, Richard Owen noted on the fossils. The holotype, NHMUK 14695, was listed by Owen as \\"portions of the corocoid, humerus and ulna, iliac, ischial and pubic bones, a large portion of the shaft of a femur, parts of a tibia and fibula, and several metatarsal bones\\". Owen assigned the specimen to the pliosaur Polyptychodon.Owen R (1841) \\"Report on British Fossil Reptiles. Part II\\". Page 195. Report of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, 11th Meeting (1841). In 1850, Gideon Mantell assigned the specimen to PelorosaurusPaleobiology Database on Pelorosaurus but Richard Owen placed the fossils in a separate genus, Dinodocus, in 1884. In 1908, Dinodocus was synonymized with Pelorosaurus again, this time by Arthur Smith Woodward.Woodward A S (May 1908) \\"Note on Dinodocus mackesoni, a cetiosaurian from the Lower Greensand of Kent\\". Geological Magazine 5(5): 204-206. In 2004, Paul Upchurch validated the genus Dinodocus.

Verlag Dr. G. Borotha-Schoeler) King Solomon's Ring is a zoological book for the general audience, written by the Austrian scientist Konrad Lorenz in 1949. The first English-language edition appeared in 1952. The book's title refers to the legendary Seal of Solomon, a ring that supposedly gave King Solomon the power to speak to animals. Lorenz claims that he likewise achieved this feat of communication with several species. He accomplished this by raising them in and around his home and observing their behavior. King Solomon's Ring describes the methods of his investigation, and his resulting findings about animal psychology. Lorenz's findings include the surprisingly refined social system of the common Eurasian jackdaw, the uncanny behavior and bodily features of the tiny water shrew, and the surprisingly complex interactions of seemingly unintelligent aquarium fish. He interlards his narrative with anecdotes based on his unusual methods, without which he could not have made many of his observations. King Solomon's Ring dispels several common misconceptions about animals' intelligence, but at the same time points out many of their similarities with humans, although some of these similarities come from speculative extrapolations (in fact, Lorenz has been criticized for excessive anthropomorphism). King Solomon's Ring also addresses the issue of keeping pets. Lorenz praises the benefits that a pet owner derives from his pet, however, he also describes the hazards that an animal can pose to the inhabitants and material contents of a house, and the ways in which a pet's captivity can make it miserable, and explains how to avoid each of these causes for discontent. A few of the findings it presents have found their way into common knowledge since its publication, such as the phenomenon of imprinting. , it has been printed at least six times in English, and is still being published.

Astronomers divide these into grids to use them more easily. They are used to identify and locate constellations and astronomical objects such as stars, nebulae, and galaxies. They have been used for human navigation since time immemorial. Note that a star chart differs from an astronomical catalog, which is a listing or tabulation of astronomical objects for a particular purpose. Tools utilizing a star chart include the astrolabe and planisphere. History Museo Archeologico Nazionale, Naples =Prehistory= A variety of archaeological sites and artifacts found are thought to indicate ancient made star charts. The oldest known star chart may be a carved ivory Mammoth tusk drawn by early people from Asia that moved into Europe, that was discovered in Germany in 1979. This artifact is 32,500 years old and has a carving that resembles the constellation Orion, although it could not be confirmed and could also be a pregnancy chart. German researcher Dr Michael Rappenglueck, of the University of Munich, has suggested that drawing on the wall of the Lascaux caves in France could be a graphical representation of the Pleiades open cluster of stars. This is dated from 33,000 to 10,000 years ago. He also suggested a panel in the same caves depicting a charging bison, a man with a bird's head and the head of a bird on top of a piece of wood, together may depict the Summer Triangle, which at the time was a circumpolar formation. Rappenglueck also discovered a drawing of the Northern Crown constellation in the cave of El Castillo (North of Spain), made in the same period as the Lascaux chart. Another star chart panel, created more than 21,000 years ago, was found in the La Tête du Lion cave (fr). The bovine in this panel may represent the constellation Taurus, with a pattern representing the Pleiades just above it. A star chart drawn 5000 years ago by the Indias in Kashmir, which also depict a supernova for the first time in human history.http://www.tifr.res.in/~archaeo/papers/Prehistoric%20astronomy/Oldest%20Supernova%20record%20in%20Kashmir.pdfhttps://soundcloud.com/theintersection/48-the- stories-in-our-stars-tribal-astronomy-in-ancient-india The Nebra sky disk, a 30 cm wide bronze disk dated to 1600 BC, bears gold symbols generally interpreted as a sun or full moon, a lunar crescent, several stars including the Pleiades cluster and possibly the Milky Way. =Antiquity= The oldest accurately dated star chart appeared in ancient Egyptian astronomy in 1534 BC. The earliest known star catalogues were compiled by the ancient Babylonian astronomers of Mesopotamia in the late 2nd millennium BC, during the Kassite Period (ca. 1531–1155 BC). The oldest records of Chinese astronomy date to the Warring States period (476–221 BC), but the earliest preserved Chinese star catalogues of astronomers Shi Shen and Gan De are found in the 2nd-century BC Shiji by the Western Han historian Sima Qian. The oldest Chinese graphical representation of the night sky is a lacquerware box from the 5th-century BC Tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng, although this depiction shows the positions of the Chinese constellations by name and does not show individual stars. The Farnese Atlas is a 2nd-century AD Roman copy of a Hellenistic era Greek statue depicting the Titan Atlas holding the celestial sphere on his shoulder. It is the oldest surviving depiction of the ancient Greek constellations, and includes grid circles that provide coordinate positions. Because of precession, the positions of the constellations slowly change over time. By comparing the positions of the 41 constellations against the grid circles, an accurate determination can be made of the epoch when the original observations were performed. Based upon this information, the constellations were catalogued at . This evidence indicates that the star catalogue of the 2nd- century BC Greek astronomer Hipparchus was used. A Roman era example of a graphical representation of the night sky is the Ptolemaic Egyptian Dendera zodiac, dating from 50 BC. This is a bas relief sculpting on a ceiling at the Dendera Temple complex. It is a planisphere depicting the zodiac in graphical representations. However, individual stars are not plotted. =Medieval= The oldest surviving manuscript star chart was the Dunhuang Star Chart, dated to the Tang dynasty (618–907) and discovered in the Mogao Caves of Dunhuang in Gansu, Western China along the Silk Road. This is a scroll 210 cm in length and 24.4 cm wide showing the sky between declinations 40° south to 40° north in twelve panels, plus a thirteenth panel showing the northern circumpolar sky. A total of 1,345 stars are drawn, grouped into 257 asterisms. The date of this chart is uncertain, but is estimated as 705–10 AD. south polar projection for Chinese astronomer Su Song's (1020–1101) celestial globe. During the Song dynasty (960–1279), the Chinese astronomer Su Song wrote a book titled Xin Yixiang Fa Yao (New Design for the Armillary Clock) containing five maps of 1,464 stars. This has been dated to 1092. In 1193, the astronomer Huang Shang prepared a planisphere along with explanatory text. It was engraved in stone in 1247, and this chart still exists in the Wen Miao temple in Suzhou. In Muslim astronomy, the first star chart to be drawn accurately was most likely the illustrations produced by the Persian astronomer Abd al-Rahman al- Sufi in his 964 work titled Book of Fixed Stars. This book was an update of parts VII.5 and VIII.1 of the 2nd century Almagest star catalogue by Ptolemy. The work of al-Sufi contained illustrations of the constellations and portrayed the brighter stars as dots. The original book did not survive, but a copy from about 1009 is preserved at the Oxford University. Perhaps the oldest European star map was a parchment manuscript titled De Composicione Spere Solide. It was most likely produced in Vienna, Austria in 1440 and consisted of a two-part map depicting the constellations of the northern celestial hemisphere and the ecliptic. This may have served as a prototype for the oldest European printed star chart, a 1515 set of woodcut portraits produced by Albrecht Dürer in Nuremberg, Germany. =Early modern= Hevelius – Firmamentum Sobiescianum sive Uranographia 1690 During the European Age of Discovery, expeditions to the southern hemisphere began to result in the addition of new constellations. These most likely came from the records of two Dutch sailors, Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman, who in 1595 traveled together to the Dutch East Indies. Their compilations resulted in the 1601 globe of Jodocus Hondius, who added 12 new southern constellations. Several other such maps were produced, including Johann Bayer's Uranometria in 1603. The latter was the first atlas to chart both celestial hemispheres and it introduced the Bayer designations for identifying the brightest stars using the Greek alphabet. The Uranometria contained 48 maps of Ptolemaic constellations, a plate of the southern constellations and two plates showing the entire northern and southern hemispheres in stereographic polar projection. The Pole Johannes Hevelius finished his Firmamentum Sobiescianum star atlas in 1690. It contained 56 large, double page star maps and improved the accuracy in the position of the southern stars. He introduced 11 more constellations (Scutum, Lacerta, Canes Venatici, etc.).

A member of the Democratic Party, she was the fourth African-American woman in Congress and the first to represent the Midwest. Collins was elected to Congress in the June 5, 1973 special election to replace her husband, George, who had died in the December 8, 1972 United Airlines Flight 553 plane crash a month after being elected to a second term. The seat had been renumbered and combined from the 6th district to the 7th, and had been redrawn to include the Loop. She had previously worked as an accountant in various state government positions.  Congressional career  Throughout her political career, she was a champion for women's health and welfare issues. In 1975, she was instrumental in prompting the Social Security Administration to revise Medicare regulations to cover the cost of post- mastectomy breast prosthesis, which before then had been considered cosmetic. In 1979, she was elected as president of the Congressional Black Caucus, a position she used to become an occasional critic of President Jimmy Carter. She later became the caucus vice chairman. In the 1980s, Collins warded off two primary challenges from Alderman Danny K. Davis, who would finally be elected to replace her in 1996. In 1990, Collins, along with 15 other African- American women and men, formed the African-American Women for Reproductive Freedom. In 1991, Collins was named chair of the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Commerce, Consumer Protection, and Competitiveness. Her legislative interests were focused on establishing universal health insurance, providing for gender equity in college sports, and reforming federal child care facilities. Collins gained a brief national prominence in 1993 as the chairwoman of a congressional committee investigating college sports and as a critic of the NCAA. During her last term (1995–1997), she served as ranking member of the Government Reform and Oversight Committee. She also engaged in an intense debate with Rep. Henry Hyde over Medicaid funding of abortion that year.  Retirement, death and honors  Collins did not seek re-election in 1996, citing her age and the Republican majority in the House. In 2004, she was selected by Nielsen Media Research to head a task force examining the representation of African Americans in TV rating samples. Collins lived in Alexandria, Virginia at the time of her death on February 3, 2013, at the age of 81. The United States Postal Service's Cardiss Collins Processing and Distribution Center, located at 433 W.

Stock attended Washington State University (then College) where he was initiated into Phi Kappa Tau fraternity. He played college baseball for the Cougars from 1954 to 1955. He signed with the Orioles in 1956, and spent 1957–1958 performing military service. His initial trial with Baltimore, in April 1959, came after only one season of minor league baseball, in the Class C Northern League. Over all or parts of nine MLB seasons, Stock won 27 of 40 decisions (a winning percentage of .675), with 365 strikeouts and 22 saves in 517⅓ innings pitched. He allowed 434 hits and 215 bases on balls. Although a weak hitter in his major league career, posting only a .051 batting average (3-for-59), he was better than average defensively. He recorded a .980 fielding percentage with only three errors in 148 total chances, which was 25 points higher than the league average during his career. After his final appearance on the mound, Stock became a pitching coach for the Athletics in both Kansas City (from July 13, 1967, through the end of that season) and Oakland (1973–1976; 1984–1986), Milwaukee Brewers (1970–1972), and Seattle Mariners (1977–1981).

James Cecil Hatlo (September 1, 1897 – December 1, 1963), better known as Jimmy Hatlo, was an American cartoonist who in 1929 created the long-running comic strip and gag panel They'll Do It Every Time, which he wrote and drew until his death in 1963. Hatlo's other strip, Little Iodine, was adapted into a feature-length movie in 1946. In an opinion piece for the July 22, 2013, edition of The Wall Street Journal, \\"A Tip of the Hat to Social Media's Granddad\\", veteran journalist Bob Greene characterized Hatlo's daily cartoons, which credited readers who contributed the ideas, as a forerunner of Facebook and Twitter. Greene wrote: \\"Hatlo's genius was to realize, before there was any such thing as an Internet or Facebook or Twitter, that people in every corner of the country were brimming with seemingly small observations about mundane yet captivating matters, yet lacked a way to tell anyone outside their own circles of friends about it. Hatlo also understood that just about everyone, on some slightly-below-the-surface level, yearned to be celebrated from coast to coast, if only for a day.\\"  Biography  Hatlo was born in East Providence, Rhode Island, on September 1, 1897. His father, James M. Hatlow, a printer, was an immigrant from the Orkney Islands of Scotland. The original spelling of the family name became an inconvenience when, as a budding sports cartoonist, Hatlo fashioned a trademark signature with the \\"H\\" drawn as stylized goal posts and the \\"o\\" as a descending football. He shrank the \\"w\\" into a small apostrophe in the signature but otherwise dropped it entirely. = Early years = When he was a small child, the family moved to Los Angeles. As a young man, Hatlo began doing incidental artwork and engravings for local newspapers during an era when halftone reproduction of photographs was still limited. =World War I= When the United States entered World War I, Hatlo went to Kelly Field, hoping to become an aviator despite his poor eyesight. Instead he became a Spanish flu casualty and missed the war entirely. He relocated to San Francisco following the war and worked for both the San Francisco Call & Post and the San Francisco Evening Bulletin. The two papers later merged as the San Francisco Call- Bulletin, part of William Randolph Hearst's publishing empire. Hatlo at first drew \\"travelogues\\" for automobile advertising. These illustrated maps promoted auto travel (and thus auto sales). On the strength of his talent, he soon managed to work his way into editorial cartooning and then sports cartooning. His sports cartoon for the Call-Bulletin was Swineskin Gulch.Jimmy Hatlo: Man of Many Hats, Hogan's Alley, 2010 =Tip of the Hatlo hat= His break came when a shipment of panels from syndicated cartoonist Tad Dorgan failed to arrive in the mail. Hatlo was pressed into service to create something to fill the space. What resulted was They'll Do It Every Time, an instant hit with San Francisco readers. After several days, he began to run short on ideas. Various people—including Pat Frayne, Hatlo's managing editor at the time, and Scoop Gleason, his sports editor—later claimed credit for what happened next; even so, it may have been Hatlo himself, to adopt the tactic of asking readers to submit their own ideas for the cartoons. Whatever the source, this gambit was a huge success. Hatlo picked the best submissions, and credited each contributor by name, in closing the such cartoon with a box that read, \\"Thanx and a tip of the Hatlo Hat to...\\", followed by the submitters’s name. =The Hatlo Inferno= Jimmy Hatlo caricatured himself in this self-portrait. They'll Do It Every Time became a fixture in the Call-Bulletin. It soon caught the attention of Hearst and was picked up by Hearst's King Features Syndicate. His supplemental panel, The Hatlo Inferno, which depicted life in Hell, ran in tandem with They'll Do It Every Time for five years (1953–58). =Books= Hatlo's first They'll Do It Every Time collection, a 100-page softbound book, was published in 1939 by David McKay Company of Philadelphia. It was followed in the 1940s by two McKay hardcover collections. Avon paperback collections of They'll Do It Every Time followed throughout the 1950s. In his foreword to the 1943 McKay collection, Damon Runyon wrote that years earlier he had unsuccessfully tried to persuade the New York American to lure Hatlo away from San Francisco, adding: :It is my opinion, that Hatlo is today one of the greatest cartoonists the newspaper business has ever produced. Certainly he is one of the most human, and humanness is the element that makes a great cartoonist... Hatlo's forte is mirroring every day people. He has marvelous insight into the minds and souls of folks we all know. He has a great ear for the common speech of the day. He knows our men and women as they are in their homes, in the street and under all conditions, the result of mingling with them and rubbing elbows with them. Hatlo pictures people as they are, not as they ought to be, or as he imagines them... I have known the work of all the great cartoonists of the past 30 odd years in the newspaper business—I have known many of them personally, though that is not germane to an appraisal of their work, and I believe that Jimmy Hatlo rightly belongs in the first rank with them. I believe, too, that his cartoons represent a contribution to the entertainment of the American people at this time that is unsurpassed in any field.Runyon, Damon, introduction. They'll Do It Every Time. David McKay, 1943. =Popularity= Hatlo's success also attracted imitators, and a rival syndicate (McClure Newspaper Syndicate) launched a clone cartoon by Harry Shorten and Al Fagaly titled There Oughta Be a Law!.Markstein, Don. \\"THERE OUGHTA BE A LAW!,\\" Toonpedia. Accessed Oct. 22, 2018. After World War II, Hatlo settled in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, where he became part of a cartoonist community that included such artists as Gus Arriola, Frank O'Neal, Eldon Dedini and Hank Ketcham. At their peak, Hatlo's cartoons appeared in over 400 newspapers worldwide. Little Iodine, a spin-off comic strip featuring a mischievous little girl who had become one of Hatlo's stock characters, even got her own series of comic books and a 1946 movie adaptation. Hatlo's popularity was at its highest in the early 1950s. He was profiled in a 1952 feature article in The Saturday Evening Post titled \\"He Needles the Human Race.\\" Jimmy Hatlo endorsement print ad (1954)  Personal life and death  Hatlo was a lifelong smoker, who once appeared in magazine and newspaper ads for Lucky Strike cigarettes, his favorite brand. He was troubled in his later years by atherosclerosis. In late November 1963, Hatlo was hospitalized for a kidney condition. He died of a stroke early on December 1, 1963, at the age of 66. Awards and cultural references Hatlo was recognized for his work with the National Cartoonists Society's Newspaper Panel Cartoon Award for 1957 and 1959. The Banshees gave Hatlo their Silver Lady Award. The Canadian cartoonist Seth reminisced about Hatlo's work in his graphic novella It's a Good Life, If You Don't Weaken. The 2016 centennial of Carmel-by-the-Sea celebrated Hatlo as one of the noted cartoonists who were part of the town's history. Hatlo had moved with his wife and young son from Carmel to neighboring Pebble Beach in 1953, taking with him the name he had given to his house on Monte Verde Street—\\"Wit's End\\"—and transferring it to his new home on the 17 Mile Drive. The Monte Verde Street home was subsequently bought by Tom McCrea, brother of actor Joel McCrea, and converted into a small hotel, the Tally Ho Inn.

Diego Fabbri (July 2, 1911 - August 14, 1980) was an Italian playwright whose plays centered on religious (Catholic) themes. Early career Fabbri graduated from the University of Bologna in 1936 with a degree in economics and business. But his writing career had begun well before that. His first play, The Flowers of Pain, was published in 1928. He followed it with The Node, which was banned by the fascist government. In 1938, he collaborated with Guido Chiesa to write the play Absent. In 1939 Fabbri received an invitation to Rome, to become director of the Publisher Avenue. Then, in 1940, he was appointed secretary of the Catholic Film Center. He held the post until 1959. During this time, Fabbri began work on The Literary Fair. His co-director on this project was the poet Vincenzo Cardarelli. The project could not be completed until 1966, and Vincenzo Cardarelli did not live to see it. Fabbri was particularly prolific in 1940. In that year, he wrote three plays: “Marshes”, “Meadow”, and “Fun”. The following year he came out with “Orbits”, which was staged at the Teatro Quirino in Rome. “Marshes” was staged in the same theater in 1942. Films One of Fabbri's best known works is Inquisition, which was written in 1946. His career as a screenwriter and scriptwriter began with collaborations with directors as Vittorio De Sica, Alessandro Blasetti, and Germs. He also worked with other film makers such as Roberto Rossellini, Federico Fellini, Paw, Michelangelo Antonioni, René Clair, Luis Buñuel and Fleischer. In 1951 his The Seducer was represented. Fabbri wrote the screenplay for films like the Family Process (1953), The Liar (1954), Trial of Jesus (1955), Vigil of Arms (1956), Delirium (1957), Sons of Art (1959), Process Karamazov (1960), The Squirrel (1961), At the Table Do Not Talk About Love (1962), The Confidant (1964) and The Event (1967). Fabbri was head of the Roman Theatre La Cometa from 1960 to 1962. In 1968 he became President of ETI (Italian Theatre). His term there was marked by a policy of expansion and inculcating a theater culture throughout the country. Fabbri commitment to creating a national theater is reflected in the declaration of the manifesto for a theater of the people, which he signed in 1943, along with other prominent literati such as Pandolfi and Pinelli. Fabbri was one of the founders of the National Union of Drama Writers in 1945. A 1964 photo showing Fabbri and Luigi Silori. Fabbri was born in Forlì, where a theatre is named after him.

He is best remembered as the 1920 vice-presidential candidate of the Socialist Party of America, when he ran for office on a ticket headed by Eugene V. Debs. Biography =Early years= Seymour Stedman was born in Hartford, Connecticut, on July 4, 1871, the son of ethnic Anglo-Saxon parents with ancestors dating back to the time of the American Revolution.Alexander Trachtenberg (gen. ed.), A Political Guide for the Workers, 1920. Chicago: Socialist Party of the United States, 1920; p. 15. Financial difficulties forced the Stedman family to move west, settling in Solomon, Kansas, where adverse weather conditions forced the family still further towards poverty. Young Seymour was forced to drop out of school in the third grade to take a job tending sheep for $5 a month as a way of helping his family make ends meet. The Stedman family moved to Chicago in 1881 and Seymour took a job for a manufacturing company, working as a uniformed messenger boy. Stedman later took a job as a janitor for another Chicago firm, an occupation that allowed him ample time for reading. During the course of his reading, he became interested in political ideas for the first time and frequently debated the problems of the world with friends. As a byproduct of his reading and discussions, Stedman became an adherent of the Single Tax system advocated by Henry George, a reform program then in popular vogue. In 1889 Stedman decided that he wanted to be a lawyer. He approached the dean of the Northwestern University School of Law and told him of his desires, admitting that he had had only three years of formal education. After grilling the youth for an hour to determine Stedman's level of reading capability and intelligence, the dean relented and admitted Stedman to the university. Stedman continued to work as a janitor during the day and attended university lectures in the evening.Trachtenberg, p. 16. He was ultimately admitted to the Illinois State Bar Association in 1891. =Political career= SDP National Executive Committee, c. 1900 In 1890 the precocious Stedman decided that he wanted to become a public orator on behalf of the Democratic Party. He honed his skill speaking before the public, specializing in matters dealing with tariff legislation. His development as an aspiring Democratic politician came to an end in 1894, however, when the great strike of the American Railway Union headed by Eugene V. Debs, centered in Chicago and which Stedman supported as an official public speaker of the union, was crushed by judicial injunction and federal troops sent into Illinois by President Grover Cleveland. Stedman left the ranks of the Democratic Party in protest over this heavy-handed action of the Democratic president. In the aftermath of the defeated strike, Gene Debs was incarcerated for six months at Woodstock Jail in Chicago, where he was turned to the doctrine of socialism by the jailhouse visits of Milwaukee newspaper editor Victor L. Berger. Stedman would not be far behind the union leader, following a brief stint in the People's Party as a radical populist. He was an early booster of Debs for President of the United States, helping to establish the \\"Central E.V. Debs Club\\" in Chicago on May 20, 1896, and being elected president of the new booster organization by the gathering.\\"Central Debs Club is Organized\\", Chicago Tribune, May 21, 1896, p. 7. Stedman was elected to the 1896 National Convention of the People's Party, held in St. Louis, where he attempted to start a movement among the delegates to draft Gene Debs as the nominee of the organization for President of the United States.Trachtenberg, pp. 16–17. Nearly one-third of the 1300 assembled delegates signed a petition calling for Debs that Stedman circulated.Trachtenberg, p. 17. His effort was short-circuited by a trick of the supporters of William Jennings Bryan, however, when the gas lights were shut out on the convention. The following day a statement by Debs was read to the convention indicating that he had no desire to run for president and the bid was over, leaving Stedman to support Bryan in the 1896 campaign. In 1897 Victor Berger decided to work at converting the Social Democracy of America, an organization established with the goal of constructing a socialist colony in some western American state into a full-fledged socialist political party. He gathered together Debs, Stedman, and others for this cause, which came to a climax at the heated June 1898 convention of the organization. The battle over the main question of colonization versus independent political action was won by the colonization faction by a vote of 53 to 37,Trachtenberg, p. 18. a result that caused Berger, Debs, Stedman, and their co-thinkers to bolt the convention and establish a new political organization of their own — the Social Democratic Party of America (SDP). Stedman was a member of the governing National Executive Committee of the SDP from 1898. When after much acrimonious debate that organization merged with a similarly-named Eastern organization headed by Henry Slobodin and Morris Hillquit to form the Socialist Party of America (SPA) in 1901, Stedman became a founding member of that organization as well. Stedman's name was offered for nomination for Vice President of the United States at the SPA's 1908 Convention in Chicago, but he trailed Benjamin Hanford for the honor, losing by a vote of 106 to 46. Boston Socialist George Roewer and Stedman leaving Atlanta Federal Penitentiary, where they visited presidential nominee Gene Debs, May 1920. In 1915 Stedman was their candidate for Mayor of Chicago and in 1920 for Vice President of the United States, running on a ticket headed by Eugene V. Debs. During World War I Stedman was a prominent defender of war opponents indicted for sedition, most notably Rose Pastor Stokes. During the popular front period of the late 1930s, Stedman was briefly a member of the Communist Party of America. =Death= Seymour Stedman died on July 9, 1948, in Chicago, Illinois.

History  = Pre- debut = The group was originally part of a larger 15-member group Club Heart including the future lead singer of Super Monkey's, Namie Amuro. Their name was changed to Super Monkey's before their debut which was on September 16, 1992. In a magazine interview, Amuro revealed that the Super Monkey's were supposed to debut as a co-ed group with 5 female members and two male members. The concept was changed and the Super Monkey's made their debut as a five- piece all-girl group with members Namie Amuro, Anna Makino, Hisako Arakaki, Nanako Takushi, and Minako Ameku. = Super Monkey's (1992–93) = The Super Monkey's officially debuted on September 16, 1992, with the double a-side single, \\"Koi no Cute Beat / Mister U.S.A.\\" on the Toshiba EMI label. The group was promoted as a teen idol group with an American pop music sensibility. Their debut single was a moderate hit debuting within the top 30 of the Oricon charts. Makino, who was considered their leader, left the group in December that year. She was replaced with Rino Nakasone. She was announced as a new member to the group in magazine promotions and was scheduled to perform publicly with the group at the Sapporo Snow Festival in 1992 but couldn't due to an appendicitis. She left the group without recording any material. She was not replaced following her departure. = Super Monkey's 4 (1993) = The group released their second single, \\"Dancing Junk\\" in May 1993 under a new name, Super Monkey's 4. It was not as successful as their first release. Following the release of the single, the group took part in an ensemble singing unit, PJG, for NHK music show, Pop Jam, with several other teen idols. A third single, \\"Aishite Masukatto\\" was released in November that year and peaked in the top 70. The group's former leader Anna Makino, comeback shortly from the group, making an appearance from the Lotte Muscat Chewing Gum commercial. = Namie Amuro with Super Monkey's (1994–95) = As Amuro began to gain notoriety from acting and modeling gigs, the group name was changed again to Namie Amuro with Super Monkey's. The group became regulars of the karaoke television program, Yoru mo Hippare in April 1994. They released their fourth single, \\"Paradise Train\\" in July 1994. The single was the group's worst performing single failing to reach the top 100. The single has no official ranking as Oricon only monitored the top 100 releases at the time. Hisako Arakaki left the group shortly after the release of the single and was replaced by two new members. Reina Miyauchi and Ritsuko Matsuda joined the group in late 1994 and made their official debut with the group on January 25, 1995, with the release of their fifth single, \\"Try Me ~Watashi o Shinjite~.\\" The song, a Japanese language cover of Lolita's \\"Try Me\\", was a major hit peaking within the top 10 and selling over 700,000 copies. It was the first of three singles produced by Max Matsuura. After the success of the single, Matsuura suggested that Amuro become a solo act while the other members of the Super Monkey's formed a new girl group. In April, the single \\"Taiyou no Season\\" was released and accredited solely to Amuro although the background vocals were performed by the other members of Super Monkey's. Those other members, Nanako, Minako, Reina, and Ritsuko formed the group MAX, named after Matsuura, and signed to fledgling dance label, Avex Trax. They released their debut single, \\"Koi Suru Velfarre Dance ~Saturday night~\\" in May. Super Monkey's released their final single together, \\"Stop the Music\\" in July. As MAX, they released their debut album, Dance Tracks Vol.1 in October. Days following the release of their debut album, Amuro released her first single under the helm of producer, Tetsuya Komuro, \\"Body Feels Exit\\". = Post- disbandment = Following the disbandment of the group, lead vocalist, Namie Amuro, began a solo career joining former band members MAX on record label, Avex Trax. Paired with producer Tetsuya Komuro, Amuro went on to become one of the most successful Japanese musical acts in history. Her status as a fashion icon was solidified after the emergence of the Amura boom made her a cultural phenomenon. Following the success of her breakthrough album, Sweet 19 Blues (1996), the Super Monkey's former label, Toshiba EMI, released a greatest hits compilation, Original Tracks Vol.1 (1996). MAX continued to release their own material after the official disbandment of the Super Monkey's. However, they continued to perform with Amuro under the Super Monkey's name for her first two singles with Avex, \\"Body Feels Exit\\" and \\"Chase the Chance\\". MAX retired the Super Monkey's name and completely parted ways with Amuro after her 1996 show at Chiba Marine Stadium. MAX eventually came into their own success that same year with the release of their third single, \\"Tora Tora Tora\\". The group would go on to surpass the success of the Super Monkey's selling several million albums and attaining a number one single with \\"Give me a Shake\\" released in 1997. Both Amuro and MAX have continued to be active recording artist over a decade following the groups' break up. Original member, Anna Makino returned to Okinawa Actors School following her departure from the group. She became chief dance instructor at the school before leaving her position in 2002 to open another dance school for children diagnosed with down syndrome called Love Junx. Hisako Arakaki who left the group in 1994, also returned to Okinawa to become an instructor at the school. She would join and become the leader of B.B. Waves, the school's own dance unit that fostered the talents of future school graduates, Speed, Rina Chinen, Da Pump, D&D;, Yu Yamada and Meisa Kuroki. In 2006, Amuro, Makino, Arakaki and Ameku came together for an original Super Monkey's reunion piece in a pamphlet for Amuro's \\"Live Style 2006\\" tour. Takushi did not participate.

In 1999, he began publishing a series of articles about the Communist Party corruption in the Hong Kong magazine Frontline (), including a report on Bo Xilai. He was arrested in December 2000 and sentenced to eight years in prison on charges of revealing state secrets, but was granted early release in 2006. After a period of house arrest, he emigrated to Canada in 2009. Career in China Jiang is a graduate of the University of Liaoning, where he studied history. In the 1980s, he became a reporter for Xinhua News Agency. In 1984, he wrote his first story about official Bo Xilai, who was then a CCP official in a small town. In the early 1990s, Jiang became the Northeastern China bureau chief of the pro-Beijing Wen Wei Po newspaper in Hong Kong. In mid-1999, Jiang also published a series of eight reports in Front Line, a Hong Kong magazine, alleging corruption by various Chinese officials. Writing under the pen name \\"Wen Qingtian\\", Jiang stated that while mayor of Dalian, Bo Xilai had covered up corruption by his wife Gu Kailai, whose law firm had handled a number of government development and real estate deals. Another article, titled \\"Former Daqing Mayor Qian Dihua Arrested: Richest Man in the Area Who Kept 29 Mistresses\\", stated that a mayor had spent state money on cars and apartments for mistresses, while a third reported that Ma Xiangdong, deputy mayor of Shenyang, had lost US$3 million of state money while gambling in Macau. Ma was executed in 2001 for the loss.  Arrest and imprisonment  Despite having written under a pen name, Jiang was soon located by authorities. He was detained in December 2000 on charges of revealing \\"state secrets\\". According to Jiang, his lawyer was also arrested one day after agreeing to represent him. On September 5, 2001, he was found guilty in a secret trial, and sentenced to eight years' imprisonment. The sentence was later reduced to six years by the Liaoning Province Higher People's Court. The sentence drew protest from journalist advocacy organizations around the world. Reporters Without Borders described Jiang as \\"a courageous and exemplary journalist who did not think twice about the dangers he was running when he denounced corruption at the highest levels in the Communist Party of China\\". The administration of George W. Bush also protested Jiang's detention and called for his release. Jiang wrote later that he was tortured by police in an attempt to force a false confession; he stated that he lost consciousness several times and once required hospitalization. After a sympathetic guard agreed to deliver letters to Jiang's wife, who had them published in Asia Weekly, Jiang reported that his treatment improved. In 2003, Jiang was transferred to Wafangdian prison in Dalian, where he performed forced labour.  Post-imprisonment  On January 3, 2006, Jiang was released from prison and placed under unofficial house arrest. In 2009, he was allowed to emigrate to Canada. He settled in Toronto, serving as a Scholar at Risk at Massey College.

Awards Jiang was awarded a CPJ International Press Freedom Award in 2001 by the Committee to Protect Journalists, which recognizes reporters or publications who show courage in defending press freedom despite facing attacks, threats, or imprisonment. Initially unable to attend the ceremony due to his imprisonment, Jiang formally received his award in 2009.

Variant names are First Falls and Tyler's Mills. History A Committee to locate a mill at the first falls on the Quinnipiac River between Wallingford and Meriden was held in September, 1686. In 1704 the mill was sold to William Tyler, and the community became known as Tyler's Mills. The mill and surrounding lands were sold to Charles Yale around a hundred years later, and the name of the village became Yalesville. In 1695, Yalesville residents grew tired of having to take a canoe across the river, so a bridge was built adjacent to the residence of Roswell Yale, in what is now Yalesville. In about 1800, the current bridge over the Quinnipiac River was built. At the same time, the first school was constructed in Yalesville. The Yalesville Elementary School, now named Mary Fritz Elementary School, is the second one built on the site. Geography Yalesville is located in the northwestern portion of Wallingford.

From 1959–60 until the 2018–19 school year, Thomson was housed in the Lawrence Avenue East building constructed in 1958 and the new school building was built in the former Bendale Business and Technical Institute property in 2019. The school was named after David and Mary Thomson, the first European settlers that immigrated to Scarborough in the late 18th century. Its motto is Nil Sine Magno Labore (Nothing without great effort). History =Original school (1959-2019)= The original David and Mary Thomson C.I. building on 2740 Lawrence Avenue East, built in 1958.Coordinates: 43°45′12″N 79°15′34″W Wall plaque for the David and Mary Thomson C.I. dated 1957 The \\"1958\\" datestone on the original building. On July 14, 1953, the Scarborough Township Public School Board Area No. 2 (the forerunner of the Scarborough Board of Education and later the Toronto District School Board) acquired 8.6 acres of land on Lawrence Avenue East west of Brimley Road for the future secondary school known as David and Mary Thomson Collegiate Institute splitting off the population of Winston Churchill Collegiate Institute and R. H. King Collegiate Institute and expanded later to six acres.http://www.metropolicyarchive.ca/wp- content/uploads/2017/04/HSS-1146450-1958D_MSBT-Minutes-1958.pdf The property the STPSB No. 2 had acquired was the land donated by Scarborough's first European settlers from Scotland, David and Mary Thomson, whose descendants lived in Scarborough for generations. The school building was built in 1958 on the land farmed by the Thomson family and opened on September 8, 1959. The building was designed by the architects Peter L. Allward and George Roper Gouinlock and featured 23 standard classrooms, 1 art room, 2 music rooms, 5 science labs, library, 2 industrial arts, 2 home economics, 2 typing rooms, auditorium, double gymnasium, and cafeteria.http://www.metropolicyarchive.ca/wp- content/uploads/2017/04/HSS-1146450-1957D_MSBT-Minutes-1957.pdf It opened as the sixth secondary school in the borough. W. A. Porter Collegiate Institute, the fifth, had opened the year before. These two years marked the beginning of a rapid growth period in the Scarborough school system necessitated by equally rapid growth in business and industry and in population. The school underwent additions in the 1960s and 1970s including extra classrooms, new gymnasia for girls and boys, science labs, an enlarged library, and vocational shops. In 1989, following the loss of Tabor Park Vocational School to the Metropolitan Separate School Board, Thomson became as a third campus for Scarborough Centre for Alternative Studies; the latter moved to Centennial College in 1994. In June 2000, Midland Avenue Collegiate Institute was closed; students in its former catchment area are now served by Thomson. The capacity of the original facility is 1,623 pupils. As of the 2018-2019 year, the number enrolled is 997. Thomson C.I. celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2009 and 60th anniversary in 2019 to commemorate the closure of the original school building. =Move to Brockley Drive (2019-present)= A new \\"superschool\\" is to be built behind Bendale Business and Technical Institute, rendering the Thomson site surplus. The new Thomson C.i. building, under construction. On February 4, 2009, The Toronto District School Board approved a plan to merge David and Mary Thomson with the neighbouring Bendale Business and Technical Institute to form a modern \\"superschool\\". In June 2012 the Toronto Lands Corporation declared the Thomson site (12.3 acres) and building surplus. The land on which Thomson is located was donated by the family of David and Mary Thomson and there are no plans to protect and designate the site under the Ontario Heritage Act. Various boards and public bodies expressed an interest in buying the property, including the Toronto Catholic District School Board, Conseil Scolaire Viamonde and Conseil scolaire de district catholique Centre-Sud. In early 2013, Viamonde offered to purchase the property for future use as a high school, but then withdrew the offer because they had not received ministerial approval. Both the Thomson and the Bendale sites are now slated to be used for housing, but this proposal has aroused local opposition, particularly over the loss of green space and over residents' impressions that they were told the Thomson site would be used for a school and that they were initially promised an urban farm. Per regulation 444/98, other public agencies should be given the right to make an offer before the property is placed on the open market. Midland Park Community Association, a residents' group in Scarborough, and the Greater Bendale Advocacy Team (GBAT), formed by Mark Weiser, protested the TDSB's plans for townhouses on the Thomson site, resulting in a decision by Scarborough Community Council to place a hold on any further sale or development on either school site pending community consultation. The TDSB appealed to the Ontario Municipal Board. At a protest rally organised by GBAT in February 2015, more than 160 signs were distributed. In May 2015 the local councillor, Michael Thompson, announced that an agreement had been reached with the school district to reserve almost 3 acres of the site for community uses, including a daycare centre that is to be part of the new school; many felt this was insufficient. The city approved the purchase of 2 acres of the site under this plan. In April 2017, construction of the new school began on the racetrack and sports field of Bendale BTI. The new school, under its project name, Lawrence Midland Secondary School, is designed in conjunction with the architectural firms of ZAS Architects and Taylor+Smith. The new school was originally expected to be scheduled to open in September 2019 on Brockley Drive. Due to delays regarding construction issues ranging from weather to workers strike, the merged Thomson-Bendale student body operated from the existing Lawrence building until construction was completed. Thomson's new building officially opened on December 10, 2019 and features a four-storey modern building, cafetorium, two double gymnasiums and school-wide WiFi. As of August 2020, the former Lawrence building is undergoing demolition. Lockers in the 140s hallway in the original building. Logo Reginald H. King, head of the Scarborough Board of Education when Thomson opened, was a classicist. The motto Nil sine magno labore (Nothing without great effort) – which is also used by Brooklyn College in Brooklyn, New York – was selected as most appropriate from his collection of Latin mottos and was incorporated in the Thomson logo, which remains unchanged. The motto appears at the base of a scarlet maple leaf on which are superimposed a lamp of learning and the initials D and M in white. The leaf is flanked by a large \\"C\\" and \\"I\\", both in black forming arcs of a circle with the lower sections of the motto. Finally the name \\"Thomson\\", white on a scarlet background, surmounts the rest of the design and completes the circle. The school colours were originally scarlet, black and white. Campus David and Mary Thomson Collegiate Institute is a four-storey composite high school on 12 acres of land. The new school contains 48 conventional academic classrooms, seven science labs, five computer labs, two music rooms, one theatre arts room that can be used as a lecture hall, two gymnasia that can be partitioned into two smaller gyms, main and guidance offices, a library, a centralized cafetorium with a stage, six special education classes, four vocational shops and labs for woodworking, culinary, green industries and hairstyling and six staff workrooms. The school's new layout is radically different from the previous school as the facade in the front is mostly glass while the remainder were built with brown bricks. The first and second floors are art, technical, and science wings while the third and fourth are mostly an academic wing. The new lockers have a new design and are colored blue with a white trim. It has six staircases and 12 fire exits. In the old Lawrence building, the campus was built in a modern two-storey building consisted of 52 academic classrooms with department offices for English, Math, Social Sciences and Canadian/World Studies, nine science labs, two drafting rooms, two large gymnasia (one front and one back) that can be partitioned into four gyms with each training rooms in the upper area that no school has, two music rooms, a drama room, two art rooms, a sewing room, a home economics, 500-seat auditorium in the upper and lower sections with a stage, a cafeteria complex with servery, large atrium, two courtyards, a student council room, faculty lounge, a larger but expanded library, and six specialized shops (two wood shops, art, automotive with 3 bays, machine, and drafting). It also had yellow painted lockers and 9 staircases with fire exits. Academics and extracurricular activities Thomson has the following departments: Visual and Performing Arts; Business, Coop and Careers; English; History/Geography; Languages (including ESL and modern languages); Mathematics; Physical Education; Science; Social Studies; and Technological Studies. The school offers pre-AP and AP courses in seven subjects. David and Mary Thomson CI hosts the well-known SHSM programs: Health & Wellness SHSM, Information Communications Technology SHSM, & Horticulture and Landscaping SHSM. In addition to above, Thomson inherited a number of courses from Bendale including construction technology, baking and cooking and technological design. The school fields teams in many sports: archery, baseball and slo-pitch, badminton, basketball, cricket, cross country, curling, football, field and ice hockey, rugby, soccer, swimming, tennis, track and field, Ultimate Frisbee, volleyball, and wrestling. The school's team name was formerly known as the Thomson Redmen, which had a logo of a First Nations head although its football team was called Thomson Pioneers (1959-1962) for a short period. Since 2005, the school is now officially referred to as the Thomson Titans keeping the same colors but with a shield resembling the Tennessee Titans logo.https://www.thomsonforever.ca/evolution- of-thomsons-athletic-identity/ The tiger claws were incorporated in 2019 to symbolize the merger with Bendale.

Lichty created Grin and Bear it in 1932 and it ran 83 years until 2015, making it the 10th-longest-running comic strip in American history. Frequent subjects included computers, excessive capitalism and Soviet bureaucracy. Situations in his cartoons often took place in the offices of commissars, or the showrooms of \\"Belchfire\\" dealers with enormous cars in the background. His series \\"Is Party Line, Comrade!\\" skewered Soviet bureaucrats, always wearing a five-pointed star medal with the label \\"Hero\\". For his Sunday feature, George Lichty sometimes grouped four cartoons into a layout of two horizontal cartoons between a circular panel and a vertical panel. A similar approach was used by Fred Neher with the layout of gag cartoons on his Sunday Life’s Like That. Lichty's cartoon style had a strong influence on the cartoons drawn by Joe Teller, father of Teller (of Penn & Teller fame), as evidenced in Teller's book \\"When I'm Dead All This Will Be Yours!\\": Joe Teller—A Portrait by His Kid (2000).  Publication history  Launched in 1932, the strip was first distributed by Chicago Times Syndicate before moving to United Feature Syndicate, and then to the Field Newspaper Syndicate beginning in 1941. Field Enterprises was sold in 1984 to Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, which then in turn was sold in 1986 to King Features Syndicate, which distributed the feature until its last episode on May 3, 2015.\\"'Carpe Diem' comic debuts Sunday,\\" Press Connects (May 11, 2015). Lichty worked on the panel until 1974. Journalist Arthur Erenberg most likely wrote the gags from 1939–1974. After Lichty and Erenberg left the panel, cartoonists who worked on it included Fred Wagner, Rick Yager and Ralph Dunagin. It received the National Cartoonists Society's Newspaper Panel Cartoon Award for 1956, 1960, 1962 and 1964. At the end of its run, it was drawn \\"by Fred Wagner and written by Ralph Dunagin\\". The last Saturday episode ran on May 2, 2015, and the last Sunday on May 3. Books Lichty's cartoons were collected in three books, Grin and Bear It (McGraw-Hill, 1956), the paperback Grin and Bear It (Pocket Books, 1970) and Is Party Line, Comrade (Public Affairs Press, 1965).

Naval tactics and doctrine is the collective name for methods of engaging and defeating an enemy ship or fleet in battle at sea during naval warfare, the naval equivalent of military tactics on land. Naval tactics are distinct from naval strategy. Naval tactics are concerned with the movements a Commander makes in battle, typically in the presence of the enemy. Naval strategy concerns the overall strategy for achieving victory and the large movements by which a Commandant or Commander secures the advantage of fighting at a place convenient to himself. Modern naval tactics are based on tactical doctrines developed after World War II, following the obsolescence of the battleship and the development of long-range missiles. Since there has been no major naval conflict since World War II, apart from the Indo-Pakistani Naval War of 1971 and the Falklands War, many of these doctrines reflect scenarios developed for planning purposes. Critics argue that the collapse of the Soviet Union and the subsequent reduction in the size and capabilities of the Russian navy renders most such fleet-on-fleet scenarios obsolete. Key concepts A central concept in Western modern naval fleet warfare is battlespace: a zone around a naval force within which a commander is confident of detecting, tracking, engaging and destroying threats before they pose a danger. As in all forms of warfare, a critical objective is to detect the enemy while avoiding detection. The open sea provides the most favorable battlespace for a surface fleet. The presence of land Hughes WP, 2000, Fleet Tactics and Coastal Combat, 2nd Ed, Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, MA. and the topography of an area compress the battlespace, limit the opportunities to maneuver, make it easier for an enemy to predict the location of the fleet, and make the detection of enemy forces more difficult. In shallow waters, the detection of submarines and mines is especially problematic. One scenario that was the focus of American and NATO naval planning during the Cold War was a conflict between two modern and well equipped fleets on the high seas, the clash of the United States/NATO and the Soviet Union/Warsaw Pact. Because the Cold War ended without direct total war between the two sides, the outcome of such an action remains hypothetical, but was broadly understood to include, towards the late Cold War, multiple salvoes of anti-ship missiles against the Americans and U.S. attempts to air strike Soviet land bases and/or fleets. Given the eventual strategic surprise effectiveness of anti-ship missiles, the outcome of such a clash is far from being clear. The main consideration is for Carrier Battle Groups (CVBGs). Critics of current naval doctrine argue that although such a fleet battle is unlikely to occur in the foreseeable future, Cold War thinking continues to dominate naval practice.Wasted warships, by Lewis Page Prospect magazine, issue # 95, 20 February 2004 However, others point toward the increased naval budgets of Russia and South and East Asia as a possibility that conventional naval combat in the future may become relevant again. Naval tactics and weapons systems can be categorized by the type of opponents they are intended to fight. Anti-air warfare (AAW) involves action against aircraft and incoming missiles. Anti-surface warfare (ASuW) focuses on attacking and defending against surface warships. Anti-submarine warfare (ASW) deals with the detection and destruction of enemy submarines. The key threat in modern naval combat is the airborne cruise missile, which can be delivered from surface, subsurface or airborne platforms. With missile speeds ranging up to Mach 4, engagement time may be only seconds and such missiles can be designed to \\"skim the sea\\" mere metres above the sea surface. The key to successful defence was argued to be to destroy the launch platform before it fires, thus removing a number of missile threats at once. This is not always possible so the anti-aircraft warfare (AAW) resources need to be balanced between the outer and inner air battles. Missile tactics are now mostly fire and forget in the manner of the Harpoon or Exocet or utilize over-the-horizon targeting, such as the Tomahawk or Silkworm. Close-range missile defence in the modern age depends heavily on close-in weapon systems (CIWS) such as the Phalanx or Goalkeeper. Though traveling under water and at lower speeds, torpedoes present a similar threat. As is the case with missiles, torpedoes are self-propelled and can be launched from surface, subsurface, and air platforms. Modern versions of this weapon present a wide selection of homing technologies specially suited to their particular target. There are far fewer means of destroying incoming torpedoes compared to missiles. Submarines, as subsurface launching platforms, present an important threat to conventional naval operations. Anechoic coatings and ultra-quiet pump-jets provide modern submarines with the advantage of stealth. The move towards shallow water operations has greatly increased this advantage. Mere suspicion of a submarine threat can force a fleet to commit resources to removing it, as the consequences of an undetected enemy submarine can obviously be lethal. The threat posed by British submarines during the Falklands War of 1982 was one of the reasons why the Argentine Navy was limited in its operations. A single submarine at sea also impacted operations in the Indo-Pakistani Naval War of 1971. Conventional naval forces are also seen as providing a capability for power projection. In several naval operations, the aircraft carrier has been used to support land forces rather than to supply air control over the sea. Carriers were used in this way during the Gulf War.Grant, R.G.. Battle at Sea: 3000 Years of Naval Warfare. New York, NY: DK publishing, 2008. History Naval tactics have evolved over time with developments in naval technology and the evolution of warships. The evolution of naval tactics can best be understood by dividing naval history into thematic topics: * Galley tactics: Naval tactics from the earliest times to the Battle of Lepanto (1571), the last major battle in which (oar-propelled) galleys dominated. * Sailing ship tactics: Tactics focused on sailing warships, especially from the late 16th century, including the development of the line of battle. * Naval tactics in the Age of Steam: The development of the steam ironclad firing explosive shells lead to new tactics that were developed for the big-gun Dreadnought battleships. The mine, torpedo, submarine and aircraft posed new threats, each of which had to be countered, leading to tactical developments such as anti- submarine warfare and the use of dazzle camouflage. By the end of the steam age, aircraft carriers and submarines had replaced battleships as the principal units of the fleet. The modern period of naval tactics began with the widespread replacement of naval guns with missiles and long-range combat aircraft after World War II and is the basis for most of the tactical doctrine used today. =Post-World War II conflicts= The Indo-Pakistani Naval War of 1971 The Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 was the most significant conflict involving naval forces since World War II. Over two thousand sailors died, and multiple ships were sunk. Significantly, the first submarine sinking of a ship since World War II occurred when the Pakistani submarine PNS Hangor sank an Indian ASW frigate . Passive/active sonar, homing torpedoes, air strikes on naval facilities and fast missile craft were all utilized in this war. In the western theatre of the war, the Indian Navy successfully attacked Karachi's port in Operation Trident on the night of 4–5 December, using missile boats, sinking Pakistani destroyer and minesweeper ; PNS Shah Jahan was also badly damaged. In response, Pakistani submarines sought out major Indian warships.Seapower: A Guide for the Twenty-first Century By Geoffrey Till page 179 720 Pakistani sailors were killed or wounded, and Pakistan lost reserve fuel and many commercial ships, thus crippling the Pakistan Navy's further involvement in the conflict. Operation Trident was followed by Operation Python on the night of 8–9 December, in which Indian missile boats attacked the Karachi port, resulting in further destruction of reserve fuel tanks and the sinking of three Pakistani merchant ships. Since Pakistan's naval headquarters and almost its entire fleet operated from the port city of Karachi, this was a major strategic victory that enabled the Indian navy to attain complete naval superiority, and to partially blockade Pakistan. In the eastern theatre of the war, the Indian Eastern Naval Command completely isolated East Pakistan by a naval blockade in the Bay of Bengal, trapping the Eastern Pakistani Navy and eight foreign merchant ships in their ports. From 4 December onwards, the aircraft carrier was deployed, and its Sea Hawk fighter- bombers attacked many coastal towns in East Pakistan including Chittagong and Cox's Bazar. Pakistan countered the threat by sending the submarine , which sank en route under mysterious circumstances off Visakhapatnam's coast'Does the US want war with India?'. Rediff.com (31 December 2004). Retrieved on 14 April 2011. On 9 December, the Indian Navy suffered its biggest wartime loss when the Pakistani submarine sank the frigate in the Arabian Sea, resulting in a loss of 18 officers and 176 sailors. INS Vikrant launches an Alize aircraft The damage inflicted on the Pakistani Navy stood at 7 gunboats, 1 minesweeper, 1 submarine, 2 destroyers, 3 patrol crafts belonging to the coast guard, 18 cargo, supply and communication vessels, and large scale damage inflicted on the naval base and docks in the coastal town of Karachi. Three merchant navy ships – Anwar Baksh, Pasni and Madhumathi – and ten smaller vessels were captured. Around 1900 personnel were lost, while 1413 servicemen were captured by Indian forces in Dhaka. According to one Pakistan scholar, Tariq Ali, Pakistan lost half its navy in the war. The Falklands War The Falklands War of 1982 has been the next most significant conflict involving naval forces since World War II. The primary combat was between the Argentine Air force, based on the mainland, and the British naval force centered on aircraft carriers. Argentine naval forces played only a minor role in the conflict. The war demonstrated the importance of naval airborne early warning (AEW). Vital to British success was the protection of the two Royal Navy aircraft carriers, HMS Hermes and HMS Invincible. In 1982, the Royal Navy had effectively zero over-the-horizon radar capability, so to protect the British naval taskforce several destroyers and frigates were sent on radar picket duty to form the first line of defense against Argentine air attacks. As a result, the British lost the Type 42 destroyer HMS Sheffield to fire following an Argentine Exocet missile strike. Following the conflict, the Royal Navy modified some Westland Sea King helicopters for the AEW role. Other navies (including France, Spain and Italy) have since included AEW aircraft or helicopters on their carriers. The conflict also led to an increased interest in the close defense capabilities of naval ships, including Close-in weapon systems (CIWS) as a last-ditch defense against incoming missiles. The attack on the US frigate USS Stark on patrol in the Persian Gulf in 1987 also highlighted the danger of anti-ship missiles. In the case of Stark, the Iraqi Exocet missiles were not detected and Starks CIWS was not turned on as the ship was not expecting an attack. The Falklands war also saw the only time a warship has been sunk by a nuclear-powered submarine in a hostile attack, when the British nuclear-powered submarine HMS Conqueror attacked the Argentine cruiser ARA General Belgrano with torpedoes. With their nuclear propulsion plants, the submarines were able to remain on station virtually undetected. Other conflicts Another large naval operation conducted by a major power took place when the US Navy provided protection to Kuwaiti-owned tankers in the Persian Gulf between 1987 and 1988, during the Iran–Iraq War. Naval forces have played a supporting role in some land battles. US battleships provided gunfire support during the Vietnam War and the 1991 Gulf War. During the Falklands War, British destroyers and frigates carried out shellings on Argentine positions. The 1991 Croatian War and the subsequent War of Bosnia saw some naval action, initially when the Yugoslav Navy declared a blockade of the ports of Dalmatia from September to December 1991 and later in 1994-1995, when NATO naval forces, as part of Operation Sharp Guard, deployed a number of units to the Adriatic in order to enforce a United Nations arms embargo on former Yugoslavia. Later Operations on former Yugoslavia such as Deliberate Force and Allied Force involved the use of seaborne aircraft and the launch of Tomahawk cruise missiles against Serb targets. British and Australian warships provided gunfire support to the Al Faw operation during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. US and UK naval forces have used again Tomahawk cruise missiles against land targets in the course of actions undertaken since the end of the Cold War, such as the opening of international involvement in the Libyan Civil War, of which the British Armed Forces played a decisive role. The USS Cole bombing, a suicide waterborne mission on a US Aegis destroyer in Yemen in October 2000, has resulted in an increased awareness of terrorist risks whilst warships are in harbor or near potentially hostile coastlines. The War on Terrorism has also seen increased awareness of the naval role against terrorism. The US-led invasion of Afghanistan reaffirmed the role of naval air power, and US carrier based aircraft provided most of the sorties over Afghanistan against Taliban and Al-Qaeda forces. Over 90% of munitions delivered by the US Navy in Operation Enduring Freedom were precision-guided munitions. Several nations contributed vessels and maritime patrol aircraft to deny Al-Qaeda access to the Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean, including the US, Australia, Britain, Canada, Germany, Netherlands and New Zealand amongst others. France and Italy also used their carrier based aircraft over Afghanistan. Special forces operated from US and British carriers, in particular, the USS Kitty Hawk. Aircraft traditionally used for maritime patrol such as the Nimrod and P-3 Orion were also used in the overland surveillance role over Afghanistan as well as during the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

Naval strategy, and the related concept of maritime strategy, concerns the overall strategy for achieving victory at sea, including the planning and conduct of campaigns, the movement and disposition of naval forces by which a commander secures the advantage of fighting at a place convenient to himself, and the deception of the enemy. Naval tactics deal with the execution of plans and maneuvering of ships or fleets in battle. Principles The great aims of a fleet in war must be to keep the coast of its own country free from attack, to secure the freedom of its trade, and to destroy the enemy’s fleet or confine it to port. The first and second of these aims can be attained by the successful achievement of the third – the destruction or paralysis of the hostile fleet. A fleet that secures the freedom of its own communications from attack is said to have command of the sea. Naval strategy is fundamentally different from land-based military strategy. At sea there is no territory to occupy. Apart from the fisheries and, more recently, offshore oilfields, there are no economic assets that can be denied to the enemy and no resources that a fleet can exploit. While an army can live off the land, a fleet must rely on whatever supplies it carries with it or can be brought to it. Origins =Torrington and the fleet in being= The British Admiral the Earl of Torrington allegedly originated the expression fleet in being. Faced with a clearly superior French fleet in the summer of 1690 during the War of the Grand Alliance, Torrington proposed avoiding battle, except under very favourable conditions, until the arrival of reinforcements. By maintaining his fleet in being, he would prevent the French from gaining command of the sea, which would allow them to invade England. Although Torrington was forced to fight at the Battle of Beachy Head (June 1690), the French victory there gave Paris control of the English Channel for only a few weeks. =Introduction of the guerre de course= By the mid-1690s, privateers from French Atlantic ports, particularly St. Malo and Dunkirk, were a major threat to Anglo-Dutch commerce. The threat forced the English government to divert warships to the defence of trade, as convoy escorts and cruisers to hunt down the privateers. In France, the success of privateers against the Anglo-Dutch war effort stimulated a gradual shift from the employment of the Royal warships as battlefleets (guerre d’escadre) towards supporting the war on trade (guerre de course). The allied convoys presented large targets for commerce raiding squadrons. The most dramatic result of this shift was the Comte de Tourville’s attack upon the allies’ Smyrna convoy on 17 June 1693. The disadvantage of the guerre de course when pursued as a battlefleet strategy, rather than just by smaller vessels, is that it leaves a country’s own trade defenceless. Individual raiding squadrons are also vulnerable to defeat in detail if the enemy sends larger squadrons in pursuit, as happened to Leissegues at the Battle of San Domingo in 1806 and Von Spee at the Battle of the Falkland Islands in 1914. =Hawke, St Vincent and the close blockade= Until after the end of the 17th century it was thought impossible, or at least very rash, to keep the great ships out of port between September and May or June. Therefore, continuous watch on an enemy by blockading his ports was beyond the power of any navy. Therefore, too, as an enemy fleet might be at sea before it could be stopped, the movements of fleets were much subordinated to the need for providing convoy to the trade. It was not until the middle of the 18th century that the continuous blockade first carried out by Sir Edward Hawke in 1758–59, and then brought to perfection by Earl St Vincent and other British admirals between 1793 and 1815, became possible. Development It was only at the very end of the 19th century that theories of naval strategy were first codified, even though British statesmen and admirals had been practising it for centuries. =Mahan's influence= Captain, later Rear-Admiral, Alfred Thayer Mahan (1840–1914) was an American naval officer and historian. Influenced by Jomini's principles of strategy, he argued that in the coming wars, control of the sea would grant the power to control the trade and resources needed to wage war. Mahan's premise was that in the contests between France and Britain in the 18th century, domination of the sea through naval power was the deciding factor in the outcome, and therefore, that control of seaborne commerce was secondary to domination in war. In Mahan’s view, a country obtained \\"command of the sea\\" by concentrating its naval forces at the decisive point to destroy or master the enemy’s battle fleet; blockade of enemy ports and disruption of the enemy's maritime communications would follow. Mahan believed that the true objective in a naval war was always the enemy fleet. Mahan's writings were highly influential. His best-known books, The Influence of Sea Power upon History, 1660–1783, and The Influence of Sea Power upon the French Revolution and Empire, 1793–1812, were published in 1890 and 1892 respectively and his theories contributed to the naval arms race between 1898 and 1914. Theodore Roosevelt, himself an accomplished historian of the naval history of the War of 1812, closely followed Mahan's ideas. He incorporated them into American naval strategy when he served as assistant secretary of the Navy in 1897–1898. As president, 1901–1909, Roosevelt made building up a world-class fighting fleet of high priority, sending his \\"white fleet\\" around the globe in 1908-1909 to make sure all the naval powers understood the United States was now a major player. Building the Panama Canal was designed not just to open Pacific trade to East Coast cities, but also to enable the new Navy to move back and forth across the globe.Carl Cavanagh Hodge, \\"The Global Strategist: The Navy as the Nation’s Big Stick,\\" in Serge Ricard, ed., A Companion to Theodore Roosevelt (2011) pp. 257–73Stephen G. Rabe, \\"Theodore Roosevelt, the Panama Canal, and the Roosevelt Corollary: Sphere of Influence Diplomacy,\\" in Serge Ricard, ed., A Companion to Theodore Roosevelt (2011) pp. 274–92. =The Colomb brothers= In Britain, Captain John H. Colomb (1838–1909) in a series of articles and lectures argued that the navy was the most important component of imperial defence; his brother, Admiral Phillip Colomb (1831–1899), sought to establish from history general rules applicable to modern naval warfare in his Naval Warfare (1891). But their writings achieved nothing like the fame achieved by Mahan. =Corbett’s principles= Sir Julian Corbett (1854–1922) was a British naval historian who became a lecturer at the Royal Naval War College in Great Britain. Corbett differed from Mahan in placing much less emphasis on fleet battle. Corbett emphasized the interdependence of naval and land warfare and tended to concentrate on the importance of sea communications rather than battle. Battle at sea was not an end in itself; the primary objective of the fleet was to secure one’s own communications and disrupt those of the enemy, not necessarily to seek out and destroy the enemy’s fleet. To Corbett, command of the sea was a relative and not an absolute which could be categorized as general or local, temporary or permanent. Corbett defined the two fundamental methods of obtaining control of the lines of communication as the actual physical destruction or capture of enemy warships and merchants, and or a naval blockade. His most famous work, Some Principles of Maritime Strategy, remains a classic. Impact of the World Wars World War I and II left a major impact on naval strategies thanks to new technologies. With the creation of new naval vessels like the submarine, strategies like unrestricted warfare were able to be implemented and with the creation of oil based fuel, radar and radio navies were able to act more efficiently and effective since they were able to move faster, know where enemies were located and were able to communicate with ease. = Change of fuel from coal to oil = Before the start of the World War I, many naval warships ran on coal and manpower. This was very inefficient but the only way they could power these ships at the time. Half the crew on these ships were there to maintain the coal, but oil was seen more efficient to where the number of men needed to maintain it were nowhere near as many. With the newfound use of oil, the benefits were abundant for the warships. With the use of oil, ships were able to travel at 17 knots. This was drastically different compared to the 7 knots ships traveled before with the use of oil. Coal also took up more space in the ships. Oil can be stored in multiple tanks where they all circumvent to one place to be used unlike coal which was stored in the ship, in multiple rooms and had multiple boiler rooms. Oil was seen to be more efficient. = World War I = Leading up to World War I, there was a naval arms race in Europe. With this race introducing many innovations to navies across Europe, in 1906 the British unveiled a revolutionary new warship called HMS Dreadnought powered by steam turbine. This ship reached a speed of 21 knots, one of the fastest at the time; this warship also had advancements in weaponry that no other nation's navy had at the time. With this, the arms race changed to which nation could build the most of those newly made warships. With these new, heavily-armed ships the Allies had more opportunities for blockades in the various theaters of the war.  Warfare  The submarine, introduced in World War I, led to the development of new weapons and tactics. The Germans' fleet at the time was, in some people's opinion, the most advanced, and was constructed by Alfred Peter Friedrich von Tirpitz. The fleet consisted of the U-boat, and smaller class UB and UC boats.  Unrestricted Warfare in WW1  Unrestricted Warfare was first introduced in the first world war by the German navy. The strategy was to sink vessels without warning, the most famous incident being the sinking of the RMS Lusitania. The strategy was considered controversial and many navies (the U. S. especially) asked Germany to stop using said strategy. Germany stopped for a bit but resumed using the strategy to attack British freighters that carried food so they could starve the British. After the resuming of the strategy, many countries tried to limit the use of submarines altogether. The strategy was never abolished; rather, other navies started using it.  Technological impact in WW1  = Radio = Radio was first used by the navy in the first world war. During that time radio was still in the first stages of being used so it was hard to make out audio messages; instead, navies used Morse code to communicate messages between other naval ships and naval bases. By having this technology, naval bases were able to communicate when they gained intelligence without using a physical messenger. = World War 2 =  Submarine Warfare  = Unrestricted Warfare in WW2 = In World War 2 many different Navies started using the Unrestricted Warfare strategy. The first instance being in The Battle of the Atlantic which was fought between the Germans, Italians and Allies and the final instance being the Pacific War where the US targeted Japan.  Carrier-Based Warfare   Technological impact in WW2  = Radar = Going into the 2nd world war, militaries were exposed to this new technology called the Radar. The radar was used by Navies (especially the U.S. and U.K.) to detect planes and ships that were entering the nation’s coastal zone and detecting objects that passed by their naval vessels. The Navies were able to use radar to plan out strategies to know where enemy ships were before planning out attacks as well as knowing when enemies were coming to attack their vessels. = Radio = The radio was also a vital part in communicating messages in the 2nd world war like it did in the first but the major difference was more navies had access to the technology of the radio and that militaries used the radio to communicate how the war was going to the general public. Modern Increasingly naval strategy has been merged with general strategy involving land and air warfare. Naval strategy constantly evolves as improved technologies become available. During the Cold War, for example, the Soviet Navy shifted from a strategy of directly contending against NATO for control of the bluewater oceans to a concentrated defense of the Barents Sea and the Sea of Okhotsk bastions. In 2007, the U.S. Navy joined with the U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Coast Guard to adopt a new maritime strategy called A Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower that raised the notion of prevention of war to the same philosophical level as the conduct of war. The strategy was presented by the Chief of Naval Operations, the Commandant of the Marine Corps and Commandant of the Coast Guard at the International Seapower Symposium in Newport, R.I.. The strategy recognized the economic links of the global system and how any disruption due to regional crises – man-made or natural – can adversely impact the U.S. economy and quality of life. This new strategy charted a course for the three U.S. sea services to work collectively with each other and international partners to prevent these crises from occurring or reacting quickly should one occur to avoid negative impacts to the United States. Sometimes a military force is used as a preventative measure to avoid war, not cause it.

Eisenhower Memorial is a United States presidential memorial honoring Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Europe during World War II and the 34th President of the United States. Located to the south of the National Mall, the memorial is set in a park-like plaza, with large columns framing a mesh tapestry depicting the site of the Normandy landings, and sculptures and bas-reliefs arrayed in the park. Architect Frank Gehry designed the memorial and Sergey Eylanbekov sculpted the bronze statues of Eisenhower in various settings. The memorial's tapestry artist was Tomas Osinski, and the inscription artist, Nicholas Waite Benson. On October 25, 1999, the United States Congress created the Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial Commission, and charged it with creating \\"...an appropriate permanent memorial to Dwight D. Eisenhower...to perpetuate his memory and his contributions to the United States.\\" The preliminary design proved controversial. After several years of hearings and several design changes by Gehry, final design approvals were given in 2017, when dignitaries held a groundbreaking ceremony at the four-acre site in Washington DC. aThe dedication ceremony was initially scheduled for May 8, 2020, the 75th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day, but was postponed to September 17, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Authorizing a memorial and establishing a memorial commission U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower earlier commanded Allied forces in World War II. Three individuals were behind the successful effort to establish a memorial to President Dwight D. Eisenhower: Rocco Siciliano, Senator Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii), and Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska). Siciliano, a Roman Catholic, Italian American born in Utah, was called to active duty as a Private in 1943 while a ROTC student. Promoted quickly to first lieutenant in the United States Army, he was awarded a Bronze Star for valor for his actions as part of the 87th Mountain Infantry Regiment during the Italian Campaign. A graduate of Georgetown Law School, he worked for the National Labor Relations Board from 1948 to 1950, and was appointed by Eisenhower in 1953 to be the Assistant Secretary of Labor for employment and manpower activities. In 1957, Eisenhower made Siciliano his Special Assistant to the President for Personnel Management. In 1958, he engineered a meeting between Eisenhower and African American civil rights leaders Lester Granger, Martin Luther King, Jr., A. Philip Randolph, and Roy Wilkins. After decades of public service, Siciliano became head of the Eisenhower Institute in the 1990s. The 50th anniversary of the Normandy landings and the approach of the 50th anniversary of Eisenhower's election as president increased interest in the 34th President. In 1999, his last year as the institute's chairman, Siciliano decided to push for a memorial to Eisenhower. Siciliano had a link to Senator Stevens, a highly decorated World War II Army Air Forces pilot who had worked in the Department of the Interior during the Eisenhower administration and who had proved critical in winning statehood for Alaska. The Eisenhower Institute had also honored Stevens with its Eisenhower Leadership Prize in 1999. Siciliano broached the idea of a memorial with Stevens. Stevens suggested a bipartisan effort, and brought Senator Inouye into the effort. Inouye had served in Italy with the 442nd Infantry Combat Regiment, losing his right forearm in combat, and later being awarded the Medal of Honor. Siciliano worked with Stevens and Inouye to write the legislation that would authorize a memorial and establish a memorial commission. No bill was ever introduced in the 106th Congress, and there was almost no debate about the memorial effort. Legislative language authorizing the memorial was inserted into the Department of Defense Appropriations Act. Neither H.R. 2561 (the House version of the bill) nor S. 1122 (the Senate version) contained memorial language. But Senators Stevens and Inouye were both appointed to the conference committee to reconcile the House and Senate bills. The conferees inserted language (Section 8162) to authorize the memorial and establish the Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial Commission into the conference report. The House approved the appropriations act 372-to-55 on October 13, and the Senate followed by a vote of 87-to-11 on October 14. President Bill Clinton signed the bill into law (P.L. 106–79) on October 25, 1999. P.L. 106-79 appropriated $300,000 to fund the commission's initial activities. The law established a 12-member commission, four of whom were to be appointed by the President, four by the Senate (equally split between both political parties), and four by the House (equally split between both political parties). The law provided for a chair and vice chair (they could not be members of the same political party), the appointment of new members in case of vacancy, and a date for the initial meeting (nor more than 45 days after all appointments have been made). Members of the commission would receive no compensation. The commission had the power to spend money appropriated or donated to it, accept donations, hold hearings, and enter into contracts. It was required to make annual reports to the President and Congress, and make a report about the memorial plans as soon as possible. In 2008, Congress enhanced the commission's duties and powers. Section 332 of the Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-229; May 8, 2008) more clearly defined the commission's ability to solicit donations and contract for specialized services, and permitted it to do so outside of existing federal law. The commission was also empowered to seek the assistance of any federal agency (so long as it paid for that assistance), enter into cooperative agreements with the same, and to procure administrative and support services from the General Services Administration (GSA). A commission staff was also established. An executive director was required to be employed, and the commission was authorized to hire staff (including an architect, and no more than three senior staff) and accept volunteers. Commissioners (and staff and volunteers) were now reimbursed for their reasonable travel expenses. Most importantly, an unlimited amount of money was authorized (but not actually appropriated) to carry out the commission's duties and to design and construct the memorial. \\"Living\\" vs. inanimate memorial Susan Eisenhower advocated a \\"living memorial\\" rather than a monument. The basic theme of the Eisenhower memorial was outlined at the Eisenhower Memorial Commission's first meeting in June 2000. Senator Stevens said he wanted an \\"out-of-the-box\\" design, and Senator Inouye said the design should be so spectacular that the Eisenhower Memorial would surpass the Lincoln Memorial and Jefferson Memorial as the most-visited memorial in the nation's capital. According to Washingtonian magazine, commission chairman Siciliano early on raised the name of architect Frank Gehry as a potential designer. Siciliano was already friends with Gehry: They both lived in Santa Monica, California, and Siciliano's late wife had introduced them. Siciliano also sat on the board of directors of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, which in 1991 commissioned Gehry to design its Walt Disney Concert Hall. (The auditorium opened in 2003 to critical acclaim.) Several Eisenhower family members, however, expressed their desire for a \\"living memorial\\". Susan Eisenhower, former president and chairman emeritus of the Eisenhower Institute, was a particular advocate of the concept. The \\"living memorial\\" would not be a monument but rather a program or think tank or some other organization which would help to perpetuate the legacy and values of President Eisenhower. The Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars was raised as a potential model. Siciliano expressed his view that a \\"living memorial\\" would be far too costly to endow and operate, but Senators Stevens and Inouye thought the idea had merit. The Eisenhower Memorial Commission gave the Eisenhower Institute either a $200,000 contract or a $400,000 contract (sources differ as to the amount) to study the issue. While the Eisenhower Institute studied the issue, the Eisenhower Memorial Commission agreed to also study a physical monument, which meant developing a vision for the memorial and identifying potential sites in Washington, D.C. The outcome of the \\"living memorial\\" study is not clear. Washingtonian magazine reported that, at a memorial commission meeting in June 2007, Siciliano said the Eisenhower Institute concluded a \\"living memorial\\" would duplicate the work of the institute and other \\"legacy organizations\\" (private foundations and nonprofits dedicated to perpetuating the legacy and carrying on the work of President Eisenhower). The Eisenhower Memorial Commission's March 2013 budget report to Congress, however, says that the \\"legacy organizations\\" were unable to agree on what form the \\"living memorial\\" would take. Whatever the reasons, the Eisenhower Memorial Commission rejected a \\"living memorial\\". According to the memorial commission, Susan Eisenhower and representatives from other \\"legacy organizations\\" reached a consensus that the existing legacy groups already formed a \\"living memorial\\". Site selection Site of the proposed Eisenhower Memorial (red boundary) in Washington, D.C. In order to pursue a physical memorial, the Eisenhower Memorial Commission needed the authority to erect a memorial on public lands. Congress immediately gave it that permission in Section 8120 of the Department of Defense and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations for Recovery From and Response to Terrorist Attacks on the United States Act, 2002 (P.L. 107–117; December 20, 2001). The 2001 act gave the commission the right to erect a memorial on public lands under the jurisdiction of the United States Department of the Interior anywhere in the District of Columbia or its environs. The act also placed the memorial under the authority of the Commemorative Works Act (as then amended). This required the commission to work with the National Capital Memorial Advisory Commission in selecting a site, meet certain fundraising requirements, and meet certain deadlines. Twenty-six sites were reviewed by the Eisenhower Memorial Commission. The criteria for choosing a site included: * \\"Prominence, public access, and availability\\"; * \\"Thematic appropriateness to Eisenhower’s memory\\"; * \\"Feasibility of use and avoidance of undue controversy\\". Three sites were short-listed by the commission. The first was on the ground floor of the United States Institute of Peace building at 2301 Constitution Avenue NW. The structure's vast atrium, which looks out on Constitution Avenue, was discussed as early as June 2004. But according to an Eisenhower Memorial Commission report, a member of the Eisenhower family opposed co-locating the memorial there. The commission also considered Freedom Plaza on Pennsylvania Avenue NW and a site on Maryland Avenue SW. An Eisenhower family member requested in September 2004 that the commission also consider the Auditors Building at 14th Street SW and Independence Avenue SW. The commission hired M. Arthur Gensler Jr. & Associates, a design and architectural firm, to assist it in evaluating these three sites. A report on the sites was considered by the commission at its March 2005 meeting. Commissioner David Eisenhower successfully moved that the commission limit its focus to Freedom Plaza and the Maryland Avenue site. The Eisenhower Memorial Commission unanimously chose the unnamed plaza bounded by Maryland Avenue SW, 4th Street SW, and 6th Street SW as its preferred site. The plaza is separated from Independence Avenue SW and the National Air and Space Museum by Seaton Section Park, and is adjacent to the north side of the Lyndon Baines Johnson Department of Education Building. The plaza is surrounded by institutions connected to Eisenhower's legacy, including the Department of Education, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Voice of America, and the National Air and Space Museum. The location is also just three blocks from the United States Capitol. The commission requested that the site be named \\"Eisenhower Square\\" once the memorial was built. Selection of this site immediately caused controversy. Some urban planning advocates who wanted to restore Maryland Avenue SW to its original alignment through the square were angry because that the memorial would preclude it. Nonetheless, on November 8, 2005, the National Capital Memorial Advisory Commission approved the Eisenhower Memorial Commission's request that the Eisenhower Memorial be located on Maryland Avenue.; The choice of the Maryland Avenue site involved additional congressional action. The Commemorative Works Act barred the erection of any memorials within \\"Area 1\\", the National Mall and its immediate environs. Any memorial erected in Area 1 required the approval of Congress. Congress provided that approval in \\"Approving the location of the commemorative work in the District of Columbia honoring former President Dwight D. Eisenhower\\" (P.L. 109-220; May 5, 2006), which authorized construction of the memorial within Area 1. Design competition Frank Gehry in 2007, about the time he won the memorial design competition. The design process began in 2006. At a commission meeting to consider design principles in March 2006, Siciliano mentioned Gehry's name for a second time as a possible memorial designer. Susan Eisenhower, who was present as a member of the audience, asked if \\"the design vocabulary would be modern or traditional\\". A commission staff member said her question was \\"premature\\". Siciliano answered Eisenhower by saying the final memorial would be a \\"high-quality\\" one, and then mentioned again that Gehry was interested in designing the monument. The commission moved ahead with pre-planning for the design competition in 2007. It hired the architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill to create a document which would outline \\"what the National Eisenhower Memorial should be, including goals, requirements, constraints, and opportunities.\\" The following year, the commission issued a call for proposals via the General Services Administration's Design Excellence Program. After initially denying a FOIA request filed by the National Civic Art Society, the General Services Administration revealed that it solicited and received design entries from fewer than 50 firms. None of the firms were minority-owned firms, six firms were owned by women, and 11 firms were small businesses. After receiving more details from those on its selected \\"short list\\", the Eisenhower Memorial Commission selected the proposal submitted by Frank Gehry of Gehry Partners on March 31, 2009. According to Washingtonian magazine, Gehry was Commissioner David Eisenhower's second choice. Nonetheless, David Eisenhower was reportedly very pleased with Gehry's selection. In March 2009, David Eisenhower said he could \\"vouch for the integrity and excellence of the selection process.\\" The design competition has been strongly criticized. An early critic of the competition was Justin Shubow, head of the National Civic Art Society (NCAS). Shubow characterized the design process as rigged in Gehry's favor, and established a Web site, EisenhowerMemorial.net, to attack the Gehry design. Edward A. Feiner, former chief architect of GSA and the creator of the Design Excellence Program. also objected to the memorial competition for being a closed competition. Critics also included Paul D. Spreiregen, architect, professional advisor for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial competition, and former chairman of the American Institute of Architects' Committee on Competitions, who in 2011 called for a design competition open to the public. On February 29, 2012, Representative Darrell Issa, chair of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, launched an investigation into the competition. Although Issa's primary concern was the memorial's design, Issa requested that Eisenhower Memorial Commission chair Rocco Siciliano provide the committee with copies of all proposed designs submitted during the design competition, a detailed description of competition process, a detailed description of the means by which the commission selected the Gehry submission, and documentation on all votes taken by the commission regarding the design competition (broken down by member). Issa, in his capacity as an ex officio member of the National Capital Planning Commission, also directed the Eisenhower Memorial Commission to preserve all documentation related to the design competition and the Gehry design. Issa's investigation went no further than that in 2012. However, on March 20, 2012, the Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests and Public Lands of the House Natural Resources Committee held a hearing into the design competition. Subcommittee chairman Representative Rob Bishop (R-Utah) asked how much it would cost to run a second design competition, and the political affairs newspaper Roll Call said Bishop \\"tried to restart the design competition\\". Although the subcommittee selected mostly witnesses who were critical of the Gehry design, a few defended the design competition process as fair. William J. Guerin, assistant commissioner for the Office of Construction at GSA, said critics mischaracterized the call for proposals as a closed competition. Ned Cramer, editor of ARCHITECT: The Magazine of the American Institute of Architects, wrote nine days after the hearing that the design competition as a \\"limited request for qualifications\\" rather than a closed competition. Art and architectural critic Aaron Betsky decried the general tone of the hearing as \\"mindless innuendo and vituperative allegations\\", and Cramer agreed. Lydia DePillis of the Washington City Paper described the debate as a disorganized parade of criticism which was reaching \\"historic proportions\\". Design development Rep. Darrell Issa, chair of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, who strongly criticized the memorial design. On March 25, 2010, the Eisenhower Memorial Commission unanimously selected the preferred design concept created by Frank O. Gehry and the commission and design team completed its first round of meetings with federal review agencies. Maryland Avenue runs through the site with a vista that focuses on the U.S. Capitol Building. The setting for the four-acre memorial will be framed by giant welded steel tapestries supported by columns 80-feet tall by 10-feet wide. The largest tapestry will extend nearly the entire city-block length of the Department of Education Building. The tapestry will depict an aerial view of Normandy Beach at the present day. Elements of Eisenhower's home in Abilene, Kansas will be included, according to the commission. Gehry's initial tapestry design, which depicted the Kansas landscape, received unanimous concept approval from United States Commission of Fine Arts (CFA) on September 15, 2011, including affirmation that the scale and artistry are appropriate. The Department of Education originally questioned the tapestries. However, following revisions and meetings including the review of tapestry mock-ups, Secretary of Education Arne Duncan wrote that the U.S. Department of Education supported the current design of the memorial. The National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) also expressed support for the design but had not yet given preliminary approval. The Architect of the Capitol endorsed Gehry's design revision, and \\"applaud[ed] the decision, courage, and commitment of time\\" that the design team gave to the Section 106 Consultation Meeting process, noting that there are no negative impacts on the view and vista of the U.S. Capitol. The commission's preferred design concept approved in March 2010, which included Commissioner David Eisenhower's approval (Dwight Eisenhower's grandson), represents Eisenhower as president and general through large stone bas reliefs and text. Although final images and quotations are still under consideration, the leading alternative image representing the general is General Eisenhower with 101st Airborne troops prior to the D-Day invasion in June 1944. Memorials in Washington have historically been controversial. The design has been severely criticized by the president's son John Eisenhower and granddaughter Susan Eisenhower, who said her entire family opposes it. Robert Campbell, the Boston Globe's architecture critic, said about the design, \\"It’s way too big. It’s too cartoony. Someone should scrub the design and start over.\\" Roger L. Lewis, an architect and a professor emeritus at the University of Maryland, criticized and opposed the design in the Washington Post: \\"Building a quasi-fenced precinct makes no sense. The narrative theme relating to Eisenhower’s boyhood, so visually dominant in the present design, also makes no sense. Gehry instead could craft a less grandiose yet visually powerful memorial composition...\\" Columnist Richard Cohen wrote that the Memorial does not accurately capture Eisenhower's life. George F. Will also opposed the design in the Washington Post. The design has been criticized in The New Republic, National Review, Foreign Policy, Metropolis Magazine, The American Spectator, and The Washington Examiner. While some have expressed criticism, others have voiced support for the design. Philip Kennicott, the Washington Post culture critic, praised the design: \\"Gehry has produced a design that inverts several of the sacred hierarchies of the classical memorial, emphasizing ideas of domesticity and interiority rather than masculine power and external display. He has 're- gendered' the vocabulary of memorialization, giving it new life and vitality.\\" Former member of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, Witold Rybczynski, whose critique of the memorial appeared in The New York Times, praised the concept of the roofless building and defended the size of the tapestries: \\"Mr. Gehry and his collaborators have developed hand-weaving techniques so that the screens really do resemble tapestries. Having seen full-size mock-ups of the screens on the site, I am convinced that their size will not be out of scale with the surroundings.\\" David Childs, former chair of both the National Capital Planning Commission and U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, wrote to Congress in support of the design. Landscape architects Laurie Olin and William Pedersen have called the design a worthy tribute to a great national leader that is \\"in sympathy with the character of Washington, D.C.\\" The Washington Post editorial board also endorsed the project, noting that \\"Mr. Gehry's proposal promises to be a wonderful addition to the face of the Mall, a vision Washington is lucky to have. Moving forward, Congress should authorize these plans as quickly as possible so the memorial can proceed on schedule. As entertaining as these squabbles have often been, enough is enough already.\\" Television producer Norman Lear expressed praise for Frank Gehry, citing Gehry's original concept of tracing the journey of a young man from Kansas to the pinnacles of success as a warrior and the leader of a great nation as \\"the very best way to illustrate President Eisenhower's significant achievements...\\" Pulitzer Prize-winning architectural critic, Paul Goldberger, lauded Frank Gehry in a Vanity Fair article for earnestly attempting to commemorate Eisenhower. =Further developments= In December 2011, David Eisenhower resigned from the Eisenhower Memorial Commission. As the family's representative, Commissioner Eisenhower voted three times in favor of the preferred design concept, including most recently at the July 2011 Commission meeting. In January 2012, the National Civic Art Society published The Gehry 'Towers' Over Eisenhower: The National Civic Art Society Report on the Eisenhower Memorial, written by Justin Shubow, the organization's president. Quoted in a front-page New York Times story, the report is a book-length critique of the memorial's competition, design, and agency approval. The Washington Post said the report received \\"a remarkable amount of attention, offering talking points for conservative columnists and critics.\\" Writing in Better! Cities & Towns, Philip Langdon called the report \\"scathing\\" and said it included \\"devastating pieces of information.\\" In May 2012, in response to public and congressional criticism Gehry proposed additional modifications to the memorial and the Eisenhower Commission published new mock-ups by his firm on its website. Members of the Commission of Fine Arts in 2013, who initially approved the memorial's concept, then later issued strong critiques of the design. On July 18, 2013, the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts approved the general concept of the memorial in a 3-1 vote. In August 2013, President Barack Obama appointed Bruce Cole to the Eisenhower Memorial Commission. Cole had previously criticized Gehry's design in articles and congressional testimony. Cole serves on the board of advisors for the National Civic Art Society. On September 8, 2013, the Eisenhower Memorial Commission cancelled its appearance before National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) meeting scheduled for September 12. The Eisenhower Commission explained, \\"We have decided to forego appearing before NCPC on Sept. 12 in the belief that the next few months would be better spent satisfying the concerns addressed in the [NCPC's Executive Director's Recommendation].\\" According to the Washington Post, the NCPC recommendation \\"calls the testing of the memorial materials insufficient, takes issue with the scale and placement of the columns and tapestries, and raises questions about whether the design fulfills its aim to be an 'urban park.'\\" The Continuing Resolution approved by Congress on October 16, 2013, zeroed all construction funding and prohibited starting construction. It also required that all funding necessary to complete construction be in place before construction begins. On November 21, 2013, the memorial again went before the Commission of Fine Arts, where commissioners critiqued the design, which did not receive approval. Commissioner Alex Krieger, Professor in Practice of Urban Design at Harvard Graduate School of Design, said the design would fail as a \\"traditional first-semester architecture exercise.\\" Also in November, a \\"weary\\" Gehry told the Financial Times, “I don’t know whether [the memorial] will get built.” The New York Times reported that \\"The project's fate is uncertain.\\" Congress's fiscal year 2014 omnibus bill appropriated only $1 million to the project instead of the requested $51 million, which halved the Eisenhower Commission's annual operating budget. The bill effectively blocked construction until the next round of appropriations. According to Roll Call the bill \\"zeroes out federal funding for construction and asks for a progress report on private fundraising efforts.\\" On April 3, 2014, the National Capital Planning Commission voted 7-to-3 to deny preliminary approval of the memorial. The NCPC said it was supportive of a memorial, but rejected the current design because it failed to preserve the vista along Maryland Avenue SW, failed to preserve the view of the U.S. Capitol building, did not meet the L'Enfant Plan requirements for preserving open space, and did not \\"[respect] the building lines of the surrounding rights-of-way\\". At the request of Representative Darrell Issa, chair of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, the NCPC asked the Eisenhower Memorial Commission to report back to it every two months on its memorial redesign. =Design approval= In early September 2014, Gehry submitted another revised design to the Eisenhower Memorial Commission. This design eliminated the east and west tapestries, moved the columns back from Independence Avenue, and made other, smaller changes to the memorial. The following week, Representative Darrell Issa sent a letter to the commission, asking it to consider a memorial design that completely eliminated the tapestries and columns. Gehry threatened to remove his name from the project if the stripped-down version of the design Issa requested was approved and sent to the NCPC. The Eisenhower Memorial Commission met on September 17, 2014, to consider Gehry's design changes. But the commission lacked a quorum to conduct business, as only five members attended (all four presidentially- appointed members, and Rep. Sanford Bishop). In a private vote conducted via email on September 23, the Eisenhower Memorial Commission approved Gehry's revised design. A motion to delay consideration of the design for several weeks was defeated. The commission forwarded only one design (Gehry's preferred revision) to the NCPC for its consideration, rather than the two alternatives requested by Representative Issa. On October 2, 2014, the NCPC voted 10-to-1 in to approve Gehry's revised preliminary design. The NCPC- approved design now headed back to the CFA. On October 16, the CFA approved the revised preliminary design. This approval allowed the memorial's designers to begin working on the specifics of the memorial, such as the statuary, the specific quotations to be used, the fonts for these quotations, landscaping, paving, and more. CFA and NCPC approval were needed for all design-specific elements. =Detailed design approvals= Eisenhower Memorial architect Craig Webb met with the Commission of Fine Arts on February 19, 2015, to seek approval of the memorial's lighting design, but the CFA decline to approve his proposal and asked him to return with a more concrete plan (one which included details on the actual ground lights to be used, and the location and height of lighting poles). Webb delivered a presentation on the quotations to be used on the memorial, but CFA members questioned whether the plan to use extracted and combined quotations would create the impression of \\"authentic text\\" where none existed. Webb discussed landscaping and signage with the CFA in March 2015. The CFA was positive about the landscaping design, although it suggested some changes and ask for additional study. It was more critical of the signage, and asked for alterations. Webb discussed sculptural elements with the commission in April, and generally praised the improvements. A review of design concepts for the tapestries, columns, and overlook wall occurred in May 2015, and strongly approved of these. As is often the case, the CFA asked for full-scale mock-ups (both day and night) for these elements. On May 8, 2015, the National Park Service issued a final draft of it Determination of Effect, a legally required assessment of the project's negative impact on nearby historic properties. The document affirmed that any impact would be minimal. Prominent local architect Arthur Cotton Moore challenged this finding in a May 22 letter to the District of Columbia's State Historic Preservation Officer, arguing that the memorial would significantly alter the L'Enfant Plan. NPS Facility Division Chief Sean Kennealy replied to issues raised by Moore and others on June 4, concluding that Maryland Avenue SW would be enhanced by the elimination of parking lots and the memorial's alignment of tree plantings. The Commission of Fine Arts gave its unanimous final approval to the memorial's detailed plans on June 17, 2015. The approval meant that the memorial now needed the authorization of the National Capital Planning Commission, which scheduled a vote on for its final approval for July 9. On July 9, 2015, the National Capital Planning Commission voted 9-to-1 to approve the final design submissions for the Eisenhower memorial.; (At least one authoritative industry publication noted that the project was now a joint venture between Gehry Partners and AECOM, which provides technical and management support services.) Although the NCPC was worried about the durability of the tapestry material and welds, the memorial commission's submission assuaged these concerns. =Additional design changes= With the Eisenhower family still unhappy with the memorial design, Congressional funding for the memorial appeared uncertain. James Baker, former U.S. Secretary of State and a member of the Eisenhower Memorial Commission advisory commission, met with members of the family and the design team and brokered a compromise. On September 14, 2016, Susan Eisenhower issued a letter in which she said Gehry Partners had agreed to include images of the D-Day landing sites (as they exist today) on the metal tapestry. A new quote (\\"The proudest thing I can claim is that I am from Abilene\\") would be added to the quotes carved into the blocks of stone. With these changes, the Eisenhower family agreed to support the memorial. Additional design changes were made in early December 2016. The metal tapestry was changed to remove all images of Abilene, and now only featured the present-day Normandy coast at Pointe du Hoc. The statue of Eisenhower as a boy was relocated from its central location to a promenade located between the metal tapestry and the Department of Education building, and some text from Eisenhower's June 22, 1945, \\"Homecoming Speech\\" will be etched on a nearby wall. The architects felt this would better emphasize Eisenhower's attempts to create a Department of Education and in expanding the federal role in funding primary, secondary, and higher education. Four trees near the center of the memorial were also removed to improve views of the tapestry. The revisions needed to be approved by the NCPC and CFA. At its meeting on January 23, 2017, the CFA approved of the tapestry change, but did not support moving the boyhood statue behind the tapestry nor the removal of the four trees. The agency asked for the architects to revisit and resubmit the design for final approval, and asked that a full-size, on- site mock-up of the Normandy tapestry be provided for commissioners' viewing to ensure the tapestry's legibility. In October 2017, the NCPC approved design changes to the tapestry showing the site of the Normandy landings centered on Pointe du Hoc, and placement of the boyhood statute, with related text. E-memorial In August 2012, the Eisenhower Memorial Commission announced plans for an \\"e-memorial\\" to accompany the physical one. Eisenhower Memorial Commission officials claimed the Eisenhower Memorial would be the first presidential memorial to be augmented with an e-memorial. The e-memorial will be a free mobile app designed by Local Projects, a media design firm which has worked with museums and historic sites to develop similar projects. Seven key episodes in Eisenhower's life—including his entry at United States Military Academy in 1911, D-Day in 1944, Eisenhower's election to the presidency in 1952, the racial desegregation crisis of 1957, and the creation of NASA in 1958—will be augmented with still images, video, and audio to both provide greater insight into how these events were not only important to Eisenhower but also helped change national and world affairs. Some visual components will be superimposed onto the physical memorial, to provide interactivity between the physical and virtual worlds. The app will also include educational games for children. Some of the materials used by the app will be provided by the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library and Museum. Development costs for the app were anticipated to be $2 million, and the National Park Service would be responsible for maintaining and upgrading the e-memorial once the Eisenhower Memorial was dedicated. A memorial Web site, distinct from the National Capital Parks-Central Web site, was also planned. The e-memorial drew criticism from Susan Eisenhower in August 2012, who argued that \\"storytelling\\" was better left to museums rather than the monuments. In June 2013, Susan Eisenhower said it was \\"surprising, even inappropriate\\" that the Eisenhower Memorial Commission was moving ahead with the e-memorial. She argued that there were \\"many issues still to be resolved\\" about the memorial's physical design, and she felt the memorial commission should be focused on design issues \\"rather than selecting inscriptions and making announcements about the E Memorial.\\" On June 6, 2013, The Eisenhower Memorial Commission premiered the first of six videos which it said would be part of the e-memorial. The new video focused on D-Day. The film, which put the viewer in the role of Eisenhower as he made critical decisions regarding the Normandy landings, used rarely-seen D-Day footage. The General Services Administration issued a \\"sources-sought notice\\" asking scholars and educators to submit their names and availability to help design elementary and secondary school lesson plans for used on the memorial's Web site. Funding As with most previous presidential memorials, the activities of the Eisenhower Memorial Commission and the design and construction of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial were initially intended to be fully funded by the federal government. The Eisenhower Memorial Commission assured the Eisenhower family that no private fundraising for the memorial would be needed. This was an important issue for the Eisenhowers, who have established or sit on the board of directors of six \\"legacy organizations\\". The family was concerned that fundraising for the memorial would negatively affect their ability to fundraise for these legacy organizations. In 2008, however, House Appropriations Committee staff informed the Eisenhower Memorial Commission that Congress was no longer likely to completely fund the design and construction of the memorial due to the economic downturn caused by the Great Recession, and that some private fundraising would be required. The commission consulted with the fundraising consulting firm Odell, Simms & Lynch (OSL) in February 2011 to develop a fundraising strategy. Representatives of the Eisenhower family met with OSL in March 2012, during which time the Eisenhowers expressed their concern with the fundraising campaign. OSL, however, argued that the legacy organizations would benefit from the successful completion of the memorial. OSL crafted a fundraising plan for the commission, and outreach to 200 major donors (defined as those individuals of high net worth) began in 2013. The commission targeted \\"individuals with a direct link to President Eisenhower and his legacy; organizations and individuals with an interest in the E-Memorial educational component; and friends and admirers of Frank Gehry and his work\\" in \\"key markets\\" such as California, Georgia, Kansas, New York, Texas, and Washington, D.C. Working with retired Marine Corps General Paul X. Kelley and former Republican National Committee chairman Frank Fahrenkopf, both members of the Eisenhower Memorial Commission's Advisory Board, OSL also reached out to members of the Giving Back Fund, all of whom are capable of donating more than $10 million. As of March 2013, the Eisenhower Memorial Commission had already raised $1.7 million in donations and pledges. Once the memorial design was approved, the commission said it was ready to move forward on fundraising outreach to corporations, foundations, and international organizations and foreign governments. Congress has appropriated some funds for the memorial's design and construction, however. Congress appropriated $16 million in the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2010 (P.L. 111-88; October 29, 2009), and $30.99 million in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 (P.L. 112-74; December 17, 2011). The 2011 legislation was also important because it allowed the Eisenhower Memorial Commission to meet a critical fundraising challenge. The Commemorative Works Act (CWA; as amended) requires a memorial foundation to raise 75 percent of the construction costs before the United States Department of the Interior is permitted to issue a construction permit. Additionally, the CWA requires a memorial foundation to raise an additional amount, equal to 10 percent of the memorial's total construction costs, for deposit in a memorial maintenance trust fund (which is administered by the National Park Service). The 2011 legislation declared that the funds provided by Congress thus far shall be deemed to be sufficient to meet both fundraising requirements of the CWA. By March 2013, the Eisenhower Memorial Commission had spent $8.721 million of the $46.99 million in existing design and construction funds. However, in October 2013 Congress suspended the commission's exception to the full funding requirement of the Commemorative Works Act (CWA) until it had the necessary funds, essentially preventing the commission from building a memorial (even if approved by the Commission of Fine Arts or the National Capital Planning Commission). The cost of constructing the memorial was estimated to be $65 million to $75 million in October 2014. The memorial commission said it had $22 million in appropriated funds to left to begin construction, which the commission said it would use for site preparation (estimated to cost $22 million). However, the Commemorative Works Act requires that the commission have at least 75 percent of construction funds in hand before work could begin. Although the legislation authorizing the memorial originally waived the CWA's requirements, the 2014 legislation barring the commission from expending its remaining funds also withdrew that waiver. The Eisenhower Memorial Commission said it would ask Congress to restore the waiver so that construction could begin immediately. =Additional funding= On December 16, 2014, President Barack Obama signed Public Law 113–235 (128 Stat. 2443), which set aside $1 million (available until expended) for salaries and expenses of commission members, and the cost of construction design. But all other funding for the memorial was zeroed out, and Congress eliminated the 2011 CWA funding waiver. But despite the preliminary design approval, Anne and Susan Eisenhower spent the first several months of 2015 lobbying Congress for changes in the memorial. The Eisenhower Memorial Commission asked Congress for a significant budget expenditure in fiscal 2016. In addition to a $2 million operating budget (for salaries and expenses), the commission requested $68.2 million to begin construction. However, the draft appropriations bill approved by the House Appropriations Committee in June 2015 contained no funding for the memorial, required the commission to limit its operations to \\"essential\\" daily functions only, and ordered the commission to comply with the CWA fundraising requirements before construction could begin. A nonbinding clause in the bill asked the Eisenhower Memorial Commission to consider restarting the design process. \\"However, the Commission's ongoing indifference to the views of the Eisenhower family, and the resulting lack of consensus on the memorial design, remain an area of significant concern,\\" the bill read. \\"It is inconceivable and unacceptable to the Committee that a memorial to Dwight D. Eisenhower could be designed, approved, and built without the active support of the Eisenhower family.\\" The full House Appropriations Committee approved the draft on June 16. The draft Senate version of the bill funded commission operations at $1 million in fiscal 2016. The Senate bill contained nonbinding language, advising the memorial commission that \\"Construction should not commence until there is broad support among the public, the Eisenhower family and Congress.\\" By June 2015, the memorial's cost had risen to an estimated $142 million to $150 million. This was the cost still cited in December 2016. On July 13, 2015, the government of Taiwan announced a $1 million donation to the memorial. The Eisenhower family announced their support the memorial in September 2016. Fundraising had netted about $8 million as of December 1, 2016. In May 2017, a fiscal 2017 spending bill was enacted into law which gave the memorial commission $45 million ($ in dollars) in construction funds. The memorial commission announced it had received a total of $25 million to build the memorial. Major donations (in the $1 million to $5 million range) had been received from FedEx, Honeywell, Pfizer, and an anonymous donor. Commission officials said that if Congress authorized another $41 million in 2018, the commission would have enough money to build the memorial (a total of $111 million). Eisenhower Memorial Commission members Rocco Siciliano was the first chairman of the Eisenhower Memorial Commission. The Eisenhower Memorial Commission consists of 12 appointed commissioners. Four members are appointed by the President of the United States. They are: * Rocco C.

He was the first (and so far only) ethnic minority chief constable in the United Kingdom and the first black officer of chief constable-equivalent rank. Fuller took up his role as Chief Constable of Kent on 5 January 2004. He joined the Metropolitan Police in 1975 as a cadet aged 16 and served in uniformed and CID positions throughout London. His service has included several postings at New Scotland Yard, including selection for Special Branch. Whilst a detective chief inspector stationed at Shepherds Bush and Hammersmith, he devised an innovative burglary control programme which successfully reduced burglary. This was a forerunner to the London - wide Operation Bumblebee. As DCI at Paddington he devised innovative covert techniques to successfully reduce street robbery under the Operation Eagle Eye initiative. As a detective superintendent he worked as a specialist staff officer seconded to Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary based at the Home Office. He gave specialist advice on crime and terrorism issues and carried out inspections of police force Special Branches in relation to counter-terrorism. He also gave regular advice to the Chief HMI, Ministers and the Home Secretary. In 1998, he helped set up the Racial and Violent Crime Task Force in response to criticism of the Metropolitan Police arising from the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry. He subsequently served as a uniformed superintendent in Lambeth and was the chief superintendent in charge of Battersea, where he was successful in reducing street crime. In January 2000, as a commander, he took command of West Area Serious Crime Group. As well as overseeing murder investigations, he set up Operation Trident to tackle gun crime within black communities in London. In 2001, he won the G2 ‘Man of the Year Award’ in recognition of his personal achievements and contribution to policing in London. In February 2002, he was promoted to deputy assistant commissioner. As well as heading the Metropolitan Police Drugs Directorate, he was also the Director of Intelligence, as part of a newly formed Specialist Crime Directorate. On 16 February 2010, it was announced that Fuller would be leaving Kent Police to start his new role as Chief Inspector of the Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate. He retired from the Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate in 2015 at the end of his 5-year appointment. He has written a book about his experiences in policing entitled Kill the Black One First, published in February 2019.

He was drafted by the Kansas City Chiefs in the fifth round of the 2005 NFL Draft. He played college football at Illinois State. Grigsby was also a member of the Miami Dolphins and Houston Texans. Early years Grigsby attended and played high school football at Canton High School where he was an all-area linebacker during his senior season. He was not recruited to play college football until an Illinois State coach saw him lifting weights in his high school's weight room. College career Grigsby was a four-year letterman at Illinois State University. As a sophomore, he set a school record with 179 tackles and also recorded what would remain a career-high four sacks. The following season, Grigsby tied his own school record with 179 tackles. He came in second behind only future Kansas City Chiefs teammate Jared Allen in the voting for the Buck Buchanan Award, given annually to the top defensive player in Division I-AA. In 44 games (40 starts), at Illinois State, Grigsby recorded a school record 580 tackles to go along with 41.5 tackles for a loss, 13 sacks, six fumble recoveries, five forced fumbles and seven passes defended. He was Gateway Football Conference Player of the Year, a Division I-AA All-American and Buchanan award finalist each of his final three seasons. Professional career =Kansas City Chiefs= Grigsby was drafted by the Kansas City Chiefs in the fifth round (138th overall) of the 2005 NFL Draft. On July 15, he signed a three-year, $1.067 million contract with the team. It included a signing bonus of $142,000 and base salaries of $230,000 (2005), $310,000 (2006) and $385,000 (2007). In his rookie season with the Chiefs, Grigsby chose to wear No. 51. He played in all 16 regular season games that year in a reserve role and finished third on the team with 19 special teams tackles. Appearing in 15 games in 2006, Grigsby again ranked third on the Chiefs in special teams tackles with 18. He missed one game that season with foot injury. Prior to the 2007 regular season, Grigsby was converted from linebacker to fullback. The transition was chronicled on the HBO reality series Hard Knocks:Training Camp with the Kansas City Chiefs. Despite the position change and an injury to his ribs during the preseason, Grigsby made the team. He went on to appear in 13 games for the Chiefs that season including one start. His first NFL reception came on a nine-yard pass from quarterback Brodie Croyle against the Denver Broncos on December 9, and he finished the season with two receptions for 14 yards. He finished third on the team in special teams tackles (12) for the third straight season. A restricted free agent in the 2008 offseason, Grigsby was not tendered a contract by the Chiefs and became an unrestricted free agent. =Miami Dolphins= On March 4, 2008, Grigsby agreed to terms on a one-year contract with the Miami Dolphins. The signing reunited him with current Dolphins running backs coach James Saxon, who was Grigsby's position coach with the Chiefs in 2007. Grigsby won the team's starting fullback job in 2008 after incumbent Reagan Mauia was released during final cuts. However, after starting the Dolphins' season opener against the New York Jets on September 7, Grigsby was released by the team two days later in favor of free agent Casey Cramer. He spent the rest of the season out of football. =Houston Texans= Grigsby was signed by the Houston Texans on May 12, 2009. He was waived/injured on August 18 and subsequently reverted to injured reserve. He was released with an injury settlement on August 25. =Absence from football= Grigsby worked as a color commentator for Illinois State University's television coverage for the football team. Grigsby now works in medical device sales and lives in Las Vegas with his wife and three children.

George Rife Clark (August 22, 1902 - May 25, 1981) was an American cartoonist best known for his syndicated cartoon panels The Neighbors and Side Glances. For both, Clark employed a loose, naturalistic drawing style to illustrate minor human foibles and familiar family situations. In the mid-1930s, George Jean Nathan's The American Spectator commented, \\"Clark, creator of Side Glances, deserves unqualified recognition for a penetrating picture of our middle class.\\" Born in the Oklahoma territory when it was not yet a state, Clark went to grammar school in Bridgeport, Oklahoma and spent a few years in Bentonville, Arkansas before attending high school in Oklahoma City, followed by study at the Chicago Art Institute. He began his professional cartoon career with work in The Daily Oklahoman and the Oklahoma News, moving on to the Cleveland Press. Competing against 72 artists, he won the $500 first prize for Community Fund drive with a poster selected for use in 42 American cities. Soon he was doing animation drawings for The Gumps and illustrating for Collier's, Judge, McCall's and Country Gentleman.Sandusky Register, February 11, 1934. He joined the art staff at Newspaper Enterprise Association, where he drew human interest sketches. His Side Glances cartoon became popular when it was syndicated by NEA Service in 1929. During its early years, NEA promoted the panel by highlighting its human interest appeal: \\"It has been said before of George Clark that 'he combines splendid art ability with the characteristics of a trained reporter.' It is hard to improve on that appraisal. Certainly these intimate little views of humanity he calls Side Glances are a happy blend of keen observation and understanding and of genuine art. They have humor and pathos; often a tear lurks just behind the smile--which, after all, is the way of life.\\" In 1939, William Galbraith Crawford (who always signed simply \\"Galbraith\\") took over Side Glances when Clark switched to the Chicago Tribune-New York Daily News Syndicate to launch The Neighbors. It was almost identical to Side Glances, continuing to offer essentially the same sort of middle-class family humor. He soon added a Sunday strip, Our Neighbors, the Ripples, a title eventually shortened to The Ripples. The Sunday strip was dropped in 1948, but his daily panel continued until 1971. Stephen Becker (Comic Art in America) commented, \\"He has never attempted to induce the belly laugh; he feels that a gently humorous reminder of something that has probably happened to his reader will suffice.\\"Becker, Stephen. Comic Art in America, Simon & Schuster, 1959.Lambiek: \\"George Clark\\" Awards and exhibitions He received the National Cartoonists Society's Newspaper Panel Cartoon Award in 1961. At the NCS site, a computer glitch or clerical error has mistakenly positioned a biography billboard for another artist named Clark in George Clark's niche. In 1972, Clark's work was included in the Brooklyn Museum's \\"A Century of American Illustration\\" exhibition. Clark died May 25, 1981, and was buried in Saint Charles Cemetery on Long Island, New York.

It reached number 3 on The New York Times children's best sellers list in January 2006. Three manga volumes have been released: Coronation Volume 1: The Merlin Prophecy, Coronation Volume 2: Homecoming, and Coronation Volume 3: Hunter's Moon. Plot Ellie Harrison has just moved to Annapolis, Maryland. Her new school, Avalon High, seems like a typical high school with the stereotypical students: Lance the jock, Jennifer the cheerleader, Marco, the bad boy/desperado, and Will, the senior class president, quarterback, the student every girl wants and all around good guy. But not everyone at Avalon High is who they appear to be, not even Ellie herself. Characters Elaine \\"Ellie\\" Harrison: the new student at Avalon High—she moved to Annapolis, Maryland from Minnesota and is presumed to represent Elaine of Astolat for most of the novel, though it is revealed later that she plays a different role in the legend, The Lady of the Lake, Arthur's magical protector. Arthur William \\"Will\\" Wagner Jr.: has a slightly disruptive family relationship at home and is a star quarterback for the Avalon High School Fighting Knights, he represents King Arthur, as most people thought. Jennifer Gold: a cheerleader and Will's girlfriend who corresponds to Queen Guinevere in the legend of Arthur. Lance Reynolds: the Avalon High School football team's cornerback, who is Will's best friend. He goes behind Will's back to cheat with Jennifer. Lance corresponds to Sir Lancelot. Marco Campbell: Marco is Will's step- brother/half brother. He represent Mordred. Mr. Morton: Avalon High School English teacher. He is a member of \\"The Order of the Bear\\" and represents Merlin. Admiral Arthur William Wagner Sr.: He is Will's father and he corresponds to Uther Pendragon in the legend. He seemingly murders his best friend (by sending him into combat where he was killed) and then marries his wife. Jean Wagner: Jean is Admiral Wagner's wife, who married him 6 months after her husband died in combat. Although originally it was believed that she was merely Will's stepmother, it was later revealed (by Mr. Morton) that she was in actuality Will's birth mother. She corresponds to Igraine in the legend. Ellie's Parents: professors of medieval history on sabbatical. Her mother is writing a book on Elaine, the so-called \\"lily maid\\" of Astolat, and her father is writing his on the sword that Ellie takes to the park and hands to Will during his face-off with Marco, thus revealing herself as the Lady of the Lake. Ellie's parents care about her despite being an embarrassment at times. Miscellaneous The book has twenty-nine chapters and each chapter starts with a quote, which relatively relates to the content of the chapter, from Alfred Lord Tennyson's famous poem about Elaine the Lady of Shalott. There is a subtle foreshadowing in the book's first chapter that points to Ellie being the Lady of the Lake, as opposed to the Lady of Shalott. Her home state, Minnesota, is known as \\"the Land of 10,000 Lakes\\". Adaptation Disney Channel adapted the book as a Disney Channel Original Movie of the same name in 2010. The movie stars Britt Robertson, Gregg Sulkin, Joey Pollari, Devon Graye and Steve Valentine. The movie premiered November 12, 2010. Some parts of the movie are filmed in New Zealand. =Plot Alteration= The characters in the film are both renamed and have their mythic alter egos swapped, with respect to the book. In the film Allie (Ellie in the book), rather than Will, is King Arthur (but several characters initially believe otherwise); Mr. Moore (Mr. Morton in the book) is in the film Mordred, replacing Marco; and Miles (instead of Moore/Morton) is Merlin. In the film, Marco reveals himself to be a member of the Order of the Bear, and determined to protect Will (believing him to be Arthur), although Allie initially believes Marco to be Mordred. In the film, Mr. Moore reveals that he suspected Allie to be the Lady of the Lake and is shocked that she is Arthur. The climactic battle scene, which in the book takes place in the ravine, in the film occurs in the school theater (which magically becomes a beach). The students are explained as the reincarnations of their alter egos, as opposed to merely corresponding to them. Allie is an only child; she no longer has a brother. Since Will is not Arthur, some connections are eliminated: Will's father is not trying to make Will join the navy; Will does not sail, nor does he have a dog (in the book there are connections to the names of Arthur's dog and boat). Avalon High's team name is the Knights, not Excalibur. Many potentially violent and threatening scenes were removed and scene settings changed to make the movie more appropriate for younger children.

It is named after Robert Baillie, Carl Pomerance, John Selfridge, and Samuel Wagstaff. The Baillie-PSW test is a combination of a strong Fermat probable prime test to base 2 and a strong Lucas probable prime test. The Fermat and Lucas test each have their own list of pseudoprimes, that is, composite numbers that pass the test. For example, the first ten strong pseudoprimes to base 2 are : 2047, 3277, 4033, 4681, 8321, 15841, 29341, 42799, 49141, and 52633 . The first ten strong Lucas pseudoprimes (with Lucas parameters (P, Q) defined by Selfridge's Method A) are : 5459, 5777, 10877, 16109, 18971, 22499, 24569, 25199, 40309, and 58519 . There is no known overlap between these lists of strong Fermat pseudoprimes and strong Lucas pseudoprimes, and there is even evidence that the numbers in these lists tend to be different kinds of numbers. For example, Fermat pseudoprimes to base 2 tend to fall into the residue class 1 (mod m) for many small m, whereas Lucas pseudoprimes tend to fall into the residue class −1 (mod m). As a result, a number that passes both a strong Fermat and a strong Lucas test is very likely to be prime. No composite number below 264 (approximately 1.845·1019) passes the Baillie-PSW test. Consequently, this test is a deterministic primality test on numbers below that bound. There are also no known composite numbers above that bound that pass the test, in other words, there are no known Baillie-PSW pseudoprimes. Despite this, there are conjectured to be infinitely many. In 1980 the authors Pomerance, Selfridge, and Wagstaff offered $30 for the discovery of a counterexample, that is, a composite number that passed this test. Richard Guy incorrectly stated that the value of this prize had been raised to $620, but he was confusing the Lucas sequence with the Fibonacci sequence, and his remarks really apply only to a Conjecture of Selfridge's.Guy, R. (1994). \\"Pseudoprimes. Euler Pseudoprimes. Strong Pseudoprimes.\\" §A12 in Unsolved Problems in Number Theory. 2nd ed., p. 28, New York: Springer-Verlag. . As of June 2014 the prize remains unclaimed. However, a heuristic argument by Pomerance suggests that there are infinitely many counterexamples. Moreover, Chen and Greene have constructed a set S of 1248 primes such that, among the nearly 21248 products of distinct primes in S, there may be about 740 counterexamples. However, they are talking about the weaker PSW test that substitutes a Fibonacci test for the Lucas one. The test Let n be the odd positive integer that we wish to test for primality. # Optionally, perform trial division to check if n is divisible by a small prime number less than some convenient limit. # Perform a base 2 strong probable prime test. If n is not a strong probable prime base 2, then n is composite; quit. # Find the first D in the sequence 5, −7, 9, −11, 13, −15, ... for which the Jacobi symbol (D/n) is −1. Set P = 1 and Q = (1 − D) / 4. # Perform a strong Lucas probable prime test on n using parameters D, P, and Q. If n is not a strong Lucas probable prime, then n is composite. Otherwise, n is almost certainly prime. Remarks. # The first step is for efficiency only. The Baillie-PSW test works without this step, but if n has small prime factors, then the quickest way to show that n is composite is to find a factor by trial division. # Step 2 is, in effect, a single application of the Miller-Rabin primality test, but using the fixed base 2. There is nothing special about using base 2; other bases might work just as well. However, much work has been done (see above) to verify that the combination of the base 2 strong probable prime test and a strong Lucas test does a good job of distinguishing primes from composites. # Baillie and Wagstaff proved in Theorem 9 on page 1413 of that the average number of Ds that must be tried is about 3.147755149. # If n is a perfect square, then step 3 will never yield a D with (D/n) = −1; this is not a problem because perfect squares are easy to detect using Newton's method for square roots. If step 3 fails to produce a D quickly, one should check whether n is a perfect square. # Given n, there are other methods for choosing D, P, and Q. What is important is that the Jacobi symbol (D/n) be −1. Bressoud and Wagon explain why we want the Jacobi symbol to be −1, as well as why one gets more powerful primality tests if Q ≠ ±1. # Section 6 of recommends that if Q ≠ ±1, a good primality test should also check two additional congruence conditions. These two congruences involve almost no extra computational cost, and are only rarely true if n is composite: V_{n+1} \\\\equiv 2 Q \\\\pmod {n} and Q^{(n+1)/2} = Q \\\\cdot Q^{(n-1)/2} \\\\equiv Q \\\\cdot \\\\left(\\\\tfrac{Q}{n}\\\\right) \\\\pmod {n} . # There are weaker versions of the Baillie-PSW test, and this one is sometimes referred to as the Strong Baillie-PSW test. # If the Lucas test is replaced by a Fibonacci test, then it shouldn't be called a Baillie-PSW test, but rather a Selfridge test or a PSW test. See Selfridge's Conjecture on Primality Testing. # Pomerance, Selfridge and Wagstaff offered $30 in 1980 for a composite number passing a weaker version of the Baillie-PSW test. Such a number passing the (strong) Baillie-PSW test would qualify. The danger of relying only on Fermat tests There is significant overlap among the lists of pseudoprimes to different bases. Choose a base a. If n is a pseudoprime to base a, then n is likely to be one of those few numbers that is a pseudoprime to many bases. For example, n = 341 is a pseudoprime to base 2. It follows from Theorem 1 on page 1392 of that there are 100 values of a (mod 341) for which 341 is a pseudoprime base a. (The first ten such a are 1, 2, 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 27, 29, and 30). The proportion of such a compared to n is usually much smaller. Therefore, if n is a pseudoprime to base a, then n is more likely than average to be a pseudoprime to some other base. For example, there are 21853 pseudoprimes to base 2 up to 25·109. This is only about two out of every million odd integers in this range. However: * 4709 of these 21853 numbers (over 21 percent) are also pseudoprimes to base 3; * 2522 of these 4709 numbers (over 53 percent) are pseudoprimes to bases 2, 3, and 5; * 1770 of these 2522 numbers (over 70 percent) are pseudoprimes to bases 2, 3, 5, and 7. 29341 is the smallest pseudoprime to bases 2 through 12. All of this suggests that probable prime tests to different bases are not independent of each other, so that performing Fermat probable prime tests to more and more bases will give diminishing returns. On the other hand, the calculations in and the calculations up to 264 mentioned above suggest that Fermat and Lucas probable prime tests are independent, so that a combination of these types of tests would make a powerful primality test, especially if the strong forms of the tests are used. Note that a number that is pseudoprime to all prime bases 2, ..., p is also pseudoprime to all bases that are p-smooth. There is also overlap among strong pseudoprimes to different bases. For example, 1373653 is the smallest strong pseudoprime to bases 2 through 4, and 3215031751 is the smallest strong pseudoprime to bases 2 through 10. Arnault gives a 397-digit Carmichael number N that is a strong pseudoprime to all prime bases less than 307. Because this N is a Carmichael number, N is also a (not necessarily strong) pseudoprime to all bases less than p, where p is the 131-digit smallest prime factor of N. A quick calculation shows that N is not a Lucas probable prime when D, P, and Q are chosen by the method described above, so this number would be correctly determined by the Baillie-PSW test to be composite. Applications of combined Fermat and Lucas primality tests The following computer algebra systems and software packages use some version of the Baillie–PSW primality test. Maple's isprime function ,isprime - Maple Help documentation at maplesoft.com. Mathematica's PrimeQ function ,Wolfram Language & System Documentation Center - Some Notes on Internal Implementation documentation at wolfram.com. PARI/GP's isprime and ispseudoprime functions ,User's Guide to PARI/GP (version 2.11.1) documentation for PARI/GP. and SageMath's is_pseudoprime function SageMath Documentation documentation for SageMath. all use a combination of a Fermat strong probable prime test and a Lucas test. Maxima's primep function uses such a test for numbers greater than 341550071728321 .Maxima Manual documentation for Maxima. The FLINT library has functions n_is_probabprime and n_is_probabprime_BPSW that use a combined test, as well as other functions that perform Fermat and Lucas tests separately .FLINT: Fast Library for Number Theory documentation for FLINT 2.5. The BigInteger class in standard versions of Java and in open-source implementations like OpenJDK, has a method called isProbablePrime. This method does one or more Miller-Rabin tests with random bases. If n, the number being tested, has 100 bits or more, this method also does a non-strong Lucas test that checks whether Un+1 is 0 (mod n). BigInteger.java DocJar: Search Open Source Java API. BigInteger.java documentation for OpenJDK. The use of random bases in the Miller-Rabin tests has an advantage and a drawback compared to doing a single base 2 test as specified in the Baillie–PSW test. The advantage is that, with random bases, one can get a bound on the probability that n is composite. The drawback is that, unlike the Baillie–PSW test, one cannot say with certainty that if n is less than some fixed bound such as 264, then n is prime. In Perl, the Math::PrimalityMath::Primality Perl module with BPSW test and Math::Prime::UtilMath::Prime::Util Perl module with primality tests including BPSWMath::Prime::Util::GMP Perl module with primality tests including BPSW, using C+GMP modules have functions to perform the strong Baillie-PSW test as well as separate functions for strong pseudoprime and strong Lucas tests. In Python, the NZMATHNZMATH number theory calculation system in Python library has the strong pseudoprime and Lucas tests, but does not have a combined function. The SymPy library does implement this. As of 6.2.0, GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library's mpz_probab_prime_p function uses a strong Lucas test and a Miller-Rabin test; previous versions did not make use of Baillie-PSW.GNU MP 6.2.0 Prime Testing Algorithm documentation for GMPLIB. Magma's IsProbablePrime and IsProbablyPrime functions use 20 Miller- Rabin tests for numbers > 34·1013, but do not combine them with a Lucas probable prime test.Magma Computational Algebra System - Primes and Primality Testing documentation for Magma. Cryptographic libraries often have prime- testing functions. Albrecht et al. discuss the tests used in these libraries. Some use a combined Fermat and Lucas test; many do not. For some of the latter, Albrecht, et al. were able to construct composite numbers that the libraries declared to be prime.
