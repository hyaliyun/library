The Barge, designed to help support a more sustainable city, had three main areas of focus: marine ecology and conservation, sustainability, and alternative agriculture. It is completely off-grid and off-pipe and provided approximately enough energy and food production to support an average American family. In its first year, over 3000 students came aboard to learn about the innovative technology on the Barge. The vessel opened to the public on Saturdays. The Miami Science Barge was conceived by Nathalie Manzano and designed by Manzano and Ted Caplow. They were inspired by the Science Barge built in 2006 by New York Sun Works, designed by Caplow. The vessels were of similar size and both had a sustainable technology focus, but they responded to very different local environments and housed differing technology and unique public education programs. The Miami Science Barge emphasized aquaculture. The Miami Science Barge was donated in April 2017 to the brand-new Philip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science, who took over operations. The Miami Science Barge is no longer in use.  Early history  In 2015, Nathalie Manzano and Ted Caplow of CappSci won the Knight Cities Challenge grant competition from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation with a proposal to build the Miami Science Barge. The Barge was a 120x30 steel construction barge from Grady Marine retrofitted with 2nd-hand shipping containers in 2015. With the generosity of Beau Payne of P & L Towing, the staff of CappSci were able to design and build the power system and exhibits of the Barge on the Miami River prior to moving it to its official location in Museum Park in downtown Miami, FL. The Miami Science Barge opened on Earth Day, April 22, 2016. The following April, the Barge was gifted to Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science.  Technical details  The Miami Science Barge has three main areas of focus: =Sustainability = The Barge is fully off-grid. It utilizes 48 solar panels (donated by JinkoSolar) to generate enough power to run all of its systems. These panels are set into five arrays including a solar dance floor and a solar tracking system. Power is stored into two sets of batteries: lead-acid batteries, and experimental Aquion M-Line battery modules. The panels provide about 75Kwh. It is also off-pipe, meaning that all of its fresh water comes from a rainwater catchment system located about the classroom area. The water is stored in a 900-gallon cistern. The salt water comes directly from Biscayne Bay. No discharge is released from the Barge. Waste water is collected in constructed wetland troughs where the water is filtered or in some cases may evaporate. Furthermore, the Barge aimed to utilize only sustainable material in construction, i.e. the Kebony deck throughout the farm area. Kebony is an eco- friendly alternative to tropical hardwoods, using a bio-based seal instead of a synthetic one. The staff on the Barge also follow strict habits of sustainability, including prohibiting single-use plastics from being used on board for events and by diligently cleaning debris found in the notch. =Alternative agriculture= On board are a variety of sustainable and unconventional agriculture systems including hydroponics, aeroponics, aquaculture, and aquaponics. Hydroponics and aeroponics are forms of growing produce that utilizes water and nutrients most efficiently. Aquaculture systems grow fish and other marine creature for consumption so as not to harm the balance in the ocean and aquaponics is a combination of aquaculture and aquaponics, where marine life produce waste which is consumed by plants. On board is also a vertically integrated greenhouse (patented by Caplow and Zak W. Adams). =Marine ecology and conservation= Along with the aquaponic and aquaculture tanks, there are multiple tanks showcasing marine life. Towards the entrance of the Barge, there is a coral tank, developed with the help of Dr. Diego Lirman at the University of Miami and Rescue a Reef. It is the only tank in South Florida representing what coral restoration in the wild looks like. Other exhibit tanks show sea life from Biscayne Bay, including sea horses, a giant hermit crab, erosion-preventing sea grasses, mangroves, and a myriad of local fish. These tanks are used to educate about the importance of diversity in Miami‚Äôs local ecology. Guest scientists are invited most weekends and on the 3rd Wednesday of every month for Sip of Science to promote the conservation of the environment.  Response  The Miami Science Barge opened on Earth Day, April 22, 2016 and was attended by dignitary speakers including City of Miami Commissioner Frank Carollo, who in his remarks called the Barge \\"a symbol of Miami's diversity not only in people, but in ideas, as well as, a symbol of our community's commitment to environmental education,\\" Miami Dade County Public Schools Superintendent Alberto Carvalho, Knight Foundation‚Äôs Miami Program Director Matt Haggman, and Children Trust‚Äôs Founding Board Chair David Lawrence, Jr. In December 2016, Miami Science Barge was named one of ‚ÄúThe Ten Best Things to Do in Downtown Miami‚Äù by Miami New Times  References  Category:Science education in the United States Category:Marine biology Category:Laboratories in the United States Category:2016 establishments in Florida ","title":"Miami Science Barge"},{"id":"53993058","text":"The canton of Dourdan is an administrative division of the Essonne department, √éle-de-France region, northern France.

Originally the president was elected by the Coll√®ge des Notables (an assembly of \\"notable electors\\") that included around 80,000 county and city/town councillors (who had been elected locally). Following constitutional reform in November 1962 (the constitutional Act of 6 November), pushed by President de Gaulle, the president has been directly elected by the people of France in a two-round election. Until a 24 September 2000 constitutional referendum, the president had been elected for a seven-year term since 1974. With the referendum being successful, the term was reduced to five years. Therefore once the winner of the 2002 election, Jacques Chirac, took office as president, the next election was scheduled for 2007 rather than 2009. Currently, the President of the French Republic is elected to a five-year term in a two-round election under Article 7 of the Constitution: if no candidate secures an absolute majority (including blank and void ballots) of votes in the first round, a second round is held two weeks later between the two candidates who received the most votes. Since 1965, when the current (direct) election system was introduced, every election has gone to a second round. The latest election was in 2017. The first round was held on 23 April 2017, the second on 7 May. The next presidential election, barring unforeseen circumstances, is scheduled to be held in April and May 2022.

Sarkozy aimed to be a candidate again in 2016, but was defeated in his party's primary. * Two Presidents, Mitterrand and Chirac, had lost at least once in the second round before being elected. They are also the only candidates to have qualified for three or more second round runoffs (Chirac 3, Mitterrand 4). Giscard d'Estaing (2) and Sarkozy (2) are the only other candidates to have been to the runoff twice or more. * Only three Prime Ministers, de Gaulle, Georges Pompidou and Chirac, were subsequently elected president. Many others have tried and lost. * Only one parent-child pair have made it to the second round: Jean-Marie Le Pen in 2002 and his daughter Marine in 2017. * Only two women have reached the second round: S√©gol√®ne Royal in 2007 and Marine Le Pen in 2017. * Three winners of the first round lost in the second round: Mitterrand in 1974, Giscard d'Estaing in 1981 and Jospin in 1995. * The highest percentage of votes won in the second round was by Chirac in 2002 with 82.21%, followed by Macron in 2017 with 66.10%. * The 2017 second round was the first in which neither candidate represented a major parliamentary party.

Her work consists of paintings, embroideries, tapestries, and sculptures. Themes of her work relate to humanity's primal instincts and animality, male-female dynamics, balance of power between the sexes, domination and submission, and fear and desire. Her works have been shown in solo and group exhibitions in Europe and the U.S.  Work  Khatibi cites Frida Kahlo, Hieronymus Bosch, and Henry Darger as her sources of inspiration. Khatibi's paintings often resemble Renaissance imagery, with groups of almost transparent nude female figures against backgrounds of pastel-coloured landscapes. The ghost-like women interact with the surrounding wildlife and explore their animal impulses. Her work is seen as putting \\"a contemporary spin on surrealism and the uncanny.\\" A self-taught artist, Khatibi is described as \\"guided by an untamed instinct\\", and \\"each work seems to be an invitation to a sexual game, tender or brutal, romantic or savage.\\" Khatibi explains, ‚ÄúNo matter how much society tries to cover it up, no matter how polite and educated we act, our impulses remain primitive.‚Äù The emotional tone of her work is considered benign, despite the underlying themes: \\"Along with the apparent bestiality and the violence of the depicted scenes, the artist keeps an amused eye on the joyful carnival.\\" Furthermore, \\"her female subjects are presented as protagonists, not victims. They hunt, tame, or seduce the wild beasts, rather than being ravaged by them.\\" Khatibi says her female figures are \\"the predators, the dominant figures, who are quite impulsive and playful... often depicted within the same plane as the flora and fauna.\\" A review notes that \\"the women have an ambiguous relationship with power, violence, sensuality, and one another.\\" Khatibi adds that ‚ÄúI suppose they are all me‚Äîand they are all bits and pieces of us all.‚Äù Her series, \\"The Murders of the Green River,\\" exhibited in 2019 at the Rodolphe Janssen gallery in Brussels, examined the crimes of the serial killer Gary Ridgway in the Green River area of Washington State.

It was featured on Good Morning America, The Queen Latifah Show, local TV and radio, and countless blogs; it was also translated by fans into multiple languages. The Mrs' Magic Mirror was taken on tour around Texas and to Los Angeles, Minneapolis, New York, and was made into an iPhone app. The popularity of the ‚ÄúMagic Mirror‚Äù video pushed \\"Enough\\" onto the charts after its official release, in August 2015. In November 2015, after the release of the Enough EP (dated Sep 23, 2015), the title track reached Number 10 on FMQB Adult Contemporary Top 200. During this period, it was one of the most added tracks in independent radio station playlists. Following Enough, the band partnered with SAFE, an Austin-based nonprofit working to end sexual assault and exploitation, child abuse, and domestic violence, to release \\"Draw the Line\\" and drive awareness during Sexual Assault Awareness Month in April 2016. On March 10, 2017, the band released their first full-length, self-titled album, The Mrs, consisting of eleven tracks. And EP, Five Minutes, was released on September 7, 2018.  Collaborations  The early days of The Mrs were spent under the tutelage of Grammy-award winning engineer/producer/songwriter/musician Robert Arbittier, who made his career working with Stevie Wonder as a touring keyboardist and programmer, and whose songwriting and producing credits include such names as Michael Jackson and Whitney Houston. Arbittier and business partner Gary Odante (engineer, Songs in the Key of Life, ‚ÄùGary Olazabal‚Äù) were the production team for The Mrs' early singles and the Enough EP. Arbittier also at times served as musical director and manager for the band. The band co- wrote their hit single ‚ÄúEnough‚Äù with Arbittier, as well as an unreleased song, ‚ÄúYou Were There.‚Äù From 2013 to 2016 The Mrs worked with many Platinum and Grammy-award winning songwriters: * Weeks after forming, in August 2013, the band met with British songwriter Pam Sheyne, best known for co-writing Christina Aguilera's Grammy Award-winning single, \\"Genie in a Bottle.\\" Three songs from this writing session were penned at Steven Tyler's oceanside Maui retreat: \\"The Mrs,\\" \\"Tug of Love,\\" and \\"Between the Sheets.‚Äù * ‚ÄúYou Told Me‚Äù was written with L.A.-based, husband-wife songwriting team, Joerg Kohring and Jessica Niven-Kohring. * The 2016 single ‚ÄúLight it Up‚Äù was co-written by musician Wes Cunningham and acclaimed song-writer Rob Arbittier. Rob has worked with a diverse group of artists, including Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Whitney Houston, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and Jennifer Lopez. * The band called upon singer/songwriter Susan Gibson, writer of the Dixie Chicks hit \\"Wide Open Spaces,‚Äù to help them approach the task of writing a song of hope for people who have suffered from domestic violence and sexual assault. The creation of The Mrs‚Äô 2016 single, ‚ÄúDraw the Line,‚Äù also involved a partnership with SAFE (then SafePlace and Austin Children‚Äôs Shelter). All proceeds from the sale of the single go to benefit SAFE and its programs. This partnership also marked a new collaboration with musical producer Dwight Baker, who produced the song at his Matchbox Studios in Austin. In 2016, the band pulled in the production team of Jimmy McGorman and Robb Vallier to help create what would become 2017‚Äôs full-length album release, The Mrs team spent two weekends in Austin with the band, which resulted in 11 songs written in The Mrs' signature roundtable style. Pre-production began immediately, and the bulk of the recording took place at Arlyn Studios in Austin, over the course of eight days in late March, 2016. The album was mixed by Chris Thompson and mastered by Rueben Coehn.  Charity Work  Philanthropy is central to the operation of The Mrs. In addition to their cornerstone outreach project, the Magic Mirror, which has helped thousands to see themselves in a more positive light, their extensive charity work‚Äîboth as entertainment and as a sponsor‚Äîincludes working with organizations such as SAFE, Hand To Hold, National Eating Disorder Association, Just Keep Livin‚Äô Foundation, Survive 2 Thrive, Seton Breast Cancer Foundation, Dell Children‚Äôs Hospital Blood and Cancer Center, Center for Child Protection, The Kindness Campaign, and many others.  Awards and Recognitions  The Mrs received an official decree from the City of Austin that April 8, 2016 was to be called ‚ÄúDraw the Line Day‚Äù in the city. Mayor Steve Adler praised The Mrs for writing their song ‚ÄúDraw the Line,‚Äù the purpose of which was to bring awareness to the local organization SAFE (Stop Abuse For Everyone) and its work to eradicate domestic violence and sexual assault.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. It is now the Muskegon County Convention & Visitor's Bureau. History In 1871, the Michigan Lake Shore Railroad was built, connecting Muskegon with Chicago. This railroad was later folded in the Chicago and West Michigan Railroad. In the 1880s, two more rail lines were extended into Muskegon: the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad and the Toledo, Saginaw and Muskegon Railway. However, by the early 1890s, the depot located on Third Street was badly in need of refurbishing. In 1893, all three railways and the city agreed that constructing a new depot would be in the best interests of all parties, particularly with the rise in excursion traffic to local resorts. In 1893, architect Sidney J. Osgood developed plans for this new depot. Architect Amos W. Rush soon took over the project, but actual construction was delayed until 1894 due to the Panic of 1893. The depot was completed and opened in 1895. The depot was taken over by the Pere Marquette Railroad, in 1899. Despite the Union Depot name, by the 1930s, the Toledo, Saginaw and Muskegon Railway (being absorbed by the Grand Trunk Western) trains were by that point using a different station in the city.Official Guide of the Railways, February 1932, Index of Railroad Stations, 1624 By 1938, the trains of the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad, by then acquired by the Pennsylvania Railroad were moved over to the same station as the Grand Trunk trains.Official Guide of the Railways, August 1938, Index of Railroad Stations, 1430 Union Depot was the destination of one of the sections of the Pere Marquette's Night Express from Chicago.Official Guide of the Railways, August 1938, Pere Marquette section, Tables 1, 11 Eventually the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O;) when C&O; absorbed the Pere Marquette Railroad in 1947. However, with the growth of the automobile, passenger railway service declined, and the depot ceased passenger operation in 1971. Freight service continued for two more years, but the building stood vacant from 1978 until the early 1990s, when it was donated to Muskegon County. The building was restored in 1994 and 1995, and reopened as the Muskegon County Convention & Visitor's Bureau. Description The Muskegon Union Depot is a two-story Richardsonian Romanesque railroad station with a connected four-story tower and a massive hipped roof. The walls are constructed from red brick and rock- face sandstone, and the roof eaves flare outward from the main mass of the building. The building is nearly symmetrical, with only a portion of the structure that formerly housed the baggage room extending to one side to break the symmetry. The main entry is through a deep portico formed by a massive sandstone arch. The side elevations have overhanging roofs, creating deep entry porches that approach the platform in the rear of the building. The rear elevation contains a half-hexagonal bay formerly housing the ticket office. On the interior, the main waiting room contains a large ornamental brick fireplace with a wood mantel, and the walls contain quarter-sawn oak woodwork and wainscot paneling with egg and dart trim. The ceiling is covered with original pressed metal panels. The original ladies' waiting room has been converted into an exhibit space, and the original gentlemen's smoking room has also been converted into an exhibit space. The second floor is less than half the size of the first floor, and was originally used as railroad offices and storage. It now contains a large conference room, small restrooms, offices, storage, and a boiler room. The upper floors of the tower are now used only for mechanical systems.

Zaborov, was working. Abram's maternal grandfather worked as a bailiff at the estate of a gentleman from Liozna. The circumstances forced the family to leave Liozna and return to Abram's father's native town of Velizh. There Abram Zaborov entered a 7-year Jewish school, where he first demonstrated his artistic talent. This was the period of the Russian Civil War. Soviet propaganda needed the artists to create propaganda posters and slogans. Abram Zaborov was quite successful in drawing posters. His drawing teacher was Marfa Nikolaevna Volkova, the mother of the future famous Belarusian painter Anatoly Volkov. After graduating from high school, Abram Zaborov entered Vitebsk Painting School, which he finished in 1930. After that Abram Zaborov moved to Minsk, where he spent most of his artistic career. In 1935 he became the father of the future famous artist Boris Zaborov. Among Zaborov's pre-WWII paintings are \\"New people, new city\\" and \\"Chapaev\\". The latter was demonstrated at the Young Painters of the Soviet Union Exhibition dedicated to 20 years of Komsomol and took place in 1939. This painting made him famous in the Soviet Union. In 1940 at the Exhibition \\"10 days of Belarusian Art\\", Abram Zaborov presented the painting \\"Where is my Son?\\". The reproduction of the painting was later published in the Tvorchestvo magazine. Abram Zaborov fought as a soldier during World War II. After the war was over, he returned to Minsk. He became the member of the Union of Painters of the Soviet Union. Some of his paintings are exhibited at The National Art Museum of the Republic of Belarus. In 1979 Abram Zaborov repatriated to Israel. One of his paintings is exhibited at the Knesset.

In mythology, fertility deities exist in different belief systems or religions. Fertility deities A fertility deity is a god or goddess in mythology associated with fertility, pregnancy, and birth. In some cases these deities are directly associated with sex, and in others they simply embody related attributes. Fertility rites Sao Goncalo Pastries. erotic pastry from Portugal claimed to have originated with Celtic fertility rites Fertility rites are religious rituals that reenact sexual acts actually or symbolically. They may include sacrifices of animals and at times humans.Max Weber, The Sociology of Religion (London 1965) p. 236 Demeter was the central deity in fertility rites held in classical Greece. Her rites included celebrating the change of seasons.M. I. Finley, The World of Odysseus (Penguin 1967) p. 158 Most women's festivals related in some way to woman's proper function as a fertile being (believed to allow women to promote the fertility of crops).J. Boardman et al eds., The Oxford History of the Classical World (Oxford 1991) p. 269-70 Because of his link to the grape harvest, however, it is not surprising to see Dionysus associated with Demeter and Kore in the Eleusinian Mysteries.F. Guirand ed., The New Larousse Encyclopedia of Mythology (1968) p. 160 In Ancient Phoenicia, a special sacrifice was conducted in the harvest season to reawaken the spirit of the vine; while another winter fertility rite was performed to restore the spirit of the withering vine. The sacrifice included cooking a kid in the milk of its mother, a Canaanite custom which Mosaic law condemned and formally forbade.Guirand, p. 77-9 According to Ibn Ishaq, the Kaaba was formerly worshipped as a female deity. Circumambulation was often performed naked by male and sometimes female pilgrims, and worship associated with fertility goddesses. Some have noted the apparent similarity of the Black Stone and its silver frame to the external female genitalia. Fertility symbols A typical Shiva lingam Fertility symbols were generally considered to have been used since Prehistoric times for encouraging fertility in women, although it is also used to show creation in some cultures. Wedding cakes are a form of fertility symbols. In Ancient Rome, the custom was for the groom to break a cakes over the bride‚Äôs head to symbolize the end of the bride‚Äôs virginal state, ensure fertility, and the beginning of her husband‚Äôs power over her. Fertility symbols were used by Native Americans, the most common being a supernatural figure called Kokopelli, a fertility deity usually depicted as a hunchback, dancing flute player carrying a sack also shown with a large phallus. The deity presides over childbirth and agriculture. In Hinduism, Shiva is symbolized and worshiped in a form called Lingam, which shows his phallus merged with vulva of Shakti, his consort. Lingam is the most powerful fertility symbol in Hinduism, showing the critical union of Shiva and Shakti. Shiva is depicted with River Ganges and moon on his head. He wears garlands of snakes called Naga. The Ganga, moon and snakes are fertility symbols, and associated with fertility rituals in Hinduism.William McCormack, in A. K.

In total, 5,371 residences were flooded, 4,066 people were forced from their homes, and 261 municipalities were affected, largely in the Outaouais Region, the Greater Montreal Area, the Mont√©r√©gie, the Mauricie, the Gasp√©sie and the C√¥te-Nord regions. The floods were listed as the third most significant weather event of 2017 by the Canadian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society. Montreal and Laval then declared a state of emergency over the flooding. Background While rising water levels due to melting snow and ice is common in the spring, cool weather and large spring snowstorms added to the issue. The March 2017 North American blizzard added another 70 centimeters of snow along the Saint Lawrence River Valley. This issue was exacerbated by heavy rain in April and early May 2017. Montreal alone received 156 millimeters of rain in April, twice the monthly average and nearly beating the record of 159 mm from 2005. First floods In the beginning of April, rising temperatures led to melting snow, which increased water levels in the Chaudi√®re River. On 10 April, Quebec Route 276 was briefly closed between Saint-Joseph-de-Beauce and Saint-Joseph-des-√ârables due to flooding, and minor flooding was reported in communities in the watershed. In the Eastern Townships, several communities were affected by the floodwaters, closing roads in ten municipalities, including Danville, Lingwick, Saint-Ludger and Ayer's Cliff, with the communities of Asbestos and Weedon being the worst hit. Major flooding =Mauricie= On 30 April, the level of the Saint-Maurice River began to rise, causing concern among the public. The rising floodwaters washed out portions of Quebec Route 155 (one of the only links between the towns of La Tuque and Trois-Rivi√®res) and the road between La Tuque and the Atikamekw community of Wemotaci. Route 155 remained closed to traffic until 8 May, when it was reopened to all but heavy vehicles. Until this point, people traveling between La Tuque and Trois-Rivieres needed to drive through the Saugenay Region, then down to Quebec City and Autoroute 40, which tripled the amount of travel time. =Outaouais= Flooding began in the Outaouais region on 20 April, when the Ottawa River flooded areas of Pontiac, while the Petite- Nation River flooded roads in the town of Saint-Andr√©-Avellin. Surrounding towns of Ripon, Cayamant, Duhamel, Gracefield, Montpellier and Waltham also experienced flooding, isolating some residents. Portions of Quebec Autoroute 50 were flooded on 7 May after nearly two feet of rain over the proceeding two days. Emergency work by Transports Quebec reopened two lanes of the three-lane highway by 9 May. The closure of Autoroute 50 and surrounding flooding caused both the federal government and provincial government to close their offices in Gatineau, rather than have employees risk coming in. Transport Quebec closed several roads on 7 May, including the Galipeault Bridge, due to rising water levels. The Ottawa River crested on 8 May for most citizens in the Ottawa River Valley, specifically between Mattawa and Hawkesbury, Ontario. In Gatineau, the river reached a level of 45.08 meters, down 10 centimeters from previous reports. The local fire department in Gatineau rescued and evacuated approximately 533 people, with the Red Cross providing shelter for close to 1000. In Ottawa, Mayor Jim Watson said that 346 residences had been flooded in the city, with 90% of them found in West Carleton-March Ward. As of 10 May, the Canadian military had stationed 2,200 troops in Quebec, as well as dozens of military boats, helicopters, armoured vehicles and engineering equipment, and a naval frigate, . =Mont√©r√©gie= Towns between Montreal and Ottawa, faced flooding near the end of April. This area is where the Ottawa River and the St. Lawrence River meet, and includes Lac Saint-Louis, Lac Saint-Fran√ßois and Lac des Deux-Montagnes. The town of Rigaud declared a state of emergency on 20 April to deal with rising floodwaters, calling for the evacuation of 470 households. =Montreal= The hardest hit areas on the Island of Montreal were communities close to the Rivi√®re des Prairies, including Pierrefonds- Roxboro and L'√éle-Bizard‚ÄìSainte-Genevi√®ve See also *History of flooding in Canada References Category:2017 disasters in Canada Quebec floods Category:2017 in Quebec Category:Floods in Canada Category:May 2017 events in Canada Category:Natural disasters in Quebec ","title":"2017 Quebec floods"},{"id":"53993590","text":"Jorge Nasser in 2011.

Selvaraj (died 25 November 2012) was an Indian politician and a minister in the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam-led Government of Tamil Nadu between 1996 and 2001.  Political career  Selvaraj was elected to the Tamil Nadu legislative assembly as a Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) candidate from Samayanallur constituency in the 1996 election. The constituency was reserved for candidates from the Scheduled Castes. Selvaraj was a Dalit and served as Minister for Adi Dravidar Welfare, Hill Tribes and Bonded Labour during the DMK-led government of 1996-2001. In October 1998, he was one of four DMK ministers sent to help relieve tensions in Ramanathapuram district after violence between Dalits and members of the Thevar caste had resulted in 11 deaths. Later, in the 2001 elections, the perceived pro-Dalit stance of the DMK resulted in a backlash by voters from the Other Backwards Classes and Selvaraj's assembly seat was among those lost.  Legal issues  There was confusion in 2011 when Selvaraj and 27 other DMK members were arrested in relation to a charge dating from 2001 when they had protested against the arrest of Karunanidhi, the former DMK Chief Minister. The defendants thought that the case had been withdrawn. He had also been investigated in 2002 when the new Chief Minister, Jayalalithaa of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) targeted several officials from the prior DMK government whom she considered held assets that were disproportionate to their income. There were suggestions that Jayalalithaa was engaging in a political tit-for- tat related to court cases filed against AIADMK people by the DMK when that party had been in power. By July 2003, virtually all of the 24 ministers of the former DMK government were under investigation, and Selvaraj was one of three against whom chargesheets had been issued.  Death  Selvaraj, who had been suffering ill-health due to a kidney problem, died on 25 November 2012, aged 66 or 67. He was cremated in his home village of Meenakshipuram Pudur and was survived by a son and two daughters. One of his daughters, B.

It was developed by the Brazilian engineer Otto Pfafstetter in 1989. It is designed such that topological information is embedded in the code, which makes it easy to determine whether an event in one river basin will affect another by direct examination of their codes.Watershed Topology - The Pfafstetter System , by Jordan Furnans and Francisco Olivera History and use An example of a river system coded with the Pfafstetter coding system. The main tributary water basins are coded with even numbers 2-8, and the inter-basin regions with odd numbers. The code 0 is reserved for basins unconnected to the main stem. Coding continues recursively, with each new digit appended to the previously obtained code In the 1950s, Pfafstetter suggested the use of a hierarchical system of coding river basins, later described in a 1989 paper. The method was applied to Brazilian water networks, and has been used in a number of other applications. Description The Pfafstetter system relies on the properties of the base-10 numbering system. In a water system to be coded, the main stem is defined as the path which drains the greatest area. The four major tributaries, in terms of water drainage, of the main stem are determined, and the water basin of each defined. This results in four tributary basins, as well as five inter-basin regions which are drained by the main stem. Each region is then numbered from 1-9, with the downstream-most inter-basin region denoted 1; therefore, the inter-basin regions and tributary basins are numbered 1,3,5,7,9 and 2,4,6,8 respectively. The number 0 is reserved for closed drainage systems. Each tributary basin is then coded in an identical manner, and the resulting number appended to the end of the tributary basin number. In this manner, the entire waterway may be coded in a recursive manner to an arbitrary precision. Properties The primary advantage of the Pfafstetter system is that the water drainage topology is directly described by the code: * At each level, higher digits denote upstream segments. * Odd digits denote segments on the main stem; even digits denote tributaries of the main stem. Therefore, given a point with code A on the water system, a point with code B is downstream if: * The first exactly n digits of each code match, where n ‚â• 0, AND * The remaining digits of B are: ** less than the remaining digits of A, AND ** all odd. For example, segment 8835 is upstream of segments 8833 and 8811, but not segments 8832, 8821 or 9135. The Pfaffstetter system is a particularly efficient system; n-digit codes can be used in a water system with 10n segments. It compares favourably in this respect to the USGS HUC method.

(Note: large pdf file) The district was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. Description The Muskegon Historic District contains around twenty major buildings, along with a small number of outbuildings, such as carriage houses. The district encompasses both public buildings and private residences, as well as Hackley Park. Notable public buildings include the Hackley Library, Muskegon Museum of Art, and the Hackley School Administration Building. Notable residences include the Charles H. Hackley House, the Hume House, and the John Torrent House. Some other houses are included in the district, and are primarily late Italianate in style form the 1880s. These houses are largely architecturally intact, and are still occupied as private residences. Some significant structures include: *Hackley Public Library (Third and Webster) Funded by an 1888 donation from Charles Hackley, the Hackley Public Library was designed by the Chicago architectural firm of Patton and Fisher. It is a pink granite Romanesque Revival structure with brownstone trim. The library opened in 1890. *St Paul's Episcopal Church (Third and Clay) St Paul's Episcopal Church is a greyish greenstone structure, constructed in 1892. Construction was heavily funded by Thomas Hume. *Muskegon Museum of Art (296 Webster) The Muskegon Museum of Art is a Classical Revival structure designed by S. S. Berman of Chicago. The building and the bulk of the collection was funded by a bequest from Charles Hackley after his death in 1905. The museum opened in 1912. *John Torrent House (Third and Webster) The John Torrent House is a 30-room granite structure built in 1892. *Hackley Park (between Clay & Webster, Third & Fourth) Both the land for Hackley Park and the statues located in the park were donated by Charles Hackley to the city. The statues memorialize Union soldiers, sailors, and leaders during the American Civil War. The Soldiers and Sailors Monument stands at the center of the park, and statues of Abraham Lincoln, David Farragut, Ulysses S. Grant, and William T. Sherman stand at the corners. *Hackley and Hume Houses (Webster and Sixth) These two 1887 Victorian houses and the shared carriage house between them were built for Charles Hackley and his business partner Thomas Hume. History In the late 19th century, Muskegon was the center of the lumbering trade in Michigan. Muskegon residents such as Charles H. Hackley made a fortune in the trade. Hackley spent much of his money on projects in his hometown, constructing a public library in 1890, a school in 1893, and a public art gallery in 1912. He also built his own house nearby in 1887, the same time his business partner Thomas Hume built his house. Hackley Park, in the center of this district, is a memorial to Charles Hackley. John Torrent, another lumberman, built his house in the area in 1892. As of 2017, the Hackley and Hume houses have been professionally restored. and are open to the public as the \\"Hackley & Hume Historic Sites.\\" The Torrent House is owned by the Red Cross.

It was as built from 1925 to 1927 as an apartment hotel and was designed by Emery Roth and Thomas Hastings for journalist Arthur Brisbane, who was the developer. At the time of construction, it was the tallest residential building in New York City. On October 29, 2002, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the Ritz Tower as a New York City landmark.Kurshan, Virginia (October 29, 2002) \\"Ritz Tower Designation Report\\" New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission History The Ritz Tower was built from 1925 to 1927 and opened on October 15, 1926. The building was designed by Emery Roth and Thomas Hastings, formerly of Carr√®re and Hastings, for journalist Arthur Brisbane, who was also the developer. It was built as an apartment hotel, with no individual kitchens in any of the 400 units; food was provided by centralized kitchens using dumbwaiters to pantries on each floor. Since apartment hotels were not subject to the same height restrictions as residential apartment buildings, the developer was able to build taller than would otherwise have been allowed. Brisbane contracted with the Ritz-Carlton Company to manage the building and the restaurants in it, which included Le Pavillon, one of the first authentic French restaurants in the U.S. When it was built, the Ritz Tower was the tallest residential building in New York City. Its classically-inspired design features numerous setbacks with pilasters, pediments and balustrades, and large stone fl√®ches direct the viewer's eye up the building. The lower floors are highly ornamented, featuring sculpted putti, urns, and rusticated stone. The top of the tower has a pyramidal roof with a tall obelisk. The interior of the building utilizes rich material, such as wood paneled walls and parquet floors, all part of Brisbane's desire to make the Ritz Tower the most sought-after apartment hotel in the city. The 19th and 20th floors of the building were taken up by an 18-room duplex apartment designed in 1927 by Thomas Hastings for Arthur Brisbane, the owner of the building. Notable residents Over the years, tenants have included actresses Greta Garbo, Kitty Carlisle, Paulette Goddard, Arlene Francis and her husband, actor Martin Gabel, Deborah Kerr; William Randolph Hearst Jr., the son of the publisher; music producer Clive Davis; radio comedian Goodman Ace; English author Elinor Glyn; TV producer Norman Lear, the creator of All in the Family; playwright Neil Simon and his wife actress Marsha Mason; and William Hays, the head of the \\"Hays Office\\" which censored Hollywood movies.

History  The roots of NFCSO are dated back to the first officially organized animal health service founded by the Animal Health Act VII/1888. The focus of the service has shifted from animal health to food security, then food safety according to the historical needs of Hungary. Sustainability issues and investigation of cases related to economic frauds in the food chain has appeared in the 21st century. NFCSO is the direct legal successor of the Central Agricultural Office (CAO) and the Hungarian Food Safety Office. The CAO was the first food chain control authority in Hungary as the general legal successor of the Plant and Soil Protection Services, the Central Service of Plant and Soil Protection, the Animal Health and Food Control Stations, the National Institute for Agricultural Quality Control, the National Forestry Service, the Agricultural Budget Office, the National Wine Qualification Institute, the Institute of Veterinary Vaccine-, Medicine- and Feed Control, the National Animal Health Institute and the National Food Control Institute, which institutions had worked independently before 1 January 2007.  Responsibilities  From 2012 NFCSO is responsible for the control of the whole food chain from farm to fork, including soil protection, agricultural production, forestry, food processing, retail and catering. Besides this, the most significant suppliers of the food chain are also registered by NFCSO (for instance private laboratories, input material suppliers). The National Food Chain Safety Office operates the food chain laboratory system and the national reference laboratory network. Most of NFCSO's directorates pursue academic activities ranging from life sciences to social sciences. The institution operates two external university departments together with the University of Veterinary Medicine, Budapest and Szent Istv√°n University, Faculty of Food Science. Typical research areas include methodological development of laboratory investigations, risk assessment, food chain network analysis, food consumption patterns and risk perception of consumers. A significant share of the research projects are conducted in cooperation with international and national research institutions and universities. The work of the directorates is coordinated by the president of NFCSO, also acting as deputy chief veterinary officer of Hungary. The activities of NFCSO are supervised by the Ministry of Agriculture and personally the chief veterinary officer of Hungary. The basic principle of organizing the activities of NFCSO is food safety risk analysis as defined by the Codex Alimentarius Commission. Accordingly, besides food risk assessment and risk management, the Office also deals with food safety risk communication (both preventive and crisis communication) and also consumer related programmes, such as campaigns for conscious shopping, education programmes, responsible animal keeping, prevention of food waste, prevention of forest fires.  National and international relations  NFCSO is the official contact point to the European Food Safety Authority and the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed, and the International Food Safety Authorities Network. Officially linked to the Ministry of Agriculture of Hungary and the European Commission's Directorate-General for Health and Food Safety (DG SANTE), the World Health Organization (WHO) and FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarius.

From 1997 to 2002 he served as Ambassador to the United States of America and to Mexico, and from 2005 to 2017 he headed Belarus Hi-Tech Park which became the largest IT cluster in Central and Eastern Europe over that period. Currently he is a governmental expert to the UN Secretary General in the field of information and communication technologies.  Biography  Valery Tsepkalo was born in Grodno on 22 February 1965 to a family of chemical engineers. He graduated from Grodno Secondary school No.14 with advanced program in the English language. In 1982 he entered the Belarusian Technological Institute (currently the Belarusian State Technological University) in Minsk where he studied till 1984. In 1984‚Äî1986 he underwent compulsory military training in the Strategic Missile Forces. After that, he studied at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs and graduated with honors in 1991. He pursued a postgraduate program there, graduated with honors as well, lectured, and got his PhD degree in International Law.  Career  = Diplomatic and political career = He started his diplomatic career in 1991 in the Soviet Embassy in Finland. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, he decided to return to Belarus, and in 1992 he took a position in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Belarus. In 1993‚Äî1994 he was a foreign policy adviser to the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet Stanislau Shushkevich. Later, Shushkevich characterized him as a skilled psychologist and professional. Shushkevich recalls that Tsepkalo helped him at the time when he was in disgrace. Later he became an adviser to the Executive Secretary of the Commonwealth of Independent States.Background (in Russian)–ö—Ç–æ —Ç–∞–∫–æ–π –í–∞–ª–µ—Ä–∏–π –¶–µ–ø–∫–∞–ª–æ Tsepkalo with U.S. President Bill Clinton after he presented his credentials in July 1997. During 1994 presidential campaign, Tsepkalo joined Alexander Lukashenko, along with Viktar Hanchar, Leanid Sinitsyn, Alexander Feduta, and Yury Zacharanka. As some analytics observed, Lukashenko \\"was an outsider, a former farm manager, seen as a man of the people, who unexpectedly beat a pillar of the former communist establishment.\\" Tsepkalo became one of the campaign managers. He arranged Lukashenko‚Äôs visit to Moscow State Duma and the influential LDPR Party to gain additional political weight. After Lukashenko's victory, in 1994 he was appointed First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs. From 1997 to 2002 he served as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Republic of Belarus to the United States and the United Mexican States. Upon completing the diplomatic service in the USA, he was appointed Assistant to the President of Belarus on science and technologies.Valery Tsepkalo = Creation of High Tech Park = The idea to establish the Belarusian Silicon Valley first appeared when Valery Tsepkalo was visiting the Silicon Valley during his diplomatic service in the USA. Tsepkalo was impressed by the effectiveness of the ecosystem, which stimulated the development of technology companies. The success of Belarusian IT companies in the USA made him think about the possibility of creating favorable conditions for the development of technologies in the Republic of Belarus. Created in 2005, the High-Tech Park aimed to stop the outflow of IT specialists abroad. He convinced the authorities to create a special economic zone with tax breaks for tech companies and employees. The government donated an abandoned building on the outskirts of Minsk and guaranteed a 1-year $300,000 loan at 17% interest rate to help get it up and running. On 22 September 2005, Decree On the High-Tech Park was signed, securing benefits for IT-companies. The extraterrestrial High Technologies Park (HTP) was launched in 2005 under Tsepkalo‚Äôs lead. Over the 10-year history of the Belarus Hi-Tech Park, the number of its residents has increased 59 times (from 4 companies in 2006 to 237 companies in 2017), computer software and services exports have evolved 49 times (from $21 million in 2006 to $1025.0 million in 2017), the number of HTP employees has raised 13 times (from 2,506 in 2006 to 32,598 in 2017), and Belarus has improved its ICT Development ranking by 41 positions, according to the International Telecommunication Union.https://dev.by/news/pyat-glavnyh-dostizheniy-tsepkalo- na-postu-glavy-pvt –ü—è—Ç—å –≥–ª–∞–≤–Ω—ã—Ö –¥–æ—Å—Ç–∏–∂–µ–Ω–∏–π –¶–µ–ø–∫–∞–ª–æ –Ω–∞ –ø–æ—Å—Ç—É –≥–ª–∞–≤—ã –ü–í–¢] = Dismissal = On 2 March 2017, Tsepkalo was released by presidential decree from the director‚Äôs post at the HTP. Since 2005 the HTP rose to 237 companies with total annual export over $1 bln. The official media explained the dismissal by the lack of product IT companies and the prevalence of outsourcing developers. After the dismissal, Tsepkalo was criticized by his successor for his selectivity of the HTP residents. Tsepkalo justified his strategy by saying that the first steps are always the hardest to make. The careful selection of the first HTP residents resulted in a high reputation of the Park in the years to follow and a steady flow of investments and orders. After Tsepkalo's dismissal, the new administration focused on statistical growth accepting more than 200 new residents in 2018. = After the HTP = In 2018 he took part in the development of the Mirzo Ulugbek Innovation Center (ICSU) in Uzbekistan. Tsepkalo also consulted governments of Azerbaijan and Georgia on IT legislation issues. He also took part in a large IT project in Saudi Arabia. At present, he is a member of the Strategic Council of the United Nations Global Alliance for ICT and Development. and a government expert to the UN Secretary General in the field of information and communication technologies in the context of information security. On 8 May 2020, Valery Tsepkalo announced about his decision to run for president elections in the Republic of Belarus. = Research and publications = * 80 articles on religion, world economy, and foreign policy. * 20 articles on e-government, information technology, and intellectual property. * Publications in Foreign Affairs, Journal of Congress, Washington Post, Frankfurter Allgemeine, and Horizons. * By the Road of Dragon States book on economic development of new industrialized nations of South-East Asia. * Man Everlasting book on the mystery of death and resurrection. * Hi-Tech Park: 10 Years of Development book on Belarus HTP success story. *Author of patented method of people search based on collateral features.  Presidential Campaign  On 8 May 2020, Tsepkalo announced his candidacy for Belarus presidency. To finance the campaign he sold his 418.3 m¬≤ house on leaseback terms. He announced the start of his presidential election campaign by saying:\\"I would like to restore respect for all citizens of Belarus. I would like to return respect for everyone, no matter who you are, how old and how sick you are. I want to return a respectful attitude to all people of our country.\\" At the press conference, he highlighted the major problem of Belarus: \\"The biggest threat for Belarus is an inefficient economy, an archaic system of government, and poverty. It‚Äôs long past time to reject the obsolete system of government where one person‚Äôs mood sets the tone for the whole nation, every day. It‚Äôs time to give back the power to the people of Belarus.\\" \\"I would like to see the country as a normal European country, where the parliament will reflect the interests of the constituency of their people, not reflect the vision of only one person,\\" Tsepkalo tells me. \\"I would like to make Belarus a normal European country; a normal democratic country. My vision is to make Belarus the high-tech park,\\" he adds. \\"To make a good salary for the whole economy.\\" Lukashenko claimed that Tsepkalo was dismissed as the HTP director for a reason which he should reveal himself. Tsepkalo expained that he was fired because he openly defended Victor Prokopenya and other influential information technology (IT) entrepreneurs, who were detained for their business activities. According to the Belarusian political analyst Artyom Shraibman‚Äôs article for Carnegie Moscow Center, 2020 presidential elections will be special for \\"two prominent members of the establishment\\" ‚Äî Valery Tsepkalo and Viktar Babaryka. The Belarusian philosopher Vladimir Matskevich compared Tsepkalo‚Äôs running for president to 2006 Alyaksandr Kazulin‚Äôs campaign, launched only as a spoiler to the current government. Shraibman mentions the similarities between political programmes of Tsepkalo and Babariko ‚Äî both promise a comprehensive state modernization and economic liberalization, a president to be seen as a manager with a two-term limit, a ‚Äòfriendship with all‚Äô foreign policy. Red Herring also mentioned that Tsepkalo wants to open Belarus‚Äô economy and limit leadership to two terms. During the signature collection period, Tsepkalo toured major cities and towns of Belarus, visiting pickets and meeting with voters. On 24 June, Tsepkalo announced that he had handed over 160 thousand signatures to the Central Election Commission with the required 100 thousand. Registration of candidates for the presidential elections, which will be held on 9 August, is scheduled for 5‚Äì14 July. On 30 June, the Central Election Commission announced that only 75,000 were valid ‚Äî less than the 100,000 needed. Exile (2020-present) On 24 July 2020 Tsepkalo and his two sons fled to Russia after being barred from running in the election and alleged threats of prosecution by the prosecutor's office, which declined to comment on Tsepkalo's escape. On 19 August 2020, it was reported that Tsepkalo was in Poland with his wife and children.https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/08/19/world/europe/19reuters- belarus-election-poland- tsepkalo.htmlhttps://www.thefirstnews.com/article/belarusian-opposition- figure-veronika-tsepkalo-arrives-in-poland-15006 A day later, he met with Polish Foreign Minister Jacek Czaputowicz (who resigned later that day for unrelated reasons) in Warsaw.https://www.interfax.ru/world/722518 In an interview with Fox News after spending two days in the country, Tsepkalo compared the situation to that of during the Nazi occupation of Byelorussia during World War II, saying that \\"People started to demonstrate the traditions of the partisan movement\\" and that \\"People started to associate Lukashenko and his regime with the Nazi occupation that destroyed many Belarusians\\".https://www.foxnews.com/world/belarus-politician-exile-valery- tsapkalo-lukashenko-plea.amp In mid-September, Tsepkalo and his wife Veronika met with Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid in the Estonian city of P√§rnu.https://president.ee/en/meedia/press-releases/16164-president-kaljulaid- met-with-representatives-of-belarusian- opposition/index.htmlhttps://eadaily.com/ru/ampnews/2020/09/17/prezident- estonii-poobeshchala-suprugam-cepkalo-pomoch-v-borbe-za-vlast On 24 September, he met with Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkƒìviƒçs in Riga.https://eng.lsm.lv/article/politics/politics/rinkevics-discusses-belarus- with-belarusian-opposition- representatives.a375653/https://www.mfa.gov.lv/en/news/latest-news/66628-the- foreign-minister-discusses-developments-in-belarus-with-representatives-of- belarusian-opposition  Views  Tsepkalo believes that private property is the basis not only for successful economic and social development, but also serves as a foundation for individuals' personal freedom, dignity and self- esteem. He states that real freedom depends upon individuals' economic sovereignty. To his mind, the aspiration of individuals towards economic freedom and individual independence is the main source of human civilization's evolution. https://realt.by/news/article/27802/ Tsepkalo thinks that property is the embodiment of personality and the main dimension of human existence. It is the condition for the realization of human essence. Therefore, governments should be assessed based on their actions to help their citizens achieve economic freedom as a condition for respect and individual dignity.https://rep.bntu.by/bitstream/handle/data/58540/%d0%a1.%2074-80.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed;=y Tsepkalo with his wife Veronica. In addition, he claims that if possessions simply aim at satisfying human needs such as food, clothing, and shelter, they are essential only for the reproduction of life, i.e. it is the means of satisfying the physical needs of the individual. The possession of the property, such as land ownership, shares, stocks, as well as knowledge and skills signifies not the biological nature of people, but people as social beings. In Tsepkalo's opinion, the possession of property provides for the ability to reflect on oneself and on social life, and the ability to create new environments. These social needs are related to the acknowledgement of the values one possesses and which are worthy of other people's esteem. https://rep.bntu.by/bitstream/handle/data/58540/%d0%a1.%2074-80.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed;=y  Personal life  Married to Veronika Tsepkalo. Veronika is from Mogilev, graduated from Faculty of International Relations (Belarusian State University), then studied at the Higher school of management and business of Belarus State Economic University. Then she studied business management in India, has worked for a major international Corporation for the past 10 years. The couple has two children.  Criticism  = Media pressure after the start of presidency campaign= Tsepkalo's announcement of his campaign was a big surprise for Belarusian society. After his dismissal from HTP, the official media tried to diminish the achievements made by Tsepkalo and the HTP before 2017. The administrative change in the HTP affected the attitude of dev.by, the main internet media about Belarusian IT, affiliated to HTP and its residents, towards Tsepkalo. On the day after the announcement of Tsepkalo running for elections, dev.by published an article attacking Tsepkalo. Tsepkalo was said to have sent an edited version of his interview and was forced by respond to the journalist's insistence by prohibiting to publish the original version. Throughout the election campaign, dev.by used any source of information to attack the reputation of the HTP creator. Such strange behavior of the media which has never been engaged in politics, caused a lot of readers' comments on subjectivity based on personal or political issues. A similar attempt was made by village.me when they made a separate article about users' attempts to edit Tsepkalo's personal page on Russian Wikipedia, which does not contradict Wikipedia normal practice and was used to attract publicity to some provocative (the term was used by the publisher in the article's title) and unconfirmed facts.

It can be used to help understanding how social class affects people's aspirations and involvement in science. The concept comes from research in education but is also used more broadly in practice and policy, for instance in the work of the Science and Technology Committee of the House of Commons in the UK. Definition Science capital can be defined as the sum of all the science-related knowledge, attitudes, experiences and resources that an individual builds up through their life. This includes what science they know about, what they think about science, the people they know who have an understanding of science, and the day-to-day engagement they have with science. Science capital is made up of science related cultural and social capital (institutionalized and/or embodied through knowledge, consumption, credentials, and social networks) as well as habitus. Researchers have suggested that science capital does not exist in isolation but has its value determined by someone's wider context and environment. Science capital has been framed around eight key dimensions, drawing on statistical analysis of survey data from UK school students: # Scientific literacy # Science- related attitudes, values and dispositions # Knowledge about the transferability of science (that science 'open doors' to many careers) # Science media consumption # Participation in out-of-school science learning contexts # Family science skills, knowledge and qualifications # Knowing people in science-related roles # Talking about science in everyday life These eight dimensions collapse into four 'types' of science capital: what you know (scientific literacy); how you think (attitudes and dispositions); what you do (science-related activities and behaviours); and who you know (social contacts and networks). The first three 'types' include habitus and cultural capital and the fourth, social capital. Research shows that measuring science capital provides a better prediction of science aspirations than a general measure of capital. History The concept of science capital draws on Pierre Bourdieu‚Äôs work about capital and social reproduction. Science capital builds on, but is distinct from, how Pierre Bourdieu used the terms scientific, technical or technological capital. Science Capital is not a new or separate form of capital. Instead, science capital is a way to think about grouping different kinds of science-related social and cultural capital, particularly those that people could use or exchange to support their attainment, engagement and/or participation in science. Science capital was first developed by Louise Archer and colleagues in the ASPIRES project. Building on 5 years of research with youths aged 10‚Äì14 and their families, ASPIRES found that children from families with more science related-resources (such as parents with scientific hobbies or careers) were more likely to want to pursue science at school and as a career. The concept of science capital was developed as a way to understand why these science-related resources, attitudes and aspirations led some children to pursue science, while others did not. Science capital was developed conceptually and empirically through the Enterprising Science project and the ASPIRES 2 project. The Enterprising Science project developed a survey to measure science capital and extended the concept of science capital beyond homes and into schools and museums. Science capital is being used to develop strategies for teaching in primary and secondary schools and to develop measures of science capital for adults. ASPIRES ASPIRES, currently based at UCL Institute of Education, is a 10-year longitudinal research project studying young people‚Äôs science and career aspirations. The first ASPIRES study (2009-2013) tracked young people's science and career aspirations from age 10-14. ASPIRES 2 continues to track young people until age 19, to understand the changing influences of the family, school, careers education and social identities and inequalities on young people's science and career aspirations. Key findings include: # Students with low Science Capital are unlikely to see science as ‚Äòfor me‚Äô. In the first phase of our project, we introduced the term Science Capital to refer to someone‚Äôs science-related qualifications, understanding, knowledge (about science and ‚Äòhow it works‚Äô), interest and social contacts (e.g. knowing someone who works in a science-related job). # Enjoyment of Science doesn‚Äôt translate into science aspirations. # Current careers education is not just ‚Äòpatchy‚Äô but patterned, particularly in terms of social inequalities. # The stratification of science at Key Stage 4 may be contributing to the STEM skills gap. # Girls pursuing the physical sciences post-16 are exceptional. This project was first based at King‚Äôs College London, having moved to the UCL Institute of Education in March 2017. It is funded by the Economic and Social Research Council. Science capital in practice Science capital is used across a variety of educational settings to support science learning, particularly for children. For instance, one British school aims to help students to develop science capital through taking part in science clubs, while on a larger scale, the Science Museum Group uses science capital as a concept to inform their strategy and work across all their partner institutions. In Ireland, Science Gallery Dublin aims to increase visitors‚Äô science capital through their exhibitions. Similarly, in the US the Science Museum of Minnesota is working with science capital to combat inequalities in access to, and participation in, science learning. In October 2017 the Science Capital Teaching Approach was launched at the National STEM Learning Centre in York, UK. The approach was co-developed and trialled over four years between Enterprising Science researchers and secondary science teachers in England.

Broome was appointed as the original society's first Secretary, a post he held until 1828. He held posts at various churches in London, Essex, and Kent, and supported an appeal for earthquake relief in Syria. He wrote about animal theology and also about two 17th-century English clergy. He was guarantor for the RSPCA's debts, which led to his financial ruin and in April 1826 he was sent to a debtors' prison. Background Broome was born in early 1779, the son of Thomas and Frances Broome in Sidmouth, Devon.Molly Baer Kramer, \\"Broome, Arthur MacLoughlin [Arthur Eugenius]\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, available to subscribers According to university records, he matriculated from school and enrolled on 31 March 1798 at Balliol College at Oxford University and he graduated with a BA degree in 1801. Also see Oxford Journal, 28 November 1801, p 3. He subsequently was awarded an MA degree.See the entry in The Royal Kalendar: and Court and City Register for England, Scotland, Ireland and the Colonies for the year 1822, (London, 1823), p 268. He applied to the Bishop of London for ordination in the Church of England and on 21 November 1802 was ordained by Bishop Beilby Porteus as a deacon.Clergy of the Church of England Database person ID 116552 Porteus was an evangelical church reformer and a noted anti-slavery campaigner.See Bob Tennant, \\"Sentiment, Politics and Empire: A Study of Beilby Porteus' Anti-Slavery Sermon,\\" in Discourses of Slavery and Abolition: Britain and its Colonies, 1760-1838, eds. B. Carey, M. Ellis and S. Salih (London; New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2004), 2004), 158-174. Broome's association with Porteus no doubt brought him into a network of contacts with similarly minded individuals. After a year's service in the role of a deacon, Broome was then ordained as a priest by Bishop Porteus on 18 December 1803. His first appointment as a priest was to the parish church, St. Peter's Church situated in Roydon, Essex. His next parish appointment was on 7 March 1812 as a licensed curate to serve two churches, both named St. Mary's, in neighbouring villages, Hinxhill and Brook, situated in Kent. On 6 March 1816, he was appointed as a curate to St. Helen's church in Cliffe at Hoo, Kent. Broome remained in Cliffe until he was appointed as a stipendiary curate to St. Mary's Church, Bromley St Leonard's (now called Bromley by Bow) on 23 April 1819. A year later he was appointed as a perpetual curate at this church and he remained in this position until he resigned on 13 February 1824.For each of his parish appointments see Clergy of the Church of England Database Broome was active in serving the Bromley parish and he came into contact with people who were labourers employed in the warehouses of the East India Company. In December 1822, he wrote to the Company's directors seeking their financial support for an additional weekly church service.Margaret Makepeace, (Woodbridge: Boydell Press, 2010), 74. Broome also demonstrated practical care and concern for the victims of a major earthquake that struck Syria (then part of the Ottoman Empire) and in April 1823 preached a sermon for the purpose of raising funds for victim relief.Morning Post, 2 May 1823, p 2 notice of thanks to Broome inserted by W.H. Hyett Marriage Broome was married to Anna Barne Trollope on 1 May 1817 at St. Margaret's Church, Rochester, Kent.See The Kentish Weekly Post 9 May 1817, p 4; The Monthly Magazine, Vol. 43 (1817), p 479 Anna was born on 6 August 1790 in Huntingdon the eldest child born to Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Trollope (1757‚Äì1805) of the Royal Marines and Anna Steel (1771‚Äì1845).England, Births and Baptisms 1538-1975 available to subscribers Her grandfather was Rev. John Trollope, her great-great-grandfather was the third baronet of Casewick, Sir Thomas Trollope and she was an older cousin of the novelist Anthony Trollope.See the genealogical table in Jill Felicity Durey, Trollope and the Church of England (Basingstoke, Hampshire: Palgrave Macmillan, 2002), p xiv. Some years after her birth, her parents and siblings were relocated from Huntingdon to Rochester, Kent close to where Trollope's military unit was stationed, and Lieutenant-Colonel Trollope died suddenly in 1805 in Somerset while en route to his unit.See his obituary in The Gentleman's Magazine, Vol. LXXV, Part 2, 1805 p 775 Anna's brother George Trollope held the rank of Lieutenant in the Royal Navy but died of consumption (tuberculosis) on 4 August 1837.\\"Deaths\\" Leeds Intelligencer, 12 August 1837, p 5. Anna's wider family included several cousins who were ordained clergy in the Church of England.See Jill Felicity Durey, \\"Ecclesiastical Patronage in Trollope's Novels and Victoria's England,\\" The Churchman, Vol. 109, no. 3, (1995) pp 250-269. Broome and his wife Anna had one daughter, Maria Anna Broome.Maria is named as one of several defendants in the case Trollope v. Routledge 1845 T92, see The National Archives. Writing In 1815, Broome compiled a work about two seventeenth century Church of England clergy, Thomas Fuller and Robert South which consisted of selected excerpts from their writings as well as a short biographical profile of Fuller.Rev. Arthur Broome, Selections from the Works of Fuller and South, with Life and Character of Fuller (London, 1815). Two years later, he reissued the text, which was expanded to include a biographical profile on South.Broome, Selections from the Works of Fuller and South (London: Lackington, 1817). The Gentleman's Magazine carried a positive review of Broome's book. Vol. 87 (May 1817) pp 436-437. Broome dedicated this book to the law reformer Basil Montagu who was also a fan of the writings of Fuller and South.See Basil Montagu, Selections from the works of Taylor, Latimer, Hall, Milton, Barrow, South, Brown, Fuller and Bacon (London: William Pickering, 1839) Broome also edited and annotated an important eighteenth century text in animal theology, A Dissertation on the Duty of Mercy and the Sin of Cruelty to Brute Animals (1776), that was written by Rev. Humphrey Primatt .Broome ed. (London: the author, 1831). RSPCA founder The era in which he lived as well as his personal convictions formed the basis of Broome's role as a campaigner on behalf of animal welfare. The eighteenth and nineteenth century intellectual climate in Britain concerning the use of animals is reflected in different schools of thought that developed around theological, philosophical and moral reflections.Further discussion see Rob Boddice, A History of Attitudes and Behaviours Toward Animals in Eighteenth- and Nineteenth-Century Britain: anthropocentrism and the emergence of animals (Lewiston, New York; Queenston, Ontario; Lampeter, Wales: Edwin Mellen Press, 2008). Some clergy of the late eighteenth century expressed the theological view that the maltreatment of animals was sinful, linking this view to biblical passages denouncing cruelty (e.g. Proverbs 12:10; Numbers 22:21-34) and with passages of mercy (Matthew 5:7), as well as on the grounds that non- human creatures have the capacity for feeling pain.On the moral debate over animal pain in England see James Turner, Reckoning with the Beast: Animals, Pain, and Humanity in the Victorian Mind (Baltimore; London: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1980), and Harriet Ritvo, The Animal Estate: The English and Other Creatures in the Victorian Age (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1987), pp. 125-166. Representatives of this view include the eighteenth century preachers John Wesley, Augustus Montagu Toplady, James Granger, and Humphry Primatt. Others, such as Richard Dean, added to the anti- cruelty argument based on reflections about the resurrection of Jesus having a positive effect on the problem of evil in its impact on the creation () and leading to a future resurrection for non-human creatures.Richard Dean, An Essay on the Future Life of Brutes, 2 Vols. (Manchester: J. Harrop, 1767) , At the time when Broome was a youth and then a student at university, there was a moral groundswell that was opposed to bull-baiting and that resulted in an unsuccessful attempt by William Johnstone Pulteney on 18 April 1800 to pass legislation through England's Parliament to ban the practice.See A Letter to the Right Hon. William Windham on his late opposition to the Bill to Prevent Bull-Baiting by an Old Member of Parliament [Sir Richard Hill MP] 2nd Ed (London: W. Stratford, 1800). Also for discussion Kathryn Shevelow, For The Love of Animals: The Rise of the Animal Protection Movement (New York: Henry Holt, 2008), pp 201-222 A subsequent attempt to pass anti-cruelty legislation was led by Lord Erskine (1750-1823) in the House of Lords in 1809 but it was defeated by opponents in the House of Commons.John Hostettler, Thomas Erskine and Trial By Jury (Hook, Hampshire: Waterside Press, 2010), 197-199. Erskine in his speech on behalf of the Bill combined the vocabulary of animal rights and trusteeship with a theological appeal to biblical passages opposing cruelty.Cruelty to Animals: The Speech of Lord Erskine in the House of Peers (London: Richard Phillips, 1809) Broome expressed an interest in promoting the welfare of animals by opposing acts of cruelty through publishing anonymously a sermon in 1801 \\"Unjustifiableness of Cruelty to the Brute Creation.\\"See the brief review and excerpt in The Monthly Review Vol. 36 (1802) p 447. Passages from this sermon were later reproduced in some of Broome's notes to the abridged version of Primatt's book. Broome's interest in creating an organisation to promote animal welfare and oppose cruelty was apparent in a letter of his that was published in The Kaleidoscope on 6 March 1821 that asked for information about the existence of an anti-cruelty organisation that may have been operating in Liverpool.\\"To Correspondents\\" The Kaleidoscope, 6 March 1821 p 288. Also see The Monthly Magazine Vol. 51 April 1, 1821 p 3 Another piece of evidence concerns a notice that appeared in various newspapers and that was signed under the pseudonym \\"Clerus\\": > An Individual who feels for the sufferings of the Brute Species, and > laments, in common with every benevolent mind, the wanton cruelties which > are so frequently committed with impunity on this unoffending part of God's > Creation, earnestly appeals to the Public in their behalf.

Persons whose sentiments accord with those of the > Writer, on this subject, and who are willing to promote the object he > recommends, are requested to address a few lines (free of postage), to > \\"Clerus\\", 25, Ivy-lane, Paternoster-row.\\"See \\"The Brute Species\\". \\"Notice\\" > in Morning Post, 17 February 1821, p 3. Similarly see \\"Cruelty to Animals\\" > The Sporting Magazine, Vol. VIII New Series No. XLIII (April 1821), p 33. > The italics was in the original notice. Kathryn Shevelow has noted that \\"Clerus\\" (Latin word clergy; so too \\"Clericus\\") was most likely Arthur Broome and that as people began submitting correspondence to periodicals expressing alarm about cruelty toward animals that there emerged a consensus on the need for such like-minded persons to collaborate.Shevelow, For The Love of Animals pp 267-268. The creation of voluntary groups that agitated for legal and social reform through the patronage of aristocrats, clergy and parliamentarians was not unusual in Broome's day, particularly in the case of the abolitionist or anti-slavery movement.See M. J. D. Roberts, Making English Morals: Voluntary Association and Moral Reform in England, 1787-1886 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004). After the passage of Richard Martin's anti-cruelty to cattle bill in 1822, Broome attempted to form a Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals that would bring together the patronage of persons who were of social rank and committed to social reforms.Cruel Treatment of Cattle Act 1822 (3 Geo. IV c. 71) Broome did organise and chair a meeting of sympathisers in November 1822 where it was agreed that a Society should be created and at which Broome was named its Secretary.Shevelow, For The Love of Animals, 268; Arthur W. Moss, Valiant Crusade: The History of the RSPCA (London: Cassell, 1961), 22. However, the venture was short-lived and Broome redoubled his efforts two years later with a successful relaunch of the Society. The maltreatment of cattle at the Smithfield Market prompted Elizabeth Heyrick in 1823 to publish anonymously a stinging rebuke to those acting cruelly as well as to what she perceived was an apparent lack of punitive action taken against the perpetrators.Cursory Remarks on the Evil Tendency of Unrestrained Cruelty; particularly that practised in Smithfield Market (London: Harvey and Darton, 1823). Heyrick's short work began with strong words directed at the supporters of Martin's Act for not prosecuting those who abused animals. However she seemed to be unaware that Broome had in 1822 already personally brought to court some individuals against whom charges of cruelty were heard.\\"Inhumanity of a Drover\\" Morning Post, 27 June 1822, p 3 available at British Newspaper Archives He also from his own pocket paid the salary for an inspector to monitor the abuse of animals at the Smithfield Market.Edward G. Fairholme and Wellesley Pain, A Century of Work For Animals: The History of the RSPCA, 1824-1934, (London: John Murray, 1834) p 55. Broome felt financially secure due to his curate's stipend, the income he received from the sale of his book on Fuller and South, as well as due to an indenture agreement that had been reached between his mother-in-law, his wife and himself that was signed in 1819.The indenture's provisions, which allocated to Mr and Mrs Broome the sum of one thousand one hundred and eighty-four pounds, three shillings and four pence, are reproduced in John P. De Gex and John Smale, Reports of Cases decided in the High Court of Chancery by the Right Hon. Sir J. L. Knight Bruce, Vol 1 (London: Sweet, Maxwell, Stevens and Norton, 1849), 662-674. In 1822-1823 he was busy raising funds for the planned anti-cruelty Society through the republication of earlier texts in animal theology.See advertisement for \\"Books Published This Day\\" Morning Chronicle 18 March 1822, p 2 notice of new edition of Primatt's Duty of Mercy and Broome's Selections of Fuller and South. A similar notice appears in Morning Post 18 July 1823 p 2. He resigned as perpetual curate in Bromley in February 1824. It was at Broome's invitation that a number of social reformers gathered on 16 June 1824 at Old Slaughter's Coffee House, London to create a Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.Lewis Gompertz, Fragments in Defence of Animals, and Essays on Morals, Souls and Future State (London: Horsell, 1852), p 174; Fairholme and Pain, A Century of Work p 52. The meeting was chaired by Thomas Fowell Buxton MP (1786-1845) and the resolution to establish the Society was voted on. Among the others who were present as founding members were Sir James Mackintosh MP, Richard Martin, William Wilberforce, Basil Montagu, John Ashley Warre, Rev. George Bonner (1784-1840), Rev. George Avery Hatch (1757-1837), Sir James Graham, John Gilbert Meymott, William Mudford, and Lewis Gompertz.A complete list is recorded in Gompertz, Fragments in Defence of Animals, pp 174-175. Broome was appointed as the Society's first honorary secretary.\\"Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals\\" Morning Post 28 June 1824 p 2. At the inaugural meeting Broome indicated that \\"every method should be resorted to for the purpose of directing the public attention to the subject; that tracts and sermons should be published, to effect a change in the moral feelings of those who had the control of animals.\\"\\"Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals,\\" The Times [London] Thursday 17 June 1824, p 3. He set up an office at The Quadrant, 72 Regent Street, London.See advertisement \\"Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals\\" The London Courier and Evening Gazette, Monday, 11 April 1825, p 1. During his service as the Society's secretary Broome organised the publishing of the Society's prospectus, various pamphlets and books dealing with the problem of cruelty, as well as urging other clergy to preach anti-cruelty sermons.Examples of its advertised services and publications may be seen in \\"Cruelty to Animals\\" York Herald, 30 July 1825, p 1. \\"Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals,\\" Morning Post, 13 June 1825, p 2; and in Objects and Address of the Society For the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals: established in June 1824 (London: William Molineaux, 1829). The first annual anti-cruelty sermon that was preached on behalf of the Society was delivered by Rev Dr James Rudge (1785‚Äì1852) in March 1827 at the Whitechapel Church.Public Ledger and Daily Advertiser, 20 March 1827, p 2 available at British Newspaper Archives. The Rev Thomas Greenwood delivered a sermon on behalf of the Society on 26 September 1829 at the Church of St. Mary Somerset in Upper Thames Street, London based on the theme of being merciful.\\"Cruelty to Animals,\\" Morning Advertiser, 30 September 1829, p 4. Part of the sermon is extracted in The Voice of Humanity no. IV May 15 1831 pp 141-147 The use of an inspector at the Smithfield Market continued as part of the Society's operations. During 1825, Broome prepared for the first annual meeting of the Society which was held at the Crown and Anchor Tavern on 29 June 1825 and the public notice specifically included appropriate accommodation for the presence of women members.See the public notice in Morning Post 24 June 1825 p 1. Also see report of first annual meeting summarised in \\"Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals\\" London Courier, 1 July 1825, p 4. Several women of social standing were listed as patronesses such as the Duchess of Buccleuch, Dowager Marchioness of Salisbury, Dowager Countess Harcourt, Lady Emily Pusey, Lady Eyre and Lady Mackintosh.Gompertz, Fragments in Defence of Animals, p 174. At this meeting Richard Martin contradicted the impression held in public circles that he had founded the Society: \\"I have nothing at all to do with it,\\" he said \\"it is quite a child of Mr Broome's and he has acted the part of a good father to it.\\"\\"The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals,\\" London Courier, 1 July 1825, p 4. Broome also sought that year to develop an anti- vivisection position and requested written advice from several medical practitioners concerning the efficacy of surgical or laboratory experiments on animals and received letters that did not support vivisection.\\"Cruelty to Animals\\" Morning Post, 10 November 1825, p 1. Unfortunately for Broome, he was the guarantor for the Society's debts. When the debts exceeded the Society's revenue he was held liable in April 1826 and was sentenced in a hearing at the King's Bench to serve time in the debtors' prison.See The National Archives, King's Bench Prison commitments, 1826, Ref. No. PRIS 4/38, 54; and King's Bench Prison, Final Discharges 1827, Ref. No. PRIS 7/46, II. By June 1826, he was free from the prison as his colleagues Richard Martin and Lewis Gompertz raised funds to cover the unpaid debts.See Kramer, \\"Broome, Arthur MacLoughlin [Arthur Eugenius]\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Also see Moss, Valiant Crusade, pp 25-26. The Society's activities were reduced as the raising of revenue became a primary concern.Gompertz, Fragments in Defence of Animals, pp 175-176. In 1827 Broome sought to galvanize interest in the Society's work by proposing an annual lecture opposing cruelty in Liverpool.\\"Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals\\" Liverpool Mercury 2 February 1827, p 8 available at British Newspaper Archives By March 1828, Broome was replaced as the Society's secretary largely owing to his family circumstances and his loss of income.Fairholme and Pain, A Century of Work, p 63. He remained a member and attended some committee meetings from 1828 through to 1832. At a committee meeting on 13 January 1832, Broome was reappointed as a committee member.Report of an Extra Meeting of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals January 13, 1832, p 5. Decline and death Broome's experience of bankruptcy had a serious impact on his wife Anna and their daughter, which appears to have resulted in the couple living apart. Anna's mother and sister Frances moved from England to France in late 1833 and it is possibly the case that Anna and her daughter joined them.Anna's mother died 16 September 1845 in Dinan, Bretagne, France, and her estate was the subject of a case in the London Court of Chancery in 1847, Trollope v. Routledge, see The Jurist, Vol. XI-Part 1 (London: S. Sweet, 1848), pp 1002-1005. The settling of this case affected each of the estate beneficiaries including Anna Barne Broome (nee Trollope). Her sister Frances Trollope died on 29 February 1872 in Caen, France, and her deceased estate was administered in November 1876 see England & Wales, National Probate Calendar (Index of Wills and Administrations), 1861-1941 (1876), p 503. Evidence for the harm caused by Broome's bankruptcy is apparent in the wording of the last will and testament of Anna's sister Frances Trollope dated 12 November 1833, in which Anna is named as a substitute beneficiary to a life-interest \\"for her sole and separate use and not be subject to the control of her present or any future husband.\\"Last Will and Testament of Frances Trollope 12 November 1833 available by subscription In January 1834 Broome was distressed to the point where one evening he was found inebriated and rolling in mud in York Street, Westminster by a police officer.Reported in several newspaper accounts including \\"Queen Square\\" Morning Chronicle 22 January 1834 p 4; \\"Queen Square\\" Evening Mail 22 January 1834 p 7;Chelmsford Chronicle 24 January 1834 p 2; \\"London Police\\" Bucks Gazette, 25 January 1834 p 3.

Ryder, Animal Revolution: Changing Attitudes Towards Speciesism Rev Ed (Oxford; New York: Berg, 2000), p 88. John Lawrence (1753-1839), an early advocate of animal rights, described Broome as the Society's \\"humane and zealous founder.\\"John Lawrence, The Horse in All His Varieties and Uses (London: M. Arnold, 1829), p 304. Five years before his death The London Literary Gazette drew attention to a fresh release of Broome's edited book (abridging Primatt) The Duty of Humanity to Inferior Creatures, and paid him this kind tribute: > Mr. Broome is the founder of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to > Animals; the very establishment is a proof of, and honour to, the advance of > civilisation. Any thing from so earnest a friend of so good a cause must be > acceptable.See \\"Clearing Off Arrears\\" The London Literary Gazette and > Journal of the Belles Lettres, No. 832, Saturday, 29 December 1832, p 823.

The court held that because the right of action was vested in the liquidator (rather than the company itself) then those claims were not claims for realising or getting in the assets of the company, and therefore were not expenses of the liquidation. Accordingly they were not recoverable under the preferential regime reserved for expenses of the liquidation. The court also gave useful guidance in the discussion of the proper application and context of applications by liquidators in relation to preferences and claims relating to wrongful trading. Facts MC Bacon Ltd was an importer of bacon which went into insolvent liquidation. Before going into liquidation the company had granted a debenture containing a floating charge in favour of its bank. At the time the company was already insolvent. The liquidator brought proceedings claiming that the debenture was either a voidable preference or a transaction at an undervalue. It also brought a wrongful trading claim against the bank as a shadow director, but that claim was abandoned during the course of trial.[1991] Ch 127, 133G-H The bank had applied to have the entire claim struck out as disclosing no reasonable cause of action. That strike out application came before Knox J. He declined to strike out the claim, and it proceeded to trial before Millet J. The hearing before Millet J lasted 17 days who dismissed all of the liquidator's claims. That decision was separately reported as Re MC Bacon Ltd (No 1) [1990] BCC 78. The liquidator then sought an order for his costs. He accepted that he had lost the case, but he contended that the action had been properly brought (evidenced not least by the fact that it had survived a claim to strike it out). Accordingly he argued that he was entitled to have his costs paid out of the assets subject to the floating charge under the Insolvency Act 1986 under section 115 or section 175(2)(a). The liquidator relied heavily upon Re Barleycorn Enterprises Ltd [1970] Ch 465 (now overruled). Judgment Millett J recounted the history of the litigation. He noted that the liquidator claimed those costs not as a matter of discretion, but as of right. In Re Barleycorn Enterprises Ltd it was held that assets subject to a floating charge were assets of the company for the purposes of determining the liquidator's right to be reimbursed their expense.This decision was subsequently overruled in , but the rule of law was then effectively reinstated by an amendment to the Insolvency Act 1986 to introduce section 176ZA. =Primary issues= The court proceeded on the assumption that the claims were properly brought, although it noted that this was a slightly shaky assumption. Although the claims had survived a strike-out and an application for indemnity costs, the claims had failed, and a key part had been abandoned midway through trial. Millett J noted in particular that the undervalue claim was doomed from the very outset. The crucial part of the judgment was whether the proceedings could properly be called \\"expenses of the winding up\\". The court noted that under rule 4.218(1) of the Insolvency Rules 1986 legal costs and expenses will be expenses of the winding up if they are \\"expenses properly chargeable or incurred by ... the liquidator in preserving, realising or getting in any of the assets of the company.\\"[1991] Ch 127, 136D However, in the instant case, the court held: = Obiter dictum= Although that was sufficient to dispose of the application, the court went on to consider the nature of the remedies open to the liquidator, and handed down the obiter dictum for which the case is best known. The court noted that any sums recovered by the liquidator by way of unfair preference is not owned by the company and is not caught as after acquired property by the floating charge. Instead it is held by the liquidator on statutory trusts for the unsecured creditors, see Re Yagerphone Ltd [1935] Ch 392. Millett J further considered whether or not Re Barleycorn Enterprises Ltd was correct to hold that assets which are subject to a floating charge should be treated as assets available to the liquidator in relation to expense claims. He expressed significant reservations as to the correctness of that position.[1991] Ch 127, 138B This would essentially presage a later decision of the House of Lords where, sitting as Lord Millett, he would overrule Re Barleycorn. Significance The decision was cited with approval and followed by the Court of Appeal in Re Oasis Merchandising Services Ltd [1998] Ch 170. The doubts expressed by Millett J about Re Barleycorn would be reinforced when he sat as part of the court that overruled it in . The decision was also followed by the Court of Appeal in Re Floor Fourteen [2001] 3 All ER 499. However following that decision the position was reversed in part by statute, and where the creditors committee sanctions the legal proceedings, those will be treated as expenses in the winding up.Insolvency Act 1986, Schedule 4, part I, paragraph 3, as inserted by the Enterprise Act 2002, section 253.

It became prominent in the cultural panorama of the 1930s. Historical context In 1937, after two mandates by Arturo Alessandri Palma, the Popular Front took over the Chilean government. The international situation was critical, marked by the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì1939) and by the imminent outbreak of World War II (1939‚Äì1945). This affected conditions for the majority of the population. Economic context Chile was undergoing a process of economic transition, as its main source of livelihood was the agricultural sector, but interest in industrialization was growing. This had dire consequences for the mining sector, as production of saltpeter ceased, and consequently many unemployed northern miners decided to travel to the capital in search of new job opportunities. Characteristics of the group Due to the great social turmoil resulting from the global crisis, some young Chilean writers felt the need to reflect what they saw around them in their works. In particular they detailed the deplorable conditions in which miners and laborers worked, and how this situation extended to their families ‚Äì because the jobs paid poorly, scarcity and misery were common in daily life. Facing this great social problem, various writers and artists wanted to bring literature and the arts closer to the reality of the Chilean working and middle classes. In the Generation of '38, interest in social issues was united with the idea of creating an intellectual and artistic movement. This contrasted with earlier years in which culture was not a transcendent part of Chilean social life because literature and other forms of art did not reflect the reality of life in the country. The Generation of '38 was not only a literary movement, but also extended to other areas of culture. During the 1940s the experimental theater of the University of Chile and the Symphony Orchestra were created. In this way, both theater and music ensured that interest in the social question transcended the literary sphere and became a relevant theme for Chilean culture of the time. An example of the themes that were addressed in the literature of the time is the narrative of Nicomedes Guzm√°n (1914‚Äì1964) in his work Los hombres oscuros, where he alludes to the vicissitudes of a man living in a tenement and how he decides to become part of a trade union movement. The type of literature that Guzm√°n created was that of a \\"pamphleteer\\" character, since in his works there was an implicit call to workers to mobilize and organize themselves to promote awareness of their problems and jointly seek certain improvements. Another author who was interested in social problems was Volodia Teitelboim (1916‚Äì2008), whose works portrayed how capitalism affects the poor conditions in which poor and middle class Chileans live. This is how she referred to the birth of the Generation of '38: The novelist Carlos Droguett (1912‚Äì1996) tells in one of his chronicles of the deaths of some young people who participated in a protest in the Seguro Obrero building in 1938. In his 1966 autobiography he affirmed: \\"Seguro Obrero shook me deeply and made me aware of my capacity to hate.\\" In short, many of the works created by writers belonging to the Generation of '38 were tools to express their discontent with the working conditions and misery experienced by most Chileans.

Petliura's fault? by Henry Abramson, Ukrayinska Pravda (25 February 2019) Before joining the Ukrainian Army, Samsonenko served in the Russian Imperial Army, holding a rank of praporshchik. In 1917 he joined the newly formed Ukrainian detachment of the Russian Republic, the 2nd Ukrainian Cossack Regiment of Hetman Polubotok. In November 1918, in Lubny, he gathered a guerilla detachment in a fight against the Hetman administration. In January 1919 his detachment moved to the Right- bank Ukraine, where it was transformed in the \\"Zaporizhian Brigade named after Symon Petlura\\" which consisted of two kurins (battalions). After suffering a defeat at frontlines in March 1919, remnants of the brigade in May 1919 were transferred to the Zaporizhian Corpus of the Standing Army of the Ukrainian People's Republic (Ukrainian People's Army). On 1 May 1919 Samosenko was arrested and was under investigation on charges of organizing Jewish pogroms. In October 1919 he was freed from jail in Kamianets-Podilskyi by military detachments of the Armed Forces of South Russia that occupied the city. On 17 January 1920 Samosenko was a military commissar and commander of the Red Insurgent Forces of Bratslav County. In April 1920 he joined the 2nd Division (later the 3rd Iron Division) of Ukrainian People's Army, but soon it was discovered that he was under investigation.

Mones specializes in representing victims of child sexual abuse against institutions like the Boy Scouts of America and the Catholic Church. He has also defended children accused of parricide. He is the author of the books When a Child Kills: Abused Children Who Kill Their Parents and Stalking Justice: The Dramatic True Story of the Detective Who First Used DNA Testing to Catch a Serial Killer. Early life Paul Mones received his BA from the State University of New York at Buffalo and completed his JD at the University of North Carolina Law School. After law school he became a staff lawyer for West Virginia Legal Services. He eventually became the director of a juvenile justice program in Morgantown, West Virginia. He has practiced law in Portland, Oregon and currently practices in Los Angeles. Legal career During the 1980s and 1990s, Mones was described as the only lawyer in the United States specializing on the defense of sexually abused and physically abused children accused of killing their parents. Between 1981 and 1993, Mones defended or acted as a consultant on more than two hundred parricide cases. Mones‚Äô advocacy work also extended to developing public service announcements about child abuse with organizations like the NBA. In 2010 in Portland, Oregon, Mones won a $19.9 million verdict against the Boy Scouts of America filed by a former scout who had been sexually abused by his Scout leader in the mid- 1980s. This verdict resulted in the release of the Perversion Files that had been maintained by the Boy Scouts for about ninety years. The files, which were released for the period 1965 through 1985, detailed the sexual abuse of scouts by their adult leaders. The case was a part of Mones‚Äô current practice representing victims of child sexual abuse against trusted authority figures in public and religious organizations. Mones has also been quoted as an expert on child's rights advocacy and sexual abuse cases. Interviews with Mones about his work have appeared in segments for television news shows such as CNN, Frontlines, Oprah, 60 Minutes, and 20/20. Writing In 1985, Mones authored the study The Relationship Between Parricide and Child Abuse: An Overview, on the relationship between parricide and child abuse. In his work, Mones argued that his case studies that the primary reason teens killed their parents was because they believed no one would help end their abuse, and that the abuse was likely to escalate into their own demise. In 1991 Mones authored the book When a Child Kills: Abused Children Who Kill Their Parents (Pocket Books: ). In his book he claimed that most American runaway children leave home to escape parental abuse, and that most of the cases of children killing their parents in the US are the result of child abuse. Mones also wrote of cases in which sexually abused children would deny the abuse even after the homicide because of shame and embarrassment. In 1996, Mones wrote Stalking Justice: The Dramatic True Story of the Detective Who First Used DNA Testing to Catch a Serial Killer (Pocket Books: ), a true crime story concerning the first time DNA was used in rape-murder case in the United States. Kirkus Reviews wrote of the book that, \\"Mones brings to his story gritty, specific descriptions of high-tech forensics that will fascinate true-crime buffs and mystery fans alike. Novelistic suspense, strong characterization, plus state-of- the-art crime-solving add up to a natural for summer reading lists.\\" Mones has also been a contributor to periodicals including The Huffington Post and the American Bar Association Journal. Recognition In 1993 Mones received the Livingston Hall Juvenile Justice Award from the American Bar Association.

An ASME committee made the following outline of Mr. Carlson's achievements relative to the production of these casings: 15 inch high-explosive howitzer shells, circa 1917 :\\"A booster consisting of a booster casing, charge of high explosive, and a fuse socket, is one of the components essential to the proper functioning of a high-explosive shell at the target. The production of boosters is dependent upon the booster casing, a component entirely new to the manufacturers of this country and even to the Ordnance Department before the war.\\" :\\"For many years before the war and throughout its duration the French used in their 75-mm. gun a shell having a tapered booster casing made by hot-drawing a short round billet, until the approximate shape was obtained, and then either finish- forming in process, or machining it to the exact shape.\\"ASME. \\"Recommends Hjalmar G.

And more specific about Carlson invented a process of cold-drawing, and his role in selling it to the US Ordnance Department: Basic drawing process for a wire, bar or tube. :\\"About a year before the war Mr. Carlson invented a process of cold-drawing, without subsequent machining, the French type of booster casing from ‚Äúdead soft, deep drawing‚Äù sheet steel. Soon after the United States entered the war, in a talk with the officer in charge of the design and production of artillery ammunition, he found that the French type of shell and components had been decided upon, but that the design of the booster casing had been modified by doing away with the taper on its outside because of its being too difficult to permit of manufacture in large quantities, and substituting for it a straight cylindrical surface. Furthermore, Mr. Carlson found that the Department, having been advised by competent manufacturers that even the straight-sided booster casing could not be drawn from the flat sheet, owing to its enlarged threaded end, had fully decided to machine all casings from the solid bar in automatic screw machines. The Department was prepared to pay 14 cents each for these casings so made.\\" :\\"Mr. Carlson convinced the officials of the Ordnance Department that their substitute design for the French type could and should be cold-drawn from flat stock rather than machined from bars in automatic screw machines, and also that the exact French tapered model could also be thus reproduced.\\" The method developed by Carlson was further perfected for practical manufacture, as the ASME committee further explained: :\\"The Rockwood Sprinkler Company, Worcester, Mass., of which Mr. Carlson was general superintendent, contracted to make these casings for the Ordnance Department. Mr. Carlson made a series of inventions to perfect his method of manufacture and make it entirely practical and organized a new manufacturing department which made over twenty million casings. Due to the large saving in material and in plant cost and expense of operation, the Rockwood Company was able to produce the casings at a much lower price than that first estimated, delivered them several weeks ahead of the contract time of delivery, and did much in helping other government contractors to fill their contracts.\\" The 20,000,000 steel booster casings had been used as component of 75-mm high-explosive shells in World War I, but also in bombs, gas shells and other munitions.Worcester Polytechnic Institute (1925), The Journal.

Most of Hurston's work involved her \\"Negro\\" characterization that were so true to reality, that she was known as an excellent anthropologist, \\"As an anthropologist and as an African- American writer during the Harlem Renaissance, Hurston was uniquely situated to explore the critical possibilities of marginality.\\" Coming from an all- black community in Eatonville, Florida, she lived comfortably due to her father holding high titles, John Hurston was a local Baptist preacher and the mayor of Eatonville. After the death of her mother in 1904, at the age of thirteen, Hurston was forced to live with relatives in Jacksonville who worked as domestic servants. In her essay Hurston references Jacksonville where she describes that she felt \\"thrown against a sharp white background\\". Eatonville and Jacksonville became the main influential settings for her essay \\"How it Feels To Be Colored Me\\" and her novel Their Eyes Were Watching God. In both writings Hurston begins to investigate the true meaning of individuality and personality, through the usage of anecdotes, imagery, tone, and figurative language. Hurston's writings allow the reader to understand \\"personal expression to the arena of public discourse without losing the ties to their home cultures and languages\\"  Summary  Downtown Jacksonville in 1914 Hurston begins the essay about her childhood in the town of Eatonville, Florida. She describes watching white people from her front porch, and dances and sings for them in return for money. Hurston becomes comfortable with her surroundings in the small town of Eatonville. At the age of thirteen her mother passes away and Hurston was sent away to leave her home in Jacksonville to attend a boarding school. At this point, Hurston is referred to as just another ‚Äúcolored girl.‚Äù She then elaborates how Eatonville was a safe zone for her since it was considered a ‚Äúcolored town‚Äù(358). As time progressed, she realized the differences between herself and others surrounding her, like her skin and the different personalities in her friends. She begins to feel a sense of isolation and loneliness. Although, Hurston claims that she does not consider herself \\"tragically colored\\" but a regular human being, \\"At times I have no race, I am just me\\"(359). She mentions her experience at a jazz club with a white friend, where through the music she expresses the racial differences and distance between their lives. She concludes her essay acknowledging the difference but refuses the idea of separation. \\"I have no separate feeling about being an American citizen and colored\\" (360). She explains that if the racial roles were reversed, and blacks discriminated against whites, the outcome is the same for a white person‚Äôs experience amongst black people. In her final paragraph, she compares herself to a brown paper bag filled with random bits, just as everyone around her is a different colored paper bag filled with different small bits and pieces that make each unique. Hurston concludes that every race is essential and special to the \\"Great Stuffer of Bags\\". She encourages one not to focus on race, but one‚Äôs self-awareness and the similarities we all have in common.

Naumburg Cathedral and the landscpae has been proposed by Germany for inscription in the List of World Heritage. On July 1, 2018, only Naumburg Cathedral was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site. The landscape around the World Heritage nomination \\"Naumburg Cathedral\\" is representative for processes at the High Middle Ages that shaped the whole continent: Christianization, settlement and cultivation processes, the so- called Landesausbau, that took place between 1000 and 1300. This borderland region also bears witness of the intercultural exchange of different cultures in the High Middle Ages. The highest-ranking buildings and works of art, most of all Naumburg Cathedral with its globally unique artistic and iconographic founder figures, provides testimony to the claims to power and the self- confidence of the worldly and spiritual rulers as well as to the region's crucial role as a place of interchange between Western and Eastern realms.  Nomination as World Heritage  Steinmeister vineyard In 1998, Naumburg Cathedral was inscribed into the Tentative List for World Heritage nominations and extended seven years later by its surrounding cultural landscape.Tentative Lists are prepared by States Parties to the Convention on the Protection of Cultural and Natural World Heritage. They contain a number of nomination proposals to be submitted in the future. For further information on the selection of potential World Heritage sites, please see selection criteria. ‚Ä≥The ‚Ä≤Naumburg Cathedral and the surrounding cultural landscape along the rivers Saale and Unstrut‚Ä≤ are outstanding and representative examples of the High Middle Ages (1000‚Äì1300). Nowhere else in the world has such a high density of monuments and cultural landscape elements from the High Middle Ages been preserved in such a small space in such a level of authenticity in its original spatial setting.‚Ä≥.Prof. Dr. Jeffrey Hamburger, Harvard University, Prof. Dr. Dany Sandron, Universit√© de Paris-Sorbonne, Prof. Dr. Stefan Tebruck, Justus-Liebig-Universit√§t Gie√üen a.o.(2017). In 2008, the F√∂rderverein Welterbe an Saale und Unstrut e.V. was founded as the Sponsoring Association of the World Heritage Site by the Saale and Unstrut. The nomination was discussed on the 39th meeting of World Heritage Committee.UNESCO (2015): WHC-15/39.COM/INF.19. The World Heritage Committee decided to defer the nomination in order to allow for a revision and renewed submission taking into account the recommendations of the ICOMOS-evaluation and seeking the guidance and advice by ICOMOS in the process.UNESCO (2015): WHC-15/39.COM/19. On 1 February 2016, Germany submitted a renewed submission to the World Heritage Centre in Paris, UNESCO.UNESCO (2017): WHC/17/41.COM/INF.8B1. This nomination was discussed at the 41st meeting of the World Heritage Committee in Krak√≥w, Poland, from 2 until 12 July 2017 where the Committee decided upon the Outstanding Universal Value of the Naumburg Cathedral. Germany submitted the revised nomination \\"Naumburg Cathedral\\" on 1 February 2018. However, only Naumburg Cathedral was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site on July 1, 2018. The German officials were indifferent about the decision of excluding the surrounding landscape. = Cultural landscape = The cultural landscape around the Naumburg Cathedral is a cultural landscape that illustrates the \\"evolution of human society and settlement over time\\".UNESCO (2016): WHC.16/01. This landscape was created intentionally by man. The Naumburg Cathedral and the High Medieval Cultural Landscape of the Rivers Saale and Unstrut displays the rise of the Central Middle Ages in Europe. This was a time of rise, a ‚Ä≥take off‚Ä≥ due to an increase in population, Christianization and major transformation in agriculture. The ‚Ä≥Landesausbau‚Ä≥, urban development, internal colonization and territorialisation, took place all across Europe. ‚Ä≥Never again has Europe seen such cultural and institutional uniformity as at that time‚Ä≥. The nominated area serves as an extraordinary model region due to the density and quality of elements displaying mediaeval land development and land exploitation. It was a melting pot of populations of different origins, Frankish, Thuringian, Saxon, Flemish, and Slavonic. Furthermore, as a sensitive border region, it was shaped by ecclesiastical and secular powers seeking the rights of possession, representation and defense. In the nominated landscape, 720 elements from the period of the Central Middle Ages are still in use, establish the identity of the region and give testimony of the shaping of border lands during a period of no more than 200 years in the High Middle Ages, which has in this instance been tangibly preserved to present day.  Description of the cultural landscape  The landscape is characterized by authentic monuments, intact urban morphology and unchanged rural landscape from the High Middle Ages visible in Naumburg and Freyburg, around the villages of Ebersroda, Schleberoda, Gross-Wilsdorf and Flemmingen, as well as the vineyards of Dechantenberg, Schweigenberg, K√∂ppelberg, and Saalh√§user. In total, four castles and four monastic complexes, two cities as well as villages, vineyards, fertile fields and pastures constitute this nomination.UNESCO (2017): WHC/17/41.COM/INF.8B1. They form a serial nomination with a total of 11 components parts : Landscape around Neuenburg # Naumburg # Sch√∂nburg # Goseck # Freyburg # Schleberoda # Ebersroda # R√∂del # Kleinjena # Pforta # Saaleck # Flemmingen The nominated property is surrounded by a buffer zone ensuring the protection of relevant view axes and topographical characteristics as well as the integrity of the property. = Component: Naumburg =  Naumburg Cathedral  Naumburg Cathedral is known for its architecture, sculptures and images: ‚Ä≥The harmonic connection between architecture, sculpture and stained glass windows in the west choir of the cathedral counts among the most impressive creations of human creativity in the Middle Ages at large.‚Ä≥Prof. Dr. Jeffrey Hamburger, Harvard University, Prof. Dr. Dany Sandron, Universit√© de Paris-Sorbonne, Prof. Dr. Stefan Tebruck, Justus-Liebig-Universit√§t Gie√üen a.o. (2017). The Romanesque core structure is flanked by two Gothic choirs in the east and in the west, built in the transitional style between Late Romanesque and Early Gothic. = The Naumburg Masters = Naumburg Masters The worldwide known workshop of sculptors and stonemasons, which was likely established in the early 13th century, known as the Naumburg Masters, was headed by a sculptor- architect, who has been described by scholars as ‚Ä≥an artist of real genius‚Ä≥. The quality of the work of the Naumburg Masters, marked by an extraordinary realism and individualism of sculptures and a detailed representation of the environment such as plants or ornaments, has justified Naumburg's reputation beyond its region. The Naumburg Masters were conveyors and pioneers of the innovations in architecture and sculpture of the Late Hohenstaufen period in the 13th century. Their building workshop has left traces of its work all the way from Northern France over the Middle Rhine area up to the eastern boundaries of the German Empire and further on the southwestern Europe. It reflects the cultural artistic exchange during the High Middle Ages. = Choir screens ‚Äì Passion of Christ = West choir One feature of the Naumburg Cathedral is its two almost completely preserved choir screen structures from the 13th century. In the east choir, the only late Romanesque hall choir screen has survived. In the west choir, there is a Gothic partition-type screen: ‚Ä≥Even within the tiny corpus of medieval churches whose original configurations of architecture and sculpture remain intact, the arrangement at Naumburg is unique.‚Ä≥ The western mural choir screen shows artistic quality in terms of architecture, ornamentation and figural sculptures: ‚Ä≥The mid-thirteenth- century west choir of Naumburg Cathedral has long been admired both for its unified architectural design‚Ä≥.‚Ä≥ The architecture has an organic character and provides information details such as historic local plants. The conceptually sophisticated arrangement of the passion of Christ is one of the most outstanding among the preserved sculptural ensembles from the 13th century, providing i.a. detailed information on contemporary clothing. The Naumburg Master achieved a degree of dramatic expressiveness and natural vibrancy that conveys the suffering of Christ and the deep grief of Mary and St. John. The statues of the mourning Mary and St. John catch the viewers attention and draw them close to Christ. = Founder statues ‚Äì Uta = Uta von Ballenstedt statue, located in the west choir of the Naumburg Cathedral Founder figures Hermann und Reglindis The Early Gothic west choir was built with an elevated gallery portraying the founders. The life-sized representation of a group of 12 people of the high nobility that were neither emperor neither king is unique in art history : ‚Ä≥The twelve founder statues [...] are extraordinary in many aspects. A series of monumental representations of secular male and female founders of the cathedral of Naumburg, the statues are characterized by startling vividness and by theatrical interaction‚Ä≥. The statues are considered ‚Ä≥sculptural ensemble of the major arts‚Ä≥ due to their expressiveness and to the individualized portraits. There cannot be found comparable examples from the same period. Founder figures Ekkehard und Uta One founder couple, Ekkehard II, Margrave of Meissen, with his wife Uta von Ballenstedt, stands in the north. Margravess Uta is presented like a queen with a fleur-de-lis crown. The sculpture of Uta has experienced an unparalleled cult, due considerably to photographs taken by the Naumburger photographer Walter Hege in the 1920s. Umberto Eco wrote in his ‚Ä≥History of Beauty‚Ä≥ that from all women of art history, the one he would like most have dinner with was in first place, ahead of all others, Uta von Naumburg. The founder figure of Uta also found her way in the UFA motion pictures and as the Queen of Disney's Snow White, causing a huge wave of enthusiasm for this icon of gothic art. = Glass painting = West choir Naumburg The window paintings of the west choir were created from an unknown glass painting workshop in close consultation with the building workshop of the Naumburg Master, together creating unity and harmony. This becomes evident by the designs of the images of the saints that correspond with the founders‚Äô sculptures in many aspects like positions, gestures and weapons. The portrayal of ten bishops of Naumburg at the bottom of the window rows creates the impression as if the statues of the founders were standing on the same level as the medals. The glass paintings count among the most significant glass paintings of their style from the 13th century. = Old Town of Naumburg = Old city of Naumburg Naumburg was a bishop's seat and an important market place founded at the beginning of the 11th century on the place of the former Slav fortress of Wethau. The development of the town is closely connected with one of the most powerful and noble Ekkehardine dynasty of that time, Emperor Conrad II and Bishop Hildeward of Zeitz. With the consent of the pope John XIX and the emperor Konrad II, as well as citing the danger of Slav incursions, margrave Ekkerhard I relocated the Episcopal See of Zeitz to Naumburg. Along with the bishop's seat he transferred his own family seat from Kleinjena to their own estate at the new castle ‚Ä≥Nuwemburch‚Ä≥ in Naumburg around 1028. Furthermore, he assigned the protection of the See to the ‚Ä≥new castle‚Ä≥, an event hitherto unparalleled in the history of the empire. This bold move enabled the construction of the first early Romanesque cathedral in Naumburg. Certificate Naumburg In 1033, another highly unusual event for this time took place: On the initiative of the bishop Kadeloh of Memleben, Emperor Conrad II granted the merchants of Kleinjena, who moved to Naumburg free trade and the heritable, interest-free ownership of their enclosed domicile. It is the earliest dated written document from 13 July 1033, that marked the Nuvemburg to the powerful market and merchant settlement in Naumburg. Margraves Ekkehard II and Hermann also established two monasteries, the Benedictine Monastery of St. George and the St Moritz Monastery. When the Ekkehardine dynasty died out by 1046, the bishops became the rulers of the town. By that time, Naumburg had already developed into a political, economic and religious center for the entirety of this border region. The trade routes in the region were relocated to Naumburg, which was strategically situated at the crossing of the Via Regia and the Regensburg Road. Nowadays, the roads as well as parcel structures reflect the structure of the medieval civil town. The earliest stone buildings in Naumburg are situated in the cathedral precincts with the oldest residential tower of Naumburg with two Romanesque floors constructed probably in the mid-12th century at the cathedral precincts. = Component: Freyburg = Church of Freyburg The old town of Freyburg is situated 9 kilometers north of Naumburg on the left bank of the Unstrut River. This component contains Neuenburg Castle above the river valley. The Schweigenberg vineyard stretches along the slopes towards Zscheiplitz Monastery.  Neuenburg Castle  Neuenburg Chapel Around 1090, it was most probably Louis the Springer who built the vast and impressive complex of Neuenburg Castle. Situated in the border region, this fortified castle served military purposes and reflected ambitions, self- confidence and sophistication of the Ludowingians. Already in 1100, Neuenburg Castle was the largest and most important fortification in central Germany and remained of outstanding political and military significance until the 13th century. It was designed as a border castle for the powerful Ludowinger dynasty and was part of a network of the landgraves‚Äô castles, which also included Wartburg Castle. Neuenburg at night Built around 1090, Neuenburg Castle was extended and modernized on a large scale several times. With its 30 000 square meters, the castle was amongst the strongest architectural representations of military power in all of the empire. It has survived to a remarkable extend: Major sections of the curtain walls in the north and east, part of the gate, the bottom part of the castle, the castle keep, trenches in the east and in the south are conserved until today. The landmark big William (Dicker Wilhelm) is situated in the north-eastern part of the complex and visible from far away as a symbol of power. The castle keep III is classified as an independent development next to the similar residential towers (donjons) in the Rhineland region. Around 1225, a residential tower (residential tower II) was built probably for the landgrave's family outside the southern curtain wall. 1172 Emperor Friedrich I Barbarossa visited Neuenburg Castle ‚Äì the legend of the ‚Äúliving wall‚Äù of soldiers providing the best military defense has its roots in this legendary visit. Residence building at Neuenburg The court culture of the Count Palatine at Neuenburg Castle was an extremely important center of literary activities in the Empire at the end of the 12th and beginning of the 13th century. The most important poets of the 13th century, namely Wolfram von Eschenbach and Walther von der Vogelweide stayed at Neuenburg Castle. Heinrich von Weldecke completed here the Eneas novel which was the foundation of the German language secular epic. ‚Ä≥When Veldeke was called to the court of Thuringia [..], he joined the entourage of a great patron and became the esteemed center of the most important literary circle that existed in Germany at the time‚Ä≥. Neuenburg view The Double Chapel of Neuenburg was developed around 1220 and is one of the best preserved Romanesque buildings of Neuenburg Castle. In terms of its architectural shapes and structural ornamentation, it is a unique achievement by combining the Saxon tradition with the then latest developments in art which emerged in the Rhineland region. The upper floor of the Double Chapel is a landmark of art because of the play of colors of the black column shafts made of carboniferous limestone, which came from the Northern French and Belgian region of the Ardennes, 500 kilometers away with the multi-coloured structural ornamentation. The polyglobed arches on the underside of the transverse arches are an example for the influences from the Morish part of Spain transmitted by Rhenanian Art. They are the only example of this form of ornament to the east of the Rhine and thus represent a unique item in architectural history.  Old town of Freyburg  Neuenburg view from Freyburg In the last quarter of the 12th, Herman I from the Ludowinger dynasty founded the town of Freyburg. The town was built at the food of Neuenburg Castle around a rectangular market place to meet the demands of the increased population, to provide the Neuenburg Castle with merchandise and to secure the passage and revenues of the Unstrut River. The landgraves of Thuringia controlled the road in the valley by erecting this fortified town. The determinative ‚Ä≥frey‚Ä≥ (free) referred to the royal freedom granted to it when it was founded and to the baronial privilege of a nearly royal rank, which primarily reveals the self-image of its rulers. The unity of Neuenburg castle and the town of Freyburg is a typical feature of the policy of power of the Ludowingers. The landgraves were not directly present in the town but resided in Neuenburg Castle. Landgrove Ludwig IV and his wife, the later Saint Elizabeth of Hungary, built the town parish church of St Mary's to emphasize the baronial need for representation. The capital ornamentation in the entrance area with its diamond-shaped net and the Romanesque sculpting of the compact tympanum is of outstanding quality in the way of the curves of the bodies and the graphic lines of the figures were sculptured. Freyburg's regular layout is a grid of roads crossing each other in right angles, a distinct transverse axis and its nearly exact subdivision in blocks. After the extinction of the Ludowinger dynasty in 1247, the city lost its significance but continued its viticulture for which it is still known in the Saale-Unstrut region today.  Zscheiplitz Monastery  Church in Zscheiplitz The Benedictine convent of nuns, the Zscheiplitz Monastery, was first mentioned in 1203 and is situated two kilometers west of Freyburg. The name of Zscheiplitz has its roots in the Slavic name ‚Ä≥ciplic‚Ä≥ (small). Around 1085, after the murder of landgrave Friedrich III, his widow Adelheid donated the estate of Zscheiplitz to the church. It was then turned into a Benedictine monastery. Zscheiplitz view The church of Zscheiplitz was built as a one-nave church in the 12th century and extended by a gallery to the west and in the north during the 13th century.  Vineyard of Schweigenberg  The vineyard of Schweigenberg is located west of Freyburg and was probably created by citizens of Freyburg upon the initiative of the landgraves of Thuringia and / or the monasteries of Goseck and Zscheiplitz in the 13th century. It benefitted from favorable climatic conditions and agrarian innovations for a diversified subsistence economy in the region. This vineyard is still recognized in Germany as a prime example of terraced winegrowing by way of hoe-farming as a monument of this traditional form of cultivation. = Component: Pforta = Pforta from air The monastery of Pforta was created by the Cistercian Order. The premises include functional buildings, the Romanesque House (grange), the Kleine Saale canal, as well as the vineyards of K√∂ppelberg and Saalh√§user. The ensemble of Cistercian monuments attests to the order's life and work and embodies the significant influence exerted in the wider Saale-Unstrut region and beyond the boundaries of the region.  History  Monastery Pforta Pforta Monastery was founded around 1132 on the initiative of bishop Udo I of Naumburg. It received only a very modest endowment of the order In order to be self-sufficient, it was located in the flood plain on the right bank of the Saale River to ensure sufficient water supply. The monks cultivated previous wetland areas and the monastery became soon one of the wealthiest and most influential monasteries throughout Central Germany for 400 years before it was closed in the course of the Reformation.A saying of the 12th century states the immense cultivation and colonization capacity of the Cistercians ‚Ä≥Give the monks a moor or a wild forest, let some years pass by, and you will find not only beautiful churches but also human settlements at this place‚Ä≥. The name of Porta, meaning Porta Coeli ‚Äì i.e. Pearly Gates ‚Äì , refers to the architecture of the richly ornamented western fa√ßade of the minster with its Roman triumphal arch portal and a gallery underneath the crucifixion group that did not at all correspond to the strict stipulations of the order.  Architecture  Facade of Monastery Pforta The minster was built in the 1130s in the plain character of the Cistercians monasteries. In 1251, the Cistercians decided on an ambitious building project. Even though the new church building with its west fa√ßade was still ascetic in the interior decor, it clearly reflected the significant economic and political power of the monastery. The Gothic choir of the minster is the architectural example of the regional Gothic reception with French roots, transferring the latest shapes and forms inspired by French Gothic design and adapting them to local conditions. The glass paintings of the church, including in Europe's oldest Cistercian tracery rose window preserved almost completely together with its glazing, are an extraordinary treasure of medieval paintings. Chapel of Monastery Pforta The so-called Abbot's Chapel (Abtskapelle) is considered to be an outstanding architectural example of the medieval infirmaries and nursing wards of the Cistercian monks. Before its conversion into an abbot‚Äôs home, it had been part of the infirmary wing, allowing people to participate in the mass from there. Rare elements were found in the structure such as the latrine and the chamber of the infirmary.  Hydraulic system  In 1180, the Cistercian monks created the Romanesque mill race called ‚Ä≥Kleine Saale‚Ä≥ (Little Saale), a canal of 10 kilometers length. The mill inside the monastery is one of the most significant and oldest preserved functional buildings in Central Germany. The Benedictine monks of St George, the canons of St Moritz in Naumburg, and the Naumburg cathedral chapter participated in the costs and maintenance of the Kleine Saale in return for rights of utilization. Maintenance work was managed by a water expert from Pforta Monastery and the highest-ranking fisherman from the Naumburg. The Kleine Saale shows the Cistercian hydraulic engineering at that time.  Grange  The Romanesque House is an impressive piece of evidence of a former grange of Pforta Monastery that was constructed to ensure economic independence. They were run by bearded lay brothers (conversi). The foundation of those granges was made possible because many rulers assigned possessions in return for burial rights for family members on the monastery grounds. The Cistercians successfully sold agricultural and craft products on the markets in Halle, Naumburg, Jena and Erfurt. With even greater success, they managed to enlist parts of the peasant population into their service, offering the liege lords compensation payments for their release from personal bondage. As a result of its aggressive economic policy of establishing granges, Pforta acquired a charter in 1215 to transport carts and loads through the margraviates of Meissen and Lower Lusatia ‚Äì and thus to Silesia ‚Äì without being charged taxes or dues.  Winemaking  The Cistercian monks set about profitably using the land they had bought in a single-minded, well-planned and versatile way. Economic activities of the Cistercians included quarrying, the planting of vines on the slopes of the Saale and other suitable areas, the planting of orchards, the establishment of smithies, workshops for weaving, fur production and shoe- making, the setting-up of bakeries and cheese dairies as well as intense sheep rearing, grain growing, timber rafting and fishing. The Cistercians expanded their property from the K√∂ppelberg vineyard, and created nine steep slope vineyards between 1195 and 1208. At the end of the Middle Ages, the monastery owned 58 vineyards between Bad K√∂sen and Ro√übach. Cellar and wine masters at Pforta ensured high quality in winemaking, measuring it according to vinum bonum (1226), vinum melius (1289) or vinum terrestre (country wine, around 1340).  History  Sandstone, Saale-Unstrut The area provided moderate climate, fertile soils, rich water sources and wood supply through forests and was populated by Stone Age hunters 380 000 years ago . From the Neolithic Age onwards throughout all prehistoric times, the area was settled. = The Early Middle Ages = Ebersorda The Migration Period brought decisive changes from 375 AD onwards and also had an influence on the Saale-Unstrut region. The local population, consisting of migrating Germanic Varini and Angles, merged to form the Thuringians. Following the defeat of the Thuringian army by Frankish troops in 531, the Merovingians as Frankish rulers settled groups of Frisians, Angles, Saxons and probably also Hessians to the south and north of the Unstrut in exchange for payment of tithes. These settlers were met by Slav Sorb tribes originating from the region of the Dnieper, who came westward as far as the River Saale, crossed it repeatedly and beginning to settle on its western banks. The Sorbs had more than 50 civitates, meaning central strongholds with relating settlements. Such a fortified district or ‚ÄúGau‚Äù developed on the site of today's town of Naumburg and was called ‚ÄúWethau‚Äù; the centre was a Sorb castle complex in Wettaburg (now an urban district of Naumburg) . The region by the Saale and Unstrut rivers had thus become a sensitive border area because it marked the border between the peoples of Germanic and Slav origin and also the north-eastern border of Christianity in continental Europe. In 766, a successful Frankish attack was launched against Wettaburg Castle, that was the headquarters of the Sorbs in the Saale-Unstrut region. The Frankish Empire was at its largest during the reign of Pippin‚Äôs son Charlemagne (768 ‚Äì 814). In a very bloody war lasting almost thirty years (772 ‚Äì 804), the pagan Saxons were conquered and their territory was fully integrated into the Frankish Empire. As elsewhere, Christianization ran parallel to military subjugation in the Saxon area. The Saale remained the lasting natural border with the Slavic territories. In conjunction with the hinterland, the Saale was protected from possible attacks from the east by a chain of closely neighboring strongholds and fortifications,including the ‚Ä≥Limes Sorabicus‚Ä≥. The territory of the Frankish Empire extended in the first quarter of the 9th century from the Iberian Peninsula in the west to the Elbe and Saale in the east, from the North Sea in the north to Central Italy in the south. Thus most of Christian Europe was united in Charlemagne‚Äôs hands. However, Charlemagne's successors were not able to maintain Imperial unity. In 919, Heinrich, the duke of Saxony, also known as Henry the Fowler, became king of the Franks and the Saxons. As a result, the Saale-Unstrut region moved from a peripheral position in the Frankish empire to the focus of political interest. Heinrich expanded his power along the eastern border of the Empire by conquering the Slav tribes (928/929) and defeating the Hungarians by the Unstrut in 933. As a result of Heinrich I's expansion policy and the conquest of the Slav tribes, the character of the area east of the Saale and Unstrut changed from a direct border area to a connecting region between the old settlement land to the west and the newly conquered regions by the Elbe. With the consent of the Pope and the German Imperial bishops, the Emperor arranged for dioceses and bishop's churches to be established in Merseburg, Zeitz and Meissen in 968, forming a new church province for the eastern part of the Empire within the equally newly founded archbishopric of Magdeburg.  The High Middle Ages  Schleberoda From the 10th century onwards, the Ekkehardine dynasty gained influence in the Empire. Contemporaneous Bishop Thietmar of Merseburg described the first prominent representative of this house, Ekkehard I, as a person with an outstanding lack of humility ‚Ä≥He was an ornament to the Empire, a treasure of the land, a hope for his subjects and a terror to his enemies and he would have been completely perfect if he had only been able to remain humble‚Ä≥. After the murder of the margrave Ekkehard I on 30 April 1002, Ekkehard's sons, Margrave Hermann (1009 ‚Äì 1038) and Margrave Ekkehard II (1009 ‚Äì 1046), assumed power in 1009. They became the most powerful rulers in the eastern part of the Empire and moved their family seat from Kleinjena to the ‚Ä≥Neue Burg‚Ä≥ (New Castle, Naumburg). The rise of Naumburg as ecclesiastical, political, cultural and economic centre of the Saale-Unstrut region had begun. In this context, it has to be emphasized that Sorb ‚Ä≥Smurds‚Ä≥ and German residents lived largely peacefully alongside each other. Certificate Emperor Conrad The bishops of Naumburg, the landgraves of Thuringia and the margraves of Meissen as lords of the town of Naumburg promoted a systematic development of the city into the most important town in the Saale-Unstrut region. In March 1131, Bishop Udo I met the Cistercian abbot Bernard of Clairvaux at the Imperial Diet in Li√®ge in March 1131, a meeting of central significance for the propagation of the Cistercian order in the Empire. As a result, a delegation of monks from the Walkenried Cistercian monastery moved to a location next to Naumburg in 1137/1138. The founding of the Cistercian Pforta Monastery contributed to the propagation of the Order on to Eastern Europe. One of the greatest achievements of Pforta Monastery was furthermore the settlement of peasants in these regions. This so-called ‚Ä≥Landesausbau‚Ä≥ in the High Middle Ages was supplemented by military protection of the positions already achieved.Due to increase of population, new public assignments of protection and administration for the diocese of Naumburg led to crucial changes in social structure. The prestige attained by the Naumburg bishop‚Äôs seat is expressed by the construction of a new cathedral around 1210 during the period of office of Bishop Engelhard (1206 ‚Äì 1242). For the Saale-Unstrut region, the Ludowingers were, together with the Wettin dynasty, the most influential aristocratic dynasty during the 12th and the 13th century. The Ludowingers created a princely court culture modeled to equal royal forms. The magnificent court of Count Palatine Hermann of Saxony (1181 ‚Äì 1217) at Neuenburg Castle was an extremely important center of literary activities in the Empire. The Wettins, with Margrave Heinrich the Illustrious (1221 ‚Äì 1288), were appointed as margraves to the east of the Saale. They were able to expand their territories and achieved political dominance in the whole Central German region during the 13th century, creating most favorable conditions for their homelands in the Saale-Unstrut region. The cooperation of the Cistercians with the Wettin and Ludowinger dynasties contributed to the transfer of spiritual, cultural and technological knowledge into the areas intended for colonization. Nevertheless, the economic emphasis moved gradually towards the east during the Late Middle Ages, when the importance of the relatively young town of Leipzig outdid that of the old trade fair town of Naumburg. = From the late Middle Ages to the Present = Following the Reformation instigated by Martin Luther(1485 ‚Äì 1546) in nearby Wittenberg, the Wettins and the region's nobility turned to Protestantism, promoting and funding the reformers. As a result of the alliance of Protestant rulers and spiritual leaders, the monasteries and religious establishments in Naumburg, Goseck, Zscheiplitz and Pforta were closed between 1533 and 1540 and their endowments and properties confiscated. Only the property rights held by the Naumburg Cathedral chapter remained untouched. Vineyard Steinmeister From the 18th century on, the castles along the Saale and Unstrut amidst their cultural landscape became prime subjects of romantic admiration. As a result of the Congress of Vienna, the kingdom of Saxony was forced to cede territories to the Prussian king in 1815. The landscape by the Saale and Unstrut now became part of the Prussian state until the end of the Second World War. Unlike many other regions, no drastic changes due to industrialization altered this landscape. It was due to Walter Hege's photographs published in 1925, that the founder figure of Uta became enormously popular but was exploited during the National Socialists‚Äô regime. The regime turned Neuenburg Castle into a training centre for senior leaders of the German Girls‚Äô Association (BDM) and the school at Pforta Monastery into a National Political Education Centre (NAPOLA) until the end of the regime. The Saale-Unstrut region was spared destruction during the Second World War. The liberation by American troops in the spring of 1945 was followed in the summer of the same year by hand-over of the area to the Red Army and the Saale-Unstrut region thus became part of East Germany (GDR). There was no attempt in the Saale-Unstrut area to demolish old town quarters. After the reunification of the two German states in 1990 the well-preserved cultural landscape of the Saale-Unstrut region became part of the Federal State of Saxony-Anhalt.

The group was active following World War I, during the period between 1921-1924. The organization officially disbanded in 1926, though private donations continued until the 1930s. Historical context Following the Russian Revolution and subsequent Bolshevik seizure of the government in 1917, Vladimir Lenin became the de facto leader of the newly formed Soviet Union. One of the first acts of the Lenin government was to confiscate and redistribute peasant lands in order to institute a system of collective farming. In the Volga region, farmers were required to relinquish their seed wheat, preventing them from planting wheat for the following year and effectively destroying the potential harvest. The Saratov and Samara provinces, along the Volga River, saw ethnic Germans resisting the seizure of peasant land and seed wheat. The Lenin government responded by ordering complete grain requisition and an extermination campaign. Along with this, crops failed due a drought, and by 1921, the region was being devastated by famine, starvation, and war. This part of the country, along with the Ukraine, was one of the largest grain-producing regions, and the loss of both labor power and collective farms would have been a blow to the new Bolshevik government. For fear of an increased number of rebellions, the Bolshevik government requested international famine relief organizations into the area, despite several years of denying a crisis. Many of the American relief efforts were coordinated under Herbert Hoover's American Relief Administration, which coordinated and oversaw non-governmental relief operations. The privately funded AVRS was a part of this organizational relief campaign of the United States federal government. =The famine= The Russian famine of 1921-1922 generated an enormous amount of media coverage in the United States, and public support for the victims of the famine was high. Reports of conditions from family members and journalists in the Volga region pointed suggested a bleak picture with an emphasis on the sensational, particularly as regards the deaths of children and the rumors of cannibalism among people living in remote areas of the Soviet Union. The Russian famine also generated a number of diseases, including typhus, that further decimated the population. In total, estimates suggest approximately five million people perished all over Russia during the famine. German Russians in the Volga region Specifically in the Volga, the Volga Germans living in the region numbered close to 750,000 people in 1914; by 1920, that number had dwindled to about 450,000 in a combination of death and flight. When the famine hit, the years 1921-1922 had the highest death toll, with approximately 170,000 deaths German settlements along the Volga River. After the Revolution and the end of the famine, the German population became one of the largest ethnic minority groups in Russia. In 1924, the Soviet government granted the German Russians a degree of autonomy as the Volga German Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. Ethnic Germans had migrated to this region under Catherine the Great, and were allowed to maintain cultural traditions such as religious practices and clothing. During the famine, however, many of these ethnic Germans fled to the United States, Canada, England, and other Western states, seeking refuge from the risk of starvation. Others left for the cities and other towns of Russia and Europe, hoping to escape the devastation. Many of these expatriates left family behind in Russia, although many of them continued to have contact with their relatives and friends who remained in the Volga region. =Formation of the AVRS= The flight of German Russians to the United States resulted in a large German American population. Beginning in 1920, following the First World War, many German Americans received letters from family members still living near the Volga. Upper and middle class Americans considered the possibilities of aiding the Russians fleeing the number regime. Relief efforts began to crop up, and efforts to send aid to various regions of Russia dealing with famine or starvation, particularly from churches and other religious organizations. Two organizations independently formed to specifically support ethnic Germans in the Volga River area - George Repp's Volga Relief Society in Portland, Oregon, and the Central States Volga Relief Society, in Lincoln, Nebraska. Both groups solicited donations and assistance from American Volga German communities to aid their families left in Russia during the famine, which they then used to distribute a variety of items and cash assistance to Volga communities in Russia. On November 4, 1922, the two organizations joined together to form the American Volga Relief Society (AVRS). By the end of 1922, the newly formed AVRS began soliciting funds from Volga Germans living in California, Nebraska, Colorado, Washington, Montana, Oklahoma, Illinois, Kansas, and other states with large German-Russian populations. Areas of operation The AVRS operated primarily in the Saratov and Samara provinces in what would eventually become the German Volga Republic. The group also had operations in the Samara-Koshki German settlement area, and German settlements in Omsk in Siberia. The group would later spread operations to Germany itself, sending donations to orphanages and missions. Scope of assistance According to some estimates, the AVRS managed to raise over a million dollars for relief efforts, and it along with other relief efforts may have reached several thousand individuals living in German Volga sentiments. The AVRS sent material resources that varied from community to community, but was at least partially responsible for the large-scale effort coordinated by the ARA, other religious groups, and a number of additional private actors that fed and provided assistance to perhaps 10 million individuals living in famine-struck parts of Russia during the early years of the Soviet Union. Despite the efforts of the AVRS, the ARA, and other non-governmental organizations, a large number of the population suffered under the final days of the famine. =Solicitation= Starting in 1921, the organization sent letters to various communities along the river to inquire about the number of villages before and after the war, livestock and equipment before and after the war, the number of people in need of assistance, and the kinds of assistance that communities needed the most, which included from clothing, foodstuffs, livestock, or farm equipment. These letters also requested that each community elect a local leader to organize and coordinate local distribution of materials. These letters were the starting point for a longer negotiation about the needs of locals and the resources of the AVRS. =Clothing= The majority of requests were for of clothing and footwear. Clothing was a particularly important, given the cold winter of the areas in which the AVRS was operating. After two years of starvation and famine before relief organizations arrived, clothing, shoes, and stockings were necessary to prevent hypothermia, but also to simply clothe the people in items that were not rags. Some communities also specifically requested bedding to replace old bedding that was no longer functional. =Food= Despite the famine, few communities requested foodstuffs or named food as a primary need. Some specific requests were made on behalf of the sick, including rice, cocoa, sugar, tea, and fat. Nonetheless, a large number of the donations and supplies that the AVRS delivered to famine-struck regions included foodstuffs. The group distributed these goods, along with wheat, rye, potatoes, yeast, meat, and millet. The grains were particularly important given the failure and confiscation of wheat crops. In many cases, food supplies ran low, and occasionally the sickest or \\"most in need\\" individuals (rather than entire families) would receive foodstuffs and other supplies. =Agricultural needs= Many letters from Volga communities to the AVRS also requested livestock, seeds, and farm equipment to revitalize agriculture and end the famine. Seed potatoes were also provided to several communities. Agriculture would have played a vital role in supporting the Volga community, particularly in smaller settlements in remote areas with little access to transit. =Building materials= Some communities also requested building materials, or money to purchase materials to repair religious structures like chapels and churches. The AVRS also distributed firewood for the poor. =Medicine= Medical needs were high a starving society. Requests for doctors and medications for \\"the sick\\" were common, and the AVRS attempted to deliver essential medical supplies to regions that requested them. =Other materials= The AVRS distributed a number of materials that fall outside of these categories, including * sewing needles * writing pens * thread * a weaving loom to a widow =Reception= The vast majority of Volga Germans who received material support from the relief efforts of the AVRS sent letters of gratitude, or had others who could send gratitude on their behalf. A large number of records addressed to the AVRS include both an expression of gratitude and a request for additional aid. That said, there is little in the historical record to give any insight into how the Soviet government responded to particular forms of aid, particularly building materials for religious institutions, which would have been outlawed during the early years of the Soviet era. Additionally, sources show little insight into the public perception of groups like the AVRS, much less the organization itself, that indicate either public approval or disapproval of the efforts of the AVRS. In contrast, relief organizations that originated in elite circles saw some public praise of relief efforts in Russia and surrounding areas that supported refugees.Bumgardner, E. S. (1923, September 15). Features: Memories of first aid to Russian art in Constantinople. Vogue, 62, 168-168, 170. Organizational leadership The first president of the AVRS was Dr. H. P. Weckesser of Lincoln. Jacob Volz of York, Nebraska, was the on-site representative of the organization in Russia. Hebert Hoover headed the American Relief Association through the United States federal government, which coordinated with private non-governmental organizations to facilitate relief to the region. Weckesser died in 1923 relief efforts, and vice president John Rohrig took over operations in his wake. =George Repp= George Repp was a member of the Zion Congregational Church in Portland, Oregon. At one of the earliest meetings of the Volga Relief Society, the organization selected Repp to work with the ARA on the ground in Russia. A businessman, Repp sacrificed his time and family to travel to Russia to work with refugees and relief efforts for a year. He arrived in Russia on October 10, 1921, and began making arrangements for food and supply distribution, organizing local committees, and documenting conditions in the area. He returned to the United States in September 1922 and continued to organize relief efforts from the U.S. =Jacob Volz= Jacob Volz took on the task of coordinating relief efforts from Russia between 1922 and 1923. Volz was faced with the difficult task of choosing which families and occasionally, which individual members of families, were most in need, and distributing materials accordingly. He kept detailed records of his distributions and observations, sending receipts back to the AVRS regularly. He also distributed mail and collected additional information regarding addresses and locations of ethnic Germans receiving aid in the Volga. Volz's letters indicate occasional challenges to effective aid distribution ‚Äì lost packages or illegible receipts contributed to the confusion. Volz's father died while he was working in Russia, and he received news of the death from letters organized by the AVRS. =Local relief coordinators= AVRS sent letters to villages and communities and asked for each to elect a leader to coordinate relief efforts locally. The job entailed managing correspondence with the AVRS, passing along requests for aid, distribution, and reporting back how the goods were distributed and to whom. The men elected to this job were literate and able to communicate independently with the AVRS, and their letters and requests are housed at the AVRS Archive in Nebraska, and a number are listed here. * Eduard F√∂ll was the coordinator in Malousensk. * Johann Jacob Stumpf coordinated relief efforts in Neu-Warenburg * David Schneider and Philipp Kisselman coordinated relief efforts in Oberdorf. * Jacob Velte and Jacob Reichert led relief efforts in Dietel and Oleschna. * Friedrich Friedrichovich Sch√§fer coordinated relief efforts in Kana in the Pallasovka region. * Friedrich Groh coordinated relief efforts in Kraft. Disbanding Little record exists of why the AVRS disbanded. One possible explanation that goes unaddressed in the documents of the AVRS is the formation of the Volga German Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, for which the Soviet government ceded partial formal control to the region to govern its own affairs. This largely consisted of the ability of Volga Germans to practice their own religion, as well as to govern their own affairs under the authority of the Soviet government. The famine ended after 1922, though the Volga likely spent several years recovering from the aftermath, making the organization's work a useful contribution to the rebuilding efforts following the famine, the First World War, and the revolution. The ARA itself closed its offices in 1923, giving the oversight organization and federal relief efforts a shorter lifespan than at least one of its constitutive organizations. =Donors= An extensive catalogue of donors exists in the historical archive of the AVRS. A blank form was sent to several religious communities who considered donations. Perhaps the greatest amount of money however, was collected from donors who bought \\"subscriptions\\" ‚Äì that is, they were able to contribute small or, in some cases, large sums of money to the relief effort. Around four hundred individuals scattered across Nebraska and other central states had continuous monthly donations for a year or more, according to the historical record. AVRS and other relief efforts Around the time of the transition to communism time, a large number of people living in newly communist territories left and fled to surrounding areas. Many went to Constantinople, and American relief efforts also went to the areas surrounding the new Soviet Union. American elites donated to refugee efforts in various parts of Eastern Europe and non-governmental relief efforts began to support the lives and livelihoods, particularly artistic endeavors, of the refugees. The AVRS was one of a number of private organizations that was founded by middle class Americans, and was one of the organizations that relied primarily on religious groups rather than soliciting funds from advertising or others means. Other active religious organizations at the time included the Quakers, the Mennonites, and Jews, who led parallel fundraising and resource distribution efforts with the AVRS and the ARA. =Relationship with the American government= The American Relief Administration (ARA) was one of the first governmental forms of relief for the government, and was the primary governmental oversight organization of the AVRS. In addition to national support from the United States federal government, individuals from other Western states including England and Canada sought advice on how to contribute to relief efforts in the German Volga region, along with a number of other areas hit hard by the famine.

Recognizing the instinctual forces of love and hate and applying science for the encouragement of love instead of self-destruction will result in the achievement of human happiness. The book compromises ten chapters in total. In the early chapters, Menninger builds up on the framework of his previous book Man against Himself in which he presents the \\"psychoanalytic theory of suicide\\".Cavan, R. (1938). American Sociological Review, 3(3), 410-410. Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/2084080 The theory attributes the main reason for suicide to our unconscious wish to die. Usually, this instinct is neutralized by our love instinct, but under certain circumstances the process fails and our unconscious wish to die takes over. In Love against Hate, Menninger extends his concept of instinctual forces. He analyses the main issues of a society which forces the neglect of our instinctual needs and consequently strengthens unconscious passive aggression and self-destructive behavior. With an emphasis on the sources of frustration already occurring in childhood as a consequence of the mother's own frustration, he gradually builds up a vicious cycle of repressed aggressions resulting in destructive behavior that is passed on from generation to generation. In the remaining chapters Menninger proposes a solution how this vicious circle could be broken by means of work, play, faith, hope, and love. Love against Hate is written \\"to the memory of Sigmund Freud\\". Menninger uses many of Freud's theories as a basis for his own work and tries to explain them in an understandable manner for the lay reader.  Content  The nature of human is determined by two contradicting instincts, namely the instinct of destructiveness (= hate) as well as the instinct of life (= love). Looking at a society bestowed with war, in which aggression and hate override the life instinct, raises the question by which means one can encourage love and transform the impulse to fight. Karl Menninger begins with an examination of the reasons why aggression dominates our society, revealing that the major contributors are the frustration of women, the depreciation of femininity, as well as the resulting frustration of a child. Women's frustration is rooted in a men-ruled society, which undermines the erotic instinct of a woman and consequently her sexual satisfaction. Furthermore, it is the passiveness of men that dissatisfies women the most. Frustrated by men and deprived from erotic satisfaction, women unconsciously repudiate their own femininity and built up passive aggressions towards men. However, if women then take on the role of a mother, the repressed aggressive impulses towards men have a negative impact on the development of the male child. This is supported by the fact that child's \\"pattern of loving and hating is still in the process of formation\\". Forbidding the child to follow his masculine instincts, which is a requirement for his ability to love, disturbs a healthy psychosexual development. Instead males develop a negative attitude towards women already at a young age which causes them to be incapable of loving at later age. Therefore, they represent a new source of frustration for other women, which results in a vicious cycle. The first step in breaking this vicious cycle of transferring hate from one generation to the next requires the awareness of one's own repressed aggressions. Only by becoming aware of the full extent, one can sublimate the destructive energy with an erotic instinct into the construction of something fruitful. The key of success in the sublimation process is provided by means of work, play, faith, hope, and love. The most convenient way of transforming one's aggression is work. Even though the process of work is representing a fight in its nature, the aim of work is the construction of something fruitful. Therefore, work provides the possibility to make use of one's destructive instinct in order to create something of a positive value. Another way to achieve sublimation is provided by play. Although society mostly denies the usefulness of play, it offers the possibility of discharging aggressive energy in a pleasurable manner. An additional advantage of play is that it is a form of relieving aggressive energy, which does not have any consequences for reality. A further opportunity to encourage love is faith. Faith can be directed towards religion or science. Depending on the individual both methods can provide a protection against the dangers from the outside world, as well as the dangers resulting from one's own hostility. Lastly, one should include hope as the basis for a better world. Realizing one's hopes of a better world can only be achieved by providing the next generation with the right values. Therefore, education has the responsibility to put more emphasis on the nature of one's emotions and how to deal with them. Finally, it is love that has the power to neutralize one's impulse to fight. The \\"progress of civilization has been made at the cost of the erotic life of mankind\\", but there is hope. A society can change and one should use the intelligence and the means provided by science to implement love as the most important value and consequently make the world a peaceful place.  Critical reception  Love against Hate received critical acclaim. Critics mostly praised the book for its comprehensive and provocative manner of discussing the war of our instinctual forces and its consequences for the human kind. The British Journal of Psychiatry calls it an \\"interesting and provocative work‚Äù. The American Journal of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation compliments Menninger's piece of work as an ‚Äúextremely well written stimulating and illuminating discussion of psychological and psychoanalytic areas of study and experience‚Äù. Furthermore, the journal appreciates the psychiatrist's practical suggestions for therapy as ‚Äúit will leave the therapist with a much more comprehensive understanding of love and hate in human nature and the bearing of these powerful sources upon the problems of therapy‚Äù. Lastly, the Journal of the American Medical Association emphasized in its review the importance of Menninger's book for society in stating that ‚Äúsuch wisdom is needed today more than ever before, for an explosive individual or national outburst of temper of a series of badly mixed signals might blow us all away‚Äù.  Context  Karl Menninger's piece of work was published in 1942, a time during which the world was \\"set on fire\\". Love against Hate was first brought out in the United States of America, which played a major role in the Second World War since the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. In his book, Menninger describes the world's state of war as a ‚Äúdisease, a world sickness, for which we know no ready cure‚Äù. However, it was not only the state of war itself for which no \\"cure\\" was known at that time, but also the mental health problems of its victims. The aftermath of World War I revealed that the experiences during that combat had a traumatic influence on the mental health of the soldiers. They suffered from the so-called \\"combat neurosis\\", a term which would nowadays meet the criteria for a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. In order to avoid this scenario of the First World War, psychologists developed psychometric tests, designed to screen out subjects who were evaluated as too weak or unstable for war conditions. Despite all the effort put in preventive processes, the attempt to avoid war neurosis during the Second World War failed with over a million soldiers being affected. It was only then that the military began to encourage the treatment for psychiatric illness. William Menninger, brother of Karl Menninger, became chief psychiatrist of the armed forces with the aim of providing support and treatment for the soldiers suffering from mental illnesses caused by the circumstances of war. Overall, the mental health crisis of the Second World War in the United States \\"drew national attention to the pressing need for psychiatric services in the United States, and made clear a previously overlooked concept: mental illness was not necessarily innate\\". The understanding that every person could develop mental health issues under certain circumstances resulted in a transformation of the perception of psychology as a field, as well as its treatment possibilities.

The film stars Johnny Depp, Rosemarie DeWitt, Danny Huston, Zoey Deutch, Ron Livingston and Odessa Young. It had its world premiere at the Zurich Film Festival on October 5, 2018. It was released on May 17, 2019, by Saban Films.  Plot  College English professor Richard Brown is in the office of his doctor and receives sad news concerning his health. He has advanced stage cancer of his lungs, which has spread throughout his body with mortal consequences. His life expectancy is set by the doctor as being six months without treatment, which might be extended to 12‚Äì18 months with aggressive and painful cancer treatment. Richard is devastated by the news, becoming self-abusive in verbal tirades against himself, and walking through town and around campus as if in an emotional stupor. Upon arrival at home for dinner, Richard decides to tell his wife, Veronica, and only daughter, Olivia, the bad news and prepare them for the worst outcome possible. The dinner conversation, however, takes unexpected turns. His daughter announces that she is a lesbian and that she has taken a lover. Veronica dismisses her daughter as going through a phase, which causes Olivia to storm out of the dining room, upset by her mother's lack of support. Richard's relationship with his wife is troubled and tortured. Veronica confronts Richard with the fact that he has been a poor husband and that she has taken a lover, the dean of the college where Richard teaches as part of the tenured faculty in the English department. With everyone having argued at the dinner table, Richard never gets to make his medical report of his crisis situation; when Veronica questions him about it, he says that he was concerned that he had overcooked the steaks. On campus the next day, Richard begins telling his students about the urgency of living life to its fullest. He criticizes a number of stereotypes he superficially observes in the classroom and starts weeding out the students whom he feels are there to only get easy good grades, or otherwise seek cosmetic benefits from a friendly faculty. After over half of the potential classroom students leave the class as being of no interest to them, Richard is left with a core group of students who seem attracted to his unorthodox version of straight talk. They decide to stick with the class, and Richard's newly proclaimed unorthodoxy. Among the students remaining is the niece of the college dean, who seems to admire Richard for all his differences with her uncle since both of them, Richard and her uncle, are members of the faculty in different departments. Richard asks his friend, Peter Matthew, who happens to be his department's chairman, to arrange for a sabbatical leave for him on immediate terms. The chairman tells him that it is impossible on such short notice, but Richard continues to press him. Finally, Richard tells him that he is dying of cancer and that he has no options but to request the immediate sabbatical leave. The chairman, who considers Richard a close friend and colleague, says that he will try his best and tries to reassure Richard as best as he can by way of some emotional support. The classroom for Richard becomes a place for him to vent his frustration with life and to encourage his young students not to fall into the traps and false career paths that he took in his own life. The students are highly responsive, with one of the gay students offering Richard some pot brownies and a sexual tryst in Richard's office. The dean's niece, on another occasion, asks Richard for a slow romantic dance at a local club. Richard's reliance on alcohol and recreational drugs in these passing days and weeks after receiving his bad news becomes progressively worse. In one instance, he passes out and needs to be hospitalized because of his extreme intoxication. As his final words to his students, and later to his colleagues, he stresses the importance of seizing one's own existence. To truly acknowledge the fact that we are all going to die and appreciate the (little) time we each have left. After his bad news diagnosis, Richard becomes able to express warmth to his close family members and remaining friends. He finally bonds with his daughter by accepting her coming out as a lesbian and manages to at least partially patch things up with his wife during a frenzied and spontaneous drug experimentation episode in their bedroom. The end, however, seems inevitable as Richard does not take on the doctor's option of using chemotherapy to extend his life by a single year, and Richard decides to leave his home and family on his final sabbatical leave, which has finally been approved by his college. Richard decides to take the less-traveled path on his own, in his car, and with his dog, in order not to be a burden upon his wife and daughter in his final months of life as his cancer rapidly progresses.

Bush graduated from Harvard Law School and practiced in Washington, D.C. and Louisville, Kentucky, where he served as president of the local branch of the Federalist Society. In 2017, he was nominated to a seat on the Sixth Circuit by President Donald Trump. During his confirmation hearings, it was revealed that Bush had authored pseudonymous blog posts in which he disparaged gay rights, compared abortion to slavery, and cited alt-right websites promoting birtherism and other false right-wing conspiracy theories. He was confirmed in the Senate by the Republican majority on a party-line vote of 51‚Äì47 in July 2017.  Education and career  Bush received his Bachelor of Arts, summa cum laude, in 1986 from Vanderbilt University, where he was phi beta kappa. He received his Juris Doctor, cum laude, in 1989 from Harvard Law School, where he was Executive Editor of the Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy and an Ames Moot Court Finalist. After graduating from law school, Bush served as a law clerk to Judge J. Smith Henley of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. He practiced law at the firm of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher in Washington, D.C., before taking a job at Bingham Greenebaum Doll in Louisville, Kentucky. He was a partner at the firm and co-chair of the firm's litigation department before becoming a judge. Bush specialized in complex litigation, including antitrust, securities, financial institutions, insurance, intellectual property, and product liability disputes. Bush is chairman of the Louisville chapter of the Federalist Society.  Federal judicial service  = Nomination and confirmation = On May 8, 2017, President Donald Trump announced that he would nominate Bush to the seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit vacated by Judge Danny Julian Boggs, who took senior status on February 28, 2017. A hearing on his nomination before the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary was held on June 14, 2017. On a questionnaire submitted to the committee, Bush acknowledged that between 2007 and 2016, he had pseudonymously authored approximately 400 blog posts on Elephants in the Bluegrass, a blog founded by his wife, Bridget. His blog posts expressed opposition to gay marriage, the Affordable Care Act, public financing of political campaigns, and the idea of trying terrorists in civilian courts. Bush also compared abortion to slavery, and cited media reports containing \\"birther\\" falsehoods about Barack Obama's citizenship. When questioned about his blogging during his judicial nomination process, Bush said that \\"my personal views are irrelevant to the position for which I have been nominated\\" and that \\"blogging is a political activity. It is not appropriate to bring politics to the bench.\\" On July 19, 2017, the Senate voted in favor of cloture by a vote of 51‚Äì48, and on the following day voted 51‚Äì47 to confirm him. He received his judicial commission on July 21, 2017. = Notable cases =  Abortion  Bush authored the opinion in EMW Women's Surgical Center v. Beshear (2019), in which the Sixth Circuit upheld, 2-1, a Kentucky law compelling physicians to show and describe a fetal ultrasound to patients before performing an abortion. The law, part of a years-long effort to restrict abortion access in Kentucky, had previously been deemed unconstitutional by a lower court. Bush wrote that the law \\"provides truthful, non-misleading, and relevant information aimed at informing a patient about her decision to abort unborn life.\\" Judge Alan Eugene Norris joined Bush's opinion; Judge Bernice Donald dissented, writing that the Kentucky law \\"has coopted physicians' examining tables, their probing instruments, and their voices in order to espouse a political message, without regard to the health of the patient or the judgment of the physician.\\". On December 9, 2019, the Supreme Court declined to review the case, leaving in place Bush's opinion.  ADA  Bush authored the court's opinion in McDonald v. UAW-GM Center for Human Resources finding that the Americans with Disabilities Act did not require the defendant to extend the employee's lunch break for her to exercise. The plaintiff requested an extended lunch break for doctor-required exercise. The employer was in the decision-making process regarding the accommodation when the employee was suspended for insubordination and use of profanity toward her superior. During the suspension, the plaintiff voluntarily quit her job. The court found that the doctor did not require that the employee workout during her lunch break, that it was only the employee's preference. Furthermore, the employer was engaged in an interactive process regarding the requested accommodation when the employee quit voluntarily, therefore no ADA violation was found.  Separation of powers  Bush joined the court's opinion in Hagy v. Demers & Adams, LLC involving a letter sent from an attorney discharging the plaintiffs' debts following a mortgage foreclosure. The letter failed to include language disclosing that it came from a debt collector as required under the Fair Debt Collections Protections Act (FDCPA). Despite the fact that no injury or harm came from the failure to disclose, nor was the letter unfair, deceptive, or harassing as the FDCPA aims to prevent, the district court awarded $1,000 in statutory penalties and over $74,000 in attorneys fees to the plaintiffs. The circuit court reversed, finding that the plaintiffs had no standing in court because no harm had occurred outside of a bare procedural violation. Citing the Supreme Court in Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, the circuit court found that Congress had overstepped it's congressional authority by creating injuries that satisfy Article III standing requirements where no actual harm had occurred. The court found that Congress may not ‚Äúsimply enact an injury into existence, using its lawmaking power to transform something that is not remotely harmful into something that is.‚Äù  Qualified immunity  Bush wrote a concurrence in the case Yates v. Davis regarding former Rowan County, Kentucky court clerk Kim Davis, who refused to marriage licenses following the U.S. Supreme Court's decision recognizing a constitutional right to same-sex marriage in Obergefell v. Hodges. The court found that Davis was not entitled to sovereign or qualified immunity and allowed the case to move forward. Bush authored a concurrence, agreeing that Davis did not qualify for sovereign or qualified immunity, but using a different level of scrutiny to evaluate the question of qualified immunity. On June 18, 2020 in Wright v. City of Euclid, Bush reversed the district court's decision to grant qualified immunity for police officers who tased, pepper-sprayed, and arrested Lamar Wright, a black man who had his hands raised and was cooperating with the officers but had trouble exiting his vehicle due to a colostomy bag from a recent surgery. The circuit court's unanimous decision to remand for a jury trial on unconstitutional use of force, false arrest, extended detention, and malicious prosecution claims was authored by Bush. The court also reversed the dismissal of Wright's Monell claims based on police training that notably included a Chris Rock video and a cartoon of a police officer beating a figure lying on the ground.

Early life and military career Born Harold Freeman on 30 December 1897, he was the eldest son of Edward Freeman, a British Army officer, and Katherine Margaret. Freeman was educated at Summer Fields School, Marlborough College and, during the First World War, attended the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, where he graduated on 13 July 1915 and was subsequently commissioned as a second lieutenant into his father's regiment, the Royal Welch Fusiliers. He served with the 1st Battalion, Royal Welch Fusiliers, part of the 22nd Brigade of the 7th Division, a Regular Army unit, on the Western Front, where he was awarded the Military Cross during the Battle of Passchendaele in August 1917, and, with his battalion, was sent to the Italian Front later in the year, where it remained until the end of the war.Smart, p. 108 Between the wars Remaining in the army between the wars, Freeman married Jessie Job on 10 September 1921 and together they had three children; Harold Warren Freeman, born in 1923; Edward Augustus Carson, born in 1930; and Alice Avalon, born in 1932. He served with his regiment throughout the interwar period, mainly with the 1st Battalion, in operations in Wazaristan in the early 1920s before returning to the United Kingdom where he became adjutant to a Territorial Army (TA) battalion of his regiment from 1924 to 1928. He attended the Staff College, Camberley from 1928 to 1929 and later served in Cyprus, where he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for suppressing a Greek Cypriot rebellion between 1931 and 1932. Second World War At the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, Freeman-Attwood (having added Attwood to his name in 1937) by now a lieutenant colonel, was serving as a General Staff Officer (GSO) with the 50th (Northumbrian) Motor Division, a TA formation. He was sent with the division to France in January 1940 where it became part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). He served with the division throughout the Battle of France in May 1940 and took part in the Dunkirk evacuation, and, in late July, was promoted to brigadier and assumed command of the 5th London Brigade, another TA unit, part of the 2nd London Division (both redesignated in November 1940 as the 141st (London) Infantry Brigade and 47th (London) Infantry Division). In November 1941 he was promoted to major general and became General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the 46th Infantry Division, another TA unit, in succession to Major General Miles Dempsey. The division, recruiting from the North Midlands and the West Riding of Yorkshire, was composed of the 137th, 138th and 139th Infantry Brigades, along with supporting divisional troops. In January 1943, Freeman-Attwood led the division overseas to French North Africa, where, upon its arrival in Tunisia, came under command of Lieutenant General Charles Allfrey's V Corps, itself part of Lieutenant General Kenneth Anderson's British First Army. The division fought in the Tunisian Campaign, most notably in the final stages of the Battle of Kasserine Pass and in Operation Ochsenkopf, until the campaign came to an end in May 1943, with Freeman-Attwood being awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his division's actions at Djebel Abiod. Retirement and later years In August, as the division was preparing to take part in the Allied invasion of Italy, Freeman-Attwood was relieved of his command and retired from the army in October, after being court-martialled for writing home in a letter to his wife expressing a wish to be drinking champagne in Italy on their wedding anniversary and disclosing details of future military operations.Smart, p. 109 Returning to civilian life, he joined the Imperial Chemical Industries and, by 1949, was Staff Manager. Freeman-Attwood divorced in 1945, and remarried to Marion Louise the following year, he retired to Nottinghamshire where he was involved in politics and active for the Conservative Party.

The aim of the grip is to use varying fulcrum positions and finger technique to achieve the control, speed, and power of a two-mallet grip while being able to use all four mallets. Description This grip is based on the positioning of the Burton grip, with two mallets being held loosely in each hand. However, while the Burton grip uses mainly wrist and arm motion to create the stroke, the Fulcrum grip uses finger control to manipulate the stroke.Porter, Joe. ‚ÄúA New Six-Mallet Marimba Technique and Its Pedagogical Approach‚Äù, MA thesis, University of Lethbridge, 2011, pp 9.Burton gripthumbrightFulcrum Grip. Note the fulcrum between thumb and index finger, and outside mallet tip out of the hand. By utilizing a fulcrum between the thumb and index finger, the mallets are allowed to come out of the palm of the hand before they are snapped back in by the fingers, like a two-mallet player or drummer with sticks in matched grip.Saindon, Ed. \\"The Fulcrum Grip\\". Percussive Notes, Nov. 2008, pp. 42-43. The result is increased control over dynamic range, speed, power, and efficiency in arm and wrist motion, producing a full sound with minimized mallet stroke height.Menasch√©, Emile. ‚ÄúThe Fulcrum Grip‚Äù. Drum Corps International Magazine, Fall 2009. pp. 38.Mallet comes out of the hand to be snapped in by the fingers. The stroke of each mallet in this grip uses a vertical motion, with the mallet acting as an extension of the forearm. This eliminates the supinated, rotating motion of the forearm used by many four-mallet players which can lead to wrist, elbow, and arm injuries. Because of the looseness of the grip, the mallets are commonly wrapped with tape to increase friction and diameter size. This also helps to reduce clicking sounds between the sticks. Two fulcrum points are used, each relating to a mallet interval spread: \\"small to mid-range\\" and \\"mid-range to large.‚Äù  Small to mid-range spread  Fulcrum is between thumb and middle finger. Tight spread The fulcrum of the small to mid-range spread is located between the third finger and thumb. The tip of the third finger is held to the thumb side of the outside mallet to control the outside mallet and keep it in the palm of the hand. The thumb and second finger are held in a straight position along the inside mallet as it moves in a vertical upward-downward motion. The third finger is used to control the inside mallet as it comes out of the hand and to snap it back in. center Small to mid-range spread To control the outside mallet stroke, the third and fourth fingers are used. Outside mallet is controlled by the third and fourth fingers. Mid-range to large spread fulcrum Full Spread Fulcrum is between the thumb and index finger. Outside mallet tip is out of the hand. The fulcrum of the mid-range to large spread is located between the thumb and the first joint of the second finger, like matched grip with a drumstick. The tip of the outside mallet is not held by the third finger and comes out of the palm of the hand to form a right angle with the inside mallet, almost perpendicular to the forearm. The third, fourth, and fifth fingers are used to control the inside mallet and snap it back into the palm.Fulcrum is between the thumb and index finger. Outside mallet tip is out of the hand. Third, fourth, and fifth fingers manipulate the stroke. The outside mallet is controlled by the third finger in conjunction with a pronated forearm movement. Outside mallet is controlled by middle (third) finger with pronated movement in the wrist, pivoting along the inside mallet.  Playing chords  This grip facilitates playing high-velocity chord strokes using minimal motion in the wrists and arms. When playing a chord stroke, the mallets will start close to the bars of the vibraphone. They are pulled up using a subtle inward wrist motion and snapped down by the fingers. For a very full-sounding stroke, the mallets are allowed to come all the way out of the hand to reach a right angle perpendicular to the bars and are snapped down by the fingers. In combination with wrist and forearm movement this motion has the potential for a high-velocity, full-sounding chord stroke.The wrist \\"flicks\\" the mallets up so that the fingers can snap them down.  Power and speed  Inside mallets pivot off the outside in the full spread. The fulcrum is between thumb and index finger. The greatest level of power and speed is achieved by using the inside mallets in the full spread position, with the fulcrum between the thumb and index finger. This method allows maximum stroke height with minimal motion in wrist and arms, similar to two-mallet technique. The outside mallet forms a right angle that the inside mallet pivots off of. The power afforded to the inner mallets allows the player to use all four mallets when playing melodies, rather than just two leading mallets. This is achieved by smoothly transitioning between the two fulcrum points and various spreads to use each mallet comfortably and efficiently.

The original wooden altar was later replaced by one in marble which was removed from St Mary's, Nairn. Prior to the church being built Mass was said in a house in Dalcrag by a priest based in Glenmoriston who rowed across Loch Ness to say Mass. St. Mary MacKillop visited this church on 12-13 December 1873, during a visit from Australia and remarked upon the clean and simple quarters of the Parish Priest, Fr. Bissett.

(2013). Strategic Management: An Integrated Approach. USA: South-Western Cengage Learning. The key to having a complete value-creating strategy is to adopt a holistic approach that includes business strategy, financial strategy, technology strategy, marketing strategy and investor strategy.The Boston Consulting Group Corporate Development and Finance (2017). \\"Value Creation Strategy\\". The objective of the firm has to be based on creating value in an efficient way because it is the starting point for all businesses and it will generate profit after cost.Eric Jorgenson (2015). \\"Why Value Creation is the Foundation of Business: How to define it, measure it, and manage it\\". Eric Beinhocker, the Executive Director of the Institute for New Economic Thinking at the Oxford Martin School, University of Oxford, says in his book The Origin of Wealth that the origin of wealth is knowledge. Knowledge does not have to be perceived as an assumption, or as an external factor. It has to be in the heart of the business.Beinhocker, Eric (2007). 14. The Origin of Wealth (English). HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL PRESS. p. 317. . For this reason, the value-creating strategy must include a thorough knowledge of each area of the company in order to develop a competitive advantage.  Business strategy  In business strategy, it is important to distinguish strategic decisions which imply long-lasting commitments, from tactical decisions, which are short-term responses to the current environment. The strategic decisions define the evolution of state variables that provide a scenario in which current tactics are played out. For instance, investment in physical capital has a strategic role as the basis to determine the success of the enterprise in the future. A firm can gain an advantage by investing and creating a more dynamic behavior that in the future will lead its rivals to respond by competing less dynamically or by completely staying out of the market.Shapiro, Carl (1989). \\"The Theory of Business Strategy\\". The RAND Journal of Economics, Vol.20, No.1 (Spring, 1989), pp. 125-137 Published by: Wiley on behalf of RAND Corporation.  Financial strategy  For both new and established businesses, it is essential to establish a strong and clear financial strategy that determines the guiding principles in all financial decisions. Financial decisions are of three types: the investment decision, the financing decision, and the dividend decision. Investment decisions cover capital investment and current investment. Financing decisions include targets for the ratios of debt to total capital and of total debt to total assets. Dividend decisions are concerned with dividend growth and dividend payout.F. Slater and J. Zwirlein (1996). \\"Finance Theory and Financial Strategy\\". Managerial and Decision Economics, Vol.17, No.3 (May-Jun, 1996), pp. 253-266. Published by: Wiley.  Technology strategy  Technology implementation is often an important way to drive relative advantage over competitors, even among small businesses.  Social media  Social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn are effective tools. Adopting an effective social media strategy can rapidly improve a company‚Äôs branding and visibility by facilitating the interaction with its customers. Social media sends direct messages and can attract many people to the company's website as long as its design and content are compatible with the quality of the strategy; otherwise, it will be difficult to retain the new public.  New technologies  Nowadays, most private enterprises have adopted modern technology. They have created user- friendly websites, online catalogs, and call centers, and they have restructured inventory management. Nevertheless, there are still other important aspects of technology, mentioned by Forbes, that large business are adopting and that small businesses may also be able to adopt: * Real-time, for marketing and product promotion. * Online customer relationship management (CRM). * Tablet-based systems for employees to provide instant, one-to-one responses to customers' needs. * Subscription-based Software as a service (SaaS).Michael Evans (22-10-2013). \\"Technology-Based Strategies To Supercharge Your Business\\". FORBES. (English).  Marketing strategy  An effective marketing strategy covers the \\"4 P's\\" of the marketing mix: Product, price, place, and promotion. * Product: variety, design, quality, features, brand name, packaging, services * Price: list price, discounts, allowance, payment period, credit terms * Place: channels, coverage, assortments, locations, inventory, transportation, logistics * Promotion: advertising, personal selling, sales promotion, public relations. Nevertheless, these \\"4 P's\\" may be challenged by the \\"4 C's\\": Customer solution, customer cost, convenience, and communication. * The customer looks for solutions to their problems when buying, not for products. * The customer wants to know the total cost of acquiring, using and disposing of a product, not price. * Customers want to purchase the products and services as soon as possible, not place. * Communication, not promotion: Customers prefer personalized communication with the company rather than promotion.Mars Library (05-04-2014). The marketing mix in marketing strategy: Product, price, place and promotion. Mars Library (English). marketing strategy  Process for choosing value-creating strategies  Value creation entails the integration of three different management activities: strategic management, which is focused on decisions; change management, which is about turning into new areas; and operations management, which is focused on results. These three activities are designed not only for choosing a good strategy but also for adapting to changes and creating new strategies. Successful firms are specialists in this subject. To achieve this value creation there has been created a six-step decision process that includes a dialogue between decision makers and the strategic team of the company. * First step: Assess The Business Situation: the strategy team has to evaluate a business by analyzing its life cycle (Porter's five forces analysis), value chain and the formula for success of the company. * Second step: Develop Alternatives, Information, and Value Tradeoffs: the firm creates three to seven more effective and feasible alternatives to meet new challenges. * Third Step: Evaluate the Risk and Potential Return of the Alternative: the team strategy evaluates the alternatives they have chosen by measuring value, risk timing and other factors related to them. * Fourth Step: Decide Among Alternatives: The decision board balances strategic and organizational implications along with the financial comparisons of alternatives. * Fifth and Sixth Step: plan for Action and Implementation: Step 5 is about modifying the vision of the company after having chosen the new alternatives for the implementation and Step 6 is to implement the plan of action.Samuel E. Bodily and Michael S. Allen. (1999).\\"A Dialogue process for choosing value-creating strategies\\". Interfaces, Vol 29, No. 6 , 16-28. Process value-creating strategy  Application  McDonald's has been a leader in its industry as one of the first fast food firms to enter global markets and it is now a global business. It is always adapting to changes. For example, its product line or brand-name varies between countries. In Australia, McDonald's is known as Mocca because Australians tend to abbreviate names in order to avoid pronouncing too many syllables. However, a recent study determined that its success is due to a factor that goes beyond these little details, and that is knowledge of their customers' preferences. McDonald's Strategic Competitiveness McDonald‚Äôs takes into account local tastes and preferences when developing its menu and developing a marketing strategy. The competitive advantage of McDonald's is composed of three main aspects: its prices, speed of service, and a universal taste. Its prices are affordable for most, and this is because this company is engaged in the extensive use of economies of scale so it can achieve a cost advantage. Then, it is known for its speed of service: no matter which meal the person orders, it always take the same time (3‚Äì5 minutes) to be served. Finally, a universal taste characterizes the McDonald's products line. For example, the Big Mac has the same taste almost all over the world and that provides security to those customers who travel a lot and do not like to try new food.John Dudovskiy (8-02-2016). \\"McDonald's Business Strategy and Competitive Advantage\\".

There he became a close friend of Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz, who also served in the regiment.Robert Neville Lawley. General Seydlitz, a Military Biography. W. Clowes & Sons, 1852, p. 186. During a skirmish, he and about 30 hussars were trapped at Krzanowice and forced to surrender; he enter for the first time into Austrian captivity, with several of his comrades, including Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz.Lawley, pp. 8-10. At the head of his squadron in the Second Silesian War, he fought at the battles of Hohenfriedberg, Soor, and Catholic Hennersdorf, and was promoted from the youngest Rittmeister to major during the campaign. In the last winter of the war, near Zittau, he and Seydlitz surprised the Austrian rear-guard that was plodding slowly through the back roads, attacked and routed them.Lawley, p. 17. After the autumn review of 1746, King Frederick presented him with a costly Turkish sabre as a mark of his esteem and appreciation.Lawley, p. 23. =Service in Seven Years' War= At the beginning of the Seven Years' War, he was elevated to the rank of lieutenant colonel. In addition, he was elevated to the nobility and received the Pour le M√©rite for his achievements in the Battle of Lobositz in 1756. There he took possession of Stolpen. The Austrian commandant, General Johann Adolph von Liebenau, capitulated because he saw the impossibility of defending himself. In reply to a report, King Frederick wrote Vous avez fait des merveilles, (You have done wonders). The Austrians besieged Schweidnitz in 1758, trapping Warnery and half his regiment there. When General Hartwig Karl von Wartenberg was killed on 2 May 1757 at the fighting near Prague, Warnery was promoted to colonel of Wartenberg's Hussar Regiment (later called Hussar Regiment No. 3). He was also part of the brilliant cavalry action at the error-fraught Battle of Kolin during which his and Seydlitz's cavalry, and that of Paul von Werner, prevented the Saxon army from attacking the Prussian flank.Lawley, pp. 40-41. That autumn, the Austrians besieged Schweidnitz; Warnery was trapped there with half of his regiment. In the capitulation of the fortress in the autumn of 1757, he fell into Austrian hands a second time as a prisoner of war. After his exchange, Warnery insisted on a court martial to clear his name: he was exonerated. When he requested this procedure also for the generals who were involved in the capitulation of the fortress, the courts declined. Considering this a dishonor, Warnery quit his service to Prussia and retired to his wife's estates. Military science In his retirement, Warnery found satisfaction in military writing, producing commentaries on Roman empire achievements, the development of cavalry, comparisons of Turkish and Russian tactics, and an analysis of Frederick's campaigns in the Seven Years' War. Warnery's achievements as a writer were possibly more significant than his military accomplishments. His numerous works were republished long after their composition. According to his origins in French-speaking Vaud, he wrote in the French language. One unauthorized edition first appeared in 1766 in German, so he wrote an extended edition of Remarques sur le militaire et le marine des Turcs et Russes, published in Breslau (1771). His Remarks on Cavalry of Turks and Russians appeared in English in 1798 and this is the only work translated into English. Some 19th century critics of military tactics considered his analysis of Frederick's cavalry to be among the best, but acknowledge that Warnery's opinions and analysis of cavalry units, their structure, training and tactics reflect Seydlitz's. Seydlit'z own regiment served as a basis for Warnery's analysis of cavalry.George Taylor Denison. A History of Cavalry from the Earliest Times: With Lessons for the Future.

Murif's surname at birth is unknown (possibly Murphy). In Australia, he used the spelling \\"Murif\\", but after emigrating to the USA in 1903, he adopted the spelling \\"Muriff\\". No contemporary records of the surname Murif or Muriff in Ireland exist at the period of his birth. Murif is believed to have been born in Ireland in about 1863. He appears to have arrived in Australia in about 1883. The first record of him, so far located, places him as the holder (with others) of the ABC Claim, near Waukaringa in South Australia in 1888. He later was recorded as an engine driver at the Stephens Creek reservoir of the Broken Hill Water Supply. Elsewhere there are suggestions that he was a pipe layer for the waterworks. Murif wrote occasional sketches that were published in the Barrier Miner newspaper in Broken Hill. A declaration prepared by him, after his Trans Australia journey describes him as Engineer, certificated by the Adelaide Marine Board. Aged 34, he took 74 days to complete his journey to Palmerston and Port Darwin. Murif describes a quite clinical process of investigating various records before hitting upon the bicycle crossing of Australia from South to North and selecting the appropriate bicycle, eschewing advertising and painting over the brand-name of the Wertheim Electra bicycle and labelling it Diamond. He then went on to write about his travel in the book From Ocean to Ocean, published the same year by George Robertson and Co in Sydney. He specifically avoids referencing the names of people he met during his journey, but mentions meeting a young white boy with two aborigines near Dalhousie Station, almost certainly Essington Lewis, later General Manager and Managing Director of BHP. Essington Lewis was sent to work on the family property Dalhousie during school breaks from 1896 to 1899. There is claimed to be a letter from Murif to Essington Lewis in 1898 amongst Lewis's papers, not yet referenced. Murif's bicycle being inspected by aborigines He held mineral leases in New South Wales from approximately 1898 to 1902. He left Sydney for San Francisco on the arriving on 24 March 1903, when he was described as having USD500.California, San Francisco Passenger Lists, 1893-1953 He was recorded as living in a boarding house in that city on the census date of 1 January 1920, when he was shown as 65 years old Male, White, Unmarried, born in England and working for a third party. Whilst living in San Francisco, he sought copyright on a musical composition. Murif died in San Mateo, California on 19 March 1926.California Death Index, 1905-1939 His grave is located at Holy Cross Catholic Cemetery, Colma, San Mateo County, California, USA.

The district consists of eight contributing and one non-contributing multi- family residential buildings built between 1900 and 1949. The area was designated a National Historic District and listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 2, 2008. History of the district In 1897, Cleveland resident John D. Rockefeller donated about of his personal property to the city of Cleveland. This land, which ran on either side of Doan Brook, was named Rockefeller Park, and became one of the city's premiere parks. Ansel Road was one of the major thoroughfares in the area. It ran along the western heights overlooking the broad Doan Brook valley, and was one of the areas earliest roads. It was paved in 1907, and became a heavily traveled boulevard along Rockefeller Park. With the establishment of Rockefeller Park and its gradual development over the next 30 years, Ansel Road became one of Cleveland's choicest neighborhoods. Relatively large middle-class and upper- middle-class homes were built on the west side of the street, facing the park. In 1899, the Wade Park Avenue Bridge (designed by prominent Cleveland architect Charles F. Schweinfurth) opened. This bridge carried East Boulevard (later Liberty Boulevard, and still later Wade Park Avenue) over the park, and helped to provide greater accessibility to the neighborhood. Beginning in 1910 and ending in 1928, several apartment buildings of varying size were built between Talbot Avenue and Wade Avenue. The first of these was the 1910 Overlook, a luxury three-story apartment building with units ranging from three to seven rooms in size. This was followed in 1914 by The Parkcliff, an similarly-sized structure. In 1921, as restrictions on building materials ended with the conclusion of World War I, the first of the two buildings which constituted the much larger Wade Chateau Apartments opened on Wade Park Avenue. This was followed by two large Max Weis-designed apartments (now Regency Square Apartments) around a common court in the middle of the district. Devon Hall followed in 1926 (now the Rockefeller Park Towers), anchoring the south portion of the district. A small infill apartment building, now known as The Lynette, completed construction of this unique district in 1928. * Rockefeller Park Towers, 1588 Ansel Road‚ÄîThis six-story apartment building was designed by architect Herbert Bishop Beidler for the Park Hall Improvement Company, and completed in 1926.

History Wybert Reeve c. 1880 Reeve was born in London, the only child of well-to-do parents who died when he was around five years of age, and he was placed under the guardianship of a grandfather, who appears to have been a bit of a tyrant. In this household was an old and trusted servant, who took the boy to the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, Adelphi and other London theatres, where he saw William Macready in The Tempest and the Guy Fawkes pantomime, to name two performances he recalled many years later. Around the age of 11 or 12, Reeve took to sneaking out of the house by the servants' entrance in order to witness stage productions. On one occasion he was discovered by a servant, but his intransigence was not reported to grandfather. In fact there appears to have been no love lost between Reeve and any of his family, save only an uncle, a parson of Bristol. As a young man, Reeve joined in amateur performances at the homes of friends, and thereby got to meet a son of Sir Edwin Landseer and the daughters of one Cooper, a Royal Academician, (perhaps Richard Cooper, Jr?). At age 17 a commission in either the 3rd Dragoon Guards or the 5th Dragoon Guards was procured for him, and he was stationed at the Piershill Barracks, but the regimented life of a soldier was not for him, and he resigned a year later to become an actor. The relatives were furious at his ingratitude and, apart from the vicar mentioned, broke off all contact and never saw him again. He joined a professional company under the usual conditions for an aspiring actor in those days ‚Äî no pay and provide your own wardrobe ‚Äî and was given bit parts. While staying at Bradford, where he had his first engagement, he met the actors James Anderson and Mrs. Warner, who were at the same hotel. The great tragedian earnestly advised him to abandon all thoughts of the stage; advice ignored of course. Shortly afterwards Reeve was given the part of \\"Frederick\\", the walking gentleman in The Wonder, a comedy by Susanna Centlivre. Reeve unfortunately forgot his lines, and thenceforth was reduced to walk-on non-speaking parts, with no prospect of advancement, so the aspiring \\"Hamlet\\" and \\"Young Norval\\" left and found another manager, in Whitehaven, Cumberland, under the same terms ‚Äî nothing a week and find your own wardrobe. Undeterred, Reeve continued to pursue his ambition, and steadily worked his way up the ladder. In 1852, in Plymouth, as the outcome of a bet, Reeve wrote a farce, An Australian Hoax which, to win the wager, he had in production within a week and on the stage in ten days. Gold discoveries in Australia were making the news at the time, but it is a curious fact that within a few years he would be there making his fortune, but on the stage. He wrote another farce, Supper Gratis in 1855. In that year he joined the Bath and Bristol Company, then the Theatre Royal Company at Manchester in 1857, and played four successive seasons with them. After five years of touring he decided to try his hand at stage management, and successively mounted productions at Cardiff, Swansea, Ryde, Sheffield, South Shields, and Scarborough in 1867,which he ran for two years. In October 1869 he made his first personal appearance on the London stage as \\"John Mildmay\\" in Tom Taylor's Still Waters Run Deep at the Lyceum Theatre, followed by \\"Count Fosco\\" in Wilkie Collins's The Woman in White (from the book of the same name) at the Olympic Theatre, the role for which he was best known. In 1873 he supported Collins on his reading tour of North America and appeared as Fosco on Broadway. He would eventually play the part in England, America, and the Colonies for over 2,000 nights. On 20 December 1875 Reeve opened the fine new Edinburgh Theatre on Castle Terrace, Edinburgh which he leased for two years. Productions there included grand operas with Her Majesty's Opera Company, and von Weber's Der Freisch√ºtz and other operas with the Carl Rosa Company, but was not a spectacular success, for which Reeve was blamed, and the theatre closed after eighteen months. The theatre, a venture of the Edinburgh Theatre, Winter Garden and Aquarium Company, was in 1876 sold for a fraction of its cost to the United Presbyterian Church for use as a Synod Hall, and later became a cinema. Australia In October 1878 he was brought to Melbourne by George Coppin to play \\"Count Fosco\\" and over the next two years played the part before enthusiastic audiences in all the major theatres in Australia. Another favorite of theatre-goers was his \\"Captain Wragge\\" in Great Temptation, his dramatization of Wilkie Collins's No Name. When Arthur Garner took over White's Rooms on King William Street in 1880 and remodelled it as \\"Garner's Theatre\\", he appointed Reeve as manager. In May 1885 Wybert Reeve's company performed at Abbot's Opera House in Auckland, New Zealand. The productions included Impulse!, The Woman in White and For Love or Money! by Andrew Haidley. In 1887 Reeve entered into partnership with Williamson, Garner & Musgrove as manager of the Theatre Royal, Adelaide, and around 1889 he became sole lessee of the theatre. On 19 October 1896 he hosted the first public moving picture demonstration in South Australia, a cin√©matographe Lumi√®re. Reeve occupied that position till 1900, when he retired to be succeeded by F. H. Pollock. A complimentary benefit was tendered to him by the citizens of Adelaide before he left for England: the first part of the programme was devoted to Waterloo, or the Old Veteran, a one-act play by Arthur Conan Doyle, Reeve playing Gregory Brewster, the \\"Old Veteran\\" of the title, originally written for Henry Irving. In a gracious farewell speech, he recollected with pride the improvements which he had brought to the staging of plays in Adelaide, referring to the Theatre Royal as one of the most difficult theatres in Australia to manage. He gave as his opinion that the public should support second-tier pieces by up-and-coming companies as well as the \\"hit shows\\", as only then could theatre progress. He also expressed the hope that Adelaide and the State would flourish under what to him would be the wisest and greatest advance in the history of Australia ‚Äî Federation of the Colonies. He died at his home, \\"Walmer\\", Castle Road, Newport, Isle of Wight, and was buried nearby. Author, journalist and playwright Reeve wrote an autobiography From Life, which contains reminiscences of his theatrical experiences, compiled from articles in The Australasian and other sources. He was a regular contributor to The Register on developments in English theatre. He wrote for the Victorian Review, He wrote an essay on Wilkie Collins for Chambers's Journal, the only biography of the novelist published in his lifetime. He also contributed an article entitled Sam Bough. R.S.A. in Chambers's Journal of October 30, 1902. Apart from his early farces, An Australian Hoax and Supper Gratis mentioned above, Reeve was author of the comedies Only Dust, Never Count Your Chickens, Parted, The Better Angel, I Have You, Won at Last, Not So Bad After All, Pike O'Callaghan and Obliging a Friend and dramatized Mrs. Riddell's George Geith and, with the acquiescence of Wilkie Collins, Great Temptation, his adaptation of No Name. He adapted Rosa Praed's Policy and Passion for the stage, and as Passion was first performed in 1884. Other interests Reeve not only played, but also studied Shakespeare, and it was his aim to bring about a greater appreciation of the works of \\"The Bard\\", and as manager of the Theatre Royal always aimed at the highest standards of production. He was involved with the Adelaide University Shakespeare Society in a number of ways, notably as a lecturer and critic. In a farewell speech, Sir Samuel Way said the society had been exceedingly fortunate in having had for so many years the services and advice of a man of such high culture, who had made a lifelong study of Shakespeare's works. He was a popular lecturer on subjects dear to his heart, and frequently preached from the pulpit of the Unitarian Church on Wakefield Street, Adelaide. Reeve was the first captain of the Corps of Commisionaires, a body of the citizens' militia in Adelaide, and as with the Theatre Royal, was succeeded by Pollock.

Early life James Mellon was born in February 1957 in Edinburgh, Scotland. His father is the former diplomat, Sir James Mellon, who was High Commissioner to Ghana (1978‚Äì1983), Ambassador to Denmark (1983‚Äì1986) and Consul General in New York (1986‚Äì1988). The family are distantly related to the Pittsburgh Mellon banking dynasty. He was educated at Ampleforth College and then Oriel College, Oxford where he obtained a master's degree in Politics, Philosophy and Economics. Career After university, in 1979, Mellon went to work as a trainee fund manager at Griffin Thornton (GT Management), spending six months in Hong Kong, before moving to San Francisco. Leaving with Richard Thornton in 1984 to cofound Thornton Management, Mellon returned to Hong Kong to run the company's operation there. Thornton sold for ¬£25 million four years later, making him a millionaire aged 28. He then spent two years setting-up a Hong Kong operation for Tyndall Holdings. Along with Jayne Sutcliffe in 1992, he founded Regent Pacific as an emerging markets investment vehicle, with Sir John Templeton their first customer. In 1994 came what Mellon calls his \\"first really big break\\". Having read about privatization in Russia he traveled to Vladivostok, and later Moscow, where he found Russians selling vouchers on the streets that could be swapped for stock in Russian industries. In a single day he and Sutcliffe spent $2 million in the covered markets buying the vouchers for about $25 each. A few weeks later the shares were worth $17 million. A spin-off from Regent Pacific that specialises in Eastern Europe, the fund management firm Charlemagne Capital, was also founded in the 1990s and listed on the stock market in 2006. Mellon netted ¬£55 million from his stake in the company. The 1998 Russian financial crisis was disastrous for Regent, with the value of investments in the company's Russian and East European funds becoming almost worthless, and most of its cash tied-up in local currency bonds as the rouble was devalued. When Regent Pacific acquired a stake in Hambros Bank, Mellon launched a public attack on the board's performance which preceded the break-up of the bank. This and Regent's methods of breaking-up of closed-end funds led to a 1997 Business Week article referring to him and the company's investment director, Peter Everington as \\"the Bad Boys of Emerging Markets\\". In 2009 Mellon said \\"in hindsight I was overly vociferous, and I have not done it again like that ‚Äî I‚Äôm now more behind the scenes\\". Along with Stephen Dattels, Mellon founded the uranium mining company Uramin in 2005 with just $100,000. Also listed on the stock market in 2006, it sold the following year to Areva for around ¬£1.6 billion, reportedly making him about ¬£80 million. Areva later had to accept a huge write-down in Uramin's value. He is still non-executive chairman at Regent Pacific, and the executive co-chairman of the board of Fast Forward Innovations (formerly Kuala Innovations), the non- executive chairman at Speymill Deutsche Immobilien Company PLC, Port Erin Biopharma Investments Limited and SalvaRx Group PLC (formerly 3Legs Resources). He also holds non-executive directorships at Condor Gold PLC, Bradda Head Limited (formerly Life Science Developments) and Portage Biotech Inc. He is also chairman of the Burnbrae Group. And also founder and co- chairman (along with Johnny Hon) of Mann Bioinvest. He is also chairman of Manx Financial Group PLC (the parent company of Conister Bank), of which Brexiteer Arron Banks owns 25%. Banks in 2008, also acquired a \\"notifiable interest\\", partly held by his Southern Rock Insurance group, in the gaming company Webis Holdings PLC (watchandwager.com) where Burnbrae holds a controlling stake and Sir James is a non-executive director. Mellon has said he (financially) ‚Äúhad a good day‚Äù after the Brexit vote with his trades returning almost 25 percent profit on the year. Juvenescence, a biotech company, was founded by Mellon and four others, Greg Bailey, Declan Doogan, Anthony Chow, and Alexander Pickett, in 2016. In 2018, Juvenescence raised $50 million, in a series A financing round. Mellon has invested in longevity medicine company AgeX Therapeutics and other biotechnology companies, via Juvenescence and other investment vehicles. Politics In 2009 Mellon was a leading financial backer of Prime Minister David Cameron and critical of the Labour government's \\"crazy crackdown on the non-domiciles who bring so much money and expertise into the country\\". Mellon is reportedly the man who first introduced Arron Banks to then UKIP leader Nigel Farage. He donated up to ¬£100,000 towards campaigns to leave the EU in 2015. In March 2016, Mellon said he was less ‚Äúideologically committed‚Äù to Brexit than his friend Arron Banks, and that there were ‚Äúgood arguments to be made on both sides‚Äù of what he saw as a ‚Äúnuanced‚Äù debate. In November 2016, Mellon felt that \\"Brexit is going to be a sideshow to the problems of Europe\\" and predicted that the Euro would not last, saying that \\"the euro as it stands at the moment is just a very inappropriate mechanism ‚Äî I give the euro between one and five years of life.\\" He also serves on the executive board of the Initiative for Free Trade, a London-based research foundation founded by another prominent leave-supporter Daniel Hannan MEP, after the Brexit vote, that aims to promote free trade. In July 2018, Mellon said there would be \\"a second referendum\\" that \\"remain will win\\". Philanthropy James Mellon Hall, Oriel College, Oxford Mellon made a donation to Oriel College, a constituent college of the University of Oxford, which was used to construct a purpose-built hall of residence. James Mellon hall was opened by Queen Elizabeth II in November 2000. Retrieved 15 May 2019 In May 2020, Mellon donated ¬£1 million to Oriel College to support and advance the study of longevity science. Mellon donated ¬£100,000 to the Institute of Healthy Ageing at UCL, which allowed them to purchase a structured illumination microscope system. He has also donated in excess of $25,000 to the Methuselah Foundation, which seeks to \\"help advance the fight against aging\\".

After serving in the Confederate States Army and the Virginia Senate (1863‚Äì1865), James C. Taylor won the first statewide postwar election on July 6, 1869, defeating Thomas R. Bowden who had won election four years earlier when many former Confederates were precluded from voting, or chose not to vote. Taylor later won election to the Virginia House of Delegates and served part-time for one term before losing to the man he had defeated. Early and family life The second son born to the former Mary Montgomery Craig (c.1795 ‚Äì c.1872) and her husband Creede Taylor (who moved to Montgomery County from Bedford County about 1814) received his first name to honor his maternal grandfather, who had donated 175 acres of his property (once known as Hans Meadow) to establish the town of Christiansburg in 1792. This James C. Taylor had seven siblings, including elder brother George (b. 1825), younger sisters Ann (b. 1830) and Malinda (1836‚Äì1906), and younger brothers Creed Jr., John Locke and Robert discussed below.https://www.ancestry.com/boards/localities.northam.usa.states.virginia.counties.montgomery/596.1/mb.ashx James C.

Career Admitted to the Virginia bar in October, 1850, James Craig Taylor established a private legal practice in Christiansburg, and would ultimately practice before Virginia courts at various levels, as well as federal courts. He also published a newspaper in Christiansburg, The Star, which until 1860 competed with the Whig-leaning Montgomery Messenger (later the Montgomery Herald) edited by Robert C. Trigg.Linder p. 501 In 1860, attorney James C. Taylor owned $2,500 in real estate and $4000 in personal property (which included a 30-year-old female slave); he also was training John L. Taylor to become a lawyer.1860 U.S. Federal Census for dwelling 74, family 72 in Christiansburg, Montgomery County, Virginia and federal slave schedule; the Virginia 1860 slave schedule for Christiansburg p. 108 is not available online; (the federal census misdigitized his family as \\"Faylor\\" and the same county also had James E. Taylor with different family members) Before becoming a lawyer and publisher, James Craig Taylor and his elder brother George (b. 1825) both volunteered and served in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War (1848‚Äì1849), and later both became Confederate officers during the American Civil War. On April 22, 1861, upon hearing the news that Virginia had seceded, Montgomery County citizens raised $10,000 to support the Confederate war effort and entrusted it to James C. Taylor, who invested it in county bonds. The local County Court authorized issuance of additional bonds, and also named Taylor the county treasurer.Mary Elizabeth Lindon (ed.), Virginia's Montgomery County (Christiansburg: Montgomery Museum and Lewis Miller Regional Art Center 2009) p. 66 Taylor soon raised a company (C in the 54th Virginia Infantry), and became its captain on September 10, 1861, later fighting in the Battle of Middle Creek in Kentucky and earning a promotion to Major on May 13, 1862. He was mustered out on September 20, 1862.Linden p. 91 references George C. Sherwood and Jeffery C. Weaver, 54th Virginia Infantry (Lynchburg: H.E. Howard Inc. 1993) at p. 220 All five of the Taylor brothers would fight for the Confederacy and only Creed Taylor Jr. (b. 1832 who died in a postwar duel or accident) failed to receive an officer's commission. Younger brother John Locke Taylor (1835‚Äì1911) was wounded at the Second Battle of Manassas, and his brother Robert Taylor (1838‚Äì1862) died at the Battle of Malvern Hill. In 1863, voters in Carroll, Floyd, Grayson, Montgomery and Pulaski Counties elected Taylor to represent them in the Virginia Senate, which he did until the Commonwealth's surrender.Cynthia Miller Leonard, Virginia's General Assembly 1619‚Äì1978 (Richmond: Virginia State Library 1978) pp. Taylor replaced John Calhoun Dickenson, a planter and merchant who had represented Grayson County in the Virginia General Assembly since 1853. After the war (and removal of his officeholding disabilities), Craig ran for Attorney General of Virginia on the same combined ticket as gubernatorial candidate Gilbert C. Walker, who was acceptable to both True Republicans (moderates) and the Committee of Nine, which later became the Virginia Conservative Party. On July 6, 1869, Virginia voters adopted the proposed new Constitution (minus the two clauses disenfranchising former Confederates) and James C. Taylor won 119,446 votes for Attorney General to Thomas R. Bowden's 101,029 votes, about the same majority and margin as Walker's. John F. Lewis completed (or led) the sweep over the Radical Republican ticket, winning election as lieutenant governor by defeating African American Republican J.D. Harriss 120,068 to 99,4000 votes;Richard Lowe, Republicans and Reconstruction in Virginia 1856‚Äì70 (Charlottesville: University Press of Virginia, 1991) p. 177 After the November general elections and as the U.S. House considered a bill to readmit Virginia to the Union, General Canby removed Charles Whittlesey, whom he had appointed Attorney General in September, on January 19, and appointed Taylor in his place so that his service could begin slightly earlier. The U.S. House passed a bill re-admitting Virginia to the Union on January 21, which President Grant signed and enacted into law on January 26, 1870, thus ending Congressional Reconstruction in what had been Military District No. 1.Lowe at p. 181 As attorney general, Taylor became involved in what became a decades- long controversy over funding of Virginia's prewar debt, as well as the public schools established by the new 1869 Constitution. He represented the Richmond sheriff, who refused to accept matured interest coupons in partial payment of real estate taxes in a mandamus action before the Supreme Court of Appeals (later the Virginia Supreme Court).Antoni v. Wright (citation missing in excerpt, only issuance date, December 13, 1872) The second-post-Reconstruction General Assembly had in the Funding Act of 1871 attempted to repeal the favored tax status accorded bonds issued to repay post-war debt, but in the first decision, only his mentor and Christiansburg attorney turned justice Walter Redd Staples supported the readjustment in his dissent, which argued the new bondholders had not given up anything of value (the bonds being worthless after the war because the underlying railroads and other improvements had been destroyed) and that the new state Constitution required fines paid into the old Literary Fund be expended solely for the benefit of the public schools rather than bondholders. However, on December 17, 1873, in Wise Bros &c; v. Rogers, the justices found the 1872act a constitutionally permissible change to the 1871 act.Brent Tarter, A Saga of the New South: Race, Law and Public Debt in Virginia (Charlottesville: University Press of Virginia, 2016), unpaginated excerpts without footnotes on googlebooks Taylor then resumed his private legal practice and also taught at the Montgomery Male Academy (1880), as well as sat on the board of trustees for the Montgomery Female Academy (1875,1876, 1877, 1878, 1883, and 1884). Montgomery County voters elected Taylor to represent them in the Virginia House of Delegates in 1883‚Äì1885. He thus temporarily unseated William M. Ellis.Leonard p. 530, 535, 538 Death and legacy James C.

The cavalry regiments were the largest organization units of the old Prussian mounted troops. Between 1644 and 1806, 35 cavalry regiments were gradually formed. Initially called Regiments of Horse (Regiment zu Pferde), eventually these regiments were also differentiated according to different types of troops: Cuirassier Regiment, Dragoon Regiment, Hussar Regiment. The first mounted (horse) troops were simply called cavalry, then the dragoons (mounted infantry), and the hussars only midway through the 18th century. The size of the regiments varied between the types of troops. In the course of time, the regiments also changed within a cavalry type. At the time of Frederick the Great, Cuirassier and Dragoon regiments usually consisted of five squadrons, hussar regiments of ten squadrons. In the early-modern period (up to about 1800), units bore the name of their colonels, also called the Proprietor (Inhaber). If the regiment belonged to the king or one of the princes, he had colonels who commanded the regiments for him, and the regiment bore the name of the king. After the Prussian military reorganization in 1806, the units were given numbers.  Army standard and reorganization Until 1806, all army units were garrisoned in specific towns. They could stay there for years, absent wars, and might grow old and die in their garrison. In Berlin, for example, a traveler noted that the men were so underpaid that they could barely feed themselves; consequently, they indulged in lawlessness which their officers either could not or did not prevent.Adam Neale, Travels through some parts of Germany, Poland, Moldavia and Turkey, 1818, p. 60-61.

A sequel to 2013's Risk of Rain, it was released in early access for Microsoft Windows, and Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in 2019 before fully releasing on August 11, 2020. It was announced on September 12, 2020 that the game would have its version 1.0 released on Stadia with a new temporary exclusive map \\"Sundered Grove\\", the release date for Stadia is September 29, 2020. Players control a survivor who is stranded on an alien planet. To survive, they navigate through various environments, killing monsters and looting chests to collect items that boost their offensive and defensive capabilities. Over time, the game's difficulty increases, spawning more powerful and dangerous creatures. The game supports up to four players in online multiplayer. The game received generally positive reviews upon release. Gameplay Risk of Rain 2 follows a similar approach as the first title, in which one to four players must progress several levels while killing enemies. On each level the goal is to locate a teleporter, randomly located on the level; once activated, the players must defend themselves from an onslaught of aliens, including bosses until the teleporter is fully active. Killing aliens gains experience and currency; the currency can be used to open chests that randomly drop items on the level. These collectible items offer a wide range of boosts to the players carrying them and provide both synergistic effects and the potential to stack their effects if multiple copies of the same items are acquired. However, the strength, difficulty, and numbers of aliens increase every five minutes, thus making the game harder the longer the players stay on any level. In the metagame, players unlock access to new playable characters, items, and game modifiers by completing certain in-game achievements; once unlocked, new characters or modifiers are available to select from at the start of the game, or the new items can start appearing randomly in-game. Risk of Rain 2 features several of the same playable characters, creatures, and items from the first game, but transitions the game from 2D to a 3D environment. Development On the transitioning of the series from 2D to 3D, Hopoo Games noted that the 3D option provided \\"much deeper design spaces and more possibilities for cool gameplay\\" as well as more ways to artistically express themselves. When they started development on the sequel, Hopoo started with a 2D-based prototype with the player in control of one of the monsters in the first game, as to mix up the formula for the sequel. Part of the addition for this was inspired by Risk of Rain fan art that showed the various objects the player collected shown on the character, and Hopoo wanted to use this approach for the sequel, but the 2D graphic approach did not give them enough visual space to work with. They transitioned the prototype from 2D to 2.5D, representing the character in 3D graphics but otherwise playing as a 2D platformer, but when they completed that, they felt it was better to move the game fully to 3D, with the transition being relatively quick to complete. The game was first announced the sequel in May 2017, at which time the team had been working on the game over the previous 6 months. . The sequel uses the Unity engine, which Hopoo had to learn for this, as well as the time in developing the 3D worlds. In designing some of the returning monsters Hoppo noted that they had to design new attacks to make them more challenging in a 3D space. . Items similarly had to be redesigned to deal with the dimension change. Hopoo released the game into early access on Windows on March 27, 2019, at the time they estimated that the full development process they would take another year. During the early access period, Hopoo signed with Gearbox Publishing to release the game on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. It was also released in early access for those platforms on August 30, 2019. Its full release was initially scheduled for Q2 2020 but was delayed in order to expand the scope of its 1.0 update. Release The game was released out of early access for Microsoft Windows on August 11, 2020. It was released for Stadia on September 29, 2020 with a timed exclusive level. The Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One are scheduled to receive the 1.0 update by the end of 2020. Reception On its launch into early access, Hopoo Games offered Risk of Rain 2 with a \\"buy one, get one free\\" promotion for the first few days. A week from release, Hopoo announced that over 650,000 players had played the game, with about 150,000 of those having taken advantage of the special promotion. Within a month of the game's early access release, it had sold over a million copies.

The lexicon is a word bank developed by professional taste testers in order to identify an objective, nuanced and cross-cultural word bank for food. Background Flavor is the sensory impression of food or other substances and is determined primarily by the chemical senses of taste and smell. Flavor is said to be 80 percent aroma, detected primarily through the retronasal smell mechanism. Sight, sound, and touch also impact flavor. The color of a food, sound as one bites into it, and texture are all factors that contribute to a person‚Äôs perception of food. In addition, culture provides a context to food. All these experiences put together can affect a person‚Äôs description of the food item. Flavor lexicons seek to provide an objective word bank for food. This streamlines the variations created by the different language ascribed to food. The development of flavor language allows tasters to pinpoint descriptions about the food they taste. There are three major descriptive analysis techniques used by professional taste testers: Flavor Profile Method (FPM); Quantitative Descriptive Analysis (QDA); and the Spectrum method. Taste testing In developing a flavor lexicon, the tongue is a taster‚Äôs instrument. A taster is trained to remain objective. The first documented descriptive analysis technique, FPM, was first implemented in the 1950s. The structure of FPM is also the simplest of the three ‚Äî fewer panelists are employed with a minimum of four. Following a 60-hour training session, panel members work together to develop a consensus profile of the taste properties and their intensities on a four-point scale. QDA features a sensory professional leading 8 to 12 prescreened individuals who make up the panel. The professional orders the evaluation of each descriptor. His or her panel defines the scales by judging the attributes. The significance of their findings is analyzed through statistical tests. While panel sizes for the Spectrum Method are similar to that of QDA, tasters for the Spectrum Method require more screening for cognitive, descriptive, and sensory discrimination screening ability, interest, and availability. Development of taste characteristics A requirement for a robust taste lexicon is for the characteristics to be discriminating and descriptive. For the trait to be descriptive, it must represent the range of variabilities an understanding of the food can present. Contrastly, it must also pinpoint what differentiates the food item from other foods. Thus, the descriptors must be clear, precise, and nonredundant. That is, though there are no restrictions on the number of terms belonging to a flavor lexicon, multiple terms should not describe one flavor and one term should not multiple flavors. A number of associations can aid a taster in conceptualizing the food. First, panelists can link two words together such as ‚Äúcharcoal‚Äù and ‚Äúburnt.‚Äù This creates a heuristic so that foods with charcoal undertones are also linked with the word burnt. Oftentimes, multiple references are recommended to communicate a ‚Äúconcept‚Äù and can relay information better to certain panelists. Cultural differences can also affect how food and flavor is perceived and described. Awareness can eliminate some confusion, but the use of flavor language can also eliminate some of the language/cultural barriers that may occur. Application Flavor lexicons have proven to be especially important in wine-tasting. Professional wine tasters (sommeliers) use specific language to denote a wine‚Äôs perceived flavors, aromas, and general characteristics as a way to sell the wine in the wide market. Researcher MaryAnne Drake and team sought to standardize the language surrounding cheddar cheese. A list of 240 names belonging to cheddar cheese were collected, but using the Spectrum method, 27 terms were selected. In 2016, Kansas State University researchers identified 110 aromas and tastes associated with the flavor of coffee. The coffee ‚Äúdictionary‚Äù pinpoints exact dimensions of the flavor, though it remains a work in progress.

The incident led to closure of the fraternity's chapter at the university and, , at least 26 members of the fraternity face charges, including involuntary manslaughter.  Hazing incident  Piazza was a 19-year-old sophomore engineering student at Pennsylvania State University. He was a pledge of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity at the university. On the night of February 2, 2017, while undergoing hazing activities for the fraternity, Piazza, on an essentially empty stomach, drank large amounts of alcohol in a short time as part of an obstacle course called \\"The Gauntlet\\", which required each pledge to drink from a bottle of vodka, drink a beer, and finally drink from a bag of wine. It later was revealed that Piazza took prescription anti-depressants, which contributed to his inebriation. The fraternity was supposed to be alcohol-free after a suspension in 2009. In this state of intoxication, he fell on the basement stairs of the house and was knocked unconscious. He was carried to a couch, where surveillance cameras captured a conspicuous bruise that bloomed on his left abdomen, however, this was shown to have originated from another one of the alcohol-fueled rush events for fraternities that Piazza had attended a week earlier. Some time later, Piazza regained consciousness and rolled off the couch. Three brothers picked him up and placed him back on the couch. Security footage shows them poking Piazza in the face, to determine if he was okay, but he remained unconscious and unresponsive. A newly initiated fraternity chapter member attempted to render aid to Piazza, encouraging fraternity members to call 911 and get an ambulance to the house. He was shoved up against a wall and his attempts were ignored. At around 3:30 A.M on February 3, 2017, Piazza tried to get up, but once he reached a standing position, fell backward. He continued to stand up only to repeatedly fall back down. Once he was finally able to maintain balance, he staggered toward the lobby area of the house, but fell again headfirst into an iron railing and landed on a stone floor, likely incurring serious head trauma. He got up and tried to reach the front door but fell headfirst into it, knocking himself unconscious again. He later tried once more to ascend the basement stairs and was missing until several of the fraternity brothers discovered him several hours later behind the bar in the basement, cold and breathing rapidly. It was at this point that he was carried upstairs. After several minutes of debating on what the next step should be, the conclusion was made that Piazza's injuries were indeed serious and that he would require medical attention. Before emergency assistance arrived, the brothers wiped blood from his face and attempted to dress him in effort to warm him. Soon emergency services arrived and Piazza was brought to Mount Nittany Medical Center, but was quickly transported to Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center because of the severity of his injuries. Upon arrival, Piazza was rushed into surgery, where he was discovered to have a ruptured spleen and class IV hemorrhagic shock. His brain had swollen to the point that roughly half of his skull had to be removed to relieve the pressure. The surgeons attempting to save his life deemed the injuries to likely be nonrecoverable, and Piazza was pronounced dead in the early morning of February 4, 2017. He is estimated to have had a blood alcohol content of nearly 0.40 on the night of the hazing incident.  Criminal prosecutions  The Piazza case resulted in one of the largest hazing prosecutions in US history. On May 5, 2017, following a grand jury investigation, eighteen members of the fraternity were charged in connection with Piazza's death: eight were charged with involuntary manslaughter and the rest with other offenses, including hazing. In addition to the fraternity brothers, the Beta Theta Pi fraternity itself was also charged. Its Penn State fraternity branch was closed after its president ordered it banned from campus indefinitely. , the fraternity and its eighteen members faced a combined total of more than 850 criminal charges. = Alleged perpetrators = Prosecutors have filed the following charges in relation to this crime and its cover-up: * Daniel Casey (age 19): 201 counts, including involuntary manslaughter; charges reduced to reckless endangerment, hazing, and furnishing alcohol to a minor * Brendan Young (age 21): 200 counts, including involuntary manslaughter; charges reduced to reckless endangerment, hazing, and furnishing alcohol to a minor * Jonah Neuman (age 19): 79 counts, including involuntary manslaughter; charges reduced to reckless endangerment, hazing, and furnishing alcohol to a minor * Nick Kubera (age 19): more than 50 counts, including involuntary manslaughter; charges reduced to hazing and furnishing alcohol to a minor * Craig Heimer (age 21): 52 counts, including reckless endangerment; charges reduced to furnishing alcohol to a minor * Lars Kenyon (age 19): 52 counts, including reckless endangerment; charges reduced to furnishing alcohol to a minor * Michael Schiavone (age 21): 52 counts, including reckless endangerment; charges reduced to hazing and furnishing alcohol * Ryan Foster (age 21): one count of tampering with evidence * Edward Gilmartin (age 20): one count of tampering with evidence Tampering with evidence and endangerment charges have also been dismissed against three other students, Joseph Ems, Ryan McCann, and Lucas Rockwell. On November 14, 2017, ten more members were charged in connection with Piazza's death. The new charges were filed after the Centre County District Attorney announced that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had recovered video showing that Piazza had been given at least 18 drinks in an 82-minute span, and that the video had been intentionally deleted. The additional defendants are:http://www.philly.com/archive/jeremy_roebuck/penn- state-hazing-death-piazza-case-new-details-20171113.html * Joshua Kurczewski (age 19): eight counts; including involuntary manslaughter, hazing, and furnishing alcohol to a minor * Ryan Burke (age 21): eight counts; including involuntary manslaughter, hazing, and furnishing alcohol to a minor; pleaded guilty on June 13, 2018 * Jonathan Kanzler (age 19): eight counts; including involuntary manslaughter, hazing, and furnishing alcohol to a minor * Aiden O'Brien: eight counts; including involuntary manslaughter, hazing, and furnishing alcohol to a minor * Brian Gelb: three counts; including hazing, furnishing alcohol to a minor, and unlawful acts relative to liquor * Patrick Jackson: three counts; including hazing, furnishing alcohol to a minor, and unlawful acts relative to liquor * Reggie Goeke: three counts; including hazing, furnishing alcohol to a minor, and unlawful acts relative to liquor * Mike Fernandez: three counts; including hazing, furnishing alcohol to a minor, and unlawful acts relative to liquor * Donald Prior: three counts; including hazing, furnishing alcohol to a minor, and unlawful acts relative to liquor Ems (age 19) now has additional charges against him‚Äîhazing, furnishing alcohol to a minor, and unlawful acts relative to liquor. Braxton Becker (age 20), who had the charge of tampering with evidence dropped against him, was charged with it again (and later acquitted) after new footage suggested he deleted the footage that lead to these new charges. Becker was also charged with (and acquitted of) obstructing administration of law and charged with (and convicted of) hindering apprehension. , at least 26 members face charges. = Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Beta Theta Pi - Alpha Upsilon et al. = On August 11, 2017, on the fifth day of the preliminary hearing, it was announced by lead investigators that basement footage from the bid acceptance on February 2, 2017, had in fact been deleted by a defendant already charged in the case. Lead prosecutor Stacy Parks Miller noted that additional charges would be filed as a result of this finding. That same day, defense attorneys for a number of the defendants started to put blame on Tim Bream, the Penn State Nittany Lions football head athletic trainer and Beta Theta Pi live-in advisor. He was present during the night of Tim Piazza's bid acceptance, although he has never been charged in the case. After unsuccessful attempts by attorneys to have Bream subpoenaed, the judge in the case ordered that Bream have his own hearing on possible contempt of court and avoiding his subpoena.  Guilty plea  One of the fraternity brothers charged in the death of Piazza pleaded guilty on June 13, 2018, to nine charges, making him the first in the case to enter a guilty plea. Ryan Burke, age 21, pleaded guilty to four counts of hazing and five counts relating to unlawful acts involving liquor in the deadly injuries Piazza sustained following a night of heavy drinking and hazing. Burke was accused of giving Piazza a bottle of vodka at the Beta Theta Pi party. Burke admitted his role in the hazing of Piazza, which included being present for and actively encouraging a gauntlet of drinking games and an obstacle course involving Piazza and other pledges.Penn State ex-frat brother makes first guilty plea in hazing death of 19-year-old pledge On July 31, 2018, Burke was sentenced to three months of house arrest for his role in the hazing death of Piazza. He pleaded guilty to nine misdemeanor charges, including four counts of hazing and five counts involving unlawful acts related to alcoholic beverages. In addition to the house arrest, Burke was sentenced to 27 months of probation and was ordered to pay fines, costs, and restitution.Ex-Penn State Fraternity Member Sentenced to House Arrest in Hazing Death  The Timothy J. Piazza Anti-Hazing Law  On March 27, 2018, \\"The Timothy J. Piazza Anti-Hazing Law\\" was unanimously approved by the Pennsylvania State Senate Judiciary Committee. Pennsylvania Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman (Republican, Benner Township) and Piazza's parents, Jim and Evelyn Piazza, introduced the bill on March 23, 2018, at the courthouse in Bellefonte. The bill would create tiers for hazing. Hazing resulting in serious bodily injury or death would be a third-degree felony, which could include fines of up to $15,000 and imprisonment up to seven years. Hazing resulting in bodily injury would be a third-degree misdemeanor, which could include fines of up to $2,500 and imprisonment up to one year. Other hazing would be a summary offense. The bill would also establish \\"organizational\\" and \\"institutional\\" hazing categories. \\"The bill has been carefully crafted because we want this to be a model for changing anti-hazing laws nationwide,\\" Corman said. \\"My intent with this legislation is clear to prevent death or serious injury due to hazing so that families, such as Tim's, never experience tragedies like this ever again.\\" The anti-hazing legislation was subsequently submitted for consideration in the full state Senate.Tim Piazza anti-hazing law unanimously approved by Pa. Senate committee On April 18, 2018, the Pennsylvania State Senate unanimously passed the bill, which would make hazing in fraternities a third-degree felony in cases of serious injury or death, and could allow universities to seize offending Greek organizations' houses. The law is sponsored by Republican Senate Majority Leader and 34th Senatorial District Rep. Jake Corman, who worked with Tim Piazza's family to create the bill. It defines hazing as coercing an individual to participate in any illegal activity in order to join a social group, including the use of drugs and alcohol to inflict physical or emotional harm or the use of other forces such as \\"whipping, beating ... or extreme embarrassment\\". Lawmakers named the anti-hazing legislation after Timothy Piazza.Pennsylvania Senate passes anti- hazing law  See also  * Beta Theta Pi Incidents * List of hazing deaths in the United States * Matt's Law  References   Further reading  * * Penn State frat pledge's skin had turned gray by morning after fall, prosecutor says * A Penn State student fell down the stairs at a fraternity ‚Äî and for nearly 12 hours, no one called police * Fraternity, 18 members charged in Penn State student‚Äôs death * 18 Penn State Students Charged in Fraternity Death * Swofford, Justin J.

Best known for her oversized charcoal drawings of humans and animals, her aesthetic came from journalistic photography and her work relies on strong draftsmanship and powerful compositions with great psychological depth. Hellen Cullinan of the Cleveland Plain Dealer said of Szalay's work, \\"Powerfully expressive gestural and facial closeup details reflect Szalay's command of behavioral and physical characteristics.\\" For the span of her almost 40 year career as a fine artist, Szalay was an instructor of life drawing at every major art institution in Northeast Ohio. Education Marilyn Szalay, born in Cleveland, Ohio grew up and attended public school in Rocky River, Ohio. She earned her Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1972 and Master of Fine Arts in 1975 from the Kent State University thumbnailChildhood Dreams Marilyn Szalay Collection of Artists Archives of the Western Reserve Quote ‚ÄúI am floored by the depth of form she achieves in charcoal, and love that her figures are larger than life size. Using only shades of gray, she models a face to come all the way out beyond the picture plane. And then she continues the construction and places a beautifully sculpted three-dimensional nose to sit on it.‚Äù Judy Tak√°cs, Curator for ‚ÄúMajority Rising: Cleveland's Female Gaze‚Äù, Artists Archives of the Western Reserve, Biography After matriculating with a BFA and MFA from Kent State University, Marilyn Szalay began her art career in the late 1970s as a photo journalist for the Sun Newspapers in Cleveland, Ohio. She maintained a purity and integrity for the art form of traditional 35mm black and white photography, processing and printing her own film and enlargements in her home darkroom. Always working on location with natural light, she rarely used a flash and never made enhancements and corrections in the darkroom. A stickler for the integrity of the rectangular view she composed in the camera viewfinder, she wouldn't even crop an image in the darkroom. Her photographic compositions were also psychologically compelling. Photographer, Dave Dreimiller writes: ‚ÄúTechnically Lynn was a master of light and shadow as well as composition. But there was something much deeper in her photos. They often captured a mood that seemingly reflected her mental state at that moment. Lynn was conflicted and you can read this in her images: sometimes soft and gentle, other times ripped by a feeling of stark grittiness. Her photos often evoked darkness and ultimately sadness; full of emotion yet utterly devoid of joy or happiness. The use of run down old buildings as backdrops further accentuated the forlorn quality in her images. An enduring aspect of Lynn's work was the ability to fit the facial expression and pose of her model with its environment. It provides a sense that the subject somehow belongs there, and makes the images feel more cohesive. One can see this time and again in Lynn's work.‚Äù Her photographic sensibilities influenced her large scale charcoal drawings. Her process began with an 8 x 10 photograph she had taken as reference for the drawing. She would draw the composition on paper without use of grids, projection or a transfer process. From that point she would, as Dave Dreimiller writes, ‚Äúdefine contours and fill in tones [‚Ä¶] Work on this drawing went on night and day until it was completed. The finished drawing had even greater impact than the original photo. The sheer size was impressive, and the drawing somehow conveyed more depth and dimension than the photograph from which it was based.‚Äù Her work has been exhibited at the Cleveland Museum of Art, Cleveland Institute of Art, Butler Institute of American Art, Erie Art Museum, Case Western Reserve University, Canton Art Museum, SPACES, John Carrol University, Mount Union College, and the Cleveland Clinic. Szalay has participated in the Lakeland Community College annual ‚Äúfrom WOMAN‚Äù exhibitions during her lifetime and posthumously. In 2013, the \\"from WOMAN VI\\" exhibition was dedicated to Marilyn Szalay by curator Mary Urbas, who used her drawing, \\"Self-Portrait with Frog\\" on the poster. Urbas, who has also consistently exhibited Szalay's work in her bi-annual Skull and Skeleton Show describes Szalay as ‚Äúincredibly prolific.‚Äù Szalay's drawings have won awards from the Butler Institute of American Art., Jewish Community Center and The Cleveland Museum of Art Cleveland May Show Szalay's work is part of the permanent collections of MetroHealth Medical Center, Akron Children's Hospital, The Plain Dealer Publishing Company, The Cleveland Zoological Society, Kent State University, The Jewish Community Center and Ronald Macdonald House. In 2014 Marilyn Szalay‚Äôs work was permanently archived in the collection of The Artists Archives of the Western Reserve. The Artists Archives is an archival facility and regional museum that preserves representative bodies of work created by Ohio visual artists and, through ongoing research, exhibition and educational programs, actively documents and promotes this cultural heritage for the benefit of the public. Her work was curated posthumously by Judy Tak√°cs into the Artists Archives of the Western Reserve group exhibition, \\"Majority Rising: Cleveland's Female Gaze\\" along with the work of Shirley Aley Campbell, Kathleen McKenna, Lee Heinen and Marsha Sweet. This exhibition was also featured in the Collective Arts Network (CAN) Journal and in Cleveland Scene Magazine. Her work was published by American Artist Magazine in 2000 as part of \\"Realism Today,\\" a national juried competition with a physical show was at the John Pence Gallery in San Francisco. She was regularly featured in \\"Dialogue, An Art Journal\\" from 1985 to 1983, and her work was reviewed multiple times by the Cleveland Plain Dealer. Her charcoal drawings were featured on the Women Drawing Women online journal, a subset of the Women Painting Women Movement. During her 40 years as a figurative artist, Marilyn Szalay was a life drawing instructor at each major art and educational institution in Northeast Ohio, including Kent State University, Cuyahoga Community College, Virginia Marti College of Fashion and Art, Cooper School of Art, Cleveland State University and Cleveland Institute of Art. Her reputation as a tough teacher who didn't mince words, was chronicled by a student, Brian W. Fairbanks, to whom she taught life drawing at Cuyahoga Community College. Fairbanks writes, ‚ÄúLife Drawing went exceptionally well today. Not once did the teacher berate or mock my drawings, as she is often inclined to do.‚Äù ‚Äì Journal entry, Tuesday February 2, 1990. Art Tangible and Intangible and Childhood Dreams are characteristic of Szalay's work in that they portray young children in psychologically complex settings. Masks, dolls, skulls and horns are common motifs in her charcoal drawings, as are settings in playgrounds and cemeteries. Timmy is a portrait of a mountain gorilla, representative of Szalay's work with the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo as an artist, volunteer and docent. In 1993, Plain Dealer critic Helen Cullinan praised Szalay's drawings of a chimpanzee, orangutan and gorilla for the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo: ‚ÄúPowerfully expressive gestural and facial closeup details reflect Szalay‚Äôs command of behavioral and physical characteristics.‚Äù Selected exhibitions * Majority Rising, Cleveland‚Äôs Female Gaze, curated by Judy Tak√°cs, Artists Archives of the Western Reserve, Cleveland, Ohio, 2015 *From Woman VI (Dedicated to Marilyn Szalay) VII, VIII, IX and X, curated by Mary Urbas, Lakeland Community College, Kirtland, Ohio *Three Visions, curated by Mary Urbas, Negative Space Gallery, Cleveland, Ohio *Hungarians at the Easel, invitational show, Cleveland Artists Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio, 2003 *Drawings, Massillon Museum, Massillon, Ohio, 2003 *Annual Midyear Juried Show, 1999, 2001 Awarded, 2003, Butler Institute of American Art, Youngstown, Ohio *Marilyn Szalay Drawings, solo show, Lakeland Community College, Kirtland, Ohio 1997 *May Show, Cleveland Museum of Art, Cleveland, Ohio, 1985 Awarded, 1986, 1990 *Mauersberger and Szalay, duo show, Cuyahoga Community College, Cleveland, Ohio 1987 *Drawings, Traveling Exhibition; SPACES, Cleveland, Ohio; Contemporary Art Center, Cincinnati, Ohio; Southern Ohio Museum and Cultural Center, Portsmouth, Ohio, 1984 Awards *2001 Juror's Mention Award, 65th Annual Midyear Juried Show, Butler Institute of American Art, Youngstown, Ohio *1992 Simpson Award of Excellence, Gorilla Giver Brochure, Cleveland, Ohio *1990 Purchase Award, Jewish Community Center, Cleveland, Ohio *1989 Cash Award, Six State Photography *1987 Purchase Award, A New Generation of Ohio Artists *1985 Cash Award for Graphics, May Show, Cleveland Museum of Art, Cleveland, Ohio Publications *Women Drawing Women, ‚ÄúMarilyn Szalay‚Äù, September 14, 2011 *American Artist Magazine, \\"Realism Today\\", November 2000 *University of Akron Catalog, \\"Drawing in Ohio at the Turn of the Century\\", 1995 *Pilgrim Press Daily Calendar, \\"In Good Company\\", 1996, 1997 *The Plain Dealer, Cleveland, Ohio, June 1985, January 9, 1986, September 14, 1986, November 5, 1986, July 1993 *Dialogue: An Art Journal, May/June 1981, March/April 1984, January/February 1986, May/June 1986, November/December 1986 Selected permanent collections * MetroHealth Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio * Akron Children's Hospital, Akron, Ohio * The Plain Dealer Publishing Company, Cleveland, Ohio * Key Corp National Bank, Cleveland, Ohio * Ronald McDonald House, Cleveland, Ohio * The Cleveland Zoological Society, Cleveland, Ohio * Jones, Day, Reavis, & Pogue, Cleveland, Ohio * Kent State University, Kent, Ohio * The Jewish Community Center, Cleveland, Ohio * Myers and Company, Cleveland, Ohio * Steven Paternite, Akron, Ohio See also * Classical Realism * Contemporary Realism * Portrait Painting * Post-contemporary * Women artists References Category:American women painters Category:American contemporary artists Category:20th-century American painters Category:21st-century American painters Category:Modern painters Category:Artists from Cleveland Category:1950 births Category:2012 deaths Category:20th-century American women artists Category:21st-century American women artists ","title":"Marilyn Szalay"},{"id":"53997274","text":"Nelson Lake is located south of Minnehaha, New York.

Byrne was born in Uphall, West Lothian, to Irish parents John Byrne, a shale miner, and Catherine Doonan, who were married in Broxburn in 1900. Byrne worked as an electrician and joined the Electrical Trades Union (ETU). He became the union's Glasgow area secretary, a post he held for eighteen years. In 1948, he stood to become assistant general secretary of the union, losing to Frank Haxell, a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB).\\"Mr John T.

However, it was declared that he had narrowly lost the election. He and Frank Chapple took Haxell and fourteen other CPGB members to court, alleging that the election had been fixed. In 1961, they won the case and the court declared Byrne elected as general secretary. Byrne expelled Haxell from the union but did not agree to a Trades Union Congress (TUC) demand to bar all existing officers from office for five years. As a result, the ETU were expelled from the TUC and, later, also from the Labour Party. Byrne organised new elections and was re-elected as general secretary, with his supporters winning almost all the elected posts.

The law had no mechanism for the National Council to operate without a president, and Engelbert Dollfuss, the Chancellor, stated that Parliament had eliminated itself and that his government had the authority to rule by decree under emergency provisions dating from the First World War. This was a decisive step in the transition from a democratic republic to the fascist Federal State of Austria, as opposition attempts to reconstitute the National Council were unsuccessful.  Events of March 4, 1933  When railway workers learned that their salaries were going to be paid in three installments, they went on strike on Wednesday, March 1, 1933. This was the subject of the heated debate in the National Council on March 4, 1933. There were three proposals. The proposal from the Christian Social Party, which was the majority at the time, was to impose disciplinary measures. The Greater German People's Party (GDVP) and the Social Democratic Workers' Party of Austria (SDAP√ñ) were both against disciplinary measures in their proposals. The proposal of the Social Democrats had 70 yes votes and 92 no votes and was therefore rejected. The proposal of the GDVP, however, was accepted with 81 yes votes and 80 no votes. At 8:40 pm the session was interrupted and then continued at 9:35 pm. After the session was resumed, the president and Chairman of the National Council Karl Renner, who was a Social Democrat, announced that the vote had some irregularities because of the Members and , who were both Social Democrats. It turned out that Abram cast one ballot for himself and another ballot, which carried Abram's name, for Scheibein, who was not in the room at the time when the voting process occurred. This resulted in an uproar and the Christian Socials demanded a new vote. Karl Renner, who saw himself incapable of continuing the session, resigned as president of the National Council to also be able to participate in next vote and therefore secure an additional vote for the Social Democrats. The second president Rudolf Ramek, a Christian Social, took over as Chairman. He declared that the previous vote was invalid and demanded that the vote should be repeated. This resulted in another uproar. Ramek stepped down as president and the third president Sepp Straffner from the GDVP became Chairman of the National Council before immediately stepping down. The resignation of Renner, Ramek and Straffner left the house without a speaker. Therefore, the session could not be closed and the National Council was incapable of acting. The Members left the chamber as consequence.  Dollfuss's interpretation  The events of March 4, 1933 were an unexpected help for Dollfuss, who intended to rule as an authoritarian. Dollfuss declared that the parliament had \\"eliminated itself\\" and that this situation was a crisis \\"not provided for in the constitution\\". This gave the Chancellor the opportunity to establish an authoritarian government without a parliament. What appeared to be a \\"self- elimination of parliament\\" was, in fact, a coup d'√©tat, since Dollfuss was determined to ensure that the National Council would never come together again. On March 7, the federal government stated that it was not affected by the crisis and declared itself in power. It then announced that the \\"Wartime Economy Authority Law\\", an emergency law that was passed in 1917, would be used as a basis to rule. The first section of this law reads as follows: > The government is empowered for the duration of the extraordinary conditions > brought about by the war to make provision through decree for the necessary > measures for promoting and revitalizing economic activities, for warding off > economic damages, and supplying the population with food and other > necessities.  Events of March 15, 1933  On March 15, 1933, the Greater German People's Party and the Social Democratic Workers' Party of Austria (SDAP√ñ) of Austria, which formed the opposition at that time, tried to continue the session that was aborted on March 4. They were, however, stopped by the police by order of the government and threatened the use of armed force. The resigning and third president of the National Council of the GDVP, Sepp Straffner, canceled his own withdrawal and was sitting with Members of the National Council for the SDAP and GDVP in the parliamentary chamber. The other Members of the National Council were not allowed in the parliament, which was surrounded by the law enforcement. The Members who were already in the parliament were escorted out by the police.  Role of Austrian President Wilhelm Miklas  Over a million people signed a petition to ask then sitting Austrian President Wilhelm Miklas to recall the government of Dollfuss and initiate new elections to reinstate the National Council. The constitution gave Miklas the power to do so. However, the president did not act, which allowed Dollfuss to continue his dictatorial reign.  Aftermath  The liquidation of the Parliament furthered political tensions in the country. On 12 February 1934 SDAP√ñ and its paramilitary wing (Republikanischer Schutzbund) started an armed rebellion against Dolfuss, which was later joined by the Communist Party of Austria (KP√ñ), which had already been banned by the government in 1933 and was operating underground. The rebellion was quickly crushed by Austrian Armed Forces and CS's paramilitary forces (Heimwehr and Ostm√§rkische Sturmscharen) and SDAP√ñ and its affiliated trade unions were banned by the government. In the following months, all political parties except the Christian Social Party were dissolved and the democratic Constitution was replaced by a corporatist constitution modelled along the lines of Benito Mussolini's fascist Italy (austrofascism). The Fatherland Front was later established, merging the Christian Social Party and right-wing paramilitary militia, establishing a one-party state which lasted until Austrian annexation into the German Reich in 1938.  Legacy  To ensure that the parliament would never \\"eliminate itself\\" again, a new law was introduced in 1975 that would give the position of Chairman to the oldest Member of the National Council, if the three presidents were not able to execute their duties as Chairmen.

Education Wang graduated from National Kangshan Senior High School in Gangshan District, Kaohsiung. Career In the early 2000s, Wang served as secretary general of the League of Welfare Organizations for the Disabled and was the spokesperson of the Pan-Purple Coalition. From the latter position in 2003, Wang supported Chien Hsi-chieh's presidential campaign. After Chien had left the race, Wang was invited to take part in Taiwan's first televised presidential debate, between Chen Shui-bian and Lien Chan, as one of five questioners. He was named a Democratic Progressive Party legislative candidate later that year and elected via party list proportional representation. Two months after taking office, Wang advocated for the government to investigate the amount of mercury used in imported batteries from elsewhere in Asia. As a legislator, Wang also continued advocating for the rights of people with disabilities. He accused Fubon Securities of discrimination against a person with hearing loss in 2006, and protested police actions in an arrest of a person with mental disabilities in 2007. Following the incident, Wang worked to pass amendments to the Mental Health Act relating to care and medical treatment of people with mental disabilities. Wang stepped down at the end of his legislative term in January 2008 and later that year, became the secretary general for the League of Social Welfare Organizations in Taiwan. Between June 2008 and December 2009, Wang was a member of the Executive Yuan Tax Reform Committee. By 2010, Wang was leading the Alliance for Fair Tax Reform. While with the group, Wang criticized the Council of Labor Affairs for spending money on nonessential acquisitions in the midst of budget cuts. After Control Yuan President Wang Chien-shien stated in 2010 that students who work while studying at university were \\"stupid,\\" Wang Jung-chang challenged him to help keep tuition costs down and lessen economic inequality. The next year, Wang drew attention to Taiwan's increasing budget deficit. The Ministry of Finance invited Wang to participate in a task force considering taxation and finance issues in March 2012. He stated that the finance ministry's 2012 bill to reform security gains tax benefited the rich over the poor and made it difficult to consider other tax reform. Wang also resumed his position with the League of Welfare Organizations for the Disabled. In 2013, he brought attention to a case of discrimination on the basis of disability, when police were called to escort a woman with Down syndrome out of a McDonald's restaurant in Kaohsiung. After this incident, Wang pushed for Taiwan to formally sign the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Wang served as an advisor to Wellington Koo's 2014 Taipei mayoral campaign. He opposed a 2015 proposal to cut Taiwan's transaction tax rate, stating that the cut would increase economic inequality. Wang called for pension reform instead, supporting extensive and centralized review of the system, stating that without such a review, the separate pension funds would go bankrupt in the coming decades. He was placed on the proportional representation ballot for the second time in 2015, and returned to the Legislative Yuan. Wang signed on in support of a 2016 amendment to the Act of Gender Equality in Employment, which made it possible for both married and unmarried parents to claim family leave. He suggested that retirement age for Taiwanese schoolteachers be raised to 65 later that year, and drew criticism from the National Federation of Education Unions. Wang was named to the Legislative Yuan Finance Committee in September 2016, and retained his position in February 2017. In June 2020, Wang was nominated by the Tsai Ing-wen presidential administration to serve on the Control Yuan.

The production of the film started in the March of 2009, when Adler Yang was 14 years old, studying at the Humanity (RenWen) Junior High School as a grade 8 student. The film was theatrically released in Taiwan and Hong Kong since August 2016 by crowdfunding, screening at major theaters in Taipei, Taoyuan, Taichung, Kaohsiung, Yilan, Kowloon, etc. The film has also been selected in more than 10 film festivals internationally, receiving 11 awards and recognitions. In the film, Adler Yang documented the story of his friends' in the Humanity Junior High facing the high-stakes high school entrance exam, the Basic Competence Test (BCT), and followed them until their college years. The film not only examines how high- stakes testing and the tracking systems' shapes students' lives in the long run, but also uncovers a more universal struggle that happens beyond school, when people's pursuit of resources, recognition, or power shakes the foundation of their identities.  Reception and Influence  Originally titled The Soul -- I Don't Want the BCT, the film has been publicly known in Taiwan since 2010, as the project was surprisingly selected as a grantee by the Public Television Service. Since then, Adler Yang and his team at an average age of 15 have been continually invited to educational meetings and conferences to represent the voice of students, joining the public discourse of education reform. First started in 2001, the BCT was announced to be replaced in a few years by President Ma Ying-Jeou on January 1, 2011. In 2013, the last BCT had ended, replaced by the Comprehensive Assessment Program in 2014. In the 2014 South Taiwan Film Festival, Golden Bell Award Best Director John Hsu considered If There is a Reason to Study one of the three most surprising films in the festival, praising that it is the \\"best work among all recent films addressing the education and testing culture in Taiwan.

She previously served as a Member of the United States Sentencing Commission. Early life Patricia Dabney Langhorne was born on June 19, 1967, in Pensacola, Florida. She received her Bachelor of Arts, magna cum laude, from Trinity University, her diploma in legal studies from University College, Oxford, and her Juris Doctor from Yale Law School, where she served as a senior editor of the Yale Journal on Regulation. Career Langhorne started her legal career as a law clerk for Judge Thomas F. Hogan of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. She served as an Associate Counsel to the President during the George W. Bush Administration, as Chief Crime Counsel to Senator Orrin Hatch, as an Assistant United States Attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia, as a trial attorney at the United States Department of Justice, and as an Assistant United States Attorney in the Southern District of California. In 2006, Friedrich was appointed as a member of the United States Sentencing Commission, a position she held until 2016. In that capacity, she helped establish sentencing policies and practices for the federal criminal justice system by promulgating guidelines for congressional review and recommending changes in criminal statutes.  Federal judicial service  On May 8, 2017, President Trump announced his intent to nominate Friedrich to serve as a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, to a seat vacated by Reggie Walton who assumed senior status on December 31, 2015. She was formally nominated on June 7, 2017. On July 25, 2017, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on her nomination. Her nomination was reported out of committee by voice vote on September 14, 2017. On November 16, 2017, the U.S. Senate voted 93‚Äì4 to invoke cloture on Friedrich's nomination. On November 27, the Senate voted 97‚Äì3 to confirm her to the District Court. She received her judicial commission on December 1, 2017. = Notable cases =  Concord Management and Consulting  In June 2018, Friedrich rejected Russian-owned Concord Management and Consulting's request that she examine the instructions provided to the grand jury before the jury indicted the company. Concord accused Special Counsel Robert Mueller's prosecutors of giving faulty instructions, tainting the grand jury's decision to approve charges. On August 13, 2018, in the case of United States v. Concord Management and Consulting LCC, she ruled against the defendant, one of 16 Russian entities charged by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, when it sought to void its indictment on the ground that Mueller's appointment to his position violated constitutional separation of powers. In a 41-page opinion, she held that although \\"no statute explicitly authorizes the Acting Attorney General to make the appointment, Supreme Court and D.C. Circuit precedent make clear that the Acting Attorney General has the necessary statutory authority,\\" \\"the appointment does not violate core separation-of-powers principles. Nor has the Special Counsel exceeded his authority under the appointment order by investigating and prosecuting Concord.\\" In January 2019, Friedrich strongly rebuked the attorneys for Concord Management and Consulting for repeatedly making personal attacks on Mueller's team. The rebuke was triggered by a January 4 filing that questioned the trustworthiness of Mueller's office. Friedrich called Concord's recent filings \\"unprofessional, inappropriate, and ineffective,\\" and said their \\"relentless personal attacks\\" would not affect her decision.

Its source is three miles northeast of the village of Hyde Park, and it enters the Hudson at the Hyde Park campus of the Culinary Institute of America (CIA). The river's name uses an old Dutch version of the given name Marietje, meaning \\"little Mary\\". It is one of two major waterways in Hyde Park, and flows north to south through the town.http://www.co.dutchess.ny.us/CountyGov/Departments/EmergencyResponse/HazardMitigation/Section-9-10-Hyde- Park-T.pdf The river was used by natives since around 1700 BCE, and farms and mills existed around the river from the 18th to mid-20th centuries. The Culinary Institute of America purchased part of the surrounding area in 1970. Course The source of the Maritje Kill is roughly two miles east of the Hudson River, just east of New York State Route 9G. The river runs generally southeast, through land and two trails of the FDR Home's Roosevelt Farm & Forest, until it reaches the Hudson River at a cove at an undeveloped plot of the Hyde Park campus of the Culinary Institute of America, crossing under Amtrak's Empire Corridor railway in the process. Name The river uses an old Dutch version of the name Marietje, meaning \\"little Mary\\". It is a kill, a word taken from the Dutch word for \\"creek\\". The river had kept that name since the area's early history, around the United States' Colonial Era. Other names in use include Marytie's Kill and Maricha Kill. In 1936, Franklin D. Roosevelt wrote in a letter to Helen W. Reynolds that \\"Maritje Kill runs, as you know, right through our place. We have always called it by that name, but I do not know who the little Mary was.\\" Reynolds was a friend and longtime collaborator with FDR, on local history; they were both founding members of the Dutchess County Historical Society. History The Maritje Kill, between Crum Elbow Creek and Fall Kill, 1829 A tributary of the Maritje Kill The Maritje Kill Bridge The Culinary Institute of America owns forested land around the river toward the north end of its developed campus. The site's earliest inhabitance likely started near the Maritje Kill, possibly due to the river's abundance in fish, edible plants, and clean water. A one-year archaeological survey found evidence of human activity in the wooded property dating at least 3,600 years, with elements dating from around 1700 BCE and up until the mid-20th century. Prehistoric objects included stone tools, byproducts of tool production, projectile points, and fire hearths found in the site's portion used for crop cultivation. In The US's Colonial Era, several mills were built on the river. The earliest settlements in the area date to the 1600s, however the earliest recorded land transfer was in 1719. A saw mill was located on the property since at least 1786, owned by a Revolutionary War militia officer and his family. The family burial ground is a short distance across the kill. According to a 1789 map, a grist mill was located on the northern bank of the kill a short distance west of US Route 9. An 1893 county atlas shows large ponds or lakes behind the dam, indicating that the stream level had once been considerably higher. The property changed ownership multiple times in the 1800s. James Roosevelt owned the land as part of his estate in the 1820s, and by the 1860s a farmhouse and stone terraces were constructed along the stream by Moses Beach. In the 1890s the Webendorfer family of Long Island built additional farm buildings. Artifacts and ruins from the Colonial Era dwellings exist, including a site with two house structures, a dam, a mill, retaining walls, and outbuildings and barns. The site was found to be eligible as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places. Excavations unearthed foundation walls, a well, cistern, and post molds, and artifacts from the mid-to-late 1700s, including ceramics, tobacco pipes, coins, buttons, buckles, military objects, thimbles, domesticated animal remains, and an inscribed piece of slate. There are no documents of mills existing on the river east of Route 9, though a large stone dam lies a short way east of the highway, which has a long wooden trough built into it. In February 1976, a collision of two freight trains caused a wreck at the mouth of the river. One of the cars fell into the Maritje Kill's cove, and reportedly the cars spilled hydrochloric acid. A large development, Bellefield at Historic Hyde Park, is planned to be constructed in the forestland across the highway from the CIA. The development will include shops, hotels, spas, 559 units of housing, and a 45-acre farm. It will also include the Parkside Residences at Maritje Place, a group of houses, apartment-style townhouses, and other residential buildings along the Maritje Kill. The developer T-Rex Capital has owned it for several years, after acquiring it from the developer Baker-Gagne, which planned a similar project and abandoned it during the Financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008. Trails The kill crosses through land and two trails of the FDR Home's Roosevelt Farm & Forest. The National Park Service has also desired a connection through to south of the CIA campus, which would require a crossing of the kill. The school plans to eventually make a road crossing the kill, however a concern is over the unstable riverbanks there and a historic site just south of the river. Environmental protection The Maritje Kill Critical Environmental Area surrounds part of the kill in Hyde Park. It includes wetlands and areas designated as containing rare animals and plants.

He is most known for his Sungazing and Afterimage Requiem series.  Themes and inspiration  Ito's work addresses issues of generational connection and deep loss as he explores the materiality of photography as a medium. His current work deals with the tragedy and legacy passed on from his grandfather who survived the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, yet died from cancer and the threat of nuclear disaster which is still present today. His recent works express a strong connection between the sun and his family history regarding the idea of invisibility in light and shadow, and how the unique characteristic of photography as a media has allowed him to express this matter.  Sungazing series  On August 6th, 1945, at 8:15 AM, Kei Ito's grandfather, , witnessed a great tragedy that destroyed nearly everything in Hiroshima. He survived the bombing, yet he lost his family members from the explosion and radiation poisoning. As an activist and author, Ito's grandfather fought against the use of nuclear weaponry throughout his life, until he too passed away from cancer when Kei Ito was ten years old. Ito remembers his grandfather saying that day in Hiroshima was like hundreds of suns lighting up the sky. In order to express the connection between the sun and his family's history, Ito has created 108 letter size prints and a 200-foot long scroll, which were made by exposing Type-C photographic paper to sunlight. The pattern on the scroll corresponds to his breath. In a darkened room, Ito pulled the paper in front of a small aperture to expose it to the direct sunlight while inhaling and paused when exhaling. He repeated this action until he breathed one hundred and eight times. One hundred eight is a number with ritual significance in Japanese Buddhism and culture, called Joya no Kane. It's an event where all of the Buddhist temples in the country strike human size or larger bells one hundred and eight times from New Year's Eve to New Year's Day. The number corresponds to the number of evil desires that we suffer from on earth, which is believed to cause war. This rids us of our evil passions and purifies us for the upcoming year. The ritualistic image making of this repeating act, which corresponds to his breath, has become the act of remembrance.  Exhibitions  Ito has shown in over 50 exhibitions worldwide. Among those are solo exhibitions at prominent spaces such as Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art Museum, Winston-Salem, NC; Masur Museum of Art, Monroe, LA; IA&A; at Hillyer (Hillyer Art Space), DC; and Manifest Gallery, Cincinnati, OH.

Reviews in Mineralogy and Geochemistry. 36 (1): 4.1‚Äì4.195. Originally classified as a eucrite, it was thought to belong to a group of meteorites that originated from the asteroid 4 Vesta, but has since been reclassified based on oxygen and chromium isotopic compositions. It was observed to fall on July 21, 2007, 04:43:56 local time, by the Desert Fireball Network (DFN). Two fragments weighing 150g and 174g were recovered by the DFN at 31¬∞21.0‚Ä≤S, 129¬∞11.4‚Ä≤E in the Nullarbor Desert region, South Australia in November of the same year. This is the first meteorite to be recovered using the Desert Fireball Network observatory.  Petrography & composition  Bunburra rockhole is described as a basaltic monomict breccia, which is composed of three different lithologies that can be distinguished by their grain sizes. There is no evidence of weathering, and very few shock features are present. The majority of the meteorite is subophitic in texture. Primary mineralogy: * Orthopyroxene, Fs62.5Wo3.6, ~ 1mm in size. * Plagioclase, An84.1 to An88.2, ~ 1mm in size. * Augite, Fs27.7Wo43.0, as lamella within pyroxene.  Petrogenesis & origin  Oxygen Isotope analyses have contributed to the classification of meteorites and identification of potential origins. Typically, meteorites of a particular classification will exhibit similar oxygen isotope signatures that are often distinct from meteorites that have originated from other planetary bodies. Equilibrated asteroids, planets and moons are predicted to produce meteorites with distinctive oxygen isotope signatures based on the composition and environment of the planetary body. Bunburra Rockhole exhibits a range of oxygen isotope signatures that vary as a function of the three different lithological subtypes present. This indicates that the parent body of the sample may not have been fully equilibrated at the time of crystallization of the meteorite components in this sample. The oxygen and chromium isotope results from Bunburra Rockhole are quite different to the bulk of the HED meteorite clan. Recently published Cr and O isotope data suggest that Bunburra Rockhole is isotopically similar to Asuka 881394; another outlier of the HED group. Such outliers also exhibit differences in minor element ratios to the HED clan. However, the mineralogy and composition of the Bunburra Rockhole imply it did originate from a differentiated, V-type asteroid, but not from 4-Vesta. = Differentiated asteroid = This type of brecciated achondrite is similar to terrestrial igneous rocks and has undergone igneous processing on a differentiated parent body. Bunburra Rockhole likely came from a differentiated body smaller than 4-Vesta, as this would have resulted in faster cooling and perhaps incomplete differentiation. The differences in oxygen and chromium isotopes and variable trace element compositions relative to the bulk HED measurements are consistent and supportive of this hypothesis. This rock, along with other meteorites close in composition and texture to HEDs, are evidence that there may have been a large number of differentiated bodies once present in our Solar System, and that the igneous processing and activity on those bodies was rather complex.  Orbital data  Bunburra Rockhole was observed to fall using the Desert Fireball Network observatory in Australia. It was found to have an Aten-type orbit. Upon examination of the rock's recent orbital history, it was found to have been ~ 0.04AU from Venus in September 2001. Modelling to understand the evolution of the object's orbit revealed a 98% probability that the object came from the inner region of the main asteroid belt.

Though non-continuous in its presence on campus, a purported founding date of 1840 would make it one of the oldest societies at the college.  Founding  Modeled on the senior societies at Yale, Medusa was founded at Trinity in June 1892 by a group of eighteen Juniors as a student governmental body and honor society \\"responsible for the maintenance of College tradition.\\" The members wore pins bearing the head of Medusa, which lent its name to the society. This organization was believed to be the direct successor to the Grand Tribunal, an institution founded at Washington College in 1840 by seniors and juniors as a rudimentary form of student government which had ceased to exist by 1890.  Membership  Throughout the 20th Century, membership of the Medusa represented \\"the campus sophisticate who had shown enough ingenuity to have himself 'tapped,'\\"‚Äî\\"tapping\\" referring to the public initiations which occurred on the Quad near the end of each spring semester. This public display differed greatly from those of the 19th Century Tribunal, whose clandestine ceremonies \\"were conducted at night with elaborate and mysterious incantations, replete with coffin, human skeleton, sacred seals, and liquid flame, [which] attracted much attention from the Hartford townsfolk.\\" The initiation ceremonies became well-known on campus up until the 1960s, attesting to the prestige of its members. In Trinity College in the Twentieth Century, it is explained that \\"there was occasional criticism of the Medusa's exclusiveness, and there was some dissatisfaction with the Medusa's having designated itself as the senior honorary society.\\" In its present form, little is known about what membership in the Medusa is predicated on. New members are chosen and \\"tapped\\" on random dates throughout the academic year.  Activity  Prior to its dissolution, the tapping ceremony was a yearly tradition that all students looked forward to. Taking place in the spring before the statue of Bishop Brownell, outgoing members of the society tapped seven juniors who had especially distinguished themselves in their first three years at Trinity. \\"Originally [...] the supreme adjudicative system on campus,\\" a gradual shift in authority to the student government ultimately led to the obsolescence of the Medusa's presence on campus after 1968. In the decades that followed, various attempts by students were made sporadically to revive the Medusa, each time with a new mission statement. The last public manifestation saw Medusa as a platform for course evaluations in 1971. In its latest revival, the purpose of the organization is unclear.  Presence on Campus  As an underground society in its current state, the Medusa maintains a high level of secrecy on Trinity's campus and is not recognized by Trinity College. Most information about the society is learned through word of mouth. Medusa members acknowledge each other through a system of archaic hand gestures and expressions that are known only to members.  Location  Medusa holds meetings in semi-permanent locations across Trinity's campus where members socialize and meetings are conducted. Due to the secretive nature of the organization, the locations remain unknown to most students and faculty. However, the current iteration of the society has made it known that it meets Thursdays at 4am in Mather Hall.

She was born in 1862 in Lansing, Michigan. Her family traveled to California and Nevada before finally settling in Osburn, Idaho. In 1870, Young's mother Sarah A. Nichols remarried to Daniel E. Waldron. He was an attorney, and may have inspired Young to enter the legal field. She married Orville R. Young, a miner, in 1887 and started teaching in Shoshone County, Idaho. On October 26, 1895, Young was admitted to the Idaho State Bar on October 26, 1895. At the time of her application, Idaho statutes limited the admission of attorneys in the state to \\"white males\\". Despite this restriction, the Idaho Supreme Court granted her application‚Äîperhaps due to Young's application being sponsored by her stepfather, Weldon Brinton Heyburn (who represented her in a mining case), and W. W. Woods. The latter two individuals were delegates of the Idaho State Constitutional Convention in 1889. When Young was admitted, women had not yet been granted the right to vote in the state.Idaho State Bar, First Fifty Women in Idaho Law, https://isb.idaho.gov/member_services/first50/toc.html Even after being allowed to practice law, Young still continued to work as an educator before she embarked on a political career.

He studied at the Paris Conservatory under F√©tis and Berton and in 1830 was awarded (jointly with Berlioz) the Prix de Rome in composition. He stayed in Rome at the Villa Medici for two years and used the rest of his Prix de Rome bursary to travel and study in other parts of Italy and then in Germany. On his return to Paris in 1835 he made his debut as a composer with a series of instrumental overtures, piano music, and art songs.Michaud, Louis Gabriel (1863). \\"Montfort (Alexandre)\\".

The concept is primarily associated with the United States, where it emerged in 2017. According to Oren Segal of the Anti-Defamation League, the alt-lite \\"operates in the orbit of the alt right\\", and it sometimes may not be possible to tell the difference between the groupings as there is significant cross-over. Others have described it as an offshoot of the alt-right, in that it claims to reject identity politics‚Äîincluding the white nationalism and racialism of the alt-right‚Äîthough they share other key features and beliefs.  History  The term \\"alternative right\\" was coined by Paul Gottfried, but was later adopted by Richard B. Spencer who sought to use it to promote white nationalist ideas across the political right in the United States. However, there remained differing views on the term; some understood it as an umbrella term for a broad range of rightists outside the neoconservatism then dominant in the U.S. conservative movement, including paleoconservatives, libertarians, localists, and right-wing populists as well as white nationalists. By 2010, many of those rightists who used it but were not white nationalists dropped the term after it became increasingly apparent that Spencer intended the term as a banner of white nationalism. In 2016, as the term became popularised in U.S. public discourse, it again came to be used by many people who were not white nationalists but who saw it as a useful term to refer to rightists outside the mainstream conservative movement. Some have traced the recognition of the alt- lite‚Äîas a distinct entity from the alt-right‚Äîto what is seen as the consolidation of the alt-right as a white nationalist movement. In a speech given to a meeting of white nationalists in November 2016, Richard B. Spencer (who is often credited with creating or popularizing the term \\"alt-right\\") quoted Nazi propaganda and declared \\"Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory!\\" while members of the audience responded to this by giving Hitler salutes. Subsequently, various figures who had been linked to the alt-right distanced themselves from Spencer's remarks, and suggested that two factions had emerged from the alt-right. This was the result of a \\"rift\\" within the wider alt-right movement, between those on the one hand favoring white nationalism and explicit racism, and more moderate forces on the other. Some members of the latter group at first adopted the term \\"new right\\" to describe themselves, with Mike Cernovich saying of the division that \\"[t]he lines are drawn and the fracture is more or less complete\\". The term \\"alt-lite\\" is thought by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) to have been created by members of the alt-right to distinguish themselves from right-wing groups and ideologies who support white supremacy and white nationalism. According to the ADL, there is crossover and line-toeing between the Alt-right and Alt-lite groupings, making it difficult or impossible to tell which side of the theoretical line they belong on. =Etymology of \\"alt-lite\\"= The division between alt-right and alt-lite received further media attention in June 2017 when the two factions found themselves divided over the issue of Spencer's attendance at a Free Speech rally in Washington, D.C. Certain individuals protested Spencer's involvement by organizing a competing rally on the same day, with Spencer referring to such individuals as \\"alt-lite\\" and saying that \\"the movement needs a good purge\\". The Unite the Right rally in 2017 exacerbated tensions between the white nationalist alt-right and the alt-lite. Breitbart distanced itself from the alt-right and criticized other media outlets that described them in such a manner, as did Milo Yiannopoulos, who insisted he had \\"nothing in common\\" with Spencer. The commentator Angela Nagle described the alt-lite as \\"the youthful bridge between the alt-right and mainstream Trumpism\\". She was of the view that it was the alt-lite, and not the alt-right, which had successfully utilised the Nouvelle Droite's ideas about promoting cultural change as a prerequisite for long-term cultural change. Nagle characterized Cernovich as a \\"major figure in the alt-lite milieu\\". She also characterized Alex Jones as being part of it.  Beliefs  People associated with the alt- lite have distanced themselves from the ethnic nationalism of the alt-right. As with the alt-right, the alt-lite commonly shows broad support for Donald Trump and non-interventionism, criticism of and/or opposition to political correctness, Islam, feminism, welfare and illegal immigration. The movement is also seen as engaging in conspiracy theories, including the propagation of the Pizzagate conspiracy theory, as well as support for the Gamergate movement. It has been described as a \\"misogynistic\\" and \\"xenophobic\\" movement by the Anti- Defamation League. Alt-right figures have described Breitbart News and Steve Bannon as \\"alt-lite\\" for presenting a diluted form of alt-right ideas. Wired has referred to the alt-lite as \\"the alt-right's relatively mild-mannered sibling\\". The Anti-Defamation League has published a list of people whom it calls alt-lite, consisting of writer and podcast host Brittany Pettibone, Maryland activist Colton Merwin, 2018 Senate Republican candidate from Virginia Corey Stewart, Proud Boys founder Gavin McInnes, English YouTuber Paul Joseph Watson, conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec, New Zealand activist Kyle Chapman, Kyle Prescott, conservative White House correspondent Lucian Wintrich, Mike Cernovich, and Milo Yiannopoulos.

He is also a senior scientist of the Indian National Science Academy at Bose Institute and a former Raja Ramanna fellow of Department of Atomic Energy at Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics. Known for the development of a sum rule on two-photon processes, Roy is an elected fellow of all the three major Indian science academies ‚Äì Indian Academy of Sciences, Indian National Science Academy and National Academy of Sciences, India ‚Äì as well as of the American Physical Society. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the apex agency of the Government of India for scientific research, awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, one of the highest Indian science awards, for his contributions to physical sciences in 1987.  Biography  Bose Institute, Kolkata King's College, Cambridge Born on 4 October 1942 at Calcutta in the Bengal state of British India to Kiran Lal Roy-Sujata Sikdar couple, Probir Roy graduated in physics with honours from Presidency College under Calcutta University in 1962 before moving to Cambridge University to obtain an MA (cantab) from Kings College, Cambridge in 1965. Subsequently, he joined Stanford University for his doctoral studies and secured a PhD, mentored by S. M. Berman, for his thesis in Kaon physics, in 1968. During this period, he worked at Stanford Linear Accelerator Center as a research assistant (1966‚Äì68) and as a temporary research associate (1968). He remained in the US for three more years for his post-doctoral work at Cornell University where he worked at the laboratories of Kenneth G. Wilson, who would go on to receive the Nobel Prize for physics in 1982, and Toichiro Kinoshita, an APS fellow, simultaneously serving the University as an instructor. Before returning to India in 1972, he had a one-year spell at CERN during 1971‚Äì72 as a visiting scientist. Roy's career at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research started in 1972 as a visiting fellow and he became a regular research fellow a year later. He served the institution for three decades and half and before his superannuation from TIFR service as a senior professor in 2017, he held various positions as reader (1976‚Äì83), associate professor (1983‚Äì90) and professor (1990‚Äì93). After retiring from regular service, he continued his research at Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics as a DAE Raja Ramanna fellow of the Board of Research in Nuclear Sciences (BRNS) until 2012 and carries on his research at the Center for Astroparticle Physics and Space Science (CAPSS) of Bose Institute as a senor scientist of the Indian National Science Academy ever since. In between, he had several spells abroad as a visiting faculty and the institutions he has served include Oxford University, University of Texas at Austin, University of California, Riverside, University of Hawaii at Manoa, University of Helsinki and Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics. Roy is married to Manashi Bhattacharya and the couple has two children, Jagori and Analabha. The family lives in Salt Lake, a satellite city of Kolkata, West Bengal.  Legacy  Photon-photon scattering (a Feynman diagram) Roy's work in Kaon physics during his doctoral studies at Stanford University was based on the applications of algebra in the discipline and his thesis was subsequently published by the university under the title, Current-algebra Applications in Kaon Physics. Later, he worked on scale invariance and deep inelastic scattering while at CERN, Geneva and his research thereafter has covered several aspects of high energy physics. He has developed a new sum rule in two-photon processes which is related to the collision of two real polarised photons and the equation is now known as Roy's Sum Rule. Further, he proposed a solution for U(n)-symmetric Thirring model which has been detailed in two of his articles published in 1975. Later, shifting his focus to supersymmetry and supergravity, he suggested new œÑ -number violating signals for R-parity breaking and estimated an upper bound on the gaugino-gravitino mass ratio. Deep inelastic lepton-hadron-photon processes with regard to their phenomenological aspects have been another area of his studies. He has also done extensive studies on neutrinos and Higgs mesons which covered the detection of heavy neutrinos, ultralight neutrinos in super-symmetry, oscillations and flavours, and his studies on neutrino detection helped India- based Neutrino Observatory in blueprinting the proposed detector at the observatory. Roy's studies have been documented by way of a number of articles and the online article repository of the Indian Academy of Sciences has listed 106 of them. Besides, he has published four more books other than his PhD thesis viz. Theory of Lepton-Hadron Processes at High Energies: Partons, Scale Invariance and Light-Cone Physics, Supersymmetry and Supergravity Nonperturbative QCD Phenomenology of the standard model and beyond, and Theory and Phenomenology of Sparticles: An Account of Four-Dimensional N=1 Supersymmetry in High Energy Physics. He has also contributed chapters to books published by others and has mentored doctoral and post-doctoral scholars. The lecture series or invited talks delivered by him included Linear collider signals of anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking, at the physics working group meeting of American Linear Collider Physics in 2004, The wonderful world of neutrinos at S.N. Bose National Centre for Basic Sciences in 2004, Measuring the deviation from maximal mixing of atmospheric neutrinos at INO, at PANIC 05 in Santa Fe, New Mexico, Event-shape of dileptons plus missing energy at a linear collider as a SUSY/ADD discriminant at Indian Institute of Science in 2006, Symmetries of nonhierarchical neutrinos from high to low scales at IWTHEP-2007, and Dark Energy of the Universe at Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune in 2015. Roy is one among the Indian participants in the Oxford-India Network in Theoretical Physical Sciences, an initiative promoted by the John Fell Fund. He was a member of the research committee of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research during 1991‚Äì94. He served as the chairman of the Physics Graduate School from 1992 to 1997 and the Department of Theoretical Physics from 1997 to 2002, both based at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research. He sat in the governing council of S.N. Bose National Centre for Basic Sciences from 1997 to 2002 and in the editorial boards of Indian Journal of Pure and Applied Physics, Pramana and Indian Journal of Physics during various terms. He also served as the vice- president of the Indian Physical Society in 1996 and presided the society in 2002.  Awards and honours  During his college days at King's College, Cambridge, Roy received three honours from the institution; Powel Prize for the best student in natural sciences (1964), senior scholarship (1964) and honorary scholarship (1965). The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize, one of the highest Indian science awards in 1987. The Indian Academy of Sciences elected him as a fellow in 1989 and he became a fellow of the Indian National Science Academy in 1992. Two years later, INSA selected him for the exchange fellowship between the academy of the Royal Society and the American Physical Society elected him as a fellow in 1995. He delivered the Meghnad Saha award oration of the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science in 1997 and received the elected fellowship of the National Academy of Sciences, India in 2001.

It also owned radio stations in regional South Australia and Queensland, a range of Australian classified advertising websites, and Australian commercial printing plants. On 6 December 2006 it was announced that Rural Press Limited and John Fairfax Holdings would merge to form a new company estimated in value at $12 billion.Knight, Elizabeth: Stakes raised in media's cold war, The Sydney Morning Herald, 7 December 2006. Under the deal, the family company of Rural Press chairman John B. Fairfax (who did not have an interest in the company bearing his family's name) would take a 13.5 per cent stake in the merged entity. This was just short of a controlling interest, but gave Fairfax a potential blocking stake if Publishing and Broadcasting Limited, News Corporation, the Seven Network or a private equity raider embarked on a hostile takeover, as had been widely anticipated following the Federal Parliament's passage of new media laws on October 18, 2006.Long, Stephen: Fairfax, Rural press announce plan for merger, ABC Radio National, 6 December 2006. The merger with Fairfax was completed on 8 May 2007.Rural Press, Fairfax officially merged, The Age, 9 May 2007.

Geographical situation and topography Loch Monar and surrounding Munros Lurg Mh√≤r, is situated west of Loch Monar and east of the strath of Bearneas and the Attadale Forest, is one of a horseshoe of Munros around the loch. Glen Carron lies to the north and Glen Shiel to the south. The west ridge of Lurg Mh√≤r curves round to the north before rising to Bidein a' Choire Sheasgaich, a separate Munro. Lurg Mh√≤r has a long, relatively flat east ridge where Meall Mhor (a Munro Top) is situated. The ridge is narrow in places and some scrambling (which cannot be avoided easily) is required between Lurg Mh√≤r and Meall Mhor. This ridge has steep cliffs facing north but on the southern side the slope is gentle and grassy. The ridge leads down to Loch Monar at Pait Lodge. The mountain is located on the Attadale Estate. The bedrock is of the Glenfinnan Group of the Moine Supergroup ‚Äì highly metamorphosed sedimentary sandstone. and Approaches to the mountain Approaching Lurg Mh√≤r from Bidein a' Choire Sheasgaich East ridge, north face Lurg Mh√≤r and Bidein a' Choire Sheasgaich are, according to Cameron McNeish, \\"two of the lonliest Munros in the land\\" An approach can be made from the north, the east or the west. All the approach routes are long and arduous but, if a two-day expedition is planned, three open bothies are available as an alternative to wild camping. The route from the east is along, and possibly around, Loch Monar which is reached through Glen Strathfarrar. From Struy a private road goes along the glen to the foot of the loch at Monar Lodge. Cycling is allowed and a very limited number of vehicles are also permitted access. Even if using a mountain bike the expedition is, according to Dan Bailey \\"a single epic trip, which can be undertaken either as an appealingly brutal one-day assault or a slower overnighter\\". The route round the loch traversing these Munros and the three immediately north of the loch is plus cycling ‚Äì 18 hours. The shortest route to the mountain from a public road is from Achnashellach (Lair) in Glen Carron to the north on the A890 but to start off it is necessary to wade across the River Carron or use the two-wire bridge ‚Äì cycling is not an option. Otherwise, from Craig nearby there is a somewhat longer route which may be cycled for the first ‚Äì this way the total distance to Lurg Mh√≤r is ‚Äì 5 hours 30 minutes on foot. Bearnais bothy is a Mountain Bothies Association bothy not far off these routes and for a stop-over it is conveniently located. However, a less hilly route to get there directly is from Achintee (Strathcarron station) from where it may be reached by a stalkers' path of . From the west at Attadale there is an track along which a mountain bike may be ridden, with difficulty, to the open bothy at Ben Dronaig Lodge which is maintained by the Attadale Estate to a very high standard. From bothy to Lurg Mh√≤r is another on a stalkers' path. A shorter stalkers' path leads to this bothy from Achintee (Strathcarron station). Maol Bhuidhe bothy is an MBA bothy which can be reached from Atterdale or Killian (Camus-luinie carpark) on mountain bike by tracks at least long. Rock climbs On the north of Lurg Mh√≤r's west ridge a crag of quartzite provides several routes, two of which are graded very severe.

It has a rosette of fleshy leaves at its base and a single white, green and reddish-brown flower. Description Pterostylis cucullata, is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber. It has between four and seven egg-shaped to oblong leaves, some of which form a rosette at the base and some partly wrap around the flowering stem. The leaves are long and wide, dark green, fleshy and flat. A single white, green and reddish-brown flower is borne on a flowering stem high. The flowers are long, wide. The dorsal sepal and petals are joined and curve forward in a semi-circle, forming a hood called the \\"galea\\" over the column. There is a wide gap at each side of the flower between the petals and the lateral sepals. The lateral sepals have a tapering tip, long, only slightly longer than the galea and there is a narrow but deep notch in the sinus between them. The labellum is long, about wide, slightly curved, dark brown and blunt and only protrudes slightly above the sinus. Flowering occurs from August to October. Taxonomy and naming Pterostylis cucullata was first formally described in 1810 by Robert Brown and the description was published in Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen. The specific epithet (cucullata) is derived from the Latin word cucullus meaning \\"cap\\", or \\"hood\\". There are two subspecies, differing mainly in the height of the flowering stem: * Pterostylis cucullata subsp. cucullata grows to a height of ; * Pterostylis cucullata subsp. sylvicola grows to a height of up to . Distribution and habitat The leafy greenhood is widely distributed in Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania but only in small, isolated populations. Both subspecies are present in Victoria as small groups in coastal areas and inland watercourses. It grows in shady forest slopes in South Australia but is very rare there. It is extinct on the main island of Tasmania and King Island, presently found only on Hunter Island and Three Hummock Island in Bass Strait. Conservation Pterostylis cucullata is listed as \\"vulnerable\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The main threats to the species are habitat loss and disturbance, weed invasion and grazing by rabbits, hares and snails.

Their capital was at Bhutamabilika (now Ghumli). The known historical events during their rule are the attacks of Arabs repulsed by Agguka I. Sources of information The earliest reference of Saindhava was found in Navsari copperplate of Chalukya governor of Lata region (modern-day South Gujarat) Avanijanashraya Pulakeshin dated 738-39 CE which enlisted the dynasties defeated by Arabs and finally repelled by him. The eighth verse in Gwalior prashasti of Bhojadeva describes the Saindhava ruler defeated by Pratihara king Nagabhatta. The nine copper plate grants issued by Saindhavas help to establish their genealogy as well as provides useful information about the dynasty. Six grants inscribed in 12 copper plates were discovered while digging on roadside in Ghumli in 1936. One more copper plate issued by Jaika was recovered from Morbi. A clay seal referring to Pushyena was recovered from Valabhi (Vala). Another copperplate grant is found from Ambalas (near Junagadh). One more from Dhinki issued by Jaikadeva (purportedly from 738 CE) was found as a forgery later. Origin and rule Saindhavas were probably originated from Sindh (now in Pakistan) who moved southward and established themselves in Apara-Surashtra (western Saurashtra comprising modern Jamnagar, Devbhoomi Dwarka, Rajkot, Morbi and Porbandar districts in Gujarat, India). The Ghumli grant issued by Jaika II describes their family as Jayadratha- vamsa. It is probably because he wanted to associate his family with Jayadratha of Sindhu Kingdom in epic Mahabharata. It was a common practice to associate royal family with Puranic heroes in 9th-10th century. Other plates describes themselves as Saindhavas as they originated from Sindh. Their capital was at Bhutambilika or Bhumlika (now Ghumli) in Barda hills. Their emblem was fish, the sign of Varuna and suitable for their naval supremacy. The early kings ruled probably in an allegiance with the Maitrakas of Vallabhi. They ruled Halar and Sorath regions constituting western part of Saurashta peninsula. History Pushyadeva is the earliest known king mentioned in the grants found from Ghumli. A clay seal referring to Pushyena, son of Ahivarma was recovered from Vallabhi (Vala). It was believed that this Pushyena and Pushyadeva were one person but a copperplate found from Ambalas mentions Ahivarma as a son of Pushyena. So Pushyadeva might be a son of another Ahivarma. It seems that Ahivarma I was probably ruling in Sindh and his son Pushyena had to move Saurashtra due to invasion by Arabs Arabs fighting for the Umayyad Caliphate (711 CE). His clay seal was found in Valabhi (Vala) which implies that he was probably a Mahasenapati (Chief Commander) under Maitrakas. He might have gained power later. Pushyena was succeeded by his son Ahivarma II whose title was Maharaja. He had given a grant to Bhikkhuni-Vihara from Kuberanagara (probably near Kodinar or Kubada village near Amreli). The date of grant is not clear but may belong to Valabhi Era 404 (723 CE). Pushyadeva, son of Ahivarma II, is mentioned in the last grant found from Ghumli and he probably ruled from c. 735 to 750, based on dates of his descendants. His capital was at Ghumli and was a contemporary of Maitraka ruler Shiladitya VI. He is mentioned as Jayadratha-vamsha-shekhara. He was succeeded by his son Krishnaraja I who reigned c. 750 CE to 770 CE. He had five titles including Mahasamanta. Agguka I, son of Krishnaraja I, succeeded him and reigned c. 770 CE to 790 CE. He is praised heavily in two early grants found from Ghumli. During his rule, the Arabs tried to establish themselves in the Saurashtra. In 759 CE, Hasham was appointed as the governor of Sindh who sent an Arab naval fleet under Amarubin Jamal to attack to the coast of Barda region. It was defeated by the Saindhava naval fleet, which was then leading naval power of western India. Twenty years later, another Arab naval fleet was sent, which initially succeeded in capturing a town near Barda. The campaign was withdrawn following an outbreak of an epidemic, according to Arab historians. They also state that the Caliph decided to never enter India from there again. But Agguka I's inscriptions state that he had severely defeated the Arabs in 776 CE and they had to withdraw. He took the title Apara Samudradhipati, \\"Master of the Sea\\". During his reign, Valabhi probably fell due to Arab invasion (788 CE). Agguka's son and successor Ranaka I probably reigned from c. 790 CE to 810 CE. He is mentioned in Ghumli grant which states that he had donated a village in Pachchhatri Vishaya (district). It also mentions his wife Kshemeshwari. He had two sons, Krishnaraja II and Jaika I. Ranaka I was succeeded by his son Krishnaraja II (reigned c. 810 CE to 825 CE). He was succeeded by his infant son Agguka II. The Ghumli grant dated Gupta Era 513 (832 CE) is issued by his uncle Jaika I, step-brother of Krishnaraja II, so it seems that Agguka II ruled probably for very short period and he was disposed by his uncle few years before 832 CE, probably c. 830 CE. This grant mentions the donation of a Dhak (now Dhank) village in Pachchatri Vishaya to a Brahmin from Someshwara (now Somnath). Another undated grant mentions the donation of a village to a Brahmin of Bhillamala (now Bhinmal) in the same district. He reigned c. 825 CE to 845 CE. His sons were Agguka III and Chamudaraja. Jaika I was succeeded by Agguka III who reigned c. 845 CE to 870 CE. None of grants is found but he is praised in grant by his son and successor Ranaka II. He reigned c. 870 CE to 880 CE. His grant dated Gupta Era 555 (874-875 CE) mentions the donation of villages in Swarnamanjari district to some temples and a monastery. It also mentions his son Jaika but he did not succeeded him probably because he died early or his granduncle Chamundaraja usurped the throne. He probably reigned from c. 880 CE to 885 CE. Chamundaraja was succeeded by his son Agguka IV who reigned c. 885 CE to 900 CE. He had donated a village to a Brahmin in Swarnamanjari district in Gupta Era 567 (886-887 CE). He was succeeded by Jaika II (reigned c. 900 CE to 920 CE) who was the last known ruler. His two grants are recovered from Ghumli and Morbi. Morbi grant mentions the donation of a village to two Brahmins. Ghulmi grant has a long genealogy from Pushyadeva to Jaika II but does not mention branches of Krishnaraja II and Agguka III. Jaika II had granted a village to Nanna Mathika, a monastery, in Swarnamanjari district in Gupta Era 596 (915 CE). It was built by Nanna, a trader from Bhillamala and was located near Purushottam monastery in Bhutambilika division. The copper plate inscription of Ranaka Bashkaladeva dated 987 CE found from Ghulmi indicates that he was probably a vassal of Chaulukyas of Patan and ruled \\"Jyeshthukadesha\\", a region around Ghumli. But the inscription does not refer to Saindhavas or their descendants. It is assumed that between 920 CE and 987 CE, the rule of the Saindhavas ended. Ghumli was the capital under the Jethwa dynasty who later ruled the region. There might be some relation between Jayadratha-Saindhava dynasty and the Jethwa dynasty which had Hanuman as its emblem instead of fish. Architecture Their notable constructions are Hindu monastery (mathika) at Ghumli and temples dedicated to Surya, Shiva and Shakti (Goddess) at Suvarnamanjari. The inscriptions referring to temples are scarce. The temples constructed in this period follows the contemporary and earlier traditions of Maitrakas.

Jointly produced by Pushkara Mallikarjunaiah and H.K.Prakash, the film features Rakshit Shetty and Shanvi Srivastava in lead roles. B. Ajaneesh Loknath and Charan Raj composed the soundtrack, with the former composing the score. Karm Chawla handled the cinematography. Described by Shetty as \\"Southern Odd Fiction\\", the film follows a corrupt police officer who takes on a bandit chief in order to recover a missing treasure in the 1980s. The film was released in Kannada on December 27, 2019. Synopsis The story starts with Ramarama, the leader of the Abhiras, killing a group of musicians and actors for allegedly looting missing treasure in Amaravati, Karnataka. On his deathbed, Ramarama names Tukaram, his second son his successor, prompting Jayaram, his eldest son to quickly usurp the throne from his brother. He claims that he will not take the throne until the treasure is returned, prompting a territory wide search. 15 years later, and the treasure is still missing. Lakshmi (Shanvi Srivastava) is a local journalist covering Harishchandra, a treasure hunter. She witnesses Harishchandra's kidnapping, and goes to report it to Narayana (Rakshit Shetty), the local police officer. Narayana haughtily assumes he had caught Harishchandra's kidnappers but they were Harishchandra's bodyguards, sent by Tukaram. Tukaram confronts Narayana for having arrested his men and allowing the treasurehunter to be kidnapped, possibly by Jayaram. Tukaram issues ultimatum to Narayana to bring back the treasurehunter at his own risk. Later, by chance Narayana finds out the missing Harishchandra in the reporters van. Narayana makes up a story that he rescued the treasurehunter from Jayaram's highly guarded fort, but it is revealed to the viewers that not Tukaram or Jayaram, but it was Narayana who had gotten the treasurehunter kidnapped and that Narayana is also behind the treasure. Jayaram catches hold of Narayana after being outraged seeing newspaper coverage of Narayana's alleged breaking into Jayaram's fort. He manages to wittily escape from Jayaram's fort. Later he finds out that the tribe of the killed drama artists are still waiting for their last play in Amaravati and wouldn't leave until their 'Hari' comes and redeems them. The prophecy uttered by a revered saint of theirs says that an eagle would sit on the 'Hari' and he would be their rescuer who would help them. One night Narayana and his aide Achyutanna witnesses a few people of this drama troupe artists carrying away treasurehunter Harishchandra in the dead of the night. They were under the belief that Harishchandra would be their 'Hari'. Following these people from the drama troupe Narayana reaches their hideout, exchanges the costumes with the artists and to everyone's surprise, the eagle sits on his arm. It is then revealed that there is a group of people in the tribe of drama artists who are logical thinkers and are against this prophecy which also includes Lakshmi and the reporters. They had planned to have the eagle sit on one among them using a small trickery, but since Narayana took away the costume of that person, the eagle sat on Narayana instead. When in station with the drama artists they reveal to Narayana that a map was made for the lost treasure but they had no idea about where the map would be. Narayana feels that the band master from the killed drama troupe who is still in Jayaram's custody and who has lost his memory may know about this. Lakshmi, along with the group who don't believe the prophecy, kidnap Narayana but he escapes from there and reaches Jayaram's fort and creates misunderstanding among the Abhiras due to which the scenes of killing the drama artists is recreated before the band master but, unfortunately nothing brings his memory back. While the other people whom Jayaram suspected are put in the dungeons, Narayana is also put with them for not revealing the truth of the group of drama artists he found. However he escapes by keeping a gun on Jayaram and allows Tukaram to enter the fort and also allows a group of prisoners to escape. Once again with his wit, he escapes from the brothers who now are standing by pointing a gun at each other along with their men. On the way he also finds out that the band master is also escaping and catches him and decodes his words to find out that the map to the treasure lies in the troupe's last play. The prophecy also says that their Hari would also come along with his Lakshmi. Thus Narayana convinces Lakshmi to aid him and admits to the drama tribe that he is their prophesied Hari, and also makes the people happy by telling that they can stage their last play and leave the town in peace. The last play belongs to a scene from Samudra manthan but Narayana is unable to deduce the hidden clue from the scene. So he tries to extend the drama but Lakshmi, who still is suspicious about Narayana's motives, announces that there won't be rehearsals but directly the show. Narayana decodes the map and reaches the place of treasure along with Tukaram's people. Meanwhile Tukaram's men kidnap all the people of the troupe and burn the fort along with the troupe and there after finding the treasure Tukarama's people turn against Narayana but it happens to be that the box was full of stones and this angers Tukaram's men and they lock Narayana in the chest and bury him. From inside the chest Narayana decodes the actual mystery but his conscience makes him guilty thus he decides to help the drama troupe. Meanwhile in the fort, Jayarama had broken out of Tukaram's custody and had led a riot and imprisoned Tukaram instead. As Narayana was desperately struggling to stay alive in the buried chest, he is rescued from the chest. The four prisoners whom Narayana helped from Jayaram's prison help him outside after he escapes the chest and he reaches Jayaram's fort along with the treasure. Jayarama fights with Narayana even as the fort is burning down. When Jayarama asks if anyone in the crowd dares to be a candidate for the Abhira clan leadership other than him, Narayana places himself on the throne saying he is eligible for the throne as he brought the treasure to the fort as specified, and tells the Abhira clan members that his first and final order is that from now on no one need not follow the Abhira way of living this leading to all the Abhiras leaving Jayarama behind and running out of the burning fort. After the final fight the fort is fully destroyed and Narayana too escapes, and he saves Tukaram on his way out. Jayaram sits in the seat of his late father as the fort burns down. Lakshmi and the drama artists waiting outside is overjoyed to see Narayana, and Lakshmi finally sees goodness in Narayana and hugs him, thus actually fulfilling the prophecy of Hari accompanied by Lakshmi having saved the drama tribe.In the mid credit scene, it is shown that the last play of the drama troupe is finally being enacted and Narayana and Lakshmi are planning to get married. In the post credits scene, it‚Äôs shown that Treasure Hunter Harishchandra finally manages to make his way into the treasure chest now in the fort‚Äôs ruins using his pendulums. There, he sees a man sitting on the treasure box. When he asks who he is, the man says he is Narayana‚Äôs father.

In 2017 the Sunday Times estimated her wealth at ¬£650m making her the 196th wealthiest person in the UK. She is the founder and President of the Gudavadze-Patarkatsishvili Foundation, that supports education initiatives in Georgia.Founders Letter, GPF Foundation, December 2018 She has two daughters, Liana Zhmotova and Iya Patarkatsishvili. The death of her husband sparked one of the biggest estate battles ever that forced Inna and her family to fight for their interests in the courts against several of Badri's former business associates. Inna now has extensive business and property interests in Georgia and across the rest of the world. Born in Tbilisi, Georgia, Inna graduated with honours from the Georgian State Institute of Foreign Languages. She married Badri Patarkatsishvili in 1979 with whom she raised two daughters, Liana (1980) and Iya (1983). For 19 years she worked as a translator at the Tbilisi Scientific Research Institute of Electron-Ion Technology. The family moved to Moscow in 1993 and returned to Georgia in 2000. Inna helped her husband during his life with numerous charitable and civic projects both in Russia and in Georgia. Many of these related to landscape design which continues to be a hobby. Business interests Imedi ‚Äì The first and largest independent television station in Georgia, launched by Badri Patarkatsishvili in 2003.

Estate battle Inna's husband, Badri Patarkatsishvili, died intestate in February 2008. Inna and her family, the rightful heirs to his residual estate, were forced to defend their interests from some of her late husband's closest business associates. Having been left with close to nothing, they successfully pursued their interests through the courts in the UK, US, Georgia, Gibraltar and Liechtenstein.[Ibid] =Joseph Kay & the forged testimony documents= Immediately after Badri died, Joseph Kay, a distant relative of Badri who had assisted with his business affairs, along with Emmanuel Zeltser, an American lawyer, unlawfully attempted to take control of numerous assets that had belonged to Badri including the Georgian TV station, Imedi, Mtatsminda Park, the Rustavi Metallurgical Plant in Georgia and a large development on Fisher Island in Florida. Kay and Zeltser claimed to be in possession of Badri's last will and testament that appointed Kay as executor of the estate. These documents were later declared to be forgeries in the UK High Court.Gudavadze v Kay [2012]EWHC 1683 (Ch) An attempt by trustees of the family estate to establish Kay's legal position led to a comprehensive dismissal of Kay's case by Mr Justice Dudley in the Supreme Court of Gibraltar in February 2010. Mr Justice Dudley described Kay's case as \\"wholly unconvincing\\", adding that we was a \\"mendacious individual\\" and \\"certainly not a witness of truth.\\"In the matter of the trusts known as The Valmore Trust and The Summit Trust, Mar Justice Dudley, The Supreme Court of Gibraltar, Claim No. 2008 M No70, 17 December 2009 After further battles in the US, UK and Georgia, the assets were eventually returned to Inna and her family. =Arbitration in Georgia= Following Badri's death, the Georgian TV station, Imedi, that had been set up by Badri to combat government media censorship and had been fiercely critical of the President Mikhail Saakashvili, fell in the hands of Joseph Kay, and, according to Inna, became a mouthpiece for the government. The watchdog, Reporters Without Borders, described the move as \\"\\"a real setback for freedom of expression.\\" Enlisting the support of the former UK Attorney General, Lord Goldsmith, in December 2008 Inna began international arbitration proceedings against the Government of Georgia, claiming that the TV station, as well as other Georgian assets that had belonged to Badri, had been unfairly expropriated from them with the assistance of the government. On the 29 October 2008, Inna Gudavadze told a press conference in Tbilisi that Imedi and Mtatsminda Park were ‚ÄúBadri‚Äôs personal projects for Georgia and the Georgian people and as his wife I have a duty to see that these works are carried on.\\" In July 2011, the Patarkatsishvili family reached a settlement with the government that saw Mtatsminda Park returned to Inna and the family in return for them renouncing all claims to the ownership of Imedi TV. Following the fall of President Mikhail Saakashvili, Imedi was also subsequently returned to Inna and her family in October 2012 under the new government. In July 2014, the Chief Prosecutor‚Äôs Office of Georgia issued a criminal indictment to former President Mikhail Saakashvili and a group of state officials for their role in the illegal expropriation of the Georgian assets owned by the Patarkasishvili family. =Settlement with Boris Berezovsky= In the autumn of 2012 Inna reached a confidential settlement with Badri's former business partner, Boris Berezovsky. Berezovsky and Badri had jointly owned a number of assets but in 2006 announced an \\"economic divorce\\" which had not completed by the time Badri died. Following Badri's death Berezovsky had launched a claim against Inna for ownership of half of Badri's estate. The case was later settled out of court. =Metaloinvest= In 2013 Inna Gudavadze, her two daughters Iya Patarkatsishvili and Liana Zhmotova, and Badri's mother Natela Patarkatsishvili brought a $1.8bn action against another of Badri's business associates, Vasily Anisimov. The family claimed that they had a part-entitlement to the 20% share formerly held by Mr Anisimov in mining company Metalloinvest. The case was settled in March 2014 before it came to court. On conclusion of the case, a family spokesman told the Financial Times ‚ÄúI am very pleased to confirm that a settlement has been reached between my clients and Mr Anisimov which conclusively brings to an end the long-running dispute.\\" References Category:Businesspeople from Georgia (country) Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Inna Gudavadze"},{"id":"53999551","text":"L.

AIADMK leader Jayalalithaa allocated the Usilampatti constituency candidacy to Santhanam in the 2001 elections as part of an electoral pact with the AIFB. His 2006 candidacy for the AIADMK was a consequence of a dispute within the AIFB, a party with which he had been at odds since at least 2004 despite being its general secretary. He was the sole AIFB MLA in the 2001-2006 Assembly and he disagreed with the AIFB leadership's interest in abandoning their electoral pact with the AIADMK for the 2006 elections. Despite his attempts in the courts to prevent it, Santhanam was expelled from the AIFB by its new president, the actor-politician Karthik, and reached an individual agreement with the AIADMK to contest a seat in the election.

Because the RI can serve as an intrinsic imaging contrast for transparent or phase objects, measurements of RI tomograms can provide label-free quantitative imaging of microscopic phase objects. In order to measure 3-D RI tomogram of samples, HT employs the principle of holographic imaging and inverse scattering. Typically, multiple 2D holographic images of a sample are measured at various illumination angles, employing the principle of interferometric imaging. Then, a 3D RI tomogram of the sample is reconstructed from these multiple 2D holographic images by inversely solving light scattering in the sample.  History  The first theoretical proposal was presented by Emil Wolf, and the first experimental demonstration was shown by Fercher et al. From 2000s, HT techniques had been extensively studied and applied to the field of biology and medicine, by several research groups including the MIT spectroscopy laboratory. Both the technical developments and applications of HT have been significantly advanced. In 2012 the first commercial HT company Nanolive was founded, later followed by Tomocube in 2014.  Principles  The principle of HT is very similar to X-ray computed tomography (CT) or CT scan. CT scan measures multiple 2-D X-ray images of a human body at various illumination angles, and a 3-D tomogram (X-ray absorptivity) is then retrieved via the inverse scattering theory. Both the X-ray CT and laser HT shares the same governing equation ‚Äì Helmholtz equation, the wave equation for a monochromatic wavelength. HT is also known as optical diffraction tomography.  Advantages and limitations  HT provides following advantages over conventional 3D microscopic techniques. # Label-free: Cellular membrane and subcellular organelles can clearly be imaged without using exogenous labeling agents. Thus, there are no issues of phototoxicity, photobleaching, and photodamaging. # Quantitative imaging capability: HT directly measures cell‚Äôs 3D RI maps, which is intrinsic optical properties of materials. Because the measured RI can be translated into the mass density of a cell and using this information, mass of a cell can also be retrieved. # Precise and fast measurements: HT provides the spatial resolution down to approximately 100 nm and the temporal resolution of a few to a hundred frames per second, depending on the numerical apertures of used objective lenses and the speed of an image sensor. However, 3D RI tomography does not provide molecular specificity. Generally, the measured RI information cannot be directly related to information about molecules or proteins, except for notable cases such as gold nanoparties or lipid droplets that exhibit distinctly high RI values compared to cell cytoplasm.  Applications  The applications of HT includes 3D RI tomogram of a live cell (macrophage) = Cell biology = HT provides 3D dynamic images of live cells and thin tissues without using exogenous labeling agents such as fluorescence proteins or dyes. HT enables quantitative live cell imaging, and also provides quantitative information such as cell volume, surface area, protein concentration. The label-free imaging and quantification of chromosomes were presented. The regulatory pathway of proteasome degradation by autophagy in cells were studies using HT. = Correlative imaging = HT can be used with other imaging modalities for correlative imaging. For example, a combination of HT and fluorescence imaging enables a synergistic analytic approach. HT provides structural information whereas fluorescence signal provides molecular specific imaging, an optical analogous to PET/CT. Various approaches have been reported for correlative imaging approaches using HT. = Lipid quantification = Intracellular lipid droplets play important roles in energy storage and metabolism, and are also related to various pathologies, including cancer, obesity, and diabetes mellitus. HT enables label-free and quantitative imaging and analysis for free or intracellular lipid droplets. Because lipid droplets have distinctly high RI (n > 1.375) compared to other parts of cytoplasm, the measurements of RI tomograms provide information about the volume, concentration, and dry mass of lipid droplets. Recently, HT was used to evaluate the therapeutic effects of a nanodrug designed to affect the targeted delivery of lobeglitazone by measuring lipid droplets in foam cells. = Experimental Laboratory = HT provide various quantitative imaging capability, providing morphological, biochemical, and mechanical properties of individuals cells. 3D RI tomography directly provides morphological properties including volume, surface area, and sphericity (roundness) of a cell. Local RI value can be translated into biochemical information or cytoplasmic protein concentration, because the RI of a solution is linearly proportional to its concentration. In particular, for the case of red blood cells, RI value can be converted into hemoglobin concentration. Measurements of dynamic cell membrane fluctuation, which can also be obtained with a HT instrument, provides information about cellular deformability. Furthermore, these various quantitative parameters can be obtained at the single cell level, allowing correlative analysis between various cellular parameters. HT has been utilized for the study of red blood cells, white blood cells, blood storage, and diabetes. = Infectious diseases = The quantitative label-free imaging capability of HT have been exploited for the study of various infectious diseases. In particular, parasites-invaded host cells can be effectively imaged and studied using HT. This is because the staining or labeling of parasites requires complicated preparation process and the staining/labeling is not very effective in several parasites. The invasion of plasmodium falciparum, or malaria inducing parasites, to individual red blood cells were measured using HT. The structural and biophysical alteration to host cells and parasites have been systematically analyzed. The invasion of babesia parasites to red blood cells were also studied. Toxoplasma gondii, apicomplexan parasite causing toxoplasmosis, can infect nucleated cells. The alterations of 3D morphology and biophysical properties of T gondii infected cells were studied using HT. = Biotechnology = The cell volume and dry mass of individual bacteria or micro algae can be effectively quantified using HT. Because it does not requires the staining process while providing the precise quantification values, HT can be used for testing the efficacy of engineered stains.  Scientific community  The followings are active scientific conferences on HT, as a part of quantitative phase imaging techniques. * Quantitative phase imaging conference, SPIE Photonics West The HT technique and applications have been included in the following special issues of scientific journals * Special Issue on Quantitative Phase Imaging for Label- Free Cytometry in Cytometry Part A, 2019 * Research Topic on Quantitative Phase Imaging and Its Applications to Biophysics, Biology, and Medicine in Frontiers in Physics  See also  * quantitative phase imaging * digital holographic microscopy * holography  References  Category:Imaging Category:Scientific instruments ","title":"Holotomography"},{"id":"53999581","text":"Arturs Bernotas (born 1 June 1995) is a Latvian chess player.

Fielding (1886-1974Guide to the William John Fielding Papers TAM.069) is a non-fictional book published in 1927 in New York. It deals with the contemporary understanding of sexuality and its relation to the love life in many fields of life. The book consists of 14 chapters and a glossary in which all biological, sexual and medical terms that are discussed in the book itself are defined and explained. The first chapter gives an introduction to different conceptions of the function of sex and mentions cultural influences on these conceptions. Chapter Two deals with the Development of the Love Life and focuses especially on the sex life of the child. Besides that, Man‚Äôs and Woman‚Äôs Sexual Nature are described in Chapter three and four respectively, whereby biological aspects of the male and female reproductive systems are elaborated on in detail. In the fifth chapter the author gives advice about the Preparation of Marriage and in the sixth Chapter Sex Hygiene in Marriage is the topic. Hygiene is not referring solely to personal hygiene but rather to how sexual intercourse can be used to improve marital happiness and satisfaction. Women‚Äôs Love Rights are presented in the following chapter (chapter 8) in which the (at that time) novel notion is described which says that women also have the right to enjoy sexuality. In chapter nine the Birth Control in Relation to the Love Life is being addressed and Chapter nine gives information about The Hygiene in Pregnancy (again not referring solely to personal hygiene). Chapter 10 deals with The Menopause and its symptoms. The following two chapters (11 and 12) present different kinds of Sexual Disorders of Women and Men, respectively and Chapter 13 depicts Venereal Diseases that are being transmitted by sexual intercourse. The last Chapter 14 gives information on the relationship between The Parent and the Child with special focus on sex education.  Structure  Sex and the Love Life by William J. Fielding contains a very detailed and elaborate table of contents on the first few pages of the book which makes it easy for the reader to find the topic that is of interest. Not only the name of the chapter is given but also some important keywords that come up during the chapter. The exact outline appears also at the beginning of each chapter respectively. It might be misleading for the reader to assume that these key points mentioned in the outline refer to actual sub-headings within the chapter. Although the chapters do indeed contain sub-headings, they are not reflected exclusively in the outline at the beginning of the chapter (reference to image). The nine-page glossary (reference to image) at the end of the book gives approximately 180 short definitions of different loan words that may not be familiar to a reader that has no expertise in medicine or biology. They are ordered alphabetically so that they can be looked up easily. Following the glossary, an index is contained at the very end.  Content  = Chapter 2: Development of the Love Life = In chapter 2 of his book, Fielding describes the Development of the Love Life in successive stages from childhood up until adolescence in which the child firstly expresses auto-erotic feelings towards itself. In later development these feelings shift towards a significant other person, usually in the family until the erotic attachment is transferred upon someone outside the family and according to Fielding, usually someone of the opposite sex. It is pronounced that these erotic feelings in the beginning of childhood appear unconsciously and that they are expressed in the pleasure of sucking or rubbing own body parts. Later on, memories of those sexual desires will not be present due to repression. Fielding advises to encourage sublimation in children to channel their sexual energy ‚Äúto outlets that have cultural and social value‚Äù. It is the context of sublimation where Fielding quotes Freud who's opinion was very influential in the 1920s and which can be clearly seen throughout the whole book. Another example would be Fielding's explanation of how adolescents start to become attracted to the opposite sex. According to him, boys will be attracted to women because ‚Äúthe mother is identified with the good things and comforts of life ‚Äú and ‚Äúa woman tends to marry a man resembling her father‚Äù because ‚Äúthe girl child shows a disposition [.] to discriminate in expressing her affections in favour of the father‚Äù. The last part of this second chapter depicts so-called Aberrations of the Love-Life in which, besides fetichism, anti-fetiches, exhibitionism, sadism and masochism, masochism and hermaphroditism, also homosexuality is being mentioned which would appear due to ‚Äúabnormal home conditions‚Äù and a pre-occupation with the same-sexed parent. = Chapter 9: Birth Control in Relation to the Love Life = This chapter deals mainly with the contemporary misunderstanding of contraception in general. All too often it was equalized with abortion and murder of an embryo. Fielding begins with enlightening the reader and explains the advantages of contraception, one of which concerning a moral aspect: ‚Äúa practice which increases marital happiness, which assures people of greater economic security [‚Ä¶] and which permits more extensive educational and cultural advantages to the fewer and better children that are born [‚Ä¶] is a good practice‚Äù. Furthermore, he argues that the fear of pregnancy (as many women experienced at that time) would lead to marital disharmony and that contraceptive methods should be used to establish an unstressed atmosphere between married couples. Fielding also criticizes the church's position towards contraception at that time by saying that ‚Äúthe church [‚Ä¶] has been and still is the most powerful influence against the principle of parenthood by choice instead of accident‚Äù. The institution church would be ignorant of the benefits that contraception offers to the people. The position that is still held by the Catholic Church, namely that ‚ÄúContraception is wrong because it‚Äôs a deliberate violation of the design God built into the human race, often referred to as \\"natural law.\\" The natural law purpose of sex is procreation‚Äú is countered by Fielding as well. He states that humans with their increasing knowledge and skills are already compassing the natural laws, for example by ‚Äúusing artificial light and heat, wearing clothes, [‚Ä¶] and doing a thousand odd other things that are commonplace and proper in our civilization [but are] unnatural‚Äù. He concludes that the view of contraceptive methods must change in society so that the physiological, psychological and social benefits of contraception can be experienced by every individual.  The 1920s and Sexuality  The 1920s, also known as the Roaring Twenties, depict a time of great economic prosperity after the First World War, especially in America. Many people were still conservative about the topic of sexuality, especially due to poor knowledge about sexuality and their own bodies but also because sexual intercourse not intended for reproduction was depicted as sinful by the church. However, the role of women changed: within or after WWI women had to go to work to earn money for their families while their husbands left to join the army which lead to a ‚Äúnear-quality in making money‚Äù. Women got more and more self-confident and independent which also lead to a change in dating and sexual behaviour, away from conservatism and taboos towards more open- mindedness regarding their sexual behaviour. This shift is also promoted by Fielding in his book ‚ÄúSex and the Love Life‚Äù. = Homosexuality = Homosexuality in the late 1920s was slowly being more accepted. However, this did not last a long time and ‚ÄúHomosexuals received a level of acceptance that was not seen again until the 1960s‚Äù. This acceptance was mainly due to the increasing mentioning of homosexuality in entertaining media such as films or songs (see also LGBT History). Nevertheless, in the late 1930s homosexuality was made illegal and declared as a mental illness. It was not until 1973 where ‚Äúthe American Psychiatric Association removed the diagnosis of ‚Äúhomosexuality‚Äù from the second edition of its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM)‚Äù. = Contraception = In the early 20th century contraception was increasingly favoured and accepted (see History of Birth Control) although it was still subject to the discussion if sexual intercourse was meant solely for reproduction or if it was also part of the normal love life between spouses. In his book Sex and the Love Life, Fielding clearly takes a more liberal view and promotes contraceptive methods as they would increase marital happiness and harmony.

In May 2017, he was sentenced to six months of imprisonment by the Supreme Court of India, holding him guilty of contempt of court. He was the first Indian High Court judge to be sent to prison for contempt while in office.  Early life  Karnan was born on 12 June 1955 as Karunanithi Swaminathan in the village of Karnatham, in the Cuddalore district of erstwhile Madras (now Tamil Nadu), into a dalit family. He was the second of eight children born to Chinnaswamy Swaminathan, a school teacher and headmaster, and a recipient of President's Best Teacher Award, and Kamalam, a homemaker. He completed schooling in Karnatham's Adi Dravidar school and a government school in Mangalampet, before completing his pre-university course from Government Arts College, Vridhachalam. Thereafter, he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in botany from The New College, Chennai, and subsequently obtained a Bachelor of Laws degree from Madras Law College in 1983. He changed his first name from Karunanithi to Karnan in 1991, on the insistence of his wife Saraswati due to numerological reasons. Career Upon graduating with a law degree in 1983, Karnan enrolled as advocate before the Bar Council of Tamil Nadu and began to practice civil law. During the time, he was selected as legal adviser to the Chennai MetroWater Supply and Sewage Board, the government advocate in civil suits and also as a standing counsel for the union government. In 2009, Justice Asok Kumar Ganguly, then the Chief Justice of the Madras High Court, recommended Karnan's name to the collegium for appointment as a judge. Despite his work not having known well to the collegium, his appointment was approved by the collegium headed by then Chief Justice of India K. G. Balakrishnan. Speaking about it to The Hindu, Ganguly justified the appointment because \\"he [Karnan] represented a certain community that should be represented in the choice of judges\\", but he, along with other members of the collegium, expressed regret over it later. = Controversies = In November 2011, Karnan wrote to the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) alleging caste-based harassment from other judges of the Madras High Court. Addressing a press conference organized in his chamber, he said that he had faced such \\"humiliation and embarrassment since April 2009\\" and that it still continued. He spoke of a specific incident when a judge \\"touched him with his foot\\". This led to an agitation in the campus of the Court. The then NCSC Chairman, P. L. Punia, had forwarded Karnan's letter to the then Chief Justice of India, Justice S. H. Kapadia. In a controversial judgement in June 2013, he ruled that the promise of marriage for premarital sex would be considered as marriage. He wrote, \\"If a bachelor aged 21 years or above and a spinster aged 18 years or above had pre-marital sex with intention to marry and subsequent to this the man deserts the woman the victim woman can approach a civil forum for remedy after producing necessary substantial evidence to grant her social status as wife. This remedy is not only for the purpose of giving relief to the victim woman but also to maintain the cultural integrity of India.\\" When met with criticism, he clarified that the \\"order does not in any way run against any religion and is not intended to wound any Indian. The order had not in any way degraded the system of marriage performed as per the various religious and customs and rites among the various communities\\". In another controversial incident, in January 2014, Karnan barged into a court room at the Madras High Court during a hearing of a public interest litigation (PIL) before a Division bench of on a matter relating to the appointment of certain judges. He told the bench in open court that the selection was unfair and that he wanted to file an affidavit in his name. The behavior was condemned by the Supreme Court saying, \\"The sudden unfamiliar incident made us fume inwardly at this raw unconventional protest that was unexpected, uncharitable and ungenerous and, to say the least, indecorous.\\" During the time, the then Chief Justice of the Madras High Court, Rajesh Kumar Agrawal, wrote to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, P. Sathasivam, asking him to transfer Karnan to any other High Court. However, Karnan wrote to Sathasivam and Agrawal, stating that he wished to stay on in the Madras High Court, in order to prove the allegations that he had raised against the Chief Justice and the other judges of the Court. Subsequently, Karnan wrote to the joint registrar of the Right to Information section, alleging irregularities in the appointment of district judges. He sought details of the selection process in order to file a complaint before the President of India. In the intervening period, 20 judges of the Madras High Court jointly wrote to the Chief Justice of India requesting Justice Karnan's transfer. In August 2014, when Justice Kaul was appointed as Madras HC chief justice, Justice Karnan launched into a one-man attack against many of the judges. He supposedly hurled accusations at the judges, who fell silent. It is believed that the issue was again based on discrimination. 20 judges sent a memorandum to the CJI asking that Justice Karnan be transferred since they found it difficult to work with him. In 2015, Justice Karnan publicly alleged that another judge had sexually harassed an intern in his chamber ‚Äî an allegation that he has since been unable to substantiate. In late 2015, he wrote a letter to Justice Kaul saying he was going on a long leave because of the ‚Äòdummy cases‚Äô he was being allotted. In February 2016, the apex court transferred him to Calcutta HC. On 23 January 2017, Justice Karnan had published an open letter to the prime minister naming \\"an initial list\\" of 20 sitting and retired Supreme Court and High Court judges, accusing them of corruption. On 8 May 2017, Karnan had sentenced Chief Justice of India Jagdish Singh Khehar and seven other SC judges to five-year rigorous imprisonment after holding them guilty under the SC/ST Atrocities Act-1989 and amended Act of 2015. The Supreme Court on 9 May 2017 sentenced Calcutta High Court judge Justice C. S. Karnan to six months imprisonment for contempt of court. To avoid the contempt proceeding, it was believed while he had fled to Nepal, he was very much present in Kolkata. He finally retired on 12 June and subsequently after a week of his retirement, finally arrested by the Kolkata Police on 21 June 2017 from Coimbatore. He was eventually released from prison on 20 December 2017 after completing his six-month sentence.  References  !‚Çπ!‚Çπ!‚Çπ!‚Çπ!‚Çπ!  External links  * C. S.

Its title translates to Psychology of Work and Career Counseling (Psychotechniques) II Specialized Part (The Practical Application of Psychological Aptitude Tests in Various Careers). Published by Walter de Grunter & Co. in Berlin, it is the second instalment of a series on career counselling. The first volume contains information on the following topics: I. Grundz√ºge der Psychophysik der Berufsarbeit (Basics of Occupational Psychophysics) II. Berufsberatung auf psychologischer Grundlage (Psychology-based Career Counseling) III. Allgemeine Berufsberatung auf Grundlage der Intelligenzpr√ºfung (Career Counseling Based on Intelligence Testing). While the first book highlights the importance of taking aptitude into account while choosing a career, as well as the applications of career counseling in general, the second volume goes further into aptitude testing for specific jobs. The main section of the book lists common occupations of the time, explores which characteristics and skills are vital for success in the respective fields, and finally introduces established tests for these. Often, intelligence tests based on the work of William Stern are used. In effect, it acts as a book of instructions for psychological career counselling. At the time of writing, Swiss-Austrian psychologist and philosopher Dr. Theodor Erismann (1883-1961) was a Professor of Psychology at the Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms Universit√§t Bonn (University of Bonn).https://www.uibk.ac.at/psychologie/geschichte/erismann.html Second author, German psychologist Dr. Martha Moers (1877-1966) was the director of the municipal career counseling for the city of Bonn.  Contents  = I. Eignungspr√ºfungen in den einzelnen Berufen = This section concerns aptitude tests for various, specific careers. #Die Verkehrsberufe covers careers in transportation and traffic, such as Stra√üenbahnf√ºhrer (Tram driver), Kraftfahrer (lorry driver) and Lokomotivf√ºhrer (train driver). Although all three of these careers are very similar, differences in required abilities are still highlighted. For instance, the lack of tracks to guide lorry drivers provides an additional difficulty not present for tram and train drivers. All three careers require fast reaction times, decisiveness, stamina and calmness. Aptitude tests for pilots (Flugzeugf√ºhrer) are also briefly discussed, though the authors note that these are of little use during times of peace, and are included only for completeness sake. #Der Facharbeiter der Metallindustrie concerns testing for workers in the metal industry. #Der Kanzleiangestellte und der kaufm√§nnisch Angestellte covers demands for legal assistants as well as merchants. #Der Schriftsetzer und Buchdrucker goes over ideal characteristics for workers in the printing business, specifically for typesetters and printers. #Die Telephonistin (switchboard operator) is the only career for women covered in the book. #Der Telegraphist und Funker explores available aptitude tests for telegraph and radio operators. #Der Feuerwehrangestellte Firefighting is the only occupation for which medical aptitude tests, particularly concerning breathing patterns, are recommended in addition to psychological ones. Notably, psychological aptitude tests include those meant to assess skittishness, for instance by asking an applicant to perform precise movements (set down a full pail of water) while being exposed to unexpected sounds. #Der Kriminalbeamte concerns the necessary abilities for work as a police officer and detective. #Der Damenfriseur details the skills required by women's hair dressers, such as the ability to perform precise actions with both hands simultaneously. #Psychotechnisch wenig durcharbeitete Berufe: Holzgewerbe, Baugewerbe, Landwirtschaft, Schneiderberuf, h√∂here Berufe This section explores careers and occupations with no or poorly developed psychological aptitude tests. This includes jobs in Lumbering, construction, agriculture, tailoring and dressmaking and academia. Despite the lack of established aptitude tests, potential characteristics to test for are discussed. For example, results from questionnaires completed by vocational school teachers for these careers are presented. For instance, a stock breeder is associated with good eyesight (Sehsch√§rfe) and colour vision (Farbent√ºchtigkeit), well-developed tactile abilities (Feinheit des Tastsinnes), good memory, general intelligence, stamina, cleanliness, an aesthetic sense, as well as the general ability to handle animals. = II. Praktischer Wert und Soziale Bedeutung der Psychotechnik = The second section of the book concerns the practical and social value of psychotechniques. It introduces criteria to assess the actual accuracy of specific tests in predicting future job performance. Criteria include the direct comparison of the performance of workers selected via aptitude testing and those selected without them, a better performance in aptitude tests by those already working in the corresponding career versus those who have no experience, and a correlation between existing employees' job performance and aptitude test performance. Psychologie der Berufsberatung and Career Counseling At the time of publishing, career counselling was a relatively new, but quickly developing field. It is often said to have begun with the publication of Frank Parsons' book Choosing a Vocation in 1909. In Germany, offices for career counselling emerged during the early 20th century, starting with Josephine Levy-Rathenau‚Äôs ‚Äò‚ÄôAuskunftsstelle f√ºr Frauenberufe‚Äô‚Äô (English: Information office for jobs for women) in 1902. ‚Äò‚ÄôPsychologie der Berfusberatung‚Äù, published in 1922, acts as a summary of established findings and accepted tests in the field. Perhaps at odds with career counseling today is the authors‚Äô focus on testing whether an individual is well suited for a specific occupation, rather than performing a series of tests to determine where a client‚Äôs talents lie and offering advice on potential careers based on this. Today, career counselling most often concentrates on this advisory aspect of aptitude testing. Despite the title, Erismann and Moers describe tools for potential employers more than they do tools for self-discovery of one talents. This is also reflected in the notable absence of tests meant to reveal areas of interest rather than just those of talent, as are commonplace in today‚Äôs career counselling. However, despite this particular book‚Äôs apparent lack of focus on the individual and their personal development, other books by the authors‚Äô, particularly Erismann, highlight the importance of a well-chosen profession for overall happiness.

He was appointed by Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on 8 May 2017 and assumed office on 3 July 2017. He previously served as the bank's deputy governor under his predecessor Amando Tetangco Jr. Early life Espenilla was born in Manila, to Nestor Espenilla, Sr. and Arminda Aldave-Espenilla, the only son in a family of five. When he was 10 years old, his mother established a small rural bank, the Rural Bank of San Jacinto (Masbate), Inc., which grew and now has several branches in the province and in neighboring Sorsogon Province. The bank was managed by his three sisters. Education Espenilla graduated from the Ateneo De Manila High School in 1977. He then graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Economics (magna cum laude) from the University of the Philippines in 1981. He also earned his Master of Business Administration honors degree from the University of the Philippines in 1982 and obtained his Master of Science degree in Policy Science from the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo, Japan in 1988. Career After graduating from the University of the Philippines in 1981, Espenilla was hired by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas as a debt analyst. Known to his co-workers as \\"Nesting\\", Espenilla steadily rose through the ranks, earning his stripes in economic research and international operations, before he was appointed by Philippine president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo in 2005 as deputy governor for supervision and examination sector under the administration of his predecessor Amando Tetangco Jr. When Philippine president Benigno S. Aquino III took office in 2010, Tetangco's term would have expired, but Aquino reappointed him and his deputies‚Äîincluding Espenilla‚Äîto their positions. =As BSP deputy governor= As deputy governor, Espenilla was responsible for the BSP's regulatory policies with regards to the entire banking system, playing the \\"bad cop\\" whenever it deals with banks that were revealed to have violated regulations. Among his accomplishments as deputy governor include the closure of Banco Filipino, a major savings and loan bank owned by the Aguirre family, on 17 March 2011 after an investigation by Espenilla's team revealed that depositors' money had been diverted to entities controlled by the bank's owners and officers. Espenilla also ordered the investigation into and closure of LBC Development Bank, owned by the Araneta family that established courier firm LBC Express. It was revealed in the investigation that the bank incurred P6.09 billion in deposit liabilities after a build-up of cash advances to its affiliate businesses. Espenilla also sat as the BSP's representative to the Anti-Money Laundering Council, the Philippines' financial intelligence, financial counter-terrorism and anti-money laundering agency. He sat as chairperson of the council on behalf of Tetangco. One of his key accomplishments as head of the council was the filing of a petition in the Court of Appeals to freeze the bank accounts of former Marcos administration Trade and Industry minister Roberto Ongpin after it was revealed that he allegedly made two behest loans with the Development Bank of the Philippines totaling P660 million to buy the government-owned bank's shares in Philex Mining Corporation. The Appellate Court froze 100 of Ongpin's bank accounts on 6 December 2012 but lifted the freeze order on 7 May 2013. In August 2016, Espenilla ordered the P1 billion-fine against Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation, which is owned by the Yuchengco family. The bank was involved in the 2016 Bangladesh Bank robbery, having been used by hackers to launder and withdraw $81 million which was stolen from Bangladesh Bank's account in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Espenilla also led the establishment of the National Retail Payment System (NRPS), a framework which will be used for the Philippines' gradual shift from cash and check-based payments to electronic means. The shift is expected to improve efficiency in transactions among and between banks and other financial institutions involved in financial technology. =Appointment as BSP governor= Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte appointed Espenilla as BSP governor on 8 May 2017 and assumed office on 3 July 2017. He bested other contenders for the position, including former Philippine President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, fellow BSP deputy governor Diwa Gunigundo, EastWest Bank vice chairman and CEO Antonio Moncupa Jr. and former Trade and Industry Secretary Peter Favila. His selection was hailed as a wise decision by several key personalities in the government and the banking sector, including Tetangco, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III, Security Bank president and CEO Alfonso Salcedo Jr. and ING Bank Manila senior economist Joey Cuyegkeng. Under his leadership, the BSP continued to push reforms under the \\"Continuity Plus Plus\\" theme. Digitalization of the country's retail payment system was also spearheaded under his term. In 2018, under his tenure, Congress passed an act amending the BSP Charter. On February 16, 2019, almost a week before his death, President Duterte signed the act into law effectively \\"strengthening BSP's capacity to foster price and financial stability\\". Personal life Espenilla was married to Maria Teresita Festin-Espenilla, a microfinance specialist for the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and had a daughter and two sons with her. They met at the University of the Philippines while studying for their master's degrees. Espenilla enjoyed his free time either playing golf, bowling, badminton or going to the gym. He also liked going on long walks with his dog (potentially on the beach), watching TV or movies and cooking for his family on Sundays. Death Espenilla died on 23 February 2019 at the age of 60 due to complications brought about by tongue cancer. He had been undergoing cancer treatment for more than a year.

In an interview, band members Ketch Secor and Critter Fuqua described how they had bonded over Dylan's songs as teenagers, and that the 50 Years... project was a natural extension of that collaboration. While the new recording follows the sequence of Dylan's original track-for-track, Old Crow took considerable liberties with the arrangement of individual tracks, for instance reimagining \\"Pledging My Time\\" as a \\"hillbilly breakdown,\\" and \\"Obviously 5 Believers\\" as \\"a manic fiddle riot.\\" The recording was released as an album on April 28, 2017. It was the band's first release on their new label, Columbia Records, which had released Dylan's original album in 1966.

Latin language sources identify him as Christianus Chemnitius.  Life  = Family provenance = Christian Chemnitz was born in K√∂nigsfeld, a small town in the hills to the south of Leipzig. The family was able to trace its origins back to Pritzwalk in Brandenburg where since 1287 they had provided no fewer than sixteen mayors and chief aldermen. The most notable family member in more recent generations was Christian's great uncle, the theologian and reformer Martin Chemnitz (1522-1586). Christian's father was another Martin Chemnitz (1564-1627), a teacher and theologian in K√∂nigsfeld where he had been appointed pastor in 1593. Christian's mother, born Dorothea Jentsch, was the daughter Johann Jentsch, mayor and town clerk of nearby Geithain. Christian Chemnitz grew up in poverty since the land was in a state of permanent crisis thanks to the Thirty Years War and the accompanying heightened plague risk and economic dislocation. = Early years = In June 1626 Christian, by now aged 11, along with his brother Christoph Chemnitz, was relocated to Zeitz, a couple of days to the west, where he attended the school. It was here that he learned of his father's death, in a plague outbreak, slightly less than a year later. In May 1632 he concluded his schooling with a farewell speech \\"de laudibus musices\\" (\\"in praise of music\\") and enrolled at the University of Leipzig. However, he was driven to leave the city by a plague outbreak and transferred to Jena where he arrived on 4 August 1633 with just 16 groschen. = Academic career = At Jena he studied under Paul Slevogt, receiving his \\"Baccalaurat\\" in 1633 and becoming, on 8 August 1637, a Master of Philosophical sciences and Theology. This opened the way to a teaching career that included the Greek, Hebrew and Syrian languages along with Logic, Physics, Metaphysics and Latin Letters. On 14 September 1638 he became Rector of the city's school. In 1643 he moved to nearby Weimar, becoming a deacon. Promotion to the rank of archdeacon in succession to Friedrich Langen, who had died, followed in 1645. In 1647 he moved to Braunschweig, moving again in 1648 to Eisenach where he took a position as an (ecclesiastical) Superintendent. However, before long he turned his back on a career as a church administrator, returning to Jena University where, in 1652, he received his habilitation (higher academic qualification) and became a part-time teacher in Theology (\\"Gottesgelehrtheit\\"), at the same time taking a post as university vice-superintendent. On 13 August 1653 he became a doctor of holy scripture. A series of further university promotions rapidly followed. On his appointment as vice-superintendent, Chemnitz became deputy to a man in his late eighties. In January 1654 Johannes Major died, following which Chemnitz took over his role as superintendent, also taking on the full professorship / teaching chair at the Theology faculty. He also took his share of administrative responsibilities, several times serving as Dean of Faculty. He also served twoOne source states that he served three terms as rector, but does not identify the terms in question. terms as university rector. The office holder was switched twice a year, and Christian Chemnitz held the position during the winter terms of 1655/56 and 1659/60. Christian Chemnitz died in Jena.  Evaluation  In terms of what later emerged as mainstream Lutheranism, Chemnitz's biblical and confessional approach represented a relatively mild form of seventeenth century orthodoxy. Even if his exegetic, dogmatic and devotional contributions have been subsequently superseded, they remain valuable as representative of their times.  Family  Christian Chemnitz was married twice. His first marriage was to Christina Kiesenh√∂fer (1620-1657), daughter of the Jena businessman Johann Kiesenh√∂fer. This marriage resulted in ten recorded children, although seven of these died before reaching their first birthdays, and only two made it to adulthood. Christina never recovered from the birth of her final son, dying eleven days later. His second marriage was to Maria Gerhard. She was by this stage the widow of the former Gotha court physician, Dr. Johann Volck. Maria was also daughter to the noted Lutheran theologian Johann Gerhard. This second marriage resulted in one recorded daughter. This meant that three of Chemnitz's children survived to adulthood: * Eva Chemnitz (born Jena, 1642: died Eisenberg 1703) married firstly 1622 Johann Friedrich Gerhard, Eisenberg superintendent: she married secondly Matthias Jessen. * Samuel Chemnitz (born Weimar, 1652); qualified as a doctor of medicine at Jena in or before 1677. * Sophia Susanna Chemnitz (born Jena, 1659: died 1722) married firstly 1681 Johannes Probst, financier and son of Zwenkau pastor Johann Probst: she married secondly Peter Provonsal, Languages teacher.

After the war, Hawkins joined the British Military Administration as Secretary for Chinese Affairs and Labour Officer, with J. C. McDouall as his assistant. During his services as Secretary for Chinese Affairs, Hawkins managed such issues as tenancy, domestic disputes, issuing of alcohol license, and publication. In 1946, he was awarded Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for the services in connection with the rehabilitation of the colony. He continued his position as Labour Officer, in which the title was changed to Commissioner for Labour in 1947. In August 1947, the Chinese Engineers' Institute launched a strike where the Kowloon-Canton Railway and docks stopped running, the Hong Kong and China Gas Company closed and Dairy Farm stopped producing milk, which caused an immediate jump in food prices, after the engineers' demand of wage increase from $2 to $5 a day was rejected. Hawkins announced all disputes were settled and that basic wages would rise by 50 per cent after negotiations went on for more than a month. In 1948, the rickshaw pullers demanded for rent reduction of rickshaws, in which Hawkins mediated between the pullers and the owners and finally reached a settlement. In 1952, Hawkins was made Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG). In 1955, he was appointed again as Secretary for Chinese Affairs.

This interdisciplinary field is influenced by the psychology and neuroscience of sensation, learning, satiety, and decision making. Areas of interest include how olfaction contributes to flavor, food addiction and obesity, taste preferences, and the linguistics of communicating and identifying flavor. The term neurogastronomy was coined by neuroscientist Gordon M. Shepherd.  Olfaction and flavor  Human olfactory system. 1:Olfactory bulb 2:Mitral cells 3:Bone 4:Nasal epithelium 5:Glomerulus 6:Olfactory receptor neurons Out of all the sensory modalities, olfaction contributes most to the sensation and perception of flavor processing. Olfaction has two sensory modalities, orthonasal smell, the detection of odor molecules originating outside the body, and retronasal smell, the detection of odor molecules originating during mastication. It is retronasal smell, whose sensation is felt in the mouth, that contributes to flavor perception. Anthropologically, over human evolution, the shortening of the nasopharynx and other shifts in bone structure suggest a constant improvement of flavor perception capabilities. After mastication, odor molecules travel through the back of the mouth and up the nasopharynx. The odorants are detected by myriad receptors on the olfactory epithelium. These receptors respond to a variety of dimensions of chemical properties. Odor receptors that respond to a dimension within a molecular receptive range are aggregated by glomeruli in the olfactory bulb. Here, the multi-dimensional nature of odorant stimuli is reduced to two dimensions. This input undergoes edge enhancement, increasing its signal-to-noise ratio by way of lateral inhibition due to mitral cells stemming from the glomerular layer. This input then reaches the olfactory cortex. Here, Hebbian learning networks allow for recall with partial or weak stimuli, indicating the first stage of conscious perception. Here, connections with the hypothalamus and hippocampus indicate that olfaction stimuli affect emotion, decision making, and learning only after significant processing and rudimentary identification.  Decision making  The hedonic value of food and its decision making relies on several concurrent neural processings. The attentional drive to seek and consume food is modulated by homeostatic signaling of hunger and satiety. Habit, social interactions, and nutritional needs affect this signaling. Analysis of non-human primates' orbitofrontal cortex suggests decision making is additionally modulated by food identification, independent of hunger. Activity in the medial orbitofrontal cortex and anterior singulate suggest that an affective value is assigned to every food identification. Hedonic pleasure increases when engaging with food consumption and peaks during satiety. Impairments in these systems greatly impact the ability to resist the urge to eat. Imaging studies show that obese subjects with impairment in dopamine circuits that regulate hedonic value have issues with reward sensitivity and resist functional homeostatic signals that normally would prevent overeating. The consumption of comfort foods can facilitate feelings of relational connection and belonging, and the motivation behind pursuing certain foods can be modulated by social context and environment. Although the consumption of spicy food can cause pain, people in many cultures ascribe a high hedonic value to it. Psychologist Paul Rozin puts forth the idea of \\"benign masochism\\", a learned tendency that overrides the typically aversive stimuli because of the risk-taking or thrill-seeking associated with overcoming pain.  Learned flavor preferences  Learned taste preferences develop as early as in utero, where the fetus is exposed to flavors through amniotic fluid. Early, innate, preferences exhibit tendencies towards calorie and protein dense foods. As children grow older, more factors such as peers, repeated exposures, environments and food availability will modulate taste preferences.  Describing odors  While naming a flavor or food refines its representation strengthens its recall in memory, the patterns and tendencies in word choice to describe flavor suggests limits to the our perception and communication. In describing the flavor of wine, tasters tend to use words that function as a combination of visual and texture descriptors, and references to objects with similar odorant profiles. Color perception heavily influences the word choice describing a flavor; the color of word's semantic reference is often congruent with the food's color when the taster can see the food.

Born in Aalborg, North Jutland to a working-class family, Broby-Johansen grew up in Lunde, Otterup Municipality, Funen. He published a poetry collection in 1922 called Blod (\\"Blood\\"), containing poems on the themes of misery and poverty as well as tabooed topics such as prostitution and necrophilia, was considered scandalous and confiscated by the authorities (re-published in 1968). However, it has gained long-lasting influence in Danish literature by influencing such poets as Michael Strunge http://www.litteratursiden.dk/analyser/broby- johansen-rudolf-blod and Yahya Hassan.

Broby-Johansen ended his political activism in 1935, following the exile of Leon Trotsky and the persecution of Trotskyism in the Soviet Union, and he focused on artistic work. Among his publications on art history are works on costume history and the history of painting. As art historian, he was also responsible for the reconstruction of the colouring of the copy of the greater Jelling stone commissioned in the 1930s, which he dubbed \\"Denmark's baptismal certificate\\".Lokalhistorie fra Syd√∏stjylland, Historisk Samfund for Syd√∏stjylland og bidragyderne (2010), p. 83.

He returned to political activism in the 1960s in support of Maoism and the Chinese Cultural Revolution, and in the 1970s he campaigned against the accession of Denmark to the European Communities.

Hackley House is a house located at 484 West Webster Avenue in Muskegon, Michigan, USA. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1970, and is now part of the Hackley and Hume Historic Sites, and is open to the public. History Charles Henry Hackley was born in Indiana in 1837. He moved to Muskegon in 1856, along with his father Joseph, and began work as a laborer in the local lumber mills. He was soon promoted to foreman, and then became a bookkeeper. In 1859 Charles and Joseph Hackley started their own firm, J.H. Hackley & Company. By 1881 Charles Hackley partnered with Thomas Hume to run the very successful lumbering firm of Hackley and Hume. By this time, Hackley had diversified his business interests, and was the leading financial and industrial presence in Muskegon. (Note: large pdf file) In 1887, Hackley began making plans to for his house by purchasing lots on the corner of Webster and Sixth. He immediately sold one and one-half of these lots to his business partner, Thomas Hume, who constructed his own house on these lots. Hackley engaged David S. Hopkins of Grand Rapids to design his house, and the local firm of Kelly Brothers to create the elaborate interior woodwork. The house was completed in 1889. Hackley died in 1905, and the house remained in the family until 1943, when it was donated to the Red Cross. As of 2017, the Hackley and Hume houses have been professionally restored, and are open to the public as the \\"Hackley & Hume Historic Sites.\\" Description The Hackley House is a large three-story frame Queen Anne house with a three-story tower at the corner and a two-story porch. The elaborate 13-color exterior paint scheme has been reconstructed from the original tones. It has a many- sided roof with prominent gables and a porte-cochere in front. The windows are a mix of shapes, including horseshoe and round; some are made from French plate glass and decorated with stained glass. The house sits on an ashlar foundation. At the rear of the house is a carriage house, which is shared with the next-door Hume House. On the interior, the house is richly ornamented. The entrance doors and trim in the entrance hall and main rooms include extensive carved, turned, and molded details. These include colonnades, spindles, panels of acanthus leaves, and small figures, all of fine craftsmanship. Ceramic tiles and fabrics are also used to decorate some of the walls. The designs in the decorative elements contain themes covering Byzantine and Cambodian art, Michigan timber, and the brotherhood of man.

It was borne by the descendants of Chinese officers, who were high- ranking, Chinese civil bureaucrats in the Dutch colonial government, bearing the ranks of Majoor, Kapitein or Luitenant der Chinezen (see: Kapitan Cina). Kan Hok Hoei Sia (first row, second from left) with other members of the Volksraad. A Sia, Kan was descended from Han Bwee Kong, the first Dutch- appointed Kapitein der Chinese of Surabaya. History As with other Chinese honorifics, the title 'Sia' came at the end of the title holder's name: for example, as in Oey Tamba Sia (1827 - 1856). The title was used not with its holder's surname, but with his given name, so Tamba Sia instead of Oey Sia. In everyday speech, use of the title was often combined with other honorifics, such as Ako Sia ('elder brother Sia') or Baba Sia ('sir Sia'). Originally, the honorific was used in Imperial China to address certain senior mandarins, the relatives of a mandarin or descendants of the House of Koxinga, formerly the ruling dynasty of the Kingdom of Tungning. In colonial Indonesia, the honorific came to be used as a hereditary title for the descendants of Chinese officers, who were seen as the colonial Indonesian equivalent of the Chinese mandarinate and scholar-gentry. These title holders and their families constituted the so-called Cabang Atas, the traditional Chinese establishment or gentry of colonial Indonesia. As a class, they dominated the administrative posts of Majoor, Kapitein and Luitenant der Chinezen, or the Chinese officership on a near-hereditary basis. To a significant extent, they also monopolised the colonial government's lucrative revenue farms, which formed the economic backbone of their political influence. To preserve and consolidate their power, families of the Cabang Atas contracted extensive, strategic intermarriages within their social group. In the later colonial period, it became fashionable among western-educated title holders to refrain from using the title 'Sia', which was seen as an old-fashioned anachronism. This mirrored the decline in the importance of the Chinese officership as a government institution in the early twentieth century, which presaged its eventual abolition in most of the Dutch East Indies with the exception of the colonial capital, Batavia. Indeed, as pointed out by Monique Erkelens, the prestige of the traditional elite declined in the early twentieth century due to changing political and ideological circumstances in late colonial Indonesia and early twentieth-century Asia. Title holders An engraving of Oey Tamba Sia (after M. G. de Coudray, 1857) As part of the Cabang Atas, Sias played an important role in the history of Indonesia, particularly in relation to the country's ethnic Chinese community. Prominent Sias include: * Han Chan Piet, Majoor der Chinezen (1759 ‚Äì 1827): government official and landlord * Han Kik Ko, Majoor der Chinezen, Regent of Probolinggo (1766 ‚Äì 1813): government official and landlord * Lim Ke Tjang, Kapitein der Chinezen of Tegal (1781 ‚Äî 1826): official, shipping and sugar magnate * Tan Eng Goan, 1st Majoor der Chinezen of Batavia (1802 - 1872) * Oey Tamba Sia (1827 - 1856): notorious Batavia playboy * Lie Tjoe Hong, 3rd Majoor der Chinezen of Batavia (1846 ‚Äì 1896) * Phoa Keng Hek Sia (1857 - 1937): social reformer and philanthropist * O.

It roughly runs north-south direction along of the barrier spit of land along the lower Sandy Hook peninsula between the Atlantic Ocean and the Shrewsbury River estuary. The use of seawalls, groins, jetties, bulkheads, revetment, and beach nourishment since the late 1800s has made the stretch of coast one of the most heavily engineered sections of ocean shorefront in the world. The effects of Hurricane Sandy wrought serious damage to the area in 2012. The reconstruction of the seawall, including new construction of in gaps where it had not previously existed began in 2017 and will be completed in 2018. The storm precipitated reconsideration of seawalls and other methods of coastal protection to mitigate storm surges and sea level rise along the coast. Geography and jurisdiction USACE New York-New Jersey harbor estuary map 2016 The Sea Bright communities of Navesink Beach, Normandie, Downtown, and Low Moor and the northern portion of Monmouth Beach, known as Galilee, are located on the barrier spit of land south of the Sandy Hook peninsula (part of the Gateway National Recreation Area) between the Atlantic Ocean and the Shrewsbury River estuary. The peninsula is generally wide with an elevation of between and and forms western approach to the Port of New York and New Jersey. The seawall begins south of the Highlands ‚Äì Sea Bright Bridge and lies between the beach and Route 36, locally known as Ocean Avenue, which is part of the New Jersey Coastal Heritage Trail Route. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) Division of Coastal Engineering is responsible for coastal protection along the Jersey Shore based on the New Jersey Shore Protection Master Plan developed in 1981. The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) New York District coordinates the projects. In 2016 the USACE and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey produced a comprehensive restoration plan for the extended harbor region, which included proposals to mitigate the effects of sea-level rise through projects to restore natural areas. In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy in 2012 funding for seawall reconstruction has been provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Seawall 1920s Along Route 36 in 2015 Development of the area began in the 1860s when the coast became a resort. Since then the use of seawalls, groins (jetties), bulkheads, revetment, and beach nourishment has made the stretch of coast one of the most heavily engineered sections of ocean shorefront in the world. As described by geologist Orrin H. Pilkey the beaches have been \\"New Jerseyized\\", meaning to say that the beaches have (at one time or another) all but eroded completely leaving seawalls or the detritus of previous ones. New Jersey Southern Railroad built a 2,000-foot trestle and a seawall on the ocean side of the narrow peninsula in the 1870s, and rebuilt it again in 1881. To protect Fort Hancock the U.S. Army constructed a seawall between Sandy Hook and Sea Bright in 1898. At times there was not beachfront between Sandy Hook and Long Branch. The seawall was built in phases between 1914 and 1962. The parent of NJS, the Central Railroad of New Jersey abandoned the property in 1950. The state did not opt to buy the strip of land that had been the railroad's right of way. The state built a new seawall starting in 1946 into the 1950s. By the late 1980s, the seawall had seriously deteriorated and repairs were undertaken in 1990. The region has experienced serious storms and hurricanes including those in 1938, 1944, 1950, 1955, 1960, 1962, 1972, 1976, 1984, 1985, 1991. Hurricane Sandy in 2012 devastated the shore. As of 2015, the funds allocated for the project to repair and/or replace the seawall was $34,827,594.00, 90 percent of which came from Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), with the State of New Jersey funding the remaining 10 percent. The reconstruction of the seawall, including new construction of in gaps where it had not previously existed is set to begin in 2017. The height of the wall is approximately . Beach nourishment USACE Coastal Storm Risk Reduction efforts in the NY-NJ region include projects along the shore at Sea Bright and Monmouth Beach Since the Ash Wednesday Storm of 1962 beaches along the shores of the East Coast have been regularly replenished with sand pumped in from off-shore. A multi-year project in for replacing sand began in 1994 by the USACE and originally completed in 2001 and been renourished 4 times since then. After Hurricane Sandy, approximately 5 million cubic yards of sand from the beaches in the area were washed away. The USACE in 2014 replaced more than 8 million cubic yards of sand thus restoring the project area to its original design profile. The practice has become controversial due to environmental and economic concerns. Beach access Privately owned decks atop the seawall must provide public linear passage along it The parent of NJS, the Central Railroad of New Jersey abandoned the property in 1950. The state did not opt to buy the strip of the land that had been the railroad's right of way. Parts of the land came into the hands of private property owners. As outlined in the Public Trust Doctrine, public access is the \\"ability of the public to pass physically and visually to, from and along the ocean shore\\", including perpendicular and linear access. Beach access on and beyond the seawall has been unclear or contentious in Sea Bright and less so in Monmouth Beach. A 1993 agreement between the State of New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and nine private beach clubs in Sea Bright allowed easements along club's oceanfront for replenishment project. that expanded narrow strip to broad sandy field. The general public was only permitted to walk along 15-foot swath of sand above the water line, but not otherwise use the beach. In 2010, the Superior Court of New Jersey voided the agreement. After an appeal one club which had contested was also ordered by the Appellate Court to comply.

According to the Royal Flemish Academy of Belgium for Science and the Arts, which presented her with an award in 2003, she was \\"the main Flemish literary editor of the twentieth century\\" and her publishing house has \\"undoubtedly left its mark on the history of Flemish literature\\". Biography She was born in Dinant, her father was a textile manufacturer from Lille and her mother was Belgian. In the late 1920s, she studied chemistry at the Universit√© libre de Bruxelles (ULB) (Free University of Brussels in English) for a while. During these years she rented a room in a Dutch couple‚Äôs house, Jan Greshoff - journalist, critic and poet - and Aty Brunt, where she learned Dutch and discovered Dutch literature. She worked a few years for the publisher Alexander Stols, and then in 1932 founded the Algemene Importhandel A Manteau. Six years later, with the financial backing of the Dutch publisher Robbert Leopold, she launched her own publishing house: A Manteau NV. From 1938 to 1970 the Manteau list included the following Flemish writers: Johan Daisne, Louis Paul Boon, Hubert Lampo, Piet van Aken, Hugo Claus, Jos Vandeloo, Ward Ruyslinck, Jef Geeraerts, Paul Snoek, Karel van de Woestijne, Herman Teirlinck, August Vermeylen. In the 1960s, she launched the Dutch author Jeroen Brouwers, who had worked since 1964 for the publishing house as secretary and then as editor. In the late 1970s, she left the publishing house, which, since 1965, had joined the Dutch group Van Goor, and worked for Elsevier in Amsterdam. The Manteau editions however continued their activities. In the 1970s and the first half of the 1980s, Julien Weverbergh, who had previously been hired by Ang√®le Manteau as the head of the Vijfde Meridiaan series of paperback books, headed the company. In 1986, Ang√®le Manteau became a member of the Order of Orange- Nassau. In the same year King Baudouin granted her the title of Baroness. In 1998, the former publisher transferred some of her personal literary archives to the National Library of the Netherlands, based in The Hague. Another part was then deposited at the Letterenhuis (\\"House of Literature\\") in Antwerp, where the archives of the Manteau editions are kept. On 13 December 2003, the Royal Flemish Academy of Belgium for Science and the Arts awarded her their Gold Medal. Ang√®le Manteau died on 20 April 2008 at the age of 97 in a hospital in Aalst.

It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1972, and is now part of the Hackley and Hume Historic Sites, and is open to the public. History Thomas Hume (1848-1920) arrived in Muskegon from Ireland in 1870. In 1872, he joined Charles Hackley's lumber firm as a bookkeeper. (Note: large pdf file) In 1881 Charles Hackley and Thomas Hume became partners in the very successful lumbering firm of Hackley and Hume. (Note: large pdf file) As the lumber business declined, both Hackley and Hume diversified into other manufacturing and financial interests. In 1887, Hackley purchased a series of lots on the corner of Webster and Sixth. He immediately sold one and one-half of these lots to Thomas Hume, and then constructed his own house on these lots. Hume engaged architect David S. Hopkins (who also designed Hackley's house) to design his home. It was completed in 1888. The Hume family expanded the house after the turn of the century, adding a library, dining room, and sleeping porch. Thomas Hume lived in this house until his death in 1920. In the early 1950s, the house was sold to a day care center, and in 1971 ownership was transferred to the Hackley Heritage Association.

They have been performing since the 1960s. History The Hamilton County Bluegrass Band was founded in Hamilton by Alan Rhodes and Paul Trenwith. Their main influence was the music of Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs from the Blue Grass Boys. Dave Calder, who was studying at the University of Auckland, liked the sound and became their mandolin player. The called themselves Muleskinners and started performing in 1966. Classical violinist Colleen Bain met the group in 1967 and joined the band as its fiddle player. Leonard (Len) Cohen and Sandy McMillin, joined to complete the lineup. After producer Bryan Easte saw them performing at folk festivals and local music venues he invited them on to his television show, ‚ÄúThe Country Touch.‚Äù This forced them to decide on a name and eventually Hamilton County Bluegrass Band was chosen. Their first album, self titled, was released in 1967, and their first successful single was ‚ÄúBarefoot Nellie‚Äù/‚ÄùI‚Äôll Never Hold You In My Arms Again.‚Äù Four further albums were released in 1968 and 1969, the last featuring Bill Clifton. Capitilising on their success the Hamilton County Bluegrass Band turned professional in 1968, signing on with HMV. McMillin was replaced by Lyndsay Bedogni. In 1970 their single ‚ÄúCarolina On My Mind‚Äù/‚ÄùRoll Muddy River‚Äù was a finalist in the Loxene Golden Disc Awards. A year later the ‚ÄúHey Boys‚Äù/‚ÄùProud Mary‚Äù single also made it into the finals. These two singles were included on the ‚ÄúFifth Season‚Äù album. Leonard Cohen and Lyndsay Bedogni decided to pursue other interests and to leave the band, and Miles Reay (bass) joined. Cohen emigrated to Adelaide, Australia continued playing bluegrass, concentrating on the dobro in bands such as Old South and Crooked Road. In 1971, Hamilton County Bluegrass Band released ‚ÄúLive At The Wynyard Tavern.\\" The band changed to the Columbia label and released two singles, ‚ÄúYou‚Äù/‚ÄùGentle Ways Of Loving Me‚Äù and ‚ÄúMercedes Benz‚Äù/‚ÄùOld Times (It‚Äôs Easy To Forget)‚Äù came out on. Calder then left for England and Graham Lovejoy became the new mandolin player. They also were convinced to relocated to Australia and regularly toured with iconic Australian country musician, Slim Dusty. The Hamilton County Bluegrass Band also travelled to the USA in the 1970s. They recorded \\"For you\\" and ‚ÄúKersbrook Cottage‚Äù in Sydney under Columbia. In 1974 the band decided it was time to slow down and moved back to New Zealand. They still appeared on \\"Country Road\\" occasionally and released an album titled after the show. In 1975 they recorded one of their signature songs. ‚ÄúOrange Blossom Special.‚Äù Paul and Colleen, now husband and wife, left not long after. This effectively ended the band, although a final album called ‚ÄúOrange Blossom Special‚Äù was released in 1978. Paul and Colleen Trenwith recorded four albums under their names between 1976 and 1986. In 1993, a 25th Anniversary compilation called ‚Äú1968 To 1973‚Ä≥ was released.

A Dark so Deadly was the first novel in a run of seven books for Stuart MacBride not to have debuted at number one in the book charts. Plot Detective Constable Callum MacGregor is in the Misfit Mob. This is where Police Scotland deposit their outcasts, troublemakers and those whom it wishes to get rid of but cannot. Callum is in the Misfit Mob because he screwed up the forensics at a crime scene which allowed a known killer to walk free from court. Everyone thinks he accepted a bribe from the killer to deliberately contaminate the scene. Trouble is, MacGregor didn't ruin the crime scene; it was his pregnant girlfriend who was on her last warning, which would have meant her getting sacked and not receiving maternity leave or pay. So MacGregor takes the blame earning him the job in the Misfit Mob. Whilst there, he has to deal with police finding his mum's remains (25 years after she went missing), finding out that his long lost twin brother is a rapper with an attitude and a fake accent and a serial killer who is mummifying his victims.

The Rockets compete in the Men's NBL1 North and play their home games at Adani Arena. The team is affiliated with Rockhampton Basketball Inc., the major administrative basketball organisation in the region. Team history =Background= Rockhampton Basketball Inc., originally known as the Rockhampton Amateur Basketball Association, was formed in March 1962. Frank Howie, the coach of the first Rockhampton team to compete in a Queensland championship in 1961, was elected the inaugural secretary of the association; while John Hegvold, a member of that inaugural team, was the foundation vice-president of the association. Rockhampton's basketball stadium, formerly known as Hegvold Stadium, was designed by John's father Eddie and had its grand opening in December 1962. The facility was named in honour of Eddie. =Early days of the Rockets= 1986 saw the formation of the Queensland State Basketball League (QSBL) with both a men's and women's competition. Rockhampton Basketball subsequently entered a team into both competitions‚Äîthe Rockets joined the Men's QSBL, and the Cyclones joined the Women's QSBL. The Rockets were unsuccessful in claiming their maiden title during the moniker of the QSBL, as they failed to reach the championship game over the first eight seasons of the competition. In November 1993, the QSBL joined the Continental Basketball Association (CBA) and became the association's North Conference in 1994; Rockhampton was one of 12 teams in the conference's inaugural season. =First Championship= In 1995, the Rockets made their way through to their first ever grand final, where they were defeated by Southern Districts. The following year, they returned to the grand final and won their maiden state championship with a victory over Southern Districts in the title game. =Championship dynasty= The Rockets endured a championship drought between 1997 and 2007, as they made a lone grand final appearance in 2006 that saw a defeat at the hands of Southern Districts. On 17 August 2008, swingman Ben Thompson starred in the Rockets' 97‚Äì80 grand final victory over the Townsville Heat to claim the Warren Berginey Cup and their first QABL state championship in 12 years. In an inspirational performance, Thompson hit a game-high 30 points, including six-of-eight three-pointers, collected eight rebounds and three assists on his way to MVP honours. Two weeks later, the Rockets celebrated the city's first national championship after a courageous 103‚Äì99 victory over the Hobart Chargers in the grand final of the 2008 Australian Club Championships at the Melbourne Sports and Aquatic Centre. Centre Ryan McDade was named grand final MVP after recording 24 points and 19 rebounds. The Rockets went on to qualify for six straight QBL Grand Finals between 2009 and 2014, winning titles in 2010, 2013 and 2014. Former NBL player Peni Nasalo was key to the Rockets' 2010 championship‚Äîin his first season with the Rockets, the experienced guard was one of Rockhampton's best, guiding the Rockets to grand final glory against the Mackay Meteors. The 2013 Rockets squad was stacked with NBL talent, with their starting line-up consisting of point guard Mitch Philp, shooting guard Justin Watts, small forward Brad Williamson, power forward Stephen Weigh and centre Michael Kingma. They reached the 2013 QBL Grand Final with ease, where they defeated the Brisbane Capitals 102‚Äì95. Philp took out the game MVP award for his effort of 26 points including six three-pointers and eight from 10 free throws, in addition to seven assists and two steals. Heading into the 2014 season, the Rockets set their sights on creating a dynasty by winning back-to-back championships for the first time in team history. They were successful in doing so behind the leadership of American forwards Chehales Tapscott and Ray Turner, as the Rockets took out the best-of-three grand final series in a clean sweep, defeating the Mackay Meteors 2‚Äì0. Turner took out the MVP award for Game 2 for his efforts of 31 points and 15 rebounds. =NBL1 North= For the 2020 season, the Rockets joined the newly-established NBL1 North, which replaced the QBL.

SRGBV is widely spread around the world and is common in many societies. Millions of children and families suffer from this type of violence. Incidents related to SRGBV has been reported in all countries and regions of the world.  Scale  Many governments and organizations around the world are working towards getting reliable information regarding SRGBV, as it has been proved to be an urgent matter that should be solved. Based on all the data related to SRGBV around the world collected, it is important to try to find solutions in order to tackle this problematic. For instance, UNICEF's report Hidden in Plain Sight included the largest collection of data relating to violence against children. As aforementioned, this report proofs how physical and sexual abuse takes place at schools.UNICEF. 2014. Hidden in Plain Sight: A Statistical Analysis of Violence against Children.

Cyberbullying, School Bullying, and Psychological Distress: A Regional Census of High School Students. American Journal of Public Health, Vol. 102, No. 1, pp. 171‚Äì177.  Root causes  Social beliefs influence gender relations in all countries of the world. In this sense, the root of violence against children depends on social construction and how the populations behave vis-a-vis gender-related issues. Some of the root issues include: * Gender discriminatory norms: These promote the belief according to which men are more powerful than women and that they can prove their power because they are stronger. In many societies, dominant gender norms prevail and influence people. LGBTI people, who do not follow these gender norms often suffer from violence if they do not comply with these norms. Indeed, many people often consider LGBT people as not \\"proper\\" and judge them inciting violence against this group. * Use of violence to show power: Authority is often shaped by held beliefs that promote male domination among women. At the school level, this implies male and female teachers are more powerful that children, perpetrating the belief that teachers have power over children. Then, authority is reinforced and maintained. * Other factors include income inequality, as it is a proof of social constraints. Moreover, social media, online grooming and trolling ‚Äì also facilitate violence among children, as this spaces are difficult to track down by the police. * Schools and the education system in general follow a specific social and structural framework. The dynamics of the education sector produce and reproduce environments potentially dangerous for children. It is the system itself which unintentionally exposes children to types of violence that might at times replicate, reinforce or recreate power dynamics followed by the society and the people belonging to this. There are several actors in society who are responsible for participating in and creating these dynamics, including policy-makers, authority figures, teachers, parents, other students and others. In order for these dynamics to change, a lot of effort is required at schools and in society in general.  Consequences  Being exposed or having experienced SRGBV can have critical impacts on children's development. Especially in terms of mental and physical well-being, including children's health (HIV and early pregnancy). It has been demonstrated that victims of violence are more likely to accept aggressive types of behaviors or be violent themselves after suffering from violence.Heise, L. 2011. What works to prevent partner violence? London, STRIVE, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. http://strive.lshtm.ac.uk/system/ les/attachments/What%20works%20to%20 prevent%20partner%20violence.pdf This creates a vicious circle in which violence becomes wrongly acceptable. SRGBV can have negative and long-term consequences for the future of young people, as it forges their adult personalities. = Physical health and health risk behaviour outcomes = * Injuries, including bruises, burns, fractures, gun wounds and stabbings * Lacerations and abrasions * Disability * Genital- urinary symptoms * Unwanted pregnancy * STIs including HIV * Eating disorders * Substance misuse * Risky sexual behaviour = Mental health outcomes = * Anxiety * Depression * Anger or hostility * Low self-esteem * Suicide ideation, attempts and actual suicide * Self-harm * Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) * Shame * Obsessive-compulsive disorder * Dissociation * Loss of memory = Educational outcomes = * Lack of concentration * Inability to study * Falling grades * Disruption in class * Non-school attendance * Dropping out of school  Challenges of addressing SRGBV  Addressing SRGBV raises important challenges and is very complex. The concept is not understood by many and is considered sensitive for many. Actors from the education sector, governments and policy-makers and individuals attending schools face several challenges regarding SRGBV. These include: = Social cultural norms = Reporting on SRGBV situations around the world has become especially difficult since social and cultural norms do not promote this practice. Moreover, implicitly they discourage it. Many actors from society including teachers; school directors and policy-makers still avoid talking to children openly about gender; violence and sex. They fear promoting sensitive materials to children because of the taboo present in society. Work, time and patience are required to overcome set-ideas promoted by parents within their communities. It is necessary to start real and honest dialogues with children in order to create guaranty real and long-lasting results. = Gender inequality = Gender inequalities refer to the devaluation and discrimination of women an girls in a society. This results on giving more power to men and boys, while demeaning women and girls. For instance, a study in Ethiopia highlighted that even though 93 per cent of male students recognized violence against girls to be illegal, about 33 per cent thought it is acceptable for male students to have what they want, and appeal to their charm or force to get. 21 per cent recognized behaving this way.ActionAid. 2004. Stop Violence against Girls in Schools. London, ActionAid. = Capacity constraints = Capacity constraints in education systems, are also responsible for slowing down the progress related to preventing SRGBV. One of the most important challenges is the training of teachers with the tools and sensitivity to teach curriculum against violence and promote gender equality. In order for real change to happen, it is necessary to introduce these new tools slowly, analyzing who is the best to communicate these elements and what skills and knowledge are needed. What's more, having enough resources will be very important to implement change. = Weak coordination and monitoring mechanisms = Another factor that limits the progress related to stopping SRGBV is weak coordination and unreliable monitoring mechanisms. These render difficult the collaboration between ministries of education, police, social services, child protection and more. This is important because if this collaboration is not fluent, it will be difficult to stop SRGBV. A renewal in the organization's cultural landscape will be needed to overcome challenges, including bureaucracy that disrupts the flow of knowledge sharing. = Weak service support for victims = Limited access to quality services, including child protection an social services among others (often absent) are due to the quality of services. This particularly concerns fragile communities. = Lack of governance = In the majority of countries, there is currently no legislation that protects children from violence at school, meaning not much can be done when it happens. However, it is the case that some countries have recently introduced legislations specifically for schools. This said, legislation related aspects have become a real challenge. As to stop SRGBV, perpetrators must be punished. = Limited evidence = Emerging, but limited, evidence base on what works, although this is an area that is receiving increasing attention. The few evaluations of SRGBV interventions that currently exist vary greatly in methodology, rigour, scale and scope. This makes it difficult to identify best practice and draw conclusions about effective strategies that can be transferred to other settings. There is also a growing body of promising practices and existing knowledge that has not yet been fully documented. = Insufficient data and research = As previously mentioned, many challenges slow down the reporting and impact on the quality of providing reliable data regarding certain types of violence. This implies data is incomplete in contexts such as sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, and disability among others. This is important as all of these contexts are important to fight against SRGBV. According to a recent study by USAID, to tackle SRGBV it is necessary to rely on large-scale studies which include findings that can be compared across countries; studies showing different forms of SRGBV, connections between behavior change and a discrepancy between research and practice. It is necessary to invest in strong data management system tools which divide data and will make it easier for people to analyze it.RTI International. 2016. Literature Review on School-Related Gender-Based Violence: How it is Defined and Studied. Washington, DC: U.S. Agency for International Development.  Six guiding strategies for national action  = Leadership: Laws, policies and education reform = Governments should demonstrate leadership at the national level by: * developing and implementing laws to protect children from violence, ensuring accountability and treating all children equally * adopting a comprehensive, multisectoral national policy and action plan to prevent and respond to SRGBV * strengthening connections between education and child protection policies, procedures and systems * reforming the education system for an enhanced and holistic response. = Environment: Ensuring schools are safe and supportive = In order to render schools safer, it is important to adopt whole-school approaches that will create better environments for children. Also different types of stakeholders at the school level should become engaged at local communities and government. There are three specific strategies: * creating safe and welcoming spaces * ensuring governing bodies and school management send strong messages that SRGBV is not acceptable and is taken seriously * developing and implementing codes of conduct. = Prevention: Curriculum, teaching and learning = At the education sector level, students should be taught in a certain way and certain topics. In order to prevent SRGBV, it is important to: * curriculum approaches that prevent violence and promote gender equality * training education staff to give them the tools to prevent and respond to SRGBV * safe spaces where co- curricular interventions can be a useful entry point for addressing SRGBV. = Responses: In and around schools = * When SRGBV does occur, there should be clear, safe and accessible procedures and mechanisms in place for reporting incidents, assisting victims and referring cases to the appropriate authorities. Key strategies include: * providing easily accessible, child- sensitive and confidential reporting mechanisms * providing counseling and support * referral to law enforcement and healthcare services. = Partnerships: Collaborating with and engaging key stakeholders = SRGBV being a very complex issue, it is necessary to involve many and several types of stakeholders. Thus it is about creating partnerships in order to tackle SRGBV: * coordination/collaboration between key ministries as well as at the district level * partnerships with teachers‚Äô unions * participation of girls and boys * working with families and the wider communities * engaging civil society organizations. = Evidence: Monitoring and evaluation = * National action should be informed by research and data on SRGBV, including: * formative research on SRGBV to inform policy and programme development * comprehensive national data collection systems * indicators to track progress * evaluations to assess impact.

The book deals with the phenomenon of sexual inversion, a contemporary term for homosexuality. It is part of Ellis' seven-volume series Studies in the psychology of sex. The book has seven chapters describing the prevalence, nature and theories in the 19th century about sexual inversion in men and women. Various case studies are presented and discussed. Ellis recognised a need to address the topic of sexual inversion especially in England: However, the publication of the book was suppressed in England at first and it was published in the United States instead. Historical context \\"Homosexual practices in private, between two consenting parties, are absolutely unpunished [...]\\" in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and other European countries. In the 18th century sex between men was a topic that was discussed publicly. Sodomy, any form of sexual activity that does not involve penile penetration of a vagina, was long criminalised. It was decriminalised in France during the French Revolution. Other countries also adopted this forcefully or by choice, including Austria, Russia and Brazil. In England, anal penetration of men and women as well as mutual masturbation for man was still sentenced even when it occurred privately, with consent and no involvement of minors. Ellis proposes making homosexual practices legal. He rejects the fear of the state that the legalisation of homosexuality will increase its prevalence. The book was the first major work on the topic in England and also breaks with previous works on homosexuality because it contains middle-class characters as protagonists and regards most cases of sexual inversion as congenital. This challenged the conception of the inverted identity as a bad character with a lack of self-control. Publication For the book Ellis worked together with John Addington Symonds. Symonds was a secret homosexual who lived abroad. Their correspondence happened via letters and after Symonds' death, Ellis was not able to find a publisher for his book in England because they all feared prosecution. Therefore his book Studies in the psychology of Sex Vol. 1 was first published in (Germany) as Das kontr√§re Geschlechtsgef√ºhl in 1896. Later, an American company published the book in English. However, the book was suppressed by many British authorities who made sure that copies would not be sold in Britain. A bookseller who sold copies of the book in Britain was charged and pleaded guilty. Symonds' family also wished to suppress the book to protect their reputation. Content =Introduction= The prevalence of homosexuality is investigated as well as several observations of homosexual costumes from different cultures. In the Montana Indian culture, for example, men that are attracted to other men are called bot√©. An observation by Dr. Holder describes these men as dressing and acting like women from childhood on, followed by sexual practices after puberty. Also, some men of great intellect, as the author describes it, like the Roman Emperor Caesar or the French Humanist Muretus are known to have had some homosexual tendencies. The author concludes that all these cases suggest a form of sexual inversion which is congenital but there is no evidence for it. =Chapter II, the study of sexual inversion= Chapter II deals with various scholars who had previously studied homosexuality. Among them is Carl Friedrich Otto Westphal a German psychiatrist from Berlin who proposed that sexual inversion is something innate and not acquired and is not necessarily a sign of insanity. Attempts to classify forms of sexual inversion are also discussed for example one proposal by Richard Krafft-Ebbing a psychiatrist and author of Psychopathia Sexualis. =Chapter III, sexual inversion in men= Chapter III describes how sexual inversion may manifest in men and presents various case studies. An undifferentiated sexual feeling toward men is considered normal until puberty. The cases are classified into the following: simple sexual inversion with our without intercourse, cases that practice masochism, prisoners and men integrated in society and psychosexual hermaphrodite. The cases are reported either by the men themselves or by doctors. =Chapter IV, sexual inversion in women= Ellis notes that homosexuality is as common in women as in men. However, it is little known about sexual inversion in women, which is also reflected in the presence of only four case studies in this chapter. The true sexual invert is described and an inverted woman is distinguished from an actively inverted woman who appears to be more masculine. A genuine criterion seems to be the indifference of inverted women toward men which is returned by them. Furthermore, the author suspects that the prevalence of homosexuality among women is increasing which he explains by emancipation and equal rights movements. In the last part the high prevalence of homosexuality among prostitutes is addressed. =Chapter V, the nature of sexual inversion= This chapter is an analysis and summary of the earlier case studies. Sexual inversion in the cases presented seems not to be heritable. Records of inversion or other abnormalities are not conspicuously frequent among the case studies. Most of the subjects have good general health. In most of the subjects the homosexual instinct appeared in early life without a previous affection for the opposite sex. Ellis associates precocious puberty with sexual inversion. Ellis excludes suggestion as a cause of sexual inversion. Also, masturbation in male cases is reported as predisposing to inversion whereas there was no such relationship observed for the female cases. Most of the subjects are adverse towards sexual relationships with the opposite sex. However, there are close and genuine friendships between sexual inverts and members of the opposite sex. Many subjects investigated by Ellis show artistic talent. Lastly, most of the subjects regard their sexual inversion as being equal to heterosexuality so they do not think that their sexual instinct is immoral. =Chapter VII, the theory of sexual inversion= Ellis attempts to define several terms and clarify the terminology around the topic of sexual inversion. The definition of sexual inversion itself is according to Ellis highly dependent on context. Ellis clarifies that although sexual inversion might be both acquired and congenital, it is primarily congenital. The normal sexual instinct is inborn and not acquired, and sexual inversion is a natural variety of sexual instinct. It is also compared to color-blindness and color hearing, all of these phenomena being classified as abnormalities. It is also stressed that abnormality need not imply morbidity or disease; it is a mere variation of the normal. Three types of inversion are distinguished: congenital predisposition to sexual inversion which remains latent, very strong predisposition and a weaker predisposition that can be excited by a powerful cause. Suggested causes include the co-education of boys and girls, the seduction by an older person and disappointment in normal love. However, Ellis also stresses that in most of the cases sexual inversion was present from childhood on and was more of the strong predisposed type. =Chapter VIII, conclusions= In the conclusion Ellis first examines the treatment of Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing who was a German physician, psychiatrist and notable psychical researcher in the field of paranormal events. The cure included 150 sessions of hypnosis for one year as well as frequent drunken visits of the brothel. Ellis qualifies this treatment as not successful and concludes: ‚Äú[...] the remedy seems to me worse than the disease [...].\\" It seems to Ellis that it is not possible to \\"cure\\" the sexual invert but that there should be an effort made to help them being healthy, self-restrained and self-respecting to be functional members of society. The legal situation of homosexual practices is also described. The book contains the following appendices: * A Homosexuality among Tramps by Josiah Flynt * B Ulrich‚Äôs View by \\"Z‚Äù * D Countess Sarolta V * E A note on sexual inversion by Dr. K Influence and reception The studies in the psychology of sex vol.1 is an example of a more diverse view of sexuality from the Victorian era. The article by Historyextra concludes that The book was not published in England because it was noted that homosexual practices increase in Europe and as a consequence. Canadian-born British feminist, socialist, sex radical, and birth control campaigner Stella Browne, in her review of Volume II, says \\"England has already impoverished herself intellectually and covered herself with ridicule by the persecution of the original edition of this psychological classic.\\". It is even said that the social system in Britain is a cause that artificially stimulated sexual inversion because it is a system that suppresses the normal sexual instinct. In the scientific community Ellis' book was well-received. Ellis' contribution to the study of sexual inversion is recognised as relevant and useful. Although the conclusions due to a lack of data they already lead to an understanding of the fact that it does not make sense to try to change the instinct of sexual inverted people. It was also recognised that inversion is not necessarily linked with physical or mental disease. Moreover, the cases presented by Ellis possess great intellect and are therefore an important part of society. Browne desires the legalization of homosexuality as in France and Latin Europe. To others however, Ellis suggestion of a more relaxed law concerning homosexuality is not convincing because of the reported efficacy of the present law. Browne criticises the lack of examples of female sexual inversion as well as the hypothesis that in bisexuals homosexual tendencies are stronger than heterosexual tendencies. The importance of publishing a book about sexual inversion is acknowledged. The lack of understanding of the topic had adverse consequences on the life of homosexual people. Homosexuality was heavily stigmatized and illegal in English society at the time. Ellis \\"has collected new data, and undoubtedly done a service to pathological psychology.\\" Reading is regarded as necessary for teachers, people working with criminals and parents to prevent sexual inversion from occurring.

(Updated June 24, 2019) The motto of the organization is Nos iungat ambulare (\\"May walking bring us together\\").  History  IML has its origins in the annual International Four Days Marches Nijmegen, Netherlands, organized by the Dutch KNBLO (now the KWBN). The success of this event and the increasing number of foreign walkers led, from the late 1960s, to the KNBLO helping to set up similar annual events in other countries. These include H√¶rvejsmarchen in Viborg, Denmark; Marche international de Diekirch in Diekirch, Luxembourg; the International Four Days Walks in Castlebar, Ireland; and the Two Days March of Bern, Switzerland. In 1977 the Japan Walking Association established the Japan Three Day March, the first annual non- competitive walking event outside Europe. In 1986 the multi-day walking event organizations of Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland agreed to form the International Marching League, which was officially founded in 1987. Since then, membership has steadily increased, with the United Kingdom represented by the International Waendel Walk in Wellingborough since 1990, and new events organised in the Far East, Australia and New Zealand. In 2006, the general meeting of the participating organizations decided to take the current IML Walking Association title. (Accessed April 8, 2020)  Activities  IML Medaille The IML Walking Association promotes a series of walking events in 29 countries, subdivided into the European Region (including Israel) and the Pan Pacific Region (including Canada and the USA). (Accessed April 8, 2020) Normally, there is only one authorized IML event per member country, but a second can be accepted under certain conditions, in particular if it is held at a sufficient distance from the first and in a different topography. New member events can be admitted if they have been held for three years and offer routes over a minimum distance of 20 km per day. They are first accepted as a candidate event and then as a member event by the IML General Meeting. (Accessed April 8, 2020) Some events have been discontinued in the meantime. Walkers participating in IML affiliated events may buy a \\"passport\\" in which successful participation is recorded, and may also obtain medals and certificates based upon the number of completed walks. (Accessed April 8, 2020) Each walking event has a minimum duration of two days, with a minimum daily distance of 20 km to count towards IML awards. Most events also offer walks over shorter and longer distances. In the tradition of the Four Days Marches of Nijmegen which started as a training event for the Dutch military, the IML events are also attended by military units.

She was said to be the eponym of Mycenae.Fowler, pp. 236, 259; Tripp, s.v. Mycene, p. 387; Smith, s.v. Mycene.  Sources  Homer's Odyssey, calling her \\"Mycene of the fair crown\\" mentions her in passing, along with Tyro and Alcmene, as \\"women of old ... fair-tressed Achaean women\\".Homer, Odyssey 2.120. Pausanias, citing the Megalai Ehoiai, says that Mycene was the daughter of Inachus and the wife of Arestor, without naming the mother.Fowler, p. 236; Pausanias, 2.16.4 = Hesiod fr. 185 Most, pp. 262, 263. However a scholiast on Homer's Odyssey says that Mycene was the daughter of Inachus and the Oceanid nymph Melia, and that, according to the Epic Cycle, Mycene and Arestor were the parents of Argus Panoptes.Fowler, p. 236; Nostoi fr. 8* (West, pp. 160, 161) = Scholiast on the Odyssey 2.120. As the daughter of Inachus, she would have been therefore the sister of Phoroneus, who, according to Argive tradition, was the first man, or first inhabitant of Argos, who lived during the time of the Great Flood, associated with Deucalion.Hard, p. 227; Gantz, p. 198. According to Pausanias--among several accounts of how the city Mycenea got its name--one was that Mycene gave \\"her name to the city\\".Pausanias, 2.16.4. According to Pausanias, 2.16.3, Perseus was also said to have named the city after myces, the Greek word for mushroom, which also referred to the cap on the end of a scabbard (see Fowler p. 259); this was because, on the spot where he founded the city, either \\"the cap (myces) fell from his scabbard, and he regarded this as a sign to found a city\\" or upon pulling a \\"mushroom (myces) from the ground\\" a wonderous spring gushed forth from which he \\"drank with joy\\". Pausainas, 2.16.4, also mentions (but discounts) the story that the eponym of the city was Myceneus the son of Sparton, son of Phoroneus. For other stories explaining the name of the city, see Fowler, p. 259.  Notes   References  * Fowler, R. L.

Greg Kennelty of Metal Injection commended Manson and Tyler Bates' use of dynamics on the song, writing that each musician ‚Äì through their respective vocals and production ‚Äì throw \\"punches only when [they] need to. Why waste all your energy going full force when there's a more subtle and effective tactic of getting what you want? After all, you rarely need aggression when aiming straight for the jugular.\\" Release and promotion On the day of the 2016 US presidential election ‚Äì November 8 ‚Äì Manson released a short teaser video for the song via The Daily Beast. The video was created by Final Girl director Tyler Shields. It featured images of the vocalist tearing pages out of a Bible and brandishing a bloodstained knife whilst standing over a decapitated corpse lying in a pool of blood. Numerous publications noted that the corpse was dressed in attire similar to the kind regularly worn by Donald Trump‚Äîa suit and red tie. Manson later dismissed these connections, saying: \\"Well, there was no actual decapitation shown. It was implied. And no Trump. There was just a guy in a red tie. Could have been a preacher. It's funny that people see what they want to see.\\" Despite this, Aaron Klein alleged in an article which appeared on the far-right organization Breitbart News, that the head of the decapitated corpse which appeared in \\"Say10\\" was later used by Shields in another project: a controversial photo-shoot featuring stand-up comedian Kathy Griffin, which saw her holding a ketchup-covered Styrofoam replica of Trump's severed head. Music video A full version of Shields' teaser video has never been released. The official music video for the song was directed by Bill Yukich, and was uploaded onto YouTube shortly after the release of Heaven Upside Down. This video co-stars Johnny Depp, with Depp and Manson portraying Cain and Abel, respectively. The video was inspired by horror films such as The Exorcist (1973), The Evil Dead (1981) and A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), the latter of which starred Depp. It begins with the two sitting on their respective white and black thrones whilst surrounded by several naked women covered in satanic symbols. Cain appears in full white face paint and a matching suit, although he is invariably stained with black make-up; Abel sits on his throne while wearing black leather, his face stained by white make-up. After leaving a possessed Bible outside the door of an apartment building, Abel begins sexually assaulting several of its occupants. The hauntings become gradually more aggressive, culminating in a hooded figure chasing a woman down a tunnel with a knife. Following this, several of the naked women recreate the Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima photo using an inverted Cross of Lorraine, apparently ending the possession. The video ends with Abel committing suicide by slitting his own throat with bloodstained money. The video has received generally positive reviews from critics. Paul Cashmere said that it \\"perfectly demonstrates the irrelevance of MTV in the 21st century\\", writing that it saw Manson using \\"creativity, shock and horror to tell a story, knowing full well that traditional media wouldn't be able to touch this. The video is brilliant in its architecture and strategy.\\" Brandon John of Australian publication ToneDeaf praised Depp's appearance, writing that the \\"creepiness [quotient is] a step or two above anything Depp has done throughout his long resume of Tim Burton flicks.\\" Credits and personnel Credits adapted from the liner notes of Heaven Upside Down.

In the days of timber rafting it was periodically opened and washed the fallen logs or timber rafts downstream into the valley. Today the dam acts as a bridge over the Schwarzenbach.  Technology  Until 1844 a wooden splash dam (Schwallung) stood on the same spot. Because it took a great deal of maintenance, however, it was replaced under the direction of Weisenbach master stonemason, Belzer, with a dam made of bunter sandstone that is still there today. The individual stones were very precisely carved and laid without any mortar and the structure was finished with perfectly fitting, wedged keystones. The dam stands at a valley floor height of roughly , is about 20.5 metres wide at the foot, 67 metres long and can store 20,000 to 25,000 cubic metres of water.Max Scheifele: Die Murgschifferschaft ‚Äì Geschichte des Flo√ühandels, des Waldes und der Holzindustrie im Murgtal.

Timber transportation  Upstream view of the gates The logs for timber rafting were hauled down tracks (Lotwegen) from the mountains to the rafting pond (Flo√üstube) on the valley side of the splash dam by horses and stored there. By suddenly opening the two lock gates, the logs floated into the Murg valley. Rafters (Flo√üknechte) freed any jammed logs using raft poles (Flo√üstangen). This work on the raft was dangerous and drew onlookers from the surrounding area, for example from the nearby town of Baden-Baden. Further downstream on the Murg in Gernsbach and H√∂rden the logs were roped together into timber rafts and floated down to the River Rhine, where they were combined into larger rafts that were hauled to Holland for sale.

The line previously known as North Borneo Railway Line.  History  Following the large demands of tobacco prior to the industry success in 1880, there was a great demand for lands for the tobacco plantation. The process to transport the produce was hardened due to lack of transportation. In 1894, following the appointment of a director and managing director for the North Borneo Chartered Company; the involvement of William Clark Cowie become crucial for the establishment of railway systems in North Borneo. Already in the early months of his involvement, Cowie had commenced work on telegraph line and the railway; with a vision to connect the east and west areas of North Borneo through the forests, mountain ranges, rivers and swampland. An English civil engineer, Arthur Joseph West was then appointed to establish the railway line from Bukau in the north of Beaufort and south to Weston. At the same time a ferry service have been established between Beaufort North to Beaufort South to carry passengers and cargo across the Padas River. A train passing the Pengalat Railway Tunnel between Kawang and Papar. View from Kawang side. Papar railway bridge. A new port in Brunei Bay was established under the name of West. It was only discovered soon in 1890 after the completion of railway lines there that the area in Weston are too shallow to be made for a deep-sea wharf; resulting to his ambition to link the whole areas of North Borneo only an ambition. The plan was also met with financial problems as the construction required a large sum of money to be wholly financed by the company and majority of the officials did not show a real enthusiasm over the plan. Cowie however persisted and raised a further ¬£200,000 in 1901 through the issue of debenture stock. The next year, the company rejected further request from Cowie's to borrow ¬£500,000 more as the plan would cause them bankruptcy. This result the line only managed to be finished until Melalap as Cowie's plan could proceed no further. = Modernisation = Following the end of British rule in North Borneo, the railway management then came under the Sabah State Railway after the territory become part of Malaysia. To rejuvenate the line, the state government hired Suria Capital Holdings Bhd and Hikmat Asia to revamp the whole line at a cost of RM300 million ($594 million); with the largest concession goes to SP Setia with the firm began work on the vast Aeropod project to modernise the main railway station in Tanjung Aru that will be equipped with apartments, office towers, mall and a hotel. On 23 February 2019, Sabah Industrial Development Minister Peter Anthony said the Tenom- Melalap rail service in western Sabah will be revived with Chief Minister Shafie Apdal will officiate the starting of the construction on 31 March. The ground breaking ceremony was moved to 1 April instead which also involving the establishment of Melalap town. Around RM10 million has been allocated by the state government for the 15 kilometres railway line connecting Melalap with Tenom town. Through the meeting of the Sabah State Legislative Assembly on 16 April, Minister Anthony further told that another line with a length of 175 kilometres that will connecting Kudat with Kota Kinabalu are under preliminary study stage which expected to be ready in the end of the year.

The EGAD initially began work on the standard between 2012 and 2016, with a conceptual model (RiC-CM) and an ontology (RiC-O) released for comment during 2016. Content The Conceptual Model aims to bring together the Council's current descriptive standards, namely the General International Standard Archival Description (ISAD(G)), International Standard Archival Authority Records ‚Äî Corporate Bodies, Persons, and Families (ISAAR(CPF)), International Standard Description of Functions (ISDF), and International Standard Description of Institutions with Archival Holdings (ISDIAH). RiC also aims to be better suited to the management of electronic records than previous standards, whilst still supporting traditional analogue materials.Cooper, Carl, Researchers, practitioners and their use of the archived web. IIPC Web Archiving Conference 15th June 2017. (2017) [accessed 3 August 2017]. It defines the primary descriptive entities of the model, and how these interrelate within archival description. RiC also aims to modernise the aging current standards, by enabling archival description to better capture the complex relationships records have with each other, and with their creators, holders, and subjects. These groups, individuals, and organisations are referred to as \\"agents\\" in RiC. Through these relationships, RiC aims to provide a richer descriptive context than the hierarchical structure of ISAD(G). Response The conceptual model was published for comment in 2016. Among the responses, some have shown confusion as to how it should be applied in practice. A consultation meeting of the Archives and Records Association's Archives and Technology group expressed uncertainty over how the conceptual model should be interpreted by the profession, and how they would engage with and benefit from it in the future. In their response, the InterPARES Trust state that a more inclusive development process should have been used given the potentially international application of the model, referring especially to the under-representation of Africa and Asia (acknowledged by EGAD in their introduction to the RiC-CM). Their response also questions the integration of the entire suite of current ICA descriptive standards without first gauging the extent to which these are currently implemented globally. OWL Ontology The EGAD has published an OWL ontology called RiC-O to represent RiC-CM in version 0.1 in december 2019, 2019-12-12..

It now houses the Amazon Apartments. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. History The city of Muskegon was built on the lumber trade. However, in the early 1890s, the lumbering business in the area came to an abrupt halt, with lumber shipments from the area plummeting by over 90%. The Muskegon Chamber of Commerce, alarmed at the economic impact on the area, devised an incentive plan to lure new businesses to the city. The plan included financial help to new companies based on employment, and a free building site if employments gains were realized. In 1895, George W. Powell of the Amazon Hosiery Company of Michigan City, Indiana, agreed to move the company's factory to Muskegon. A single-story brick building was constructed on Western Avenue to house the factory. (note: large pd file) However, the company struggled at its new location, and in 1897 lumber barons Charles Hackley and Thomas Hume rescued the company, paying $100,000 to gain controlling interest. They reorganized it as the Amazon Knitting Mill and changed their product line. The company began to prosper, and by 1899 employed 650 people. A new four-story brick addition to the factory was constructed that year. The company continued to flourish during the first part of the twentieth century, and operated well into the Great Depression. However, the onset of World War II siphoned off labor and supplies needed to keep the plant operating, and in 1943 the plant was shut down and the company's assets sold off. The building stood empty until 1945, when one portion was leased to ACDelco, a division of General Motors. Over the next several decades, a number of different businesses moved in and out of the building. In 1993, plans were drawn up to convert the building into mixed residential and commercial spaces. This project was completed in 2001, and as of 2017 the building houses the Amazon Apartments. The building contains 118 apartments and has 98,000 square feet of retail and office space on the ground floor. Description The Amazon Hosiery Mill was constructed in two segments. The eastern segment, now apparently demolished, was a single-story, L-shaped building measuring 240 feet in length and 110 feet in width. It had a two-story square tower at the corner. The larger western section is a four- story U-shaped brick structure with a hipped roof, measuring 240 feet by 200 feet, with sections 70 feet wide. The central block of the U features projecting brick pilasters separating rectangular window openings. Two square towers are placed at the corners of the structure. The eastern tower is five stories tall and is topped by a series of rounded arch windows and a hipped shingle roof. The western tower is six stories high and has two bands of round arched windows located on the fourth and sixth stories. The fifth floor of this tower originally housed a clock, now removed.

Originally built as a single-family house in 1901 and expanded via a number of additions, it is notable as a well-preserved example of the small boarding houses and apartment buildings that housed much of Albuquerque's working-class population in the early 20th century. The building is listed in the New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties and the National Register of Historic Places. History The building was constructed in 1901 by John Newlander, a carpenter and manager of the Albuquerque Planing Mill Company. The Albuquerque Citizen described it as a \\"fifteen room residence, two story brick with modern convenience\\". Newlander built the house himself at a cost of $6,000. It was located in the Atlantic and Pacific Addition, which at the time was the western fringe of the city. By 1916, Newlander's wife Lula had converted the house to a four-unit apartment building. The apartments were typical of the small boarding houses and apartment buildings, mainly converted single-unit dwellings, that served Albuquerque's working-class inhabitants in the early 20th century. with Multiple additions at the rear of the building gradually increased the number of apartments to 14 by 1946. Between 1932 and 1941, the apartments operated under the name Fifield Apartments. The building continued to function as apartments into the 1990s, although its condition deteriorated. Eventually it was purchased by the city for redevelopment and has since been restored. The property was added to the New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties in 1999 and the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. Architecture The Newlander Apartments are two and a half stories in height with a hip roof, exemplifying the \\"hipped box\\" style. The front of the building has a full-width, two-story porch with turned wood supports and balustrades and bracketed cornices. The asphalt-shingled roof is punctuated by four dormers, one on each side. The rear dormer has a shed roof and the other three are gable roofed. The interior has a central hall plan with high ceilings and many original details.

He lives and works in Beyoƒülu, Istanbul.  Work  In his work, √únal focuses on oil painting and drawings. √únal uses the effect of deformation in his paintings and refers to ideas of the French philosopher Gilles Deleuze and the American artist Jackson Pollock. His work revolves around the dualism between the chaos around human beings and inside them. His portraits are often based on abstract-expressionist improvisation. √únal seeks to understand the feeling of not belonging to anywhere, a body without organs or identity and the wish to flee. Whereas his portraits have been perceived as characters with worries, √únal prefers an interpretation of an architectural structure with dual identities. √únal also worked as street artist in cities like Istanbul and Athens. In his large wall paintings, he deforms faces and expressions to give emotional asset a different language.

The novel is about a group of robots and humans living on a planet called the End of Nothing. Their mission is to search the universe and other dimensions to seek out true religion and knowledge. They add the information they gather to their Pope, a robotic supercomputer, in order to make an infallible authority of all knowledge and religion. The novel was nominated for both a Hugo Award for Best Novel and a Locus Award for Best SF novel in 1982.  Plot  On a desolate planet named the End of Nothing at the edge of the galaxy, a group of robots and their human assistants form the religious institution called Vatican 17. This group is engaged in a secret project to create the ultimate infallible Pope a supercomputer robot containing all knowledge that can be gathered from this universe and other dimensions. Some of this information comes from human psychics called Listeners who can travel mentally to other planets and dimensions. Their experiences are recorded on ‚Äúknowledge cubes‚Äù and eventually fed into the Pope. Based on the Pope's interpretation of all knowledge both material and spiritual the robots hope to establish a truly universal religion. A religious crisis occurs when one of their listeners called Mary claims to have found heaven. The ‚Äútheological faction‚Äù of robots petition to have Mary canonized. But another robot faction doubts the authenticity of Mary's heaven. The Vatican fears an end to the search program. Mary is taken ill and cared for by the newcomer Dr. Jason Tennyson. When he arrives on the planet he quickly befriends Jill Roberts, a reporter who wants to write a formal history of the Colony. While exploring the new planet Tennyson meets Thomas Decker, who is usually accompanied by Whisperer. Whisper is a member of a species who were native to the planet. He has the ability to speak to Decker and soon finds out that he can communicate telepathically more easily with Tennyson than with Decker. Decker tells Tennyson that he thinks he knows where Mary's heaven is. Meanwhile, Decker is murdered by one of the theological faction robots in order to keep its location secret. Tennyson Jill and Whisperer discover the location of Mary‚Äôs heaven from the equation people, aliens from another dimension. They met several unique and strange aliens, including a triad of aliens consisting of a haystack with 13 eyes, a bubble named Smokey and octopus-like creature in constant Motion nicknamed Plopper. To their surprise, they also meet Decker or rather a duplicate of him. Mary's heaven turns out to be a type of center for galactic studies that collects physical samples of life forms from all over the galaxy. Tennyson and the others struggle to get back to Vatican with proof that Mary‚Äôs heaven is this galactic library, not the real heaven. The group is transported back to the End of Nothing, including the triad of aliens, thus providing proof that Mary‚Äôs heaven is not the real heaven.

Several theories have been proposed for its purpose. Only the core of the structure remains today.  Description and history  The structure is known as Minar (, literally \\"pillar\\") or Minaret () in New Persian, while the medieval Arabic-language Islamic sources referred to the structure as Terbal ( ·π¨irbƒÅl). Similar structures, i.e., staged tower with an outside ramp, have been recorded by ancient historians, including a tower mentioned by Ammianus Marcellinus at the Nahar Malka (near the Sasanian capital Ctesiphon; he compared it to the Lighthouse of Alexandria), several towers at Pirisabora (al-Anbar) mentioned by Zosimus, and the Borsippa tower near Babylon. These in turn may have been based on the ziggurats of the ancient Near East. Ardashir I's new city of Gor had a circular plan with the official buildings located at the centre of an inner circle in radius. The tower-like structure of Terbal was located at the very centre of this circle. Together with Takht-e Neshin, these are the only structures of the city that are made of granite-mortar-masonry. According to Iranica, these two structures may have been confused in medieval Islamic sources, and it is unclear that the names AywƒÅn kiyƒÅkhurra () (Istakhri), Gunbad-i Kƒ´rmƒÅn (or Gƒ´rmƒÅn; ) and ƒ™rƒÅn Garda/Girda () (Ibn al-Balkhi) mentioned in these sources refer to which structure. Terbal was a square structure with more than high and spiral in design. It was the core of a stair-tower, and was compared by Ibn Hawqal to a similar edifice at Balkh (a reference to a Buddhist stupa, or possibly a ziggurat). With the width of the destroyed stairs and outer walls added, its actual width is estimated to be about . The remaining structure is hollow, according to the Qajar period writer Forsat-od-Dowleh Shirazi. Ernst Herzfeld (1907) had described it as a tower of a square ground plan with a spiral outer ramp.\\"\\" According to Dieulafoy (in his L'Art Antique de la Perse), who had examined the structure, it was \\"composed above the platform, of four stages ... Each stage is square and recedes from the preceding one by a space equal to of the base\\".

Prior to Ernst Herzfeld studies of the structure, Terbal was mistakenly thought to be a descendant of the ziggurat, while some thought it is a fire temple, with the Holy Fire (Atar) being put at its top to avoid contamination with dust. It is hypothesised that the structure may have been part of a government building and symbolised the divine and centralist kingship introduced by Ardashir I. It may have had practical military and civil uses as well, as the tower provided visual contact with some fortifications in the area, and/or may have been used as an observation tower to survey activities during the implementation of the planned scheme of the new city of Gor and the plain. In fact, this grand scheme was centred in Terbal and continued the concentric and radiant pattern of the town, with traces of canals, paths, walls and field borders found up to 10 km distance from this central tower. According to a newer study, the structure, as also described in medieval sources, may have functioned as a water tower, in such a way that water from nearby elevated sources would flow through tubes and Terbal's hollow core towards its dome, and from there it would be flowed to another tube to flow elsewhere in the town. It is argued that it was not the only purpose of the structure, but it was also part of a temple of Anahita, the divinity of the Waters (aban).ŸÖŸáÿ±ÿ¢ŸÅÿ±ŸäŸÜ ÿ±ÿ∂ÿßÿå ÿÆÿ±ÿßÿ¥ÿßÿØŸä ÿ≥ÿ±Ÿàÿ±ÿå ÿ¨ÿßŸÖŸá ÿ®ÿ≤ÿ±⁄Ø ÿπÿ®ÿßÿ≥ÿå ¬´ÿßÿ±ÿØÿ¥Ÿäÿ± ÿÆŸàÿ±Ÿá: ÿ™ÿÆÿ™⁄ØÿßŸá ÿßÿ±ÿØÿ¥Ÿäÿ± ŸæÿßŸæ⁄©ÿßŸÜ¬ªÿå ŸæŸäÿßŸÖ ÿ®ÿßÿ≥ÿ™ÿßŸÜ ÿ¥ŸÜÿßÿ≥: ÿ®Ÿáÿßÿ± Ÿà ÿ™ÿßÿ®ÿ≥ÿ™ÿßŸÜ 1392ÿå ÿØŸàÿ±Ÿá 9ÿå ÿ¥ŸÖÿßÿ±Ÿá 19ÿå ÿµÿµ 107‚Äì120.  Influence  It is thought that the Terbal was the architectural predecessor of the unique minaret of Great Mosque of Samarra (also known as the malwiya) in Iraq, which was built in the Abbasid period. The minaret itself inspired that of the Mosque of Ibn Tulun in Cairo, Egypt, and recently Philip Johnson's design for the 1976 Chapel of Thanksgiving at Thanks-Giving Square in Dallas, Texas.

Built about 1785, it was home to one of the early innovators in the development of silver plating, and was (as of the 2010s) still owned by Cowles descendants. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. Description and history The Whitfield Cowles House is located in a rural-residential area of southern East Granby, on the north side of Spoonville Road just east of its junction with South Main Street (Connecticut Route 187). It is set facing south on a short stub of an abandoned colonial-era roadway, near the southern edge of a mainly wooded parcel. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a side gable roof, end chimneys, and a clapboarded exterior. Its most prominent feature is a two- story Colonial Revival portico, which extends across the center three bays. It has four fluted Doric columns, which rise to a narrow frieze and dentillated cornice. A balcony, partially supported by the central two columns is set under the portico and over the main entrance. The entry is like the portico an early 20th-century alteration, with flanking sidelight windows. The interior follows a central hall plan, with a single-run staircase. The interior decoration is a mix of Colonial Revival and Georgian-Federal late 18th century elements. The house was built about 1785, probably by Joseph Griswold Jr., who sold the house and to Reverend Whitfield Cowles in 1802. Cowles did not receive adequate financial support from his congregation, and eventually turned to other business endeavours to supplement his ministerial pay. He was dismissed from his position over political differences in 1808, and devoted himself entirely to business. With partners, he established a nearly complete textile operation, and also produced carding equipment and other tools. A major initiative of his was the establishment of a wire factory not far from his home. He soon began experimenting with electroplating silver, a pursuit his son William developed after he died. He partnered with silversmiths based in Hartford for the manufacture of silver-plated spoons, eventually expanding to a wide array of domestic silverware. By the mid-1840s Cowles was shipping his products as far off as South Carolina. However, the business was laden with debt, and eventually failed. Some of Cowles' partners and employees went on to more successful development of the technology, leading Connecticut to become a center of silver-plate manufacturing by the late 19th century.
