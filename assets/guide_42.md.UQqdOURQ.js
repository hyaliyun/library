In nonlinear control theory, the birth of a hidden oscillation in a time-invariant control system with bounded states means crossing a boundary, in the domain of the parameters, where local stability of the stationary states implies global stability (see, e.g. Kalman's conjecture). If a hidden oscillation (or a set of such hidden oscillations filling a compact subset of the phase space of the dynamical system) attracts all nearby oscillations, then it is called a hidden attractor. For a dynamical system with a unique equilibrium point that is globally attractive, the birth of a hidden attractor corresponds to a qualitative change in behaviour from monostability to bi-stability. In the general case, a dynamical system may turn out to be multistable and have coexisting local attractors in the phase space. While trivial attractors, i.e. stable equilibrium points, can be easily found analytically or numerically, the search of periodic and chaotic attractors can turn out to be a challenging problem (see, e.g. the second part of Hilbert's 16th problem). Classification of attractors as being hidden or self-excited To identify a local attractor in physical or numerical experiment, one needs to choose an initial system‚Äôs state in attractor‚Äôs basin of attraction and observe how system‚Äôs state, starting from this initial state, after a transient process visualizes the attractor. The classification of attractors as being hidden or self-excited reflect the difficulties of revealing basins of attraction and searching for the local attractors in the phase space. Definition. An attractor is called a hidden attractor if its basin of attraction does not intersect with a certain open neighbourhood of equilibrium points; otherwise it is called a self-excited attractor. The classification of attractors as being hidden or self-excited was introduced by G. Leonov and N. Kuznetsov in connection with the discovery of the hidden Chua attractor for the first time in 2009 year. Similarly, an arbitrary bounded oscillation, not necessarily having an open neighborhood as the basin of attraction in the phase space, is classified as a self-excited or hidden oscillation. thumb Chaotic self- excited attractor (green domain) in Chua's system. Trajectories with initial data in neighborhoods of two saddle points (blue) and zero equilibrium point (orange) tend (green) to attractor. thumb Chaotic hidden attractor (green domain) in Chua's system. Trajectories with initial data in neighborhoods of two saddle points (blue) tend (red arrow) to infinity or tend (black arrow) to stable zero equilibrium point (orange). Two hidden chaotic attractors and one hidden periodic attractor coexist with two trivial attractors in Chua circuit (from the IJBC cover) = Self-excited attractors = For a self-excited attractor, its basin of attraction is connected with an unstable equilibrium and, therefore, the self-excited attractors can be found numerically by a standard computational procedure in which after a transient process, a trajectory, starting in a neighbourhood of an unstable equilibrium, is attracted to the state of oscillation and then traces it (see, e.g. self- oscillation process). Thus, self-excited attractors, even coexisting in the case of multistability, can be easily revealed and visualized numerically. In the Lorenz system, for classical parameters the attractor is self-excited with respect to all existing equilibria and can be visualized by any trajectory from their vicinities; however for some other parameters values there are two trivial attractors coexisting with a chaotic attractor which is a self-excited one with respect to the zero equilibrium only. Classical attractors in Van der Pol, Beluosov‚ÄìZhabotinsky, R√∂ssler, Chua, H√©non dynamical systems are self- excited. A conjecture is that the Lyapunov dimension of a self-excited attractor does not exceed the Lyapunov dimension of one of the unstable equilibria, the unstable manifold of which intersects with the basin of attraction and visualizes the attractor. = Hidden attractors = Hidden attractors have basins of attraction, which are not connected with equilibria and are ‚Äúhidden‚Äù somewhere in the phase space. For example, the hidden attractors are attractors in the systems without equilibria: e.g. rotating electromechanical dynamical systems with Sommerfeld effect (1902), in the systems with only one equilibrium, which is stable: e.g. counterexamples to the Aizerman's conjecture (1949) and Kalman's conjecture (1957) on the monostability of nonlinear control systems. One of the first related theoretical problems is the second part of the second part of Hilbert's 16th problem on the number and mutual disposition of limit cycles in two- dimensional polynomial systems where the nested stable limit cycles are hidden periodic attractors. The notion of hidden attractor has become a catalyst for the discovery of hidden attractors in many applied dynamical models. In general, the problem with hidden attractors is that there are no any general straightforward methods to trace or predict such states for the system‚Äôs dynamics (see, e.g. ). While for two-dimensional systems hidden oscillations can be investigated using analytical methods (see, e.g., the results on the second part of Hilbert's 16th problem), for the study of stability and oscillations in complex nonlinear multidimensional systems numerical methods are often used. In the multi-dimensional case the integration of trajectories with random initial data is unlikely to provide a localization of a hidden attractor since a basin of attraction may be very small and the attractor dimension itself may be much less than the dimension of the considered system. Therefore, for the numerical localization of hidden attractors in multi- dimensional space it is necessary to develop special analytical-numerical computational procedures, which allow one to choose initial data in the attraction domain of hidden oscillation (which does not contain neighborhoods of equilibria) and then to perform trajectory computation. There are corresponding effective methods based on homotopy and numerical continuation: a sequence of similar systems is constructed, such that for the first (starting) system the initial data for numerical computation of oscillating solution (starting oscillation) can be obtained analytically, and then the transformation of this starting oscillation in the transition from one system to another is followed numerically.

In pre-Islamic times, the Abd al-Qays frequently raided Iran. øABD-AL-QAYS Encyclopaedia Iranica. When he became of age, Shapur II made it his first order of business to punish the Abd al-Qays. He led an army across the Persian Gulf and devastated large parts of Eastern Arabia and Syria, slaughtering most of the Abd al-Qays on the way. Later in his reign, Shapur moved many Abd al-Qays people to Kerman Province in Iran. During the Arab conquest of Iran, the Abd al-Qays migrated to Iran in large numbers and carried out extensive raids in southern Iran. Sizable groups of them settled down in Tavvaz near Dalaki in Bushehr Province. In the early 8th century, 4,000 Abd al-Qays warriors accompanied Qotayba on his campaign into Khorasan in Iran.

A spinner is an aircraft component, a streamlined fairing fitted over a propeller hub or at the centre of a turbofan engine. Spinners both make the aircraft overall more streamlined, reducing aerodynamic drag and also smooth the airflow so that it enters the air intakes more efficiently. Spinners also fulfill an aesthetic role on some aircraft designs.Crane, Dale: Dictionary of Aeronautical Terms, third edition, page 480. Aviation Supplies & Academics, 1997. Bingelis, Tony: Bingelis on Engines, pages 196-210. Experimental Aircraft Association Aviation Foundation, 1995. Bingelis, Tony: Firewall Forward, pages 269-273. Experimental Aircraft Association Aviation Foundation, 1992. Piston engine spinners Piston-powered aircraft often have spinners of one of two basic designs. The large spinner fits over the propeller, while the smaller skull cap style is directly attached to the propeller and just covers the propeller mounting bolts. The spinner may be constructed from aluminium or fibreglass. Often softer grades of aluminium are used to reduce the tendency to crack in service. Early fibreglass spinners introduced as kits for the homebuilt aircraft market in the early 1990s initially developed a poor reputation for cracking. More recent models have resolved these problems and they now function as well as aluminium ones do. The normal method of installation of a large spinner on a light aircraft involves installing a circular spinner back plate over the engine driveshaft, then the propeller, followed by a spinner front plate. The spinner dome is then mounted over this assembly and secured with screws to the back and front plates. Small plates are usually fitted behind the propeller to fill in the spinner dome cutouts and are secured to the backplate again with screws. Some spinner designs do not incorporate the front plate, although these are not suitable for higher-powered engines. The loss of a spinner in flight has caused damage to aircraft as well as accidents. If the spinner becomes partially detached then damage to the engine cowling can result, along with a high degree of vibration that results in the need for an immediate engine shut-down and a forced landing. In cases where the spinner has completely departed the aircraft it often impacts the airframe or the windshield, with potentially catastrophic results. Because of their role as a rotating component and the risk of cracking and failure due to engine vibration, spinners require regular inspection, particularly of the back plate as well as the spinner dome itself. History The first spinners were fitted to aircraft in the early 1910s. originally to reduce drag caused by the large- diameter rotary engines of that era, and also were prominent on World War I-era aircraft, like the Morane-Saulnier N French monoplane fighter, and for the Central Powers, Robert Thelen's Albatros D.I through D.V series of fighter designs. In some cases spinners were found to block airflow to the engine, causing overheating,Western Carolina Air Museum: 1915 Moraine-Saulnier N a problem later solved by careful aerodynamic design.Century of Flight: Bloch MB 174 References External links *Development of airscrew spinners - Flight, November 1940 Category:Propellers Category:Jet engines ","title":"Spinner (aeronautics)"},{"id":"33195094","text":"The ≈†avrin Hills subdialect (≈°avrinski govor,Smole, Vera. 1998. \\"Slovenska nareƒçja.\\" Enciklopedija Slovenije vol. 12, pp. 1‚Äì5.

It is listed as a Monument historique.  Characteristics  River Isle, from the terrace The Ch√¢teau de Mauriac is in the department of the Dordogne, to the north-west of the town of Douzillac. It overlooks the railway line from Coutras to Tulle and the River Isle, below the Mauriac dam. The dam used to drive a mill providing energy to a furniture factory, now replaced by a small hydroelectric power plant. It is private property, but the gardens and terrace are open to visitors. The ch√¢teau is located on the eastern border of a park, bounded by two towers at the south-west and north-west. Access to the castle is via a partly-ruined gatehouse. The chateau's appearance from the south-east is that of a lodge flanked by two wide round towers, all with machicolation.  History  The ch√¢teau itself was built in the 15th and 16th centuries. It replaced a mediaeval structure, which itself replaced one from the Gallo-Roman period. On his return from Italy, Michel de Montaigne made a stop at the ch√¢teau in 1581. The ch√¢teau was given the title of a monument historique on 12 October 1948, and the entire site on 10 February 2016.

According to Rabbis for Human Rights states that 43 such hate crime attacks have been made against churches, mosques and monasteries in Israel, the West Bank and East Jerusalem since 2009. In May 2014, Shin Bet said the price-tag hate crimes were the handiwork of about 100 individuals mainly hailing from the Yitzhar settlement and hilltop outposts, and were inspired by the ideas of rabbi Yitzchak Ginsburgh.Amos Harel, Revital Hovel, Jack Khoury,'Security sources: 100 followers of racist rabbi are behind hate crimes,' Haaretz 8 May 2014. One objection to the use of the term is that it dehumanizes Palestinians. Ron Ben- Tovim argues that it is a supermarket label used as a euphemism for violent acts aimed to instill terror into the hearts of Palestinians, applied to acts against Palestinians by Jews, whereas it is standard in Israeli usage to brand all acts perpetrated by Palestinians against Israeli Jews as terrorism. \\"Cutting off the head of the terror snake\\" and \\"tentacles of terror\\" are commonly used metaphors. To use a special term, \\"price tag\\" for acts of violence against Palestinians is to reduce the terror to a message by settlers to their government, and ignore the victim.Ron Ben-Tovim 'Stop Calling Hate Crimes 'price Tag Attacks' It's Offensive,' Haaretz 5 August 2015.

The expression is occasionally used for acts that took place before this date, to denote a retributive act. Gideon Levy, for example, describes the settlement of Mitzpe Yair, established in 1998 after the murder of settler Yair Har-Sinai, as \\"an early 'price tag' operation ‚Äì an act of retribution for some incident.\\"Gideon Levi, 'Not sacred, not stolen,' at Haaretz, 7 September 2012 The term has been also used to describe Israeli retaliative policy against Palestinians, and on behalf of the settler enterprise, by describing PM Binjamin Netanyahu's decision to permit Jews to move into a contested property, Machpela House, in response to the shooting of an Israeli border policeman near the Tomb of the Patriarchs in Hebron.Haaretz editorial, 'A governmental price tag attack,' at Haaretz 24 September 2013.

Later that same year, Asher Weisgan of the Shiloh settlement killed four Palestinians in a similar terror attack perpetrated as a \\"protest\\" at the withdrawal from Amona.Byman, 2011 p.290-1 According to Harel, since the Gaza and Amona withdrawals > \\"the extreme right has sought to establish a 'balance of terror,' in which > every state action aimed at them ‚Äì from demolishing a caravan in an outpost > to restricting the movements of those suspected of harassing Palestinian > olive harvesters ‚Äì generates an immediate, violent reaction.\\"Amos Harel, > ANALYSIS: The extreme right has sought to establish a 'balance of terror', > in Haaretz, 3 November 2008. In July 2008, after the evacuation of a bus from the Israeli outpost of Adei Ad, followed by clashes between settler groups with Palestinians and the IDF, settler Itay Zar from the Israeli outpost of Havat Gilad alluded to the price- tag policy in stating: \\"Whenever an evacuation is carried out ‚Äì whether it is a bus, a trailer or a small outpost ‚Äì we will respond.\\" In an article published in May 2010, Zar stated that these actions represent a legitimate struggle which includes mainly the blocking of intersections and roads in order to disrupt the regular operations of Israeli security forces, preventing them from demolishing settler houses. Zar referred to the criminal activity involved in these actions as \\"marginal and uncontrolled acts.\\" In the wake of the dismantlement of Noam Federman's farm outside Hebron in October 2008, opponents of the evacuation called for revenge attacks against the security forces, telling soldiers \\"you should all be defeated by your enemies, you should all become Gilad Shalit, you should all be killed, you should all be slaughtered, because that's what you deserve\\", and \\"set a price tag\\" on the event by stoning soldiers and local Palestinians, wounding two Israel Border Police officers, vandalizing cars, and destroying graves in a Muslim graveyard.Haaretz Editorial, 'Defeat settler terror', Haaretz, 27 October 2008. Price tag operations were originally envisaged as mobilizing actions by settlers throughout the West Bank ‚Äì retaliating in the north when outposts in the south were threatened with dismantlement, and \\"exacting a price\\" in the south when outposts risked removal in the north. However, by 2009, though considerable damage was wrought to Palestinian property and persons, a coordinated north-south campaign still hadn't been realised. Price tag attacks could, furthermore, also be triggered purely on the basis of an announcement of government measures or by rumours of an imminent evacuation.OCHA, 1 November 2009. Settlers have used the term to describe Israeli government operations that demolish the illegal structures they have built.Yoav Zitun and Itay Blumenthal, 'Six Border Policemen hurt, IDF post destroyed in settlers' rampage near Yitzhar,' Ynet 8 April 2014:'The Border Policemen had begun to demolish illegal structures at the settlement when local residents began throwing stones at the troops. Two police officers required medical attention. Settlers at Yitzhar slammed the demolition as a \\"price tag\\" attack carried out by the military in revenge for attacks on Israeli security personnel in recent days.' The acts of random violence generally follow actions by Israeli authorities that are perceived as harming the settlement enterprise, or follow Palestinian violence against settlers. \\"Price tag\\" acts include demonstrations, blocking of roads,Price Tag blocking intersections throughout the West Bank and Israel clashes with Israeli security forces and even attacks against Israeli security forces personnel. Usually, however, the term refers to actions carried out by radical right-wing Israeli activists against Palestinians and their property. These include throwing stones at Palestinian cars, the torching of Palestinian fields and orchards, as well as the destruction and uprooting of trees belonging to Palestinians. According to Israeli human rights group, Yesh Din, \\"The goal is to create a price for each evacuation, causing the Israeli authorities to think twice about carrying them out.\\" A September 2011 article in The Economist suggested that one motive for these attacks might be to instigate violent Palestinian reaction, because the settlers are better-armed and believe that they could defeat the Palestinians. Towards the end of 2009, following an Israeli government decision to freeze any Israeli construction in the West Bank for a period of 10 months, several suspicious attacks were carried out in the West Bank, including the arson of a mosque in the Palestinian town of Yasuf, during which graffiti was sprayed on a building saying \\"Prepare for the price tag\\". The Shin Bet estimates of the extent of the perpetrator group vary: one figure calculates that from several hundred to about 3,000 people implement the price tag policy, while a recent analysis sets the figure at a few dozen individuals backed a few hundred right-wing activists. The vast majority of the settlers reject such actions, Shin Bet officials say. The perpetrators are organized in small close-knit and well-organised cells. A 2009 summary report published by the Israel Police stated that during 2009 there was a decline in these types of attacks. According to a report of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) published in November 2009, if Israel were to begin evacuating settlements in the West Bank, 248,700 Palestinians living in 83 communities would be exposed to this policy, of which 22 communities with 75,900 inhabitants would be at high risk. According to Yesh Din, which monitored a selection of incidents over 4 years, Israel Police did not file a single indictment following 69 cases that included price tag operations, where thousands of olive trees were burnt down between 2005 and 2009.Human Rights Watch Separate and Unequal Israel‚Äôs Discriminatory Treatment of Palestinians in the Occupied Palestinian Territories,' Human Rights Watch, December 2010 p.99.OCHA, 1 November 2009:\\"The lack of adequate law enforcement and accountability in regard to settler violence has been recurrently pointed out, since the early 1980s, by official commissions appointed by the Israeli authorities, as well as by human rights organizations..\\" According to Reuters, there was a 57% upswing in such attacks in the first seven months of 2011. No charges had yet been brought against suspects in price tag incidents. In September 2011 the Shin Beit advised the government to withhold funding from one yeshiva, Od Yosef Chai in the settlement of Yitzhar, on the basis of intelligence reports that its rabbis encourage students to attack Arabs, including 'price tag' assaults. Price tag attacks have been made on Christian holy sites. In response to one on the Dormition Abbey on Mount Zion early in October 2012, Rabbi Gilad Kariv commented:\\"This price tag epidemic threatens to become a routine part of Israeli public life, causing moral, social and international damage. Law enforcement, which has failed to deal with the phenomenon, must make this a much higher priority than it has until now.\\" Oz Rosenberg and Nir Hasson, 'Another Israeli church defaced with 'price tag' graffiti,' at Haaretz, 3 October 2012. In December 2012, two yarmulke-clad youths, one a candidate for the Shin Bet security service, handed out flyers, promoting price-tag attacks against Palestinians, at an IDF induction centre in Tel Hashomer. The IDF issued a statement condemning political propaganda within the army, the centre was notified and the distribution of flyers stopped.Gili Cohen 'Activists hand out fliers promoting 'price tag' attacks at IDF center,' at Haaretz, 3 December 2012. Daniel Byman and Natan Sachs, writing for the Council on Foreign Relations's in-house journal Foreign Affairs, state that arson and the destruction of trees do not belong in the same category and aren't morally equivalent to suicide bombing though they, as well as Israeli politicians such as Moshe Ya'alon, define these acts of vandalism as a form of terrorism. In June 2013, according to Zehava Gal-On, the Israeli Cabinet was pressured, despite a recommendation by the Attorney- General to the contrary, to define perpetrators of such attacks as members of \\"forbidden organizations\\" as opposed to \\"terror groups\\". The implications are significant, in that belonging to the latter carries prison sentences of up to 20 years, whereas \\"forbidden organizations\\" only risk confiscation of their property, and under the definition, arrested members of price tag activist groups can avoid criminal prosecution. = Allegations of staged price tag attacks = Settlers have at times claimed that Palestinians cut down trees on their own land and blame settlers.Joshua Reiner, Settlers blame: Palestinians faked price-tag ,‚Äô Walla!

In 2011 two boys from the Arab village of Beit Zarzir admitted that they had sprayed swastikas and \\"Death to Arabs\\" on the walls of their school.Amichai Rubin, (Hebrew) in Srugim (Knitted), 17 February 2011.A shepherd from the village of Majdal Bani Fadil near Ma'ale Efrayim blamed settlers for a fire that killed his flock. In May 2011 the Israel Police arrested several members of the Israeli-Arab Bakri family from Jaffa under the suspicion of plotting to kill an imam in the Hassan Bek Mosque in Jaffa, due to a business dispute. The murder was intended to appear as a \\"price tag\\" attack carried out by Israeli right-wing activists.Haaretz Service and Yaniv Kubovich,'Jaffa gang suspected of plotting to kill sheikh, blame rightists for crime,', in Haaretz, 17 May 2011. Israeli settlers were accused by an Arab farmer of having gathered his sheep into an area thick with brush and setting fire to the bushes, burning alive his 12 pregnant ewes. This claim was supported by the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem and reported by the Palestinian Ma'an News Agency and Israeli newspaper Haaretz. The police questioned the farmer's description of religious settlers wearing skullcaps driving a car on Sabbath as most Orthodox Jews do not drive on this day. Caroline Glick writing in The Jerusalem Post reported that the farmer later admitted that he lost control of a brush fire that was responsible for the damage. Israeli media network, Arutz Sheva, said this incident exposed the tactic of leftists of accepting Arab claims and falsely accusing Jews. Two 15-year-old Bedouin students of Beit Zarzir confessed, after being arrested in March 2012, their responsibility for damaging a school for Arab and Jewish students, and spraying on the wall of the school, \\"Death to Arabs\\", \\"price tag,\\" and\\" \\"Holocaust to the Arabs\\". In February 2013, Israel Police investigated an incident in the Qusra village, where six cars were vandalized. A Palestinian was later arrested. In January 2014, near Eli, a settler said he photographed Palestinians chopping down an olive tree. A later report on Ma'an News blamed 'settlers' for the incident. = Jewish settler stages fake Palestinian attack = In July 2013 an Israeli settler was arrested by police for staging a 'price tag' assault on his own car. While visiting his family at the Kiryat Moshe neighbourhood in Jerusalem, he phoned the police to complain that someone had slashed the tires of his car and sprayed it with Arabic graffiti reading 'slaughter the Jews' (itbah al-Yahud). Investigations led to an admission that he himself was responsible for the damage and the motivation for the act was to \\"raise awareness\\" about Arab price tag acts conducted against Jews.Noam (Dabul) Dvir ,'Settler sprays 'slaughter Jews' on own car,' at Ynet, 12 July 2013.  Police investigations  The Israeli government has set up a national task force, forming part of the elite Lahav police unit, to coordinate investigations and gather intelligence on these attacks. Allocated 80 positions, the price tag crimes unit has, after 18 months, filled them with 30 police officers, only for operations in the West Bank.Chaim Levinson, 'Israel Police creates unit to fight 'price tag' attacks - but only in West Bank,' at Haaretz 26 June 2013 After a number of mosques were torched over 2011, all suspects subsequently detailed were later released, since law enforcement officers encountered difficulties in securing evidence against them.Chaim Levinson, Jonathan Lis,police denies provocateurs operating among settlers,' at Haaretz, January 6, 2012. Dan Halutz, former Chief of Staff of the Israel Defense Forces, in June 2012, commented to Army Radio that the authorities were not doing enough to crack down on \\"price tag\\" vandalism, or what he called \\"counterterrorism\\". \\"If we wanted, we could catch them and when we want to, we will,\\" he added.Jodi Rudoren, Khaled Abu Aker, 'West Bank Mosque Is Set Ablaze and Vandalized,', at The New York Times, 19 June 2012 The opposition leader in the Knesset, Shelly Yachimovich, commented in mid-June, after another tire- slashing price tag attack on Palestinian vehicles that > \\"It is not logical that Israel, which is blessed with intelligence and > operational capabilities that are among the best in the world, cannot catch > an extremist group that causes indescribable damage.\\"Noam (Dabul) Dvir, hate > crime in J'lem: Car tires slashed in Arab neighborhood,' at Ynet,24 June > 2013. In response to such allegations, a Shin Bet officer has stated that finding culprits for price tag incidents is extremely difficult because the hilltop youth believed to be behind much of the vandalism are harder to penetrate and recruit as informers than has been the case with Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants.Ben Hartman, 'Hilltop youth the hardest informants to recruit' The Jerusalem Post, 9 May 2014. In January 2014, following an incident in which a groups of vandals from an illegal settlement near Esh Kodesh were captured by Palestinian villagers and handed over to the IDF, Uri Misgav wrote that \\"the strongest army in the Middle East along with the Shin Bet security service, with all its effectiveness, have not been able to rein in\\" the settler militia thought responsible for these assaults \\"over all these long years\\".Uri Misgav, 'The occupation is one big 'price tag‚Äô attack and we're all paying the price,' at Haaretz 10 January 2014. In February 2015 the Lod District Court convicted a West bank settler, Binyamin Richter, of a racially inspired hate attack, for what it deemed a 'price tag' attack in 2013. Richter was sentenced to 3 years imprisonment, and ordered him to compensate the proprietors of the damaged property to the tune of $3,900.Stuart Winer, torched near Bethlehem in apparent hate crime,' The Times of Israel 25 February 2015. In January 2016, Corporal Elad Sela, an Etzion Brigade soldier from the settlement of Bat Ayin, who had been arrested in March 2015, was sentenced to 3 years and 9 months imprisonment for passing on secret information to price tag activists concerning future IDF operations.  Legal redress  In 2006 the Supreme Court of Israel laid down a decision that the State was obliged to \\"devote manpower for the protection of Palestinian property, must open an immediate inquiry when reports of harassment are received, and send out patrols by security forces to locate such activities.\\" In one recent case, the Amour family sued for compensation after their olive grove near at-Tuwani, and the settlements of Ma'on and Havat Ma'on, was subject to a price tag assault. Unknown vandals had cut down 120 trees in 2006; a further tree was felled and the fencing destroyed in 2011; and on 9 May 2013 half of the trees were chopped down and a slogan left reading: \\"price tag is fed up with thieves ‚Äì mutual responsibility\\" and \\"regards from Eviatar\\". After initial requests for action from the Civil Administration were ignored, the family filed a claim for damages on the basis of negligence. The state replied to the petition by contending that most of the blame play with the plaintiff, since the Amour family had failed to take appropriate measures to prevent the incident. It further said that the vandals' acts were not sanctioned by the state of Israel. The IDF is investigating the matter.Amira Hass, ‚ÄòIsrael says Palestinian price tag victims to blame for attacks,‚Äô at Haaretz 36 December 2013  Israeli reactions  = Official Israeli reactions = Israeli President Shimon Peres: \\"It is unconscionable that a Jew would harm something that is holy to another religion ...

Former Knesset member and settler leader Hanan Porat has also condemned the price tag policy. \\"The 'price tag' response is immoral,\\" Porat said. \\"It's unheard of that one needs to burn the vineyards and fields of Arabs. It's immoral ... and it gives legitimacy to those who are interested in undermining the outpost issue. It's a very grave matter.\\" The Chief Ashkenazi Rabbi of Israel, Yona Metzger, visited a mosque in Yasuf 2009 to express his revulsion at the idea of price tag attacks and to deliver a Quran to the local imam. He was escorted by Israeli security forces and Palestinian police, and although the imam had welcomed him, he and his escorts were pelted by rocks upon leaving the village. The burning of a mosque at the Bedouin town Tuba-Zangariyye on 3 October 2011 shocked Israelis, as many Bedouins, including those from this village, serve in the Israeli army. The Israeli President Shimon Peres, accompanied by Israel's two chief rabbis, visited the mosque, and after surveying the damage stated he was \\"full of shame\\". Peres also stated that the mosque burning is \\"an un-Jewish act.\\" In denouncing the attack he added: \\"It is unconscionable that a Jew would harm something that is holy to another religion ...

During the visit, the chief Sephardic rabbi of Israel, Shlomo Amar, and chief Ashkenazi Rabbi Yona Metzger, jointly condemned the act and conveyed a message of reconciliation to the village residents. Amar said that he saw it as his duty to set a personal example for the respect one must show to places holy to different religions. He stresses that in the absence of proof, the act may have not been committed by Jews, and the attempt to ascribe the act to price tag activists may be in fact a blood libel. He also added that if the arsonist was in fact Jewish ‚Äì he was subject to some of the Jewish laws of Dinei Rodef., in Kobi Nahshoni, 'Rabbi Amar: Mosque arson may be blood libel,' in Ynet, 4 October 2011:'the attempt to ascribe the act to \\"price tag\\" activists is basically a \\"blood libel\\".

She stated that the only \\"price tag\\" action acceptable to her is the establishment of a new outpost in response to every outpost that had been demolished by Israeli authorities. According to a Ynet-Gesher survey conducted in March 2011, it was found that 46% of Israelis believe that \\"price tag\\" attacks are justified to a certain extent. A breakdown of attitudes among religious nationalist and ultra- orthodox respondents revealed that a large majority are supportive of such price-tag attacks, with 70% of Orthodox and 71% religious nationalists Jews surveyed justifying the policy.Ynet, Poll: 46% in favor of 'price tag',' in Ynet 28 March 2011. Ori Nir of Peace Now evaluated the poll as indicating significant support for violent actions among the Israeli public, yet estimated that it is likely that the timing of the poll influenced the respondents' views. Israelis were still under the influence of the Fogel family massacre, when five Jewish family members, including young children, were massacred in their beds on Sabbath. A later survey, conducted in November 2011 by Tel Aviv University, found that 88% of Jewish Israelis said they were opposed to the \\"price tag\\" attacks, with 38% believing the government's response to the attacks to be \\"too mild\\" and another 38% finding the response appropriate. The remaining 13% called the state response \\"too harsh\\". In some cases, Israeli settlers have claimed that Palestinians and left-wing activists staged \\"price tag\\" attacks as a means of provocation, in an attempt to tarnish the image of Jewish settlers in the West Bank.Ali Waked & Efrat Weiss, After fire in the mosque, a Border Policeman and Palestinian injured (Hebrew) in Ynet, 11 December 2009.Yair Altman, 'Settlers: Arabs, leftists staged 'price tag' act,', in Ynet, 30 October 2010.Samuel Grossman, ◊î◊™◊§◊®◊¢◊ï◊ô◊ï◊™ ◊ë◊ô◊®◊ï◊©◊ú◊ô◊ù ◊ê◊ó◊®◊ô ◊ò◊¢◊†◊ï◊™ ◊ú\\"◊™◊í ◊û◊ó◊ô◊®\\", in Ynet, 20 March 2010.

According to the Israeli journalist Nadav Shragai, there is no Israeli leader or rabbi who openly supports this policy, yet some of the young activists who carry out these acts are students of the rabbis Yitzchak Ginsburgh, David Dudkavich and Yitzhak Shapira, who head the \\"Od Yosef Chai\\" Yeshiva in the Israeli settlement of Yitzhar.The Settler's new policy  Haaretz  Oct 3rd 2008 In an interview on Galei Tzahal in February 2010, Ginsburgh explicitly called to refrain from violence against Palestinians. Shapira, while urging a \\"fierce defense\\" of outposts, holds the IDF responsible for the atmosphere in which such acts are undertaken, and for implementing a price tag policy against the yeshiva. Shapira, who has called for retaliatory attacks against Palestinians, was arrested in January 2010 for his alleged involvement in the torching of a Palestinian mosque. He denied any involvement, and was released due to lack of evidence.\\"Rabbi arrested, suspected in West Bank mosque arson\\", BBC News, 27 January 2010 After an arson attack on a West Bank mosque in 2010, six prominent rabbis from the nearby settlement of Gush Etzion visited the mosque to deliver new copies of the Koran that had been burned. In July 2011, police announced that they would question prominent rabbis Dov Lior and Ya'akov Yosef over whether their endorsements of Yitzhak Shapira and Yosef Elitzur's book, Torat Hamelech (The King's Torah) which argues that killing non-Jews is acceptable as part of a religious war, constituted an incitement. Security officials said that the book could be used by settlers to justify price tag retributive attacks on Palestinians.Sheera Frenkel Israel's probe of radical Jewish text puts rabbis in spot light, McClatchy Washington Bureau, 7 July 2011. According to ynet news, in 2011, the Israeli Education Ministry decided to shut down the Dorshei Yehudcha Yeshiva high school and withhold funds from the Od Yosef Chai yeshiva due to the involvement of students in violence against Palestinians and security forces. The two yeshivas based in Yitzhar were headed by Rabbi Yitzchak Ginsburgh. Education Ministry Director-General Dr. Shimshon Shoshani harshly criticized the establishments writing that \\"The students are involved in many violent acts against Palestinian residents and security forces, including during yeshiva study hours. Prominent rabbis in the yeshiva support and/or are involved in this violent activity and go as far as to incite the students to this sort of activity.\\" Knesset member Michael Ben-Ari (National Union) said that the shut down of the yeshiva constituted \\"capitulation to leftist terror.\\" The rabbi of Har Brakha, Eliezer Melamed, who according to Chaim Levinson of Haaretz, is considered one of the more extreme settler rabbis, used his weekly column in the newspaper Basheva to denounce the price tag policy. He wrote, \\"We don't aspire to private vengeance, but to state vengeance led by the Israel Defense Forces and all the systems of government\\". According to rabbi Barry Leff of the Israeli NGO Rabbis for Human Rights, the price tag policy is forbidden by halacha (Jewish religious law). Citing the Book of Deuteronomy 24:16, he writes that the Torah clearly forbids vicarious punishment, punishing someone other than the offender. Furthermore, according to Leff, when the perpetrators attack a mosque, a house of God, they are also guilty of violating the principle of bal tashchit, not to carry out wanton destruction, as well as the sin of Chillul Hashem, the desecration of God's name. Reactions =Palestinian= A Palestinian Authority spokesman, Ghassan Khatib, has stated that Israeli settler attacks on Palestinian agricultural land are \\"not random events\\", and that they are \\"condoned and supported by the Israeli government\\" who provide settlers with \\"full impunity and army protection while they destroy Palestinian land\\". An Abu Ghosh resident, Jawdat Ibrahim, writing an op-ed for Ynet in response to the slashing of the tires of 22 cars in his own town in June 2013, wrote that it was bizarre that the state of Israel managed to catch the enemies of the State in operations abroad, yet could not arrest the \\"bunch of local punks\\" who terrorize Arabs with their vandalism. Such acts are, in his view, the \\"direct result\\" of racist remarks by Israeli politicians, humiliation of Arabs by the police and officials in government offices, and the general atmosphere these attitudes create.

Built between 1514 and 1535, the Renaissance style castle like that of the Loire castles was classified as a historical monument in 20 March 1912 and the grounds, woods, and outskirts were registered in 19 May 1945. It is owned by the state of France. It is open to the public. History The construction of the castle of Puyguilhem began in 1514, sponsored by Mondot de La Marthonie, first president of the Parliament of Paris. A close friend of Francis I of France and lawyer to the king's mother Louise of Savoy, he administered the kingdom when the king went to war. The modest castle was built as a secondary residence and hunting lodge for La Marthonie and its layout is fitting for a nobleman of the time. Formerly protected by defensive works, it now consists of a main house flanked by two towers and a turret of stairs. The first of two stages of construction was completed in 1524, which included the foundations, part of the corner tower and the hexagonal turret. The second stage was completed in 1535. Its design oscillates between two epochs, medieval and renaissance. Several elements recall the Gothic style of the Middle Ages, while the additions made in the second phase of construction are like the Loire castles. The park contains a dovecote. The castle fell into ruin and in 1939 the state of France took ownership and restored the building. Since February 2008, it has been managed by the Centre des monuments nationaux (Center of National Monuments).

WeRebuild is a collaborative project used to propose and discuss laws as well as to collect information about politics and politicians. The Telecomix is the operative body that executes schemes and proposals presented by the WeRebuild.Werebuild and Telecomix CV‚ÄúChaos et productivit√© : l‚Äôentreprise 2.0 chez les cyberactivistes‚Äù on ReadWriteWeb France On September 15, 2011, Telecomix diverted all connections to the Syrian web, and redirected internauts to a page with instructions to bypass censorship.‚Äú#OpSyria: When the Internet does not let Citizens down‚Äù on Reflets.info Moreover, \\"Telecomix circulated the ways of using landlines to circumvent state blockages of broadband networks\\" during the Egyptian Revolution of 2011. Their most recent intervention was a large release of Blue Coat surveillance log files, allegedly revealing vast interception in Syria, which was analyzed and made public from the \\"telecommunist cluster\\" of Telecomix. The leak had previously been criticized for possibly revealing too much sensitive information about Syrian users by security researcher and hacker Jacob Appelbaum.  History  One of the first Telecomix servers, building their cryptographic infrastructure. This SPARC machine ran Debian Lenny, before it was retired. The organization was created at April 18, 2009, as a suggestion following a seminar about surveillance, the legislative changes regulating the National Defence Radio Establishment (FRA), and other laws processed in the European Parliament at the time. The audience was asked to help stop the surveillance laws that were about to be passed in the European Parliament. The evening after the seminar a spontaneous bifurcation started and someone threw a cipher. It was then Telecomix was born. During the first months of Telecomix' existence, focus was mostly on the Telecoms Package, the Data Retention Directive and the laws regulating the FRA. Work consisted of gathering information about the laws and the political processes involved, public conversations with legislators and art projects. As the organization grew larger, the definition and boundaries of the cluster became more undefined. According to one interview, an activist described it as \\"an ever growing bunch of friends that do things together\\" consisting of \\"[...] roughly 20 extremely active members, 50 active and some 300 total including lurkers\\". = Origins = Telecomix has their roots in a heterogenous activist and hacker scene. Many of the founding members had followed and participated in and around Piratbyr√•n and The Pirate Bay. There is membership overlap with The Julia Group and La Quadrature du Net, as well as with the hackerspaces Forskningsavdelningen in Malm√∂, Gothenburg Hackerspace and Sparvn√§stet in Stockholm. As Telecomix has a very vague concept of being a \\"member\\" of the group (the only formal ritual is to enter their IRC chat), it is however difficult to assess with certainty what their origins are. According to Marcin de Kaminski, who gave one of the earliest interviews on Telecomix's first project (which used to be under the domain telekompaketet.se, now with a new unrelated site owner), he points to a heritage line from Piratbyr√•n via a sudden side-project called Tapirbyr√•n (\\"The Bureau of Tapirs\\", which is an anagram of the word Pirate in Swedish), which then led to the formation of Telecomix. Apart from this statement by de Kaminski, there are no known written records of this story, and no member of Tapirbyr√•n has yet confirmed nor denied it. As Telecomix was founded, the initial work consisted of engaging parliamentary politics, to serve as an interface between concerned communities and politicians. As the work gradually moved over to direct interventions and rescue operations, the cluster moved over to a gradually more militaristic rhetoric, with heavy influences from 1990s-style crypto- anarchism.Werebuild and Telecomix CV However, during 2011 some Telecomix activists have given interviews and talks at various technology-related conferences under their real names.Decentralized Clustering. Talk given by Stephan Urbach on Chaos Communication Camp, 2011 Talk given at Hacknight in 2010‚ÄúMoving away from The Cloud, Earth Computing‚Äù. Talk by Jonathan Walck on Futur en Seine, 2011 This is in stark contrast to the earlier practice of eschewing real and individual names in favour of using Telecomix as a collective pseudonym. Rasmus Fleischer argues that the formation of Telecomix signified the end of a long era of pirate rhetoric, and instead shifted attention to a hacktivist approach to politics. Moreover, Christopher Kullenberg describes how \\"Telecomix News Agency\\" was shaped as a consequence of close online and offline friendships in connection with the trial against The Pirate Bay in his manifesto Det N√§tpolitiska Manifestet. In the book Svenska Hackare (\\"Swedish Hackers\\"), the two technology journalists, Daniel Goldberg and Linus Larsson, describe how WeRebuild (a project name used by Telecomix) appeared on a seminar on net neutrality held by the Swedish Government in 2009, to influence the implementation of the Telecoms Package.  Projects and operations  = Streisand = A project created and hosted by Telecomix is the Streisand project, named after the Streisand effect. The aim is to mirror certain types of content that gets blocked or censored.Streisand, retrieved on 2013-05-05 = WeRebuild = WeRebuild is a decentralized wiki page containing Telecomix information and projects. = Egypt Operations = During the internet blackout in early 2011, Telecomix released a video stating that they would launch series of attempts at restoring internet connectivity by means of old modems, faxes and rerouting of traffic. = Syria Operations = Similar in approach to the Egypt operations, the organization is currently intervening in Syrian networks. The most notable event was when Telecomix released log files from Blue Coat Systems surveillance equipment. Blue Coat Systems were eventually forced to admit that their devices were used in Syria, although they had not been directly sold to the country. = search.telecomix.org = Telecomix hosted a search service based on Seeks, an open-source P2P distributed search engine with an emphasis on user privacy. Seeks implements a decentralized peer-to-peer architecture: install Seeks on your machine, server or laptop, and automatically start sharing results. While users share queries over the Peer-to-Peer network, Seeks protects your privacy by sending encrypted query fragments to peers. This scheme makes it difficult for other peers to devise your initial query. = Blackthrow = Telecomix members often experiment with unorthodox encryption technologies. One such project is the \\"Blackthrow\\" concept computer (sharing some etymology with the word Black fax), described as: Due to the questionable legality of Blackthrow computers, Telecomix maintains no records of such devices being live and running. = Logo = The logo contains a variety of symbols. The origins remain unclear, but one common interpretation is that the pyramid in the middle is a symbol of kopimi philosophy, a project originally started by Piratbyr√•n. Moreover, the lightning arrows seem to originate from the logo of Televerket (Sweden), the old telecoms monopoly of Sweden. The star (also present on Televerket symbol) is a symbol of telecommunism, and the Omega sign is a symbol of resistance, as in Ohm's law. This interpretation of the symbols is sometimes referred to as the Gothenburg interpretation, as many of the founding members are from this town.\\"Cyber- activistes vs. dictateurs\\" on Nuovo.ch. By G√©raldine Jacot Others have, however, associated the symbols in the logotype with secret societies, due to several of them being associated with the Illuminati and freemasonry. In an article in French Magazine Lesinrocks,Anonymous, LulzSec: les √©nigmatiques banni√®res des hacktivistes Lesinrocks, 2011-11-17. Fabrice Epelboin argues that the pyramid in the Telecomix logo symbolizes power, and that \\"it is bordered by a bunch of elements - the Omega, the lightning, the star - the challenge ahead\\".

History The castle stands on a platform in a cliff. This platform was occupied in prehistoric times; Magdelanian and Azilian artifacts have been found. Then known as the Roc de Tayac, the early castle was built in the 13th century. During the course of the Hundred Years' War, it was held alternately by the English and the French, suffering successive sieges. It had to be rebuilt in the 16th century. In 1595, it suffered a siege during the Jacquerie des Croquants, an uprising of peasants against the king (1590‚Äì1600). In 1606, the king ordered the castle's demolition, undoubtedly following the execution of Jean Guy de Beynac who had been implicated in the Duke of Bouillon's conspiracy. Description The Ch√¢teau de Tayac houses part of the collections of the Mus√©e national de Pr√©histoire. The edifice is partly cut out of the rock and partly built. Its defensive walls rise on a corbelling of the cliff. The rooms, corridors and stairways are cut from the rock. Access is through a doorway beneath a semicircular arch of large stones.

In the early years of Daviess County priests would celebrate Mass in the homes of the settlers. The first church dedicated to St. Stephen in Owensboro was built in 1839 and the Rev. John C. Wathen was appointed the parish's first pastor. As the town and parish continued to grow a larger church was needed and so a second church was built on the same site as the first in 1856. The present church was built on Locust Street between 1924 and 1926. On December 9, 1937 Pope Pius XII established the Diocese of Owensboro. St. Stephen's was chosen as the new diocese's cathedral. The first Bishop of Owensboro, Francis Ridgley Cotton, was consecrated in St. Stephen's Cathedral on February 24, 1938. Catholic schools The first school in Daviess County was St. Francis Academy. It was opened by the Sisters of Charity of Nazareth in 1849. The same year that St. Stephen's became a cathedral, 1939, its first parish school opened on Frederica Streets with five grades. In 1951 Owensboro Catholic High School replaced St. Francis Academy. A new St. Stephen's school opened in 1962 on Locust Street. The parochial schools in Owensboro consolidated in 1989 and used the building at St. Angela Merici for the new school. That same year a preschool opened at St. Stephen's. On the 29th May 2017, the cathedral hosted the funeral of Nicky Hayden, the former MOTO GP and Owensboro native who died in Cesena, Italy, after a road accident in Rimini while he was training on a bicycle.

Geography The Neun√© rises within the commune of Gerb√©pal in the parc naturel r√©gional des Ballons des Vosges, which also contains a part of its length. It flows first to the north-west, then towards the west, and finally towards the south-west where it joins the right bank of the Vologne, at the level of the small settlement of Champ-le-Duc. The Neun√©'s principal tributary is the B'Heumey, which joins with it in the commune of Chapelle- Devant-Bruy√®res. Communes on the course of the Neun√© The Neun√© flows through the following communes, from upstream to downstream: Gerb√©pal, Corcieux, La Houssi√®re, Biffontaine, les Pouli√®res, la Chapelle-devant- Bruy√®res, Laveline-devant-Bruy√®res and Champ-le-Duc in the Vosges department.

Hydrology Le Neun√© is a substantial river.

The average interannual flow rate, or discharge of the river at Laveline-devant-Bruy√®res is . The Neun√© exhibits moderate seasonal fluctuations in flow rate. The high-water period occurs in the winter season, with average monthly instantaneous flow rates varying between from November to March inclusive, with an overall maximum in March and a secondary maximum in January. From April onwards, the flow rate drops off quickly and continues until the low-water period, which occurs from July to September, with minimum monthly average instantaneous flow rate going down to in August, still a comfortable flow for a small river. Fluctuations in flow rate can be more significant from year to year and over short time periods. At low water, the three-year low instantaneous flow rate can drop to in the case of a dry five- year period, or about , which is not too severe. As for floods, they can also substantial, considering the relatively small watershed. The Instananeous Maximum Flow Rate over 2 years (IMFR2) and the IMFR5 are respectively. The IMFR10 is and the IMFR20 is , while the IMFR50 has not been calculated due to an insufficient history of measurements. The volumes of the Neun√©'s floods rise to as much as 30 percent of those of the Vologne. The maximum instantaneous flow rate recorded at Laveline-devant-Bruy√®res during this period was on 30 December 2001, while the maximum daily average flow rate was on 4 October 2006. Comparing the first of these numbers with the different IMFR measurements of the river suggests that this flood was of the order of a 20-year event. The Neun√© is a substantial river. The runoff curve number in its watershed is annually, which is over twice the overall average of France with all basins taken together, and clearly greater than the average of the French basin of the Moselle, which is downstream of Metz).

Description and history The former Arbor Street Firehouse is located on the north side of Arbor Street, just west of Forest Avenue (United States Route 302), a major artery to downtown Portland, and south of a cluster of road and rail interchanges known as Deering Junction. The building is a 2-1/2 story brick structure, and is three bays wide with a stepped-back fourth bay on the right side. The first floor of the main bays are taken up by equipment bays with two-leaf swinging doors, while the recessed side bay has a pedestrian entrance, sheltered by a gabled porch. The second floor bays have sash windows, the central bay of the three with a pair of them. A wall dormer rises above the central bay, with a group of three smaller sash windows.Smith, Melanie (2010). NRHP nomination for Engine Company Number Nine Firehouse; available by request from the Maine Historic Preservation Commission The location where the firehouse stands was originally part of Westbrook, and was incorporated as part of the city of Deering in 1892. Deering was then a predominantly residential area, with many of its residents working in Portland. In 1899 it was annexed to Portland, greatly expanding that city's geography. After the annexation, the city's fire department embarked on a plan to update, modernize, and professionalize its force, equipment, and facilities. The Arbor Street station was built in 1902 as part of this process, functionally replacing a nearby wood-frame firehouse that had been built by the city of Deering. At the time of its construction, the equipment was still horse-drawn, and there would have been stables behind the main station. This station housed Engine Number 9 and Ladder Number 4 until 1972, when they moved to a new station on Forest Avenue.

It was constructed in Zmaj, a Zemun-based factory, in the Rogo≈æarski factory in Belgrade, and Albatros in Sremska Mitrovica. Fizir FN had an exceptional low-speed stability, a desirable trait for a training aircraft, and was reliable and easy to maintain. It was also widely used as a sport aircraft. Design and development The first prototype of Fizir FN (Fizir trainer) aircraft was designed and manufactured in Rudolf Fizir Workshop in Petrovaradin in 1929. Rudolf Fizir's workshop did not have the capacity for industrial production of aircraft, their area of work was design and prototyping. Although being small, this workshop played a significant role in the development of Yugoslav aeronautics after it emerged and was used for the training of engineers who later became important and famous in our aeronautical engineering.–°. –ú–∏–∫–∏—õ; –ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—ò–∞ —ò—É–≥–æ—Å–ª–æ–≤–µ–Ω—Å–∫–æ–≥ –≤–∞–∑–¥—É—Ö–æ–ø–ª–æ–≤—Å—Ç–≤–∞, –®—Ç. –î. –ì—Ä–µ–≥–æ—Ä–∏—õ, –ë–µ–æ–≥—Ä–∞–¥,1933. Many successful airplane prototypes from this workshop were later produced in Yugoslav airplane factories. Fizir FN was a single-engine two-seat biplane trainer with a pair of struts on each side. The wings were rounded at the tips and the flaps were located on both the lower and upper wings. The landing gear was fixed to the hinge axis. For amortization either coil springs and rubber (old type) or the rings of sand (later types) were used. The wooden structure of the fuselage and the wings were covered with a canvas. While the aircraft was in production, it underwent several refinements, aircraft was continually being refined, so that there are several sub-types of these aircraft, depending on engines installed. Operational history The first three aircraft was produced by the Zmaj aircraft factory for the Aero Club. Given excellent flight characteristics, the Air Force Command decided to use it to replace all training aircraft that had been in use for basic training previously. At that time basic pilot training schools used the Ikarus SB-1 (Mali Brandenburg) with a Mercedes engine, Zmaj built Hanriot H-320 with Salmson engines manufactured in 1928. In the beginning of 1931, Zmaj produced and delivered first 20 serial Fizir FN aircraft with the Walter NZ 120 radial engine and 10 with the Mercedes D.II inline engine. By 1939, Zmaj produced 137 aircraft, Rogo≈æarski fabricated 40 aircraft and in the 1940 the Sremska Mitrovica-based Albatros factory produced additional 20 aircraft of this type. Before the war, the Navy Aviation ordered four hydro Fizir FN (Floatplane) with floats and with a more powerful Walter Mars I engine. The production of last 10 Fizir FN aircraft started in 1943 in Zmaj for the Croatian Air Force, but were not finished until the liberation, when they were handed over to the Aeronautical Federation of Yugoslavia. During World War II, Yugoslav- manufactured aircraft were used by Italy in Albania, and by IS Croatia. Aircraft Fizir FN was reliable, easy to fly and maintain, so this plane stayed operative for many years (almost till 1950), as basic pilot training aircraft, both in military and civilian aviation, including sports flying. There are two surviving Fizir FN aircraft. One (serial number 9009, registration YU-CAY) is kept in the Museum of Yugoslav aviation at Belgrade Nikola Tesla airport.http://www.muzejvazduhoplovstva.org.rs/eksponati.php?jez=sr&id;=3 The other, designated Fizir FNH, which is a Fizir FN converted to a floatplane (serial number 9002, registration YU-CGO), is kept in Technical Museum, Zagreb.

Denmark had an embassy in Moscow, and the Soviet Union had an embassy in Copenhagen. Diplomatic relations were described as \\"excellent\\". Denmark recognized de jure the Soviet Union on 18 June 1924. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc occasionally named Denmark as the \\"weak links in the chain.\\" Denmark never recognized the Soviet annexation of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. History Russian revolutionary leader Vladimir Lenin visited Denmark for the first time in 1907, for a party meeting of Russian socialists in exile. Denmark deemed the meeting illegal and gave Lenin 12 hours to leave Denmark. In 1910, Lenin visited Denmark again, for the Eighth International Socialist Congress. Lenin later commented on the Danish socialism and the Danish Prime Minister Thorvald Stauning; \\"Stauning was a quasi-socialist as well as one of the most stingy and mean-spirited class snobs he had ever met.\\" During the Winter War in Finland from 30 November 1939 to 13 March 1940, 1,010 Danes including Christian Frederik von Schalburg traveled to Finland to fight the Russians.Christensen, C.

On 9 May 1945, Soviet troops occupied the Danish island of Bornholm, to fight the German soldiers. On 5 April 1946, the Soviet soldiers left Bornholm. After the assault on the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarossa, Denmark joined the Anti-Comintern Pact, and the Communist Party was banned in Denmark. As a result, many communists were found among the first members of the Danish resistance movement.Edmund Osma≈Ñczyk: Encyclopedia of the United Nations and International Agreements, Taylor and Francis 2002, , page 104 On 7 July 1952, Denmark handed over the Danish-built tanker Apsheron to the Soviet Union. The decision faced protests in the United States. The government of the United States threatened to cut off aid to Denmark. On 26 July 1952, American President Harry S. Truman ordered the military, economic and financial aid to Denmark to be continued, despite the delivery of the Danish tanker to the Soviet Union. From 16 June to 21 June 1964, Nikita Khrushchev visited Denmark. During his trip to Denmark, Nikita Khrushchev commented Denmark; \\"I have simply no words to describe the pleasure I felt observing the state of agriculture in Denmark.\\" The announcement by the Soviets of the intention to launch an Earth satellite during the IGY. This photo was taken at the Legation of the Soviet Union in Copenhagen, Denmark, during the 6th International Astronautical Congress, August 1955, shortly after the Americans announced their intentions to launch a satellite. Premier of the Soviet Union Nikolai Bulganin's policy against Denmark was to influence Denmark to limit their policy and commitments in NATO. In March 1957, Nikolai Bulganin warned Denmark that if they used their bases against the Soviet Union it would be suicide for Denmark. Bulganin said \\"If war is opened against the U.S.S.R., the annihilating power of modern weapons is so great it would be tantamount to suicide for foreign countries the size of Denmark. [sic]\\" After the Martial law in Poland in 1981, Denmark economically sanctioned Poland and the Soviet Union. In March 1983, Denmark was the first country in the European Economic Community to drop the sanctions against the Soviet Union. The Folketing voted 78‚Äì68 against a bill which would have reimposed sanctions. On 1 October 1987, Gorbachev praised Denmark for not allowing foreign military bases and nuclear weapons on its soil.

A group of hospitality-industry professionals met out of concern for the families of those restaurant and dining room workers who had been killed in the attacks. Many of those who died had been entry-level workers whose families would struggle to pay rent and other basic expenses in the wake of the attacks. Windows of Hope Family Relief Fund was founded to provide short- and longer-term assistance to these families. With much support from colleagues throughout the industry, the fund was founded by a core group of restaurant professionals: Darlene Dwyer, a public relations consultant in the food industry; David Emil, an owner and operator of Windows on the World at the time; chef Michael Lomonaco, executive chef at Windows on the World at the time; chef Waldy Malouf, chef and co-owner of the New York restaurant, Beacon; and chef Tom Valenti, chef and owner of the restaurant Ouest.  Activities  Windows of Hope serves 120 families. Initial assistance included cash grants, then extended to insurance coverage, educational tuition assistance, and case management services to help families cope not only with the loss of their loved ones but with securing settlements from the Federal Victims Compensation Fund. Fundraising activities included soliciting donations and sponsoring a Dine Out event on October 11, 2001, during which participating restaurants in New York and elsewhere in the country donated 10% of sales that evening to Windows of Hope. Ultimately $23 million was raised for the fund. Windows of Hope Family Relief Fund board members realized they would need help administering funds and structuring their organization. The fund enlisted the assistance of Community Service Society to provide services the fund itself could not. According to a Binghamton University analysis of 9/11 non-profits, the fund's use of the Community Service Society is one reason why Windows of Hope has been a successful example of a 9/11 charity. \\"Their willingness to acknowledge what they did not know and to use Community Service Society allowed them to be responsive quickly\\", said David Campbell, associate professor of public administration at Binghamton University and author of the study, \\"Organic and Sustainable: The Emergence, Formalization and Performance of a September 11th Disaster Relief Organization\\". As David Campbell writes in The Chronicle of Philanthropy, \\"... the Windows of Hope Family Relief Fund provides a valuable example of the difference new organizations made in the relief effort and offers lessons for how new and established organizations can work together and make one another stronger.\\" In 2006, the fund's focus narrowed to assisting with tuition for family members, and the fund contracted with Scholarship America to manage tuition payments and reimbursements. The fund maintains an educational liaison to support families in their interactions with Scholarship America and with questions and concerns about educational matters. The fund expects to serve the Windows of Hope families in this capacity through 2022.  Mission statement  Windows of Hope Family Relief Fund was formed to provide aid, future scholarships and funds to the families of the victims of the World Trade Center tragedy who worked in the food, beverage and hospitality professions throughout the entire complex and who were lost on September 11.

The mission of Alzar School is to build leaders who will positively impact the world. For either a fall or spring semester 35-45 students from all across the world join Alzar School for a fully accredited semester of high school. It is built upon the \\"Six Foundations\\" of Academics, Leadership Training, Outdoor Adventure, Cultural Exchange, Service Learning, and Environmental Stewardship. The school is accredited by the Northwest Accreditation Commission which is an accreditation division of AdvancED. Semester School During a semester at Alzar School, students live at the 100-acre campus in Cascade, Idaho and spend six weeks living abroad in Chile. Students participate in significant outdoor expeditions, learning to whitewater kayak/raft, hike, backpack, and more. Additionally, students continue their traditional academic courses (Science, Math, History, English, Spanish, etc.). Idaho Campus Alzar School's 100-acre campus in Cascade, IdahoThe Alzar School campus is located on the North Fork of the Payette River, in Valley County, Idaho. The campus has over 1 mile of river frontage and is just downstream of Kelly's Whitewater Park. The campus is near the main road but still feels secluded and wild. There is a town nearby and medical assistance is readily available. Chile The international experience is a cornerstone to the Alzar School semester and a critical component of the leadership development program. Every semester, Alzar School spends approximately 6 weeks in Chile. Fall semesters end in Chile and Spring semesters begin in Chile. While in Chile, students continue their academic curriculum with faculty traveling with the group. Students will spend approximately three weeks in small Chilean towns, continuing their academic courses while getting to know the towns, people, and activities of the area. Courses leverage these unique locations to help students draw connections to the towns, country, and current issues. Chilean students are part of each semester, living, studying and exploring alongside students from the U.S. No prior study of Spanish is required, but it is the only language we offer, as we want all students to be prepared to immerse themselves into life in Chile. History Alzar School is a 501c3 nonprofit organization that was founded in 2004 by Kristin Bierle and Sean Bierle. From 2007-2011, the school offered 3-week expeditions to Idaho/California, Mexico, and Chile. These expeditions included service projects such as improving the playground at an orphanage in Chile, hauling school supplies into a remote rural school in Mexico, and working with the US Forest Service to do ecological projects in California and Idaho. The founding instructors of Alzar School have done many annual trips to foreign countries with young adult leaders. The students and instructors go through interview-like process to see if they are right for the excursion group. The bonds that have formed from working together have kept past members connected across city, state, and national lines. Other semester schools There are several semester schools, each with different themes, philosophies, and approaches to programming. Examples include: Conserve School, High Mountain Institute, and The Island School. Name Alzar is a Spanish verb which translates to ‚Äúto rise,‚Äù ‚Äúto elevate,‚Äù ‚Äúto lift,‚Äù or ‚Äúto boost.‚Äù It is used in many different expressions, such as alzar el vuelo (to take flight), alzar la carpa (to pitch a tent), alzar la vela (to set sail). As a verb, it indicates action, and Alzar School students are full of action. Camp Cup Challenge The Camp Cup Challenge is a whitewater paddling event involving several summer camps from North Carolina and other states. The Camp Cup Challenge is put on by the Alzar School and hosted by Nantahala Outdoor Center on the Nantahala River. The event is an opportunity for young paddlers to meet and develop friendships with like-minded youths, and gives kids a venue in which to build a community of active, engaged, and enthusiastic peers. Event highlights include a beginner-friendly slalom race on the Nantahala Bridge Gates as well as a downriver race through Nantahala Falls. Many students have joined the Alzar School because they attended the Camp Cup and learned about the semester program.http://www.noc.com/noccom/festivals-a-events/camp-cup-challenge/ References External links * Alzar School * Alzar School on Facebook * Alzar School on Twitter * Boise Weekly Article on Alzar School Category:Schools in Idaho Category:Semester schools Category:Environmental education in the United States Category:Outdoor education organizations ","title":"Alzar School"},{"id":"33195792","text":"Join the Bar is a 2011 novel written by Brajesh Rajak, a final year student of National Law School of India University, Bangalore.http://www.nls.ac.in/resources/studentsachivement/brajesh.htm It is a fictional account of the lives of 3 law students in a premier law institute in India.

He served as a bureaucrat in the tax offices of Nagasaki, Fukuoka and Kumamoto before he was hired by the zaibatsu, Suzuki Sh≈çten in 1908. In 1913, he transferred to Taish≈ç Life Insurance Company, and became its president. In addition, he was on the board of directors for the Nipponk≈ça Insurance Company. Kanemitsu was subsequently also president of ≈åji Electric Tram Company and Vice-Chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry. His political career began in 1920 General Election, when he was elected to a seat in the Lower House of the Diet of Japan under the Rikken Seiy≈´kai political party. He was subsequently re-elected a total of nine times from the same district. In 1937, he was Vice-Speaker of the House. In 1939, Kanemitsu was appointed as Minister of Colonial Affairs under the Abe administration. The same year, he formed his own political faction (together with Takeru Inukai), supporting Fumimaro Konoe's Shintaisei movement, and facilitated meetings with General Akira Mut≈ç of the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff to ensure military support for the movement. In September 1940, under the 2nd Konoe administration, Kanemitsu was appointed Minister of Welfare. He subsequently served as chairman of policy research and in other posts within the Taisei Yokusankai. Following the end of World War II, Kanemitsu joined the Nihon Shimpot≈ç political party, but was unable to run for office as he had been purged by the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers along with all other government officials and ranking members of the Taisei Yokusankai, so he had his son run in his place.

Description Papurana aurata is a relatively large species, with adult males measuring and adult females, based on the sole female paratype, in snout‚Äìvent length. The overall appearance is robust. The head is slightly wider than the body. The snout is gradually tapering and has a rounded tip. The canthus rostralis well defined and straight. The tympanum is about half size of the eye. The forelimbs are sturdy. The fingers are long and have small discs. The hind limbs are very long and strong. The toes are almost fully webbed and have discs that are larger than the finger discs. The species shows strong sexual dimorphism in colour, at least among individuals in mating condition. The male show an intensive yellow dorsal surface of the head, body and extremities, sometimes fading to pale yellow or yellow-brownish at night. The female dorsal colouration was brown, by day and night. Dorsal colouration is uniform expect for possibly a few dots. The iris is pale yellow in its upper part and reddish brown below. The male advertisement call consists of two notes, first a soft rattle and then a high-pitched trill. Sometimes either one of the notes is repeated, resulting in a three-note call.

It is endemic to Indonesia and occurs in southern Sumatra, Java, Bali, and a few smaller islands. Populations previously assigned to this species now belong to a number of other Chalcorana species, leading to the current delineation of Chalcorana chalconota with a much narrower range. This species is also known as the Schlegel's frog, brown stream frog, copper-cheeked frog, or, among with many other species, white-lipped frog. Description Chalcorana chalconota are relatively large frogs: adult males measure and females in snout‚Äìvent length. The legs are relatively short. The snout is slightly projecting. The tympanum is visible, slightly depressed. The finger tips are much enlarged. Coloration is green; the back may have black spots. Hind limbs may have crossbars. Dorsal skin is granular in females and has many fine spinules in males. Males also have conspicuously protruding humeral glands. Habitat and conservation Chalcorana chalconota can be found along small lowland forest streams, but also away from streams in forest and in highland areas at elevations up to above sea level. It occurs in both primary and degraded forests, and it can be found in human settlements, plantations, and rubbish- filled ponds. Breeding takes place in a range of aquatic habitats: quiet side pools of forest streams, temporary forest edge ponds, irrigation channels, and ditches in paddy fields. There are no major threats to this common species. It occurs in several protected areas.

Edison introduced some significant technological developments to the iron ore milling industry but the company ultimately proved to be unprofitable. Towards the end of the company's life, Edison realized the potential application of his technologies to the cement industry and formed the Edison Portland Cement Company in 1899. History =Beginnings= Photograph of Thomas Edison by Victor Daireaux, Paris, c. 1880s Edison had recognized the scarcity of iron ore in the 1870s,Woodside, Martin. Thomas A. Edison: The Man Who Lit Up the World. Sterling Publishing Company, Inc., 2007. pp. 73‚Äì74. particularly in the east of the United States. His developments in the field of electricity meant that he had sufficient finances to invest in other projects. Discovering that beach sand contained relatively high deposits of iron, he decided to form the Edison Ore-Milling Company in 1881.The Life of Thomas A. Edison. American Memory. Accessed September 24, 2011. He patented a method of extracting the metal using a large electromagnet after developing the process in an addition to his laboratory. The remaining deposits of iron in the eastern side of the United States were of poor quality, and the difficulty in separating it from the rock and other debris made it unprofitable. Edison believed that his method was a cheaper alternative, allowing him to keep costs down.Edison and Ore Refining. IEEE Global History Network. August 3, 2009. Accessed September 24, 2011. William Kennedy Dickson had been put in charge of much of the laboratory and further refined the techniques along with mining expert John Birkinbine. However, the market for Edison's iron was not sufficient to bring in a profit and the operation was closed down after just a few years. =Refocusing= After a short time away from the industry, Edison decided to return, adapting his methods to crush rocks brought up directly from a mine. He opened a plant in Bechtelsville, Pennsylvania near to existing iron mines as a trial before building one of the world's largest ore-crushing mills in Ogdensberg, New Jersey. Completed in 1889, the factory contained three giant electromagnets and was intended to process up to 1200 tons of iron ore every day. Technical difficulties repeatedly thwarted production. Edison formed the Edison General Electric Company in 1890 but it only lasted two years, merging in 1892 with the Thomson-Houston Electric Company to form the General Electric Company. He redirected his interest back to iron ore, having high hopes for what he could achieve: \\"I'm going to do something now so different and so much bigger than anything I've ever done before people will forget that my name ever was connected with anything electrical.\\" That year, he closed the Ogdensburg plant for upgrades, using the sale of stocks in General Electric to install new equipment that would be able to output even more iron ore. When it reopened, the earlier problems persisted and Edison once again had difficulties finding customers. =Sale and a change of industry= Eventually, Edison realized that the company was a failure, shutting it down in 1899. Edison commented about the financial losses, \\"it's all gone, but we had a hell of a good time spending it.\\" The manufacturing process produced a large quantity of waste sand, which the company sold on to cement manufacturers. The properties of the sand were particularly suitable for cement, leading to a harder, more durable product.Cement, The Edison Papers. March 31, 2010. Accessed September 24, 2011. Selling off the ore-crushing technology to mine owners, Edison decided to switch to the cement business, reusing some of the technology he had developed for ore-milling.

The specific name eschatia, derived from the Greek word for \\"outskirt\\", refers to distribution of this species being at the edge of the geographical range of the group. Description Chalcorana eschatia are moderate-sized frogs: adult males measure and females in snout‚Äìvent length. Body is slender and legs are long. The snout is obtusely pointed, but rounded in profile. The tympanum is distinct, slightly larger in males than in females. The outer fingers have large discs; no webbing is present but the middle fingers have sin folds. The toe tips have discs that are smaller than the fingers ones. The webbing between the toes is extensive. Dorsal skin is granular. Preserved specimens are dark brown dorsally and on the sides; no black spots are present. The venter is whitish or cream-colored, sometimes with round dark spots on the throat. Crossbars on the hind limbs are lacking.

It is commonly used by the visually impaired, allowing them to retain their mobility without relying on visual cues from their environment. Method Acoustic wayfinding involves using a variety of auditory cues to create a mental map of the surrounding environment. This can include a number of techniques: navigating by sounds from the natural environment, such as pedestrian crossing signals; echolocation, or creating sound waves (by tapping a cane or making clicking noises) to determine the location and size of surrounding objects; and memorizing the unique sounds in a given space to recognize it again later. For the visually impaired, these auditory cues become the primary substitute for visual information about the direction and distance of people and objects in their environment. Visually impaired person using a cane to navigate a city street However, there are a number of common obstacles to acoustic wayfinding techniques: noisy outdoor environments can challenge an individual's ability to identify useful sounds, while indoors, the architecture may not provide an acoustic response which is useful for orientation and destination. Among the most difficult environments to navigate for individuals who rely on acoustic wayfinding are crowded places like department stores, transit stations, and hotel lobbies, or open spaces like parking lots and parks, where distinct sound cues are lacking. This means that, in practice, individuals who navigate primarily by acoustic wayfinding must also rely on a number of other senses ‚Äì including touch, smell, and residual sight ‚Äì to supplement auditory cues. These different methods can be used in tandem. For example, visually impaired individuals often use a white cane, not only to physically locate obstacles in front of them, but also to acoustically get a sense of what those obstacles may be. By tapping the cane, they also create sound waves that help them to gauge the location and size of nearby objects. Importance in architecture Recently, architects and acousticians have begun to address the problems faced by people who rely primarily on acoustic wayfinding to navigate urban spaces. The primary work on the architectural implications of acoustic wayfinding comes from a collaboration between Christopher Downey, an architect who went blind in 2008 and has since worked to improve architectural design for the visually impaired, and Joshua Cushner, who leads the Acoustic consulting practice for engineering design firm Arup in San Francisco. Their work focuses on how to plan new facilities to include sensible systems of sound markers and architectural spaces which provide orientation through acoustic cues. On 20 September 2011, the San Francisco chapter of the American Institute of Architects organized an acoustic wayfinding discussion and walking tour, led by Chris Downey and Joshua Cushner. The purpose of the tour was to highlight the ways that visual impaired people associate sounds with particular buildings and locations, creating \\"sound markers\\" that help them find their way on the street or indoors, and to discuss implementing more unique sound markers into urban design projects.

A total of 38 sets were built by CSR Zhuzhou of China, in 6-car formations.  History  The Class 92 was procured under a Malaysian Government initiative, National Key Result Area (NKRA) to reduce congestion and improve public transport with a specific RM2 billion allocation to KTMB to improve commuter rail efficiency. A sum of RM 1.894 billion was spent to procure these trains, with the remainder being spent on the improvement of signaling along the Putra-Mid Valley stretch and a ticketing system upgrade. The first EMU was delivered on 23 September 2011 and was expected to operate in revenue service by late December 2011. However, delays in testing led to the subsequent postponement of launch. On 8 March 2012, 4 sets commenced operation. All 38 sets were in revenue service by July 2012.  Features  Designed for low dwell times and high passenger seating capacity, the trains have three double leaf doors per side. The driving motors have longitudinal seating only while the trailer feature a mixture of longitudinal and traverse 2+2 seating. It has wide gang-ways interconnecting each coach, allowing passengers to distribute effectively throughout the length of the train. However, two middle coaches of the class 92 is designated women's only coaches by its operator KTM, limiting full interactivity within the train set. Dynamic route maps located above doors details trains position relative to station in real-time. CCTVs and 3-pin power outlets are provided as further features. All trains have over-head air-conditioning systems to provide ventilation, dehumidification and comfortable temperature control. The KTM Class 92 trains are fitted with 65 million euros worth of Siemens made transformers, power converters, traction motors and vehicle control systems. Operation The Class 92 operates along the two Komuter lines in the Central Sector. During current 15-minute frequency operations, as many as 25 class 92 sets are used while the remaining sets are kept in reserve. In the future (10-minute frequency operations), it is expected for the total maximum of concurrently used sets to increase to 36 with 2 to remain in reserve. The Class 92 SCS uses Siemens instruments for control =Special service= During festivities, the KTM Class 92 is used for special services. Special services typically occur during occasions such as the \\"homecoming\\" exodus, saw class 92 sets operating intercity routes, such as the KL Sentral-Ipoh route complementing the ETS train service. In other festivities, such as the festival of Thaipusam, the class 92 also provides service from Ipoh direct to Batu Caves. =Maintenance and Depot= The Class 92 sets is maintained by its manufacturer CSR Zhuzhou. The maintenance facility will be based mainly at KTM‚Äôs Sentul Komuter Depot while a minor secondary base is located at Tanjung Malim. On top of all that, a new special commuter maintenance depot is being built (completion by Sept 2013) in the vicinity of Seremban station to house the class 92. The depot will have a capacity of stabling 19 six coach Class 92 sets and be able to conduct simultaneous maintenance work on up to 6 sets of commuter trains. The depot will also have up to 15 tracks of 6km each to store and maintain trains. The depot will also stage other Rawang-Seremban line rolling stocks. Design and Construction The Class 92 SCS is one of the first trains in Malaysia to introduce dynamic route passenger information systems. The exterior and interior of the class 92 is fully designed in Germany by Tricon Design for CSR Zhuzhou. The exterior has a Malaysian tiger inspired front motif and tiger fur side coating. The trains were assembled in CSR Zhuzhou's Electric Plant train factory in China. Whilepower traction units and vehicle control systems were built by Siemens in Germany.

Corruption Investigation The purchase of the KTM class 92 was notably under investigation by the Malaysian Anti Corruption Commission (MACC) over its tender process. In 2008, the Chinese railway manufacturer Zhuzhou Electric Locomotive Co Ltd, being the lowest bidder, was originally awarded the tender to build 3 car sets at the cost of RM 13.7 million. This figure later increased to RM 48 million per 6 car set. According to the details revealed to the press about the investigation, the re-negotiation process was held directly with the manufacturer and there was certain irregularities in pricing. The investigation is still on-going.  Operational Issues  There has been a number of issues related to the Class 92. In a comment by KTMB's incumbent president, Elias Kadir has noted that the class 92 is \\"not up to standard\\". In other related incidents, in which Class 92 sets malfunctioned was due reportedly to poor maintenance and non-payment to suppliers. Poor fleet management has led to many KTM Class 92 sets to have gone without routine maintenance, thus leading to a void in manufacturer warranty. According to the Auditor-General‚Äôs Report, The sum of RM99.94 million paid by the Railway Assets Corporation (RAC) to CSR Zhuzhou Electric Locomotive Co Limited to service the six-car Electric Multiple Unit (EMU) cannot be reimbursed due to KTMB's failure in its part of sending the trains for necessary maintenance. Vandalism Immediately, following its launch a number of KTM Class 92 were intentionally damaged, at least 20 side windows are cracked or holed, due a number of stone throwing incidents. This has culminated in a number of media reports. Despite the incidents, KTMB has no intention of upgrading the SCS to shatterproof glass to counter these incident. During the 2018 Malaysian general election, trains plastered with campaign advertising from then ruling party Barisan National had their windows cracked again. Accidents and Incidents * On 15 February 2013 at 23:00, an out-of-service KTM Class 92 SCS 20 derailed near Shah Alam station while returning to Sentul depot for maintenance. No one was injured. The train was heavily damaged and was subsequently written off. * On 15 April 2018, at around 13:00, SCS23 had a minor derail near Kuala Lumpur station, heading to Port Klang. No one was injured. * On 23 August 2018, at approximately 6.09 am, Set SCS06 rammed into the stoppers at Port Klang Station as the driver was believed to have not secured the brakes. The train was about to start its return journey to KL Sentral station. There were no injuries reported but it caused delays on the Port Klang Line. * On 18 October 2018, at around 06:02, a Class 26 locomotive hauling 30 wagons had crashed onto Set SCS06 (the same trainset involved at Port Klang on August 23) when it was stationary at Tanjung Malim Station. 5 passengers were reported injured with the trainset heavily damaged. Launch Delays The premature decay in KTM class 8X circa 2006-2012, led to a public outcry for new commuter rolling stock. Hence, there was a need for a fast- tracked tender of new trains in order to meet the rising rail passenger demand. Originally the first set was expected to be launched in December 2011, it was later delayed to January and then February 2012. The eventual launch date for Class 92 took place on March 8, 2012. Reports place the delay as a result of further operational testing, and driver training.

In use since the early 20th century in many armies throughout the world, bicycles allow for silent movement and increased mobility on the battlefield. Additional advantages of military bicycles are that they allow individual soldiers to carry more supplies without being encumbered and are very inexpensive to manufacture and maintain when compared to horses and vehicles. The first bicycles were introduced into the armed forces of several nations in the late 19th century; by the time of the start of World War I, all combatants were using them. The German Army had 36 independent companies of bicycle infantry, a battalion of cyclists attached to every cavalry division, and an additional 10 reserve bicycle companies and 17 replacement crews. The Italian Army's Bersaglieri mountain troops were the first to use folding bikes. During World War II bicycles were introduced to paratroopers as a means to provide them with transportation following the landing. The U.S. also used as general light transport, and for messenger duties. Separate units of bicycle infantry existed in armies of many nations until the end of 20th century, it was not until 2003 that the Swiss Army reformed its last three Bicycle Infantry Regiments. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, there was a resurgence in the testing of all terrain and folding bikes, for use by infantry in battle and patrolling cities. Some innovations introduced in bicycles designed for military use found their way to civilian markets as well, such as coaster brakes and the cyclometer. In modern times bicycles and electric bicycles are still used by many armies around the world but there are no separate bicycle infantry units.

It is a double-chantered bagpipe, with no drone, and is inflated by blowing by mouth into a goatskin bag. The instrument is widespread in the Greek islands. The word is a reborrowing of zampogna, the word for the Italian double chantered pipes. Tsampouna is etymologically related to the Greek sumf≈çnia (), meaning \\"concord or unison of sound\\"œÉœÖŒºœÜœâŒΩŒØŒ±, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus (from œÉ·ø†ŒΩ- sun-, \\"with, together\\" + œÜœâŒΩŒÆ ph≈çn·∏ó, \\"sound\\") and applied later to a type of bagpipe. While many bagpipes throughout Europe have experienced renewed interest in the 20th century (often after long decline or extinction), in 2006 ethnomusicologist Wolf Dietrich noted: \\"Greece seems to be the only country in Europe which today has no bagpipe revival.\\" However, a partial revival in the use of the tsampouna is occurring among traditional musicians on the island of Ikaria.

New musicians, a new audience, new terms of listening, a new repertoire along with the old one, and, most important, new or ever-timely messages, form the framework within which an old instrument remains alive and even gains popularity. This new tradition goes side by side with the old one that is still carried on, and is inspired by it.

It flows into the Vologne as a left tributary at Kichompr√©.  Etymology  The name Jamagne came from Ja-magna meaning \\"already big\\" by analogy with its outlet from the lake.  Geography  The course of the Jamagne is largely canalized and rectilinear when it flows through the G√©rardmer area, following the construction of Route nationale 417 in 1950. The river suffered from serious domestic pollution until 1998. When the Cleurie river valley was blocked by W√ºrmian moraine in a double vallum thick, the waters of the Hohneck massif stopped flowing towards le Tholy and accumulated upstream of the deposit, forming the lac de G√©rardmer. With no outlet to the west, the waters left the lake in the opposite direction to their historic one, via the Jamagne, which flows into the Vologne downstream of the hamlet of Kichompr√©. The flow of the Jamagne was widely exploited during the 20th century for generating electricity as well as for powering sawmills which were set up on its banks. In contrast to other rivers of the Vosges, the Jamagne is unique in flowing from southwest to northeast. Tributaries The Jamagne's principal tributary is the Basse des Rupts, also known as the Forgotte. However the lac de G√©rardmer is fed by four main streams: * The Cheny stream (to the east) * The Ch√™ne stram (to the north) * The Ph√©ny stream (to the south) * The M√©relle stream (to the west) According to the Sandre website, the M√©relle stream is identified as the mother branch of the Jamagne upstream of the lac de G√©rardmer. Nonetheless, the path of the Ph√©ny stream accumulated with the lower part of the Jamagne amounts to a total length of . Hydrology It appears that the fluctuations in flow rate of the Jamagne have never been studied. The flow of the river has been regulated since the beginning of the 20th century by a system of valves located at the outlet of the lac de G√©rardmer.

Parts of the lake and its shore are situated within the Burigi Game Reserve. History Visited by Dr. Hans Meyer's East African expedition, its name on maps of the time was Urigi. The lake's discovery is attributed to Capt. John Hanning Speke, who name it Lueor-lo-Urigi (\\"White Lake of Urigi\\"). Geography The lake is long and wide. It has an elongated shape, the greatest distance between the two extremities being about . It is so narrow that from one side, the other can always clearly be seen. The lake's water is bright azure in color. Its area measures approximately . Fed by rivers from surrounding hills, the largest is Ruiza River. The lake is visible from Useni or Kavari. Papyrus swamps and groundwater forest areas occur around the lake. The surrounding hills are brown, with dark green bush scatterings. Its receding waters have left great extents of flat plain on the sides and around the bays running far inland into valleys. The lake is sunk about below the average level of the bare grassy hills around it. There is a narrow basin at the head of the lake. Its shore is broken by numerous inlets. The Yanghiro district, which is situated on the eastern shore of the Urigi, is a hilly region, scattered over with villages and cultivated fields, as well as with woods of banana-trees. The study area received an average rainfall of 964.36 mm per year, the highest peak recorded in 1951. The trend of rainfall showed that many years had rainfall below the average while the temperature was found to increase from year to year, the situation which suggests the existence of climate change in the study area. Flora and fauna Its shores and waters are favored by birds, such as cranes, herons, pelicans, African jacanas, egrets and waders, which find excellent feeding over the large spaces near the extremities and shore line of bays. These are covered with close-packed growths of Pistia stratiotes rigl plants. Kobus ellipsiprymnus and Hippopotamus amphibius frequent the area. There are armies of black mosquitoes. Lake fish were infested with guinea worm at the time of Stanley's expedition.

A nephew of 1940s player, Phil McCarthy, Pat McCarthy was a naturally strong player with excellent hands and a good jump. He was part of the Kerry Under-21 team in the early 1970s but had to wait till the demise of the great Mick O'Connell and the failure of young midfield pretenders like DJ Crowley and John O'Keeffe before getting a proper chance on the senior squad in 1975 under Mick O'Dwyer. He soon became the obvious partner to Paudie Lynch. Many times that season he did most of the heavier lifting at midfield where his strength maintained control against opponents who played rough or fair. McCarthy made his first championship appearance for the team during the 1975 championship and became a regular member of the starting fifteen over subsequent seasons. During that time he won one All-Ireland winner's medal and three Munster winner's medals in four championship seasons. McCarthy's greatest display was in the 1976 Munster final - a game regarded by many sportswriters as the greatest game of Gaelic football ever. Against a surprisingly determined Cork team, Kerry were taken to equal scores after 70 minutes. In extra time McCarthy's strength and inspirational determination from midfield singlehandedly turned the tide for Kerry, who won out in the end by 3-20 to 2-19. In that year's All-Ireland final however Kerry lost by 3-8 to 0-10 to a resurgent Dublin team. No doubt his being based neither in Kerry nor in Dublin did not count in his favour as far as training was concerned. That year also saw the start of Jack O'Shea as a new midfielder for Kerry, with his future partner, Sean Walsh also being brought in - initially as a substitute in the forward line. Nonetheless many people felt that McCarthy deserved more senior outings for Kerry than he received from Mick O'Dwyer over subsequent seasons. McCarthy later switched to playing his football in Kildare, playing club football for Sallins and league/championship senior games for Kildare. When his playing days finished, McCarthy was involved in coaching and selector for the Kildare county team, notably for their nearly successful championship season in 1998 when they defeated Kerry in the semi-final but lost to Galway in the All-Ireland final. At club level, McCarthy played with both the Churchill club in Kerry and later with Sallins in Kildare. He remains a reasonably frequent and always welcome visitor to Kerry, particularly to his home parish, Churchill, where his sporting achievements remain a matter of great pride to many local people.

It has both launched its own missions and provided funding for private-sector missions. A number of NASA missions, including the Explorers Program, Voyager program, and New Frontiers program, are ongoing. List of missions =Explorers Program (1958‚Äìpresent)= Explorer 1 satellite. The Explorer program has launched more than 90 missions since it began more than five decades ago. It has matured into one of NASA's lower-cost mission programs. The program started as a U.S. Army proposal to place a scientific satellite into orbit during the International Geophysical Year (1957‚Äì58). However, that proposal was rejected in favor of the U.S. Navy's Project Vanguard. The Explorer program was later reestablished to catch up with the Soviet Union after the launch of Sputnik 1 in October 1957. Explorer 1 was launched January 31, 1958; at this time the project still belonged to the Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA) and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Clayton Koppes, \\"JPL and the American Space Program,\\" (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1982); Erik M. Conway, \\"From Rockets to Spacecraft: Making JPL a Place for Planetary Science ,\\" Engineering and Science, vol. 30, nr. 4, pp. 2‚Äì10. Besides being the first U.S. satellite, it is known for discovering the Van Allen radiation belt. The Explorer program was later transferred to NASA, which continued to use the name for an ongoing series of relatively small space missions, typically an artificial satellite with a science focus. Over the years, NASA has launched a series of Explorer spacecraft carrying a wide variety of scientific investigations. =Pioneer program (1958‚Äì1978)= Pioneer H in the National Air and Space Museum The Pioneer program was a series of NASA uncrewed space missions designed for planetary exploration. There were a number of missions in the program, most notably Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11, which explored the outer planets and left the solar system. Both carry a golden plaque, depicting a man and a woman and information about the origin and the creators of the probes, should any extraterrestrials find them someday. Additionally, the Pioneer mission to Venus consisted of two components, launched separately. Pioneer Venus 1 (Pioneer Venus Orbiter) was launched in May 1978 and remained in orbit until 1992. Pioneer Venus 2 (Pioneer Venus Multiprobe), launched in August 1978, sent four small probes into the Venusian atmosphere. =Project Echo (1960‚Äì1964)= Echo 2 in a hangar, N. Carolina. People can be seen on the floor. Project Echo was the first passive communications satellite experiment. Each spacecraft was a metalized balloon satellite to be inflated in space and acting as a passive reflector of microwave signals. Communication signals were bounced off of them from one point on Earth to another. NASA's Echo 1 satellite was built by Gilmore Schjeldahl Company in Northfield, Minnesota. Following the failure of the Delta rocket carrying Echo 1 on May 13, 1960, Echo 1A was put successfully into orbit by another Thor-Delta, and the first microwave transmission was received on August 12, 1960. Echo 2 was a 41.1-meter (135 ft) diameter metalized PET film balloon, which was the last balloon satellite launched by Project Echo. It used an improved inflation system to improve the balloon's smoothness and sphericity. It was launched January 25, 1964, on a Thor Agena rocket. =Ranger program (1961‚Äì1965)= The Ranger program was a series of uncrewed space missions by the United States in the 1960s whose objective was to obtain the first close-up images of the surface of the Moon. The Ranger spacecraft were designed to take images of the lunar surface, returning those images until they were destroyed upon impact. A series of mishaps, however, led to the failure of the first five flights. Congress launched an investigation into \\"problems of management\\" at NASA Headquarters and JPL. After reorganizing the organization twice, Ranger 7 successfully returned images in July 1964, followed by two more successful missions. Ranger was originally designed, beginning in 1959, in three distinct phases, called \\"blocks.\\" Each block had different mission objectives and progressively more advanced system design. The JPL mission designers planned multiple launches in each block, to maximize the engineering experience and scientific value of the mission and to assure at least one successful flight. Total research, development, launch, and support costs for the Ranger series of spacecraft (Rangers 1 through 9) was approximately $170 million. = Telstar (1962‚Äì1963) = Telstar 1 Telstar was not a NASA program but rather a commercial communication satellite project. NASA's contributions to it were limited to launch services, as well as tracking and telemetry duties. The first two Telstar satellites were experimental and nearly identical. Telstar 1 was launched on top of a Thor-Delta rocket on July 10, 1962. It successfully relayed through space the first television pictures, telephone calls, and fax images, as well as providing the first live transatlantic television feed. Telstar 2 was launched May 7, 1963. Bell Telephone Laboratories designed and built the Telstar satellites. They were prototypes intended to prove various concepts behind the large constellation of orbiting satellites. Bell Telephone Laboratories also developed much of the technology required for satellite communication, including transistors, solar cells, and traveling wave tube amplifiers. AT&T; built ground stations to handle Telstar communications. Chapter 6, NASA Experimental Communications Satellites, 1958‚Äì1995 . Retrieved October 23, 2011 =Mariner program (1962‚Äì1973)= Mariner 6 The Mariner program conducted by NASA launched a series of robotic interplanetary probes designed to investigate Mars, Venus and Mercury. The program included a number of firsts, including the first planetary flyby, the first pictures from another planet, the first planetary orbiter, and the first interplanetary gravity assist maneuver. Of the ten vehicles in the Mariner series, seven were successful, and three were lost. The planned Mariner 11 and Mariner 12 vehicles evolved into Voyager 1 and Voyager 2, while the Viking 1 and Viking 2 Mars orbiters were enlarged versions of the Mariner 9 spacecraft. Other Mariner-based spacecraft included the Magellan probe to Venus and the Galileo probe to Jupiter. The second-generation Mariner spacecraft, called the Mariner Mark II series, eventually evolved into the Cassini‚ÄìHuygens probe, which spent more than 13 years in orbit around Saturn. All Mariner spacecraft were based on a hexagonal or octagonal \\"bus,\\" which housed all of the electronics, and to which all components were attached, such as antennae, cameras, propulsion, and power sources. All probes except Mariner 1, Mariner 2 and Mariner 5 had TV cameras. The first five Mariners were launched on Atlas-Agena rockets, while the last five used the Atlas-Centaur. =Lunar Orbiter program (1966‚Äì1967)= Lunar Orbiter spacecraft (NASA) The Lunar Orbiter program was a series of five uncrewed lunar orbiter missions launched by the United States, starting in 1966. It was intended to help select landing sites for the Apollo program by mapping the Moon's surface. Bowker, David E. and J. Kenrick Hughes, Lunar Orbiter Photographic Atlas of the Moon , NASA SP-206 (1971). The program produced the first photographs ever taken from lunar orbit. All five missions were successful, and 99% of the Moon was mapped from photographs taken with a resolution of or better. The first three missions were dedicated to imaging 20 potential human lunar landing sites, selected based on Earth-based observations. These were flown at low inclination orbits. The fourth and fifth missions were devoted to broader scientific objectives and were flown in high- altitude polar orbits. All Lunar Orbiter craft were launched by an Atlas-Agena D launch vehicle. During the Lunar Orbiter missions, the first pictures of Earth as a whole were taken, beginning with Earth-rise over the lunar surface by Lunar Orbiter 1 in August 1966. The first full picture of the whole Earth was taken by Lunar Orbiter 5 on August 8, 1967. A second photo of the whole Earth was taken by Lunar Orbiter 5 on November 10, 1967. =Surveyor program (1966‚Äì1968)= Apollo 12 astronaut inspecting Surveyor 3. Lunar module is seen in the background. 1969 The Surveyor Program was a NASA program that, from 1966 through 1968, sent seven robotic spacecraft to the surface of the Moon. Its primary goal was to demonstrate the feasibility of soft landings on the Moon. The program was implemented by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to prepare for the Apollo program. The total cost of the Surveyor program was officially $469 million. Five of the Surveyor craft successfully soft-landed on the Moon. Two failed: Surveyor 2 crashed at high velocity after a failed mid-course correction, and Surveyor 4 was lost for contact 2.5 minutes before its scheduled touch-down. All seven spacecraft are still on the Moon; none of the missions included returning them to Earth. Some parts of Surveyor 3 were returned to Earth by the crew of Apollo 12, which landed near it in 1969. =Helios probes (1974‚Äì1976)= Helios probe spacecraft Helios I and Helios II, also known as Helios-A and Helios-B, were a pair of space probes launched into heliocentric orbit for the purpose of studying solar processes. A joint venture of the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) and NASA, the probes were launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida, on December 10, 1974, and January 15, 1976, respectively. Helios 2 set a maximum speed record among spacecraft at about relative to the Sun ( or 0.000229c). The Helios space probes completed their primary missions by the early 1980s, but they continued to send data up to 1985. The probes are no longer functional but still remain in their elliptical orbit around the Sun. =Viking program (1975)= Viking at Mars releasing the descent capsule, artist concept The Viking program consisted of a pair of American space probes sent to Mars‚ÄîViking 1 and Viking 2. Each vehicle was composed of two main parts, an orbiter designed to photograph the surface of Mars from orbit, and a lander designed to study the planet from the surface. The orbiters also served as communication relays for the landers once they touched down. Viking 1 was launched on August 20, 1975, and the second craft, Viking 2, was launched on September 9, 1975, both riding atop Titan III-E rockets with Centaur upper stages. By discovering many geological forms that are typically formed from large amounts of water, the Viking program caused a revolution in scientific ideas about water on Mars. The primary objectives of the Viking orbiters were to transport the landers to Mars, perform reconnaissance to locate and certify landing sites, act as communications relays for the landers, and to perform their own scientific investigations. The orbiter, based on the earlier Mariner 9 spacecraft, was an octagon approximately across. The total launch mass was , of which were propellant and attitude control gas. =Voyager program (1977‚Äìpresent)= Voyager probe The Voyager program consists of a pair of uncrewed scientific probes, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2. They were launched in 1977 to take advantage of a favorable planetary alignment of the late 1970s. Although they were originally designated to study just Jupiter and Saturn, Voyager 2 was able to continue to Uranus and Neptune. Both missions have gathered large amounts of data about the gas giants of the solar system, of which little was previously known. Both probes have achieved escape velocity from the Solar System and will never return. Voyager 1 entered interstellar space in 2012. , Voyager 1 was at a distance of 145.148 AU () from the Earth, traveling away from the Sun at a speed of about , which corresponds to a greater specific orbital energy than any other probe. =High Energy Astronomy Observatory 1 (1977)= HEAO 1 Satellite The first of NASA's three High Energy Astronomy Observatories, HEAO 1, launched August 12, 1977, aboard an Atlas rocket with a Centaur upper stage, operated until January 9, 1979. During that time, it scanned the X-ray sky almost three times over 0.2 keV ‚Äì 10 MeV, provided nearly constant monitoring of X-ray sources near the ecliptic poles, as well as more detailed studies of a number of objects through pointed observations. HEAO included four large X-ray and gamma-ray astronomy instruments, known as A1, A2, A3, and A4, respectively (before launch, HEAO 1 was known as HEAO A). The orbital inclination was about 22.7 degrees. HEAO 1 re-entered the Earth's atmosphere on March 15, 1979. =Solar Maximum Mission (1980)= SMM satellite The Solar Maximum Mission satellite (or SolarMax) was designed to investigate solar phenomena, particularly solar flares. It was launched on February 14, 1980. Although not unique in this endeavor, the SMM was notable in that its useful life compared with similar spacecraft was significantly increased by the direct intervention of a human space mission. During STS-41-C in 1984, the Space Shuttle Challenger intercepted the SMM, maneuvering it into the shuttle's payload bay for maintenance and repairs. SMM had been fitted with a shuttle \\"grapple fixture\\" so that the shuttle's robot arm could grab it for repair. The Solar Maximum Mission ended on December 2, 1989, when the spacecraft re-entered the atmosphere and burned up. = Infrared Astronomical Satellite (1983)= IRAS beside some of its all-sky images The Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) was the first-ever space- based observatory to perform a survey of the entire sky at infrared wavelengths. IRAS Explanatory Supplement II. Satellite Description IPAC IRAS archive It discovered about 350,000 sources, many of which are still awaiting identification. New discoveries included a dust disk around Vega and the first images of the Milky Way Galaxy's core. IRAS's life, like those of most infrared satellites that followed it, was limited by its cooling system. To effectively work in the infrared domain, the telescope must be cooled to cryogenic temperatures. Superfluid helium kept IRAS at a temperature of 2 kelvins (about ‚àí271 ¬∞C) by evaporation. The supply of liquid helium was depleted on November 21, 1983, preventing further observations. The spacecraft continues to orbit close to the Earth. The telescope was a joint project of the United States (NASA), the Netherlands (NIVR), and the United Kingdom (SERC). Over 250,000 infrared sources were observed at 12, 25, 60, and 100 micrometer wavelengths. =Magellan probe (1989)= The Magellan Probe prepared for launch The Magellan spacecraft was a space probe sent to the planet Venus, the first uncrewed interplanetary spacecraft to be launched by NASA since its successful Pioneer Orbiter, also to Venus, in 1978. It was also the first deep-space probe to be launched on the Space Shuttle. In 1993, it employed aerobraking techniques to lower its orbit. This was the first prolonged use of the technique, which had been tested by Hiten in 1991. Magellan created the first (and currently the best) high-resolution mapping of the planet's surface features. Prior Venus missions had created low-resolution radar globes of general, continent-sized formations. Magellan, performed detailed imaging and analysis of craters, hills, ridges, and other geologic formations, to a degree comparable to the visible-light photographic mapping of other planets. =Galileo (1989)= The Galileo probe Galileo was an uncrewed spacecraft sent by NASA to study the planet Jupiter and its moons. It was launched on October 18, 1989, by the Space Shuttle Atlantis on the STS-34 mission. It arrived at Jupiter on December 7, 1995, via gravitational assist flybys of Venus and Earth. Despite antenna problems, Galileo conducted the first asteroid flyby, discovered the first asteroid moon, was the first spacecraft to orbit Jupiter, and launched the first probe into Jupiter's atmosphere. Galileo's prime mission was a two-year study of the Jovian system. The spacecraft traveled around Jupiter in elongated ellipses, each orbit lasting about two months. The differing distances from Jupiter afforded by these orbits allowed Galileo to sample different parts of the planet's extensive magnetosphere. The orbits were designed for close up flybys of Jupiter's largest moons. Once Galileo's prime mission was concluded, an extended mission followed starting on December 7, 1997; the spacecraft made a number of close flybys of Jupiter's moons Europa and Io. On September 21, 2003, Galileo's mission was terminated by sending the orbiter into Jupiter's atmosphere at a speed of nearly 50 kilometers per second. The spacecraft was low on propellant; another reason for its destruction was to avoid contamination of local moons, such as Europa, with bacteria from Earth. =Hubble Space Telescope (1990)= The Hubble Space Telescope The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) is a space telescope that was carried into orbit by a Space Shuttle in April 1990. It is named after American astronomer Edwin Hubble. Although not the first space telescope, Hubble is one of the largest and most versatile, and is well known as both a vital research tool and a public relations boon for astronomy. The HST is a collaboration between NASA and the European Space Agency, and is one of NASA's Great Observatories, along with the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, and the Spitzer Space Telescope. The HST's success has paved the way for greater collaboration between the agencies. The HST was created with a budget of $2 billion Chapter 12, and has continued operation since 1990, delighting both scientists and the public. Some of its images, such as the Hubble Deep Field, have become famous. =Ulysses (1990)= Ulysses (artist rendering) Ulysses is a decommissioned robotic space probe that was designed to study the Sun as a joint venture of NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA). Ulysses was launched on October 6, 1990, aboard Discovery (mission STS-41). The spacecraft's mission was to study the Sun at all latitudes. This required a major orbital plane shift, which was accomplished by using an encounter with Jupiter. The need for a Jupiter encounter meant that Ulysses could not be powered by solar cells and was powered by a radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) instead. By February 2008, the power output from the RTG, which is generated by heat from radioactive decay, had decreased enough to leave insufficient power to keep the spacecraft's attitude control hydrazine fuel from freezing. Mission scientists kept the fuel liquid by conducting short thruster burns, allowing the mission to continue. The cessation of mission operations and deactivation of the spacecraft was determined by the inability to prevent attitude control fuel from freezing. Solar wind blows at 50-year low 2008-09-24, Jonathan Amos, BBC News Online. Retrieved September 28, 2008 The last day for mission operations on Ulysses was June 30, 2009. =Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (1991)= Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) deployed The Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) was a science satellite used from 1991 to 2005 to study Earth's atmosphere, including the ozone layer. Planned for a three-year mission, it proved much more durable, allowing extended observation from its instrument suite. It was launched aboard Space Shuttle Discovery and deployed into space from the payload bay with its robotic arm, under guidance from the crew. The satellite underwent atmospheric re-entry at about 04:00 24 September 2011 UTC. At about 6 tonnes, it was the heaviest NASA satellite to undergo uncontrolled atmospheric entry since Skylab in the summer of 1979. =Discovery Program (1992‚Äìpresent)= Mars Pathfinder on Mars NASA's Discovery Program (as compared to New Frontiers or Flagship Programs) is a series of lower-cost, highly focused scientific space missions that are exploring the Solar System. It was founded in 1992 to implement then-NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin's vision of \\"faster, better, cheaper\\" planetary missions. Discovery missions differ from traditional NASA missions where targets and objectives are pre- specified. Instead, these cost-capped missions are proposed and led by a scientist called the Principal investigator (PI). Proposing teams may include people from industry, small businesses, government laboratories, and universities. Proposals are selected through a competitive peer review process. The Discovery missions are adding significantly to the body of knowledge about the Solar System. Kepler space telescope NASA also accepts proposals for competitively selected Discovery Program Missions of Opportunity. This provides opportunities to participate in non-NASA missions by providing funding for a science instrument or hardware components of a science instrument or to re-purpose an existing NASA spacecraft. Missions funded by NASA through this program include Mars Pathfinder, Kepler, Stardust, Genesis and Deep Impact. The Mars Pathfinder (MESUR Pathfinder) was launched on December 4, 1996, just a month after the Mars Global Surveyor was launched. On board the lander, later renamed the Carl Sagan Memorial Station, was a small rover called Sojourner that executed many experiments on the Martian surface. It was the second project from NASA's Discovery Program. The mission was directed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology, responsible for NASA's Mars Exploration Program. Genesis spacecraft Stardust was a 300-kilogram robotic space probe launched by NASA on February 7, 1999, to study the asteroid 5535 Annefrank and collect samples from the coma of comet Wild 2. The primary mission was completed January 15, 2006, when the sample return capsule returned to Earth. Stardust intercepted comet Tempel 1 on February 15, 2011, a small Solar System body previously visited by Deep Impact on July 4, 2005. Stardust was decommissioned on March 25, 2011. It is the first sample return mission to collect cosmic dust. Deep Impact space probe after impactor separation (artist concept) The Genesis spacecraft was a NASA sample return probe which collected a sample of solar wind and returned it to Earth for analysis. It was the first NASA sample return mission to return material since the Apollo Program, and the first to return material from beyond the orbit of the Moon.The NASA Stardust mission launched two years before Genesis, but did not return to Earth until two years after Genesis's return. Genesis was launched on August 8, 2001, and crash- landed in Utah on September 8, 2004, after a design flaw prevented the deployment of its drogue parachute. The crash contaminated and damaged many of the sample collectors, but many of them were successfully recovered. Deep Impact is a NASA space probe launched on January 12, 2005. It was designed to study the composition of the interior of comet 9P/Tempel, by releasing an impactor into the comet. On July 4, 2005, the impactor successfully collided with the comet's nucleus, excavating debris from the interior of the nucleus. Photographs of the debris and impact crater showed that the comet was very porous and its outgassing was chemically diverse. Kepler is a space observatory launched by NASA to discover Earth-like planets orbiting other stars. The spacecraft, named in honor of the 17th-century German astronomer Johannes Kepler, was launched in March 2009. Kepler's primary mission ended in May 2013 when it lost a second reaction wheel. The telescope's second mission, K2, began in May 2014. As of February 2018, Kepler has discovered more than 2000 exoplanets. =Clementine (1994)= Clementine satellite Clementine (officially called the Deep Space Program Science Experiment (DSPSE)) was a joint space project between the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO, previously the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization, or SDIO) and NASA. Launched on January 25, 1994, the objective of the mission was to test sensors and spacecraft components under extended exposure to the space environment and to make scientific observations of the Moon and the near-Earth asteroid 1620 Geographos. The Geographos observations were not made due to a malfunction in the spacecraft. =Mars Global Surveyor (1996)= Artist's conception of the Mars Global Surveyor The Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) was developed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and launched November 1996. It began the United States' return to Mars after a 10-year absence. It completed its primary mission in January 2001 and was in its third extended mission phase when, on November 2, 2006, the spacecraft failed to respond to commands. In January 2007 NASA officially ended the mission. The Surveyor spacecraft used a series of high-resolution cameras to explore the surface of Mars, returning more than 240,000 images from September 1997 to November 2006. The surveyor had three cameras; a high-resolution camera took black-and-white images (usually 1.5 to 12 m per pixel), and red and blue wide-angle cameras took images for context (240 m per pixel) and daily global images ( per pixel).Malin, M. et al. Mars Global Surveyor Mars Orbiter Camera in the Extended Mission: The MOC Toolkit, 35th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, March 15‚Äì19, 2004, League City, Texas, abstract no.1189 =Cassini‚ÄìHuygens (1997‚Äì2017)= Artist's concept of Cassini's Saturn orbit insertion Cassini‚ÄìHuygens was a joint NASA/ESA/ASI spacecraft mission studying the planet Saturn and its many natural satellites. It included a Saturn orbiter and an atmospheric probe/lander for the moon Titan, although it also returned data on a wide variety of other things including the Heliosphere, Jupiter, and relativity tests. The Titan probe, Huygens, entered and landed on Titan in 2005. Cassini was the fourth space probe to visit Saturn and the first to enter orbit. It launched on October 15, 1997, on a Titan IVB/Centaur and entered into orbit around Saturn on July 1, 2004, after an interplanetary voyage which included flybys of Earth, Venus, and Jupiter. On December 25, 2004, Huygens separated from the orbiter at approximately 02:00 UTC. It reached Saturn's moon Titan on January 14, 2005, when it entered Titan's atmosphere and descended down to the surface. It successfully returned data to Earth, using the orbiter as a relay. This was the first landing ever accomplished in the outer Solar System. Sixteen European countries and the United States made up the team responsible for designing, building, flying and collecting data from the Cassini orbiter and Huygens probe. The mission was managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in the United States, where the orbiter was assembled. Huygens was developed by the European Space Research and Technology Centre. After several mission extensions, Cassini was deliberately plunged into Saturn's atmosphere on September 15, 2017, to prevent contamination of habitable moons. =Earth Observing System (1997‚Äìpresent)= NASA Earth observatories The Earth Observing System (EOS) is a program of NASA comprising a series of artificial satellite missions and scientific instruments in Earth orbit designed for long-term global observations of the land surface, biosphere, atmosphere, and oceans of the Earth. The satellite component of the program was launched in 1997. The program is the centerpiece of NASA's Earth Science Enterprise (ESE). Missions carried out through this program include SeaWiFS (1997), Landsat 7 (1999), QuikSCAT (1999), Jason 1 (2001), GRACE (2002), Aqua (2002), Aura (2004) and Aquarius (2011). =New Millennium Program (1998‚Äì2006)= Artist rendering of Deep Space I's flyby of comet 19P/Borrelly New Millennium Program (NMP) is a NASA project with a focus on engineering validation of new technologies for space applications. Funding for the program was eliminated from the FY2009 budget by the 110th United States Congress, effectively leading to its cancellation. The spacecraft in the New Millennium Program were originally named \\"Deep Space\\" (for missions demonstrating technology for planetary missions) and \\"Earth Observing\\" (for missions demonstrating technology for Earth-orbiting missions). With a refocusing of the program in 2000, the Deep Space series was renamed \\"Space Technology.\\" Deep Space 1 (DS1) is a spacecraft dedicated to testing a payload of advanced, high-risk technologies. Launched on October 24, 1998, the Deep Space 1 mission carried out a flyby of asteroid 9969 Braille, the mission's science target. Its mission was extended twice to include an encounter with Comet Borrelly and further engineering testing. Problems during its initial stages and with its star tracker led to repeated changes in mission configuration. Deep Space 1 tested twelve technologies. It was the first spacecraft to use ion thrusters, in contrast to the traditional chemical powered rockets. The Deep Space series was continued by the Deep Space 2 probes, which were launched in January 1999 on Mars Polar Lander and were intended to strike the surface of Mars. =Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (2002)= Artist's concept of the twin GRACE satellites The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), a joint mission of NASA and the German Aerospace Center, made detailed measurements of Earth's gravity field from its launch in March 2002 until October 2017. The satellites were launched from Plesetsk Cosmodrome, Russia on a Rockot launch vehicle. By measuring gravity, GRACE showed how mass is distributed around the planet and how it varies over time. Data from the GRACE satellites is an important tool for studying Earth's ocean, geology, and climate. GRACE was a collaborative endeavor involving the Center for Space Research at the University of Texas, Austin; NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.; the German Space Agency and Germany's National Research Center for Geosciences, Potsdam. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory was responsible for the overall mission management under the NASA ESSP program. =Mars Exploration Rover (2003-2019)= Artist's conception of MER on Mars NASA's Mars Exploration Rover Mission (MER), was a robotic space mission involving two rovers exploring the planet Mars. The mission is managed for NASA by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which designed, built and is operating the rovers. The mission began in 2003 with the sending of the two rovers‚ÄîMER-A Spirit and MER-B Opportunity‚Äîto explore the Martian surface and geology. The mission's scientific objective is to search for and study rocks and soils that indicate past water activity. The mission is part of NASA's Mars Exploration Program which includes three previous successful landers: the two Viking program landers in 1976 and Mars Pathfinder probe in 1997. The total cost of building, launching, landing and operating the rovers on the surface for the initial 90-Martian-day (sol) primary mission was US$820 million. However, both rovers were able to continue functioning beyond the initial 90-day mission, and received multiple mission extensions. The Spirit rover remained operational until 2009, while the Opportunity rover remained operational until 2018. =MESSENGER (2004‚Äì2015)= MESSENGER (artist concept) MESSENGER (an acronym of MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging) was a robotic spacecraft that orbited the planet Mercury, the first spacecraft ever to do so. The spacecraft was launched aboard a Delta II rocket in August 2004 to study Mercury's chemical composition, geology, and magnetic field. MESSENGER used its instruments on a complex series of flybys that allowed it to decelerate relative to Mercury using minimal fuel. The spacecraft flew by Earth once and Venus twice. Then it flew by Mercury three times, in January 2008, October 2008, and September 2009, becoming the second mission to reach Mercury, after Mariner 10. MESSENGER entered orbit around Mercury on March 18, 2011, and it reactivated its science instruments on March 24, returning the first photo from Mercury orbit on March 29. MESSENGER crashed into Mercury on April 30, 2015, after running out of propellant. =New Frontiers program (2006‚Äìpresent)= The New Frontiers program is a series of space exploration missions being conducted by NASA with the purpose of researching several of the Sun's planets including Jupiter, Venus, and the dwarf planet Pluto. NASA is encouraging both domestic and international scientists to submit mission proposals for the project. New Frontiers was built on the approach used by the Discovery and Explorer Programs of principal investigator-led missions. It is designed for medium-class missions that could not be accomplished within the cost and time constraints of the Discovery Program, but are not as large as Flagship-class missions. There are currently three New Frontiers missions in progress. New Horizons was launched on January 19, 2006, and flew by Pluto in July 2015. A flyby of 486958 Arrokoth took place in 2019. Juno was launched on August 5, 2011, and entered orbit around Jupiter on July 4, 2016. OSIRIS-REx, launched on September 8, 2016, plans on returning a sample to Earth on September 24, 2023, and if successful, would be the first U.S. spacecraft to do so.  Commercial Resupply Services (2006‚Äìpresent)  The development of the Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) vehicles began in 2006 with the purpose of creating American commercially operated uncrewed cargo vehicles to service the ISS. The development of these vehicles was under a fixed-price, milestone-based program, meaning that each company that received a funded award had a list of milestones with a dollar value attached to them that they did not receive until after they had successfully completed the milestone. Companies were also required to raise an unspecified amount of private investment for their proposal. On December 23, 2008, NASA awarded Commercial Resupply Services contracts to SpaceX and Orbital Sciences Corporation. SpaceX uses its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft. Orbital Sciences uses its Antares rocket and Cygnus spacecraft. The first Dragon resupply mission occurred in May 2012. The first Cygnus resupply mission occurred in September 2013. The CRS program now provides for all America's ISS cargo needs, with the exception of a few vehicle-specific payloads that are delivered on the European ATV and the Japanese HTV. =Mars Scout Program (2007‚Äì2008)= Artist's impression of the Phoenix spacecraft as it lands on Mars The Mars Scout Program was a NASA initiative to send a series of small, low-cost robotic missions to Mars, competitively selected from proposals by the scientific community. Each Scout project was to cost less than US$485 million. The Phoenix lander and MAVEN orbiter were selected and developed before the program was retired in 2010. Phoenix was a lander adapted from the canceled Mars Surveyor mission. Phoenix was launched on August 4, 2007, and landed in the icy northern polar region of the planet on May 25, 2008. Phoenix was designed to search for environments suitable for microbial life on Mars and to research the history of water there. The 90-day primary mission was successful, and the overall mission was concluded on November 10, 2008, after engineers were unable to contact the craft. The lander last made a brief communication with Earth on November 2, 2008. =Dawn (2007‚Äì2018)= Dawn, artist concept Dawn is a NASA spacecraft tasked with the exploration and study of the asteroid Vesta and the dwarf planet Ceres, the two largest members of the asteroid belt. The spacecraft was constructed with some European cooperation, with components contributed by partners in Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands. The Dawn mission is managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Dawn is the first spacecraft to visit either Vesta or Ceres. It is also the first spacecraft to orbit two separate extraterrestrial bodies, using ion thrusters to travel between its targets. Previous multi-target missions using conventional drives, such as the Voyager program, were restricted to flybys. Launched on September 27, 2007, Dawn entered orbit around Vesta on July 16, 2011, and explored it until September 5, 2012. Thereafter, the spacecraft headed to Ceres and started to orbit the dwarf planet on March 6, 2015. In November 2018, NASA reported that Dawn had run out of fuel, effectively ending its mission; it will remain in orbit around Ceres, but can no longer communicate with Earth. =Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (2009)= Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, artist concept The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) is a NASA robotic spacecraft currently orbiting the Moon on a low polar mapping orbit. The LRO mission is a precursor to future human missions to the Moon by NASA. To this end, a detailed mapping program identifies safe landing sites, locates potential resources on the Moon, characterizes the radiation environment, and demonstrates new technology. The probe has made a 3-D map of the Moon's surface and has provided some of the first images of Apollo equipment left on the Moon. The first images from LRO were published on July 2, 2009, showing a region in the lunar highlands south of Mare Nubium (Sea of Clouds). Launched on June 18, 2009, in conjunction with the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS), as the vanguard of NASA's Lunar Precursor Robotic Program, this is the first United States mission to the Moon in over ten years. LRO and LCROSS are the first missions launched as part of the United States's Vision for Space Exploration program. = Mars Science Laboratory (2011)= Mars Curiosity Rover, artist's concept Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) is a NASA mission to land and operate a rover named Curiosity on the surface of Mars. It was launched by an Atlas V rocket on November 26, 2011, and landed successfully on August 6, 2012, on the plains of Aeolis Palus in Gale Crater near Aeolis Mons (formerly Mount Sharp). On Mars, it is helping to assess Mars' habitability. It can chemically analyze samples by scooping up soil and drilling rocks using a laser and sensor system. The Curiosity rover is about two times longer and fives times more massive than the Spirit or Opportunity Mars Exploration Rovers and carries more than ten times the mass of scientific instruments.

Hugo Ticciati (born April 12, 1980) is a British-born violinist, living in Sweden. He has been successful in several worldwide events such as the Gotland Chamber Music Festival (Sweden), the St. Denis- Festival (Paris), and the Festival Internacional Cervantino. He has also begun his own Festival called the O/MOD∆èRNT, in Sweden. Hugo Ticciati looks very similar to Harry Potter, which he acted at a concert with Lilla Akademien 2019 at Valentine's Day. Career At twelve he entered the world of fame in the Edinburgh Festival and at Queen Elizabeth Hall. Since then, Ticciati has been performing with several orchestras from England, Romania, Sweden, the Far East, Estonia and the USA. Some of his career highlights have taken place in concertos performed in the Baltic Sea Festival in Sweden, the Carnegie Hall, and the Hermitage Music Festival held in St Petersburg. Ticciati currently gives regular concerts in important halls in Europe and in the Far East. He plays accompanied by pianists such as Staffan Scheja, Svetlana Navarssadian, Sophia Rahman, Michael Tsalka and Henrik M√•we. Hugo normally gives masterclasses and seminars on violin teaching and lectures on music-related subjects all over the world. In autumn 2008, he was invited to become the guest violin teacher and lecturer in music history at a new university in New York. Hugo‚Äôs teaching basically searches for ways to apply the physical and spiritual aspects of meditation to practicing art, playing and living in music. London was the place where Hugo started studying violin, before going to the University of Toronto. He continued studying with the Russian violinists, Nina and Oleg Balabina in Sweden, where he now is considered as a Swedish citizen. Hugo has won the international competitions Giovani Talenti and Rovere d‚ÄôOro at San Bartolomeo al Mare, Italy (2002), and the Mendelssohn Cup in Bari, Italy (2004). In 2007 he was admitted as a Fellow of the Royal Schools of Music in the United Kingdom. Projects Ticciati has started a new festival named O/MOD∆èRNT (which means ‚ÄúUnmodern‚Äù) as artistic director at Ulrikdals Palace Theatre Confidencen, in Sweden. Ticciati‚Äôs philosophy about the festival establishes that the best way to outperform is creating a premeditated concept of what the expectation of the festival should be. He is interested in looking back to the past and structuring his own musical vision, just as Bach did. That is why his first O/ Modernt festival was focused on Bach's music and its influences in the musical world since his death. Hugo works in the contemporary music world with composers such as Albert Schnelzer, Anders Hillborg, Djuro Zivkovic, Leonardo Coral, Andrea Tarrodi, Tobias Brostr√∂m, Thomas Jennefelt, Sergei Yevtushenko and Esaias J√§rnegard. Within other projects, he is working with Bill Connor (English composer), on ‚ÄúAn Improvised Violin Concerto‚Äù. Over the next seasons, Ticciati will be performing concertos in Russia, Romania, Sweden, England and Mexico. Music Festivals Ticciati has been invited to several renowned musical events, such as the Gotland Chamber Music Festival (Sweden), the St. Denis-Festival (Paris), and the Festival Internacional Cervantino, which is annually held in Guanajuato, Mexico. For this year (2011) Sweden, a guest of honor in FIC, will be represented by Angereds Teater, √Öke Parmerud, Stockholm Jazz Orchestra, and Hugo Ticciati, who will be working with Michael Tsalka.

It is a right tributary of the Moselotte, and thus a sub-tributary of the Rhine, via the Moselotte and the Moselle. It is long.  Geography  The Cleurie rises in the massif des Vosges, within the commune of G√©rardmer from the confluence of two streams, the Corsaire and the Noir Rupt. It receives Li√©zey stream on its right, flows through Le Tholy, follows La Forge, Le Syndicat and Cleurie, then flows into the right bank of the Moselotte at Saint-Am√©. Its name is found in the denomination of the Communaut√© de communes de la Vall√©e de la Cleurie.  Hydrology  The flow rate of the Cleurie river has been measured at Cleurie over 38 years from 1967 to 2007. The measurement station is from the river's confluence with the Moselotte.Banque Hydro - Station A4173010 - La Cleurie √† Cleurie (option Synth√®se) The watershed of the river there is , or about 88 percent of that at its mouth. The river's average interannual flow rate or discharge at Cleurie is . The Cleurie river exhibits moderate seasonal variation in flow rate. High water occurs at the end of autumn and in winter, and are typified by monthly average instantaneous flow rates of between , from November to March inclusive, with a maximum in December and January. Low water occurs in spring, from July to September inclusive, with a minimum monthly average flow rate of in August. These monthly averages, however, hide more pronounced short-term variations, especially since the flow rate varies from year to year. At low water, the 3-year low instantaneous flow rate can drop to , or , which is hardly very severe. Floods can be very significant for a small river endowed with a minimal basin. The maximum instantaneous flow rates over a 2-year and 5-year period (MIFR2 and MIFR5) measure respectively. The MIFR10 measures , the MIFR20 measures and the MIFR50 measures . These numbers correspond to about a third of the flooding flow rates of the Moselotte. The maximum instaneous flow rate ever recorded at Cleurie over the entire period for which measurements exist was on 25 January 1995, while the maximum ever recorded daily average value was the same day. Comparing these values with the scale of the MIFR's listed above suggests that the floods of January 1995 were almost of the order of IMFR50 and quite exceptional, and that a flood of that size should occur on average once every 40 years. All in all, the Cleurie is a very significant river. The runoff curve number in its watershed is annually, which is more than three times higher than the overall average of France, and substantially more than the average of the whole French Moselle basin measured at downstream of Metz. The specific flow rate is very high at 35.2 litres per second per square kilometre of basin.

It is the richest Paleolithic find of the central and west Balkan Peninsula, a valuable source on the material culture and spiritual life of the Paleolithic humans. The cave is also the only Gravettian find in the west Balkans and one of the richest and most important finds of the Upper Paleolithic in the Southeast Europe. A technological and typological analysis of the discovered materials, numerous stone artifacts and fauna remnants, and the subsequent accelerator mass spectrometry method, established that the cave was already inhabited in the Middle Paleolithic, 38,000 years ago. Materials discovered in the chronologically younger layers belong to the major Upper Paleolithic cultures of Europe, Aurignacian (31,000 years ago) and Gravettian (25,000 years ago). A cave was still used for dwelling by the local population in the 4th century and then again from 12th to 15th century.

An important figure in the early Romanian labour movement, he embraced communism during World War I and organised Romanian armed detachments in Odessa in support of the October Revolution, hoping to foment a revolution in his native country. A political prisoner in Romania for much of the interwar period and during World War II, he held several minor political offices after the regime change in the late 1940s. Early life Mihail Gh. Bujor was born in Ia≈üi, the sixth children of Gheorghe Gheorghiu, a civil servant. The family was somewhat influential in the city, affording the luxury to provide adequate education for all of the twelve children. Three of children died from tuberculosis, followed shortly by the parents while Mihail was in his teen years. The quick succession of deaths is credited with transforming Mihail into an atheist. After completing a local high school, Bujor enrolled in the school of law at the University of Ia≈üi, also following the courses of several other faculties, such as literature, philosophy and natural sciences. Coming in contact with socialist ideas, he decided to join the Romanian Social Democratic Workers' Party at 16, however he was rejected on account of his young age. He would eventually be admitted at 18, shortly before the party's demise. While in university, he participated in several Marxist study circles, such as the Circle of Social Studies of the Socialists of Moldavia, organized by Max Wexler and Dr. Ghelerter, and the Circle for the Enlightenment of the Workers of Ia≈üi. Conscripted in 1901, he served in a V√¢nƒÉtori de munte battalion and was discharged in 1902 with the rank of second lieutenant. Reorganisation of the socialist movement In 1901 Mihail Gh. Bujor began to write articles for Cronica (\\"The Chronicle\\"), a Bucharest newspaper, and continued to do so until 1904. He subsequently moved to Bucharest and, starting with 1902, also became a regular contributor to Rom√¢nia Muncitoare, the main socialist press venue revived by Christian Rakovsky. Among his collaborators were socialist militants I. C. Frimu and Alecu Constantinescu. After Iosif NƒÉdejde left the newspaper for the more moderate AdevƒÉrul, Bujor took over the position of editor-in-chief. During this period he led an intense press activity towards the reorganisation of the Romanian socialist movement, coming to be recognised as one of its foremost representatives. He was especially vocal in his support of rebelling peasants during the 1907 Romanian Peasants' Revolt. Among other actions, he issued a manifesto titled CƒÉtre concentra≈£i ≈üi rezervi≈üti (\\"To the assembled and reserve soldiers\\"), calling on the army to stop firing on the rebels. As a result of his activity, Bujor was elected in the Committee of the Socialist Union during the second Conference of trade unions and socialist circles of June 1907. The other members of the Committee were Rakovsky, Frimu, N. D. Cocea and Gheorghe Cristescu. He continued to contribute to the socialist press, founding Viitorul social (\\"The social future\\"), a theoretical journal published in Ia≈üi in 1907-1908. Among the topics Bujor addressed or militated for was the replacement of the censitary suffrage used at the time in Romania with the universal suffrage. In 1910, the concentrated efforts of the members of the Socialist Union led to the organisation of a Congress for the restoration of the Social Democratic Party of Romania (PSDR). During the Congress, Bujor, who had taken an important role in its preparations, presented the new party's political platform, as well as its agrarian platform. Both documents were heavily influenced by the thinking of Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea, the main ideologue of the new party. The Congress also elected Bujor in the Executive Committee of the party. World War I and Russian Revolution After World War I started, the Romanian Social Democratic Party adopted a pacifist stance and supported the neutrality of Romania. Mihail Gh. Bujor participated in the 1914 extraordinary Congress of the PSDR and the July 1915 Bucharest Inter-Balkan Socialist Conference, which adopted strong anti-war declarations. In 1916 Romania's government decided to join the war on the side of the Entente, and PSDR was outlawed for its positions. The Romanian campaign however proved disastrous, and the southern half of the country was overrun by the forces of the Central Powers. Bujor left for Moldavia, the unoccupied part of the country, along with the government and a large part of the population. The February Revolution of 1917 led to a revival of the socialist movement in Ia≈üi, as the local socialist club was reopened and a new newspaper, Social-Democra≈£ia (\\"Social-democracy\\"), was published. There, Bujor came into contact with revolutionary elements of the Russian army stationed in Romania, and began militating for a similar evolution in Romania. Thus, in a eulogy at the funerals of former party leader Ottoi CƒÉlin on April 16, Bujor denounced war as an instrument foreign to the interests of proletariat and urged the public to extend the influence of the Russian revolution. Considering socialists a threat to its authority and the stability of the front, the Romanian government decided to clamp down on the movement by dissolving the clubs, banning their publications, and arresting their leaders, including Bujor. The imprisonment did not last long, as, after the May Day parade organised by the Russian military units in Ia≈üi, a group of Romanian socialists and workers accompanied by Russian soldiers set him free. In the same evening Bujor left for Odessa in southern Ukraine, along with Rakovsky, who had been freed in a similar manner on the same day. The local soviet of the Russian soldiers provided them with a train and an armed escort. Romanian revolutionary regiment marching in Odessa in January 1918 In Odessa, Bujor and Rakovsky organised the Romanian Committee for Social-Democratic Action, the latter leaving for Petrograd soon after. The committee, which also included socialists Ion Dic Dicescu, Alexandru Nicolau, and Alter Zalic, sought to mobilize the sizeable Romanian workers population in the region, many of them evacuated from Romania along with strategic factories in the wake of the German invasion. Bujor also maintained contact with the socialists in Ia≈üi, supplying them with printed manifestos, and in Odessa he organised a revolutionary armed battalion from local Romanian soldiers. The committee requisitioned several Romanian vessels moored in Russian Black Sea ports and rechristened them with revolutionary names. Starting with September 5, 1917, the Committee headed by Bujor also began to print the newspaper Lupta (\\"The Struggle\\"), with the help of local revolutionaries. A more radical discourse was adopted, with calls for the extension of the Russian Revolution in Romania and the overthrow of the monarchy. However, the committee supported a bourgeois-democratic revolution rather than an outright socialist one, as Romania was seen as too backward for socialism to succeed. Generally, it was supportive of the Russian Provisional Government, not making clear differences between Mensheviks and Bolsheviks. After the October Revolution, Bujor, although reserved at first, sided with the Bolsheviks, and in December he left for Petrograd to meet the new leadership. The committee also changed its position towards communist revolution in Romania, considering it as both feasible and necessary. In February 1918 Bujor met Lenin, who appointed him a member in the High College for the Struggle against Counter-revolution in the South, a provisional military command. Together with Dicescu, he edited a collection of secret documents from the Russian diplomatic archives, exposing the negotiations between Romania and Entente predating the formers entry into war, as well as later French-Russian talks dismissing Romanian territorial claims. On January 10, 1918, the Odessa committee was transformed into the Romanian National Committee against the Counter-revolution in Romania, and Bujor was soon joined by Rakovsky. The committee decided to fight against the Romanian government, whom they considered to be controlled by the bourgeoisie and the landowners, and to help start a revolution inside the country. A Soviet offensive in Romanian-controlled Bessarabia was also prepared for late February, but the evolutions on the international scene prevented a major attack. After the signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and the occupation of Ukraine by the German Army, Bujor decided to remain in Odessa. Arrested by the Germans, he was handed over to the Whites, however he was soon set free after a successful Soviet counter-offensive liberated the city. In March 1919 he was appointed to the southern bureau of the newly founded Third International, and between May and June he served as People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs in the provisional government of the short-lived Bessarabian Soviet Socialist Republic. Imprisonment and later life At the end of 1919 Mihail Gh. Bujor returned to Romania, where he militated for the transformation of Socialist Party of Romania (PSR) into a communist party. To that end, he wrote several manifestos, pamphlets and articles in the socialist press. Bujor also contributed to the documents that were to be presented in the following congress of the PSR. He would not participate in the congress, as he was arrested in March 1920 by the Romanian authorities. Bujor was sentenced to death for treason, however, following major workers' protests, the sentence was commuted to hard labour on life. Nevertheless, in the 1920 general election he won a seat for Gala≈£i in the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of the Romanian Parliament. The parliamentary majority invalidated his mandate along with the ones of several other PSR members which had won the popular vote. Bujor spent most of the interwar period imprisoned at Doftana, with long periods under solitary confinement. Following a long campaign of socialist and communist-minded intellectuals, he was eventually amnestied in 1934. Bujor attempted to use his position as an early socialist leader and former political prisoner to organise a united front of the socialist movement of Romania, at the time split between the restored Romanian Social Democratic Party (PSD), the Unitary Socialist Party (PSU), and the Peasant Workers' Bloc (BM≈¢). His initiative, although actively supported by the PSU, failed as the PSD and the communist-dominated BM≈¢ refused to negotiate with each other. As the Romanian government became increasingly authoritarian, Bujor was arrested again in 1937 and imprisoned at Jilava. During World War II, as Romania joined Nazi Germany in the invasion of the Soviet Union, he was interned along other prominent communists in the T√¢rgu Jiu camp. Set free after Romania joined the Allies, he was elected in the reformed unicameral Parliament, and, after the republic was proclaimed, he was elected to the Great National Assembly. In this period, he became a member of the Romanian Society for Friendship with the Soviet Union, and travelled to the Soviet Union, despite his disapproval of the Moscow Trials. The elder Bujor received several honorific positions after Joseph Stalin's death, such as the presidency of the Association of the Former Antifascist Political Prisoners and membership in the General Council of the International Federation of Resistance Fighters.

He may have been a successor for Usi-ana-nuri-?, the viceroy of Dilmun who was attested in the cylinder sealCylinder seal BM 122696. of his grandson, Uballissu-Marduk. Biography A tablet in poor condition,Tablet D 85, formerly designated as Ni. 2860. alleged to have been found at Larsa but provided with a Nippur-provenance designation, details the adoption contract for Ilƒ´-ippa≈°ra. His foster parent was Sin-nap≈°irra, son of Biriritum, who obtained him from Nazi-≈†iqmi, ‚Äúhis master‚Äù, an obviously Kassite name. It was witnessed by a priest (≈†ama≈°-ni≈°u), a scribe (Izkur- Marduk) and two others (Kidinu and I≈°abtum) and was dated the 19th day of ≈†abatu, the year Kurigalzu built the Ekurigibara, the Enlil temple in Nippur (ca 1380's BC). We next meet Ilƒ´-ippa≈°ra some years later, when he is stationed in Dilmun, in his correspondence with Enlil-kidinni, who was the governor, or ≈°andabakku, of Nippur, ca. 1342-1336 BC, whom he addresses as Illiliya, a familiar hypocoristicon. The Kassite administrative center was at Qal'at al-Bahrain, confirmed in 1995 by the discovery of a large cache of cuneiform tablets. Three letters have been found in Iraq, but one of these is illegible apart from the opening salutation and mention of a certain ‚Äúroyal command‚Äù. Much of the content of the other letters concerns the nefarious activities of the A·∏´lam√ª, where the term is used perhaps as ‚ÄúBedouin‚Äù might be today, as it was employed elsewhere as a synonym for 'Amurru' (MAR.TU.ME≈†), in the Middle Euphrates and in western Syria regions. Ilƒ´-ippa≈°ra does not appear to be totally in control of the events unfolding around him. He greets his brother with ‚Äúmay Inzak and Meskilak, the gods of Dilmun, guard your life‚Äù and then speaks to him of their depredations: A series of madbasa, or date presses were housed in the palace, evidence of the importance of this agricultural activity and the earliest appearance for this equipment which was later to become common on the island. He warns of travelers to Babylonia, a certain IltƒÅnu who is to leave, and [Ku]tetu who has already left, of whom he says ‚Äúfor the departure of this [woman] of his, I am not responsible.‚Äù Much of the rest of the correspondence concerns his inability to complete the repairs to the palace, or √â.GAL, or the decrepit local temple, projects which are beset by visions, possibly squatters, and other demands on his meager resources. The outcome of the dispute with the A·∏´lam√ª was apparently violent as a massive fire gutted the complex and it was abandoned, never to be rebuilt. He may be the individual who is mentioned as the father of Ninurta-bƒÅnƒ´ and Ba'il-Nab√ª who rented five slaves (Tukulti-Ninurta, Al≈°isu-ablu·π≠, Kidin-Gula, Ilan≈´tum, and their mother, Beltutum) from Enlil-Kidinni in a tabletTablet CBS 12906, published as PBS XIV no. 2, at CDLI, DINGIR-ip-pa-a≈°-ra appears on line 9. dated to the sixth reignal year of Burna-Buria≈° (ca. 1354 BC).

The son of jeweller turn banker John Kennard (Heywood, Kennards & Co, merged into Consolidated Bank Ltd), and Harriet Elizabeth Peirse, he trained as a merchant in London. Having invested in the Falkirk Iron Co in 1830, Kennard's consortia formed the Blaenavon Coal and Iron Company in 1836, which subsequently bought the Blaenavon Ironworks. There he employed his son, the noted civil engineer Thomas Kennard, and his cousin and the later photographer George Swan Nottage. Through his connections with the iron and steel industries, and access to large sums of money through his families banking connections, he became a significant financier during the railway boom of the 1830s, and also financed some of the government requirements during the Crimea War. Leveraging this, Kennard made his fortune as a director of several UK railway companies, and as a director of one of the largest groups promoting railroads in France and Belgium. He held the office of Justice of the Peace for: Stirlingshire; Middlesex; and later Hertfordshire. Having held the office of Deputy Lieutenant of Monmouthshire, he was appointed Sheriff of London and Middlesex between 1846 and 1847. He was elected as an associate member of the Institution of Civil Engineers, seconded by Robert Stephenson and Sir William Cubitt. He was decorated with the award of Chevalier, Order of Leopold of Belgium. Kennard was elected to the House of Commons as a Conservative on 11 February 1857, representing Newport (Isle of Wight) constituency. He was not reelected in the general election in March that year, but returned to Parliament in the 1859 general election, and sat until he stepped down at the 1868 general election. Kennard married Mary Ann Challis, only child of Liberal MP and later Lord Mayor of London Thomas Challis, on 23 May 1823. Living in Theobalds Park, Hertfordshire, the couple had 10 children: Mary Jane Kennard; Charlotte Anne Kennard (died 24 Oct 1926); Ellen Kennard (died 5 Apr 1917); Reverend Robert Bruce Kennard (8 May 1824 ‚Äì 10 Mar 1895); Thomas William Kennard (29 Aug 1825 ‚Äì 10 Sep 1893); Arthur Challis Kennard (born 17 Jun 1831); Henry Martyn Kennard (born 17 Feb 1833); John Kennard (13 Apr 1836 ‚Äì 24 Nov 1925); Howard John Kennard (29 Nov 1839 ‚Äì 8 Aug 1896); Edward Kennard (born 22 Apr 1842).

Denis, dated from several inscriptions and commemorative plaques located within the fortress. The first dates to 6 February 1294Barroca (2000), vol. 2, t.1, p.1108-1113 and is situated over the gates of the fortress. These plaques indicate that the project promoter was the Master of the Order of Avis, then D. Jo√£o Afonso, who was responsible for placing the first stone on that date. The second plaque recalls the placing of the first cornerstone in 1294, by Louren√ßo Afonso, 9th Master of the Order of Avis, their founder, located in the western part of the keep tower.Barroca (2000), vol. 2, t.1, p.1140-1144 The construction of the fortification continued until 1298 and were attributed to a Moor, named Galvao, illustrating a distinction between Moorish adversaries of the time and common workers.Barroca (2000), vol. 2, t.1, p. 1114-1118 Between 1383 and 1385, Pedro Rodrigues, was the alcalde of the fortress. Yet, in the following years, Alandroal played little role in the organization of the military lines of the region, and it quickly began to decline. By 1606, the interior of the castle, including the residential spaces were already in a considerable state of ruin. But, in 1774, the construction of the clock tower had already preceded indicating a level of recuperation at the site. The barbican was destroyed in 1778 and materials from the site were used in the construction of the new municipal buildings. Between 1786 and 1793, the comarca's jail was constructed, resulting in the eventual demolition of the tower and primitive belfry (where the clock was installed). The DGEMN undertook significant rebuilding and restoration on site between 1943 and 1946, as well as 1958, to restore the military square and several of the fortified wall. This included the restoration of the keep tower and demolition of some homes in order to open-up the castle spaces. The staircases along the battlements were regularized and stabilized, with reconstruction occurring on many of the rises. Modern projects in 1980 and 1986 also attempted to stabilize the foundation and clear plant infestants that covered the site, in addition to masonry repairs to improve water flow along the walls, merlons and tower near the Church of the Miseric√≥rdia. The decaying structure was placed under the stewardship of the Instituto Portugu√™s do Patrim√≥nio Arquitet√≥nico (IPPR) on 1 June 1992 (Decree 106F/92, Di√°rio da Rep√∫blica, S√©rie 1A, 126). Architecture The castle is situated on the most elevated point of the town of Alandroal. Dating back to the 13th century, this medieval fortress is typical of the Gothic fortifications of the period based on an oval design, with keep addorsed to a circuit of walls and gate (designated the Legal Gate), protected by two rectangular towers, slightly advanced to allow protection at the entranceway. Originally, the castle included a small quarter within its walls divided by a singular roadway (the Rua do Castelo) oriented west to east and flanked by two gates (the aforementioned Legal Gate and the Arrabalde Gate). The keep tower is a rectangular structure divided into three floors, whose interior access has been sealed. This doorway provided access (sometime later in its history) to the matriarchial church at the location (sometime in the 18th century). At the top of the keep tower, a clocktower was implanted, that included three bronze bells. The military square has two lateral staircases that lead to the battlements. The traitor's gate (today obstructed) crosses the Cadeia forte (Jail Fort), named for the addorsed western structure used as the jailhouse for regional comarca (a rectangular tower with grated and gross windows). The tower of this forte has a rectangular plan and rectangular dependency with stone balcony (to the west) with arch and sculpted capitals.

The castle was likely constructed in the 12th century, that succeeded various older fortifications. The castle had 20 towers of more than and a large keep tower, two gates along the north (including the Porta Nova in the north and the Porto de Ferro in the east).Cardoso (1767)Leal (1880) Archeological excavations occurring in the 20th century, proved that Alc√°cer do Sal was constructed during the Almohad Caliphate, during a period of Moorish occupation in the Iberian peninsula. It was conquered in 1158 by D. Afonso Henriques, but was retaken in 1191 by the Arab Moors, as evidenced by the construction of the pentagonal tower during its occupation.Correia (1971) It was definitively reconquered in 1217, by King D. Afonso II, who donated it to the Order of Santiago. This military religious order remained seated in Alc√°cer do Sal until its move to M√©rtola. Beginning in 1289, the castle and fortifications were rebuilt. In 1570, Rui de Salema and his wife, D. Catarina de Souto Maior, founded the Convent of Nossa Senhora de Aracaeli, to house/shelter the sisters of Poor Clares/Order of Saint Claire. The nuns were housed in the interior of the castle in the old residences of the former Commandery of the Order of Santiago and Royal Palace. Following an earthquake in 1969, the site was damaged. The unstable accessways along the walls were reinforced in 1971, along with repaving the foundations, filling of cracks along the parapets and the masonry (to imitate the taipa removed from the site). This was extended in 1975 to include work along the western wall of the clocktower. Between 1982 and 1983, the restoration of the adarves and battlements were undertaken, and continue the restoration of the walls and turrets. This turret was immediately reconstructed in 1985 in stone masonry, with imitation taipa. In successive years (1986, 1987 and 1988) there were recovery works: reconstruction, improvement and consolidation of the walls and turrets. In the 1990s, work on re-covering the site and restoring the castle for use as a hostel began at this time, but was interrupted due to the discovery of an ancient Roman forum site. As a consequence, the property was taken over by the IPPAR Instituto Portugu√™s do Patrim√≥nio Arquitet√≥nico (Portuguese Institute of Architectural Patrimony) by decree on 1 June 1992, (Decree 106F/92, Di√°rio da Rep√∫blica, S√©rie 1A, 126). Nonetheless, on 16 May 1998, the hostel was inaugurated. A public tender was issued in 2000, to award a contract to secure and reinforce the hilltop (Di√°rio da Rep√∫blica, S√©rie III, 215, 16 September). At the same time, work began on setting-up the Special Protection Zone (ZPE), by the municipal authority of Alc√°cer do Sal (September 2003), supplemented by a similar act on 16 May 2005. On 7 April 2009, there was a proposal made by the DRCAlentejo; as a consequence, the director of IGESPAR issued a dispatch to DRCAlentejo to reanalyze the proposal for the ZPE. This move resulted in a new proposal for the ZPE on 25 October 2010 by DRCAlentejo. On 15 December, SPAA National Council for Culture agreed with the proposal defined by the new ZPE. Over time, though, the ZPE's limits was expanded on 7 December 2012 (Di√°rio da Rep√∫blica, S√©rie 2, 237, announcement 13758/2012). The first major work on the site occurred along the south wall in 1958: the masonry and taipa was demolished (those areas in ruin). The masonry was reconstructed until the foundations and support taipa, in the areas around site. The walls to the north were consolidate in 1963, resulting in the demolition in the wall area, that involved re-pavement and repair of the parapets, using stone from the site. Similar work on the western walls were undertaken in 1966, along with repair of the roof and other elements of the walls, that continued to 1967 along the south wall. Between 1969 and 1970, portions of the church were re-roofed, along with the structure's base in reinforced concrete, the internal walls and sections of the cloister, in addition to conservation of the walls near the church.  Architecture  A view of the modern encroaching on the ancient: the cloister of the castle The Romanticised interiors of the Pousada (hostel) The castle is located on a hilltop on the edge of the rural area of Alc√°car do Sal, isolated over the town, river and adjacent terrains. Within the courtyard of the castle is the Church of Santa Maria do Castelo. The irregular plan includes two lines of differentiated walls, intermixed with towers located at irregular intervals. The walls spread over the cliffs, to the north and south. The north walls and towers, with adarve encircling it, are decorated by rectangular merlons. In the northeast, at the extreme circuit, is the Tower of Algipe, with a square base transformed into octagonal by four triangular slopes. In the extreme northwest are two taller towers that flank a line of walls broken by vaulted arch and surmounted by smaller central arches. In the south are the remains of another wall and part of the towers, with a southwestern tower with clock tower. Within the walls along the northwest wall, as the ruins of the Convent of Nossa Senhora da Aracaeli, that are connect by archways and flanked by towers. The church, with double choir is a unique, rectangular nave without roof, and rectangular presbytery decorated with pinnacles. To the north, alongside the cloister centred on a two-storey wings, encircled by rounded arches over pilasters, with upper-story framed windows. The convent and church open to the castle courtyard.

Military career Szombathelyi joined the Austro-Hungarian army as a cadet in 1902 and was subsequently promoted to lieutenant in 1907 in the 16th Infantry Regiment. From 1911, he studied at the Kriegsschule (military academy) in Vienna. After participating in World War I he joined the newly founded Royal Hungarian Army. From 1926 he taught at the Ludovica Military Academy in Budapest. From 1931-33, he was Chief of Staff of the 3rd Mixed Brigade, after which he served as adjutant of the high command of the armed forces in 1935‚Äì36. In 1938, he became the commander of the Ludovica Military Academy. From 1934 onward, he used his mother's maiden surname rather than his own given surname. In 1938‚Äì39 he held the post of Deputy Chief of Staff. From 1939-41, he commanded the VIII Corps before he was appointed commanding general of the \\"Carpathian group\\" (K√°rp√°t Csoport), with which he took part in Operation Barbarossa. On 6 September, he was appointed by Regent Mikl√≥s Horthy to succeed the pro-German Henrik Werth as Chief of General Staff. Szombathelyi assessed the prospects of war with the Soviet Union sceptically and did not hesitate to share this view with his German counterpart. Shortly after his appointment he was present at a meeting between Hitler and Horthy when the latter promised to provide more troops. He successfully delayed this measure until it could no longer be avoided following German Army setbacks in the winter of 1941-42 and the increased commitment of Romania. In April 1942, he sent the Second Army of Guszt√°v J√°ny to the Eastern Front. Previously, in response to alleged attacks by communist partisans and Chetniks in the annexed B√°cska, he ordered a military intervention by General Ferenc Feketehalmy-Czeydner, which evolved into punitive action against Serb-inhabited villages and culminated in the massacre of √öjvid√©k (present-day Novi Sad). In response to the catastrophic defeats of the second Army in the winter of 1942-43, Hungary increasingly tried to distance itself from its Axis partners. Szombathelyi's proposal to use Hungarian divisions to occupy the Balkans as a substitute for the failure of the second Army was welcomed by Hitler but rejected by Prime Minister Mikl√≥s K√°llay. Contacts with the Western powers were initiated, with K√°llay and Szombathelyi playing leading roles. After the German invasion of Hungary in March 1944, Szombathelyi was removed from office and placed under house arrest at German insistence, and retired in April. He was arrested in October 1944 after the Arrow Cross Party assumed power. Szombathelyi was deported to Germany toward the end of the war, then taken into custody by the Americans, who, however, turned him over to Hungary shortly thereafter. He was convicted by the Hungarian people's court to life imprisonment, then extradited to Yugoslavia. On 4 November 1946, in Petrovaradin (Hungarian: P√©terv√°rad), Vojvodina, Szombathelyi was executed by a firing squad.

History Just from Portalegre, the castle of Alegrete is one of the more important fortress in the Alto Alentejo, assuming since the Middle Age, a fundamental position in regional defense. Most of the references to its origins are obscure. Traditional literature suggest that its history extends to the primordials of the Portuguese kingdom. Legend suggests that Alegrete was reconquered from the Moors in 1160 by D. Afonso Henriques. The first documents suggest it dated from the 13th century, during the reign of King D. Afonso III, when the fortifications were either constructed or reconstructed. On 16 February 1267, the settlement was effectively incorporated into the possessions of the Portuguese Crown, in the Treaty of Badajoz, celebrated between King D. Afonso III and his father-in-law King D. Alfonso X of Castile. The reconstruction of the fortifications are attributed to the foral (charter) of King D. Dinis in 1319. Most of the building on the site occurred between the 13th and 14th century, but likely began immediately after the accord at Badajoz. The perimeter of the fortification was quite irregular, and did not adopt the oval plan generally used during the Portuguese Gothic period. The keep tower was erected alongside the eastern walls and located near a cistern, that supported the community within the walls and military garrison. The main gateway was in the south (today concealed) and crowned by small tower with machicolations towards the interior. Complimenting the military garrison was a curtain of walls connected to the castle. In the following centuries, Alegrete took on an important role in the wars with Castile. On 8 April 1384, D. Nuno Alvares Pereira visited Alegrete as part of his defense of Portugal. A new foral was issued on 14 February 1516 by King D. Manuel I. The transition between medieval warfare and pyroballistic warfare determined the slow decline of the castle. Meanwhile, though, the dynastic crisis resulting from the death of King Sebastian at Alc√°cer Quibir, revitalized the importance of the medieval castle, owing to its frontier position along the Spanish border. Under the influence of the Marquess of Marialva, the walls were repaired and updated, during a rapid reconstruction process. The work resulted in a fortress with bastions, but little today remains to identify its limits. At the end of the 17th century, King D. John IV compensated General Matias de Albuquerque by making him the Count of Alegrete, and putting the castle on the first line of defense during the Portuguese Restoration War. By 1662, the garrison of Alegrete was composed of two infantry companies, under the command of La Cost√©. As legend suggests, the Governor dissuaded John of Austria (whose forces had encircled the settlement) from attacking, offering him two bottles of wine and suggesting that the Portuguese garrison would resist until the last of the wine produced in Alegrete. Work on the walls were carried out by Lu√≠s Serr√£o Pimentel following their damage. On 12 July 1664, there is record of repairs and rehabilitation of the fortifications under the direction of the Marquess of Marialva. On 19 August 1687, the Marquess of Alegrete was instituted, in the name of its first Marquess, D. Manuel Teles da Silva. In 1704, Portuguese forces situated in Alegrete resisted the siege by Phillip V of Spain. During the course of the War of the Oranges at the beginning of the Peninsular Wars, forces stationed in Alegrete resisted Spanish bombardment in 1801. But, the castle was already irreversibly in decline. Within twenty years, the conflict between Absolutists and Liberals erupted within Portugal, leading to combat within the castle's proximity, between troops of the Count of Vila Flor and royalist forces. As part of political reforms the municipality and magisterial courts in Alegrete were extinguished on 26 June 1855. Architecture The ruined tower and fortifications along the southern line of defenses The urban fortifications, with castle to the south, delimits the primitive settlement on top of the mountain, at about altitude. On the northern flank supported the town, called the Arrabalde, and rest of the flanks are occupied by agricultural fields, with olive orchards, broken by the Ribeira de S√£o Pedro (also called Ribeira do Ninho d'A√ßor) in the west. The location of the fortifications, at the top of the mountain, makes it an ideal lookout over the vast landscape below. Much of the walls are in a state of ruin; yet, there are several trenches still conserved, including the \\"Vila\\" Gate, a prototype of typical Gothic gates. The castle comprises an irregular plan, delimited by the \\"Vila\\" Gate in the north and along the east the \\"Traitors'\\" Gate (also called the \\"Sun\\" Gate). At this point there are ruins in east that could have been the keep tower, with cistern and pavement with door to the south. Over the cistern is another pavement above the stairs the extend from the patio. The tower appears to have been divided in two from the cistern. To the west of the tower is a small tower and terrace that opens to a patio. In the south/southwest of the castle are the remains of a cubel/watchtower, with a rectangular surface, that accessible from a staircase addorsed from the southern wall. Much of the interior of the castle is occupied by rocks and unlevel ground. The urban walls, extend from the cardinal directions from the castle: two walls to the southwest (extending from the \\"Santana\\" Gate); west from a cubel, that continues to the north; the wall, then, inflects towards the east-southeast (at the Rua do Forno Gate); connects to the \\"Villa\\" Gate between two corbels, continues along to the a cubel in the east (with only minor interruption); before inflecting to the south, connecting the castle and terminating in the southwest.

It was constructed in this region due to its significant strategic importance, due to its close proximity to the border between Portugal and Spain. It is classified as a National Monument.  History  Portuguese settlements in the north were conveniently constructed on hilltops, providing protection to local populations from raids. During the Roman Iberian invasion/occupation many of these settlements were converted into fortified villages, due to their strategic positions. The first defensive structures were believed to be constructed by these colonists, who worked in the older castros into their fortifications. Roman occupation of the territory was followed by successive waves of Suevi and the Visigoths who repurposed the structures. Muslim settlers, later known as Moors, occupied the settlements during the Taifa of Badajoz. The lands of Almeida were conquered from these Moors in 1039, by Ferdinand I of Le√≥n and Castile, but remained contentious between 1156 and 1190, when they alternated between Le√≥n, Moors and Portucalense forces. In 1190, the territory was reconquered from the Moors by Pio Guterres, named the Almeid√£o, effectively ending Moorish dominance in the region and inspiring the name for the village. From here the lands alternated between Leonese and Portuguese, and by 1217 Almeida was recorded as a Leonese village, part of a group of settlements that protected the C√¥a valley. =Medieval= Book of Fortresses, compiled by Duarte D'Armas in 1510 By 1217, documents show that the castle at Almeida is one of several strong points that guard the border between Spain and Portugal. On 8 November 1296, King D. Dinis issued a foral (charter) to Almeida, ordering the re- construction of a castle and walls. This structure was expanded in 1369 by order of D. Ferdinand. In 1372, Isabella the illegitimate daughter of Ferdinand I, married Alfonso, Count of Gij√≥n and Noro√±a, who was the illegitimate son of King Henrique II of Castile. This marriage was one of the clauses of the peace treaty signed between Portugal and Castile in 1373, along with the castle and lands of Almeida been ceded to Castile for three years. In 1383, during the Succession Crisis, the castle's alcalde swore fealty to D. Beatriz, and aligned himself with Castile, resulting in the 1386 conquest of Almeida by King D. John I, through the assistance of Portuguese nobles in Castile, securing the Portuguese throne. The village began to pertain to the Crown of Portugal in 1407, with the exchange of lands arranged between King John and the alcalde. King D. Afonso V donated Almeida to D. Pedro de Menezes. During the reign of King Manuel I the strengthening and enlargement of the castle's walls and fortifications were ordered. The works were carried out under the instruction of the architect Mateus Fernandes and were completed in 1508. In a letter dated 9 September 1508, King Manuel gave instructions to stonemason √Ålvaro Pires to examine the works, to which he assigned Francsico de Anzinho master of works, to undertake the task for 1$550. On 27 October, D. Manuel ordered payment of mason Martim Louren√ßo for his work in Almeida, to \\"look at the work that was completed by Francisco de Anzinho\\". Almeida Castle was included in a set of manuscripts formed into a book which contained drawings of all 56 castles located on the border between Portugal and Spain. The book, called the Book of Fortresses, had been ordered compiled by King Manuel I, was completed between 1509 and 1510. The author was Duarte D'Armas, a squire of the Royal Household and a bachelor of canon law and apostolic notary, who held the office of Registrar of the Royal Library and Torre do Tombo. He personally visited each castle and fortress for the purpose. There are two drawings of the castle at Almeida Castle in the book; a northern elevation and a southern elevation with both castle drawings bearing the personal standard of King Manuel I, who issued a new foral in 1510. =Restoration Wars= A plan of the castle/fortress of Almeida From 1517, buildings in the town were demolished for the fortress project. In addition, a tax of $100 was levied on each person for the project, which included walls and garrison. But, between 1580 and 1640, the defensive structures began to decay and fall into ruin. Following John IV of Portugal's restoration of the Crown of Portugal, on 1 December 1640, the monarch sought to consolidate and strengthen his throne, making decisions to strengthen his military control of the territory. He created a Council of War to organize the Kingdom's security along with a Junta of the Frontiers. This Junta had the responsibility of reviewing and strengthening the existing fortresses near the border. One of the Junta's projects was the construction of a new defensive structure at Almeida. Following 1640, the first Military Governor for Beira was established, D. √Ålvaro de Abranches da C√¢mara, who ordered the construction of modern fortifications, \\"with four or five redoubts, placing within it a Church and the Castle\\". This project was undertaken by Jo√£o Saldanha e Sousa, and was in rudimentary progress by January 1641. This first fortification consisted of trenches. By November the Provincial Governor was established in Almeida, who transformed the installation into a military square. This became the fortress that stands on the site today, surrounding the previous medieval castle. Completed in 1641, it was 12 pointed-star shaped. Responsibility for the project was by the architect David √Ålvares. The fortress was built in a Vaubanesque style, to which the French military engineer is believed to have personally been involved during end of its construction. Between 1641 and 1643, architect √Ålvares was the superintendent on site, \\"administrating the representatives, masons and more workers and assisting personally in the work at the fortifications\\".ALVES, p. 64 As he did not receive a wage for his work, he requested and received an exemption to the tithe. In 1642, Fern√£o Teles de Menezes decided to build a trench of stone and clay. King D. John IV ordered his royal engineer, Carlos Lassart, to design and reconnoitre the fortifications in the Entre Douro, Minho and Beira regions. Fern√£o Teles Cot√£o became responsible for the project between 1642 and 1646. On 28 February 1643, a royal dispatch ordered Carlos Lassart to, as each fortification was being expanded, leave an official oriented to continue the project. Sometime around this time, French engineer Pierre Gilles de Saint Paul began serving the Crown within the Beira province, possibly directing some of the work in Almeida. By 1644, the fortress was described as having an open curtin of walls. As Jo√£o Salgado de Ara√∫jo, indicated the execution of the Royal fortifications included an imposing structure of seven redoubts. On 25 February 1645, the Military Governor for Beira was D. Fernando de Mascaranhas, Count of Ser√©m, who immediately ordered that the square be reduced in size. In that year, Spanish forces attempted to attack the town, without success. In 1646, Pierre Girles was substituted in the public works by lieutenant-general Rodrigo Soares Pantoja, and the Governor of the Province immediately ordered the dimensions of the square be reduced. Yet, the following year, work on the fortress was expanded by sergeant-major Agostinho de Andrade Freire. Similarly, in 1657, D. Rodrigo de Castro, Governor of Almeida, increased work on the fortification, ordering large changes its profile and organization. Sometime during the 17th century, the castle began being used to store gunpowder. In 1661, from the writings of the Count of Mesquitela, the square was not yet totally encircled, and was accessible from the town at various places and had no moat. On 2 July 1663, Spanish forces attacked the fort, but were repelled, but there were constant fears of Spanish invasion. On 11 September 1663 the Province of Beira was divided into two regions, due to its large frontier. The region of Almeida came under the control of Pedro Jacques e Magalh√£es, Master of the General Camp of the province, who established his post in the town. In order to safeguard his new post, in 1665, the public works on the fortress were adjudicated to businessmen Ant√≥nio Francisco Maio and Domingos Vaz Heredes, but were later (16679 conceded to Jo√£o Gon√ßalves and Manuel Fernandes, without discord. On 13 February 1668, Portugal and Spain signed a peace treaty, temporarily ending conflict between the two Iberian neighbours. The lull in hostilities did not dissuade Portuguese forces who vigorously continued work on the fortress, beginning with the left lateral walls near the Santo Ant√≥nio Gate. In 1676, the magistral gate of Santo Ant√≥nio and transition space to the ravelin of Cruz were begun. The Chapel of Vera Cruz was demolished in 1680, in order for the fortifications walls to be extended. Meanwhile, in 1695, there was an explosion in the castle, causing the death of 40 people and a large damage to the residences and fortifications nearby. This damage caused a change in the configuration of the castle. Between 1702 and 1714, during the War of Spanish Succession, Almeida began to serve as a garrison for troops, and base of operations for forces in Beira. In May 1704, Portugal was invaded by Spanish troops. Conflict between the two states would continue until February 1715, when a peace treaty was signed. In 1736, an explosion occurred in the warehouse of the bastion of S√£o Pedro, at the same time that double ravelin was added to the fortress. Between 1737 and 1738, work at the site was directed by the Royal engineer Manuel de Azevedo Fortes, assisted by engineers Pinto de Alpoim and Jacinto Lopes da Costa. Manuel de Azevedo Fortes proposed the construction of: mounted horseman over the bastion of S√£o Jo√£o de Deus; a kitchen in front of the ravelin dos Amores; \\"tenalham\\" in front of the walls between the bastions of S√£o Pedro and Santo Ant√≥nio; vaults for defense of the moats, in front of all the walls, except in the rear and gates; a powder magazine alongside the castle; two bomb-proof barracks under the bulwarks of S√£o Francisco and Santa B√°rbara; the division of the ravelin de Santo Ant√≥nio into two separate corpos per moat and with gate to the east; and openings for posterns in the bastions of S√£o Pedro, S√£o Francisco and walls between the bastions of S√£o Jo√£o de Deus and Santa B√°rbara. A majority of the proposed projects were not executed, and only the gates of S√£o Francisco and some ravelins were begun. Between 1746 and 1747, lands was expropriated for execution of the fortress. On 1 November 1755, the famous Lisbon earthquake caused damage to the walls and destruction of the infantry barracks. by March 1762, the fortress had largely attained its current dimensions and profile, even as the ravelins were not concluded, nor the esplanade and battlements. At this time the works were under the direction of Jo√£o Alexandre de Charmont, along with engineers Jo√£o Victoire Aliron de Sabione, Lu√≠s de Alincourt, Vasco Jos√© Charpententier, Pedro Vicente Vidal and Ant√≥nio Carlos Andreis. Work had begun on the kitchen in front of the ravelin of Santa B√°rbara; correction of the parapets were undertaken, owing to their sub-dimension, eliminating the road the circled it; construction of lateral paths in the walls between the bastions of S√£o Jo√£o de Deus and Santa B√°rbara, and the bulwarks of S√£o Pedro and Santo Ant√≥nio; substitution of stone in the battlements and partial reconstruction of the covering. Charmont left with his success, Ant√≥nio Carlos Andreis, a long list of works to be executed. A few of the request projects were considered inconvenient to the military engineers, and were changed. =Seven Years' War= As part of the circumstances of the Seven Years' War, on 18 May 1762, Portugal declared war on France and Spain. By June, work on covering the casemates in the bastion of S√£o Jo√£o de Deus were progressing, although Francisco Maclean has suggested making them bomb- proof. On 15 June, Spain declared war on Portugal and concentrated a large number of Spanish and French along the frontiers of Beira. Meanwhile, work on the fortress continued, with the construction of platforms in wood and the opening of canon emplacements in the bastions. The excessive number of canons emplacements executed put in cause the defenses' resistance, and many had to be closed. Then, the fortress was besieged by Spanish forces for nine days between 16 and the 25 August 1762. Known later as the Siege of Almeida, Spanish forces under the command of Count of Aranda lead a major offensive to take control of Portugal. The northern pincer of this force crossed the border into Portugal from Galicia, while the southern arm crossed the frontier from Ciudad Rodrigo and was soon outside Almeida. On the 25 August, Portuguese forces capitulated to the Spanish and advanced west towards Porto. This advance towards Porto was stalled due to the influx of 8,000 British troops and the Battle of Valencia de Alc√°ntara, events which interfered with Spanish resources and supply lines. The Almeida fortress was garrisoned by the Spanish and held, despite the set-backs. Almeida remained the only major fortress still held by Spain by the end of the war. On 3 November 1762, the peace treaty of Fontainebleau was signed, leading to the 10 February 1763 Treaty of Paris, ending the Seven Years' War. As part of the treaty, on 11 April 1763 Almeida was devolved to Portugal, when Field Marshall Francisco Maclean accepted Spanish surrender, in exchange for the return of Cuba and the Philippines to Spain, which had previously been in the hands of the British. On 9 May 1764, the Count of Lippe reexamined the batteries, and Miguel Lu√≠s Jacob surveyed the state of the military square, along with their adjuncts, Francisco Jo√£o Roscio and Francisco Gomes de Lima. On 30 January 1766, Maclean obtained regal authorization to proceed with work at the site, that included latrines for soldiers. A \\"General Plan for Additional Necessary Works for the Defense of the City of Almeida\\" was elaborated by Colonel Almeida Jacques Funck. Miguel Lu√≠s Jacob became director for the public works. While insisting that most of the work was necessary, little was executed. But, on 1766, a gunpowder magazine was constructed at the bastion of S√£o Pedro, substituting the one that existed on the embankment, along with a similar one at the ravelin of Santa B√°rbara. In 1773, the Field Marshall was substituted for Fernando da Costa Ata√≠de Theive. On 9 March 1770, \\"Extracto de apontamentos sobre o estado atual desta fortifica√ß√£o, dos Reparos e Obras novas de q. Necessita...\\" (Extract of notes on the actual state of these fortifications, its Artillery and new public works that are Needed...) by engineer Anast√°cio Ant√≥nio de Sousa Miranda, which proposed several projects until 1810. The work would be under the direction of Matias Jos√© Dias Azedo, assisted by Joaquim Pedro Pinto de Sousa and Jos√© Feliciano de Gouveia. On 21 November 1796, they solicited the construction of a battery where the enemy had constructed a temporary installation. =Peninsular Wars= In 1800, First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte and his ally, the Spanish prime-minister Manuel de Godoy sent an ultimatum to Portugal demanding that they should close their shipping to their old ally England (in the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1373), and to enter into an alliance with France. The Portuguese refused and on 28 February 1801, France declared war on Portugal, followed on 2 March by Spanish declarations to support its alliance with France: instituting the War of the Oranges. The defense of Beira was left to the Marquess of Alorna, and the fortress was under the command of Field Marshall Gustavo Adolfo H√©rcules de Chermont, who accelerated the execution of complimentary plan presented in 1795 and 1796, and expressed the urgency of erecting an embankment over the bastion of S√£o Jo√£o de Deus. Spain invaded from the Alentejo and over the following months entered into a stalemate with Portuguese forces at Elvas, Campo Maior, Oliven√ßa and Juromenha. On 6 June 1801 Portugal entered into a formal peace treaty with Spain on the tenets of the Treaty of Badajoz, which was formalized with France on 29 September. But, with Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, Portugal restored relations with its old ally. In December 1806, Napoleon decreed the Continental Blockade, imposing on Europe the forced closing of ports to English ships, which Portugal did not accept. Napoleon, therefore, ordered the invasion of Portugal. On 20 November 1807, the first invasion commanded by Jean-Andoche Junot began, resulting in the 13 January 1808 taking of the fortress, without resistance. The French left in August, and the Portuguese named Colonel Francisco Bernardo da Costa as the Governor of Almeida. Following Napoleon's brutal repression of the Spanish Dos de Mayo Uprising in Madrid, the Emperor triggered the Peninsular War by ordering a force of 4,000 troops with sixteen cannon across the border to occupy the fortress of Almeida, which despite early French invasion of the country, was still in the hands of the Portuguese. From the fortress, Napoleon ordered that his general Junot should closely observe the cities of Valladolid, Salamanca and Ciudad Rodrigo. On the 24 May 1808 the first body of troops under the command of General Louis-Henri Loison marched on to Almedia arriving and occupying the fortress on the 5 June. In February 1809, the second French invasion began under the command of Soult, but never reached Almeida. Then on 15 August 1810, Andr√© Massena began the third intervention, bombarding the fortress, under the command of British Brigadier General William Cox. On 26 August, a shell made a chance hit on the medieval castle within the fortress, which was being used as the powder magazine. It ignited 4,000 prepared charges, which in turn ignited of black powder and 1,000,000 musket cartridges. The ensuing explosion killed 600 defenders and wounded 300. The medieval castle was razed to the ground and sections of the defences were damaged. Unable to reply to the French cannonade without gunpowder, Cox was forced to capitulate the following day with the survivors of the blast and 100 cannon. The French losses during the operation were 58 killed and 320 wounded. Massena left the fortress in the hands of General Brenier. On 7 April 1811, Wellington planned the retaking of Almeida. On 7 May, Massena ordered the destruction of the fortress, so that Anglo- Portuguese forces could not use it in the future. With that, on 10 May, as French abandon the installation through the bastion of S√£o Jo√£o de Deus, they caused the destruction of the artillery within the fortress. Almeida, therefore, was retaken by troops of the Alliance and held provisionally. On 7 June 1813, Colonel Pedro Folque worked on a project for the revitalizing the fortress. Within the year, the war with France was over. William Carr Beresford proposed to the Minister of War that the fortress should be dismantled and that the artillery should be removed. On 3 March 1817, Beresford ordered that work on the fort should cease and that the fortification should be mined, which began in October, against the wishes of the Governor of Almeida. In 1819, the Governor ordered the square be buried, and that the castle be transformed into a parkway or promenade. These changes made the fortress a campaign fort, providing monumental defensive functions, in times of crisis. =Liberal Wars= In 1828, the municipal authority sided with King D. Miguel, but the military garrison at fortress remains loyal to King D. Pedro. By June, Miguelist/absolutist forces had the fortress encircled, leading to their surrender by 16 July. Miguelist troops then remained at Almeida until 18 April 1834, when they were evacuated. On 22 April, a Quadruple Alliance was signed between Liberal forces of England, France, Spain and Portugal, that required their intervention in the defence of Liberal parliamentary institutions. These events, ultimately, lead to the 26 May signing of the peace treaty at Evoramonte, forcing D. Miguel into exile, and beginning a period of free Liberal thinking in Portugal. Quickly, though, factionalism between Devourists, Chartists and Setembrists developed into a series of episodes that enriched internal politics, leading to internal strife and civil war. On 29 June 1847, the Convention of Gramido put an end to the civil war, not before the fortress was taken by revolutionary forces in 1844 interested in reinstating the 1822 Constitution. In 1853, Marshall Duke of Saldanha, commander of the Portuguese army, named a commission to examine the fortifications at Almeida and decide its military future. The commission took another year to visit the square, which they saw as one of the strongest of the Kingdom, and suggestion it should be repaired. Many of the required alterations and repairs were documented. On 27 August 1887, the fortress of Almeida returns to its classification as a first-class fortification, and on 7 January 1888, a new military Governor is appointed. This \\"golden era\\" would be short-lived: in September 1893, after public review, the fortress was partially destroyed, during the course of improving the accessibility and converting it from a defense fortification. In 1894 the majority of artillery pieces were removed, leading to the 28 June 1895 declassification of the square by the Comiss√£o Superior de Guerra (Superior Commission for War). =20th century= At the beginning of the 20th century, connections were made between the ravelin and magistral gate of Cruz. In October 1926, a cavalry contingent with its headquarters in Aveiro departed for Almeida. The Ministry of War obliged the squadron to return to their barracks, on 26 January 1927, but they only departed on 19 February 1927. Starting in 1980, the fortress began to take on a socio-cultural and historical function, with the installation of multiple exhibitions and centres for investigation. In that year, a military museum was inaugurated in the Gate of Cruz. A tourism post was inaugurated in the magistral gate in 1992. As well, the fortress was placed in charge of the Instituto Portugu√™s do Patrim√≥nio Arquitet√≥nico (Portuguese Institute of Architectural Patrimony) by decree 106F/92 (Di√°rio da Rep√∫blica, S√©rie 1A), in the same year, resulting in a permanent exhibition dedicated to the 23rd Infantry Regiment, along with activity space for scouts and multi-use halls in the guardhouse of the Santo Ant√≥nio Gate was installed in 1996. Ultimately, on 25 August 2002, the Centro de Estudos de Arquitectura Militar (Centre for Studies into Military Architecture) was implanted in the ravelin of Santo Ant√≥nio. On 20 December 2007, the property became the responsibility of the Dire√ß√£o Regional da Cultura do Centro (Centro Region Directorate for Culture), under auspices of the dispatch 1130/2007 (Di√°rio da Rep√∫blica, S√©rie 2, 245). Architecture The castle is situated in an isolated urban context, implanted on the western limits from the Castela-Le√£o plateau, over the valley of the River C√¥a. The modern fortification encompasses the older part of the village, covered in vegetation and only open along the military square, while the small bastion of Cruz is punctuated with trees. Alongside the Cruz gate, is the infantry barracks of Terreiro das Freiras and, immediately nearby, the Church and Hospital of the Miseric√≥rdia of Almeida. Near the bastion of S√£o Jo√£o de Deus is the Pousada de Nossa Senhora das Neves and on the embankment of the bastion, the old Trem de Artilharia or Picadeiro Real. On the extreme west of the village centre, at an elevated height, are the foundations of the castle, where a platform has been erected for tourists to view the site. Between the bastion of S√£o Jo√£o de Deus is a posterm or false gate, that accesses greenspace flanked by military square. The fortress seen today is arranged on an irregular hexagonal plan and consists of six polygon, irregular and uneven sized bastions which are connected by curtain walls and forming a perimeter of and forms a 12 pointed star shaped fortress with six triangular shaped ravelins . The fortress perimeter is completed with a moat and road with a covered terrace. The three ravelins on the north elevation are constructed on a flat masonry parapet wall topped with escarpment walls in stone. At each angled corner of the northern ravelins there is a cylindrical watchtower with a dome roofs. These ravelins are topped with ramped platforms for canons and launching mortars placements. The three ravelins on the southern elevation have flat masonry parapet walls which are crowned with ramparts of earthworks and like the northern ravelins are topped with ramped platforms for canons and launching mortars placements. These six bastions are called S√£o Francisco, S√£o Jo√£o de Deus, Santa B√°rbara, de Nossa Senhora das Brotas ou do Trem and Santo Ant√≥nio e S√£o Pedro. The S√£o Jo√£o de Deus ravelin has integrated large bunkers built into its interior. = Gateway = To access the fortress the main gate is located at the south east curtain wall between Santo Ant√≥nio e S√£o Pedro and S√£o Francisco and features a set of two long tunnel gateways separated by a bridge over the dry moat. the outer arched tunnel is called Porta da muralha the inside tunnel gateway is called Porta S√£o Francisco. The facade of this gate features an arched entrance with double Doric columns either side. The columns are topped by a semi-circular shaped pediment. below the pediment and above the entrance there is a heraldic blazon or crest of arms.

History The castle seen from the keep with courtyard and semi-circular towers The inner walls from the courtyard The Governor's residence within the courtyard addorsed to the northern and eastern walls This region of the Alentejo had been settled since pre-history by disperse tribes, but it was first mentioned in the writings of Ptolemy and Polybius. But, it was sometime between the beginning of the 3rd century and the end of the 4th century, that the walls of Pax Julia were constructed; part of the Roman arch (√âvora Gate) dated from this general construction in the Roman provinces. Its importance within the region continued during the Suebi era, Visigothic settlement and Moors occupation of the Iberian peninsula. During the Reconquista from the Moors, the region was first conquered in 1159 by the forces of King Afonso Henriques (1112-1185), but it was abandoned four months later by his forces. In 1253, King D. Afonso III began work on reconstructing the fortress, which was already a severe stage of degradation. A foral (charter) was issued to Beja in 1254. Around 1307, a tower was constructed along the wall, as indicated in an inscription carved into decorated ashlar masonry, in the form of a Portuguese shield, and dating to the Visigoth occupation. King D. Dinis ordered the construction of the keep tower in 1310, following the issue of new charter. Work on the walls proceed from 1347, under the overseer Jo√£o Domingues de Beja and Afonso Mendes (from an inscription). The village supported the King John I during 1383-1385 Portuguese succession crisis. At the beginning of the 16th century, King D. Manuel I began a project to improve the fortification, that possibly included the construction of the vaulted ceiling in the keep tower. During this time, a second larger gate was constructed between the Roman arch (which had disappeared) and the Hospital of Miseric√≥rdia. A project to reinforce the bastions was initiated in 1664 by Nicolau de Langres, approved by Lu√≠s Serr√£o Pimentel (Royal engineer and cosmographer) and General Agostinho de Andrade Freire. Between 1669 and 1679, the endeavour was supervised by engineers Jo√£o Coutinho, Diogo de Brito de Castanheda and Manuel Almeida Falc√£o. In 1790, part of the fortifications were demolished in order to construct the new church of the (extinct) Col√©gio dos Jesu√≠tas, for the Episcopal See. In the early nineteenth century, following the outbreak of the Peninsular Wars, the city of Beja opposed Napoleonic troops, and as a result, the forces under the command of General Jean-Andoche Junot in 1808, killed about 1,200 people in the region. Most of the work accomplished on the site were associated with 1854, following the events of the Liberal Wars, when the region was devastated. In 1867, the Moorish Gate was reconstructed, but two years later, the New Gate of √âvora was demolished, since it affected/impeded transit. Similar issues resulted in the demolition of the Hermitage of Nossa Senhora da Guia and Romana arch of the Aviz Gate in 1893. =20th century= The tower keep seen from the southern Rua Antero de Quental The Portuguese government classified the castle as National Monument by Decree published on 16 June 1910. In order to recuperate the architectural heritage, in 1938 the Roman arch (√âvora Gate) was reconstructed and the fortification walls rebuilt from the backyards and homes that intersected the old lines. This involved the removing obstructions, consolidation of the Gate, reconstruction of the Alc√°c√ßova and Roman arch. Over time there were various individual projects: in 1965, work on the keep tower; in 1969, consolidation of the tower and walls between Rua das Portas Aljustrel and Rua da Liberdade; between 1970-1973, consolidation between castle and Avis Gate; between 1980-1981, recuperation of the castle, Aviz Gate and keep; and in 1982, general work on the walls. This movement culminated in the 1960s study to re-landscape and integrate the old fortifications into aesthetic of the town, undertaken by architectural landscaper Ant√≥nio Viana Barreto. A competition was initiated on 16 March 2004, sponsored by the DGEMN/DREMS, to recuperate the area that included the castle, supported the following year (September), by a risk assessment study by the DGEMN. This work had begun in 2003, with the clearing of built vegetation accumulated in the walls, battlements and joints, and the repair of these segments with lime mortar and sand, as well as the treatment of parapets and adarves. The municipal council continued between 2007 and 2008, with the removal of evasive plants, cleaning of bird droppings and the construction of structures to impede further destruction by birds. This work lead to the implementation of a February 2008 program to reuse the former Governor's Residence into a military museum, tourist centre and cafeteria. The first archaeological excavations were initiated in 2008 by the municipal authority of Beja. In November 2014, due to issues of safety and security, the keep tower was closed to the public, following the collapse of a balcony. It was only reopened on 19 July 2016. Between 2014 and 2015, archeological excavations were undertaken at the top of the hilltop of Outeiro do Circo, that also included conservation of the keep tower. The following year, in March, during work in the park of Vista Alegre, archaeological vestiges of a gate and former-Roman wall, and in August, further excavations were initiated in Outeiro do Circo along the northwest wall, associated with the late Bronze Age fortification. A joint project between the C√¢mara Municipal of Beja and the DRCAlentejo continued to work on conservation in the keep tower, costing 500,000 Euros, that included a 2016 project to recuperate the walls of the Terreirinho das Pe√ßas, for 71,000 Euros. Architecture Detail of the keep tower with its alternating rectangular and polygonal floors Detail of the machicolations from the first floors to the third The remnants of the castle are situated on a hilltop, along which extends the wall fortifications of the city Beja, encircled by landscaped gardens. Immediately nearby are the S√© Cathedral, Chapel of Santo Amaro, the building of the Hospital da Miseric√≥rdia, residences of the Guedes and Campos families, and municipal palace. The castle is the principal nucleus of a group of fortifications that encompass the medieval city, implanted in its northwest corner. It is an irregular pentagonal plan, with a partially-encircled irregular barbican to the north and southern line. The two lines of walls are lined with parallel merlons over embrasures, internally encircled by adarves and reinforced by corbels and towers, protected by battlements towers. The exception is the eastern tower, an irregular pentagon, addorsed externally on the castle angle, and two semi-circular corbel, that reinforces the southeast barbican with gates. The Pra√ßa de Armas (place-of-arms) is accessible from these gates which links to the other wall fortifications, between corbels, and the other open to the north. In the interior, addorsed to the north and eastern walls, is the two-storey Casa do Governador (Governor's Residence). The residence has a first-floor chimney with entrance torn by arched openings, one that provides access to barbican to the north, that includes second-storey windows. The tower keep is situated in the northeast, and projects to the exterior; it is tall tower, approximately three stories, with adarves and machicolations and marked by prismatic merlons and covered with a terrace. Each space has different plans. The first registry, includes has two pentagonal floors marked by spaces of differing profile: the facade oriented to the pra√ßa de armas has a Roman portico, a balcony window and an arched window. Over this space, circled by adarves, is a smaller second floor, prismatic with small polygonal towers, corresponding to the third floor, with door. Below the parapet covered in merlons with a tri-lobe freise and zoomorphic gargoyles. =Interior= The three floors of the tower are linked by circular staircase, with one space per floor, the floors are rectangular on the first and third floors and octagonal on the second floor. The first floor is covered with polygonal copula and ribs over half columns, decorated in sculpted vegetal surfaces. The second floor is illuminated by four windows and includes a vaulted ceiling with ribs forming an eight-pointed star and decorated in with vegetal forms supported by anthropomorphic sculptures. Similarly, the third floor is covered in vaulted ceiling cruciform of ogives.

Known locally, as the Castelo dos Templ√°rios (or Templars' Castle), the Romanesque castle was constructed under the orders of King Afonso II of Portugal in 1214. History An engraving depicting the state of the castle during the medieval period One of the remaining towers in the castle The city of Castelo Branco from the perspective of one of the destroyed towers, its stones most likely used in reconstruction work in the same town In 1165, the territory of that would become Castelo Branco was conquered from the Moors and donated to the Knights Templar, who at the time dominated Vila Franca da Cardosa. But, by 1198, King Sancho revised the donation so that half the lands of Castelo Branco were placed within the control of Fernando Sanches. Following the model of √Åvila/√âvora, in 1213 a foral (charter) was issued in 1213. By the following year Cardosa was bequeathed to the Order of the Templo, confirmed in a papal bull issued by Innocence III (in 1245) where, for the first time, the name of Castelo Branco appeared. The first fortification wall was constructed by the Knights Templar between 1214 and 1230, thereby extending their defensive line with Tomar, Monsanto, Z√™zere, Almourol and Pombal. Sometime in the last year, D. Sim√£eo Mendes, Master of the Knights Templar, ordered the construction of a palace for his knights commanders. By the end of the 13th century, during the reign of King Denis the castle included four gates: the Golden Gate, the Gate of Santiago, the Traitors' Gate and the Pelame Gate. In the middle of that century a second curtain of walls was constructed that resulted in the existence of seven gates, rather than the three primitive structures. Sometime during this period construction on the keep tower, that was addorsed to the wall was executed, supported from taxes on cereal grains, wine, meat, hospital leftovers, bottles and residual funds from public wills to approximately 600 pounds. The first reference to the castle's alcalde occurred in a donation letter dated 1 October 1357, when Martim Louren√ßo de Figueiredo was referenced as the responsible for the defensive structure. By 1408 description of the castle included details of three chambers, a tower and two horse stables (with its own kitchen), a cattle shed, barn and guardhouse (to guard the silver). In 1422 a barbican was constructed. In the 1422 Rol dos Besteiros there is a reference to 6390 inhabitants, but by 1496 \\"Inquiries\\", there were just 839 people within its walls. During the 16th century a palace was constructed, but only the tower remains to this day. Duarte D'Armas in his Livro das Fortalezas identifies a grand keep tower and palace building, the Pal√°cio dos Comendadores (Palace of the Commanders) with orchard, a curtain of walls defended by five towers, including one with clocktower. The structure was described as constructed from worked stone, with limestone mortar, material easily wore away within the next years. By 1505 there was as a need to have Mateus Fernandes to analyse the need for work on the structure. The castle at that time included eight gates: \\"Ouro\\" (Gold) Gate, \\"Trai√ß√£o\\" (Traitors') Gate, \\"Esp√≠rito Santo\\" (Holy Spirit) Gate, \\"Rel√≥gio\\" (Clocktower) Gate, \\"Vila\\" (Town) Gate, \\"Esteval\\" (Stable) Gate, \\"Santiago\\" (St. Jame's) Gate and \\"Santar√©m\\" Gate. The need to repair the structure lead to the nomination of √Ålvaro Cardoso to receive the monies for the work on the castle on 20 November 1510. With the growth of the town, there were 1417 inhabitants, leading to the King John III to title the village as Not√°vel (Notable) in 1535. In the 17th century, the last commanders inhabited the Commanders palace: D. Fernando and D. Ant√≥nio de Meneses. On 22 May 1704, a Franco-Spanish force invaded the territory and battle at the castle resulted in the partial destruction of the walls. A capsule from 1706 describes the palace as having a masonry portico access with stables to the right and a cistern on the left, fed from rainwater collected on the Church of Santa Maria. The square was fortified with a wall, situated between church and palace. From the four-arch, covered-entrance is a wood patio in chestnut with corner guardhouse. To the left is a staircase with 28 steps alongside the kitchen, with two windowed rooms with fireplaces. The three-floor tower with singular window and garret, for the titular of guarda roupa, was connected to the keep tower. In October 1753, the old keep continued exist in an optimal state of conservation. In 1762, the square was sacked, during the events of the Seven Years' War; the square was ultimately disincorporated/demilitarized per the 1763 Treaty of Paris. This began a slow devolution of the importance of the structure, resulting in the 6 November 1769 extinguishing of the title of alcalde at the castle. Although the town was elevated to the status of city on 20 March 1771, and became the seat of the bishop, this did not stop the castle's decline. In the first quarter of the 19th century, a new doorway was constructed to link to the barbican. During the course of the Peninsular War, during Junot's march to Lisbon, the castle was left in ruin. Some work was done in 1818 to remedy the damage. In 1821, stones from the castle were and palace were removed by local inhabitants in order to construct their own homes. On 17 July 1835, an ordinance from municipal council conceded a license to destroy the arches in the walls, and to reuse those stones for public projects. As a consequence, the stones forming the \\"Vila\\", \\"Rel√≥gio\\" and \\"Esp√≠rito Santo\\" Gates were destroyed and their stones used in the construction of the Ponte da Granja. A similar dispatch on 9 March 1839 allowed the sale of the stone from the castle, as well as roofing tiles and wood from the palace. It was followed by a similar provision on 20 March for a further group of tile and wood. In 1851, the municipal council studied the possibility of implanting a cemetery in the locale, but the idea was abandoned in 1864, owing to the location being excessively rocky. In the second half of the 19th century, owing to the actions of the Civil Governor, Guilhermino de Barros, a few of the walls were reconstructed, in addition to the structures of the palace. But, on 15 November 1852, a violent storm destroyed the keep walls and other fortifications, resuscitating the original plan to convert the site into a cemetery and ceding the lands to the municipal council. Over the course of successive years there were attempts to repurpose the structure following periods of destruction and phases of initiative. Within ten years of the violent storm the \\"Postiguinho\\" Gate was destroyed. Between 1875 and 1876, construction began on adapting the former \\"palace\\" into a residence for the schoolteacher, but the plans were later abandoned. On 18 May 1893, the municipal council verified that the walls of the barbican of the \\"Esp√≠rito Santo\\" Gate was in a state of ruin, and risked the properties of three landowners, if the walls were not demolished or repairs concluded. =20th century= By the beginning of the 20th century, the castle served little histo-cultural purpose and the municipal authorities used it a backdrop to local concerns. In 1929, the municipality constructed a public urinal along the wall of the Rua Vaz Preto. Within the next year, the last wall tower collapsed, after a period of ruin. In 1933, three water reservoirs were constructed, adjudicated to Manuel Figueira, in lands acquired for 6.000$00 Portuguese escudos. A storm caused a landslide that destroyed the eastern/northern corner tower, leading to a formal request to the DGEMN to begin a project of restoration and lookout. Simultaneously, the municipality solicited ideas for the reconstruction of the castle from Engineer Manuel Tavares dos Santos, but lacking any funds, this project was abandoned. By 1975, the possibility of demolishing the wall along Rua Vaz Preto was examined: the DGEMN analyzed the walls along this corridor in 1977, in order to determine the viability, while the municipal authority expropriated homes along the segment of the walls. In 1981, structures that belonged to the GNR, and which were addorsed to the walls along the Rua Vaz Preto were demolished. During the course of the demolition of houses along Rua Vaz Preto, part of the original wall and towers were re-discovered. This led to the 5 June 2009 proposal to seek a formal classification of the site's heritage status. On 26 October 2009, the DRCCentro requested the castle's classification as a Property of Public Interest. It was accepted on 28 October by the consultative council of IGESPAR, but the process was archived on 7 January 2013, and the site never obtained its classification. Architecture The castle is located on a granite hilltop at approximately within the Cerro da Cardoza, a region dominated in the southeast by the Serra de Monforte; the Serra da Gardunha and Serra da Estrela, to the north; and to the northeast, the frontier with Idanha-a-Nova. Other historical buildings immediately surrounding the castle include the residence at Rua D'Ega, 92, the Church of Santa Maria do Castelo and buildings used in the housing of pilgrims, the Casa dos Romeiros. What remains of the castle is the line of walls, that connected one of the towers with the main keep of the commanders' palace. The 15th century defensive tower is laid out in the form of a rectangle, and is accessible within from a staircase. The facade oriented towards the west is practically destroyed, but is marked by two balcony windows: one on the first and the other on the second floors. The second floor windows are actually dual windows with chamfered arcs. Meanwhile, the northern facade has a single window on the second floor, with rectangular lintel and arch. Within the walls of the castle is the Church of Santa Maria do Castelo.

History Fortified medieval settlement of Cola, a castro later converted to Islamic outpost The construction of the ancient occurred, and human occupation fixed itself on this site, around the beginning of the Bronze Age. During the period of Islamic influence within the Iberian peninsula, the castro was reinforced to serve as an outpost. The fortification controlled one of the principal routes of passage into the Algarve. Of the artifacts discovered there are objects dating to the pre- and proto-cultural episodes of the region, including: polished stone axes, fragments of Iron Age vessels, rural ceramics, glass beads, gold, needle bone, bronze bracelets, drills, firing pins, spheroids; historical objects: Roman-Visigoth ceramics, Arabic and Portuguese Medieval metal objects (screws, cossoiros, buckles, keys, rings, etc.), stone objects (millstones, spheroids throwing, firing pins), hewn Roman and Visigothic stones, Arab tombstones, coins, Roman lamps. The site was abandoned during the 14th century, based on the research of Abel Viana. Yet, this is contradicted by Rosa Varela Gomes, who suggests that that abandonment of the site occurred sometime between the 15th and 16th century. Excavations on the site were realized in 1960, under the direction of Abel Viana. During this period the walls of the southeast corner were consolidated (1961) Further investigations and reinforcement of the northern parts of the castle were accomplished in 1962, followed once again in 1963 by work completed by Abel Viana. In 1999, it was included within the Programa de Valoriza√ß√£o e Divulga√ß√£o Tur√≠stica (Tourist Valorization and Appreciation Program), by the Ministry of Commerce and Tourism () and Secretary of State for Culutre, and included as part of the archaeological itineraries for the Alentejo and Algarve regions. In order to improve tourist visits, a new interpretative center and reception area was constructed between 1999 and 2000, by architect Sofia Salema. In 2001, archaeological excavations were carried out on the site. Architecture The castro is located in a rural environment, on the crest of a mountain above the river valley, along the Ribeira do Marchic√£o and near the Rio Mira. The landscape, which is above the Rio Mira, is protected by walls of the fortification to the southwest and northeast. Near the site is the Church of Nossa Senhora da Cola, an annual destination for pilgrims.

The plan of the castle consists of an irregular -long polygon, with width, consisting of thick walls, although in some areas this width was between . These walls were reinforced by unequal-sized rectangular blocks. A main gate is located on the south wall, defended by a large tower, of thicker construction. A thick wall divides the courtyard into two zones to the south. Here a cistern, dug from the rock, , is located, with semi-circular vaulted ceiling and square .

History The vestigaes of the buildings and shelters within the walls of Faria = Early History = A plaque erected to honour the heroic death of Nuno Gon√ßalves da Faria The site has been occupied by a long human presence beginning in the 3rd or 2nd millennium BCE. There are vestiges of the late Bronze Age settlement, that continued until the late Roman era. In the Middle Ages, buildings at the top of the hill were adapted as a castle for the Terra de Faria, a period of notable bellicose and symbolic importance in the Entre-Douro-e-Minho, during the early Middle Ages. Faria's form corresponds to the 9th-10th-century structure, first referenced in 1099, the year that the fortress was given to Soeiro Mendes da Maia. It is evident from this nobleman's name, the importance of the castle to the foundations of the Portuguese nobility, that dominated the politics of the county of Portucale. This importance was confirmed during the 12th century, from a series of documents and from the prestige of some nobles that were responsible for the fortification, such as Erm√≠gio Riba Douro, Mem de Riba Vizela or Garcia de Sousa. = Medieval Era = The hilltop of the powerful Terra de Faria, has been associated with a local myth of its role in the revolt of the counts of Portucale against Theresa, Countess of Portugal, who directed the Battle of S√£o Mamede (1128) and ascension to the throne of Afonso Henriques. Before these events, many fortresses swore loyalty to the future King, in opposition to Theresa and her lover Fernando P√©rez de Traba. Among these were Neiva (along the north of the Douro) and Santa Maria da Feira (along the southern extension), creating a revolution that was truly \\"national\\" in scope. These castles passed from various noblemen's hands in the chronicle of Galician-Portuguese and Spanish-Portuguese conflict; for some time, there were doubts whether the castle referred to as Faria, was not actually Santa Maria da Feira. After studies by Mattoso, Krus and Andrade (1989), the consensual opinion was that the claims by A. de Almeida Fernandes (1991) had never been refuted. It was, along with the Castle of Neiva, one of the first fortifications to be seized by the Infante Afonso Henriques in his revolt against his mother, Theresa in 1128. It was site of the 1373 episode between Nuno Gon√ßalves da Faria and his battles with the Kingdom of Castile. Nuno Gon√ßalves the alcalde of the castle was imprisoned by the Castilians in 1373, and taken by force to the castle in order to force his son to surrender. But his son would not yield, and his father was killed in front of the castle. In 1400, King John I donated the castle to D. Gon√ßalo Telles de Meneses, who ordered the erection of his Fleur-de-lis coat-of-arms (which became the emblem of the Counts of Faria). But, in the 15th century, with rise to the throne of the Avis dynasty, the castle began to decline and slowly lost its importance. Yet, the castle still retains the honor of the most comprehensive treasurer of nationalist artifacts from Middle Ages: belt buckles, helts, and swords, chain-mail and armaments were salvaged from the ruined fortress.M√°rio Jorge Barroca (2000), p.234 Also from the site was a batch of coins from the reign of King Ferdinand,Pedro Batalha Reis (1950) while doubt still plagues the Tomb of Faria, from excavations by Carla Varela Fernandes, in 2001-2002, and Carlos Alberto Ferreira de Almeida (1990), which had been brought from the castle. During its ruin, in the 16th century, the stones of the castle were used in the construction of the Convent of Bom Jesus do Monte in Franqueira. =Republican Era= Archaeological excavations were undertaken in 1929, by the group Alcaides de Faria, and then, repeated between 1936 and 1940. The group Alcaides de Faria continue to hold the artifacts excavated during the investigation of the 1930s. Reconstruction of the walls and tower keep began in 1939, that included closing hashes in the structure, cleaning of the cornices, and the removal of materials and debris from the works. Cleaning projects, oriented by the Campo Arqueol√≥gico da Universidade de Braga were initiated in 1978. Between 1981 and 1985, Brochado de Almeida and Teresa Soeiro, from the Faculty of Letters, at the University of Porto undertook new excavations on the site, in order to realize a comprehensive understanding of the site. Architecture The castle is situated in a rural environment, located on a steep and rocky hillside on the northwestern flank of the Monte da Franqueira, covered in dense pines, in a commanding position over the C√°vado River. Faria has three lines of walls that involved the settlement, that clearly identify a castro origin from the Iron Age. The outer wall, towards the east, and before the opening of the road linking Franqueira to the parish of Milhazes, had an extensive trench. Between this wall and the next, interior wall, is, to the east, are remnants of 10 castro-era buildings, some circular and oval, with some including vestibule and fireplace. To the east, on either side of the second wall, are vestiges of circular and rectangular buildings. In the interior of the superior courtyard, is the tower keep of the medieval castle, in a rectangular plan, with the remnants of the walls of the \\"palace of the alcalde\\". Between this and the lateral wall, but lower, is a slope that sustain the lands of the upper terrace.

Its walls surrounded the entire city of Lagos, providing the town its main means of defence.  History  = Early History = Due to its strategic location, this stretch of coastline has been successively occupied since prehistoric times. In antiquity, the region was visited by Greek navigators, Phoenicians and Carthaginians. When the Romans arrived in the Iberian Peninsula, the primitive village had the Latinized name of Lac√≥briga (also written Laccobriga). The new settlement received a quadrangular wall for its defence. The town of Lagos was occupied by Visigoths and later on, in the eight century, by Muslim Moors from North Africa, who renamed the town as 'Zawiya'. Abd-ar-Rahman III, Caliph of Cordoba, conquered the town in 929 and provided it with towers. The size of these works reflected the economic and strategic importance the town enjoyed, which had a privileged access to Muslim Silves. = Middle Ages = During the Christian reconquest of the Iberian peninsula, the region was conquered by King Sancho I (1185-1211) in 1189. Almohad Caliph Abu Yusuf Yaqub al-Mansur reconquered the place in 1191, only to be retaken in 1241 by Paio Peres Correia. From this time there is little reliable information regarding the town's defences under Muslim rule. King Afonso III (1248-1279) began works on the city's walls, which were continued by King Denis (1279-1325) and his successor Afonso IV (1325-1357). From 1361 onwards, the town of Lagos was separated from the jurisdiction of Silves, reaching administrative independence. In the context of the Portuguese discoveries, Lagos played an important role. Nearby Sagres was one of the support bases for the conquest of North Africa and the operations of Henry the Navigator (1394-1460), in the first phases of the Age of Discoveries. Due to its harbour, as well as facilities where Caravels and other vessels were built, Lagos played a crucial role in the rise of the Portuguese Empire. From Lagos left: * 1415 - Portuguese expeditions to conquer Ceuta in North of Africa; * 1419 - Vessels for the discovery of Madeira; * 1427 - Vessels for the discovery of the Azores; * 1434 - Gil Eanes vessel that crossed Cape Bojador on the West African coast; * 1458 and 1472 - The expeditions of King Afonso V (1438-1481) to conquer Ksar es-Seghir, Asilah and Tangier in the North of Africa. Despite Lagos's strategic importance, in 1475 the Court registered complaints regarding the poor conditions of the Algarve's fortifications, including the one in Lagos, after which reconstruction works began throughout the region. = Later Middle Ages = With the reign of King John II (1481-1495), the Company of Guinea was moved from Lagos to new premises in Lisbon (1481-1482). King John II and his successor also carried out conservation work on the defenses of Lagos, who endowed it with an aqueduct for the water supply, built somewhere between 1490 and 1521. King King Manuel I (1495-1521) granted a second Foral Charter in 1504, reformed a decade later, giving start to the construction of the Governors's Palace. Under the expansionist project of King Sebastian (1568-1578), Lagos became a city in 1573, becoming the capital of the Kingdom of the Algarve and the residence of the Captains General and Governors. His successor, Cardinal Henry (1578-1580), confirmed the title in 1579. During the Iberian Union, the strength of Lagos's defences increased. The city managed to fiercely oppose the landing of Francis Drake's forces in 1587, forcing Drake to seek a more vulnerable point in that stretch of coast (eventually attacking Sagres). The damage applied by the English artillery to Lagos, as well as the fear of new attacks on the coast, led to the reconstruction and modernization of its defenses in the following years. * 1598 - completed work on the second wall * 1621 - modernization and strengthening of the most fortified medieval section = Post Middle Ages = View of the walls that surround the historical centre At the time of the restoration of Portuguese independence, conservation works were undertaken on the walls (1642), when the proposal to build a large, pentagonal plant with five bastions at the corners, in the south of the city (1643) was approved. Later, the city and its defences would be severely affected by the tsunami that devastated the Algarve coast as a result of the earthquake of 1755. The resulting destruction was such that the civilian and military governments were transferred to Tavira, less affected by the natural disaster. At the end of the century, the city center was transferred from the old Pra√ßa de Armas (current Pra√ßa Infante D. Henrique) to the Cano Square (now Gil Eanes Square). In the 19th century, the city experienced a surge of economic growth, especially in the fish industry. The walls and ramparts are classified as national monuments by a decree published on June 20, 1924. From the second half of the 1950s, the government, through the Directorate General for National Buildings and Monuments, in view of the celebrations of Centenarians, conducted a wide intervention in the built-up heritage of Lagos, rebuilding addorsed buildings to ancient walls and bulwarks, rebuilding the Palace of the Governors, sections of walls and constructed the Discovery Avenue (Avenida dos Descobrimentos), a landfilled increased protection area between the city and the sea. Recently (2001), the Baluarte of Porta Vila, was reclassified as an astronomical observatory. Characteristics All of the city's defences have an incomplete plant in an irregular pentagon shape. The medieval structure surrounded the town that developed around the Church of Santa Maria do Castelo. The new fence, adapted to firearm artillery, is made up of three flank bastions (from Santa Maria, Alcaria and S√£o Francisco) and four towers (the Pra√ßa de Armas, the Conception, Porta Room and Santo Amaro).

The first gate contains a barrel vault; the second a round arch set into the side walls; the third a blunt arch in the wall separating the two enclosures and the fourth gate is known as the Traitors' Gate. The keep is rectangular in shape and the older of the two towers, built in the 12th century and reportedly by Order of the Knights Templar. It is the highest point built for the purpose of defense. The walls had openings called arrowslits which allowed arrows to be fired at enemies. Its balconies were added during the 14th Century Gothic transformations. The clock tower was added during the Gothic reforms under Denis of Portugal (13th century) and Ferdinand I of Portugal (14th century). Its crenelations are more numerous and narrower.

History One of the towers of the castle, along with manicured gardens The double-tier towers of the castle The Romans first occupied the site, then the remnants of a local castro around the 2nd century, and transformed it into a defensible military fortification and politico- administrative center. In 715, the site was occupied by the Moors. The site was conquered in the 11th century by Ferdinand, King of Le√≥n, but held for little time. It was definitively occupied in 1249 by D. Paio Peres Correia. Several years later (1268) Afonso III had the area populated after reconstructing and expanding the walls. During this period two of the main towers, including the keep tower, were constructed, but the six gates suggest the existence of other towers (only ruins remain).Almeida (1948) A foral (charter) was issued in 1266 from Lisbon by Afonso III of Portugal. Between 9‚Äì12 April 1359, King Peter I overnighted at the alcadaria. In 1422 or 1462, Henrique de Meneses, 1st Count of Loul√© re-built the towers and walls of the castle. A new foral was issued by Manuel of Portugal in 1501. King Sebastian of Portugal overnighted on 29 January 1573. The castle was damaged during an earthquake in 1969.

Mafalda would spend her summers in the settlement and castle. During the early years of the Portuguese monarchy, the region occupied an important position owing to its frontier status. In 1124, Moorish incursions were responsible for taking the castle. In 1151, a foral was issued by D. Afonso Henriques, owing to its military importance: during the 12th century, there were several raids by Moors across the valley of Z√™zere. By that time, Lous√£ was no longer a frontier town, owing to the conquest of Santar√©m, Lisbon and Palmela in 1147. During this time, the kingdom had a policy of settlement that attempted to fix and stabilize the Portuguese population centers and promote further occupation of the land. The keep tower was constructed during the 14th Century. A new foral was issued in 1513 by King D. Manuel. As its military role ceased to be important, the castle fell into disuse. Until 1759, the signeurial rights to the region were maintained by the Dukes of Aveiro, but were transferred back to the Crown. Between the 1940s and 1960s, the DGEMN Dire√ß√£o-Geral dos Edif√≠cios e Monumentos Nacionais (Directorate-General for the Buildings and National Monuments) promoted substantial remodeling to reinforce the structure. Rights to the castle and land were ceded to the municipality on 10 August 1957; on 27 April 2019, the re-qualified castle was inaugurated, later to include a newly constructed viewpoint and visitors' center. Architecture Castle of Lous√£ The small castle with irregular, hexagonal plan encircles a small courtyard. It is dominated in the north by a keep tower, that is addorsed to the wall, consisting of a rectangular structure with ogival doorway at the level of the chemin de ronde covered in arrowslits. Chamfered merlons terminate the supper part of the structure. The main entrance is located in the southeast corner and is protected by two semi- cylindrical corbels. An elongated corbel is located to the southwest, while two smaller corbels are situated in the west of the castle, that complete the defensive structures along the walls that are completed with chamfered merlons, similar to those in the keep tower.

History  The engraving from the Book of Fortresses by Duarte d'Armas showing the castle on the clifftops A modern view of the same view of the fortress of Monsanto Another view above the hilltop fortress and fortifications of Monsanto The site was likely the location of fortified settlement during prehistory. Legend suggests that during the 2nd century a castro was taken and colonized on the hilltop of Mons Sanctus, by Roman Praetor Lucius Aemilius Paullus. The castro was destroyed and progressively settled by settlers from Idanha-a-Velha. Between the 5th and 11th century was occupied by Visigoths and Arabs. In order to building a defensive line and strengthen his presence in the region, D. Afonso I of Portugal donated the area to D. Gualdim Pais, Master of the Templars; a vast region, that extended to the territory of Egit√¢nea (corresponding to Idanha-a- Velha) along the Rio Erges. :\\"Afonso, remarkable king of the Portuguese\\" (Portugalensium rex)\\", son of Henry and Queen D. Teresa and grandson of the great and illustrious Emperor of Hispania, for us to master Galdino and all the brothers of the Knights Templar who are in my kingdom, I make a wide and giving very strong in the region of Idanha [-a-Velha] and Monsanto with the limits: Following the course of the river and between Erges my kingdom and the 'legions' to enter the [river] Tagus and the other party following the course of water [river] Z√™zere River which also enters the river Tagus (...). \\" (Letter of Donation on 30 November 1165.) The castles of Monsanto and Idanha- a-Velha were constructed by 1171, when a foral (charter) was donated to the settlement, following the model of √Åvila/√âvora. During the course of litigation with the Order of the Temple in 1172, the castle was donated to the Order of Santiago (\\"facio cartam donationis de castello meo proprio quad dicitur Mons Sanctus\\"), with the condition of not nominating an unknown commander. As a result of this change, in 1174, a new foral was issued to the inhabitants of Monsanto, by D. Afonso Henriques, which was confirmed in 1190 by D. Sancho I. A contemporary castle was constructed during the 13th century. It was reconstructed in the 14th century, during the reigns of King D. Dinis and D. Fernando. But, following its alignment with the Kingdom of Castile during the 1383‚Äì1385 Portuguese interregnum, the site began to fall into disorder. According to the chronicler Fern√£o Lopes, Monsanto was a village that had been loyal to Queen Beatrice. But, later however, Lopes listed the town among those aligned themselves with D. John by 1384. Beginning in the 1476, the area was reconstructed during the reign of King D. John I, resulting in the construction of a barbican and protection over the well, a large chamber that belonged to the Castro family (later identified as providing abundant water for the site). By 1496, the Inquiri√ß√£o indicated 309 inhabitants. At the beginning of the 16th century, there was a graphic survey by Duarte de Armas for his Book of Fortresses, designing the castle with two access gates (the oldest opened to the cliffs) and protected by two towers. In total there were four towers, a keep and cistern. The Torre do Pi√£o (lookout tower) was in ruins at that time. Supported by an alcalde, the urban nucleus included the parish of S√£o Miguel and the parish of S√£o Salvador. In the late 16th century, there was work performed during the reign of King D. Manuel I. By 1527, during the Numeramento (medieval census) there were 494 inhabitants. In the second half of the 17th century, the structures were adapted to support artillery, with the construction of earthenworks, batteries and canon emplacements, as well as fortification walls for the colony. This followed the 1704 siege by Franco-Spanish forces, under the command of the Duke of Berwick, but later liberated by the Marquess of Minas. By 1758, surveys of the site indicated one of the towers in ruin. Reconstruction of the fortification walls were undertaken by order of William, Count of Schaumburg-Lippe following the Spanish invasion of Portugal. Similar alterations were built in 1801, a slope was established in order to implant canons. Major Eus√©bio Furtado was later responsible for the installation military garrison in 1813, resulting in major works on the castle. But, in 1815, there was an explosion of the magazine powder keg, resulting in the partial destruction of the castle. Surveys were undertaken by military engineer Maximiano Jos√© da Serra following the disaster, and military descriptions for the site were written in 1823, by Eus√©bio C√¢ndido Cordeiro Pinheiro Furtado. An 1831 collapse of a cliff resulted in the destruction of an exterior wall and a time when the Chapel of Santa Maria was in a state of ruin. Meanwhile, the Church of S√£o Miguel continued to be open to the cult as late as 1834. In 1853, the municipality of Monsanto was extinguished, leaving its second-order military status and militia. The 12th Infantry Regiment was stationed to the square of Monsanto in 1887. The first work on repairing or conserving the site began in 1940, when the DGEMN Dire√ß√£o-Geral de Edif√≠cios e Monumentos Nacionais (Directorate- General of Buildings and National Monuments) began restoration of the walls, detailed excavations on site and removal of topsoil. In the following two years, the work continued with consolidation of the walls and granite, construction and placement of masonry. Between 1957 and 1958, further work began that included further repairs to the walls, reconstruction of the towers and reinforcement of the ashlar stones. In 1986, complementary work continued in the castle area that included repairing loose ashlars and consolidation of the pavement along the adarve in the west. Between 1988 and 1989, there was work on consolidating the walls and pavements, the adarve and accessways to the castle. Much of the archaeological artefacts extracted from Monsanto were dispersed throughout various museums, among which were the Museum Francisco Tavares Proen√ßa J√∫nior in Castelo Branco. Architecture The view from the accessway to the castle The castle was located in an urban-rural location, in an area that marks the territory, on a hilltop that is above sea level, situated on the right margin of the Rio Ponsul and overlooking the urban nucleus and parish of S√£o Salvador. The site dominates the plains that extend to the Serra da Gardunha (in the west), Idanha and reservoir. Within its walls is the Chapel of Santa Maria do Castelo, the ruins of the Chapel of S√£o Jo√£o and Romanesque Church of S√£o Miguel, vestiges of the old settlement, and several telecommunication towers. Surrounding this are several tombs and carved openings in the rock faces, an area characterized by granite outcroppings and abrupt cliff faces. In the east, is a lookout to the eastern frontier, with the south and southeast overlooking the valleys of Ponsol and Aravil, in addition to the Cerro da Cardoza. In the north is the Serra da Estrela (Portugal's tallest continental mountain range) and views of the Castle of Penamacor and Castle of Belmonte. =Fortress= The entranceway into the courtyard from within the compound A view of the inner courtyard of castle with walls and towers The fortress consists of three walled courtyards: an outer irregular exterior wall that encircles two other lines of walls. These segments, with staircases to access the adarve, lack merlons. The enclosure includes a main door preceded by Casa do Guarda (guardhouse), a rectangular floored compartment, with arched eastern access door. In the interior, there is an archway, surmounted by an orifice for the coat-of-arms, flanked by an armillary sphere. On the right hand side is an inscription that is indecipherable. On the northern elevation are three cross-sectional bombardments, one on the northeastern angle. The main arched gate in the north covered by vaulted ceiling and false door on the south tower. The enclosure includes four towers attached on the outer side of the walls. Two have rectangular plans and are devoid of spans, in the north; an identical tower on the east; and a square-shaped tower on the south, with access via a flight of stairs perpendicular to the adarve, presenting a straight lintel doorway in the northern elevation. Inside the enclosure is a cistern next to a cliff, presenting two full arches and absence of cover. The walled enclosure, adjacent to the main entrance, features a rectangular outline and a full arch door inserted in the south section, that includes battery with four canon emplacements, equipped with two ramps. Inserted into the western side is an irregular oblong segment with full arched door and protrusions that integrates a square-shaped tower on the exterior. A geodetic marker is situated over this segment. From this enclosure are rocky outcroppings with grooves and rubble corresponding to the foundations of other towers and missing wall segments. The Torre do Pi√£o is located outside the walls, in an elevation bordering the castle, overlooking the ruins of the Church of S√£o Miguel. A square plan, only part of the walls corresponding to the first incomplete register are visible. Defensive structures of S√£o Salvador include the Gates of Santo Ant√≥nio and Esp√≠rito Santo, the so-called bulwark or battery and wall section annexed to the Chapel of Santo Ant√≥nio and cemetery. The Gate of Santo Ant√≥nio, faces the west, and includes a straight lintel integrating laterally three gaps, surmounted by the royal coat-of-arms and topped by small parapet. Addorsed to the gate is a square guard tower covered in stonework, with door of straight lintel in the east. The Gate of Esp√≠rito Santo is oriented in a full arch on the outside and a straight lintel on the inner side, flanked by two gaps, with an attached guard post partially covered, with door and lintel in the west, as well as cracks in the north and east. The battery over the parking area, in Largo do Baluarte, is trapezoidal, with curtain walls over the escarpment, with door and flanked by two rectangular windows in the west. =Chapels= A view of the Chapel of Santa Maria do Castelo The Chapel of Nossa Senhora do Castelo is located inside the walls, next to the battery, with longitudinal plan and comprising two juxtaposed rectangles. Its main facade (to the west) is delimited by Tuscan pilasters, torn by a hollowed arch portal with protruding stone and flanked by a small quadrangular opening and gable with cornice. The lateral elevations include doors of straight lintels, and a southern window in the body of the main chapel. Near the chapel are three trapezoidal tombs and a group of anthropomorphic excavations in the isolated rocks. The ruins of the Chapel of S√£o Jo√£o includes a perfect arch and is isolated in the eastern flank of the castle. =Church= The ruins of the Church of S√£o Miguel do Castelo The ruins of the Church of S√£o Miguel with longitudinal plant composed of two juxtaposed rectangles and absence of cover/ceiling. Its main facade is oriented to the west, and includes full arch door with four archivolts, imposing towers and capitals with zoomorphic decoration. The northern column displays a standard cubit measure, and it is decorated in cornices. Also in the northern facade are three arcosolia in a broken arch, two in the nave and one in the main chapel, with a full arch doorway with straight tympanum and a straight lintel. The cornice was decorated in spheres and geometric motifs. In the east there are gaps in the nave and chapel with simple cornice. The unique nave temple is situated on a slope accessed by seven steps and conserves a rectangular altar, fragment of baptismal fountain (in the form of a chalice), columnar base and other fragments of granite. A triumphal arch are supported with posts decorated with armillary spheres. The bell tower is situated on a granite cliff, over two/twin arches.

History A castro probably existed on the site of the fortification and was later re-appropriated by the Romans. By 960 A.D. the first reference to the castle of Moraria appeared in the will of D. Fl√¢mula Rodrigues. It was donated to the Convent of Guimar√£es in the intervening years. In 997, it was taken by Alman√ßor, and remained in the possession of the caliphate until 1055, when it was reconquered by forces of Ferdinand I of Le√≥n. Superficial vestiges of interior foundations were discovered indicating the first structures constructed on the site were attributed to the 12th century. The first foral (charter) was conceded by D. Afonso Henriques; the territory remained in the hands of Fern√£o Mendes of Bragan√ßa until his death, when it reverted to Crown. In 1217, the foral was conferred by King D. Afonso II. Sometime in 1247, the site was a staging location for King D. Sancho II, before his exile to Toledo. The Rol dos Besteiros (1422) suggested that 1065 inhabitants occupied the grounds around the castle, yet the 1496 Inquiri√ß√£o (Inquiries) determined little more than 202 residents. In 1512 a new foral was issued, resulting in the castles dominion by Fonseca Coutinho and, later, the Marquess of Castelo Rodrigo. Shortly after (in 1527), the Numeramento (the census of the kingdom) suggested a population of 428 inhabitants. In 1853, during a visit by Alexandre Herculano, the author indicated an advanced state of destruction and ruin. During this period, the courtyard was used as a quarry. Between 1920 and 1930, Father J√∫lio C√©sar Gomes advocated/promoted that materials should not be used from the site for local buildings. By this time there continued to exist two cisterns: one at the hilltop covered in vaulted ceiling and another to the northwest. The first efforts to restore the site occurred in 1942 by the Direc√ß√£o Geral dos Edif√≠cios e Monumentos Nacionais (General-Directorate for Buildings and National Monuments) involving the restoration of the walls and corners, a task that was continued the following year and 1945, that included rebuilding the walls and reinforcement, along with excavation and leveling of dirt. Architecture A view of the valley and village of Moreira de Rei The site is a mix of natural, rural and urban landscaping, occupying the extreme incline of a hilltop above sea level, that includes granite stones and poulders incorporated into the construction. The site overlooks the valley and old village, that includes vestiges of the walls a little distance from the pillory and Church of Santa Marinha, while to the south are the castles of Trancoso and Marialva. The castle's fortifications are formed by a double line of walls, with the exterior portion largely incomplete, save for some lines along the east, south and north. The interior walls form an irregular oval, with a curtain of walls devoid of merlons in the east. The northern limits, marked a linear wall is largely defended by rock boulders of large dimensions. Still visible is the base of a rectangular keep tower in the northwest, while elements of a rectangular tower to the northeast are visible. Over the rocky surface to the northeast are marks of the wall foundations, creating an orthogonal inflection. The centre of the courtyard was excavated to reveal a rectangular deposit. Remains of the urban perimeter wall are limited to segments in the area once occupied by a northern gate.

History Main gate with flanked towers and clocktower The tower keep of the castle of Redondo In 1250, a foral (charter) attributed to King D. Afonso III was issued to Redondo. At the same time, the king ordered the construction of a castle over the ruins of the ancient Roman fortress.Almeida (1948) The castle was part of the northern Alentejo fortifications restructured by King D. Dinis that were donated to members of the nobility during the late medieval epoch, representing significant alterations during the Manueline era. By order of King D. Dinis, in 1312, the castle was reconstructed, during the same epoch as the erection of the keep tower and the fortification wall and towers. On 27 April 1318, the foral was reconfirmed by King D. Dinis. In 1418, King D. John conceded privileges to the castle and obligated that travellers between Alandroal and Vila Vi√ßosa pass through the settlement, as a way of expanding commercial activities in the town. Between the 15th and 16th century, the Torre da Alcaidaria (Alcalde Tower) lost most of its importance, while the residence of Redondo petitioned the king to construct a new tower. By the end of the 15th century, the construction of the keep tower was completed, and the structure became part of the donation of Vasco Coutinho, by King D. Manuel I. On 2 June 1500, Vasco Coutinho was nominated as captain of Arzila, as the first Count of Redondo. A new foral was signed by King D. Manuel I on 20 October 1516. Sometime in the 18th century, there were reports of vestiges of the palace of the Counts of Redondo in the periphery of the keep tower.Espanca, 1975 The DGEMN Direc√ß√£o Geral dos Edif√≠cios e Monumentos Nacionais (General-Directorate for Buildings and National Monuments) began restoration work on the keep tower in 1920. Between 1940 and 1950, the keep tower was used as a support building for the hospital of the Santa Casa da Miseric√≥rdia. During this period, it functioned as an isolation centre for patients infected with tuberculosis. Around 1961, the fortification walls around the parochial residence were in danger of collapse. Further work on repairing the castle structures continued from the 20th century on, with the repair of the walls in 1943, and conservation and consolidation projects to shore-up the structure between 23 and 27 April 1962, including the restoration of the Portas da Ravessa (Gates of Ravessa). Similar projects advanced in 1976 and 1986, including repairs to towers, which were supplemented by efforts of the municipal council of Redondo, that included the repairs of wooden doors and windows of the keep tower and reinforcement of the joints of the Ravessa gate. Architecture The marble coat-of-arms situated at the main gate The castle is situated in an urban location, on the southern flank of the Serra d'Ossa, southwest of the right margin of the Guadiana River. It is located in the town of Redondo, on a hilltop above sea level, with a portion of the town's residential dwellings within its walls, as well as along the cliffs. From the top of the keep tower it is possible to see the Castle of Evoramonte and portions of the Serra d'Ossa, in the northwest. Within the walls the buildings are typical Alentejano architecture, with large rectangular chimneys, single-storey dwellings, white-washed with highlights in ochre and blue. Within the walls and near the keep tower is the Hospital of Santa Casa da Miseric√≥rdia do Redondo and, to the west, the parochial church of Nossa Senhora da Anuncia√ß√£o. The castle is situated along an √âvora defensive line during the medieval period along with the castles of Estremoz, Monsaraz and Portel.

It is classified as a national monument. History Early human occupation of the site dates back to Celtic tribes. During the Roman occupation of the Iberian peninsula, the village was called Mirobriga and included the jurisdiction of Pax Julia (currently Beja) The village was occupied by the Alans during the first decades of the 5th century, then abandoned in the 6th century, when the population relocated to a neighbouring hill nearer to the sea. The new village was successively ruled by the Visigoths, followed by the Moors at the beginning of the second decade of the 8th century, in 712. It was then known as Kassen. =The medieval castle= The castle was built by the moors. During the Iberian peninsula's Reconquista period, Santiago do Cac√©m was taken for the first time in 1157 in the context of the conquest of Alc√°cer do Sal by the forces of Afonso I of Portugal (1112‚Äì1185). The forces of Almohad caliph Abu Yusuf Ya'qub al-Mansur retook the city in 1190‚Äì1191. In 1186, King Sancho I of Portugal awarded the dominions of Almada, Palmela and Alc√°cer do Sal to the Order of Santiago. The first two had previously been reconquered in 1194, whereas the third remained under Moorish control until 1217. That year, under the reign of Afonso II (1211‚Äì1223), Cac√©m became a definitive possession of Portugal. Its domain was given to the knights of the Order, essentially warrior monks, left to rebuild defences. Since this time the village has been known by its current name: Santiago do Cac√©m. Its first charter also dates from this time. Under the reign of Denis of Portugal (1279‚Äì1325), the castle was in the possession of Vata√ßa Lascaris (Dona Vet√°cia), nurse and friend of Queen Elizabeth of Portugal. In the period from 1315 to 1336, the domain was returned to the Order of Santiago. During the 1383‚Äì85 Crisis, Santiago do Cac√©m was one of the first towns to support the Master of Avis, since Fernando Afonso de Albuquerque, Master of Santiago, had made available all of the Order's resources to his cause. In 1512, under the reign of Manuel I of Portugal, the Foral Novo was written (an important document relating regional economic and social history). At the time of the Philippine Dynasty, Philip I of Portugal donated the castle to the dukes of Aveiro (1594). =War of the Restoration to present day= The town lost strategic importance after the Portuguese Restoration War, in the 17th century. The castle and its domain returned to crown control in 1759. The old castle was gradually abandoned and fell to ruin. The site's grounds were used as the town's cemetery in the 19th century. The castle was declared a national monument on 23 June 1910. More recently, the Portuguese DGEMN (Direc√ß√£o Geral dos Edif√≠cios e Monumentos Nacionais) has funded restoration projects. Characteristics =Santiago do Cac√©m Castle= The castle is almost rectangular in shape and there are still some remains of the original Moorish fortification. The walls and battlements were reinforced by ten square towers and semi-cylindrical turrets, externally defended by a barbican, also strengthened by turrets. The ancient church of Santiago is integrated into the south-east part of the wall. Original Romanesque and Gothic architecture can still be seen alongside later styles. Carvings of the saint fighting the Moors can be viewed inside the church. Zoomorphic motifs line the south porch. This part of the medieval citadel comprises remains of the original fortress. Castle legends =Legend of the foundation= At the time of the Moors' occupation, the Lord of the region was a rich Moor who had three children; two boys and a girl. As he grew old and neared death, he called for his children and told them he wished to share his wealth, asking them to do so harmoniously between themselves. Following custom, the eldest son took the lands he desired and the second son acted in the same way with the remaining land. There still remained a vast area of land and wealth for the daughter. The elderly father asked her if she was satisfied with what remained, to which she replied: - Yes, father. But I do not wish for property. I think it is more important for us to have a castle to defend ourselves. Therefore, I only desire the bare land which can be covered by this ox-hide. Before the admiration of her father and brothers, she showed them the ox-hide with which she would delineate the territory of her inheritance. She then cut the skin into thin strips and proceeded to mark the perimeter of the chosen area. Three days of heavy fog followed, at the end of which appeared to all as, if by magic, the Castle of Santiago do Cac√©m. (Adapted from Suplemento Litoral Alentejano, December 1998) =Legend of the Byzantine princess= Another legend tells of a princess called Bata√ßa Lascaris (Vata√ßa Lascaris), who came from the eastern Mediterranean at the head of an armed squadron. She came ashore at Sines, marched south and attacked a Moorish settlement governed by a man named Kassen. The princess took him on in battle, defeating him at the castle of Santiago on 25 July. For this reason, the town became known as Santiago de Kassen. (Adapted from J√∫lio Gil, Os Mais Belos Castelos de Portugal.)

The final reconquest took place in 1199, under King Sancho I, with the help of Frankish Crusaders. Battlements Given its strategic importance, numerous enlargements to the castle were carried out immediately after the reconquest and throughout the Middle Ages. In 1323 a second reinforcement of the walls was made and the West Tower was built, this being needed as a lookout to identify Barbary pirates. In 1384 the castle served as a refuge for John of Avis and his troops during the war with Castile (1383-85). From the fifteenth century, the population gradually began to move down from the hills to settle by the bay and pursue fishing and boatbuilding activities. By 1516 there were already signs of abandonment. The ramparts were reinforced in 1693 and other improvements made and, in 1721, the Church of Santa Maria do Castelo, which was built by Afonso I, was restored. However, the castle was already in a bad condition when it was effectively ruined by the earthquake of 1755. In 1875, part of the grounds was converted into a cemetery. Inside view The advanced state of ruin of the castle was not addressed until between 1933 and 1945, when conservation work was carried out by the Dire√ß√£o-Geral dos Edif√≠cios e Monumentos Nacionais (DGEMN-General Directorate of Buildings and National Monuments). Further restoration was carried out in 1998. The Castle of Sesimbra is now under the management of the Municipality of Sesimbra. The walls can be easily explored on foot and there are also two permanent exhibitions on its history, a shop and a cafeteria.

History The main 12th century fortifications on a bluff above the 13th century walled town The main keep situated in the southwest corner of the walled town A view of the landscape surrounding the castle from the main keep Main gate and the religious nicho to the right The site was probably the location of a pre-existing castro that was Romanized during the Roman epoch. It is considered the oldest constructed Romanesque castle located in the Beira Interior region.Barroca (2000), p.222 The rectangular tower reveals a typology typical of the Roman military architecture, due to its modest dimensions, placement in the center of the courtyard and support by the granite massif.Barroco (2000), p.221 Eighty years later, the first Romanesque Portuguese castles were constructed by the Templars who appropriated the older fortifications that were located near the borders with the Kingdom of Le√≥n and disputed lands in the C√¥a Valley. After a period of abandon, it was re- populated sometime in the 12th century, during the reign of King Sancho.Barroca (2000), p.228 During the reign of his successor (Sancho II), following the model of √âvora the settlement was conceded a Foral and a formal castle was built in 1228. It is likely that the walls were erected after the construction of the keep, around the 14th centuryGomes (1996), p.99 during the sequence of the reforms initiated by King D. Denis (or later by King D. Fernando, during his battles with the Kingdom of Castille). The fact that the town was issued a new foral (under the reign of King D. Sancho II) and received a fair charter (under King D. Denis) proves the regional importance of the locality. In the 15th century, the alcalde of the castle was Manuel Sardinha, who was succeeded by P√™ro Zuzarte. By 1422, there was a reference to approximately 2130 inhabitants living on the hilltop, from the Rol dos Besteiros. But, by the end of that century (1496), the Inquiri√ß√£o identified less than 144 residents on the site. The sites importance was reversed in 1510, with the renovation of the foral by King D. Manuel, who initiated a campaign of public works at the castle, that included the placement of a Manueline emblem over the main gate. In 1522, the alcadery was given to Garcia Zuzarte, then D. Manuel's custodian. In 1527, the town was elevated to seat of royal county under the administration of King D. John III, headed by Lu√≠s da Silveira, his custodian. The Numeramento (royal census) indicated 383 habitantes. The site's importance continued decline, with its military structures repurposed for other military roles and its northwest gate closed- off and the battlements were reconstructed. Starting in 1940, the DGEMN began work to upgrade and maintain the castle and its walls; upgrades to the site included reinforcing the merlons and supporting the toweres and corner walls with reinforced concrete, in addition to re-construction and consolidation of the doorways. As part of the nationalist efforts, between 1942 and 1945, repairs continued with the consolidation of the walls, repair of pavement stone in the cistern, and repairs to the woodframe and doors. These repairs continued in 1951 and 1952, and then later in 1984. As part of the 2000-2001 program to recuperate historic villages, then rombos were reconstructed and pavement along the battlements along the castle perimeter were repaired. Architecture The isolated castle is located in an urban area, implanted on a hilltop between the Serra da Malcata and Serra da Pena, at approximately above sea level. The building overlooks the small town of Sortelha and the valley, with its southern flank comprising inaccessible cliffs. It is integrated into the urban area, totally encircled by a line of fortified walls and situated on the southeastern elevation. Most of the landscape is surrounded by rocky hills, dominated by large granite boulders and medium- elevation shrubbery. To the south of the castle is Cova da Beira, to the west is the Serra da Estrela and Castle of Belmonte, while to the east is a large plateau that demarcated the C√¥a Valley and Sabugal. In front of the castle is the Manuelino pillory. The medieval courtyard is defined by an irregular oval, marked by principal gates, protected by towers, similar to many of the Gothic defenses of the time. During the Manueline constructions, the fortifications transitioned into design supporting canons. The Varanda do Juiz, also known as the Varanda de Pilatos, erected over the northwest gate, came from the Manueline campaign and marked by the royal arms, placed over the arch and varanda. Also, the beginning of the residence was begun (or reformulated) at the time.

Reference to the castle first appears in 1283, from letters of sale between the Infanta D. Leonor Afonso, daughter of King D. Afonso III, discovered by her descendants Pero Anes and D. Jo√£o Peres Aboim. There were indications that a tower had existed near the site of the castle. In the 14th century cartulary of the S√© Cathedral of √âvora, the primitive tower or castle already existed before the construct of the structure known as the Castelo Velho, located on the opposite bank of Ribeira da Valongo on the margins of Alcorovisca. It was Roman mansion along the road. Between the 15th and 16th century, the keep tower was repaired and included pointed tiled roofs, staircase brick and bay windows. In the 19th century, the castle was acquired from the Marquesses of Valada, by their current property-owners. The cracks and faults in the fortifications were cleaned and repaired in 1989, while the fractures were consolidated and reconstructed.

Platform levels  The upper level platforms are divided into a high and a low part. The high part is used by U79 trains which use high-floor light rail cars, the low part by trams of line 903 which are only equipped for low platforms. In the walls behind the tracks, there are several mirrors which lead to the impression that the platform level is larger than it actually is. The lower level is only used by trams in regular service, so there is only a low platform there. At some occasions, also light rail vehicles stopped here; then the movable stairs of these cars were used to allow passengers getting on or off the train.  History  Before the opening of the underground line in Duisburg, trams ran overground on the K√∂nigstra√üe, where they also called at a stop \\"K√∂nig-Heinrich-Platz\\", located above the current underground station. On July 11, 1992, the tram routes in the inner city of Duisburg were replaced by an underground section. At this date, the overground stop was replaced by the underground station.

History A distant perspective of the castle as it looks from the valley A view of the walls and towers from the entranceway The walkway to the top of the keep tower Taken by the Romans in 49 B.C. the castro structure was expanded and successively occupied by Alans and Moors. In 1091, the settlement was conquered by forces loyal to Count D. Henrique. In the course of political expansion and dominion, it was reconquered in the 12th century by D. Afonso Henriques who issued a foral (charter) for new settlers. Around 1163, though, it was donated to Gon√ßalo Mendes de Sousa, alcalde, who reconstructed the structure at his own cost. In 1187, it was donated to the Order of the Knights Templar by King D. Sancho I. This transfer was confirmed in a letter in 1300 by King D. Dinis. But, within a few years (1318) its title was transferred to the Order of Aviz. During this period the important construction of the keep tower, with its crown of merlons, was undertaken. In 1370, during the reign of King D. Ferdinand, the men of Alcanede were free to participate in the work on the castle of Santar√©m, as long as they were able to maintain the walls in Alcanede.Monteiro (1999), p.128 A new foral was issued in 1514 by King D. Manuel, marking a period of prosperity for the town. In addition to the foral, the King also paid for part of the work on the castle and the parochial church, even as the extent of the interventions are largely unknown. On 28 February 1531, the structure was totally destroyed during the course of an earthquake that affected the entirety of the Portuguese Estremadura. Losing much of its military function, the strategic importance decreased and there was little interest by the Crown or Order of Aviz to reconstruct the castle. In 1936 the structure was discovered in a state of almost complete ruin, existing only \\"a few curtain walls in continuous disaggregation and two corners\\".DGEMN (1954), p.16 Work on recuperating and restoring the structure began in 1941 following the same vestiges that existed. Between 1944 and 1949 progress continued on repairing the walls, towers and barbican, including construction of a staircase and the vaulted ceiling in the tower. In 1954 new public works were undertake to consolidate the fortification, which were repeated in 1973, with repairs in the parapets of the walls. As part of a heritage designation, on 1 June 1992, the property was transferred to the possession of the Instituto Portugu√™s do Patrim√≥nio Arquitet√≥nico (Portuguese Institute for Architectural Patrimony) by decree 106F/92 (Di√°rio da Rep√∫blic, S√©rie 1A, 126).

Bruun wrote many books and was the co-author of The Golden Field Guide to Birds of North America first published in 1966. He later became very involved in conservation efforts, most especially in the Middle East where he served as a liaison between the Israel and Egypt to promote the preservation of wildlife in the Sinai Peninsula when the region was handed back to Egypt after the 1978 Camp David Peace Treaty.  Early life  Bruun was born in Skaelskor, Denmark, son to Erik Valdemar Marie Andre Ley Bruun and Ebba Kirstine Poulsen, the youngest of four children. He grew up in the Danish fishing village intending to follow his own father's career as a village doctor. Bruun had grown up in Occupied Denmark during World War II. He took a special pride in the fact that his oldest brother and father were active members of the Danish Resistance.  Career  He attended the University of Copenhagen for his undergraduate studies and medical school, completing his studies there in 1964. He then moved to New York City where he served his internship at Lenox Hill Hospital and residency at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital. He became a practicing neurologist in association with Lenox Hill, Columbia Presbyterian, and Harlem Hospital. Bruun conducted research on the neurological impact of heroin on the human brain in the early 1970s. This led to a very brief stint as medical director of the first heroin treatment facility in New York City, a renegade enterprise organized by the mothers of heroin addicts fed up with the city's inaction to provide a treatment center. He later became head of the Columbia Presbyterian stroke center. = Writing = Bruun's work as an ornithologist coincided with his medical career. He went birding on weekends and vacations, often working in his study to late hours researching his books. He wrote more than fifteen books including two prize-winning children's books‚ÄîThe Human Body and The Brain with his wife Dr. Ruth Bruun. He also co-wrote Common Birds of Egypt‚Äîthe only field guide to birds in that country. Bruun's interest in birds evolved into a passion to use the conservation of wildlife as a bridge for helping advance peace. In the 1970s Bruun became president of the Holy Land Conservation Fund, a non-profit organization based in New York City that was set up to help support wildlife preservation efforts in Israel. Bruun sought to expand the work in Israel to the fuller mission of advancing conservation in the Middle East. Birding moved from being a benign activity to hazardous duty. In 1978 he was in Tehran when the Shah of Iran was overthrown, leaving the country shortly before the Shah's downfall in an armored personnel carrier. While helping to advance peace between Israel and Egypt, his work posed a threat to violent groups who opposed the peace treaty.  Later life  Bruun retired as a neurologist in 1989, having suffered several strokes. He started small business buying and selling toy soldiers called The March of Time. He subsequently wrote a definitive guide to the niche industry called The Toy Soldiers Identification and Price Guide in 1994.

History The territory of \\"Alan Cana\\" was conquered in 714 by Muslims, who established a fortress (alca√ßova). To the north are two rectangular towers, whose lines demonstrate Muslim influences, but without direct connection to Muslim architecture. Following two months of siege, D. Afonso Henriques' forces took the fortress and likely began repairs on the fortifications, while settling partisans within the territory. By the first half of the 13th century, the castle was one of the important defensive structures in the north of Lisbon. In 1211, King D. Sancho I constructed a royal palace and donated it to his daughter, Sancha, who would eventually take refuge there following a disagreement with her brother, the Infante D. Afonso II (who disagreed with their fathers gifting of the castle). She officially began living in Alenquer beginning in 1212, at which time D. Afonso II encircled the castle. In order to resolve the dispute between the siblings, Pope Innocence III placed the castle in charge of the Knights Templar in 1216, proving the military relevance of the structure at that time. The castle's proprietorship passed in 1340, to D. Const√¢ncia, wife of King D. Pedro I. At the beginning of this period, Alenquer began to be an integral part of the patrimony of the Portuguese Queens, being successively donated to sovereigns of the Kingdom. The work to build the structure were primarily instigated in the 14th century, by Queen Isabel when she began visiting the village. The majority of artefacts from the castle's construction indicate a chronological distinction during this Gothic period. The oval plan and keep tower addorsed to the walls were highlights of this style. The walls were covered by protected embattlements with rectangular merlons, and near the river, constructed as a defensive link to water resources was the \\"Torre da Coura√ßa\\". It is likely that these high structures were later to the castle and highly modified within the progressing years. In 1384, Castilian forces take Alenquer, forcing the Master of Aviz, John I of Castile to lay siege to the fortress. After a period, the alcalde, Vasco Pires de Cam√µes surrendered the fortifications, but as a reprisal for the former-alcalde's conspiracy against him, he ordered the removal of the cornerstones of the keep tower and lowered the walls. It was only by 1439 that, continuing in the possession of the Queens of Portugal, D. Leonor Teles ordered that the walls be raised. Sometime around 1578, the castle cistern fell into ruin. Following the allegiance shown by the town of Alenquer to D. Ant√≥nio, Prior of Crato, in his struggle to maintain the Portuguese throne, little support was given to maintain the castle. Falling into ruin, the population began using the stones from the wall to fabricate their own homes. In 1740, though, a small chapel was constructed over the Nossa Senhora da Concei√ß√£o Gate. Ten years later, the Royal Academy and King Joseph I of Portugal recommended the conservation of the military grounds. But, these efforts were in vain: in 1755, the Lisbon earthquake caused the destruction of the two tower gates. Similarly, following the Battle of Bu√ßaco in 1810, the castle suffered damage, due to the garrisoning of troops associated with the Lines of Torres Vedras. In the 19th century, the need to open a gateway between the Nossa Senhora da Concei√ß√£o Gate and square, obliged the municipal authority to destroy part of the lower wall. In 1927, archaeologist Hip√≥lito Caba√ßo, proceed with clearing of the cistern, and recovered objects that permitted dating of the structure. Similar excavations in 1940 alongside the Nossa Senhora da Concei√ß√£o Gate allowed archeologists to prove the existence of a prehistoric settlement on the site. As part of the archeological recovery of the site, the DGMEN demolished the chapel over the Gate, and proceeded to partially restore the walls, but the project was incomplete, and it remained unfinished. Architecture The castle is situated in the urban centre, over the remains of the primitive Muslim fortress, at the highest point of the town surrounded by forest. Alongside the former Jewish quarter, the castle walls encircle the urban area to the Nossa Senhora da Concei√ß√£o Gate and the corridor towers. The interior is marked by a spring/fountain. Little remains of the primitive fortress except some walls. The castle has a long, irregular plan that follows the morphology of the terrain and by the urban organization, in addition to the rest of primitive fortress. Of its original fortifications, only the northwest perimeter exists, in addition to a segment in the north and around the tower. The curtain of walls to the north includes three rectangular towers, with two arched doorways. The left tower, with strong lower backstop, along with the one in the northeast, are surmounted by terrace and parapets, and the right by rectangular construction with tile roof and small belfry. The Gothic castle in Alenquer was organized into two enclosures: an upper courtyard, that conformed to the topography of the terrain, where the Muslim alc√°ova existed; and the inferior terrace that covered a much wider area, that protected the primitive urban agglomeration. Of the various stages of development little is known. It is presumed that the first structure was the Muslim fortification and settlement, and that after it was conquered in 1148, a new wave building began, such as in Lisbon, Sintra, Almada and Palmela at the time. The castle fortifications are accessible by arched doorway. The curtain of walls are crowned by rectangular merlons and lined by battlements, in some areas protected by parapets. The main rectangular tower extends above the river, connected by a corridor to defend the walls. Both structures were reused for housing, and the walls incorporated into local constructions.

History What remains of the castle of Alfeizer√£o is still undocumented with any rigor, or accompanied by archaeological references. The strategic relevance of the locality to the birth of the Kingdom of Portugal, its expansion to the south in the middle of the 12th century, certainly determined its importance. About from S√£o Martinho do Porto, and it is the principal defensive point between Peniche and Nazar√©, sheltering a small port. Following the conquest of the Arab stronghold in the 12th century, the fortifications were reconstructed in 1147 by troops loyal to D. Afonso Henriques. The castle was sited on a hilltop, over the coast and guarding an extensive region above the sea. The castle defended the coast along with the Fort of S√£o Miguel (along the promontory of Nazar√©) and the Fortress of Peniche (from the peninsula of Peniche), between the silt sandbar of the port. There are scarce references to the life of the castle, in particular during the height of its operation, in the early Middle Ages, but its decline has been documented, along with the decline of the port. In the 16th century, it was a maritime entrepot with the capacity to shelter 80 ships, but the intervening centuries saw its slow erosion.Almeida (1946) On 1 November 1755, the Lisbon earthquake destroyed the castle and little effort was made to reconstruct the military outpost, thereby beginning a slow period of degradation and abandon. By 1951, the castle was part of the property of J√∫lio Ferraz from Caldas da Rainha. A proposal to clean up the space, consolidate the ruins and begin archaeological investigation on the site was communicated in 1973. In partnership with the local Junta Nacional de Educa√ß√£o (National Junta for Education), on 21 June 1974, there was a proposal to classify the walls of the abandoned castle as an Im√≥vel de Interesse P√∫blico (Property of Public Interest). On 19 January 2007, a proposal was made by the DRCLVTejo to establish the fort within a Special Protection Zone that included the ruins of the castle and pillory of Alfeizer√£o, that was accepted by the IPA (on 26 June 2007) and Consultory Council of IGESPAR (on 31 October 2007).

It is encircled by the town of Alfeizer√£o to the east and west, and by a fertile plain in the remainder. The vestiges of this castle are covered in dense vegetation. Although slowly eroded, there are still segments of the wall, composed of Opus isodomum, that connected the semi-circular corbels/towers. The courtyard was likely rectangular, defended by eight towers and an isolated keep tower, slightly off-centre from the eastern edge (oriented towards land). In one of these corbels is a geodesic marker.

History Dominating the mountaintop of the territory of the Baixo Alentejo, the walls that encompass Aljustrel were once occupied since the Neolithic and Chalcolithic, with the latter evidence in the fragments of flint and ceramics discovered at the site. This primary phase was succeeded by a hiatus, and there are no materials leading to a proto-historic or Roman period of occupation. It is unclear when the structure was used in a military capacity, but there are suggestions that it began during the late Muslim occupation, around the 13th century, at the time of the fortress of Alc√°cer do Sal.Correia (1992), p.69 Sometime between the 8th and 12th century, the castle was built by Arab inhabitants using taipa construction, possibly in the location of a fortified Romanized castro. An archaeological investigation revealed materials dating until the 9th century,Ramos, Martins, Muralha and Estorninho (1993), p.15 that attest to the importance of the castle to the Muslim civilization in the southwest part of the peninsula. The reconquest of Aljustrel by Portuguese forces, 1234, marked the beginning of a new era for the castle. In 1235, King D. Sancho II of Portugal donated the fortifications to the Order of Santiago, which was later sanctioned by his successor, King D. Afonso III in 1255. The castle was not the only fortification to be added to the immediate defensive lines, many of the Muslim strongholds along the Algarve were incorporated into the Crown's possessions, including the mines at Aljustrel. The presence of D. Paio Peres Correia, Master of the Order of Santiago was, therefore, not unusual to the wider expansion of the Kingdom, since it became a staging ground for further attacks to the south, during the 13th century. There are no records of what changes were made to the castle by Christian forces during this period. Shortly following, with the conquest of the Algarve, Aljustrel lost much of its important strategic relevance and the fort began to fall into ruin. Little remained of the walls, except the local name (derived from the Arabic) and the Christian church that was established nearby. Architecture The castle is situated on an isolated hilltop, some above sea level, dominated by a panoramic view of the nearby landscape, near the Church of Nossa Senhora do Castelo. There are few traces of the foundations, in masonry stone, nor of the original taipa construction left by the Arab settlers. Most of the older Muslim foundations are located in the northwest, southeast and northeast quadrants, while part of the wall that bisects the stairs are part of the later castle structure.

History The territory of Arronches was first conquered in 1166 by forces loyal to D. Afonso Henriques. Yet, over the course of the intervening years the location alternated between Muslim and Christian forces, with King D. Sancho II taking it in 1235, and in 1242, troops of D. Paio Peres Correia finally reconquered Arronches. On 16 June 1255, a foral (charter) was issued by King D. Afonso III, which was confirmed on 2 January 1272. In 1310, the lands of Arronches was incorporated into Crown territories by King D. Dinis, who ordered the reconstruction of the castle. Following the Castilian invasion, in 1384, troops of D. Nuno √Ålvares Pereira retook the castle and lands of Arronches. The first Cortes of Arronches convened in 1475. On 1 June 1512, a new foral was issued by King D. Manuel I. King D.

During the sequence of Wars of Independence, in 1640, the castle was integrated into the primary lines of defensive of Portugal. Ultimately, in 1661 John of Austria conquered Arronches during the course of the Portuguese Restoration War, but, two years later, there was an explosion in the powder magazine which damaged castle. Within the year there was a move to dismantle the fortifications by the Spanish forces. With the restoration, on 25 July 1678, King Afonso VI conceded a new foral. In 1712, the castle resisted a Castilian attack. Combat at Arronches occurred in 1801.

Afonso I donated the town, for his efforts in taking Lisbon. As a result, on 1167, a foral (charter) was issued by D. Afonso. From that donation and subsequent settlement efforts, as well as organization of the territory, that the castle was built. In 1187, at the time of a new foral, Antougia was mentioned as having a military structure, and alluded to the need for further defensive structures that integrated watchtowers. During the reign of King D. Sancho I, on 1191, following the death of all the friars in the convent from the Black Death, the possessions of S√£o Juli√£o were incorporated into the Convent of Alcoba√ßa. In 1218, the foral was confirmed by D. Afonso II in Santar√©m. It is unclear whether the fortress was refurbished at this time. During the 14th century, King D. Dinis initiated public works on the castle after donating the town to his alcalde, Queen D. Isabel. Between 1373 (or 1376) the Cortes are celebrated in the reign of King D. Ferdinand. A law to regulate the jurisdiction of Donataries, that provided various privileges, including navigation and commerce in the kingdom was passed in 1376. In 1510, a new foral was issued from Sant√°rem for Atouguia by King D. Manuel of Portugal. Until 1526, the region was known at Touguia, Tauguia or Touria (named for the bulls that roamed in Crown lands), but adopted its formal title \\"Atouguia da Baleia\\" following the beaching of a whale in the beach of Areia Branca. The lands of Antougia passed from the Crown of Portugal in 1759 to the donataries of the Counts of Atouguia. But, King Joseph I extinguished the countship of Antougia that year following the attempted regicide.

History Sometime during the Iron Age the territory of Av√¥ was occupied by a primitive Castro culture, that was much later taken-over by the Romans. The site was an important link in the Roman road network, connecting Lancia Oppidana and Con√≠mbriga. In 412, the settlement was settled by the Alans. It was taken in 716 by Muslim forces. In the 11th century, the settlement was part of the possessions of the Count of Coimbra, Sesnando Davides. D. Henrique donated Av√¥ to the Bishop of Coimbra in the 12th century. It was likely his son, D. Afonso Henriques who ordered to construction of the first medieval fortress over the ruins of the Roman settlement. By 1187, the town pertained to D. Urraca Afonso, illegitimate daughter of Afonso Henriques, who traited it for Aveiro, from her brother D. Sancho I. It was King Sancho who conceded the foral (charter), confirming it in the hands of the Bishop of Coimbra. In the 13th century, the castle was destroyed during battles between D. Sancho II and Afonso III. A century later, it was reconstructed by King D. Dinis (from the vestiges uncovered on the site). From 1856, the castle ruins began to deteriorate rapidly, with much of the stone reused in public works, including the construction of the bridge crossing the Ribeira de Moura. The keep tower was ultimately disassembled. On 1 June 1992, the property was placed in the hands of the Instituto Portugu√™s do Patrim√≥nio Arquitet√≥nico (Portuguese Institute of Architectural Patrimony), by decree 106F/92 (Di√°rio da Rep√∫blica, S√©rie 1A, 126).

History The settlement of Barbacena was definitively reconquered by King D. Sancho II, in the first half of the 13th century. The settlement of the site, which possibly developed from a pre-Roman castro, developed from its gift to D. Est√™v√£o Anes, chancellor of King D. Afonso III (who was married to the illegitimate daughter of the monarch, and Master of Alvito in 1251. The first foral was signed by its new master in 1273, still in the reign of King Afonso. During the reign of King D. John I, there is reference to two partisan noblemen, Jo√£o Fernandes Pacheco and Martim Afonso de Melo. The latter was the king's bodyguard () and alcalde of √âvora, to whom was later granted the lordship of Barbacena. Jo√£o Fernandes Pacheco, who was a supporter of the Master of Avis, lost this and other lordships for betraying the King, and Barbacena was given to Martim Afonso de Melo. On 15 December 1519, D. Manuel I provided the town with a new foral, ordering the re-construction of the castle, which it can be assumed was in a bad state of repair. A few years later, in 1536, Barbacena was a ' of D. Jorge Henriques, huntsman to King D. John III, to whom was attributed the beginning of the construction of the castle, but this terminated on the death of its founder, in 1572. Three years later, the fortification was purchased by Diogo de Castro do Rio, Knight in the Order of Christ and Nobleman in the Royal House, who was the first to use the title Master of Barbacena. At this time, the castle was already erected, following a rectangular layout, on the site of a previous medieval project. It was short-lived: in 1587, the was once again auctioned off to Martim de Castro, under the condition of removing the two corbels and the keep tower. In the 17th century, during the context of the Restoration Wars, the fortress underwent public works in order to improve its strategic worth, resulting in the construction of a modern bastion. The principal entranceway, which included a stone portico and frontispiece with sculpted pinnacles, was constructed during this era. In 1645, Castilian forces assaulted the castle and in 1658 the garrison was forced to surrender to the Duke of Ossuna. Constant attacks and pillaging, as well as a need to modernize its defenses and improve its strategic worth, resulted in moves by Afonso Furtado de Mendon√ßa (the king's chancellor and first Viscount of Barbacena, great- grandson of Diogo de Castro do Rio) to elaborate new plans. New attacks on the bastion then occurred, by the Marqu√™s of Bay, governor of Badajoz, during the War of the Spanish Succession. Barbacena was actually besieged several times in the 19th century, and its proximity to Spain was a cause of considerable instability, due to Spanish incursions. Of the original rectangular castle, there are remains of the walls and principal entrance, in addition to vestiges of the arched old gate (which was covered over). The fortification walls were transformed in the 17th century into a star-shaped bastion, with several of the walls and barbicans remaining. The keep tower was destroyed at the beginning of the 17th century. Still visible is the House of the Governor (), a nobleman's residence, with central staircase and vestiges of a chapel on the upper floor. The castle continued in the same family for several years. In 1816, King D. John VI created the title of Count of Barbacena, to the benefit of Lu√≠s Ant√≥nio Furtado de Castro do Rio de Mendon√ßa e Faro, 1st Count and 6th Viscount of Barbacena. His son, Francisco Furtado de Castro do Rio de Mendon√ßa, 2nd Count and 7th Viscount of Barbacena, continued to live at the castle. In 1896, as recorded in a property notice, Hermenegildo Jos√© Costa Campos sold it to Alfredo de Andrade, whose descendant Jos√© Luis Sommer de Andrade, sold it in 2005 to Mico da C√¢mara Pereira. In 1974, the fortifications were occupied by the population of Barbacena. Architecture The site consists of a garrison castle within a star-shaped bastion fortress. The bastion fortress consists of an arrow-shaped revelim (with entrance to the southwest), a half bastion, recessed walls and two middle bastions (interconnected by advanced arrow-shaped revelim) with guardhouse. The rectangular-shaped castle includes battlements that circle the rooftops that were transformed into simple parapets. On the eastern walls are rectangular bastions, while opposite to these are large circular towers, with vaulted ground and top floors that incorporate window slits (some horizontal). The courtyard has central cistern, two abandoned cannons and annex buildings. To the east, is the House of the Governor, a two-story building serviced by a central staircase that connects the ground floor to the circular tower (on the outer wall). On the upper floor (in the north) are traces of a chapel integrated into the battlement and house's wall. The main gate includes rectangular masonry mould, with framing pilasters and pediment with decorative base relief features. The old door, with moulded bases, has a semicircular stone arch within a rectangular frame and an architrave supporting two pinnacles () flanking a rectangular niche.

History There are many interpretations as to the construction of the palace of Curutelo. F√©lix Machado, in his notes on the nobility of the Count of S√£o Pedro, stated that the structure existed during the time of Ferdinand I of Le√≥n who conquered Coimbra from the Moors, and gave it to Nuno Nudiz. Jo√£o Salgado de Ara√∫jo, Abbey of Perre, indicates that it was constructed by the Asturian nobleman Alarico (powerful descendant of the Goths) around 800. The building remained in the inheritance of his descendants until D. Urraca Landufes, who married Nuno Nudiz. Figueiredo Guerra indicates that the building was erected in 1532, by Jo√£o Rodrigues do Lago, and that there was no castle at the time that Nuno Viegas and his wife, In√™s Dias, instituting the Majorat, which was later confirmed by D. Jo√£o I on 14 December 1395. Figueiredo da Guerra suggests that the estate palace was built in the first half of the 16th century.,Figueiredo da Guerra (1925) and followed a typology inspired by the medieval tower-residence. A document dating from 1395 identified that Nuno Viegas do Rego and his wife, In√™s Dias, established a vineyard in the Quinta de Coucieiro and Quinta de Curutelo, for his son √Ålvaro Viegas. At the time, there was no indication or reference of a castle or tower. The majorat was confirmed by King D. Jo√£o I in December of the same year. During the stewardship of the 5th Majorat of Coucieiro, around 1532, the lands were sold to Duke D. Jaime, becoming the owner of the residence, tower, castle and estate of Curutelo. He eventually called on the nobleman Jo√£o Rodrigues de Lago (son of Rui Gomes) to render services and conquer Azamar, resulting in the estate becoming the possession of his descendant in the following centuries. Following the marriage of D. Maria de Felgueiras Gajo with Dr. Rodrigo Augusto Cerqueira Velozo (a Barcelos lawyer) in 1867, work was begun on modernizing the tower, that included opening spaces for new windows and doors. Yet, not having any heirs, before her death, D. Maria Felgueiras Gajo, named her husband as benefactor, resulting in litigation in the courts, that ultimately sided with Dr. Rodrigo Velozo. In 1902, the Esposende capitalist and former merchant of Porto, Valentim Ribeiro da Fonseca purchased the estate. Architecture The structure is situated in a harmonious, rural landscape, half-way up the mount of S√£o Crist√≥v√£o dos Milagres, also known as S√£o Crist√≥v√£o do Curutelo, overlooking a small valley covered in forest. It is encircled by a high wall, with ivy-covered, rectangular gated access alongside the roadway. Similar to many of the manor- houses in the Alto Minho constructed in the 16th century, the palace of Curutelo combines the symmetry and regularity of the civil architecture associated with the Renaissance, with medieval keep tower, which at the time had a defensive function, symbolizing the nobility and power of property- owners. Its plan focuses on a single-story rectangular section, that includes a central, elevated square tower. The main body of the building is crowned by pyramidal merlons, with gargoyles situated along regular spaces on the facade. In comparison, the frontispiece is austere, with a few regular guillotine- style windows and doors with simple frames. In the courtyard of the estate is a chapel dedicated to Santo Amaro, with a simple typology similar to the manor-house. It has a simple facade, divided into two registers by friezes, with simple rectangular frame surmounted by window, and accompanied by a truncated, rectangular bell-tower. The interior of this single-nave church includes a high-choir and presbytery in gilded woodwork.

History Tradition suggest that the estate was constructed in 798, after D. Afonso, \\"o Casto\\", of Castille defeat the Mouros in the battle of Lamas. At the beginning of the 12th century, a foral (charter) was issued to the parish of Ferreira de Aves, by Queen D. Teresa. From this period until the 14th century, the lands of Ferreira de Aves pertained to the Pacheco family; in 1126, Paio Fernandes Pires, founder of the Pacheco family, signed a contract with the town of Ferreira de Aves, turning his family into its first signeurial dynasty in the region. In 1156, half the town belong to the Knights Templar, even as they had only arrived in the territory for a short time.Pinho Leal (1874), p.172 The village of Lamas was named during the 1258 Inquiri√ß√µes (Inquiries) of King D. Afonso III. A notice between 1331 and 1332 appeared in records, of D. Lopo Fernandes Pacheco, rich honourable man and seigneur of Ferreira (in the Nobili√°rio do Conde D. Pedro) e and his wife D. Maria Gomes Taveira, who discovered themselves in Pa√ßo de Ferreira. The hereditary fiefdom and possessions of the Pachecos would be confiscated in 1385, following Jo√£o Fernandes Pacheco having allied himself with Castilians forces during the Portuguese Interregnum. The lands and properties of the Pacheco clan were forfeited to the knight, Rui Vasques Coutinho, until 1433. Similarly, on 12 April 1398, King D. John I ordered the confiscation of further possessions of Pachecos, that included the seigneurial titles and lands in Ferreira de Aves. Ultimately, by the end of the 14th century, all lands of Ferreira would be donated to Rui Vasques Coutinho. In August 1451, in the terms of a letter of donation, King D. Afonso V, Martim Afonso de Melo obtained de jure and descendancy, the seigneurial title to Ferreira. Changes to the estate began in the 15th century, resulting in the opening of the off-centre entranceway and the upper floors, along with the twined freises. In 1504, D. Rodrigo Afonso de Melo, son of Martim Afonso de Melo and, inheritor of the town of Ferreira de Aves, among others, received the title of Count of Tent√∫gal, created by King D. Manuel I. The 1527 Cadastro da Popula√ß√£o do Reino (Population Cadastre of the Kingdom or official census), the settlement of Lamas was identified as the most populous centre in the municipality. Sometime in the 1530s, the Counts of Tent√∫gal received the title of Marques of Ferreira, by King D. John III. In August 1537, D. √Ålvaro, direct descendant of the first Marquess prematurely died, resulting in his son requesting the title for himself. But, this was not the case, and in 1548 the family line obtained the title of Dukes of Cadaval. On 27 April 1567, the visitor to Ferreira de Aves ordered the administrator of the chapel of S√£o Miguel to purchase of a chalice, an image of the Archangel Michael and repair the altar footstool. During a visit by Bishop Jorge de Ata√≠de on 3 November 1577, the chapel administrator was obliged to line the chapel, construct a portico and install new ceiling tile. He was also obliged to acquire new altar linens. On 6 June 1581, King D. Philip bestowed on the uncle of the claimant (D. Francisco de Melo), the title of Marques of Ferreira. On 26 October 1598, the Countess of Tent√∫gal, D. Mariana de Castro donated the Chapel of S√£o Miguel, in the interior of the estate to Baltasar Esta√ßo, servant to her brother, D. Jo√£o de Bragan√ßa, who was incapable following the death of Aires de Botelho. In 1630, the chapel was in ruin, resulting in public works to restore the former enclave lasting into 1633. Several years later, in 1657, the chapel was also repaired with donations coming from D. Ant√≥nio de Almeida, but by 1670, the visitor ordered the construction of a new chapel. In the 18th century, the estate was described as encircled by lands cultivated with rye, corn, wheat, sweet chestnut and oak trees. Around the houses were the chapel of Nossa Senhora da Ajuda, and near the ravine, the Chapel of S√£o Miguel, patronized by the masters of Ferreira. The chapel had a presbytery supported by 50 simple, annual masses and two oratories, for which it received 254 alqueires of rye and 14 chickens in payment. By 1702, this meager supported allowed, along with donations the renovation of the retable of the chapel. In 1898, the chapel dedicated to Nossa Senhora do Amparo was re edified by order of D. Maria da Piedade Caetano √Ålvares Pereira de Melo, 7th Duchess of Cadaval, 9th Marquess of Ferreira and 10th Countess of Tent√∫gal. By March 1973, the estate of lands were sold to Herm√≠nio Marques Ferreira. The new property owner was responsible for refurbishing the interiors, updating the ceiling and tile and placement of tile in the upper section. Architecture The estate house is situated in a rural area, in a terraced area. The old tower is an archaic feature, addorsed to modern constructions, accessible from an enclosed patio. The group is part of a cultivated area, encircled in the north and west by ditch or moat. The medieval tower has a rectangular plan, consisting of two floors, circled by two ditches or moats, with a structure that is practical and less decorative. It is marked by window slits, with monolithic lintel, with a Gothic-like portico with semi-spheres, revealing successive alterations to the structure and decoration. Its robust construction implies a building whose purpose was likely defensive. The rectangular plan has a vertical disposition covered in ceiling tile: it evolved into a two-story structure, with the ground floor buttressed by irregular cornerstones. The principal facade is oriented by the arched portico, with smooth imposed lines, forming six staves, with chamfered and decorated in spheres, elements that are also repeated in the jambs. A pair of twinned freises with pointed arches decorate the second floor. The blind south facade is addorsed to a modern building, with an archaic facade. The western facade is broken by an embrasure, a little above the ground, surmounted by a pair of twin freises. The northern facade includes window slits on the lower floor, with five machillactons and a pair of twinned friezes on the upper floor. The interior includes a distinct division that occupies the first floor, with wooden ceiling. The first floor has one division only, with staircase that connects to the upper floor made of wood. The second floor has two divisions in wood.

History A view of the circular plan of the walled citadel The castle was constructed in 1183, likely built over the ruins of a former-Lusitanian castro, by men under the orders of King D. Sancho I. Vestiges of the ancient castro were subsumed in the beginning of the 20th century. In 1187, King Sancho would issue a Foral (charter) for Folgosinho, that would be reconfirmed during the reign of King D. Afonso II (in 1217), then in 1350 by King D. Denis. But, its construction is debated by Portuguese archaeologists. In the beginning of the 20th century, some investigators recognized primitive vestiges of the primitive medieval castle, which they attribute to the actions of D. Sancho I. Unfortunately, it can not be confirmed, especially since multiple archaeological excavations suggest a medieval origin. What is clear, is that Folgosinho did not constitute part of the primary lines of conquest and military delineation of the national territory, but rather as part of a wider settlement strategy. But, even these require further documentation. Over the centuries, military documentation is non-existent, and most references associated with the forals passed by D. Afonso II, D. Dinis and D. Manuel, with little evidence on the preponderance of control or management of the territory. By the 15th century, the castle was part of the possessions of the Sousa family in the district. At this time, around 1512, a new foral was conceded by King D. Manuel. Owing to the number of forals issued to the town and hinterland, the lands of Folgosinho were considered Terra de El - Rei, and were given to Donatary-Captains, the included the Marqueses of Arronches, the Dukes of Laf√µes and the Counts of Miranda do Corvo. Furthermore, the lands of Folgosinho were constituent parts of the commandery of the Order of Christ. Following the administrative reorganization of the kingdom, in 1836, Folgosinho ceased to be the seat of the municipality, and Gouveia became that administrative centre. At the middle of the 20th century, the castle was classified as a Property of Public Interest, initiating a phase of reexamination, that would ultimately lead to it being a regional tourist attraction. By 1938-1939, the civil parish authority began work on reconstructing the castle. But, when the civil parish of Folgosinho indicated their intention to reconstruct the castle, the monument was already in ruin. Architecture One of the watchtowers on the top of the tower overlooking the town of Folgosinho The castle is situated in an urban context, along the edges of the agglomerated townscape, on the top of hill consisting of white and red quartz, on the flanks of the Serra dos Galhardos, overlooking the valley of Mondego. The castle has a circular plan, with a lower masonry wall and superior wall in stonework, with a slightly elevated and deep adarve. The perimeter of the wall is interrupted in the west by an access to the courtyard, a square keep tower in the east (with corbels) and, in the north, a gate with lintel and bell preceded by protruding frieze and surmounted by small rectangular merlons. It also includes three cylindrical guaritas, with door in broken arches and rectangular merlons. Within in the interior of the castle is a geodesic marker.

This period was responsible for the group of edifices and courtyards, platforms, slopes and ramps. Sometime between 1300 and 1200 B.C., the monument was reduced to stone, either intentionally or ritualized, and left abandoned, in particular the outer zones. In 1987, A.N. S√° Coix√£o planted eucalyptus in the locality, following several surveys and field studies. But, two years later, Susana Oliveira Jorge initiated excavations in the locality. The castle was transferred to the management of the IPPAR, by CELBI (STORA) in the 1990s. This move lead to the 28 September 1998 dispatch to begin a process of classification of the site, supported by Susana Oliveira Jorge. In 2004, further archaeological excavations and consolidation of the structures began in 2004, with construction of reception/interpretative centre built to allow visitors to visit the site. The site was open to the public in 2007.

The old castle dominates the landscape on Monte de S√£o Gabriel and, in the background the Meseta and Serra da Marofa. In most directions, except the north and northwest, the hilltop has natural defense conditions. At the limit is a courtyard constructed in masonry schist, consolidated mortar, with various openings and small random, semi-circular structures. In the interior, there is a circular platform consisting of various, small stone structures. Outside the enclosure are small walls and ramps in clay and shale that take advantage of rocky outcrops.

History Detail of the exterior walls showing the crenellations Outside the exterior walls on the sloping terrace are a second series of walls The southeast gate to the Castle of Pombal, seen from the interior From outside the walls, two of the rectangular windows common to the late history of the castle Around 1128, the Castle of Pombal, site of a former Roman castro and Arab fortress, was donated to the Knights Templar by Afonso Henriques in order to defend Coimbra, and which included a vast territory of land. The transfer of its control at this time, was seen as an important military position, owing to its successive generations of fortification and disputes between Christian and Muslim forces. The construction of the Romanesque fortress began in the middle of the 12th century (in either 1155 or 1156), and continued practically until the century's end; the construction of various towers was made to serve, stabilize and reinforce the wall, and help to repopulate the town.Barroca (2000), p.360 It is likely that work started on the encirclement of the position and later to the construction of the keep (around 1171), and includes an alambor, a defensive feature to mitigate attacks close to the walls. In 1171, the keep was constructed in the castle courtyard; during this period of the passive Reconquista, the keep served as the last defensive bastion, acting as the Lord lieutenants personal stronghold. At the conclusion of the project an inscription was carved over the door to the keep, something promoted by D. Gualdim Pais in the medieval period, while in 1353, the castle and village were donated to the Order of Christ. The plaque was later removed and deposited in the Convent of Christ in Tomar Municipality, on request of Prince Henry the Navigator (between 1420 and 1460). Little changed during the early Middle Ages to the Romanesque fortification, and only re-thinking of its battlements were identified in the reign of Manuel I of Portugal, which included the definition of the barbican and reinforcement of the medieval walls. A similar reconstruction of the Church of Santa Maria do Castelo began in 1560, under the alcalde Pedro de Sousa Ribeiro, an antecedent of the Count of Castelo-Melhor, who held the governorship since the reign of Afonso V until 1834.Leal (1876) The castle lost its military importance during the modern era, and was attacked by French forces during the Napoleonic Peninsular War. French troops commanded by General Ney caused sevre damage to the castle during the peninsular invasion in 1811. The following year, the baptismal fountain was transferred from the Church of Santa Maria do Castelo to the Church of S√£o Martinho. Although partially restored in the 20th century, most of the settlement began to concentrate along the flanks of the hilltop or lowlands. In 1923, a formal request was sent by the Municipal Council of Pombal to the Ministry of War () soliciting the transfer of the Castle to their authority. The following year, on 7 December 1924, the castle was given by the same ministry to the N√∫cleo da Uni√£o dos Amigos dos Monumentos da Ordem de Cristo em Pombal do Castelo. The transfer included land in the village and ancillary terrains, that constituted Military Camp No.1: \\"in the municipal square the transfer of the ruins of the castle to the N√∫cleo, demarcated by 32 stone markers, numbered successively from the north to south, from the east, and numbered with the abbreviations M.G....To the N√∫cleo went the responsibility to conserve and guard the property, with the assistance of the Ministry of War, when necessary; the concession and title was free, with indefinite time limit, while property remained in the hands of the Ministry; the N√∫cleo was forbidden to perform whatsoever remodelling, even recuperations that involved demolish or new constructions in masonry, or movements of land in the esplanades, without a written license from the Ministry of War\\". This contract persisted until 1931, when the N√∫cleu was dissolved: the concession was transferred to the Comiss√£o de Iniciativa e Turismo de Pombal (Pombal Commission for Initiatives and Turismo). In the years preceding the Portuguese World Exposition in 1940, there were several initiatives to restore or recuperate the site. In 1933, a request to construction a roadway to connect the Castle to Pombal, which was authorized and registered by the Ministry of War. A similar request was sent to the Ministry in 1934, that proposed the planting of trees and landscaping, which was approved by the executive commission of the Municipal Council and authorized by the Conselho Superior de Belas Artes. In 1936, the stone masonry was repaired and the walls were reconstructed to match those that existed. Similarly, in 1937, more repairs were completed on the walls, including the corners, chemin de ronde, parapets in the southern facade; reconstruction of the stoneworks, chemin de ronde, vaulted arches on the southern and western facade; construction of the roof frame in the keep; construction of pavements and staircase, between the floors of the keep; replacement of the exterior gates; and excavations in the military square. This continued into 1938 with the reconstruction of walls to a state comparable to its original construction; the complete reconstruction of the southern barbican, including the consolidation of the crenelations, battlements and staircases to better resemble its original state. On 13 April 1939, the Castle was transferred to the Ministry of Finances (). By the time of its transfer, the castle was in a state of ruin, and included an ancillary terrain, covering , at the time equivalent to 200.000$00escudos. The castle included walls and barbicans, as well as the main tower/keep, marked by a public road to the north. The site was only electrified in 1956, while \\"festive\\" lighting was installed in 1959, by the Servi√ßos dos Monumentos Nacionais (National Monument Services), in collaboration with the Municipal Council. The exterior and interior walls were cleaned in 1970, with cement reinforcement of the chemin de ronde, reinforcement of the joints and repairs to the main gate. Likewise, around 1975, the pavement and coverings in the keep were redone, including access stairs; repairs to the second-floor staircase and the construction of a protective covering; the second and third-floors were re-tiled; while the main floor and main gate were cleaned and repaired. Around 2000-2001, the keep was reassessed with repairs undertaken. In 2004, the Municipal Council of Pombal presented a project to requalify and revalorize the Castle and its grounds, which at the time was being studied by the IPPAR Instituto Portugu√™s do Patrim√≥nio Arquitect√≥nico (Portuguese Institute for Architectural Patrimony).Di√°rio das Beiras (16 August 2004) Comparably, in 2005, the main keep was converted into a museum. In November, of the same year, a risk assessment for the castle was undertaken by the DGEMN Direc√ß√£o Geral dos Edif√≠cios e Monumentos Nacionais (General-Directorate for Buildings and National Monuments). Architecture The large gate located in the northwest of the castle with royal coat-of-arms, armillary sphere and cross The double- window with carved coat of arms for the Sousa Ribeiro The rural castle is located on an elevated hilltop overlooking the town of Pombal, on the right margin of the River Arunca. Alongside its accessway is also located the town's main cemetery. The structure, in the form of a shield, is encircled by walls and chemin de ronde, broken by prismatic merlons and reinforced at its vertices and regular intervals by rectangular cubels. The principal wall is broken by two arched doors: one to the southeast between towers, and another larger door to the northwest, surmounted by a royal coat-of-arms, between armillary sphere and Christian cross. Carved on the left-side of the ashlar wall, of the tunnel entrance is an eroded inscription carved into rock, with decorated frame. Approximately , and sculpted in a square 20th century typeface, the plaque reads: A HIST√ìRIA DESTE CASTELO FOI RECORDADA COM GRATID√ÉO PELOS PORTUGUESES DE 1940 (The History of the Castle was Recorded with Gratitude by the Portuguese of 1940). A comparable inscription is found on the right-side of the southeast ashlar wall entrance, consisting of a semi- eroded plaque , with the words: PATRIM√ìNIO DO ESTADO. PRA√áA DE ARMAS (Patrimony of the State. Military Square). The keep tower is a rectangular two-storey structure above a sloping base, close to the southeast gate. This dungeon was later transformed into an exhibition hall for the castle. In the castle courtyard are the visible foundations of other dependencies, as well as the holes of the cistern. A limestone inscription to the Templars is recorded on a slab to the right side along the wall of one of the ruined buildings, with no frame or decoration. Consisting of a slab, the 20th century inscription reads: COMEMORA√á√ÉO DO DIA DA COMENDADORIA DE COIMBRA, RAINHA SANTA ISABEL Aos quatro dias do m√™s de Julho do Ano da Gra√ßa de dois mil e quatro, nesta mui nobre cidade de Pombal, na presen√ßa do seu Gr√£o Mestre Sua Alteza Eminent√≠ssima Don Fernando Pinto de Sousa Fontes e Gr√£ Prioresa de Portugal Sua Alteza Seren√≠ssima Dona Maria da Gl√≥ria Pinto de Sousa Fontes, com o Alto Patroc√≠nio do Excelent√≠ssimo Senhor Engenheiro Narciso Ferreira Mota, Presidente da C√¢mara Municipal de Pombal, os actuais templ√°rios recordam e homenageiam os seus ancestrais (Commemorating the Day of the Commandeering of Coimbra, Queen [Saint] Elizabeth. The fourth day of July in the Year of Grace, two thousand and four, in this very noble city of Pombal, in the presence of Grand Master, His Most Eminent Highness D. Fernando Pinto de Sousa Fontes and Grand Prioress of Portugal His Serene Highness D.Maria da Gloria Pinto de Sousa Fontes, under the High Patronage of His Excellency Engineer Ferreira Narciso Mota, Mayor of Pombal, the current Templar remember and honor their ancestors). Some historians suggest that this inscription was actually from the Castle of Almourol and not Pombal. A recent study of the inscription, by M√°rio Barroca, points to the probability, owing to the font-type, technique and organization, that the inscription showed similarities to those of the Almoural Castle.M√°rio Barroca (2000), vol.1, p.352-353 Along the southwest wall, is a double window, with which is a sculpted stone coat-of-arms of the Sousa Ribeiro clan, historical alcaldes of the castle. In front of the southeast gate, to the northwest, are the vestiges of the barbican. Outside the exterior walls, on a lower terrace on the mountain-top, are the ruins of a second series of walls, with three rectangular towers and a chapel of the Church of Santa Maria do Castelo. The chapel is dressed in square stone, decorated in the Renaissance-style of the period. Observable in one the fragments of the grave-stones of the chapel is the limestone inscription dedicating the grave to Sebasti√£o de Almeida. Of the Renaissance retables originally located in the Church, produced by Jo√£o de Ru√£o and J√°come de Bruges, one was relocated to the Church of S√£o Martinho, while another to the Church of the Cardal. An inscription commemorating the institution of an heir engraved on a stone slab bordered by a polygonal fillet, etched in shallow grooves, showing signs of erosion. Use a font-type common to the 19th century, the inscription reads: ESTA QUINTA FOI INSTITU√çDA EM MORGADO NO ANO DE 1551 PELLO VALEROSO CAPIT√ÉO JORGE BOTELHO CAVALEIRO FIDALGO NATURAL DA VILA DE POMBAL E A TOMOU EM SUA 3¬™(=TER√áA) COMO CONSTA DO SEU TESTAMENTO: ESTA MEM√ìRIA MANDOU FAZER SEU UND√âCIMO ADMINISTRADOR JORGE COELHO DE VASCONCELOS BOTELHO E SOUSA CAPIT√ÉO MOR DA DITA VILA NO ANO DE 1818 (This Quinta was instituted in the year 1551, by the valorous Captain Jorge Botelho, Faithful Knight and Natural of the town of Pombal, from his testament: This memorial was ordered built by the eleventh Administrator Jorge Coelho de Vasconcelas Botelho e Soura, Captain-major of the said town in 1818).

Castelo de Torres Vedras is a castle in Torres Vedras, Portugal. Characterized by a mix of Gothic and Manueline features, it is classified by IGESPAR as a Site of Public Interest. History Use of the castle area goes back to Roman times as evidenced by the existence of two Roman cisterns, tombstones, coins and other artifacts. Primitive fortifications date back to the time of the Goths. Its first walls were constructed by North Africans (known as Moors) during the time of Muslim control of Portugal. These walls were destroyed during the Christian reconquest when the castle was seized in 1148 by Afonso I of Portugal, but were immediately rebuilt. In 1288 King Denis ordered that the defences be strengthened and extended and Ferdinand I of Aragon ordered further improvements in 1373. The Castle of Torres Vedras has served as a temporary residence for several Portuguese kings. It was here that King John I gathered the Council that decided on the conquest in 1415 of Ceuta, a Spanish enclave in North Africa, that marked the beginning of the outward-looking policies of Portugal. In 1510, Torres Vedras received a municipal charter (Foral), and six years later King Manuel I, ordered reconstruction of the castle. Around 1520, the Palace of the Alcaides was constructed by the Chief Magistrate, Jo√£o Soares de Alarc√£o. It remains the dominant feature of the castle, despite being in ruins. In 1589, during the Philippine dynasty (1581-1640), forces of Ant√≥nio, Prior of Crato commanded by Sir Francis Drake disembarked in Peniche and briefly took the Castle of Torres Vedras. The castle suffered heavy damage from the 1755 earthquake, particularly the Palace of the Alcaides and some of the walls. In 1809, it was integrated into the Lines of Torres Vedras, which were defensive lines established by the Duke of Wellington to protect against French invasion during the Peninsular War. Together with the Fort of S√£o Vicente on a hill immediately to its north, the castle, with about 500 soldiers, guarded the main road between Coimbra and Lisbon. As part of the adaptation by the British Royal Engineers for this purpose the castle door was demolished. During the Liberal Wars (or Portuguese Civil War), sections of the walls facing east and some turrets on the north side were rebuilt. During the so-called Little Civil War in 1846, it served as barracks for the troops of the Count of Bonfim and was bombarded by the forces of the Duke of Saldanha, which caused the almost total ruin of the Palace. Despite its poor condition, the castle continued to function as a barracks until the end of the 19th century. In 1929, the Ministry of War transferred the property to the municipality of Torres Vedras. In 1955 there was a collapse of part of the wall to the northwest. In 1957 the castle was classified as a Property of Public Interest and this was followed by several repairs being carried out but there remained the danger of collapse to part of the walls, which happened in 1963, leading to additional repairs.

Although constructed in the first half of the 15th century, it is more commonly associated with the first of the Counts of Vidigueira: Vasco da Gama. History The first Donatary of Vidigueira and castle was Mestre Tom√©, treasurer of the S√© Cathedral of Braga during the reign of Afonso III of Portugal, making the construction of the castle part of the repopulation strategy of the 13th century. Mestre Tom√©, sometime supplier for the old Matriz church of the settlement, erected and reinforced the castle as a bastion of the defense line of the Guadiana, an important line between Portugal and Castile. A few decades later, at the beginning of the 14th century, King Denis recovered the village of Vidigueira for the Crown of Portugal. In 1385 King John I offered Vidigueira to his constable, Nuno √Ålvares Pereira. Through his daughter's (D. Beatriz Pereira Alvim) marriage, with D. Afonso, Count of Barcelos and first Duke of Braganza, the castle and courtyard in Vidigueira passed into the possession of the House of Braganza, one of the more opulent in the kingdom. The fortified rectangular tower, which today can still be appreciated, albeit the state of ruin, dates from the signeurial holdings of Fernando I, Duke of Braganza, in the first half of the 15th Century. With the confiscation of the properties and possessions of the House of Braganza, in 1483, the holdings were re-obtained by the Crown of Portugal, until its annulment in 1500, by Manuel I of Portugal. King Manuel, at that time, signed a foral for the town of Vidigueira, around 1512. But, little time passed, before the same monarch conceded to Vasco da Gama, then Admiral of India, the title of first Count of Vidigueira, compensating the navigator for his adventures. Once again, the castle left the possession of the House of Braganza; on 7 November 1519, Vasco da Gama signed a contract to sell and renounce these possessions, in favor of the House of Braganza. From √âvora the Palace of Vidigueira was transferred, including the not only the palace annex and fortifications. Of this palace, which was an important structure, nothing remains of this structure, except the Manueline window, brought from the Vila de Frades, a possession of the Counts of Vidigueira at the time. On 1 June 1992, the structure was transferred into the possession of the Instituto Portugu√™s do Patrim√≥nio Arquitect√≥nico (IPPAR) (by Decree 106F/92). Architecture The castle is located in an urban context, isolated on a plateau. It is situated on the western side of the town, within the urban area, with several buildings/structures surrounding it. Alongside the tower is a Manueline window brought from Vila de Frades, which was judged to have been from the Palace of the Counts of Vidigueira. A rectangular tower, the castle is a vertical block, with little ornamentation such as merlons. The tower that remains, known as the Atalaia das Vidigueiras, is a soft construction, regularly built, and altered with successive interventions. In a state of partial ruin, there are no coverings to protect what remains, nor merlons to crown the parapets. To the southwest is the beginnings of a wall, today transformed into a staircase, for access to the structure. In the southeast, is a sculpted stone with the coat-of-arms of the Counts of Vidigueira. The coat of arms includes a shield in the centre, with five smaller shields placed in a cruciform.

History  The early human occupation of the region dates back to prehistory; as archaeological evidence suggest, the region was visited and settled by successive centuries of Greek, Phoenician, Carthaginian, Roman, Goth and Muslim peoples. In 1160, D. Afonso Henriques donated Vila Verde dos Francos to D. Alardo, a French Captain and group of Crusaders, in recognition for their support in conquering Lisbon, Sintra, Almada, Palmela and Alenquer. Tradition suggests that D. Alardo was responsible for constructing the castle, following the Henriques issuing a Foral (charter). By the middle of the 18th century, there was already evidence that the castle was in ruins. Much of the landscape was inundated with wild blackberries, necessitating the need to clear the terrain, consolidate masonry and reposition some stones. The walls were further consolidated in 1987. At that time, researcher Jorge Peixoto, identified the compact structure as a chapel, dedicated to S√µa Lu√≠s. Architecture The building is situated in an isolated rural area, implanted at the top of a small hill of outcrops, near the settlement, surrounded by agricultural fields and vineyards. There remains several lines of foundation walls, forming an irregular plan. On the extremes are the remnants of rectangular towers with an entranceway along the lower part of the walls. On the opposite extreme, is a construction that could have resulted from the curvilinear segment of the wall, now in advanced state of ruin. Its general advance state of ruin makes it impossible to reconstitute its typology.

History Discoveries in 1956 that included a sword, some rock art (consisting of geometric designs) and axes, in the Quinta da Formiga and in Fraga, suggest a period of occupation dating from the Neolithic, late Bronze Age and Roman period. At about this time, from similar examples, it is presumed that a pre-Roman castro existed on the site. Around 60 A.D. Romans conquered the Lusitanian castro, but reconstructed and refortified the site. Fragments from tiles, ceramics and coins, in addition to vestiges of mosaics and Roman pavement, were discovered in and around the former castro. In 1139, the settlement was taken by Leonese troops from the Moors and a castle reconstructed on the site. It eventually began to pertain to the Order of S√£o Jo√£o do Pereiro. A 1227 Latin document referred for the first time to the Vilar Maior, a toponymy that was associated with the early small colony; \\"vilar\\", which is a diminutive of \\"vila\\" (or town) referred to the site occupied by a group of one of two families. In 1230, the site was reconquered by Leonoses forces from Portuguese troops. On 6 August 1232, a letter was issued by King D. Alfonso IV of Le√≥n to encourage settlement in the region. But this was annulled by King D. Fernando II of Le√≥n, who reintegrated Vilar Maior into the municipality of Sabugal. His successor was then responsible for the reconstruction of the castle in the intervening years. Between 12th and 13th century, the location was easily defended by natural defenses, but with the advent of canons the site began to be considered vulnerable. By the second half of the 13th century, a new settlement letter was issued by King D. Alfonso X of Le√≥n. By 1280, from an inscription, the urban perimeter wall ordered constructed by Alfonso X of Castile or, at least, the line that terminated at the Rua do Arco was concluded. In 1296, the castle was conquered by forces loyal to King D. Dinis, at the time garrisoned by Leonese D. Sancho Peres de Ledesma. A foral (charter) was conceded on 27 November 1296. The castle, or at least the keep tower, was constructed by King Dinis, with the assistance of the Knights Templar. By 12 September 1297, the territory was integrated into the Portuguese kingdom, during the sequence of the Treaty of Alcanices. Between 1367 and 1383 there were interventions in the castle under the initiative of D. Fernando, followed-up in 1398 by King D. John I. This work on the site, ultimately, led to the creation of the couto of Vilar Maior, which had attained a population of approximately 1000 residents by 1440. By the 1496 \\"Inquiri√ß√£o\\" (Inquiries), Vila Maior had reached a population of 234 residents. On 1 January 1510, the towns foral was upgraded and new interventions in the castle were undertaken by King D. Manuel I. Designs by Duarte d'Armas observed that the citadel included a double line of walls. Yet, even in this interpretation there were ruins and a line of walls that encircled the keep tower. The second line of walls, identifiable by a barbican, improved the defense and protection of the entryway. The keep tower was covered in tile and was accessible by a stone staircase that parted from the courtyard to the second level doorway. The design also included scaffolding around the tower, permitting a better line of protection around the keep and improving its protection. The scaffold protected the archers and created the conditions for vertical vollies identical to the machicolations, making the castle's defense more complex. Alongside the bridge were remains of town walls, therefore suggesting a third line of defenses. Today there are remnants of this group in the staircase near the old municipal building, along the Rua da Costa, and within the Museum of Vilar Maior; a majority of these walls were destroyed to make way for the walls of the cemetery. On 16 May 1516, the judges of Vilar Maior and Ciudad Rodrigo were responsible for recognizing the borders between the Portugal and Spain, demarcating the frontier in their decision. By 1527, the Cadastro do Reino (Kingdom's Cadastre), there were 60 dwellings in Vilar Maior, and a population of 422 inhabitants. By the 17th century, the castle had no defensive importance, resulting in reconfiguration and adoptions of the bastions, in comparison to the neighbouring defenses at the Castle of Almeida and Castle of Penamac√¥r. Br√°s Garcia de Mascarenhas wrote of the town: :There is the town of 60 neighbours, the castle is on a strong site by nature, the walls are weak and badly walled and very old. From this, two leagues from Alfaiates and two from Castelo de Albergaria and three from the town of Espeja, which remains alongside a pinery that begins near our arrival until near Cida Rodrigo, three to four leagues length, one and a half wide and very dense, is a nest of thieves and wild animals. It remains near the our locality of Nave de Haver and a league inside Malhada Sorda, both with 200 neighbours, which are part of Vilar Maior, whose alcalde-mor received 600,000 reis for the Count of Ficalho, Duke of Villa Hermosa, I do not know how, but today they request a lot from Your Majesty, and until now have given little.Rita Costa Gomes (1997), p. 115) On 27 January 1653, D. Fernando Teles de Menezes Silva, was made the Count of Vilar Maior, later Marqu√™s of Penalva and Alegrete, and Commander of the Order of Malta. During the events of the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, the castle was unaffected by the cataclysm. During references from the 1758 Mem√≥rias Paroquiais, written by Francisco Antunes, the alcalde was identified as Joaquim Jos√© Nobre de Miranda. It was defined as encountered \\"encircled, [but] with little defense for being in ruins\\",Carlos Henrique Gon√ßalves Jorge (1991), p. 39 had three watchtowers, also in ruins, with tile and wood and walled castle, with little water and many buildings in ruin. The two register tower was also in a pessimistic state of conservation. In the 19th century, during French invasion of the peninsula, the settlement was invaded and pillaged. During the 1834-1853 Liberal wars, the town was also suffered the consequences of the Liberal-Miguelist conflicts. On 24 October 1855, the municipal status was extinguished, and the Vila Maior was integrated into the municipality of Sabugal. By 1864, there were 160 dwellings and the population included little more than 679 inhabitants, which progressively increased in the intervening years (by 1890, there were 199 dwellings and 742 residents). By 1940, there were 267 dwellings and only 745 inhabitants. In the 20th century, the former communal kiln/earthen stove was recuperated and transformed into a tourist post and handicrafts shop. Architecture The castle is located on the limit of the urban agglomeration, situated on a cliff plateau over the settlement dominated by the valley of the Rio Cesar√£o, protected in the east by the rocky cliffs of the river and west, by steep slopes. The city of Guarda is clearly visible from the heights of the plateau. In the relative proximity of the cemetery and the ruins of the Church of Nossa Senhora do Castelo; in the place of Correia, visitors can observe anthropomorphic tombs. The castle is Romanesque/Gothic military structure; the structure follows an oval plan, with rectangular keep tower, three registers high, straight embrasures and broken Romanesque door accessible from the battlements. The keep tower is almost addorsed to the exterior and lacks merlons along the walls, accessible by five staircases from battlements. In the western exterior section, a wall extends to the outside wall. It has two doors: in the southeast, covered with broken barrel vault, preserving monumental hinges; and in the northwest, with broken bow on the upper surface and full arch inside, covered with a broken barrel vault and preserved stonework hinges. There is a circular cistern without covering in the interior of the courtyard. The high, rectangular keep tower without roof extends to three floors. The northern facade has straight arrow slits on each floor, and in the east, a line of embrasures is surmounted by shell with real guns framed by protruding rectangular frame, the first coming in the second, embrasure line with half-round frame and, top, embrasure line. The south facade has an embrasure along the third register and along the western line, where the first floor is almost addorsed to the wall and second floor door with broken arch. Most of the stones are inscribed with Templar abbreviations. The interior was almost completely destroyed, and little remains of the visible structure of the floors, except for a flight of stairs in the north and east, and corbels supporting pavement. The battlements have a rounded profile, with vestiges of a third line of walls near the stairs that access the old hall, along Rua da Costa and Rua do Castelo and within the Museum of Vilar Maior. Remains of the third wall are also visible on the stairs leading to old town hall. Commemorative inscriptions on the completion of the wall, or partial segment of the urban perimeter, are visible on the wall. Recorded in the doorframe of the gate of the Rua do Arco is an inscription in capital letters, reading: :ERA DE M[C]CC XVIIJ :It was of 1280.

It is one of the founding members of the United Grand Lodges of Germany and as such it is one of the five German Grand Lodges recognized as \\"regular\\" Grand Lodges by the United Grand Lodge of England (UGLE).UGLE recognized Grand Lodges in Europe The Grand Lodge was established in 1770 by Johann Wilhelm Kellner von Zinnendorf, a Prussian army physician. It is one of three so called Old Prussian Grand Lodges. The Grand Landlodge of the Freemasons of Germany works according to a slightly modified version of the Swedish Rite. It therefore differs from other German Grand Lodges both in its content and organizational structure. However, as a masonic Grand Lodge it is not a religious community and affiliation to a particular Christian denomination is not required. Neither is it necessary for a member of the Order to be expressly Christian, however the Rules of the Order demand that every member \\"recognize the teachings of Jesus Christ as they are written down in the Holy Scripture\\".Rules of the Order/ Ordensregel der GLLFvD The Order of Freemasons demands that its members keep working continuously at the development of their own personality. Rationality and conscience, inner freedom and self-knowledge as well as being conscious of one's responsibilities are regarded as the necessary means by which one can approach the finding of the origin, character and destiny of mankind and the whole of existence. Provincial Lodge of Lower Saxony in Hamburg, Lodge House  Organizational Structure  The Grand Landlodge of the Freemasons of Germany is divided into three branches: * St. John's Lodge (i.e. Blue Lodge, or Craft Lodge) working the regular three masonic degrees, * St. Andrew's Lodge working the IVth to VIth degree * The Chapter working the VIIth to Xth degree \\\\- apart from this, there is also a High Chapter for the holders of the XIth degree of Knight Commander with some 70 members.GLLFvD Handbook/Handbuch der GLLFvD 2007 The conjunction of these branches forms a cohesive masonic body that closely follows that of the Swedish Rite, which is predominantly found in Scandinavian countries. Institutions of the Order of Freemasons include: * the Research Lodge Frederik based in Flensburg/Husum and founded in 1982, * the Freemasonry Museum in St. Michaelisdonn, * the Zinnendorf Foundation in Hamburg-Eppendorf, founded in 1991, * the Zirkelkorrespondenz, the Order's member's journal, founded in 1872, * the organization St. John's Fraternal Help for Self Help (St. Johannis Bruderhilfe zur Selbsthilfe), founded in 1998 and organizes social relief projects in Eastern Europe. The new headquarters of the Order are situated in Berlin-Dahlem, the former headquarters having been destroyed in World War II. The Order is headed by a dual leadership consisting of the Master of the Order(Ordensmeister) and the Grand Master of the Land(Landesgro√ümeister). The Grand Master of the Land is the administrative head of the Great Landlodge. He is elected by the main assembly and is comparable to the Grand Masters of other Grand Lodges. He heads the St. John's and St. Andrew's Lodges. The Master of the Order is the elected head of the Order in its entirety. He heads the Chapter and safeguards the teachings and traditions of the Grand Landlodge. The Grand Master of the Land is aided by a council of Grand Officers, the Master of the Order is aided by the Council of the Order. The most prominent Master of the Order was the future (1888) German Emperor Frederick III. At present, there are ten Provincial Lodges that administrate the activities of the St. John's and St. Andrew's Lodges of a certain district. The GLLFvD's St. John's lodges are comparable to the blue lodges of other Grand Lodges and work the same degrees. The St. Andrew's Lodges and Chapters are comparable to Appendant Bodies. At present, the Grand Landlodge claims to have 3,500 members. In the year 1934 the number was said to have been near to 20,000 members in 178 lodges, predominantly in Prussia. In the area of the former German Democratic Republic 18 St. John's and 2 St. Andrew's lodges have been reactivated. In 2007 the Grand Landlodge included 109 St. John's lodges, 26 St. Andrew's lodges, 10 Provincial lodges and 11 Chapters. The Grand Landlodge is strongest in the German States of Hamburg, Lower Saxony and Berlin. In the course of the last years individual lodges have been established in Lome/Togo, Riga/Latvia and Monaco, of which only the first one in Lome is still a member of the Grand Landlodge. The Provincial Lodges are intermediaries between the St. John's and St. Andrew's lodges and the Grand Master of the Land. They administer the Lodges of their particular area, to simplify the work of the Grand Master. With the exception of the Provincial Lodge of Lower Saxony, all Provincial Lodges in existence today, have been founded in the course of the 20th century. The borders of today's Provincial Lodges are approximately equal to today's state borders. The 10 modern day Grand Lodges: * Provincial Lodge of Lower Saxony in Hamburg, founded in 1777 * Provincial Lodge Mecklenburg in Rostock, founded in 1995 * Provincial Lodge Bavaria in Munich, founded in 1925 * Provincial Lodge Hesse in Frankfurt, founded in 1948 * Provincial Lodge Schleswig-Holstein in Kiel, founded in 1951 * Provincial Lodge Northrhine-Westphalia in Hagen, founded in 1952 * Provincial Lodge Baden-W√ºrttemberg in Stuttgart, founded in 1955 * Provincial Lodge Bremen-Oldenburg in Bremen, founded in 1989 * Provincial Lodge Saxony- Thuringia in Leipzig, founded in 2004 * Provincial Lodge Berlin-Brandenburg in Berlin, founded in 2005 Apart from the still existing first Provincial Lodge of Lower Saxony, the historic Provincial Lodges included the Provincial Lodge of Silesia (1779‚Äì1935), Pommerania (1777‚Äì1812) and Austria (1776‚Äì1783). Following these was the establishment of a Provincial Lodge of Russia in St. Petersburg (1777‚Äì1785) and a Provincial Lodge of Westphalia in 1808. These Provincial Lodges are no longer in existence.  History  = Early history = During the 18th century, some 70% of German Masonic Lodges worked according to the rituals of the Strict Observance. In the 1760s resentment was growing against the rituals of that Order, which were regarded as lacking in content and overly pompous, as well as the Strict Observance's \\"economical plan\\". As one of those, who were unsatisfied with this Rite, Johann Wilhelm Kellner von Zinnendorf wrote to the Grand Lodge in London, asking for a patent to establish a new Lodge. However the London Grand Lodge declined, as there were already a great number of Masonic Lodges and Grand Lodges in existence in Berlin at that time. After that, Kellner von Zinnendorf tried, through the help of a friend of his, to gain a patent and rituals from Karl Friedrich Eckleff in Sweden. This attempt also failed, but other friends of his continued with these attempts. At this point, he was still acting in accordance with the Army Master (Heermeister) of the Strict Observance, who was informed of his actions.Runkel II S.119 Only a friend of Kellner von Zinnendorf's called Baumann finally managed to gain Eckleff's trust. On 14 September 1766 he returned to Berlin carrying a personal letter from Eckleff to Kellner von Zinnendorf, containing the ritual files, a charter permitting the establishment of Lodges abiding by the Swedish Rite, instructions for the Master of the Order and directions for the establishment of a Chapter. Shortly thereafter, a quarrel began between Kellner von Zinnendorf and the Army Master of the Strict Observance, von Hund. On 16 December 1766, Kellner von Zinnendorf left the Strict Observance and spent his time concentrating on the establishment of a new Grand Lodge.Runkel II S. 121 During this time, Baumann's files were translated into German and several Lodges, working according to the new ritual, were founded in the Berlin area. Kellner von Zinnendorf's goal was to create at least 12 Lodges, in order to found his new Grand Lodge. However on 27 December 1770 it was decided to go ahead with the establishment of the Grand Landlodge of the Freemasons of Germany, even though only 7 St. John's Lodges and one St. Andrew's Lodge had so far been founded. Following the establishment, Kellner von Zinnendorf was anxious to get on good terms with the Grand Lodge in London. On 30 November 1773 an official letter of recognition arrived from London, to the effect that the Grand Landlodge was recognized as the sole Grand Lodge of the German states and was thus regarded as an equal by the Grand Lodge in London.Runkel II S. 142 On 14 October 1773 a meeting was arranged between representatives of the Grand Landlodge and of the Strict Observance. There an unsteady agreement was achieved, ending long lasting conflict between the two rites that had been raging since Kellner von Zinnendorf left the Strict Observance in 1766. Another milestone in the history of the Grand Landlodge was Frederick the Great's Letter of Protection of 16 July 1774, which guaranteed the Grand Landlodge his royal protection.Runkel II S. 198 In Sweden Duke Charles of S√∂dermanland had taken over the office of Master of the Order from Eckleff in 1773. As he was additionally offered the office of Army Master of the Strict Observance and he accepted, relations between the Grand Lodge of Sweden and the Grand Landlodge deteriorated. Around the year 1778 the Grand Landlodge consisted of 34 Lodges. After the death of its founder Kellner von Zinnendorf, in the year 1782 it consisted of a total of 62 Lodges. Provincial Lodges were created in Austria, Silesia, Pomerania, Lower Saxony and Russia.Holtorf S. 69f. = 19th century = The history of the Grand Landlodge in the course of the 19th century includes several high points. Following the death of King Carl XIII of Sweden on 5 February 1818 there was a reconciliation with the Grand Lodge of Sweden, which amounted to a Treaty of Friendship that was signed on 13 April 1819. Using the new rituals that were sent from Sweden, Christian Karl Friedrich Wilhelm von Nettelbladt implemented a significant reform of the rituals. In 1872 Adolf Widmann founded the Zirkelkorrespondenz, a masonic magazine, which is still published today and distributed among the members of the Grand Landlodge. Widmann traveled to Sweden in 1869 and worked on a further compilation of the rituals. The two most prominent members of the Grand Landlodge during the 19th century were the German Emperors William I and Frederick III; the latter was also Master of the Order of the Grand Landlodge. = 20th century = Following a meeting between Hermann G√∂ring and Grand Master of the Land von Heeringen on 7 April 1933 the GLL officially rejected its masonic foundation and especially eliminated all parts of the ritual drawing on the Old Testament and got rid of all masonic nomenclature. It now bore the name of \\"German-Christian Order of the Knights Templar\\". On 10 April 1933 von Heeringen informed the other two Old Prussian Lodges of this conversion. In the days that followed, the other Old Prussian Lodges followed its example.Neuberger S. 245/246 Internally everything that was considered typical of Freemasonry was either changed or eliminated. The aprons were abolished, Solomon's Temple was changed to the \\"German Cathedral\\" or Strasbourg Cathedral, all parts of the ritual referring to or drawing from the Old Testament were done away with and the legend of Hiram Abiff replaced by the ancient Germanic legend of Baldr. However none of these conversions were ever accepted by the Nazi Party.Neuberger S. 249 Thus the leaders of the national Grand Lodges demonstrated a grave misjudgement of Freemasonry's role in the National Socialist view of the world. Years of Nazi propaganda had stylized Freemasonry to a form of abstract hate symbol similar to the Jews. Therefore they were generally regarded as enemies.Neuberger S. 248 The Grand Landlodge tried in vain to take legal action against the increasing riots against the Lodges that had increased dramatically since the Nazi seizure of power in 1933. Of course the legal proceedings against local leaders of the Sturmabteilung and the Nazi Party were unsuccessful. When all legal actions failed, no further noteworthy resistance was offered by the GLL. Its officials are said to have asked for the intervention of the Swedish King Gustav V, which was obviously unsuccessful as well. However, they managed to smuggle essential parts of their archive to Sweden, through dubious connections. These documents were returned in 1978.Neuberger S. 256 In the spring of 1935, the Grand Lodge of Prussia, called \\"Zur Freundschaft\\", tried to find a solution for the situation. Their most prominent member, the Reich Minister Hjalmar Schacht was sent to talk to Hitler and found out that a dissolution of German Freemasonry was inevitable.Neuberger S. 257 The Interior Ministry ordered that all Grand Lodges along with their constituent lodges had to be disbanded by 21 July 1935. On 14 July 1935 a final ceremony was held by the Grand Landlodge. Immediately following World War II preparations were made for the reestablishment of the Grand Landlodge. Dr. Hans Oehmen was elected the first Master of the Order of the post-war period. Paul Rosenthal became the Grand Lodge's first Grand Master of the Land, however he died as early as 1946. The negotiations that finally led to the establishment of the United Grand Lodges of Germany - Brotherhood of Freemasons, were led by the 19th Master of the Order Dr. Fritz Pauk.

In 1786 a property in Berlin was acquired for its use by Christoph Friedrich Nicolai. On these grounds the first \\"House of the Order\\" was built and turned over to the Grand Landlodge in 1791. Initially this house remained private property, but between 1806 and 1816 it housed the French General Staff. See also: ‚ÜíHistory of Berlin In 1821 the building passed into the ownership of the Grand Landlodge. In 1839 the \\"House of the Order\\" was extended and was ornamented with a Classicist facade. As the number of members in the city of Berlin increased to more than 1200, the building had to be extended once more, in 1845. In 1898 it was sold to the Post Office as another extension would not have been possible. Until the completion of the new \\"House of the Order\\", the lodges of the Grand Landlodge made use of the facilities of the other two Old Prussian Lodges. The Foundation Stone Ceremony for the second \\"House of the Order\\" took place on 11 November 1898 and the dedication of the building took place on 18 November 1900. It was the largest \\"House of the Order\\" of the Grand Landlodge to date. The building's 15,000 m¬≤ housed 8 temples, 2 great banquet halls, 2 assembly halls, 3 conference rooms, 6 residential flats, an archive, a museum's hall and several administrative offices. The \\"House of the Order\\" was lost through the compulsory expropriation by the National Socialist Government in 1935. During World War II it was heavily damaged by bombings and looting. In December 1945 the building's basement was once again used for meetings, but the house could not be rebuilt. Therefore the property was sold in 1965. The money gained from selling the old property, together with donations from the Landlodge's members, served to buy the new, albeit smaller, \\"House of the Order\\".

On the Kenyan side, it is located south of the village of Nghonji while on the Tanzanian side, it is situated within Mwanga District, in Kilimanjaro Region. The lake is fed mainly by the Lumi River, which descends from Mount Kilimanjaro, as well as streams from the North Pare Mountains, being on the leeward side. The lake's outlet forms the Ruvu River. Kenya's unfenced Tsavo West National Park protects part of the lake's northern shore, while on the Tanzania side Mkomazi Game Reserve is nearby. The lake is known for its endemic fish, as well as water birds, mammals, wetland plants and lake-edge swamps, which can extend from Jipe's shore. Geography The lake is accessible via the B1 Highway from the village of Kifaru, about south of the Tanzanian town of Moshi. Jipe covers an area of roughly , and measures approximately long by broad. Jipe is a shallow backwater of the Lumi river, which afterwards becomes the Ruvu River, and enters in the Nyumba ya Mungu Reservoir. After joining there with the Kikuletwa the stream flows as Pangani River in the Indian Ocean at Pangani. The lake lacks a current as the river that flows in, turns round and flows out again. Its water is only drinkable after it has been well boiled and skimmed. On its southern bank, the mountains of Ugweno rise , contrasting markedly with the opposite shore, which is a flat plain, but little raised above the lake. Mount Kilimanjaro's Kibo Peak is viewable from the lake. Demographics Some 120,000 people depend on the lake for their livelihood. The inhabitants of villages surrounding Lake Jipe are mainly involved in fishing, agriculture and animal husbandry. To the south-east of the great mountain is the little agricultural colony of Taveta. Ki-taveta is the language used by the Bantu half of the population, and Maasai is the language of the remainder. Ki-gweno is the dialect of the Ugweno mountains (Ugono) to the south of Lake Jipe. Lake water is used for irrigation of the surrounding farmlands. Fauna The probability of long-time isolation from other wetlands is suggested by a fish endemic to the lake, the Jipe tilapia. Jipe's waters are teeming with big fish, principally siluriforms and cyprinoids. Jipe forms a biodiversity rich ecosystem also known for the water birds that frequent its reedy shores; these include storks, egrets, pelicans, spur-winged plovers, ducks, and Egyptian geese. Lesser jacana and the African swamphen are common on the lake and Madagascar squacco heron, black heron, African darter and African skimmers are often seen. The vicinity of the lake is frequented by herds of game. Hippopotami and Nile crocodiles are plentiful.

It is a direct right tributary of the Moselle, and thus a sub-tributary of the Rhine. Geography The Moselotte rises in the massif des Vosges at the fontaine de la Duchesse, near the summit of Hohneck. It flows into the Moselle at Remiremont. Its length is , while its watershed is . =Communes traversed by the Moselotte= The Moselotte flows through, from upstream to downstream, the communes of La Bresse, Cornimont, Saulxures, Thi√©fosse, Vagney, Saint-Am√©, Le Syndicat, Dommartin-l√®s-Remiremont and Saint-√âtienne-l√®s-Remiremont opposite the town of Remiremont. =Main tributaries= The Moselotte is fed by the following tributaries: { - valign=\\"top\\"  * Blanchemer (flows through lac de Blanchemer) * R√©git * Machey * Goutte de la Vierge * Goutte du Pont d'Air * Goutte du Pr√© Gu√©ry * Goutte de S√©chemer * Goutte du lac des Corbeaux * Goutte des Betches * Goutte des Ecorces * Chajoux (from lac de Lispach) * Grande Goutte  * Goutte de la Louvi√®re * Goutte du Brabant * Goutte du Reucy * Goutte du Raind√© * Goutte du Couchetat * Goutte de Parfongoutte * Goutte du Droit * Xoulces * Ventron * G√©hant * Morbieux * Rupt de B√¢mont  * Amias * Grettery * Envers des Graviers * Envers de Thi√©fosse * Droit de Thi√©fosse * Rupt * Solem * Demixard * Penneci√®res * Bouchot * L√©mont * Cleurie. } =Lakes= The Moselotte watershed includes numerous natural lakes which are often enhanced by a small barrage, including lac de Blanchemer, lac de Lispach and lac des Corbeaux. The presence of a high barrage at the foot of Kastelberg since 1983 has resulted in the appearance of the lac de la Lande. It collects water from several sources via conduits, and supplies the La Bresse commune with its energy. At the entry downstream of Saulxures, a lake of was set up in 1998 under the name lac de la Moselotte which hosts a leisure center. =Hydrology - at Vagney station= Like the majority of Vosges rivers, the Moselotte is very substantial. Its flow rate has been observed during a period of 40 years Vagney at a place called Zainvilliers, which is upstream of the Moselotte's confluence with the Moselle.Banque Hydro - Station A4140202 - La Moselotte √† Vagney (option Synth√®se) (don't tick \\"Station en service\\") The river's watershed at this point is or 53 percent of its entire watershed, corresponding to the upper half of its course. The average interannual flow rate, or discharge at Vagney is . The Moselotte exhibits quite marked seasonal fluctuations, with a winter-spring period of high water whose monthly average flow rate is between from November to April inclusive, with a maximum in December. From the beginning of May, the flow rate falls off rapidly, reaching in August, which is not very severe for a body of water of this size.

Floods can also be significant particularly bearing in mind the smallness of the watershed, only . The maximum instantaneous flow rates over a 2-year and 5-year period (MIFR2 and MIFR5) measure respectively. The MIFR10 is , the MIFR20 is , while the MIFR50 rises to . The maximum instantaneous flow rate recorded at Vagney was on 15 February 1990, while the maximum daily average flow rate was on the same day. Comparing these values to the MIFR measurements for the river suggests that the flood on that day was approximately a 10-year event and thus likely to recur frequently. Overall the Moselotte is an extremely abundant river in its upper course. The runoff curve number in this 53 percent of its watershed is annually, which is extremely high for the northern part of France, and more than four times higher than the French national average. It is also three times higher than the average over the French basin of the Moselle. The specific flow rate attaches to these facts the portentous figure of 45.7 litres per second per square kilometre of watershed. =Hydrology - at the confluence with the Moselle= The interannual flow rate/discharge of the Moselotte at its confluence with the Moselle is , for a watershed of . The runoff curve number in its watershed is , which is very high indeed, not merely much higher than the average for France (by more than a factor of three) with all basins included, but also much higher than the average for the French Moselle basin. In fact, the runoff curve number at Hauconcourt, located slightly downstream of the town of Metz, near where it leaves French territory, rises to .Banque Hydro - Station A7930610 - La Moselle √† Hauconcourt (Do not tick the box for \\"Station en service\\") The specific flow rate of the Moselotte rises to 38.5 litres per second per square kilometre of watershed. This, along with the Breuchin (a tributary of the Lanterne and sub- tributary of the Sa√¥ne which flows elsewhere in the same region) constitutes a record for the north third of France. The Moselotte is clearly more abundant than the Moselle at their confluence, against . Water quality While in 2005, the water quality of the Moselotte was classified as category 1B, or \\"bonne\\" (good), the situation deteriorated somewhat in 2006, when the Rhine- Meuse water agency concluded that the river water analysed at the level of Autrive was now only \\"passable\\", or category 2.SIERM - Syst√®me d'Information sur l'Eau Rhin-Meuse: Qualit√© de l'eau superficielle (cours d'eau) The reason was a highly depressed rate of oxygen saturation (also classed as \\"passable\\"), which had gone from 76% in 2005 to 69% in 2006. The chemical oxygen demand, at 6.5 mg/l in 2006, was still classified \\"bonne\\". The ammonium ion level was measured at 0.09 mg/l, which was classed as \\"excellent\\". The Bas de La Bresse Saulxures-sur-Moselotte: The lac de la Moselotte Abbey church of Saint-Pierre de Remiremont  Economy  Highly populated by trout, the river has given rise to a significant breakthrough in fish farming, namely the invention of artificial reproduction by Joseph Remy and Antoine G√©hin in the 19th century. The Moselotte basin also has the highest density in the world in small hydroelectric barrages, which serve the watermills, sawmills, spinning and weaving houses along the river and its tributaries. : The photograph opposite, taken upstream of La Bresse, shows a diversion powering a turbine. The main point has been equipped with a fish ladder. A railway line once ran along the Moselotte valley between Remiremont and Cornimont.

Description It typically grows to a height of and has a tall and spreading habit. It has smooth reddish-brown coloured bark and spreading, almost terete and glabrous branches. Like most species of Acacia it has phyllodes rather than true leaves. The thick, flat and rigid grey to green phyllodes have a length of up to and a width of around with an oblong-lanceolate shape that is straight or curved. They have a prominent mid-vein with many fine lateral veins and thickened margins. It blooms between July and October producing short flower-spikes located in axillary racemes composed spherical flower- heads made up of 4 to 16 deep yellow flowers. Following flowering brown seed pods form that have a narrowly oblong shape with a length of up to and a width of around and contain hard back ovoid shaped seeds with a length of and a width of . Taxonomy The species was first formally described by the botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in 1858 as part of the work Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae. It was reclassified by Leslie Pedley in 2003 as Racosperma notabile but transferred back to genus Acacia in 2014. It is related to Acacia beckleri. Distribution The shrub is native to the Broken Hill district of arid far western New South Wales as well as Victoria and South Australia. The bulk of the population is found in South Australia where the shrub is considered to be quite common. In South Australia it is found on the Eyre Peninsula, the Flinders Ranges, the Mount Lofty Ranges and the Yorke Peninsula as well as more arid areas inland.

It was ordered into active service on 15 November 1942 at Camp Claiborne, Louisiana. The 103rd Infantry Division was activated as a reserve division on 7 May 1947 in Des Moines, Iowa. In February 1963, its combat elements were redesignated and reorganized as the 205th Infantry Brigade and the 103rd Operational Headquarters. In June of that year, that headquarters was redesignated 103rd Command Headquarters (Divisional). In December 1965, it was reorganized as the 103rd Support Brigade. The 103rd Support Brigade was redesignated and reorganized as the 103rd Corps Support Command (COSCOM) in September 1977. The 103rd COSCOM was the first corps support command in the U.S. Army Reserve. On 15 September 1993, the 103rd COSCOM inactivated. Out of the inactivation of the 103rd COSCOM was the birth of two new reserve units: the 19th Theater Army Area Command (CONUS) and the 3rd COSCOM (CONUS). On 14 February 2006 the 103rd was redesignated as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 103rd Expeditionary Sustainment Command. The 103rd Expeditionary Sustainment Command re-activated as a reserve command effective 16 September 2006. Although the division was officially relocated to the Iowa and Minnesota area in 1947, its Cactus Patch still reflects the unit's original geographic locations. The 103rd has transformed from an infantry division, to a support brigade, to a corps support command, to an Expeditionary Sustainment Command. = Operation Iraqi Freedom = In April 2010, the 103rd ESC deployed to Iraq in support of operations Iraqi Freedom and New Dawn and provided logistics and support to forces throughout the country. 103rd ESC's first deployment as an expeditionary sustainment command. The 103rd ESC's mission in Iraq was to reduce the footprint of the U.S. military presence in Iraq by providing logistical support and assistance with the responsible drawdown of equipment while simultaneously sustaining troops in theater. More than half the soldiers currently assigned to the 103rd ESC have been deployed previously to Iraq or Afghanistan with different units in support of other missions.http://www.dvidshub.net/news/49286/hail-and-farewell-mighty-103rd News: Hail and Farewell, Mighty 103rd! = Operation Enduring Freedom = On 16 June 2013, Soldiers from the 103rd ESC were deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and provide Combat Service Support capabilities within Regional Command East (RC East) and Regional Command North (RC North), in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. The deployed Soldiers came from the 203rd Transportation Company (Inland) to participate in this deployment as the 203rd Inland Cargo Transportation Company.  Unit Insignia  = Shoulder Sleeve Insignia (SSI) = On a yellow disc in diameter, a blue horizontal base, overall a green giant cactus, all with a Army green border. The cactus represents the home area of the unit in the Southwest when it was first organized and is symbolic of the unit's nickname. The shoulder sleeve insignia was originally approved for the 103d Division on 14 October 1922 and the approval specified the segment at the bottom of the disc to be the color of the branch of service. On 18 June 1935, the authorization was amended to standardize the design with the segment at the bottom of the disc to be blue. It was redesignated for the 103rd Command Headquarters (Divisional) on 23 October 1963. It was redesignated for the 103rd Support Command on 29 March 1978. The insignia was redesignated effective 16 September 1993, for the 103rd Infantry Division. It was redesignated effective 16 September 2006, for the 103rd Expeditionary Sustainment Command and updated to add a symbolism. = Distinctive Unit Insignia (DUI) = A gold color metal and enamel device in height overall consisting of a gold heraldic millrind supporting a gold arrow, point up, and bearing upon its crossbar a blue fleur-de-lis between two blue five pointed stars; all upon a scarlet field and above a blue concave scroll, with ends white and folded vertically terminating at the outer edge of the crossbar, inscribed on the blue portion \\"WE SUCCEED\\" and on the white portion a cactus on the left side and a Yale key on the right, both vertical and gold. Buff (gold) and scarlet are the colors associated with US Army Support units. The millrind is symbolic of strength and support; the stars denote military leadership and the arrow suggests combat readiness. The cactus refers to the unit's early history as the Cactus Division and the key to its later redesignation to a Support Brigade. The fleur-de-lis and two stars represent World War II combat service in the Rhineland, Ardennes-Alsace and Central Europe campaigns. The colors blue, white and scarlet also refer to the flag of Iowa, location of the unit's headquarters. The distinctive unit insignia was originally approved for the 103d Support Command (Corps) on 10 August 1982. It was redesignated effective 16 September 2006, for the 103d Sustainment Command with the description updated. = Combat Service Identification Badge (CSIB)= A gold color metal and enamel device in diameter consisting of a design similar to the shoulder sleeve insignia.

Description The openly branched spreading tree or shrub typically grows to a height of with a well developed canopy. It has hard grey glossy bark that is occasionally fissured with pruinose orange to yellow branchlets. It has falcate to subfalcate glaucous green phyllodes that are long and wide. It produces between April and October and produces yellow inflorescences, usually racemose or axillary or terminal panicles long. These eventually develop into narrow oblong woody glabrous seed pods that are in length containing glossy black seeds. A. tumida grows quickly but has a short lifespan, usually less than 10 years. Range A. tumida has a range that extends from the Kimberley, Pilbara and north eastern Goldfields regions of Western Australia including much of the Great Sandy Desert. It also extends into the Victoria River district of the Northern Territory. It grows well in sandplain areas in red sandy or pindan soils over sandstone. They often form dense thickets with spinifex. It is also cultivated in Yemen, Vietnam, Senegal and Niger. Varieties There are four recognised varieties of Acacia tumida: *Acacia tumida var. extensis *Acacia tumida var. kulparn *Acacia tumida var. pilbarensis *Acacia tumida var. tumida Uses Indigenous Australians used the trunk of young trees to fashion spears and boomerangs. The green seed pods were cooked over coals and the seeds then eaten. Fully ripened black seeds were ground into flour mixed with water and consumed as a paste or cooked and eaten as a damper. Other traditional uses include making string from the bark and using the gum exudate as a food source. It is cultivated in Senegal and Niger, where it is used as good quality firewood and to create low windbreaks. It is also used with slower growing plants for binding soil.

He died in 1920, and the business was left to his employees Oliver Cox and William Barnard. They renamed the company and moved to new offices at Old Shoreham Road. The premises were later extended, giving a design studio at the front and an extra storey above. In 1968, the firm bought the former Livingstone Road Baths building from Hove Council and converted it into a new office. The building's former use was commemorated by an elaborate stained glass window designed in-house and displayed near the entrance: it depicted three old-fashioned metal baths, a variety of people bathing or carrying supplies, and a coal-fired boiler with its copper pipework. The company continues to operate from the premises, which combine design and manufacturing facilities and a showroom which is open to the public. Cox & Barnard received many commissions in the Brighton and Hove area, for both religious and secular buildings. Many of the interwar semi- detached houses in the Nevill Road area of Hove have Art Nouveau-style leaded light panels and roundels in their doors and porches; and the Metropole, Brighton's largest hotel, had some stained glass installed during its postwar reconstruction. The firm designed a glazed canopy at the entrance of the former Hove Town Hall (destroyed by fire in 1966), featuring the design of the Hove coat of arms; in 1946 they installed a window in the tower of the medieval parish church of Portslade, St Nicolas' Church; and in the late 20th century they designed stained glass windows for two synagogues in Hove and restored the windows in the 19th-century Middle Street Synagogue in Brighton. Most of the firm's work has been done elsewhere in southeast England for Anglican and Roman Catholic churches‚Äîeither in the company's own name or in the name of an individual designer working for them. One commission also came from outside England. In the early 1940s, Major Rev. Harold Appleyard, an army chaplain from The Royal Regiment of Canada, started collecting fragments of stained glass from church windows destroyed by World War II bombing. He had already accumulated shards from more than 100 damaged churches in countries across Europe when in 1944, immediately after 40 soldiers from the regiment died at Louvigny, he found a piece of bright red glass from the French town's bombed church. This inspired him to turn his collection of fragments into a window to commemorate them and other victims of the war. He had already spent part of his tour of duty in England (his glass collection included shards from Coventry Cathedral, St James's Church in Dover and several of Christopher Wren's London churches), and after the war he returned to the country to find a stained glass manufacturer that could create a window from the hundreds of fragments‚Äîpreferably using the old-fashioned technique of using sawdust as a drying agent. He approached Cox & Barnard, and their designers were able to produce six mosaic-style windows; these were shipped to Canada and taken to Appleyard's parish church‚ÄîChrist Church Anglican in Meaford, Ontario‚Äîwhere they were installed and dedicated in 1946 in a ceremony broadcast in Britain and Canada. On the sixth of June 2014 the company was dissolved. Anglican churches ;St Mary's Church, Newick, East Sussex A window at St Mary's Church, Newick Elijah and Elisha are depicted in a Cox & Barnard window of 1986 in the north aisle of Newick's church. The aisle was added to the 12th- century church in 1836. ;All Saints Church, Staplehurst, Kent The firm's work in Staplehurst's parish church consists of six windows supplied in 1952 and designed by Owen Jennings. Those in the north chapel (one single-light and one two-light window) and the north aisle (three two-light windows) have heraldic badges and emblems, and another two-light window in the north aisle has a Nativity scene. ;Holy Trinity Church, Eridge Green, East Sussex The church at Eridge was built in the 1850s and altered in 1875. Working for Cox & Barnard, Charles Knight designed three windows for the church: one in the north transept in 1950 (depicting the Good Shepherd and the \\"Suffer Little Children\\" passage from the Gospel of Matthew), and two of the three lights in the east window in 1956. These show the virtues of Charity and Faith. ;Holy Trinity Church, High Hurstwood, East Sussex Ewan Christian designed the church in this hamlet in the parish of Buxted in 1870‚Äì72. Harry Mileham designed a window for the south side of the nave showing Saint Francis; it was installed in 1958, but Mileham had died the previous year. Paul Chapman added a window depicting Saint Christopher and Saint Luke in the north aisle in 1959. ;St Andrew's Church, Moulsecoomb, Brighton and Hove The church serving the Moulsecoomb housing estate in Brighton was completed in 1934. Many design elements refer to Saint Andrew's occupation of fisherman, including Cox & Barnard's stained glass which was installed throughout the church in and after 1998. The transepts have windows with four fish. There is also a window with a blue cross. ;St Andrew's Church, West Tarring, West Sussex In this old church serving a village which is now part of Worthing, the firm's designer Paul Chapman was responsible for the windows in the west end of the north and south aisles.

John Wycliffe is shown with a group of preachers. ;St Mary's Church, Hailsham, East Sussex Hailsham's 13th-century church lost its stained glass during World War II bombing raids. The firm designed the new four-light east window, depicting a Nativity scene, in 1954. ;St Michael and All Angels Church, Southwick, West Sussex The firm's designer Ken Adams supplied a memorial window for the north aisle of Southwick's parish church in about 1950. It shows the Presentation of Jesus. ;St Nicolas Church, Portslade, Brighton and Hove The ancient parish church of Portslade, now a suburb of Hove, has a Cox & Barnard window in its tower. Installed in 1946, it commemorates former verger A.C. Wheatland and depicts the church's patron saint Nicolas. ;St Philip's Church, Hove, Brighton and Hove Cox & Barnard supplied three windows at this Grade II-listed church of 1895 in the Aldrington area of Hove. The firm's designer Anthony Gilbert provided a window in the south chapel in 1955, depicting Saint George and commemorating parishioner George Howell. In 1960 Paul Chapman designed another window in the same part of the church, in memory of William Cheverton. Saint Cecilia is shown holding a musical instrument; she has \\"an unusual halo resembling yellow laurel leaves interspersed with roses\\". In the same year, a window commemorating Halcyon Ann Lopez and depicting the virtue of Charity, was designed in the firm's own name and installed in the south side of the nave. ;St Wilfrid's Church, Haywards Heath, West Sussex One source claims that Cox & Barnard were involved in the restoration of the stained glass in the west window and the north aisle windows at Haywards Heath's parish church, but they may in fact have worked on some of the other windows in the church. ;St Mary Magdalene's Church, Bolney, West Sussex A window at St Mary Magdalene's Church, Bolney Bolney's 11th-century parish church has one Cox & Barnard window in the south aisle, depicting a rural scene. It was installed in 1982. Roman Catholic churches ;Church of Our Lady Immaculate and St Michael, Battle, East Sussex Cox & Barnard designed the three stained glass windows in the south wall of the nave of this \\"somewhat unusual\\" Romanesque Revival church of 1886. Their first, dating from 1988, depicts the Battle-born Catholic martyr Thomas Pilcher. The Holy Family are shown on another from 1998, and the following year the firm supplied a Millennium window showing various saints and local views. ;Church of Our Lady of Gillingham, Gillingham, Kent The windows in Gillingham's Roman Catholic church represent a near- complete scheme by Cox & Barnard: there is only one older stained glass window by another firm. Represented in various windows in the chancel and nave, and dating from several years between 1980 and 1991, are Mary in various depictions (the Immaculate Mary, the Blessed Virgin and her Assumption into Heaven, and as Our Lady of Gillingham), Saint Raphael, Saint Gabriel, Saint Michael, Saint Alban, Saint Margaret Clitherow, Saint John Fisher, Saint Thomas of Canterbury and Saint Thomas More. ;Church of the Sacred Heart, Hove, Brighton and Hove This church of 1880‚Äì81 has an extensive scheme of murals and stained glass by Nathaniel Westlake, including his final work; but Cox & Barnard also designed a single window in 2001. It depicts Saint Francis and is in the centre light of the three in the west window. ;Corpus Christi Church, Henfield, West Sussex Only the east window in this modern church in the village of Henfield has stained glass. It was made in 1974, the year the church opened, and depicts a chalice surrounded by coloured glass. ;St Edward the Confessor's Church, Keymer, West Sussex Keymer's modern Roman Catholic church (built in 1973) has three windows by the firm: the first, depicting the Holy Spirit, was installed in the nave in 2002; others showing the Madonna and Child and Jesus with a group of children were made in 2005 and 2008. ;St Luke's Church, Hurstpierpoint, West Sussex Two panelled windows flanking the altar in Hurstpierpoint's church depict its patron saint Luke as a doctor and an artist respectively.

It took place in 1315 when a group of disaffected knights decided to revenge themselves on the Earl of Lancaster by attacking his chief retainer and their rival, Sir Robert de Holland. The group was led by Sir Adam Banastre of Bank Hall, Bretherton who had extensive landholdings in the county, Sir William de Bradshaigh of Haigh Hall and Sir Henry Lea of Charnock Richard. The cause of their grievance was that the powerful earl, the dominant force in the North-west of England, appeared to be favouring the Holland family to their disadvantage. The group met on 8 October 1315 at Wingates, in Westhoughton, where they planned an attack on the pro-Holland Radcliffes of Radcliffe. Adam de Radcliffe was captured and the raiding party moved to the home of Sir Henry de Bury looking for his brothers and Sir Henry de Bury was killed. The next day, having been joined by Sir Ralph Bickerstaff, the High Sheriff of Lancashire, they raided the farm of the bailiff of the Rector of Wigan, another Holland supporter, stealing crops and other goods. They then raided Norley Hall, belonging to a Lancaster adherent Thurstan de Norley, seizing goods and livestock. The mob traversed far and wide across south Lancashire, attacking the homes and property of the earl's supporters. Halton Castle in Cheshire was captured by burning down the gates and a failed attempt made to capture Liverpool Castle (then in the hands of Sir Robert Holland). Clitheroe Castle was taken and Preston terrorised. Eventually Edmund de Neville, the Deputy Sheriff of Lancashire, organised a force loyal to the earl and confronted the rebels at Deepdale in Preston. Within an hour the rebels were routed and Sir Ralph Bickerstaff killed. Joined by a force under Robert de Holland, Neville moved south to round up fugitives. Sir Adam Banastre and Sir Henry de Lea were captured at Charnock Richard after being betrayed and were summarily beheaded. Sir William Bradshaigh escaped, possibly to Wales, and was outlawed. After the Battle of Boroughbridge the Earl of Lancaster was executed at Pontefract and Sir Robert de Holland imprisoned. Sir William Bradshaigh was able to return to continue his feud with Sir Robert de Holland's successor, Sir Richard de Holland. Edward II had them arrested and Bradshaigh was imprisoned for several months. After Edward was overthrown in 1326, Sir Robert de Holland was released, only to be killed in 1328 by the new Earl of Lancaster's men for his treachery at Boroughbridge. Sir William Bradshaigh was killed in 1333 in a fight with the Radcliffes at Newton-le-Willows.

While a sparse matrix of dimension n can be represented efficiently in O(n) units of storage by storing only its non-zero entries, a non-sparse matrix would require O(n^2) units of storage, and using this type of matrices for large problems would therefore be prohibitively expensive in terms of storage and computing time. Hierarchical matrices provide an approximation requiring only O(n k\\\\,\\\\log(n)) units of storage, where k is a parameter controlling the accuracy of the approximation. In typical applications, e.g., when discretizing integral equations , preconditioning the resulting systems of linear equations , or solving elliptic partial differential equations , a rank proportional to \\\\log(1/\\\\epsilon)^\\\\gamma with a small constant \\\\gamma is sufficient to ensure an accuracy of \\\\epsilon. Compared to many other data-sparse representations of non-sparse matrices, hierarchical matrices offer a major advantage: the results of matrix arithmetic operations like matrix multiplication, factorization or inversion can be approximated in O(n k^\\\\alpha\\\\,\\\\log(n)^\\\\beta) operations, where \\\\alpha,\\\\beta\\\\in\\\\\\\\{1,2,3\\\\\\\\}.  Basic idea  Hierarchical matrices rely on local low-rank approximations: let I,J be index sets, and let G\\\\in{\\\\mathbb R}^{I\\\\times J} denote the matrix we have to approximate. In many applications (see above), we can find subsets t\\\\subseteq I,s\\\\subseteq J such that G_{t\\\\times s} can be approximated by a rank-k matrix. This approximation can be represented in factorized form G_{t\\\\times s}\\\\approx A B^* with factors A\\\\in{\\\\mathbb R}^{t\\\\times k},B\\\\in{\\\\mathbb R}^{s\\\\times k}. While the standard representation of the matrix G_{t\\\\times s} requires O((\\\\\\\\#t)(\\\\\\\\#s)) units of storage, the factorized representation requires only O(k(\\\\\\\\#t+\\\\\\\\#s)) units. If k is not too large, the storage requirements are reduced significantly. In order to approximate the entire matrix G, it is split into a family of submatrices. Large submatrices are stored in factorized representation, while small submatrices are stored in standard representation in order to improve efficiency. Low-rank matrices are closely related to degenerate expansions used in panel clustering and the fast multipole method to approximate integral operators. In this sense, hierarchical matrices can be considered the algebraic counterparts of these techniques.  Application to integral operators  Hierarchical matrices are successfully used to treat integral equations, e.g., the single and double layer potential operators appearing in the boundary element method. A typical operator has the form : {\\\\mathcal G}[u](x) = \\\\int_\\\\Omega \\\\kappa(x,y) u(y) \\\\,dy. The Galerkin method leads to matrix entries of the form : g_{ij} = \\\\int_\\\\Omega \\\\int_\\\\Omega \\\\kappa(x,y) \\\\varphi_i(x) \\\\psi_j(y) \\\\,dy\\\\,dx, where (\\\\varphi_i)_{i\\\\in I} and (\\\\psi_j)_{j\\\\in J} are families of finite element basis functions. If the kernel function \\\\kappa is sufficiently smooth, we can approximate it by polynomial interpolation to obtain : \\\\tilde\\\\kappa(x,y) = \\\\sum_{ u=1}^k \\\\kappa(x,\\\\xi_ u) \\\\ell_ u(y), where (\\\\xi_ u)_{ u=1}^k is the family of interpolation points and (\\\\ell_ u)_{ u=1}^k is the corresponding family of Lagrange polynomials. Replacing \\\\kappa by \\\\tilde\\\\kappa yields an approximation : \\\\tilde g_{ij} = \\\\int_\\\\Omega \\\\int_\\\\Omega \\\\tilde\\\\kappa(x,y) \\\\varphi_i(x) \\\\psi_j(y) \\\\,dy\\\\,dx = \\\\sum_{ u=1}^k \\\\int_\\\\Omega \\\\kappa(x,\\\\xi_ u) \\\\varphi_i(x) \\\\,dx \\\\int_\\\\Omega \\\\ell_ u(y) \\\\psi_j(y) \\\\,dy = \\\\sum_{ u=1}^k a_{i u} b_{j u} with the coefficients : a_{i u} = \\\\int_\\\\Omega \\\\kappa(x,\\\\xi_ u) \\\\varphi_i(x) \\\\,dx, : b_{j u} = \\\\int_\\\\Omega \\\\ell_ u(y) \\\\psi_j(y) \\\\,dy. If we choose t\\\\subseteq I,s\\\\subseteq J and use the same interpolation points for all i\\\\in t,j\\\\in s, we obtain G_{t\\\\times s} \\\\approx A B^*. Obviously, any other approximation separating the variables x and y, e.g., the multipole expansion, would also allow us to split the double integral into two single integrals and thus arrive at a similar factorized low-rank matrix. Of particular interest are cross approximation techniques that use only the entries of the original matrix G to construct a low-rank approximation.  Application to elliptic partial differential equations  Since the solution operator of an elliptic partial differential equation can be expressed as an integral operator involving Green's function, it is not surprising that the inverse of the stiffness matrix arising from the finite element method and spectral method can be approximated by a hierarchical matrix. Green's function depends on the shape of the computational domain, therefore it is usually not known. Nevertheless, approximate arithmetic operations can be employed to compute an approximate inverse without knowing the function explicitly. Surprisingly, it is possible to prove that the inverse can be approximated even if the differential operator involves non-smooth coefficients and Green's function is therefore not smooth.  Arithmetic operations  The most important innovation of the hierarchical matrix method is the development of efficient algorithms for performing (approximate) matrix arithmetic operations on non- sparse matrices, e.g., to compute approximate inverses, LU decompositions and solutions to matrix equations. The central algorithm is the efficient matrix- matrix multiplication, i.e., the computation of Z = Z + \\\\alpha X Y for hierarchical matrices X,Y,Z and a scalar factor \\\\alpha. The algorithm requires the submatrices of the hierarchical matrices to be organized in a block tree structure and takes advantage of the properties of factorized low-rank matrices to compute the updated Z in O(n k^2\\\\,\\\\log(n)^2) operations. Taking advantage of the block structure, the inverse can be computed by using recursion to compute inverses and Schur complements of diagonal blocks and combining both using the matrix-matrix multiplication. In a similar way, the LU decomposition can be constructed using only recursion and multiplication. Both operations also require O(n k^2\\\\,\\\\log(n)^2) operations.  H2-matrices  In order to treat very large problems, the structure of hierarchical matrices can be improved: H2-matrices replace the general low-rank structure of the blocks by a hierarchical representation closely related to the fast multipole method in order to reduce the storage complexity to O(n k). In the context of boundary integral operators, replacing the fixed rank k by block-dependent ranks leads to approximations that preserve the rate of convergence of the underlying boundary element method at a complexity of O(n). Arithmetic operations like multiplication, inversion, and Cholesky or LR factorization of H2-matrices can be implemented based on two fundamental operations: the matrix-vector multiplication with submatrices and the low-rank update of submatrices. While the matrix-vector multiplication is straightforward, implementing efficient low-rank updates with adaptively optimized cluster bases poses a significant challenge.

The major outbreak of violence took place on the night of Friday 10/11 July, with smaller disturbances on the following two nights. The riots were characterised by the Scarman report into the 1981 riots in England as \\"copycat riots\\" ‚Äì taking place after the Brixton riots in London, and around the same time as the Toxteth riots in Liverpool and the Moss Side riots in Manchester ‚Äì though some have argued that this is an oversimplification. The immediate flashpoint was an attack on a locally well-known Police Superintendent who was trying to calm rumours of an impending march by the right-wing National Front. The following disturbances resulted in 121 arrests and 40 injuries to police officers, alongside widespread damage to property. Before the riots Handsworth had been considered to be a good example of successful community policing, though local Black British youths later disputed the claim that relations between them and the police had been amicable: around 40% of them had been stopped and searched over the previous 12 months. Handsworth had a mixed population of white, black and Asian residents, but surveys after the riots showed little evidence of significant racial tension. A week before the riots, during the weekend that saw CS gas used against rioters for the first time on the British Mainland in Toxteth, Liverpool, a reporter from The Times had visited a festival in Handsworth Park and found \\"8,000 people, black and white\\" in \\"a spirit as amiable and peaceful as a rural village fete\\". The most common reasons for the riots reported by participants were unemployment, boredom and the imitation of events elsewhere.

Roald Dahl flew a Hawker Hurricane in the battle, which he describes in his second autobiography Going Solo and in the short story 'Katina'. According to Dahl, the battle began when the twelve remaining Hurricanes of the Royal Air Force (RAF)'s 80 Squadron, flying in formation over Athens, were attacked by a large group of German Luftwaffe aircraft, mostly Messerschmitt Bf 109s and Bf 110s along with some Junkers Ju 87s and Junkers Ju 88s. According to the citizens of Athens the Germans had 200 planes; according to Dahl, they had 152 bombers and fighters. In the resulting battle four RAF pilots were shot down and killed, including the famous Marmaduke \\"Pat\\" Pattle and the Irish RAF pilot William \\"Timber\\" Woods, and one pilot lost his Hawker Hurricane. Dahl states that Greek observers counted 22 German aircraft shot down, although another source states that the Germans lost eight aircraft. Dahl escaped from Greece with the remnants of his squadron.

The show was a mere 8 episodes, but is remembered as being the original do it yourself home improvement show.

A scene showed Bobby Villa in the heat of an argument with his right-hand man and former business partner Jorge Ramirez.

Things got even more heated when Villa referred to Ramirez as \\"Bean Burrito\\" for the duration of the episode. During the episodes following the \\"Bean Burrito\\" incident, Villa and Ramirez began to escalate the name calling and hostility. The words exchanged began as simple spiteful insults and eventually episodes were filled with racial slurs and profanity during the heated arguments. Public outrage began to mount as the episodes went on television profane and unedited. When interviewed by the local news team of WAGA-TV - Fox 5 Atlanta, Nixon (the producer also tasked with editing at the time) divulged that he had left the shows unedited on purpose.

The second Handsworth riots took place in the Handsworth district of Birmingham, West Midlands, from 9 to 11 September 1985. The riots were reportedly sparked by the arrest of a man near the Acapulco Cafe, Lozells and a police raid on the Villa Cross public house in the same area. Hundreds of people attacked police and property, looting and smashing, even setting off fire bombs. Handsworth had been the scene of a less serious riot four years earlier, when a wave of rioting hit over 30 other British towns and cities during the spring and summer of 1981. Racial tension and friction between the police and the local ethnic minority communities was seen as a major factor in the riots. Handsworth had been predominantly populated by the black and Asian communities for around 30 years by 1985. Handsworth also had one of the highest unemployment rates in Birmingham. Two brothers (Kassamali Moledina, 38, and his 44-year-old brother Amirali)\\"From the Archives: Police parking ticket sowed seeds for riots\\", Birmingham Mail, 14 July 2011. were burnt to death in the post office that they ran. Two other people were unaccounted for, 35 others injured, more than 1500 police officers drafted into the area, about 45 shops looted and burnt, and a trail of damage running into hundreds of thousands of pounds. As well as racial tension, unemployment was seen as a major factor in the riots; by the time of the riots, fewer than 5% of the black population to have left school that summer had found employment. The riots were the first of a series of similar riots across the country during the autumn of 1985, notably the Broadwater Farm riot in London which also resulted in a fatality (the murder of policeman Keith Blakelock). Filmmaker and artist Pogus Caesar extensively photographed the second Handsworth riot; it was also witnessed by Bronx graffiti artists Brim and Goldie, who documented the devastation in the Channel 4 documentary Bombing.

Militia units from nine states that were part of the Union by the end of the War of 1812 (Delaware, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Virginia), plus the District of Columbia, are the predecessors of eighteen units that currently exist in the Army National Guard. Two of the four units derived from Virginia militias are in the West Virginia National Guard; at the time of the War of 1812, West Virginia was still part of Virginia. Only two current units, the 155th Infantry, a component of the Mississippi National Guard derived from militia units organized in the Mississippi Territory and the 130th Infantry, a component of the Illinois National Guard derived from militia units formed in the Illinois Territory, are from states or territories west of the Appalachians. Unfortunately, no militia units from the states of Kentucky, Louisiana, Ohio or Tennessee, or from the Indiana, Michigan, Missouri or Louisiana Territories, where militia units played a major role in the fighting, have survived as units in the modern Army National Guard. There are also twenty- three active Regular Army battalions with campaign credit for the War of 1812. 198th Signal Battalion (ARNG DE) Distinctive Unit Insignia: 198 Sig Bn Campaigns: Delaware 1812, Delaware 1813, Delaware 1814 The 198th Signal Battalion is derived from the Delaware Regiment, constituted on December 9, 1775, and organized in early 1776 as Colonel John Haslet's Regiment. During the Revolutionary War, the regiment participated in fifteen campaigns. Three units created from the Delaware Regiment during the last decade of the eighteenth century saw service during the War of 1812: Light Infantry, 1st Infantry, 1st Regiment, 1st Brigade (mustered into federal service May 23, 1813, and mustered out on July 31, 1813, and mustered in again on August 28, 1814, and out between January 3 and March 13, 1815); the Artillery Company, 2nd Brigade (served from May 23, 1814, to September 2, 1814); and the 1st Company, Light Infantry, 8th Regiment, 3rd Brigade (in federal service from March 2, 1813, to May 4, 1813, from May 6, 1813, to July 31, 1813, and from August 6, 1814, to January 11, 1815).Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 198th Signal Battalion (First Delaware). The primary activity of the Delaware militia during the War of 1812 was defending coastal communities from raids by British landing parties during the blockade of the Delaware Bay and Delaware River beginning in early March 1813 and continuing into 1814.George 2000, p. 143. The militia units were continually shifted from one location to another in response to movements of the British ships. On March 6, 1813, the town of Lewes was threatened with destruction by the commander of the British flotilla if it failed to provide the British with supplies. The town refused the demand and was subjected to a twenty-two-hour bombardment beginning on April 6. A landing party was repulsed on April 7. The 1st Company, 8th Regiment, 3rd Brigade was present in Lewes from March 19, 1813, through March 24 and from May 3 through May 11, 1813, but not at the time of the British bombardment.;Peden 2003, pp. 1, 20, 39, 43, 47, 57, 63, 92, 131, 132, 219, 243, 337. the Artillery Company, 2nd Brigade was deployed to Lewes in early June.Peden 2003, pp. 7, 8, 30, 62, 63, 76, 92, 127, 240, 332. HHD/372nd Military Police Battalion (ARNG DC) Distinctive Unit Insignia: 372 MP Bn Campaigns: Fort Washington 1813, Bladensburg The HHD/372nd Military Police Battalion traces its formation to the First Legion, Columbian Brigade constituted in the District of Columbia on May 3, 1802, and organized during the summer of 1802 from existing volunteer militia companies north of the Potomac River. The unit was expanded, reorganized and redesignated on April 17, 1813, as the 1st Brigade, Columbian Division, to comprise two regiments. It was mustered into federal service on July 15, 1813, and mustered out on July 31, 1813, then mustered in again on July 19, 1814, and out on October 8, 1814.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors Certificate, Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment, 372d Military Police Battalion. During the Battle of Bladensburg, which culminated on August 24, 1814, the Columbian Division occupied the left portion of the second line of defense against the attacking British. When the first line of defense, which had been badly positioned by its commander, Brigadier General Tobias Stansbury, crumbled, the position of the Columbian Division became vulnerable. The division was able to resist the British advance for a while, but was forced to withdraw when its left flank came under attack.George 2000, pp. 99-102. In the absence of clear orders from the American commander of the Tenth Military District, Brigadier General William Winder, concerning what to do in the event that a retreat was necessary, the defenders fled the field. 118th Field Artillery (ARNG GA) Distinctive Unit Insignia: 118 FA Campaigns: Streamer without inscription The 118th Field Artillery traces its lineage back to four independent volunteer companies, three of foot and one of horse, organized in the Georgia Militia in the District to Savannah on April 18, 1751. The Georgia militia units in Savannah and surrounding Chatham County were reorganized in 1782 as the 1st Battalion, 1st Regiment, 1st Brigade, 1st Division. The main role of the Savannah militia during the War of 1812 was as a local defense force that remained under local control. However, three companies from the 1st Battalion were mustered into federal service during the early stages of the war: the Savannah Volunteer Guards (organized in 1802) and the Republican Blues (organized in 1808), mustered into federal service in east Florida in June 1812 as elements of Colonel Daniel Newman's provisional battalion of Georgia Volunteers and mustered out in October 1812; and the Heavy Artillery Company (organized in 1812), mustered in on October 19, 1812, at Fort James Jackson, Georgia, a fort one mile from Savannah, and mustered out on November 23, 1812.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 118th Field Artillery. The City Battalion of Savannah was mustered into service on January 22, 1815, as the 1st Regiment, Georgia Volunteers, and mustered out on February 23, 1815. This service came after the signing on December 24, 1814, of the Treaty of Ghent, the peace treaty that ended the war. However, neither the Americans nor the commander of the British fleet operating off the Georgia coast were aware of this event, and so elements of the Georgia militia were federalized to counter the British Cumberland Island Campaign (January‚ÄìMarch 1815), during which the British occupied Cumberland Island at the mouth of the St. Mary's River between Georgia and Florida.Malcomson 2000, pp. 131-133. 130th Infantry (ARNG IL) Distinctive Unit Insignia: 130 Inf Campaigns: Streamer without inscription The 130th Infantry traces its history back to March 1, 1809, when the Volunteer Militias of the Illinois Territory were constituted and organized as independent companies. The companies destined to become the 130th Infantry were mustered into federal service on February 18, 1813, as the Regiment of Illinois Territory Militia, and mustered out on June 16, 1813, following which elements reverted to independent status in the Illinois Territory Militia. The federalization of the Illinois Militia in early 1813 was a response to the massacre of two families on the Cache River near present-day Mound City by Creeks returning from the Battle of Frenchtown on the Raison River in Michigan. The primary function of the Illinois Militia during the War of 1812 was providing security for isolated settlements in areas of the territory inhabited by hostile Native tribes, especially the Potawatomi and the Kickapoo.Ferguson 2012, pp. 119-120, 126-128. The Illinois Militia was also mustered into federal service in 1831 as Duncan's Brigade, which included the 1st and 2nd Regiments of Illinois Mounted Volunteers, Major Bailey's Odd Battalion and Major Buckmaster's Battalion of Spies, all from central and southern Illinois, and again in 1832 for service in the Black Hawk War. After numerous reorganizations during the nineteenth century, these elements became the 4th Infantry Regiment in 1890, and subsequently the 130th Infantry in 1917.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 130th Infantry.http://www.history.army.mil/html/forcestruc/lineages/branches/inf/0130in.htm. The black hawk and two red arrows in the Distinctive Unit Insignia commemorate service in the Black Hawk War. The horizontal belt of red, white and green, the saltire from the Confederate flag and the fleur-de-lis represent service in the Mexican War, the Civil War and for service in France during World War I, respectively.Stein 1993, pp. 172-173 175th Infantry (ARNG MD) Distinctive Unit Insignia: 175 Inf Campaigns: Bladensburg, Maryland 1814 The 175th Infantry traces its lineage all the way back to the Baltimore Independent Cadets, a company of sixty \\"gentlemen of honour, family, and fortune\\" organized in 1774. In 1776 the Cadets were absorbed into William Smallwood's Maryland Battalion, which was later expanded and reorganized into the 1st through the 7th Maryland Regiments. These seven regiments earned credit for fourteen campaigns during the Revolutionary War. In 1794 the volunteer militia companies of Baltimore were reorganized as elements of the 5th Regiment of Militia. The 5th Regiment was in federal service from August 19, 1814, through November 18, 1814.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 175th Infantry (Fifth Maryland). During the Battle of Bladensburg, which culminated on August 24, 1814, the \\"Dandy Fifth,\\" along with other Maryland militia units, provided the first line of defense against the attacking British. As the British advanced, the 5th Maryland counterattacked, but when the 1st and 2nd Regiments on their left broke and fled, the 5th joined the rest of Maryland militia in a disorderly retreat from the field.George 2000, pp. 98-99. The 5th gave a much better account of itself on September 12, 1814, at the Battle of North Point, which was part of the Battle of Baltimore. The 5th Regiment held its position against the attacking British, and then conducted a successful fighting retreat that significantly slowed the British advance on Baltimore.George 2000, pp. 141-143. 101st Engineer Battalion (ARNG MA) Distinctive Unit Insignia:101 Eng Bn Campaigns: Massachusetts 1814 The 101st Engineer Battalion is one of the four oldest units in the U.S. Army, the other three being the 101st Field Artillery, the 181st Infantry and the 182nd Infantry, all from Massachusetts and all with credit for participation in the War of 1812 (see below). The 101st Engineer Battalion traces its origins to the East Regiment, organized in the Massachusetts Militia from existing train bands on December 13, 1636. The East Regiment became the Essex Regiment in 1643, and was then expanded in 1680 to form the 1st (South) and 2nd (North) Essex Regiment, and expanded again in 1689 to form the 1st (Lower), 2nd (Upper) and 3rd (Middle) Essex Regiments, and yet again in 1774 to form the 1st-6th Essex Regiments. During the American Revolution the six Essex Regiments were organized as the Essex County Brigade, to consist of eight regiments. The Essex County Brigade remained in state service during the Revolutionary War, but in addition formed five regiments that served in the Continental Army. In 1785 the Essex County Brigade was reorganized as the 2nd Division, consisting of the 1st and 2nd Brigades. During the War of 1812, flank companies of the 2nd Division were mustered into federal service as elements of the Elite Brigade during September-October, 1814. This was a time when the British navy was increasingly threatening coastal communities along the northern Atlantic seaboard.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 101st Engineer Battalion. The Massachusetts 1814 campaign credit awarded to the 101st Engineer Battalion was earned when Essex County units thwarted British attempts to put forces ashore in Essex County.Personal communication, Col. Leonid Kondratiuk, Director, Historical Services, Adjutant General's Office, MA. The badge in the blue stripe of the Distinctive Unit Insignia was the insignia of the old Essex Brigade.Stein, 1993, pp. 120-121. 101st Field Artillery (ARNG MA) Distinctive Unit Insignia: 101 FA Campaigns: Streamer without inscription The 101st Field Artillery traces its lineage back to the South Regiment, organized on December 13, 1636, from new and existing train bands in Boston, Dorchester, Roxbury, Weymouth and Hingham. It was redesignated as the Suffolk Regiment in 1643. The Suffolk Regiment was expanded in 1689 to form the Boston Regiment and the Suffolk Regiment. The 101st Field Artillery is derived from the Boston Regiment. While remaining in state service during the Revolutionary War, the Boston Regiment spawned Henry Jackson's Additional Continental Regiment, later designated as the 16th Massachusetts Regiment, which participated in five campaigns during the American Revolution. By 1810 the Boston Regiment had become the 3rd Brigade, 1st Division, consisting of the Battalion of Artillery (Volunteer Militia) and the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Regiments (Standing Militia). The Flank (Volunteer Militia) Companies of the 3rd Brigade, 1st Division were mustered into federal service during September and October, 1814, as elements of the Elite Brigade.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 101st Field Artillery (South Regiment); and personal communication, Col. Leonid Kondratiuk, Director, Historical Services, Adjutant General's Office, MA. The Massachusetts militia was one of the largest, best equipped and best trained of any of the state militias, but support for the war in New England was lukewarm at best. As a consequence, no Massachusetts units were federalized until 1814, although as state units they were active in guarding the state's coastline. Only after Great Britain burned Washington and generally increased its naval pressure on the East Coast did Massachusetts allow its militias to be mustered into federal service.Mahon 1972, pp. 219, 328-329. 181st Infantry (ARNG MA) Distinctive Unit Insignia: 181 Inf Campaigns: Streamer without inscription The 181st and 182nd Infantry Regiments are two of the oldest units in the U.S. Army, both tracing their origins all the way back to the North Regiment, organized in 1636 from militia units at Cambridge, Charlestown, Watertown, Dedham and Concord, and redesignated as the Middlesex Regiment in 1643. In 1680 additional companies from other towns were added, and the Middlesex Regiment was split into the 2nd (Upper) Middlesex Regiment, which ultimately became the 181st Infantry, and the 1st (Lower) Middlesex Regiment, which ultimately became the 182nd Infantry. By the time of the War of 1812, the 2nd Middlesex Regiment had become the 2nd Brigade, 3rd Division in the Massachusetts militia. Flank companies of the 2nd Brigade, 3rd Division served as elements of the Elite Brigade, which was mustered into federal service during September and October, 1814, for service in Boston.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 181st Infantry (Sixth Massachusetts). The 181st Infantry also perpetuates the lineage of the 104th Infantry, with which it was consolidated in 2006. The 104th Infantry traces its roots to the Hampshire Regiment, constituted in 1662, which later became the Hampshire and Berkshire County Brigades. By the time of the War of 1812 these two brigades had become the 4th and 9th Divisions, respectively. From these two divisions, five regiments were organized for federal service at Boston from September through November 1814.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 104th Infantry (Second Massachusetts). 182nd Infantry (ARNG MA) Distinctive Unit Insignia: 182 Inf Campaigns: Streamer without inscription The Middlesex Regiment, the origin of which is described above in the section on the 181st Infantry, was split into the 1st (Lower) and 2nd (Upper) Middlesex Regiments in 1680. The 1st Middlesex Regiment ultimately became the 182nd Infantry, while the 2nd Middlesex Regiment became the 181st Infantry. By the time of the War of 1812, the 1st Middlesex Regiment had become the 1st Brigade, 3rd Division in the Massachusetts militia. Flank companies of the 1st Brigade, 3rd Division were mustered into federal service as elements of the Elite Brigade, which served at Boston during September and October 1814.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 182d Infantry (North Regiment). The 182nd Infantry also perpetuates the lineage of the 101st Infantry, with which it was consolidated in 1992. The 101st Infantry traces its roots to the Columbia Artillery in the Legionary Brigade of Boston, organized in 1798. This unit was also assigned to the Elite Brigade during September and October 1814.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 101st Infantry (Ninth Massachusetts). The mobilization of militia units in Boston during the fall of 1814 was a response to increased activity of the British navy along the eastern seaboard beginning in the late summer. The British raid on Washington and the attack on Fort McHenry and the attempted occupation of Baltimore had sparked fears of attacks of other Atlantic ports. However, no attack materialized, and in October the British ended their campaign in the Chesapeake Bay.Mahon 1972, p. 311. 772nd Military Police Company (ARNG MA) Distinctive Unit Insignia: 211 MP BN Campaigns: Streamer without inscription The 772nd Military Police Company traces its origins to the Cohannet Train Band, Plymouth Colony Militia. Organized on March 3, 1638, and redesignated as the Taunton, Massachusetts Train Band in 1639, it is the oldest company-level unit in the United States Army. The unit's first major military action was during King Philip's War (1675‚Äì1676), a conflict between the colonists and a confederation of Indian tribes organized by a Wampanoag chief named Metacom, but referred to as King Philip by the colonists, to resist expansion of white settlements in southern New England. By 1703 the Taunton Train Band had assumed the honorific title \\"First Military Company,\\" and in 1785 it became the 1st Foot Company, 3rd Regiment, 2nd Brigade, 5th Division. Under the command of Captain Joseph Reed, Jr., the 1st Company was mustered into service on September 6, 1814, at a time when an invasion by the British was feared, and served for thirty days.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 772d Military Police Company. (http://www.history.army.mil/html/forcestruc/lineages/branches/mp/0772mpco.htm) The company was deployed to New Bedford.Pearson 1913, p. 60. Since companies are not issued Distinctive Unit Insignia, the 772nd Military Police Company wears the Distinctive Unit Insignia of the 211th Military Police Battalion, in which it serves. 972nd Military Police Company (ARNG MA) Distinctive Unit Insignia: 211 MP BN Campaigns: Massachusetts 1814 The 972nd Military Police Company traces its history back to the Gloucester Artillery Battery, Battalion of Artillery, 1st Brigade, 2nd Division organized in 1787 in the Massachusetts Militia at Gloucester. Under the command of Captain James S. Sayward, the Gloucester Artillery Battery was mustered into federal service on September 9, 1814, for service at Gloucester, and was mustered out on October 29, 1814.Department of the Army, Worksheet, 972nd Military Police Battalion, and personal communication, Col. Leonid Kondratiuk, Director, Historical Services, Adjutant General's Office, MA During the late summer and autumn of 1814, following the British attacks on Washington and Baltimore, the British fleet off the east coast of the United States became much more active and were regularly threatening coastal communities with bombardment and invasion. The Gloucester Artillery was awarded credit for the Massachusetts 1814 Campaign for action against British Marines from HMS Leander attempting to land near Gloucester.Pearson 1913, p. 9. As in the case of the 772nd Military Police Company (see above), personnel from the 972nd Military Police Company wear the Distinctive Unit insignia of the 211th Military Police Battalion, the battalion in which it serves. 133rd Engineer Battalion (ARNG ME) Distinctive Unit Insignia: 133 Eng Bn Campaigns: Massachusetts 1812, 1813, 1814 Although the 133rd Engineer Battalion has a lineage that goes back only to 1854, the Headquarters Company traces its history to the formation of the Portland Light Infantry in 1803. By the War of 1812 the Portland Light Infantry had become Captain Nathaniel Shaw's Company, 3rd Regiment, 2nd Brigade, 12th Division in the Massachusetts Militia. The 3rd Regiment was mustered into federal service from September 7, 1814, through October 3, 1814, at Portland.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 133rd Engineer Battalion (Twentieth Maine); Pearson 1913, p. 243; and personal communication, Col. Leonid Kondratiuk, Director, Historical Services, Adjutant General's Office, MA. The population of the District of Maine, still a part of Massachusetts in 1812, was not enthusiastic about the War of 1812, and the lower part of the state, which shared the Mainers lack of enthusiasm for the war, was not in a good position to defend Maine against a serious campaign by the British or even to supply its militia. Indeed, much of the Maine coast down to Eastport was occupied by the British. As a consequence the defense of Maine fell to a small, poorly equipped militia.Mahon 1972, pp. 219, 328-335. Nonetheless, during the early autumn of 1814 when the British navy aggressively threatened coastal communities along the entire northeastern seaboard, the District of Maine Militia successfully defended Portland against a British invasion. The three campaign credits for the Headquarters Company/133rd Engineer Battalion were awarded to Captain Shaw's Company for its participation in the defense of Portland, while in both federal and state service, during the years 1812,1813 and 1814.Personal communication, Col. Leonid Kondratiuk, Director, Historical Services, Adjutant General's Office, MA. 155th Infantry (ARNG MS) Distinctive Unit Insignia: 155 Inf Campaigns: Florida 1814, New Orleans The 155th Infantry traces its lineage back to the Legions of Militia, Upper and Lower Districts, Mississippi Territory, constituted on September 8, 1798. On October 25, 1798, the Legion of Militia of the Lower (or Southern) District was organized as the Militia of Adams County, which was reorganized and redesignated as the 1st Regiment, Mississippi Territorial Militia in 1802. By the late summer of 1812, the 1st Regiment, Mississippi Territorial Militia had become the 1st Regiment, Mississippi Territorial Volunteers. Between early 1813 and mid-1814 the 1st Regiment underwent a number of reorganizations and redesignations, and spent a period of time in federal service between September 1812 and April 1814. But this service did not result in the award of any campaign credits for the War of 1812. The War of 1812 campaign credits awarded to the 155th Infantry were earned by six Mississippi militia units mustered into federal service from September 1814 through January 1815 for service in Major General Andrew Jackson's Coast Campaign: Lieutenant Colonel J. Carson's Regiment of Volunteer Mounted Gunmen, Lieutenant Colonel D. Neilson's Infantry Detachment, Lieutenant Colonel T. Hinds' Squadron of Light Dragoons, Captain J. C. Wilkins' Natchez Volunteer Rifle Corps, Captain Boyle's Company of Volunteer Mounted Spies, and Major J. P. Kennedy's Company of Choctaw Indians.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 155th Infantry. Of the six Mississippi militia units in the lineage of the 155th Infantry, Hinds' Dragoons was the one most involved in the Battle of New Orleans.Remini 1999, pp. 74, 125, 185. During the night attack on December 23 the Dragoons provided valuable reconnaissance that located the British encampment on LaCoste's Plantation, and during the major battle on January 8 they were in reserve just one mile behind the breastworks that comprised Jackson's front line. The Dragoons also participated in the last land fighting of the battle during a skirmish with the British rear guard near the mouth of Bayou Bienvenue on January 25. The cross in the chief (the upper third) of Distinctive Unit Insignia symbolizes service in the War of 1812.Stein 1993, p. 175. 113th Infantry (ARNG NJ) Distinctive Unit Insignia: 113 Inf Campaigns: Streamer without inscription The 113th Infantry traces its history back to the 1st New Jersey Regiment, which was organized in the Continental Army in part from existing militia companies from Essex County between October 26 and December 15, 1775. The regiment was assigned to the New Jersey Brigade for service in the American Revolution, during which it participated in ten campaigns. The regiment was reorganized and redesignated as the New Jersey Regiment on March 1, 1783, furloughed on June 6, 1783, and disbanded on November 15, 1783. In 1793 it was reorganized again in the New Jersey militia and expanded to form the Essex Brigade. Elements of the Essex Brigade were mustered into federal service during 1814.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 113th Infantry (First New Jersey). Essex County is in northeastern New Jersey. Because of the proximity of this part of New Jersey to New York City, the New Jersey militia was an integral part of the force that defended New York Harbor against invasion by British warships. In addition to serving at strategically located fortifications along the New Jersey shore, such as Sandy Hook, Paulus Hook and the Highlands of Navesink, some New Jersey militia units were also posted to forts in New York, and a few were deployed on Delaware Bay. When not mustered into United States service, elements of the New Jersey militia were often deployed as independent militia by the governor to locations on the New Jersey coast.Guernsey 1889, p. 343. 53rd Army Digital Liaison Team (ARNG NY) Distinctive Unit Insignia: 53 ADLT Campaigns: Streamer without inscription The 53rd Army Digital Liaison Team traces its origin to four companies of artillery, commanded by Captains Henry Morgan, James Hewitt, John Fleming and John Forbes, organized during May and June 1806 in New York City. The formation of these four companies was an impassioned reaction by the residents of New York City to the arrival in April off Sandy Hook of three British warships, which proceeded to board and search all American vessels entering New York Harbor. On April 25 over twenty American vessels entered the Harbor, whereupon the British fired over a hundred shots at the Americans before boarding and searching as many as they could. The shelling caused the death of one sailor.Clark 1890, p. 44. On July 26, 1806, these four artillery companies were assigned to the Battalion of Artillery, 1st Artillery Brigade, which was expanded and redesignated on April 5, 1807, as the 3rd Regiment of Artillery. The four aforementioned companies were reorganized and redesignated on August 25, 1808, as the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Regiment of Artillery, which was reorganized and redesignated as the 2nd Battalion, 11th Regiment of Artillery on June 13, 1812. This regiment was mustered into federal service twice during the War of 1812: September 15, 1812, through December 15, 1812, and September 2, 1814, through December 2, 1814.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 107th Support Group (Seventh New York). The HHD/107th Support Group has recently been reorganized and redesignated several times and is now the 53rd Army Digital Liaison Team. During its first period of federal service, the 2nd Battalion, 11th Regiment was stationed on Ellis Island and Bedloe Island (later renamed Liberty Island); during its second stint, at the North Battery, a fort in New York City.Clark 1890, pp. 63-64, 76-77. The mobilization during the fall of 1814 was a response to increased activity of the British fleet along the eastern seaboard during the summer, followed by the raid on Washington and the attacks on Fort McHenry and Baltimore. These actions by the British stoked fears of attacks or invasions at other important ports on the East Coast. Following their decisive defeat at Baltimore, however, the British cut back on their activities in the Chesapeake Bay, with much of the fleet withdrawing to Jamaica and refitting for action along the Gulf Coast.Mahon 1972, pp. 339-340. The 7th Regiment was the designation of the 53rd Army Digital Liaison Team from 1847 through 1917, at which time it was redesignated as the 107th Infantry. The 7th Regiment is one of the National Guard's most storied regiments. Indeed, it was the first militia unit to refer to itself as the \\"National Guard.\\" This occurred in August 1825 when the 2nd Battalion, 2nd Regiment of Artillery, to honor the Marquis de Lafayette on the day of his departure from New York, adopted the name \\"National Guards\\" in honor of the Garde Nationale de Paris, which was at one time commanded by Lafayette. The \\"s\\" was soon dropped. In 1847 the unit was redesignated the 7th Regiment, and in 1862 the term \\"National Guard\\" was appropriated by the state for the uniformed militia. Personnel of the 53rd Army Digital Liaison Team wear the Distinctive Unit Insignia of the New York Army National Guard Headquarters. 258th Field Artillery, (ARNG NY) Distinctive Unit Insignia: 258 FA Campaigns: Streamer without inscription The 258th Field Artillery traces its lineage back to the 4th Regiment of Artillery, which was organized in the New York militia from existing units in New York City on October 9, 1809. On June 13, 1812, the 4th Regiment of Artillery was redesignated as the 3rd Regiment of Artillery. The 3rd Regiment of Artillery was mustered into federal service between September 15, 1812, and December 15, 1812, and again between September 2, 1814, and December 3, 1814.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 258th Field Artillery (Washington Greys). The primary mission of the New York City militia units was to prevent the British from entering New York Harbor and possibly occupying the city. The defense of New York Harbor was organized around a series of forts constructed on islands in the harbor, including Bedloe Island and Governors Island, and a number of forts in the city. In addition, the defense of New York Harbor was augmented by several fortification constructed at strategic locations on the New Jersey shore. The batteries of the 3rd Regiment of Artillery were assigned to several of the New York forts during the course of the war.Guernsey 1889, pp. 60-80, 84-90. 103rd Engineer Battalion (ARNG PA) Distinctive Unit Insignia: 103 Eng Bn Campaigns: Streamer without inscription The 103rd Engineer Battalion traces its origins to December 7, 1747, when the Military Association of the City of Philadelphia, founded on November 21, 1747, by Benjamin Franklin, was officially recognized. The artillery companies of the Associators were combined to form the Train of Artillery of Philadelphia on December 29, 1747. The Train of Artillery of Philadelphia was reorganized as the Philadelphia Artillery Battalion in 1775, units of which earned credit for participation in thirteen campaigns during the Revolutionary War. In 1794 the Philadelphia Artillery Battalion was expanded as the Regiment of Artillery of the City of Philadelphia, which was mustered into federal service from August 1814 through January 1815 as the Regiment of Artillery, consisting of six companies: the Junior Artillerists, the Company of Independent Artillerists, the 2nd Company of Independent Artillerists, the Northern Liberty Artillerists, the Frankford Volunteer Artillerists and Capt. Landis's Company of Volunteer Artillerists.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 103d Engineer Battalion (The Dandy First). The last four months of 1814 was a period of increased activity of the British naval forces on the Chesapeake and Delaware Bays, prompting the mobilization of a number of militia units from the Philadelphia area. The red lion in the Distinctive Unit Insignia denotes service in the War of 1812.Stein 1993, p. 121. HHT/2-104th Cavalry (ARNG PA) Distinctive Unit Insignia: 104 Cav Campaigns: Streamer without inscription The 104th Cavalry traces its beginnings to June 30, 1874, when it was constituted as the 8th Infantry Regiment, and organized in August of that same year in south-central Pennsylvania. However, the Headquarters and Headquarters Troop of the 2nd Squadron has a much earlier origin.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, HHT/2-104th Cavalry. The HHT/2-104th Cavalry traces its lineage back to the Reading Union Volunteers, organized on March 23, 1794. The Reading Union Volunteer served in the Whiskey Rebellion. During the War of 1812 the Reading Union Volunteers were mustered into federal service on September 12, 1814, as the Reading Washington (Guards) Blues, in response to the British attack on Fort McHenry and Baltimore, and mustered out on February 8, 1815.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, Headquarters Company, 337th Engineer Battalion, draft document. The last four months of 1814 was a period of time when the British navy was very active all along the Atlantic coast, especially in the Chesapeake Bay, and the Americans feared attacks on its coastal cities. The Guards were initially ordered to Philadelphia to defend the city against a possible attack by the British that never materialized, after which they were attached to the Advance Light Brigade, 1st Regiment of Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry and deployed along the Delaware River.Department of Military and Veteran Affairs, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Lineage and Honors of the Reading Artillerists. The HHC/337th Engineer Battalion has recently been reorganized and redesignated as the HHT/2-104th Cavalry. 111th Infantry (ARNG PA) Distinctive Unit Insignia: 111 Inf Campaigns: Streamer without inscription The 111th Infantry traces its origins to the Associators, founded in 1747 in Philadelphia by Benjamin Franklin. The Associators were created as a volunteer militia unit to defend Philadelphia against French privateers operating on the Delaware River. In 1747 the Associators were reorganized, minus the artillery companies (which became the Train of Artillery of Philadelphia and ultimately the 103rd Engineer Battalion - see above), as the Associated Regiment of Foot of Philadelphia. In 1775 the Associated Regiment of Foot became the Associators of the City and Liberties of Philadelphia; and in 1777, the Philadelphia Brigade of Militia, which participated in four campaigns during the American Revolution. On April 11, 1793, the Philadelphia Brigade was reorganized as the 1st Brigade, 1st Division, which was mustered into federal service as the 1st Regiment on August 24, 1814, at Philadelphia and mustered out on January 4, 1815.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 111th Infantry (The Associators). The period from mid-August 1814 until the end of the war was a time when the British naval forces on the Chesapeake Bay and Delaware Bay were very active, conducting the successful raid on Washington and the unsuccessful attack on Baltimore. The Pennsylvania militia units from the Philadelphia area that were federalized at this time were used to augment the defense of Baltimore and the Delaware River, but did not see action.George 2000, p. 128. 263rd Army Air and Missile Defense Command (ARNG SC) Distinctive Unit Insignia: 263 ADA Campaigns: Streamer without inscription The 263rd Army Air and Missile Defense Command traces its roots to the Artillery Company of Charles Town, organized in 1756 and chartered by the colony of South Carolina on July 31, 1760. In 1775 the Artillery Company was expanded, reorganized and redesignated as the Charles Town Battalion of Artillery, which served in the American Revolution until Charleston was surrendered to British forces on May 12, 1780. It was reconstituted in 1783 as the Charleston Battalion of Artillery. In 1794 the Charleston Battalion of Artillery became the 1st Regiment of Artillery. During the War of 1812 the Provisional Battalion, 1st Regiment of Artillery was mustered into federal service at Charleston on November 6, 1814, and mustered out on March 3, 1815, by which time the war had ended.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 263rd Aird Defense Artillery. The mission of the Charleston militia was to defend the important port of Charleston from attack by British ships.Mahon 1972, pp. 110-112. At the time when the Provisional Battalion, 1st Regiment of Artillery was mustered into federal service late in 1814, there had been an increase in activity of the British fleet along the eastern seaboard, and a possible invasion was feared. However, Charleston was not attacked, and the Provisional Battery did not participate in any combat.Malcomson 2006, p. 536. HHT/2-183rd Cavalry (ARNG VA) Distinctive Unit Insignia: 183 Cav Campaigns: Virginia 1813 The 183rd Cavalry dates back only to 2005, when it was organized from former elements of the 111th Air Defense Artillery. However, the Headquarters and Headquarters Troop/2-183rd Cavalry is much older, having been derived from the Headquarters and Headquarters Battery/3-111th Air Defense Artillery, which has a lineage that goes back to 1792, when the Portsmouth Rifles was organized in Norfolk County as a company in the 7th Regiment, Virginia Militia.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, Headquarters and Headquarters Troop, 2-183rd Cavalry. Militia companies in the Norfolk area, including companies from the 7th Regiment, were mobilized in February and June 1813 for local defense, and again between August 1814 and February 1815 in anticipation of a British attempt to occupy Norfolk.Butler 1988, pp. 154-154, 240-241. In an action preliminary to the invasion of Norfolk, the British attempted a landing on Craney Island, a low-lying point of land near the mouth of the Elizabeth River, on June 22, 1813, where they were soundly defeated. Following their repulse at Craney Island, the British abandoned their plans to attack Norfolk and turned their attention to Portsmouth instead.Malcomson 2006, pp. 124-126. When not mobilized, the Norfolk County units continued to serve as local defense units under county regimental authority. 276th Engineer Battalion (ARNG VA) Distinctive Unit Insignia: 276 Eng Bn Campaigns: Virginia 1813 The 276th Engineers trace their origin to the Richmond City Regiment organized in May 1791 from existing elements of the Virginia Militia. The Richmond City Regiment was reorganized and redesignated as the 19th Regiment on December 31, 1791. While remaining in state service, the 19th Regiment formed the First Corps d'Elite Brigade of Virginia Militia (Colonel Thomas Mann Randolph commanding), which was mustered into federal service in 1813 and mustered out in 1814. The First Corps d'Elite Brigade consisted of the Richmond Volunteers, the Flying Artillery (Captain William Wirt commanding), the Rifle Company (Captain William H. Richardson commanding) and the Richmond Light Infantry Blues.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 276th Engineer Battalion (First Virginia). (http://www.history.army.mil/html/forcestruc/lineages/branches/eng/0276enbn.htm) The First Corps d'Elite Brigade, along with other Virginia militia units from Chesterfield and Henrico Counties, was federalized in March and June 1813, at a time when the British seemed to be preparing an invasion of Virginia along the James River and possibly even attacking Richmond. The invasion along the James never materialized, but the British did threaten Norfolk and Portsmouth. The threat to Norfolk ended when the British attempt to occupy Craney Island in June was soundly defeated (see HHT/2-183 Cavalry above). Some elements of the Richmond militia were mobilized again during the summer of 1814 and sent to Richmond and Norfolk, at a time when increased activity of the British fleet along the eastern seaboard had stoked invasion fears in coastal cities.Butler 1988, pp. 68-70, 183-185. 150th Cavalry (ARNG WV) Distinctive Unit Insignia: 150 Cav Campaigns: Indiana Territory 1812-1813 The 150th Cavalry traces its formation back to the Militia of Greenbrier County, Virginia, constituted in 1778 from Minutemen companies organized for frontier defense in 1777. Drafts from these companies provided Virginia regiments for the Continental Line during the period 1777 through 1782. In 1792 Greenbrier and Kanawha County militia units were reorganized as volunteer companies in the 13th Brigade, Virginia Militia. In September 1812 five companies from the 13th Brigade from the part of Virginia that would later become Cabell, Greenbrier, Kanawha and Mason Counties in present-day southern West Virginia were consolidated with seven companies from the area that is currently northern West Virginia to form the 2nd Regiment, Virginia Volunteer Militia. These companies were separated again in 1863 when the new state of West Virginia reorganized its forces, and units from the southern counties (Cabell, Greenbrier, Kanawha and Mason Counties) became part of the 2nd Division (150th Cavalry lineage), while those from the northern part of the state (Hampshire, Harrison, Monongalia and Randolph Counties) were assigned to the 1st Division (201st Field Artillery lineage - see below).Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 150th Cavalry (Second West Virginia). During the War of 1812, companies from the 2nd Regiment served at Richmond and Norfolk and in Ohio and the Indiana Territory with the Army of the Northwest.Butler 1988, pp. 61, 96, 115, 134. Virginia companies aided in the construction of Fort Meigs near the Maumee Rapids, but were not present when the fort was attacked by Indians and the British in the spring of 1813.Butler 1988, pp. 16-17. War of 1812 campaign credit for the 150th Cavalry was awarded for service in the Indiana Territory. One of the five stars in the Distinctive Unit Insignia commemorates service during the War of 1812.Stein 1993, p.90. 201st Field Artillery (ARNG WV) Distinctive Unit Insignia: 201 FA Campaigns: Indiana Territory 1812-1813 The 201st Field Artillery traces its origin to militia companies formed in the northern and western part of the Virginia Colony, the earliest of which was Captain Morgan Morgan's Company of Volunteer Militia of Orange Country, Virginia, organized on February 17, 1735. During the Revolutionary War several militia companies from this part of Virginia were organized for frontier defense and for service in Virginia regiments of the Continental Line. One such company, Capt. Hugh Stephenson's Company of Virginia Riflemen, which was organized in 1775, became a part of the 1st Virginia Regiment, American Continental Troops and earned credit for participation in the Boston and New York (1776) campaigns. In 1792 the militia companies from this part of Virginia were reorganized as companies in the 1oth and 16th Brigades, Virginia Militia, which served in the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794. In September 1812 seven companies from the 10th and 16th Brigades, from counties in northern Virginia that would later become Hampshire, Harrison, Monongalia and Randolph Counties in West Virginia, were combined with five from what is now southern West Virginia (see 150th Armor above) to form the 2nd Regiment, Virginia Volunteer Militia, thereby combining the lineages of the 150th Cavalry and 201st Field Artillery. The lineages of the 150th Cavalry and 201st Field Artillery were separated again in 1863 when companies from the northern part of the new state of West Virginia were reorganized as companies in the 1st Division, West Virginia Militia (201st Field Artillery lineage), while those from the southern part of the state were assigned to the 2nd Division (150th Cavalry lineage).Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 201st Field Artillery. During the War of 1812 most of the troops from companies in the lineages of the 201st Field Artillery served in the Army of the Northwest in 1812 and 1813, but some also served at Richmond and Norfolk.Butler 1988, pp. 16-17, 100, 104-105, 142-143, 182.

She was based in Gibraltar from 1950 until 1954 when she was sold to Turkey. Her Turkish owner, the Denizcilik Bankasƒ± renamed her Hora and used as a salvage tug in service four year long from 1954 in Istanbul, and for ten years in ƒ∞zmir.

Most Ligia species live in tidal zone cliffs and rocky beaches, but there are several fully terrestrial species in high humidity environments. Ecology Coastal Ligia exhibit a mixture of terrestrial and marine characteristics, drying out easily, needing moist air and proximity to water to retain water. While they have gills and can exchange gas under water, they only do so when escaping terrestrial predators or being dislodged by wave action. They do not move swiftly in the water and are open to marine predation. They are well adapted to rocky surfaces and avoid sand which opens them to terrestrial predation and desiccation.  Species  Species separation is at times difficult because of sexual dimorphism. For example, males usually have longer and wider antennae than females, although this is often not the case. The male also tends to be larger but narrower, sometimes attributed to the female‚Äôs brood pouch. Complicating matters is the possible existence of cryptic species in the genus.

In February 2011, she released the perfume as a sister scent to Heat (2010). While Heat is billed as an \\"overtly sexy\\" fragrance, Heat Rush is intended to be more for daytime use. It contains various floral and fruity scents in its three types of notes and is meant to showcase Beyonc√©'s sensuality and parts of her personality. The fragrance is packaged in an orange falcon. Background and design New fragrance project working sessions took place backstage in Newcastle upon Tyne, England in November 2009. During the new fragrance project working sessions, Beyonc√© deciphered through different scents, later choosing a \\"Sunset Cocktail Mod 5\\" scent because it made her feel \\"as though a breeze were coming through the room\\" and seemed \\"like more of a risk\\". During an interview Honorine Blanc declared that \\"a woman in love with Heat Rush is in control of her personality and sensuality\\". Blanc revealed that the orange color was very important to the fragrance's bottle design, for its vibrancy and energy that it adds to the scent, and added that Beyonc√©'s sensuality as well as sexuality inspired the perfume's re-release. Blanc also commented that the construction of the scent's bottle is very important, as it needed to find the right balance where everything works together. Blanc took on an appreciation for Beyonc√© while working with her, stating that her drive is what inspired her to work on the fragrance more. She stated: > Beyonc√©, she lives her passion. She's so sensual, and she's so powerful. And > she puts it out there, she's not afraid of it. She's very involved in the > fragrance. She knows what she wants. I always had more feedback from her; I > always had to have more signature and stronger all the time. Conception Heat Rush is a fruity floral fragrance that is luminous and vibrant with a dewy delicacy at the same time. It is set to capture Beyonc√©'s \\"bright sensuality\\"; it is summarized as \\"young, fresh, and joyful\\". In the fragrance's top notes, Heat Rush uses top notes of passion fruit, blood orange and brazilian cherry. The scent's heart notes, set to embody Beyonc√©'s \\"ultra- feminine\\" side with a floral bouquet built upon a combination of yellow tiger orchid, mango blossom and orange hibiscus. The scent finishes in its base notes with teak wood, honey amber and a Musk accord that is inspired by the sunsets in Brazil. As stated by Beyonc√©'s, \\"Heat is a spicier scent and is bursting with the Red Vanilla Orchid. Heat Rush is fresher and lighter and the Yellow Tiger Orchid is the top note in the fragrance. I love them both for different reasons but they both feature my favorite flower, which is the orchid.\\" She further stated that \\"It may be too much like fruit. Everyone's not gonna like it, but I like it... It's too safe... It's sexy, I like it\\". Heat Rush is presented in a \\"sophisticated and dazzling\\" bright orange flacon. The shapely, feminine base narrows to an elegant gold top with the word \\"Heat\\" emblazoned on its center. The fragrance itself is a golden hue noted to emulate the sun. This theme is continued throughout the outer packaging accompanied by warm-toned accents, as described by the Houston's Style Magazines staff members. Beyonc√©'s official perfume website describes Heat Rush intent and purpose, stating \\"Heat Rush shines, sparkles and excites the moment it touches the skin. Surrounded by a luminous fragrant aura, the woman who wears it feels instantly effervescent and alive. Sensual and bright, the scent lights up a room just as Beyonc√© captivates with her presence.\\" According to Steve Mormoris, Senior Vice President of Marketing, Coty Beauty, \\"This fragrance is inspired by the bright and subtle sensuality that transcends every aspect of Beyonc√©'s life.\\" Beyonc√© commented on the scent's \\"Rush\\" aspect stating: \\"I created Heat Rush to bring the feeling of warmth and sensuality to every woman who wears it. It's feminine and sexy, fresh and beautiful.\\" Promotion and reception Following the release of Heat Rush, Beyonc√© released new candids to promote the fragrance featuring photos of the fragrance itself and of her posing with the bottle. In the visual campaign, which was photographed by professional photographer Michael Thompson, Beyonc√© is seen wearing a tangerine-colored dress, with \\"a hypnotic and mesmerizing gaze\\". The shoot is set to accentuating Beyonc√©'s \\"soft femininity and undeniable sensuality\\"/ After the scent's release, all commercials for Heat were later altered to include Heat Rush release towards their ends.

In keeping with contemporary Christian views on contraception, the dissemination of information and the possession of materials relating to birth control were illegal in Canada. The trial was the first successful legal challenge, and it marked the beginning of a shift in Canadian society's acceptance towards such practices (McLaren and McLaren, 85-87). On September 14, 1936, 28-year-old Dorothea Palmer was arrested in Eastview (now Vanier, Ontario), where a large number of French and Irish citizens made up the town's population of about 4,000. Palmer was charged under section 207 of the Criminal Code for possessing and distributing materials and pamphlets related to birth control. As she was working for the Kitchener-based Parents' Information Bureau (PIB), her arrest could have led to the collapse of the organization and as many as two years' imprisonment for Palmer. However, the PIB was the brainchild of industrialist A.R. Kaufman, a eugenically-minded industrialist, whose family founded Kaufman Rubber Company. His support financial support and the hiring of defense attorney F. W. Wegenast would eventually see Palmer's charges dropped. The trial lasted from September 1936 to March 1937. Ultimately, the case was dismissed by the presiding magistrate Lester H. Clayton, who ruled that, as Palmer's actions were \\"in the public good,\\" no charges could be held against her.. In his final ruling, he explained that: > The mothers are in poor health, pregnant nine months of the year ... What > chance do these children have to be properly fed, clothed and educated? They > are a burden on the taxpayer. They crowd the juvenile court. They glut the > competitive labour market. Although contraception was not fully legalized in Canada until 1969, Palmer was the only person to be prosecuted for providing information about birth control.
