Biography He was born about 1460 or 1470 in Poland, and died at Lublin in 1541. He was a pupil of Jacob Margolioth of Nuremberg, with whose son Isaac he officiated in the rabbinate of Prague about 1490; but he first became known during the latter part of the activity of Judah Minz (d. 1508), who opposed him in 1492 regarding a question of divorce. Pollak's widowed mother-in-law, a wealthy and prominent woman, who was even received at the Bohemian court, had married her second daughter, who was still a minor, to the Talmudist David Zehner. Regretting this step, she wished to have the marriage annulled; but the husband refused to permit a divorce, and the mother, on Pollak's advice, sought to have the union dissolved by means of the declaration of refusal (mi'un) on the part of the wife, permitted by Talmudic law. Menahem of Merseburg, a recognized authority, had decided half a century previously, however, that a formal letter of divorce was indispensable in such a case, although his opinion was not sustained by the Oriental rabbis. When, therefore, Pollak declared the marriage of his sister-in-law null and void, all the rabbis of Germany protested, and even excommunicated him until he should submit to Menahem's decision. Judah Minz of Padua also decided against Pollak, who was sustained by one rabbi only, Me√Ør Pfefferkorn, whom circumstances compelled to approve this course (Judah Minz, Responsa, No. 13; Gr√§tz, Gesch. 2d ed., ix. 518). Pollak had a further bitter controversy, with Minz's son Abraham, regarding a legal decision, in which dispute more than 100 rabbis are said to have taken part (Ibn Ya·∏•ya, Shalshelet ha-·∏≤abbalah, ed. Amsterdam, p. 51a). Legacy After the accession of King Sigismund I in 1506, many Jews left Bohemia and went to Poland, founding a community of their own at Krak√≥w. Pollak followed them, officiating as rabbi and organizing a school for the study of the Talmud, which, up to that time, had been neglected in Poland. This institution trained young men to introduce the study of the Talmud into other Polish communities. In 1530 Pollak went to the Holy Land, and on his return took up his residence at Lublin, where he died on the same day as his opponent, Abraham Minz. His most famous pupils were Rabbi Shalom Shachna of Lublin and Me√Ør of Padua (Maharam Padua). Pollak, in transferring the study of the Talmud from Germany, where it had been almost entirely neglected in the sixteenth century, to Poland, initiated a movement which in the course of time dominated the Talmudic schools of the latter country. The sophisticated treatment of the Talmud, which Pollak had found in its initial stage at Nuremberg, Augsburg, and Regensburg, was concerned chiefly with the mental gymnastics of tracing relationships between things widely divergent or even contradictory and of propounding questions and solving them in unexpected ways. =Works= Neither he nor Rabbi Shalom Shachna, one of his most famous students, authored any books. The latter's son Rabbi Israel Shachna said that neither his father nor his father's rebbe wished to bind future generations to their rulings, and cited other rabbis who likewise had refrained from committing their legal ruling to book form. Pollak's contemporaries were unanimous in regarding him as one of the great men of his time, although the exaggerations to which his method eventually led were later criticized with severity (comp. Gans, \\"·∫íema·∏• Dawid,\\" ed. Offenbach, p. 31a). Pollak himself, however, was not responsible for these, since he modestly refrained from publishing the decisions at which he arrived by his system, not wishing to be regarded as a casuist whose decisions were to be implicitly followed. Only a few quotations from him are found in the works of other authors.

Biography=Life and film career= Duncan was of MƒÅori descent and was raised in Auckland and attended Avondale College. Duncan completed many home videos but finished only two short films, DFK6498 and Strike Zone. The former dealt with his cancer diagnosis and subsequent loss of freedom, drawing analogy between the limitations imposed by the disease and a prison sentence. The latter film was devoted to his love of softball. Both films received recognition at the Wanganui Rivercity Film Festival. In 2002 DFK6498 won the best script and the viewers choice awards, with Duncan winning the best director award, while in 2003, Strike Zone won the best film award. He was also successful in the Fair Go Ad Awards, with his entries in 1999 and 2003 winning the award for best high school entries in their respective years. The advertisement he created for the 1999 competition was officially adopted by TVNZ and played on television for its message concerning road safety. He flew to Tijuana, Mexico for alternative treatment for his bone cancer. He died in Texas at age 17. =Relationship with Lord of the Rings= Near the end of his life he befriended Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh. His illness also helped to inspire Fran Walsh to write the lyrics for the Oscar-winning song, \\"Into the West\\" for the film The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. After his death, his work as well as an explanatory documentary was put onto the Extended Edition DVD set for The Return of the King. On the set of The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, he received blessings from Viggo Mortensen and Sir Ian McKellen as well as a signed photo from John Rhys-Davies. He was going to make a cameo in the film, but as his health deteriorated, it became impossible for him to do so. =Legal battle after death= Duncan's family have made approaches through the NZ ethics system to use his frozen sperm. His sister and her female partner want to use the sperm and it is alleged that his mother has ownership rights.

Baxley, written by twin brothers Carey and Chad Hayes. It stars Melissa Joan Hart, with real-life spouses Daniel Baldwin and Isabella Hoffman. The movie also stars Meadow Sisto, David Lascher, and R&B;/pop star Jeremy Jordan. The picture made its debut on May 13, 1996 9/8c on NBC. The film is based on the 1990 murders of the parents of 14-year-old Jessica Wiseman. Jessica had her 17-year-old boyfriend, Douglas Christopher Thomas, shoot and kill her parents. Thomas was executed in 2000, when the death penalty for juveniles was still a legal punishment. Plot Repressed teenager Jennifer Stanton (Hart) is constantly at odds with her exceedingly-strict parents, who intensely dislike Jennifer's friends as well as her taste in clothing. Her father William (Baldwin) is an aggressive control-freak; his attitude has an adverse impact upon Jennifer's relationships, particularly with Brad (Lascher) - the captain of her high school football team. Brad ultimately breaks up with Jennifer, ostensibly because William keeps them apart, but also because another girl at school has him interested. Jennifer is shocked and frustrated by all of this. Jennifer meets Nick Ryan (Jordan) at a gas station and soon forms a close relationship with him, which she keeps secret from her parents. Nick has a reputation for having spent time in jail on an assault charge. When Jennifer's parents spend a weekend away from the house, Jennifer uses the opportunity to get closer with Nick. Not trusting Jennifer, her parents return home early. They catch her in their bed with Nick. William furiously chases Nick out of the house, although Jennifer insists that she's in love with him. She continues dating Nick secretly, and uses makeup to convince him that William gave her a black eye. Concerned, Nick asks Jennifer to stay with him. She is touched by his offer, but declines. Back home, Jennifer's mother Susan (Hoffman) expresses disgust with the girl for having sex behind her parents' backs. She takes William's side against their daughter and her friends. Jennifer is grounded for the rest of the school year. Nick visits Jennifer's house, and proclaims his love for her. He also states what he thinks of the harsh manner in which William treats Jennifer. William, shocked by Nick's audacity, threatens to sue him for statutory rape. He also threatens Nick with dire physical injury. The next morning, William finds his car vandalized and contacts the police. Nick is questioned, but denies all knowledge of the incident. Jennifer, knowing of her father's determination to have Nick imprisoned, convinces him to get his grandfather's pistol and kill her parents. While he plans out the murder, Jennifer tells her friends at school that she and Nick have broken up. She also presents herself to William and Susan as their idea of a model teenager. Although convinced that Jennifer has reformed and become truthful, her dad and mom couldn't care less. On the night for which they've scheduled her parents' murder, Nick reconsiders the plan at the last moment; with Jennifer's vehement encouragement, however, he goes through with it. After the killings, which the police presume were done by a burglar, Jennifer is sent to live with her grandmother Rose. Nick, the prime suspect, is harassed by the cops. Jennifer rekindles her relationship with Brad. She calls the police anonymously with information that leads to their discovery of the gun with which Nick murdered her parents. With Nick in custody, the case seems to be closed. However, Detective Daniels (Eric Laneuville) suspects that Jennifer knows more regarding this case than she let on during police interrogation. When confronted, Jennifer claims that Nick was angry at her parents for not letting him see her, thereby explaining Nick's motive. Meanwhile, Jennifer's best friend Karen Winkler (Sisto) finds her diary; it reveals how Jennifer used Nick to do away with her parents so that she could have Brad. Karen visits Nick in jail, and tells him how he's been set up by Jennifer. When he confronts Jennifer about it, she angrily blows Nick off, blaming him entirely for the murders of her dad and mom. Upset, he admits to the police that he killed William and Susan, but that it was Jennifer's idea. The police claim Jennifer's diary as evidence, only to find that she has rewritten the journal and thus made it useless. Frustrated, Karen sneaks into Jennifer's house to search for additional evidence; she fails to discover anything, and narrowly escapes being caught in the act. At Nick's murder trial, Jennifer falsely testifies that Nick harassed her. When Karen's determination to stop her becomes apparent, Jennifer threatens to implicate her in the murders of William and Susan. Eventually, a wired Brad manipulates Jennifer into admitting responsibility for her parents' deaths. The police pop in to arrest Jennifer for murdering her dad and mom. An epilogue reveals that Jennifer Stanton was tried as a juvenile; thus, her release from prison at age 21 would be mandatory...while Nick Ryan is now on death row.

Will had been a member of the short-lived Santa Cruz/San Francisco, California band No Options. No Options had broken up suddenly upon the death of member Chad W. Rickley. All of Born/Dead's records have been dedicated to his memory and they still play No Options songs in their live set. Born/Dead's style of DIY punk is influenced by hardcore punk, peace punk and some crust punk. They sound similar to Aus Rotten, Econochrist and Tragedy. In 2001, after playing extensively in the San Francisco Bay Area, the band released their debut five-song 7\\" EP 24 Hostages as the first release by No Options Records, a label started by Will. After recording the initial tracks for a full-length album themselves, the band approached the long- running and successful Bay Area label, Prank Records to release the record. The nine-song Our Darkest Fears Now Haunt Us LP/CD was released in 2003 and featured a heavier sound than the debut. The LP's release lead the band to its first major U.S. tour and was quickly followed by a recording session at Burnt Ramen studios produced by Nate Smith and Greg Wilkinson of Brainoil, these songs were released on a split LP with Seattle's Consume, released on German label Yellowdog Records. This was followed closely by a 5-week tour of Europe with Consume. Note: Levon from Shitlist, Deathraid played drums on the European tour. In 2004, original drummer Bill Jackson left the band to concentrate on his other group Strung Up and was replaced by Josh Carman. The band prepared new material and in 2005 returned with a limited edition five- song 12\\" EP which they sold on a series of tours in the United States and Europe. This new material was more experimental than previous releases and some songs were re-released on a 7\\" EP on Prank Records. In 2006, the band toured the west coast with The Subhumans and World Inferno Friendship Society. They Followed this a split 7\\" EP on Tankcrimes records with San Francisco's Peligro Social. Will is also involved in No Options Records. Born/Dead completed recording of a new 7 song LP entitled \\"The Final Collapse\\" at Ear Hammer studios in Oakland, and was scheduled to tour throughout most of 2007 to 2008 in over 28 countries, this tour saw the Markley Hart Econochrist play the Australian and New Zealand leg of tour with Pisschrist. In 2009 Born/Dead toured 5 weeks in Europe with Mackey Iveli of Peligro Social on drums. 2014 Born/Dead toured 7 countries in 12 days.

It is responsible for issuing the national currency, the Tanzanian shilling. The bank was established under the Bank of Tanzania Act 1965. However, in 1995, the government decided that the central bank had too many responsibilities, and was thus hindering its other objectives. As a result, the government introduced the Bank of Tanzania Act 1995, which gave the bank the single objective of monetary policy. It is governed by a board of directors consisting of ten people, four of whom are ex officio members which have three advisory committees that can assist them. The bank is headed by its Governor, assisted by three deputy governors in Administration, Economic and financial policies and Financial stability.  History  The Bank of Tanzania was chartered by the first parliament of Tanzania through the Bank of Tanzania Act of 1965 following the dissolution of the East African Currency Board in 1965. The bank commenced operations on June 14, 1966 and was inaugurated by the first president of Tanzania, Mwalimu Julius Kambarage Nyerere. = Arusha declaration = Immediately after its formation, the Arusha declaration was proclaimed and the traditional roles of the bank was modified to accommodate for the changes in economic system. The lack of competition in the financial markets meant the bank had to reorient its role in the economy. After 1971 The Exchange Control Ordinance and Import Control Ordinance allowed the bank to apply the following plans: * The Annual Finance and Credit plan allowed the bank to freely control interest rates and was the main act that allowed the bank to administer monetary policy * The Foreign Exchange Plan to control the use of foreign exchange to protect national interests and protect the local currency from devaluation With increased villagisation during the time period and the continued weakness in the balance of payment of the bank, the Bank of Tanzania act was amended in 1978 to give the bank more control. The Act shifted the responsibility of financial planning from the ministry of finance and planning directly to the bank. = Liberalization = Following the liberalization of the economy in 1995 and the rapid rate of inflation and devaluation in the Tanzanian shilling, the Bank of Tanzania act of 1995 was passed which clarified the primary objective of the central bank to establish a monetary environment to ensure Price stability. The act was further clarified in 2006 and is the current governing act for the bank.  Organizational structure = The Board of Directors = The Bank of Tanzania has a board of directors consisting of 10 people. Four of the members are directly appointed by the President of Tanzania. The ministry of Finance and the Principal secretary to the treasury of the Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar also appoint a member each to the board. The current board composition consists of the following: * Governor, who is the chairman of the board * Three Deputy Governors, whose roles are determined by the Governor * Representative from the ministry of finance and planning * Four non-executive directors, and * the Secretary to the board  List of Governors  Below is a list of the seven Bank of Tanzania Governors with six former governors and one acting governor: # Edwin Mtei ‚Äì 1966 to 1974 # Charles Nyirabu ‚Äì 1974 to 1989 # Gilman Rutihinda ‚Äì 1989 to 1993 # Idris Rashidi ‚Äì 1993 to 1998 # Daudi Ballali ‚Äì 1998 to 8 January 2008 # Benno Ndulu ‚Äì 8 January 2008 to 7 January 2018 # Florens Luoga ‚Äì 8 January 2018  Branch Network  The bank is headquartered in Dar es salaam in the heart of the financial district of the city and also maintains the following 6 branches in the following cities: #Arusha #Mbeya #Mwanza #Zanzibar #Dodoma #Mtwara The last branch was opened in Mtwara due to the recent economic growth in the southern regions.  Financial inclusion  The bank is active in promoting financial inclusion policy and is a leading member of the Alliance for Financial Inclusion. It is also one of the original 17 regulatory institutions to make specific national commitments to financial inclusion under the Maya Declaration during the 2011 Global Policy Forum held in Mexico. In 2016 the central Bank Chief Professor Benno Ndulu renewed the bank's commitment by launching the National Financial Inclusion Framework (NFIF),2016-2020. The objective is to reduce the number vulnerable households due to low unstable incomes, low confidence and self- exclusion from the current 28.2 per cent. Training and Continuous Professional Development The bank also has its own training institute located in Mwanza.  Criticism  Recently, Bank of Tanzania was involved in an incident which resulted in an audit of its External Arrears Account. About Tshs were discovered to have been lost in 2005 through dubious payments. As a result, the President of Tanzania fired the bank's Governor, D. T. S. Ballali, on 2008. Professor Benno Ndullu was appointed to take this position on the same day.

Archaically agaric meant 'tree-fungus' (after Latin agaricum); however, that changed with the Linnaean interpretation in 1753 when Linnaeus used the generic name Agaricus for gilled mushrooms. Most species of agarics are within orders of and describe the members of the order Agaricales in the subphylum Agaricomycotina. The exceptions, where agarics have evolved independently, feature largely in the orders Russulales, Boletales, Hymenochaetales and several other groups of the overarching phylum Basidiomycetes. Old systems of classification place all agarics in the Agaricales and some (mostly older) sources use \\"agarics\\" as the colloquial collective noun for the Agaricales. Contemporary sources now tend to use the term euagarics to refer to all agaric members of the Agaricales. \\"Agaric\\" is also sometimes used as a common name for members of the genus Agaricus, as well as for members of other genera; for example, Amanita muscaria is sometimes called \\"fly agaric\\".

The film was based on the play of the same name by Bogosian and Tad Savinar. Portions of the film and play were based on the assassination of radio host Alan Berg in 1984 and the book Talked to Death: The Life and Murder of Alan Berg by Stephen Singular.Chicago Reader The film was entered into the 39th Berlin International Film Festival, where it won the Silver Bear. Plot Barry Champlain, a Jewish radio personality in Dallas, Texas, is a host with a caustic sense of humor and a knack for condescending to his audience with his controversial political views. Champlain's radio show is about to go nationwide. A former suit salesman, he achieves his rise to fame through guest shots on the Jeff Fisher radio show. Barry begins to steal the show with his acerbic sense of humor and sharp wit, which aggravates Fisher. Barry is subsequently given his own show which rises to the top of the Arbitron radio ratings. Barry receives calls from people who appreciate him for what he does and how he does it as well as people who seem to hate him. Attacking everyone from gays to drug addicts to rednecks to African Americans, he has a substantial number of hostile callers, from people who take offense to his attitude to radical right wingers to hate groups phoning in to harass and intimidate him. He receives threatening fan mail when one caller makes a bomb threat. His rise to fame is accompanied not only with attention from radical far-right elements, but also with the alienation of his wife. As his show is going through a final audition to go into national syndication, Barry grows increasingly isolated and asks his ex-wife Ellen to come and visit him, saying he needs her input and that she's the only person he trusts. They attempt a return to their relationship. Using a fake name and calling from the radio studio, Ellen talks to Barry on the air‚Äîthe only place he seems to relate to people openly‚Äîin an attempt to reach him, to bring him back from the depression he seems to be suffering from. She begs for him to come back, but Barry refuses, bitterly attacking her as the radio production staff, all friends of Ellen, watch in horror; Ellen walks away. Barry confesses his true intentions, admitting he cares more for personal gain than the societal ills he addresses and refusing to apologize for his hypocrisy. He shouts that the American people scare him because of what has happened to his friends, family, and co-workers. He berates his callers that they have nothing worth saying, and that they tolerate his abuse and return for more. He screams at them to go away, seemingly unaware of the obvious fact that he attracts his own listeners and most of the ire he receives. In the end he realizes he has made his own bed and is as stuck with them as they are with him. Despite Barry's meltdown, his co-workers tell him it's now the highest rated segment in the show's history and his boss adds that the show is going to go national. While Barry is walking to his car, an apparent fan asks for his autograph. As Barry signs it, the \\"fan\\" pulls out a gun and shoots him several times, killing him. As the film ends, callers to Barry's show, then his co-workers and Ellen, speak on air about him. They say that Barry was a talented, smart and funny man, but none of that mattered; he hated himself, and his death wish was finally granted.

The script was almost entirely based on Bogosian's original play with some biographical information about Alan Berg, a talk show host in Denver who was murdered in 1984 by white supremacists. In his research for the film version, Bogosian often watched the on-air production of Tom Leykis' talk show, then originating from Los Angeles station KFI. Bogosian's fictional character shares many speech patterns and mannerisms with real-life talker Leykis. Filming took place mostly in Dallas, Texas and Irving, Texas. Unlike the film, the original play takes place entirely during the on-air broadcast and there are no scenes outside the radio station. Reception Talk Radio received mostly positive reviews from critics On Rotten Tomatoes the film has a \\"Certified Fresh\\" approval rating of 82% based on 49 reviews, with an average rating of 7.06/10. The consensus summarizes: \\"The gripping union of a director and star at the peak of their respective powers, Talk Radio offers the viewer a singularly unlikable character and dares you to look away.\\" See also * List of American films of 1988 * Private Parts-the 1997 satirical comedy about shock DJ Howard Stern * Talk radio ReferencesBibliography * Rossi, Umberto. ‚ÄúAcousmatic Presences: From DJs to Talk-Radio Hosts in American Fiction, Cinema, and Drama‚Äù, Mosaic, 42:1, March 2009, pp. 83‚Äì98.

Michener, published in 1980. The novel is set in South Africa, home to five distinct populations: Bantu (native Black tribes), Coloured (the result of generations of racial mixture between persons of European descent and the indigenous occupants of South Africa along with slaves brought in from Angola, Indonesia, India, Madagascar and the east Coast of Africa), British, Afrikaner, and Indian, Chinese, and other foreign workers. The novel traces the history, interaction, and conflicts between these populations, from prehistoric times up to the 1970s. Plot summary Michener writes largely from the point of view of the Afrikaners, descendants of Dutch settlers and French Huguenot immigrants who traveled to South Africa to practice freedom of worship in the Calvinist tradition, and other European groups (such as the Germans), all of whom were absorbed by the Afrikaans-speaking Dutch Reformed Church. The Afrikaners, whose Dutch ancestors first established a trading and refueling stop at Cape Town in the 17th century to service ships moving between Holland and Java, and whose ranks were augmented by Huguenot and other northern European immigrants, considered themselves the \\"New Israelites\\". They found in the Old Testament verification for their belief that God favored their conquest of the new land. Their strict, fundamentalist interpretation of the Bible supported them through the Great Trek of the 19th century; battles against Zulu and other Bantu tribes, who also laid claim to lands to the north; the Anglo-Boer War (when after the British won the war on the conventional battlefield and took all the main Boer towns and cities, a few Boer Commandos or guerrilla bands of a few hundred Afrikaner farmers continued to hold out in isolated pockets of the veld until the cessation of hostilities, despite tens of thousands of British regulars combing the countryside in pursuit of them); and their institution of Apartheid in the 20th century, when they insisted on racial purity, separatism, and white supremacy, per the moral expectations of the God of Israel in the Old Testament and their own determination to keep political power in the hands of Whites of European descent. Michener suggests that the Afrikaner oppression of Blacks was partly due to Dutch animosity towards the English, who assumed political and financial control of southern Africa in 1795 and fought against the traditional way of life, including slavery, pursued by Afrikaner farmers, or Boers. As one Bantu character observes, \\"no matter whether the English or the Dutch win, the Blacks always lose.\\" Both historical and fictional characters appear throughout the novel. The experiences of the fictional van Doorn family illustrate the Dutch and Huguenot heritage of South Africa, and in the 1970s also illustrate the differences between liberal and conservative Afrikaners. The fictional Saltwood family represents the English settlement of the area. The Nxumalo family illustrates the area's black heritage and culture. African Zulu leader Shaka appears in the novel, during the chapter on the Mfecane. ReferencesExternal links *The Making of the Covenant Category:1980 American novels Category:Novels by James A.

The poem is the first of his 1819 odes, which include \\"Ode on a Grecian Urn\\" and \\"Ode to a Nightingale\\". \\"Ode to Psyche\\" is an experiment in the ode genre, and Keats's attempt at an expanded version of the sonnet format that describes a dramatic scene. The poem serves as an important departure from Keats's early poems, which frequently describe an escape into the pleasant realms of one's imagination. Keats uses the imagination to show the narrator's intent to resurrect Psyche and reincarnate himself into Eros (love). Keats attempts this by dedicating an \\"untrodden region\\" of his mind to the worship of the neglected goddess. Background Keats was never a professional writer. Instead, he supported himself with a small income that he earned as a surgeon for Guy's Hospital. At the age of 23, Keats left the hospital, losing his source of income, in order to devote himself to writing poetry. He lived with Charles Brown, a friend who collected Keats's poetry while supporting him, during spring 1819 and composed poetry. The early products of this effort included La Belle Dame sans Merci and \\"Ode to Psyche\\", the first of a series of odes that he would write that year. It is uncertain as to when the poem was actually completed,Bate 1963 p. 484‚Äì525 but Keats sent the poem to his brother on 3 May 1819 with an attached letter saying, \\"The following poem, the last I have written, is the first and only one with which I have taken even moderate pains; I have, for the most part, dashed off my lines in a hurry; this one I have done leisurely; I think it reads the more richly for it, and it will I hope encourage me to write other things in even a more peaceable and healthy spirit.\\"Keats 2008 pp. 161‚Äì162 Keats was exposed to a few sources of the Psyche myth. His contemporary sources for the myth included Lempriere's Classical Dictionary and Mary Tighe's Psyche, an 1805 work that Keats read as a child and returned to in 1818. Keats wrote to his brother George, just a few months before writing \\"Ode to Psyche\\", to say that he was no longer delighted by Tighe's writing. Dissatisfied, he turned to Apuleius's Golden Ass, translated by William Adlington in 1566, and read through the earlier version of the Cupid and Psyche myth. After reading the work and realizing that the myth was established during the twilight of Roman mythology, Keats wrote to George:Bate 1963 pp. 487‚Äì489 \\"You must recollect that Psyche was not embodied as a goddess before the time of Apuleius the Platonist who lived after the Augustan age, and consequently the Goddess was never worshipped or sacrificed to with any of the ancient fervour‚Äîand perhaps never thought of in the old religion‚ÄîI am more orthodox than to let a heathen Goddess be so neglected.\\"Keats 2008 p. 162 Structure \\"Ode to Psyche\\", Keats's 67 line ode, was the first of his major odes of 1819. As such, the poem is an experiment in the ode structure that he was to then rely on for his next five odes. Although Keats spent time considering the language of the poem, the choice of wording and phrasing is below that found within his later works, including Hyperion or the odes that followed.Bate 1963 p. 487 \\"Ode to Psyche\\" is important because it is Keats's first attempt at an altered sonnet form that would include longer more lines and would end with a message or truth. Also, he did not want the poem to be based simply around that message, so he incorporated narrative elements, such as plot and characters, along with a preface to the poem. Of these additions, the use of a preface was discontinued in his next odes along with the removal of details that describe setting within the poems; they would only be implied within later odes.Bate 1963 p. 490‚Äì491 H. W. Garrod, in his analysis of Keats's sonnet form, believes that Keats took various aspects of sonnet forms and incorporated only those that he thought would benefit his poetry. In particular, Keats relies on Petrarch's sonnet structure and the \\"pouncing rhymes\\" that are found within Petrarch's octave stanzas.Garrod 1926 pp. 85‚Äì90 However, M. R. Ridley disputes that Keats favours Petrarch and claims that the odes incorporate a Shakespearean rhyme scheme.Ridley 1933 202‚Äì204 Regardless of which sonnet structure was favoured over the other, Keats wanted to avoid the downsides of both forms. \\"Ode to Psyche\\" begins with an altered Shakespearean rhyme scheme of . The use of rhyme does not continue throughout the poem, and the lines that follow are divided into different groups: a quatrain, couplets, and a line on its own. These are then followed by a series of twelve lines that are modelled after the Shakespearean sonnet form, but lack the final couplet. The next lines are of two quatrains, with rhyme, followed by two lines that repeat the previous rhymes, and then a final quatrain, with rhyme.Bate 1962 pp. 129‚Äì130 Poem The poem does not describe the plot of the original Cupid and Psyche myth: according to Harold Bloom, the poem \\"has little to do with the accepted myth\\".Bloom 1993 p. 399 In the original myth, Aphrodite punishes Psyche, a well admired girl, by having Cupid use his power to make her fall in love. Cupid, instead, falls in love with her, but he could only be with her in the cover of darkness in order to disguise his identity. Curious, she uses a light to reveal Cupid's identity, but he flees from her presence. Psyche begins to search after Cupid, and Aphrodite forces her to perform various tasks before she could be united with her love. After nearly dying from one of the tasks, Cupid asks Zeus to transform Psyche into a goddess so the two can be together. The action of \\"Ode to Psyche\\" begins with a narrator witnessing two individuals embracing. The narrator immediately recognizes Cupid and is astonished when he recognizes Psyche:Bloom 1993 pp. 399‚Äì400 The third stanza describes how Psyche, though a newer Goddess, is better than the other deities. However, she is neglected while the others were worshipped:Bloom 1993 p. 400 The previous list of what Psyche lacks in terms of religious worship only describes external symbols of worship. In the fourth stanza, the narrator emphasizes the internal when he describes how he is inspired by Psyche:Bloom 1993 pp. 400‚Äì401 The narrator, inspired by the young goddess, becomes her priest. His imagination allows him to join with both the natural and supernatural elements of Psyche, and his form of worship is within himself while \\"Ode to Psyche\\" the poem serves as a song in praise of the goddess. The narrator becomes the prophet for Psyche and says in the final stanza:Bloom 1993 pp. 401‚Äì402 In the conclusion of the poem, the narrator metaphorically says that he will expand his consciousness, which would allow him to better understand both the good and the bad of the world. This will allow the narrator to attain a new sense of inspiration while providing Psyche with a sanctuary:Bloom 1993 pp. 402‚Äì404 Theme The moment that Cupid and Psyche are revealed is an example of \\"Keatsian intensity\\" as they are neither in a state of separation nor are they united; they exist in a state somewhere in betweenBloom 1964 p. 90 in a similar manner to the figures depicted in Keats's \\"Ode on a Grecian Urn\\". The narrator's ability to witness the union is unique to Keats's version of the Psyche myth because the lovers in the original story were covered in darkness. However, the narrator questions if he was able to see them at all or if he was dreaming. This inability of the narrator to know if he was awake is a theme that appears in many of Keats's odes that followed, including \\"Ode on Indolence\\", \\"Ode on a Grecian Urn\\", and \\"Ode to a Nightingale\\". Regardless of the narrator's state of consciousness, he is able to relate himself to Cupid as he believes himself to be in love with Psyche, representing the mind.Bate 1963 pp. 490‚Äì491 Part of the problem within \\"Ode to Psyche\\" is in the narrator's claim that Psyche was neglected since she became a goddess later than the other Greco-Roman deities.Bate 1963 p. 491‚Äì493 As such, the narrator serves as a prophetic figure who is devoted to the soul. Worship towards the soul is through use of the imagination, an idea that shows the influence of William Wordsworth upon the poem's themes. In particular, the lines are reminiscent of the description of inspiration and the muse within Wordsworth's \\"The Recluse\\".Bloom 1964 p. 95 To serve Psyche, the narrator of \\"Ode to Psyche\\" seeks to worship her by thoroughly exploring the regions of his mind. However, the temple dedicated to the goddess within his mind does not yet exist.Bate 1963 pp. 492‚Äì493 This reveals that there is a struggle between the acceptance of imaginative experience that exists only within a small part of the mind.Perkins 1959 pp. 222‚Äì228 This struggle, according to Walter Evert, has \\"no relevance to the world of external action and perhaps no truth to offer even the visionary dreamer himself.\\"Evert 1965 p. 307 However Anthony Hecht looks at the problem in a different way and believes that there must be a connection between the external and internal worlds for the narrator to even face the problem.Hecht 1962 p. 65 Regardless, the narrator never states that this worship of Psyche or embracing the imagination would aid mankind, but the poem does rejoice in exercising the imagination.Evert 1965 pp. 307‚Äì308 In addition to the theme of dedicating one's self to the mind, the theme of reception plays heavily upon the poem's presentation; Andrew Bennett states that the poem, like all poems, is \\"'heard' both by itself (and therefore not heard) and by an audience that reads the poem and 'hears' it differently\\".Bennett 1994. p. 130 Bennett implies that the word \\"wrung\\" in line one contains a double entendre as it also alludes to the \\"ringing in the ears\\" involved with active listening. The poem's treatment of the reader as a third-party to the conversation between the narrator and the goddess exemplifies the narrative question common among many of Keats's odes and leads Bennett to question how exactly the reader should regard his place within the poem, or outside of it.Bennett 1994. pp. 130‚Äì131 Critical reception Responding to the poem, Keats's friend Leigh Hunt declared that \\"When Mr Keats errs in his poetry, it is from the ill management of the good things,-- exuberance of ideas. Once or twice, he does so in a taste positively bad, like Marino or Cowley, as in a line in his 'Ode to Psyche'... but it is once or twice only, in his present volume.\\"Matthews 1971 qtd. pp. 171‚Äî172 Robert Bridges, turn of the 19th-century literary critic, wrote \\"for the sake of the last section (l. 50 to end), tho' this is open to the objection that the imagery is work'd up to outface the idea‚Äîwhich is characteristic of Keats' manner. Yet the extreme beauty quenches every dissatisfaction. The beginning of this ode is not so good, and the middle part is midway in excellence.\\"Bridges 1972 p. 131 Later, T. S. Eliot thought very highly of Keats's work and wrote \\"The Odes‚Äîespecially perhaps the Ode to Psyche‚Äîare enough for his reputation.\\"Eliot 1964 p. 11 Kennet Allott, in defending against any possible harsh criticism of \\"Ode to Psyche\\", argues that the poem \\"is the Cinderella of Keats's great odes, but it is hard to see why it should be so neglected, and at least two poets imply that the conventional treatment of the poem is shabby and undeserved\\".Allot 1968 p. 17 Allott then cites Bridges and Eliot as views that he sympathizes with, and he believes that the poem \\"is neither unflawed nor the best of odes, but to me it illustrates better than any other Keats's possession of poetic power in conjunction with what was for him an unusual artistic detachment, besides being a remarkable poem in its own right. This may be another way of saying that it is the most architectural of the odes, as it is certainly the one that culminates most dramatically.\\" Walter Jackson Bate states that the poem has \\"always puzzled readers ... But finding the poem so elusive, we return to it only after we know the others far better. If we had hope to use them as keys, we discover they do not quite fit the lock. Meanwhile they have given us a standard hard to equal. Hence we either feel a disappointment about the 'Ode to Psyche' or else, remembering the care Keats supposedly gave it, we once more put the poem aside for future consideration.\\" However, he also states that \\"The modern, respectful attitude toward this ode is deserved. But the itch for novelty has encouraged a few critics to suggest that the poem, in some dark but fundamental way, has more to it as a whole than do the later odes.\\"Bate 1963 p. 491 To Harold Bloom, the last lines of Keats's ode \\"rivals any as an epitome of the myth-making faculty\\".Bloom 1964 p. 96 He elaborates further on this when he writes, \\"The poem Ode to Psyche is unique, and also central, for its art is a natural growth out of nature, based as it is upon a very particular act of consciousness, which Keats arrests in all its concreteness.\\"Bloom 1964 p. 97 NotesReferences * Allot, Kennet. \\"The Ode to Psyche\\" in Keats's Odes ed.

Royce stresses education as the best way to have successful encounters. He claims to have developed the techniques presented in the book through repeated experiences with law enforcement. Specifically treated is how to deal with law enforcement encounters when there are firearms involved. A new version was released in 2005 with forty added pages addressing new court cases, the Patriot Act, and the (forever) War on Terrorism, and much more. Bulletproof Privacy covers how to maintain privacy in what Royce refers to as a more dangerous time. He covers both legal methods and those of questionable (or jurisdiction-dependent) legality. This was published in 1997, and Royce wrote an updated version to deal with the Patriot Act, the Internet, and other current privacy issues. This new version, which came out in May 2009, was titled One Nation Under Surveillance. Video of BTP speaking at Libertarian conference Boston's Gun Bible is Royce's 848 page exhaustive firearms almanac and philosophical treatise on becoming and remaining an armed citizen.Doing Freedom 'zine: Boston's Gun Bible Review The last full revision was in 2002, but dozens of pages have been added or updated in the reprints of 2004, 2005, and 2006. Boston on Surviving Y2K is a survivalist book published in 1998 about how to prepare for the then-widely expected Y2K problem and also contains general information on emergency preparedness. Surviving Doomsday (A Practical Guide) is essentially a completed version of the same book that was published in September 1999 containing much more detail than was provided in the earlier book. Both books are widely suitable for general purpose disaster preparation and planning for individuals interested in surviving a wide range of disasters. Mol√¥n Lab√©! is Royce's only work of fiction. Published in 2004, it covers his view of what could happen as a result of a libertarian migration to specific counties within a specific state. It is partly a blueprint for his Free State Wyoming (FSW).Boston's Mol√¥n Lab√©! Hopes for Wyoming FreedomBoston Replies to Mol√¥n Lab√©! ReviewBook Review of Molon Labe In 2007, Royce told The Casper Star Tribune newspaper: \\"...FSWers aren't moving to Wyoming to change it, but to preserve and enhance its culture of freedom-mindedness. The state is already a 'good fit' for us, else we wouldn't be moving there.\\" Safari Dreams is Royce's entrance into big game hunting,N.Y. Times Bestselling Author R. A. Salvatore - Book Reviews for hunting both Dangerous Game (DG) and plains animals in Africa, based on his experiences from three hunting safari trips there. Published in January 2008, it covers the adventure and reasons for big game hunting in Africa, the selection of appropriate locations along with considerable guidance regarding safety considerations among the possible choices of locations, the choice of caliber and gun to take, and hints on tipping the PH (Professional Hunter), trackers, and staff. Taxidermy, obtaining the necessary licenses and permits, and customs clearance paperwork considerations are also covered. This book is written under his own name instead of under his pseudonym of Boston T. Party, and even contains many pictures of Royce taken while preparing to go and while on safari in Africa. All his titles except for \\"Good-Bye April 15th\\" are available as paperback and Kindle versions. \\"Good-Bye April 15th\\" is the only Royce book out-of-print. Cultural impact During the June 2010 U.S. Senate confirmation hearing of Elena Kagan's nomination to the Supreme Court, Royce was quoted by Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) in his opening remarks: \\"An email came across my inbox this morning that I thought of....'Liberty is not a cruise ship full of pampered passengers. Liberty is a man-of-war, and we are all crew.'....Of course we'll be talking about the different roles we each play on that crew'\\". The Washington Post archived it as video On Senator Cornyn's Facebook page, he accurately attributed the quote to Royce. The quote is from chapter 19 of Royce's \\"Boston's Gun Bible\\".

It is accredited by the Commission on Higher Education of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. RRC has an enrollment of approximately 80 students in rabbinic and other graduate programs.Fact Sheet for the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College: 2007-08 Academic Year,‚Äù RRC. A 2012 restructuring of the Reconstructionist movement's institutions left RRC as the primary organization of the movement, headed by Rabbi Deborah Waxman. This central organization changed its name to \\"Reconstructing Judaism\\" in January 2018. ‚Äî the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College remains part of this organization. She is believed to be the first female rabbi and first lesbian to lead a Jewish congregational union, and the first woman and first lesbian to lead a Jewish seminary. History=Founding to 1981= Reconstructionist Judaism, a liberal movement that views Judaism as the ‚Äúevolving religious civilization of the Jewish people‚Äù was established by Mordecai Kaplan in the 1930s as a school of thought. He had extensive influence on American Judaism, particularly on Conservative and Reform Judaism. However, his followers, including Ira Eisenstein (Kaplan‚Äôs son-in-law and leader of the Jewish Reconstructionist Foundation from 1959 onward) were frustrated by the lack of a continuing framework to promote their ideas in American Judaism. Eisenstein criticized dependence on ‚Äú‚ÄôReconstructionist rabbis‚Äô ‚Ä¶borrowed from the ranks of Reform and Conservativism‚Ä¶A movement must produce its own leaders.‚ÄùIra Eisenstein, ‚ÄúFrom School of Thought to Movement.‚Äù Reconstructionist, 41:1 (February, 1975) p.5 Kaplan himself was reluctant to establish a seminary which would mean creating a separate denomination alongside Reform, Conservative, and Orthodox Judaism. However, lay and rabbinic leaders of the small Federation of Reconstructionist Congregations and Havurot (FRCH, later re-named the Jewish Reconstructionist Federation) encouraged this step, and Kaplan eventually gave his blessing.M. Kaplan, ‚ÄúWhy A Reconstructionist Rabbinical College?‚Äù Reconstructionist 35:14 (2 Jan. 1970). At the FRCH conference in Montreal in June, 1967, the delegates overwhelmingly called for the establishment of a school for training rabbis. The college opened in 1968 based in two brownstone buildings at 2308 North Broad Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, near Temple University.Deborah Ann Musher, ‚ÄúReconstructionist Judaism in the Mind of Mordecai Kaplan: The Transformation from a Philosophy into a Religious Denomination,‚Äù American Jewish History, 86:4, December 1998, pp. 397-417. Also see Eric Caplan, From Ideology to Liturgy: Reconstructionist Worship and American Liberal Judaism (Hebrew Union College Press, New York and Cincinnati, 2002) pp.135 ff. From its founding, RRC had two unique features in its curriculum. First, based on the Reconstructionist concept of an ‚Äúevolving religious civilization‚Äù the five-year curriculum was centered on a historical period each year. These were biblical, rabbinic, medieval, modern (roughly to 1948), and contemporary periods. During each year, students would focus on the history, texts, and concepts of that period. With modifications, this developmental approach continues as a central feature of the RRC curriculum. RRC describes this goal:‚Äù‚Ä¶students enter into a dialogue with those in previous generations who addressed perennial human issues. In this way, RRC educates leaders who can articulate the voice of tradition as it speaks to today‚Äôs Jews.‚Äù RRC Catalogue, 2007-09, p. 4. The second curricular innovation, based on Kaplan‚Äôs concept that American Jews live in two civilizations (Jewish and American), had all rabbinical students enroll in a secular doctoral program, initially in religion at Temple University (a nearby state-related institution), later including other potential majors and universities. The goal was that students be aware of general trends in the study of religion and of other religious traditions. This ‚Äúdual program‚Äù proved difficult to complete, as most students were enrolled in two graduate programs while also working part-time. The initial doctoral requirement was eventually reduced to a secular master's degree. The Reconstructionist Rabbinical College also recognized that future rabbis needed preparation in addition to purely academic courses and text studies. From the early years of RRC there were courses in practical rabbinics, covering such issues as pastoral counseling and life cycle events. In more recent years these have expanded to a multi-tiered program of practical rabbinics that includes coursework, supervised field internships, group supervision, and a requirement to shadow religious leaders in the field. =1981-1993= Ziegelman Hall, the RRC's main building In 1981, Eisenstein, the founding president, retired, succeeded by Ira Silverman (1981‚Äì86). Under his leadership RRC moved from its urban setting in September 1982 to its current location, formerly the mansion of John Charles Martin, on Church Road in suburban Wyncote. By the early 1980s, curriculum changes at RRC included more Hebrew, classic texts, and electives, reducing the time available for secular graduate studies. In addition, many more entering students were preparing for their second career and had already completed a secular master's degree or the equivalent. The ‚Äúdual program‚Äù requirement for a secular graduate degree was dropped. However, a program of courses in religious studies including Christianity, Islam, and Eastern religions was instituted at RRC, some taught by adjunct faculty. At least two of these courses, including one in Christianity, are required for rabbinical students.RRC Catalogue, 2007-09, pp. 25, 35-36 A mekhinah (preparatory) year was added for many students who needed additional work in Hebrew and traditional Jewish sources and traditions. Arthur Green, a student of mysticism and a founder of the havurah movement, became president in 1986 after serving as dean from 1984. Faculty and student enrollment significantly increased, and the Israel study program expanded. To move beyond a strictly academic focus, RRC began offering programs in spiritual growth in 1987, under the leadership of dean Jacob Staub. Staub commented that the early focus of RRC, as with other seminaries, was not on questions of meaning but ‚ÄúWe were going for the original, objective, dispassionate description of phenomena.‚Äù But this expansion enabled the faculty to begin working with students as spiritual people and future leaders.RRC, 2007 annual report, ‚ÄúSpiritual Practice and Study Move to the Head of the Class: by Gerald S. Cohen, p.5. The first experimental edition of a new Reconstructionist Sabbath eve prayer book, the first in the Kol Haneshamah series, by the Reconstructionist Press in 1989 included contributions from a number of RRC faculty members. =Since 1993= David Teutsch became president in 1993. During his tenure the college strengthened its financial base and expanded its programs, publications, and facilities.David Teutsch, ‚ÄúRabbis for the 21st Century,‚Äù Sh‚Äôma, January 2003. The new series of Reconstructionist prayer books, Kol Haneshamah, was published under the leadership of Teutsch. Although RRC struggled to reach a $500,000 minimum endowment in its early years, by 1992 it reached $2.4 million, $14.8 million in 2004, and $19.7 million in 2006.‚ÄúInnovations in Spirit and Practice,‚Äù RRC Annual Report, 2007 p. 39 See also Caplan, From Ideology to Liturgy, p.135ff. Cantorial and master‚Äôs programs in Jewish studies were added. Three academic centers were established, The Center for Jewish Ethics (1994); Kolot: The Center for Jewish Women‚Äôs and Gender Studies (1996) and Hiddur: The Center for Aging and Judaism (2003). RRC had long been preparing students for a variety of rabbinic careers, including campus work, chaplaincy, and Jewish education as well as congregational leadership. Especially since the mid-1990s many students take at least one unit of Clinical Pastoral Education, a supervised program of training for clergy and other caregivers, often based in a hospital. During this time the college expanded its vision of modeling creation of a Jewish community for its future rabbis. From 1998, aided by a grant from the Nathan Cummings Foundation, a Jewish spiritual direction program founded by faculty member Jacob Staub grew. In 2007, on a completely voluntary basis, spiritual direction included 75% of the student body. The program includes individual meetings with a spiritual director, small groups, and in hevrutah (partners or dyads).RRC Catalogue, 2008-09, pp. 48-49. Faculty member Barbara Breitman says, ‚ÄúEvery spiritual tradition has within it the qualities of soul that people need to cultivate in their lives so that they can live according to a higher sense of purpose: generosity, patience, gratitude, truthfulness. Spiritual companioning needs to support people in cultivating those qualities.‚Äù RRC, 2007 annual report, ‚ÄúSpiritual Practice‚Äù p.8 The college marked a milestone in 2002 when Rabbi Dan Ehrenkrantz became the first graduate of RRC to become president. The RRC curriculum continues to be based on its civilizational approach. In addition, the college focuses on developing community and integrating spiritual growth with academic studies.\\"Ahavah Rabbah:To Learn And To Teach\\" inaugural address delivered by Rabbi Dan Ehrenkrantz on April 6, 2003 In 2011 Sandra Lawson became the first openly gay African-American and the first African-American admitted to RRC. In 2013 Rabbi Deborah Waxman was elected as the President of RRC. As the President, she is believed to be the first woman and first lesbian to lead a Jewish congregational union, and the first female rabbi and first lesbian to lead a Jewish seminary. In 2015 RRC voted to accept rabbinical students in interfaith relationships, making Reconstructionist Judaism the first type of Judaism to officially allow rabbis in relationships with non- Jewish partners. Academics RRC is a graduate institution. Rabbinical and other degree candidate students are required to have a bachelor's degree, and meet Hebrew and other requirements before enrolling. Graduates of the five- to six-year program are required to spend one of those years studying in Israel before graduating. Graduates receive the title of rabbi and a Master of Arts degree in Hebrew letters. In conjunction with the rabbinic program, RRC offers joint masters programs in Jewish education and in nonprofit management with Gratz College, a coordinated masters in nonprofit leadership with the University of Pennsylvania, and certificate programs in Congregational and Family Systems and in Marital and Family therapy with the Council for Relationships. From its early years, RRC included students in decision making. Representatives of students, alumni, faculty, and administration meet in a College Council that advises on current issues. In addition, all these groups have representatives on the RRC Board of Governors. Students are members of the Reconstructionist Student Association (RSA.) Campus The college's main building is and is red-brick, slate-roofed, and an example of Georgian architecture. It includes classrooms, a lounge, faculty and administrative offices, the Einstein Reconstructionist Archives; a beit midrash (study and discussion hall, also used for religious services); a media center, and conference rooms. The adjacent Goldyne Savad Library Center opened in 1999. The library houses approximately 50,000 books on Judaica, primarily in English, Hebrew, and Yiddish. Enrollment and alumni The first graduate of RRC, Michael Luckens, was ordained in 1973. From its second year, 1969, RRC students included women. Sandy Eisenberg Sasso was ordained in 1974, the second woman rabbi in the United States, and the first female Reconstructionist rabbi. Since 1984, RRC has admitted and allowed the ordination of openly gay, bisexual, and lesbian rabbis, the first major rabbinic seminary to do so.RRC press release, ‚ÄúReconstructionist Movement to Respond to Vote of Conservative Movement on Homosexuality,‚Äù Dec. 6, 2006. As of June 2018, RRC has graduated more than 420 rabbis. Most RRC graduates are members of the Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association. Approximately half the graduates serve congregations (Reconstructionist, those affiliated with other movements, or unaffiliated.) Others serve in academia, in Hillel and campus positions, as civilian and military chaplains, educators, in Jewish agencies, or are employed by the Reconstructionist movement. About one-fifth work in other areas, including as authors, editors, researchers, spiritual counselors, independent rabbis, or are retired. RRC graduates serve Jewish communities in the US, Canada, Australia, France, and Israel. College centers The College sponsored three program centers, of which The Center for Jewish Ethics is still in operation: =The Center for Jewish Ethics= The Center for Jewish Ethics, founded in 1994, helps address the ethical challenges of contemporary life, through the training of future rabbis, hosting of conferences, and publication of ethics-related material. =Kolot, The Center for Jewish Women's and Gender Studies= Created in 1996, this center worked in both gender and women's studies. Kolot sponsored a variety of publications and seminars. It hosted a Web site for creative Jewish liturgy for holidays and life cycle events. In 2004, Kolot spun off a program for Jewish teenage girls, \\"Rosh Hodesh: It's a Girl Thing\\", to \\"Moving Traditions\\", a program that promotes a more inclusive and expansive view of gender. Ritualwell is another initiative of Kolot still in operation. The center closed in the mid-2000s. = Hiddur, The Center for Aging and Judaism = Created in 2003, and closed in 2011, Hiddur's efforts focused on developing spiritual resources and scholarship around aging Jews.

It began in 1904 at a time when Picasso settled in Montmartre at the Bateau-Lavoir among bohemian poets and writers. Following Picasso's Blue Period, depicting themes of poverty, loneliness, and despair in somber tones of daunting blues, Picasso's Rose Period represents more pleasant themes of clowns, harlequins, and carnival performers, depicted in cheerful vivid hues of red, orange, pink and earth tones. Based largely on intuition rather than direct observation, Picasso's Rose Period marks the beginning of the artists' stylistic experiments with primitivism; influenced by pre-Roman Iberian sculpture, Oceanic and African art. This led to Picasso's African Period in 1907, culminating in the Proto-Cubist Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, regarded as a masterpiece.Voorhies, James. Pablo Picasso (1881‚Äì1973), Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 2000Wattenmaker, Richard J.; Distel, Anne, et al.,1993, p. 194Richardson John.

Overview Boy Leading a Horse, 1905‚Äì06, oil on canvas, 220.6 cm √ó 131.2 cm (86.85 in √ó 51.65 in), Museum of Modern Art, New York The Rose Period lasted from 1904 to 1906. Picasso was happy in his relationship with Fernande Olivier whom he had met in 1904 and this has been suggested as one of the possible reasons he changed his style of painting. Harlequins, circus performers and clowns appear frequently in the Rose Period and populated Picasso's paintings at various stages throughout the rest of his long career. The harlequin, a comedic character usually depicted in checkered patterned clothing, became a personal symbol for Picasso. At the time Picasso lived at the Le Bateau-Lavoir (center) in Montmartre, Paris. The Rose Period has been considered French influenced, while the Blue Period more Spanish influenced, although both styles emerged while Picasso was living in Paris. Picasso's Blue Period began in late 1901, following the death of his friend Carlos Casagemas and the onset of a bout of major depression. It lasted until 1904, when Picasso's psychological condition improved. The Rose Period is named after Picasso's heavy use of pink tones in his works from this period, from the French word for pink, which is rose. Picasso's third highest selling painting, Gar√ßon √† la pipe (Boy with a pipe) was painted during the Rose Period.

The otaku ultimately began dating one of the women. The event, and the man's subsequent dates with the woman, who became known as , were chronicled on the Japanese mega-BBS 2channel. This led to the compilation of the relevant threads in a book, followed by several manga versions, a movie, a theatrical play later released as a DVD, and finally a TV series. Densha Otoko is a popular example of the \\"nice guy\\" class of Japanese geeks who wish to lead normal lives, but are too shy to find a girlfriend, or speak openly only online. The television series uses a large number of computer-bound extras.  Story  On March 14, 2004, at 9:55 p.m., an anonymous user posted in a 2channel thread for single men to talk about their woes. According to his account, he had been sitting next to a young woman on the train when a drunken man entered the car and began to badger a particular woman. The poster took the risk of telling the man to stop bothering the passengers, who were all women. The two struggled for a short time while the other passengers used this distraction to summon the conductor, who took control of the situation. Never having done such a thing in his life, the poster was amazed to find the woman thanking him deeply for saving her from harassment. The young woman requested his address, telling him that she wanted to express her appreciation for his act, before they parted ways. The poster, upon returning home, shared his experience with other posters in the thread and was eventually nicknamed \\"Densha Otoko\\" (Train Man). A few days later, Train Man received a package from the woman: an expensive set of cups and saucers made by Herm√®s, a French luxury goods company. Flabbergasted, the man turned to the 2channelers for advice; he was soon convinced that the tea set was too expensive to be a mere thank-you gift. Following the advice and suggestions of the other posters, Train Man eventually contacted the woman. The man who wrote admitted things about himself, such as the fact that his number of years without girlfriends equaled his age, that he was an Akihabara nerd and an otaku, and that he had never been on a date. Because of this last fact, he consistently posted updates on his situation, asking for advice on everything from restaurant choices to what clothing to wear. After an enjoyable first date, they began meeting regularly. Following the 2channelers' collective advice, he got a haircut, updated his wardrobe, and began to emerge from his shell. After several dates, his demeanor had changed for the better and this culminated a few months later in his confessing his love for her. She reciprocated, and when the 2channelers were informed, there was a mass celebration; posts began flowing in congratulating the new couple, and extravagant Shift JIS art pictures were posted. Train Man's posts continued for a while longer, but on May 17, there were posts about the couple being on the verge of having sex, and several forum members made inappropriate comments on the subject. Later that night, Train Man left the boards for good. = Authenticity = While many attest to the truth of the story‚Äîincluding the producers of the television series, who supposedly contacted the real Train Man‚Äîit has not been proven that the story was completely authentic. The true identity of \\"Train Man\\" is never revealed and the book is based on an edited collection of posts on the 2channel bulletin board. The original conversation lasted fifty-seven days and contained 29,862 posts, whereas the book contains 1,919 posts, as collected on a fan website. A list of inconsistencies in the story has been collated, including Train Man being too young to have a university degree and be in the workforce for three years. Production The initial setting of the film is in Akihabara, Tokyo. Mark Schilling of The Japan Times comments that \\"since Fuji TV intends Densha Otoko for prime-time broadcast, Hermess (Nakatani) can only suggest a big sisterly friendliness and affection, meaning that the sexual chemistry between her and Train Man (Yamada) is zero\\". Pop Culture Shock's Erin Finnegan reported, \\"when asked if the original novel would ever be imported, manga industry reps at New York Comic Con lamented that 2chan's version of l33t is nearly impossible to translate.\\" The fansite compiling the posts which became the book has been translated into other languages by fans of the story, including into English in 2006. President and CEO for Viz Pictures, Seiji Horibuchi, comments that the film Train Man: Densha Otoko \\"will make people think fondly about their own first experiences with love and the thrill and rush it caused. Perhaps it will even inspire a few to take a chance on someone they like!\\" Media=Book= Densha Otoko originated from a fifty-seven-day online conversation, from March 14 to May 16, that included a total of 29,862 posts on 2channel was edited into a six- chapter story, each called \\"Missions\\" of 1,919 posts and made available on the Matome site. According to by Kenji And≈ç, only 6.4% of the whole conversation thread was not published in the Densha Otoko book. The author of the book used the name . This name is a pun on the Japanese term \\"Naka no hitori\\", referring to all the people who are part of message boards on the Internet. There isn't a specific person that is credited as the author; rather, it is close to a shared pseudonym. Shinchosha released the novel on October 22, 2004. Del Rey Books released the novel, renamed as Train Man, on April 24, 2007. =Drama= The drama's 11 episodes were aired on Fuji TV from July 7 to September 22, 2005 (with a special episode on October 6, 2005).

Reception Densha Otoko novel sold 260,000 copies in just three weeks and 500,000 copies in two months. Following its popularity, \\"Chikan Otoko\\" was produced, the story of a man who is accused of being a groper on public transport, and Napoleon Dynamite was retitled Basu Otoko (\\"Bus Man\\") for its Japanese release. The Japan Times' Janet Ashby commented that the book felt like an \\"otaku wish-fulfillment fantasy: Someday I will magically meet Miss Right, rescue her like a knight on a white horse, be transformed into Mr. Right, and we will live happily ever after. The reaction of Miss Hermes when Trainman belatedly shows her the log of his postings about their private affairs was particularly unbelievable to me. Far from being hurt or angry, she is impressed by what good friends he has!\\" Mania.com's Matthew Alexander commends Densha Otoko: The Story of a Train Man Who Fell in Love With A Girl for being realistic, saying, \\"right after [Train's] session with a hair stylist, his hair is standing up in the right spots and looks good. Then, just like in real life, a couple of days afterwards his hair is back to looking like a shorter version of his hairstyle before it got cut. A very small part of the story I know, but I really appreciated the effort at displaying realism.\\" Coolstreak Comics' Leroy Douresseaux comments on Densha Otoko: The Story of a Train Man Who Fell in Love With A Girl, saying, \\"Watanabe understands the visual metaphor of the comics medium, which allows him to deliver his story with a force that captures the quiet awkwardness of two shy people\\". IGN's A.E. Sparrow comments on the artwork of Densha Otoko: Train Man saying, \\"Hidenori Hara brings an old school style to his illustration, and there are moments where the complex panel layouts (particularly when several online people are offering advice at once) recall some of Will Eisner's best work.\\" A later review by Sparrow comments that Hidenori Hara's \\"work seems the most cartoonish of the bunch, with some of the characters looking almost like afterthoughts, but it's that scribbling style that really sets this version of the story apart.\\" He also comments on Hermess looking \\"like a slightly more pixie-ish version of Lisa Hayes from Robotech\\". Anime News Network's Carlo Santos' review of Train Man: A Sh≈çjo Manga commends it for its \\"unique character viewpoint and a sweet, lighthearted mood\\". However, he criticises it for \\"skimping on plot and character development; sometimes awkward with Internet humor.\\" See also * My Sassy Girl * Dokuo ReferencesExternal links * ÈõªËªäÁî∑ (The original trainman posts) * ÈõªËªäÁî∑@ÂÖ®ÈÅéÂéª„É≠„Ç∞ (Past posts) * * Densha Otoko stage play home page * FLAREgamer's Densha Otoko Preview and Comparisons * Film locations in Densha Otoko Category:2channel Category:CMX titles Category:Del Rey Manga Category:Internet memes Category:2004 Japanese novels Category:2005 manga Category:Manga series Category:Otaku Category:Viz Media manga Category:Trains in fiction Category:Shogakukan manga Category:Kodansha manga Category:Akita Shoten manga Category:One-shot manga Category:Novels about the Internet Category:Shinchosha books ","title":"Densha Otoko"},{"id":"2291631","text":"Huo Guang at the center of an altar in Shanghai City God Temple Huo Guang (; died 68 BC), courtesy name Zimeng (Â≠êÂ≠ü), was a Western Han politician who was a rare example in Chinese history of a powerful official who deposed an emperor for the good of the state rather than to usurp the throne. He was the half- brother of renowned Han general Huo Qubing, and one of the most powerful consort kin in Chinese imperial history. Service under Emperor Wu Huo Guang was born to Huo Zhongru and he had a half-brother named Huo Qubing, a renowned general. His step-aunt was Empress Wei Zifu, the second Empress of Emperor Wu of Han. Huo's early career in Han government was not well documented, but it is known that as of 88 BC‚Äînear the end of Emperor Wu's reign, he was already a high-ranked official with dual titles of Fengche Duwei (Â•âËªäÈÉΩÂ∞â) and Guanglu Dafu (ÂÖâÁ•øÂ§ßÂ§´). When Emperor Wu, near the end of his life, chose his youngest son Liu Fuling (later Emperor Zhao) as heir, he commissioned Huo, ethnically-Xiongnu official Jin Midi, and imperial guard commander Shangguan Jie (‰∏äÂÆòÊ°Ä) as coregents, but with Huo effectively in command of the government, with the titles of dasima (Â§ßÂè∏È¶¨) and dajiangjun (Â§ßÂ∞áËªç). When Emperor Wu died in 87 BC, Emperor Zhao, then eight years old, was left in the tutelage of Huo, Jin, and Shangguan. Emperor Wu's will created the three of them as marquesses, but all three declined. Service under Emperor Zhao and Control of power as regent  As Emperor Zhao was the youngest son of Emperor Wu, this created conflict and ill will with his older brothers, and in his reign there were multiple conspiracies. In 86 BC, a conspiracy involving Liu Dan (ÂäâÊó¶), Prince of Yan, and an elder son of Emperor Wu, was discovered, but the prince was not punished, presumably under Huo's decision, even though the other conspirators were executed. In 85 BC, Huo was created the Marquess of Bolu (ÂçöÈôÜ‰æØ). In the same year, Jin, a moderating influence in the co- regency, died. After Jin's death, Shangguan became increasingly jealous of Huo's powers, even though the two had been great friends, and Huo had given his daughter in marriage to Shangguan's son Shangguan An (‰∏äÂÆòÂÆâ). In 84 BC, as a ploy to further strengthen his powers, Shangguan Jie gave his granddaughter (also Huo's granddaughter), then age five, in marriage to the emperor, then age 11, and she was made empress in 83 BC. In 80 BC, the growing conflict between Huo and Shangguan came to a head. Shangguan formed a conspiracy with Liu Dan, the Prince of Yan, the Princess Eyi (ÈÑÇÈÇëÂÖ¨‰∏ª) (who, as the emperor's sister, had served as his guardian), and another important official Sang Hongyang (Ê°ëÂºòÁæä) to make false allegations of treason against Huo. However, Emperor Zhao, who trusted Huo, did not act on the allegations. The conspirators then planned a coup d'etat, but were discovered. Most of the conspirators, including Shangguan, were executed, and Liu Dan and the Princess of Eyi were forced to commit suicide. The Prince He Incident and the installation of Emperor Xuan In 74 BC, Emperor Zhao died at age 21 without issue. Even though Emperor Zhao had living older brothers, Huo considered them incompetent and unfit for the throne. After some investigation, he settled on making Liu He, Emperor Zhao's nephew and the Prince of Changyi the new emperor. Once the Prince of Changyi was installed as the emperor, however, he began to spend incessantly and otherwise act inappropriately during the period of mourning for Emperor Zhao. In response, Huo decided to depose the new emperor, an unprecedented action in Chinese history. Under an edict issued by Empress Dowager Shangguan (Huo's granddaughter), Prince He was deposed after just 28 days as emperor and exiled to his old principality of Changyi, but without a princely title. There was no imperial heir who met Huo's standard of a diligent and skilled emperor. At the suggestion of another senior official Bing Ji (‰∏ôÂêâ), Huo made a great-grandson of Emperor Wu, Liu Bingyi (later Liu Xun ÂäâË©¢) emperor. (Liu Bingyi's grandfather Liu Ju had been Emperor Wu's crown prince by Empress Wei but subsequently fell out of favour and was killed, with his issue being removed from the imperial household). Service under Emperor Xuan In 73 BC, Huo offered to return all authority to Emperor Xuan, but the emperor declined and reaffirmed that all important matters were to be presented to Huo before Huo would present them to the emperor. The emperor also made Huo's son Huo Yu (ÈúçÁ¶π) and his grandnephews Huo Yun (ÈúçÈõ≤) and Huo Shan (ÈúçÂ±±) (Huo Qubing's grandsons) key officials in his administration. Huo Guang's sons-in-law Fan Mingyou (ËåÉÊòéÂèã) and Deng Guanghan (ÈÑßÂª£Êº¢) were made high military commanders. During the next few years, Huo and the emperor effectively shared imperial powers. In 71 BC, Huo Guang's wife, Xian (È°Ø), in order to make her daughter Huo Chengjun (ÈúçÊàêÂêõ) empress, poisoned Emperor Xuan's wife Empress Xu Pingjun by bribing her doctor. In 70 BC, Huo Chengjun was created empress. Despite Emperor Xuan's outward respect towards Huo Guang, it was recorded that he feared Huo, and regarded him as \\"a thorn in (his) back\\" (ËäíÂà∫Âú®ËÉå, \\"mang ci zai bei\\"). This, combined with Huo Guang's unwillingness to rein in his clansmen, would prove disastrous to the Huo clan. Death and subsequent destruction of the Huo clan The tomb of Huo Guang in Xi'an, Shaanxi In 68 BC, Huo Guang became ill and died. Emperor Xuan and Empress Dowager Shangguan made the nearly-unprecedented act of personally attending Huo's wake and built an impressive mausoleum for Huo. After Huo's death, his sons, sons-in-law, and grandnephews remained in important posts and were made marquesses. His wife, after a period of mourning, formed a passionate relationship with Huo Guang's slave master, Feng Zidu, himself a former lover of Huo Guang.Hinsch, Bret. (1990). Passions of the Cut Sleeve. University of California Press. pp. 49- 50 The Huo family lived luxurious lives similar to the imperial household. Emperor Xuan, unhappy about the Huos' perceived arrogance, began to gradually strip their actual powers while letting them keep their formal titles. In 67 BC, Emperor Xuan made his son Liu Shi (ÂäâÂ•≠, later Emperor Yuan), by the deceased Empress Xu, crown prince, an act that greatly angered Lady Xian, who instructed her daughter to murder the crown prince. Allegedly, Empress Huo did make multiple attempts to do so, but failed each time. Around this time, the emperor also heard rumours that the Huos had murdered Empress Xu, which led him to further strip the Huos of actual power. In 66 BC, Lady Xian revealed to her son and grandnephews that she had, indeed, murdered Empress Xu. In fear of what the emperor might do if he had actual proof, Lady Xian, her son, her grandnephews, and her sons-in-law formed a conspiracy to depose the emperor. The conspiracy was discovered, and the entire Huo clan was executed by Emperor Xuan. This act later drew heavy criticism from historians, such as Sima Guang in his Zizhi Tongjian, for its ungratefulness to Huo Guang. Empress Huo was deposed. Twelve years later she was exiled and, in response, she committed suicide. Despite the destruction of the Huo clan, Emperor Xuan continued to honour Huo Guang posthumously. In 51 BC, when he painted the portrait of 11 great statesmen of his administration in the great hall of his palace, Huo, alone among the 11, was referred to by title and family name only, which was considered an even greater honour than the honour given to the other ten. Impact on Chinese history Huo was treated somewhat paradoxically by posterity. On one hand, he was greatly admired for his skilful administration of the empire and his selflessness in putting himself in great danger in deposing an unfit emperor. On the other hand, he was also criticized for his dictatorial governing style, alleged nepotism and failure to rein in the behaviour of his clansmen, traits that some historians claim eventually led to his clan's destruction after his death. Many later conspirators in Chinese history would often claim that they were acting in the empire's best interest, like Huo, even though few actually did. Conversely, when emperors wanted to accuse (and execute) officials of treason, they often euphemistically refer to them as \\"wanting to act like Huo Guang.\\" Effectively, Huo set a standard of decisiveness and strength that was rarely matched and even more rarely used for the benefit of the state.

Life Ari was born in Munich, Germany. Both her parents were involved in the music industry: Her father, Frank Forster, was a German schlager singer who had some success in the 50s and 60s while her mother Nora was a friend of Jimi Hendrix and dated Chris Spedding for three years. Ari's maternal grandfather was the wealthy German newspaper proprietor Franz Karl Maier, owner of Der Tagesspiegel. Her godfathers were Austrian singer/composer Udo J√ºrgens and Jon Anderson, the singer of the group Yes. Nora later married the Sex Pistols' lead singer, John Lydon, in 1979. Their home was known to be something of a punk domain, where Nora would take in poor musicians. The constant presence of punk music led to Ari experimenting with it herself, learning to play the guitar from The Clash's Joe Strummer. In 1976, at the age of 14, Ari formed The Slits with drummer Palmolive. Within a short time, guitarist Viv Albertine joined the group and found herself deeply impressed by the young singer. \\"English was her second language,\\" Albertine noted in an interview. \\"It was not easy for her and she had to fight to be taken seriously.\\" She succeeded: \\"Ari was the most dynamic woman I have ever known,\\" said Albertine. \\"The way she carried herself was a revolution.\\" By the late 1970s, The Slits were touring as the opening act for The Clash. Ari Up's love of reggae led The Slits into a \\"jungly\\" dub style. She was the most flamboyant member of the group, becoming known for her wild hair and odd stage outfits. She can be seen briefly in The Clash film Rude Boy, associating with the band backstage. Her 1977 performances with The Slits are featured in The Punk Rock Movie, a documentary release of various punk group club performances, principally at The Roxy. After The Slits disbanded in 1981, Ari moved with her husband and twin sons, Pablo and Pedro, fathered by her boyfriend, Glenmore \\"Junior\\" Williams, to jungle regions of Indonesia and Belize and lived among indigenous people in those areas. Later, they moved to Jamaica, eventually settling in Kingston. She continued to make music, first with the New Age Steppers, then as a solo artist, using the stage names Baby Ari, Madussa, and Ari Up. Her son Wilton was born in 1994, tragically, the boy's father had been shot dead by the time he was born. In 2000, Lydon and Nora became legal guardians of Ari's twin boys; as Lydon explained \\"[Ari] let them run free. They couldn‚Äôt read, write or form proper sentences. One day Ari said she couldn‚Äôt cope with them any more. I suggested they came to us because I wasn‚Äôt having them abandoned. They gave us hell, but I loved having kids around.\\" Ari's first full-length solo album, Dread More Dan Dead, was released in 2005. Ari Up in 2008. Ari Up appeared on Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry's Repentance (2008), and performed a duet on a cover version of Mike Hugg's song \\"Mister, You're a Better Man Than I\\" on Mark Stewart's, Edit (2008). In 2008, Ari was diagnosed with breast cancer. However she refused the physician-recommended chemotherapy. Lydon later commented, \\"who refuses chemo because they don‚Äôt want their Rasta locks cut off? Ariane was just‚Ä¶not sensible. She thought she could cure herself with witch doctors. We spent hundreds of thousands trying to save her, but it was too late.\\" Despite the diagnosis, she performed in July, 2009, with Perry and Austrian dub band Dubblestandart in Brooklyn, New York, just prior to the Central Park SummerStage festival. One of Ari's last recordings took place in May 2010, in New York with Lee Scratch Perry. The sessions were recorded by the Subatomic Sound System and released in August 2010 on 7\\" vinyl, titled \\"Hello, Hell is Very Low\\" b/w \\"Bed Athletes.\\" The Slits' final work, the video for the song \\"Lazy Slam\\" from Trapped Animal, was released posthumously in accordance with Ari's wishes. On 20 October 2010, Ari died in Los Angeles, aged 48. Her death was initially announced on Lydon's homepage. At this time, Lydon and Nora also became guardians of Ari's third child, Wilton. A tribute Punky Reggae Birthday Party was held in at the Music Hall of Williamsburg by Dunia Best, Aram Sinnreich and Vivien Goldman on Brooklyn on 16 January 2011. Neneh Cherry, Tessa Pollitt, Hollie Cook and other former members of The Slits performed, along with members of the True Warriors, New Age Steppers, and other friends and associates.

Nearly 11 million rail passengers use the station every year,Based on combined ridership of Via Rail, Amtrak, and AMT (see infobox on top of article). making it the second-busiest train station in Canada. The main concourse occupies almost the entire block bounded by De la Gaucheti√®re Street, Robert-Bourassa Boulevard, Ren√© L√©vesque Boulevard and Mansfield Street in Downtown Montreal. Its street address and principal vehicular access are on de La Gaucheti√®re; pedestrian access is assured by numerous links through neighboring buildings. The station is adorned with art deco bas-relief friezes on its interior and exterior. The station building and associated properties are owned by Cominar REIT as of January 2012. Homburg Invest Inc. (renamed Canmarc in September 2011) was the previous owner, since November 30, 2007. Prior to that, from the station's inception in 1943, it had been owned by Canadian National Railway (CN). Central Station is at the centre of the Quebec City‚ÄìWindsor Corridor, the busiest inter-city rail service area in the nation (marketed as the Corridor), which extends from Windsor and Sarnia in the west, through Toronto, Ottawa, and Montreal, to Quebec City in the east. Inter-city trains at Central Station are operated by Via Rail and Amtrak, while commuter rail services are operated by R√©seau de transport m√©tropolitain (RTM). The station is also slated to become a hub for the R√©seau express m√©tropolitain, currently under construction. The station is also connected to the Montreal Metro subway system. Central Station is the second-busiest Via Rail station in Canada, after Toronto Union Station. Its Via station code is MTRL; its Amtrak code is MTR, and its IATA code is YMY. History Central Station opened in 1943, after several years of construction. It stands on the site originally occupied by the terminus of the Canadian Northern Railway's Tunnel Terminal, which had originally opened in 1918. =Canadian National Railways= Dorchester Street in 1930. Following the bankruptcy of the Grand Trunk Railway, the Government of the Dominion of Canada decided to consolidate the Grand Trunk Railway with the various Canadian Government Railways to form the Canadian National Railway (CNR). The merger left CNR with a somewhat viable patchwork of different networks. For much of the first half of the 20th century, CNR found itself in a highly uncomfortable position in Montreal due to the scattering of its terminals. Bonaventure Station was used for routes heading west and south east, the Tunnel Terminal served routes heading north, Moreau Street Station served eastbound routes, and the McGill Street Terminal served the interurban streetcars of the Montreal and Southern Counties Railway. Making matters worse, the various stations were not connected to one another except via long detours. To transfer a train from Bonaventure Station to Tunnel Station it would need to travel to Hawkesbury, Ontario, and to travel from Tunnel Station to Moreau Station it needed to take a detour via Rawdon in the Laurentians. =Consolidation and construction= Red shows proposed line to facilitate access to Central Station. The solution chosen was to take advantage of the Mount Royal Tunnel to bring trains from the north and east through the tunnel to a large electrified central station. Trains from the south and west gained access by a new elevated viaduct. Interurban electric trains, however, remained at McGill Street Terminal until the service was abandoned in 1956. The new station plan allowed for the development of air-rights, similar to New York City's two major stations, Grand Central Terminal and Penn Station. The new Central Station would be situated in the block bounded by De la Gaucheti√®re Street to the south, Mansfield Street to the west, Cathcart Street to the north and University Street to the east. Central Station was designed by John Schofield, architect-in-chief of CNR. Construction started in 1926, but was halted in 1930 as a result of the Great Depression. Construction resumed in 1939, the economy having improved. The new station finally opened on July 14, 1943, as the first of a series of large-scale urban redevelopment projects undertaken by CNR and the federal government in Downtown Montreal. But the Central Station that came out was a more modest structure with 20 tracks, 16 of which had platforms. =Opening= Postcard of Central Station. The postcard is undated, but the slogan on the back promoting the sale of war bonds suggests that the card was printed around the time of the station's opening in 1943. The opening of a 'central' station was part of a consolidation project undertaken by CNR since 1929 with the enactment of the Canadian National Montreal Terminals Act, 1929 by Parliament; this saw the closure of former temporary stations operated by CNR predecessors Grand Trunk (Bonaventure Station) and Canadian Northern. =Consolidation of CN and CP intercity trains= Central Station was an important passenger station for CN trains from 1943 until the creation of Via Rail in 1978. Following Via's full absorption of CP's passenger trains in 1978, intercity rail traffic from Windsor Station was slowly redirected to Central Station. The final Via trains switched from Windsor Station to Central Station were the Quebec City trains that operated by way of Trois-Rivi√®res (April 29, 1984). Amtrak's Adirondack was switched to Central Station on January 12, 1986. =Modifications to the station= On June 2, 1995, the last commuter train hauled by venerable CN Z-1-a electric Bo-Bo #6710 has arrived in Central Station and pauses with the train crew. This locomotive was the same that had inaugurated the Mount Royal Tunnel, 77 years earlier. At Central Station's opening, tracks (7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12) of the Tunnel Station were used only by trains heading north through the tunnel, and they did not continue south of the station. These tracks were finally connected to the south when the old Tunnel Station was demolished as well as the warehouse located south of De la Gaucheti√®re Street and east of Inspector Street (now Mansfield Street). This also allowed for the construction of the new headquarters of CNR as well as Place Bonaventure. This division is once again in effect following the rebuilding of the Deux- Montagnes line. These tracks are now part of the Two Mountains Subdivision, extending south for a distance of about 1600 metres. Under catenary wires, they serve as parking for trains on the Deux-Montagnes line during the day. Since the reopening of the Mont-Saint-Hilaire line, they are also used to park trains from this line. Tracks 6‚Äì16 lead to the tunnel to the north, and lanes 4, 5 and tracks 16 to 23 are in a cul-de-sac to the north (track 16 is provided with a switch just north of the stairs). Tracks 13 to 15 are never used in the northbound direction because of the lack of catenary wires. One platform (23) is inaccessible to the main concourse, and serves instead as parking for the company cars belonging to upper-level management. Upon entry into service of the UAC TurboTrain, three tracks (4, 5, 6) were arranged on the west side of the station for a servicing and maintenance facility located there. The workshop, called \\"Turbo Bay\\", is still used to maintain light commuter trains as well as the private cars belonging to CN's senior management who use the station. The tracks in the workshop are protected by derails. Around 1980, the catenary wire was removed from tracks 13, 14, 15 and 16, to allow dome train cars to enter the station. In 1994‚Äì1995, the complete reconstruction of the commuter rail Deux-Montagnes Line resulted in tracks 7‚Äì12 being re-electrified at 25 kV AC. The original 3000-volt DC catenary was removed from the other tracks. The platforms of tracks 7 and 8 are now inaccessible from the station, the entrance having been sealed to allow for the development of commercial space, and the tracks now used as parking for trains waiting to be repaired in the \\"Turbo Bay\\". =Bombing= On September 3, 1984, a pipe bomb exploded inside a Central Station locker, killing 3 people and injuring 30 more. The bomb was alleged to have been set by retired American armed forces officer Thomas Bernard Brigham, who claimed to have been protesting Pope John Paul II's visit to Canada. Architecture With the design being overseen by CNR's architect-in-chief John Schofield (1883‚Äì1971), the architecture of Central Station is modern; it is a mixture of Art Deco and the international style. Its large concourse, designed by John Campbell Merrett (1909‚Äì1998), is illuminated by large windows. Originally, the concourse was cluttered by various ticket counters and kiosks, but, over time, they were pushed to the extremities of the room, which left much more space for the passing crowds. The 14 underground tracks are accessible by seven stairwells, five of which are equipped with escalators. The east and west interior walls of the station feature two large bas-reliefs depicting Canadian life, arts and industry, designed by Charles Comfort and executed by Sebastiano Aiello.\\"Canadian National Railway Grand Central Station\\", Canada's Historic Places Included in the bas relief are a few of the lyrics of O Canada, which still was not the national anthem when the station was built. The lyrics are in French on the east side of the station and in English on the west side. Canadian artist Fritz Brandtner created the three large chiselled stone reliefs depicting Mercury, Apollo and Poseidon on the station's north exterior wall. The representations of Mercury and Poseidon measure approximately 2,5m by 4,5m. Apollo is larger but visual access is very limited. These were obscured by the 1958 construction of the neighbouring Queen Elizabeth Hotel. It is disputed whether Comfort or Brandtner created the thematic stone medallions depicting water, land and air transportation on the station's west, south and east exterior walls. Stylistically, however, the bas-relief medallions bear a strong resemblance to the frieze by Charles Comfort created for the Toronto Stock Exchange building in 1937. Railway operations A sample of the bas-relief artwork that adorns the concourse's walls. Because of its underground urban location, the railway station quickly imposed operational constraints on CNR. To avoid smoke in the vicinity of the station, the first trains were powered by electric locomotives. The change of traction took place at Bridge Street, south for trains serving the south-east, at Turcot Yards, west for trains serving the west, Val Royal, north for trains running northwest of the junction and north for trains serving the northeast. A fleet of 14 electric locomotives were used for this work. An elaborate system of signals allowed staff to track the status of the various trains. At the station, as soon as the train was ready to receive passengers, the conductor inserted the key switch in a special switch indicating to staff at the station (ticket checkers) that the train was ready. The movement director at Wellington was also advised via a series of lights that the train was receiving passengers, which then allowed him to establish the route out of the station. Access to the platforms is controlled by ticket examiners who verify each passenger's ticket. This configuration limits access uniquely to passengers. At the time of departure, after all passengers had descended, the ticket checker would press a button that notified the conductor, through a green light on the platform, that the train could leave. The movement director in Wellington was also advised of the departure by a special light. The final decision of departure was the responsibility of the conductor, until conductors were replaced by a second engineer in the 1990s. Urban development The parking garage bordering de La Gaucheti√®re Street. Over the years, the empty space around Central Station has gradually developed to the point where the station building itself is hardly visible from the outside. In 1948, ICAO built its headquarters over the northeast portion of the station along University Street south of Dorchester Street. Then in 1959, the Queen Elizabeth Hotel was built on the western portion, on the corner of Dorchester and Mansfield, which was the first of many major redevelopments in the area. In 1960, the former Tunnel Station building was demolished to allow for the construction of the new head-office of CNR, and soon after, a large parking garage was built over the southern part of the station. The Terminal Tower of 1966 completely hid the station from Dorchester Boulevard. Belmont Street, east of the station was extended over the station itself to Mansfield Street. On Belmont is the only visible portion of the exterior of the station, the rest having been attached to the various buildings built over the years. The north side of Dorchester (now Ren√© L√©vesque Boulevard) then saw the construction of the complex of Place Ville-Marie, which now includes four skyscrapers whose highest was 45 floors and an underground shopping mall, which was the beginning of the Underground City. In the mid 1960s, Place Bonaventure was built over the tracks, south of de La Gaucheti√®re Street. In 1966, Central Station and Place Bonaventure were connected underground by the new Bonaventure Metro station, named in honour of the demolished Bonaventure railway station. All of these buildings underwent major renovations over the next 30 years. Connecting facilities Les Halles de la gare shopping and restaurant complex. Central Station is located adjacent to CN Headquarters and is an important link in the underground city, with tunnels to Place Ville- Marie, Place Bonaventure, the Queen Elizabeth Hotel, 1000 de La Gaucheti√®re and the Bonaventure Metro station. It also contains two parking facilities, one of which is a multi-level facility that is located above the station. =Les Halles de la Gare= Central Station has gradually grown to include Les Halles de la Gare, a shopping and restaurant complex. Real estate pressures have meant that the shopping area would be expanded several times. While the old ICAO building was undergoing renovations in 1981, (after the relocation of ICAO to Sherbrooke Street), a railway-themed shopping area expanded on the north side of the station. This section was completely destroyed in 1995 during the restoration of the Deux-Montagnes Line, and was replaced by the present Les Halles de la Gare complex. U.S. preclearance In May 2012, U.S. Senators Charles Schumer, Kirsten Gillibrand, Patrick Leahy, and Bernie Sanders sent a letter to President Barack Obama urging him to fastrack the approval of a U.S. Customs preclearance facility at the station that will benefit U.S. bound travelers on the Adirondack from having to stop at the railway station located in Rouses Point, New York for immigration and customs checks whenever they cross the Canada‚ÄìUS border. Under the arrangement, the stop in Saint-Lambert would be removed. The agreement will also allow another Amtrak line, the Vermonter, to be extended from its current terminus at St. Albans to Montreal, though this agreement must first be approved by United States Congress and the Parliament of Canada. This would enable direct travel by train from Montreal to Washington, D.C.'s Union Station via Massachusetts and New York City, as well as the potential development of direct service to Boston. On March 16, 2015, the United States and Canada signed an agreement that would allow for such a facility. Enabling legislation was enacted by the United States on December 16, 2016 as the Promoting Travel, Commerce, and National Security Act of 2016.

The crisis led to the suppression of student strikes by security forces in all major academic centres across the country and the subsequent repression of the Polish dissident movement. It was also accompanied by mass emigration following an antisemitic (branded \\"anti- Zionist\\") campaign waged by the minister of internal affairs, General Mieczys≈Çaw Moczar, with the approval of First Secretary W≈Çadys≈Çaw Gomu≈Çka of the Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR).

The anti-Jewish campaign began in 1967, and was carried out in conjunction with the USSR's withdrawal of all diplomatic relations with Israel after the Six-Day War, but also involved a power struggle within the PZPR itself. The subsequent purges within the ruling party, led by Mieczys≈Çaw Moczar and his faction, failed to topple Gomu≈Çka's government but resulted in an exile from Poland of thousands of individuals of Jewish ancestry, including professionals, party officials and secret police functionaries. In carefully staged public displays of support, factory workers across Poland were assembled to publicly denounce Zionism.Dariusz Stola. \\"\\"The Anti-Zionist Campaign in Poland of 1967‚Äì1968.\\" The American Jewish Committee research grant.

At least 13,000 Poles of Jewish origin emigrated in 1968‚Äì72 as a result of being fired from their positions and various other forms of harassment.Dariusz Stola, Kampania antysyjonistyczna w Polsce 1967 - 1968 [The Anti-Zionist Campaign in Poland 1967‚Äì1968], pp. 213, 414, published by Instytut Studi√≥w Politycznych Polskiej Akademii Nauk, Warsaw 2000, Andrzej Leon Sowa, Historia polityczna Polski 1944‚Äì1991 [The Political History of Poland 1944‚Äì1991], pp. 346‚Äì347, Wydawnictwo Literackie, Krak√≥w 2011, Book review at Historia.org.pl.Monika Krawczyk (March 2013), Nie zapomnƒô o Tobie, Polsko!

Background The political turmoil of the late 1960s was exemplified in the West by the increasingly violent protests against the Vietnam War and included numerous instances of protest and revolt, especially among students, that reverberated across Europe in 1968. The movement was reflected in the Eastern Bloc by the events of the Prague Spring, which began on 5 January 1968. A wave of protests in Czechoslovakia marked the high point of a broader series of dissident social mobilization. According to Ivan Krastev, the 1968 movement in Western Europe, with its emphasis on individual sovereignty, was fundamentally different from that in the Eastern Bloc, concerned primarily with national sovereignty, and this dichotomy is reflected in the different societal models that have since evolved in the respective parts of the continent.Krastev, Ivan. (21 February 2018). Will 2018 Be as Revolutionary as 1968?. The New York Times. Retrieved 28 February 2018. In Poland, a growing crisis having to do with communist party control over universities, the literary community, and intellectuals in general, marked the mid-1960s. Those persecuted for political activism on campus included Jacek Kuro≈Ñ, Karol Modzelewski, Adam Michnik, Barbara Toru≈Ñczyk and a number of others.Barbara Toru≈Ñczyk, Opowie≈õci o pokoleniu 1968. Dwutygodnik No. 09/2009. A decade earlier, Poland was a scene of the Pozna≈Ñ 1956 protests and the Polish October events. Reaction to Arab‚ÄìIsraeli war of 1967 W≈Çadys≈Çaw Gomu≈Çka with Leonid Brezhnev in Berlin on 17 April 1967 The events of 1967 and Polish communist leaders' necessity to follow the Soviet lead altered the relatively benign relations between People's Poland and Israel. The combination of international and domestic factors gave rise in Poland to a campaign of hate against purported internal enemies, among whom the Jews would become the most salient target.Dariusz Stola, Kampania antysyjonistyczna w Polsce 1967 - 1968, pp. 7‚Äì14 As the Israeli‚ÄìArab Six-Day War started on 5 June 1967, the Polish Politburo met the following day and made policy determinations, declaring condemnation of \\"Israel's aggression\\" and full support for the \\"just struggle of the Arab countries\\". First Secretary W≈Çadys≈Çaw Gomu≈Çka and Prime Minister J√≥zef Cyrankiewicz went to Moscow on 9 June for a Middle East conference of communist leaders. The participants deliberated in a depressing atmosphere. The decisions made included the Warsaw Pact's continuation of military and financial support for the Arab states and the breaking of diplomatic relations with Israel, in which only Romania refused to participate.Dariusz Stola, Kampania antysyjonistyczna w Polsce 1967 - 1968, pp. 29‚Äì46 A media campaign commenced in Poland and was soon followed by \\"anti-Israeli imperialism\\" rallies held in various towns and places of employment. After the government delegation's return to Warsaw, Gomu≈Çka, pessimistic and fearful of a possible nuclear confrontation and irritated by the reports of support for Israel among many Polish Jews, on 19 June proclaimed at the Trade Union Congress that Israel's aggression had been \\"met with applause in Zionist circles of Jews ‚Äì Polish citizens.\\" Gomu≈Çka specifically invited \\"those who feel that these words are addressed to them\\" to emigrate, but Edward Ochab and some other Politburo members objected and the statement was deleted before the speech's publication. Gomu≈Çka did not issue a call for anti-Jewish personnel purges, but the so-called \\"anti- Zionist\\" campaign got underway anyway, supported by his close associates Zenon Kliszko and Ignacy Loga-Sowi≈Ñski. It was eagerly amplified by General Mieczys≈Çaw Moczar, minister of internal affairs, by some military leaders who had long been waiting for an opportunity to \\"settle with the Jews\\", and by other officials. A list of 382 \\"Zionists\\" was presented at the ministry on 28 June and the purge slowly developed, beginning with Jewish generals and other high-ranking officers of the Polish armed forces.Andrzej Leon Sowa, Historia polityczna Polski 1944‚Äì1991, pp. 334‚Äì336 About 150 Jewish military officers were fired in 1967‚Äì68, including Czes≈Çaw Mankiewicz, national air defense chief. Minister of Defense Marian Spychalski tried to defend Mankiewicz and by doing so compromised his own position.Dariusz Stola, Kampania antysyjonistyczna w Polsce 1967 - 1968, pp. 69‚Äì78 The Ministry of Internal Affairs renewed its proposal to ban the Jewish organizations from receiving foreign contributions from the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee. This time, unlike on previous occasions, the request was quickly granted by the Secretariat of the PZPR's Central Committee and the well-developed Jewish social, educational and cultural organized activities in Poland faced stiff reductions or even practical liquidation.Dariusz Stola, Kampania antysyjonistyczna w Polsce 1967 - 1968, pp. 47‚Äì68 About 200 people lost their jobs and were removed from the party top leadership in 1967, including Leon Kasman, chief editor of Trybuna Ludu, the party's main daily newspaper. Kasman was Moczar's hated rival from the time of the war when he arrived from the Soviet Union and was parachuted into Poland. After March 1968, when Moczar's ministry was finally given the freehand it had long sought, 40 employees were fired from the editorial staff of the Polish Scientific Publishers (PWN). This major state publishing house had produced a number of volumes of the official Great Universal Encyclopedia. Moczar and others protested in the fall of 1967 the supposedly unbalanced treatment of World War II issues, namely stressing Jewish martyrdom and the disproportionate numbers of Jews killed in Nazi extermination camps. In the words of Polish scholar W≈Çodzimierz Rozenbaum, the Six-Day War \\"provided Gomu≈Çka with an opportunity 'to kill several birds with one stone': he could use an \\"anti-Zionist\\" policy to undercut the appeal of the liberal wing of the party; he could bring forward the Jewish issue to weaken the support for the nationalist faction (in the party) and make his own position even stronger...\\" while securing political prospects for his own supporters.W≈Çodzimierz Rozenbaum, CIAO: Intermarium, National Convention of the American Association for the Advancement of Slavic Studies, Atlanta, Ga., 8‚Äì11 October 1975. On 19 June 1967, Gomu≈Çka warned in his speech: \\"We don't want an establishment of a fifth column in our country\\". The sentence was deleted from a published version,Dariusz Stola, Kampania antysyjonistyczna w Polsce 1967 - 1968, p. 274 but such views he repeated and developed further in successive speeches, for example on 19 March 1968. On 27 June 1967, the first secretary characterized Romania's position as shameful, predicted production of nuclear arms by Israel and spoke generally of consequences faced by people who had \\"two souls and two fatherlands\\".Dariusz Stola, Kampania antysyjonistyczna w Polsce 1967 - 1968, pp. 277‚Äì279 Following Gomu≈Çka's anti- Israel and anti-Jewish rhetoric, the security services began screening officials of Jewish origin and looking for 'hidden Zionists' in Polish institutions. Protest in Warsaw Dziady theatrical event and its cancellation triggered student protests and violent response by the authorities The outbreak of the March 1968 unrest was seemingly triggered by a series of events in Warsaw, but in reality, it was a culmination of trends accumulating in Poland over several years. The economic situation was deteriorating and a drastic increase in the prices of meat came into effect in 1967. In 1968, the market was destabilized further by rumors of upcoming currency exchange and the ensuing panic. Higher norms were enforced for industrial productivity with wages reduced at the same time. First Secretary Gomu≈Çka was afraid of all changes. The increasingly heavy censorship stifled intellectual life, the boredom of stagnation and the mood of hopelessness (lack of career prospects) generated social conflict.Andrzej Leon Sowa, Historia polityczna Polski 1944‚Äì1991, p. 346 The disparity between the expectations raised by the Polish October movement of 1956 and the actuality of the \\"real socialism\\" life of the 1960s led to mounting frustration.Dariusz Stola, Kampania antysyjonistyczna w Polsce 1967 - 1968, pp. 13‚Äì27 At the end of January 1968, after its poor reception by the Central Committee of the ruling PZPR, the government authorities banned the performance of a Romantic play by Adam Mickiewicz called Dziady (written in 1824), directed by Kazimierz Dejmek at the National Theatre, Warsaw. It was claimed that the play contained Russophobic and anti-Soviet references and represented an unduly pro-religion stance. Dziady had been staged 14 times, the last time on 30 January. The ban was followed by a demonstration after the final performance, which resulted in numerous police detentions.Adam Leszczy≈Ñski, Marzec '68 [March 68]. 7 March 2014. Marzec '68 . wyborcza.pl. Retrieved 10 March 2014. Dejmek was expelled from the party and subsequently fired from the National Theatre. He left Poland and returned in 1973, to continue directing theatrical productions. In mid-February, a petition signed by 3,000 people (or over 4,200, depending on the source) protesting the censorship of Dziady was submitted to parliament by student protester Irena Lasota. Gathered for an extraordinary meeting on 29 February with over 400 attendees, the Warsaw chapter of the Polish Writers' Union condemned the ban and other encroachments on free speech rights.Andrzej Leon Sowa, Historia polityczna Polski 1944‚Äì1991, p. 338 The speakers blamed the faction of Minister Moczar and the party in general for antisemitic incidents, as that campaign was gaining traction. On 4 March, the removal from the University of Warsaw of dissidents Adam Michnik and Henryk Szlajfer, members of the Komandosi group, was announced by officials. A crowd of some 500 (or about 1,000) students rallying at the university on 8 March was attacked violently by organized \\"worker activists\\" (probably plainclothes police) and by police in uniform. Nonetheless, other institutions of higher learning in Warsaw joined the protest a day later. Student- and intellectual-led movement Historian Dariusz Gawin of the Polish Academy of Sciences pointed out that the March 1968 events have been mythologized in subsequent decades beyond their modest original aims, under the lasting influence of former members of Komandosi, a left-wing student political activity group. During the 1968 crisis, the dissident academic circles produced very little in terms of written accounts or programs. They experienced a moral shock because of propaganda misrepresentations of their intentions and actions and the unexpectedly violent repressions. They also experienced an ideological shock, caused by the reaction of the authorities (aggression) and society (indifference) to their idealistic attempts to bring about revolutionary reform in the Polish People's Republic. The alienation of the reform movement from the ostensibly socialist system (and their own leftist views) had begun. The students were na√Øve in terms of practical politics, but their leaders professed strongly leftist convictions, expressed in brief proclamations distributed in 1968. Following the spirit of the 1964 \\"revisionist\\" manifesto by Karol Modzelewski and Jacek Kuro≈Ñ, they demanded respect for the ideals of the Marxist‚ÄìLeninist \\"dictatorship of the proletariat\\" and principles of socialism. The protesting students sang \\"The Internationale\\" anthem.Barbara Polak, Pytania, kt√≥re nale≈ºy postawiƒá. O Marcu ‚Äô68 z Andrzejem Chojnowskim i Paw≈Çem Tomasikiem rozmawia Barbara Polak.

The storming of Warsaw University by the (fake) factory worker activists thus came as a total surprise to the students.Dariusz Gawin (19 Sep 2005), Marzec 1968 ‚Äì potƒôga mitu ('March 1968 ‚Äì the power of the myth').

The participants of the 8 March rally were met with violent beatings from ORMO volunteer reserve and ZOMO riot squads just as they were about to go home.Piotr Osƒôka (08.03.2008), . Gazeta Wyborcza. The disproportionately brutal reaction of the security forces appeared to many observers to be a provocation perpetrated to aggravate the unrest and facilitate further rounds of repression, in the self-interest of political leaders. A comparable demonstration originated on 9 March at the Warsaw University of Technology and was also followed by confrontations with the police and arrests. Kuro≈Ñ, Modzelewski and Michnik were imprisoned again and a majority of the Komandosi members were detained.Andrzej Leon Sowa, Historia polityczna Polski 1944‚Äì1991, pp. 339‚Äì340 In later accounts, however, the founding mythology of Poland's civil society movement (the late 1970s) and then of the establishment of the new democratic-liberal Poland would obliterate the socialist, leftist and revolutionary aspects of the March 1968 movement. Within a few days protests spread to Krak√≥w, Lublin, Gliwice, Katowice, and ≈Å√≥d≈∫ (from 11 March), Wroc≈Çaw, Gda≈Ñsk, and Pozna≈Ñ (12 March). The frequent demonstrations at the above locations were brutally suppressed by the police. Mass student strikes took place in Wroc≈Çaw on 14‚Äì16 March, Krak√≥w on 14‚Äì20 March, and Opole. A student committee at Warsaw University (11 March) and an inter-university committee in Krak√≥w (13 March) were formed; attempts to organize were also made in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ and Wroc≈Çaw. Efforts aimed at getting industrial workers involved, for example, employees of the state enterprises in Gda≈Ñsk, Wroc≈Çaw and Krak√≥w's Nowa Huta produced no tangible effects. But on 15 March in Gda≈Ñsk, 20,000 students and workers marched and fought several types of security forces totalling 3,700 men, into the late evening.Andrzej Leon Sowa, Historia polityczna Polski 1944‚Äì1991, p. 342 University students comprised less than 25% of those arrested for participating in opposition activities in March and April 1968 (their numerical predominance in the movement was a part of the subsequent myth, wrote historian ≈Åukasz Kami≈Ñski). The leading role in the spreading countrywide street protests was played by young factory workers and secondary school students.≈Åukasz Kami≈Ñski, Protesty studenckie. Historia. Marzec1968.pl IPN. Repressions A media campaign besmirching targeted groups and individuals was conducted from 11 March. The Stalinist and Jewish (\\"non-Polish\\") roots of the supposed instigators were \\"exposed\\" and most printed press participated in the propagation of slander, with the notable exceptions of Polityka and Tygodnik Powszechny. Mass \\"spontaneous\\" rallies at places of employment and in squares of major cities took place. The participants demanded \\"Students resume their studies, writers their writing\\", \\"Zionists go to Zion!\\", or threatened \\"We'll tear off the head of the anti- Polish hydra\\". On 14 March, regional party secretary Edward Gierek in Katowice used strong language addressing the Upper Silesian crowds: (people who want to) \\"make our peaceful Silesian water more turbid ... those Zambrowskis, Staszewskis, S≈Çonimskis and the company of the Kisielewski and Jasienica kind ... revisionists, Zionists, lackeys of imperialism ... Silesian water will crush their bones ...\\".Andrzej Leon Sowa, Historia polityczna Polski 1944‚Äì1991, pp. 340‚Äì341Jerzy Eisler, Siedmiu wspania≈Çych poczet pierwszych sekretarzy KC PZPR [The Magnificent Seven: First Secretaries of KC PZPR], Wydawnictwo Czerwone i Czarne, Warszawa 2014, , pp. 272-275 Gierek introduced a new element during his speech: a statement of support for First Secretary Gomu≈Çka, who so far had been silent on the student protests, Zionism and other currently pressing issues. This initial reluctance of the top leadership to express their position ended with a speech by Gomu≈Çka on 19 March. He eliminated the possibility of government negotiations with the strikers, extinguishing the participants' hope for a quick favorable settlement. Gomu≈Çka's speech, delivered before three thousand (\\"outstanding during the difficult days\\") party activists, was full of anti-intelligentsia accusations. The party management realized, he made it clear, that it was too early to fully comprehend and evaluate the nature and scope of the present difficulties. Gomu≈Çka sharply attacked the opposition leaders and named the few writers he particularly abhorred (Kisielewski, Jasienica and Szpota≈Ñski), but offered a complex and differentiated analysis of the situation in Poland (S≈Çonimski was named as an example of a Polish citizen whose sentiments were \\"cosmopolitan\\").Dariusz Stola, Kampania antysyjonistyczna w Polsce 1967 - 1968, pp. 115‚Äì135 The first secretary attempted to pacify the growing antisemitic wave, asserting that most citizens of Jewish origin were loyal to Poland and were not a threat. Loyalty to Poland and socialism, not ethnicity, was the only criterion, the party valued highly those who had contributed and was opposed to any phenomena of antisemitic nature. It was understood that some people could feel ambivalent about where they belonged, and if some felt definitely more closely connected with Israel, Gomu≈Çka expected them to eventually emigrate. However, it may have been too late for such reasoned arguments and the carefully screened audience did not react positively: their collective display of hatred was shown on national television. Gomu≈Çka's remarks (reviewed, corrected and approved in advance by members of the Politburo and the Central Committee) were criticized a few days later at the meeting of first secretaries of the provincial party committees and the anti- Zionist campaign continued unabated.Andrzej Leon Sowa, Historia polityczna Polski 1944‚Äì1991, p. 343 The internal bulletin of Mieczys≈Çaw Moczar's Ministry of Internal Affairs spoke of a lack of clear declaration on Zionism on Gomu≈Çka's part and of \\"public hiding of criminals\\". Such criticism of the top party leader was unheard of and indicated the increasing influence and determination of Moczar's faction. In public, Moczar concentrated on issuing condemnations of the communists who came after the war from the Soviet Union and persecuted Polish patriots (including, from 1948, Gomu≈Çka himself, which may in part explain the first secretary's failure to dissociate himself from and his tacit approval of anti-Jewish excesses). The purges and attempts to resolve the power struggle at top echelons of the party entered their accelerated phase. The mass protest movement and the repressions continued throughout March and April. The revolt was met with the dissolution of entire academic departments, the expulsion of thousands of students and many sympathizing faculty members (including Zygmunt Bauman, Leszek Ko≈Çakowski and Stefan ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski), arrests and court trials.Andrzej Brzeziecki, Marcowy rechot Gomu≈Çki [Gomu≈Çka's March gurgle of laughter]. 12 March 2013. Marcowy rechot Gomu≈Çki. wyborcza.pl. Retrieved 14 March 2014. National coordination by the students was attempted through a 25 March meeting in Wroc≈Çaw; most of its attendees were jailed by the end of April. On 28 March, students at the University of Warsaw reacted to the firing of prominent faculty by adopting the Declaration of the Student Movement, which presented an outline of mature systemic reforms for Poland. The document formulated a new framework for opposition activities and established a conceptual precedent for the future Solidarity opposition movement postulates. The authorities responded by eliminating several university departments and enlisting many students in the military.Andrzej Leon Sowa, Historia polityczna Polski 1944‚Äì1991, pp. 344‚Äì345 The student protest activities, planned for 22 April, were prevented by the arrest campaign conducted in Warsaw, Krak√≥w and Wroc≈Çaw. At least 2,725 people were arrested between 7 March and 6 April. According to internal government reports, the suppression was effective, although students were still able to disrupt the May Day ceremonies in Wroc≈Çaw. Except for the relatively few well- recognized protest leaders, the known participants of the 1968 revolt generally did not reappear in later waves of opposition movement in Poland.Andrzej Friszke,, Intermarium, Volume 1, Number 1, 1997; translated from Polish. Original published in Wiez (March 1994). By mid-March, the protest campaign had spread to smaller towns. The distribution of fliers was reported in one hundred towns in March, forty in April, and, despite numerous arrests, continued even during the later months. Street demonstrations occurred in several localities in March. In different cities, the arrests and trials proceeded at a different pace, in part because of the discretion exercised by local authorities. Gda≈Ñsk had by far the highest rate of both the \\"penal-administrative procedures\\" and the cases that actually went to courts. The largest proportion of the arrested and detained nationwide during the March/April unrest belonged to the \\"workers\\" category. A few dared to openly defend the students, including some writers, bishops, and the small parliamentary group of Catholic deputies Znak, led by Jerzy Zawieyski. Znak submitted an official interpellation on 11 March, addressed to the prime minister. They questioned the brutal anti-student interventions by the police and inquired about the government's intentions regarding the democratic demands of the students and of the \\"broad public opinion\\". Following the Politburo meeting on 8 April, during which Stefan Jƒôdrychowski strongly criticized the antisemitic campaign but a majority of the participants expressed the opposite view or supported Gomu≈Çka's \\"middle\\" course, a Sejm session indirectly dealt with the crisis on 9‚Äì11 April. Prime Minister J√≥zef Cyrankiewicz asserted that the Radio Free Europe used the Znak interpellation for its propaganda. Other speakers claimed that the interpellation was primarily aimed at getting the hostile foreign interests involved in Poland's affairs. Zawieyski spoke in a conciliatory tone, directing his comments and appealing to Gomu≈Çka and Zenon Kliszko, recognizing them as victims of the past (Stalinist) political persecution. He interpreted the recent beating by \\"unknown assailants\\" of Stefan Kisielewski, a Catholic publicist, as an attack on a representative of the Polish culture. The party leaders responded by terminating Zawieyski's membership in the Polish Council of State, a collective head of state organ, and banning him from holding a political office in the future. The participants in the public Sejm debate concentrated on attacking Znak and avoided altogether discussing the events and issues of the March protests or their suppression (the subjects of the interpellation). The effectiveness of the ORMO interventions on university campuses and the eruption of further citizen discontent (see 1970 Polish protests) prompted the Ministry of Public Security to engage in massive expansion of this force, which at its peak in 1979 reached over 450,000 members. Anti-Jewish mobilization and purges, party politics General Mieczys≈Çaw Moczar initiated and led the widespread antisemitic campaign of 1968 In March 1968, the anti- Jewish smear campaign, loud propaganda and mass mobilization were greatly intensified. The process of purging Jewish and other officials, ex-Stalinists, high-ranking rival communists and moral supporters of the current liberal opposition movement, was accelerated.Dariusz Stola, Kampania antysyjonistyczna w Polsce 1967 - 1968, pp. 79‚Äì114 Roman Zambrowski, Stefan Staszewski, Edward Ochab, Adam Rapacki and Marian Spychalski were among the top echelon party leaders removed or neutralized. Zambrowski, a Jewish veteran of the Polish communist movement, was singled out and purged from the party first (13 March), even though he had been politically inactive for several years and had nothing to do with the current crisis. Former First Secretary Ochab resigned his several high offices to protest \\"against the antisemitic campaign\\".Andrzej Leon Sowa, Historia polityczna Polski 1944‚Äì1991, p. 344 On 11 April 1968, the Sejm instituted changes in some major leadership positions. Spychalski, leaving the Ministry of Defense, replaced Ochab in the more titular role as the chairman of the Council of State. Wojciech Jaruzelski became the new minister of defense. Rapacki, another opponent of antisemitic purges, was replaced by Stefan Jƒôdrychowski at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. A new higher education statute was designed to give the government greater control over the academic environment. Gomu≈Çka considered revisionism rather than \\"Zionism\\" to be the main \\"danger\\". According to historian Dariusz Stola, the first secretary, whose wife was Jewish, harbored no antisemitic prejudices. But he opportunistically and instrumentally allowed and accepted the anti- Jewish initiative of Minister Moczar and the secret services Moczar controlled. The campaign gave Gomu≈Çka the tools he needed to combat the intellectual rebellion, prevent it from spreading into the worker masses (by \\"mobilizing\\" them and channelling their frustration against the stealth and alien \\"enemy\\"), resolve the party rivalries ultimately to his own advantage and stabilize the situation in Poland at the dangerous for the party time of the Prague Spring liberalizing movement in Czechoslovakia. Many Poles (irrespective of ethnic background) were accused of being Zionists. They were expelled from the party and/or had their careers terminated by policies that were cynical, prejudicial, or both. Long (sometimes conducted over several days) party meetings and discussions took place at the end of March and in early April within various state institutions and enterprises. They dealt with the \\"Zionism\\" issue and were devoted to the identification of those responsible and guilty (within the institution's own ranks), their expulsion from the party and demands for their removal from the positions they held. Attempts were made to steer the attention of the general public away from the student movement and advocacy for social reform, centered around the defense of freedom of speech for intellectuals and artists and the right to criticize the regime and its policies. Moczar, the leader of the hardline Stalinist faction of the party, blamed the student protests on \\"Zionists\\" and used the protest activity as a pretext for a larger antisemitic campaign (officially described as \\"anti-Zionist\\") and party purges. In reality, the student and intellectual protests were generally not related to Zionism or other Jewish issues. The propagated idea of the \\"Zionist inspiration\\" of student rebellion originated in part from the presence of children of Jewish communists among those contesting the political order, including especially members of the Komandosi group. To augment their numbers, figures of speech such as the \\"Michniks, Szlajfers, Zambrowskis\\" were used. The national strike call from Warsaw (13 March) opposed both antisemitism and Zionism.George Katsiaficas, The Imagination of the New Left: A Global Analysis of 1968, pp. 66‚Äì70. One banner hung at a Rzesz√≥w high school on 27 April read: \\"We hail our Zionist comrades.\\" However, Gomu≈Çka warned that \\"Zionism and antisemitism are two sides of the same nationalist medal\\" and insisted that communism rejects all forms of nationalism. According to Gomu≈Çka, who rejected the Western allegations of antisemitism, \\"Official circles in the United States have involved themselves in the dirty anti-Polish campaign by making statements accusing Poland of antisemitism. We propose that the ruling circles in the United States check whether American citizens of Polish descent have ever had or have now the same opportunities that Polish citizens of Jewish descent have for good living conditions and education and for occupying positions of responsibility. Then it would emerge clearly who might accuse whom of national discrimination.\\" He went on to say that \\"the Western Zionist centers that today charge us with antisemitism failed to lift a finger when Hitler's genocide policies exterminated Jews in subjugated Poland, punishing Poles who hid and helped the Jews with death.\\"The New York Times. May 2, 1968 The party leader was responding to a wave of Western criticism and took advantage of some published reports that were incompatible with the Polish collective memory of historical events, World War II and the Holocaust in particular. The Moczar challenge, often presented in terms of competing political visions (he was the informal head of the nationalist communist party faction known as \\"the Partisans\\"), reflected, according to historian Andrzej Chojnowski, primarily a push for a generational change in the party leadership and at other levels, throughout the country. By 1968 Gomu≈Çka, whose public relations skills were poor, was unpopular and had lost touch with the population he ruled. Personnel changes, resisted by Gomu≈Çka, were generally desired and expected, and in the party, General Moczar was the alternative. Large numbers of generally younger functionaries mobilized behind him, motivated by the potential opportunity to advance their stagnant careers. Finding scapegoats (possibly by just claiming that someone was enthusiastic about the Israeli victory) and becoming their replacements meant in 1968 progress in that direction. The Moczar faction's activity was one of the major factors that contributed to the 1968 uproar, but the overdue generational change within the party materialized fully only when Edward Gierek replaced Gomu≈Çka in December 1970.Andrzej Werblan, Miejsce ekipy Gierka w dziejach Polski Ludowej [The role of the Gierek's team in the history of People's Poland]. The role of the Gierek's team. PrzeglƒÖd socjalistyczny www.przeglad-socjalistyczny.pl. Retrieved 28 March 2014. Moczar himself campaigned ruthlessly in an ultimately failed attempt to become Gomu≈Çka's replacement or successor. Emigration of Polish citizens of Jewish origin In a parliamentary speech on 11 April 1968, Prime Minister Cyrankiewicz spelled out the government's official position: \\"Loyalty to socialist Poland and imperialist Israel is not possible simultaneously. ... Whoever wants to face these consequences in the form of emigration will not encounter any obstacle.\\" The departing had their Polish citizenship revoked. Historian David Engel of the YIVO Institute wrote: \\"The Interior Ministry compiled a card index of all Polish citizens of Jewish origin, even those who had been detached from organized Jewish life for generations. Jews were removed from jobs in public service, including from teaching positions in schools and universities. The pressure was placed upon them to leave the country by bureaucratic actions aimed at undermining their sources of livelihood and sometimes even by physical brutality.\\"The YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe: Poland since 1939 by David Engel According to Dariusz Stola of the Polish Academy of Sciences, \\"the term 'anti-Zionist campaign' is misleading in two ways since the campaign began as an anti-Israeli policy but quickly turned into an anti-Jewish campaign, and this evident anti-Jewish character remained its distinctive feature\\". The propaganda equated Jewish origins with Zionist sympathies and thus disloyalty to communist Poland. Antisemitic slogans were used in rallies. Prominent Jews, supposedly of Zionist beliefs, including academics, managers and journalists, lost their jobs. According to the Polish state's Institute of National Remembrance (IPN), which investigated events that took place in 1968‚Äì69 in ≈Åod≈∫, \\"in each case the decision of dismissal was preceded by a party resolution about expelling from the party\\". According to Jonathan Ornstein, of the 3.5 million Polish Jews prior to World War II, 350,000 or fewer remained after the Holocaust.Ornstein, Jonathan. (26 February 2018). In Poland, a Grass-Roots Jewish Revival Endures. The New York Times. Retrieved 17 March 2018. Most survivors who claimed their Jewish nationality status at the end of World War II, including those who registered with the Central Committee of Polish Jews in 1945, had emigrated from postwar Poland already in its first years of existence. According to David Engel's estimates, of the fewer than 281,000 Jews present in Poland at different times before July 1946, only about 90,000 were left in the country by the middle of 1947. Fewer than 80,000 remained by 1951, when the government prohibited emigration to Israel. An additional 30,000 arrived from the Soviet Union in 1957, but almost 50,000, typically people actively expressing Jewish identity, left Poland in 1957‚Äì59, under Gomu≈Çka and with his government's encouragement. Approximately 25,000‚Äì30,000 Jews lived in Poland by 1967. As a group, they had become increasingly assimilated and secular and had well-developed and functioning Jewish secular institutions. Of the Jews who stayed in Poland, many did so for political and career reasons. Their situation changed after the 1967 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli war and the 1968 Polish academic revolt when the Jews were used as scapegoats by the warring party factions and pressured to emigrate en masse once more. According to Engel, some 25,000 Jews left Poland during the 1968‚Äì70 period, leaving only between 5,000 and 10,000 Jews in the country. From the end of World War II, the Soviet-imposed government in Poland, lacking strong popular support, found it expedient to depend disproportionately on Jews for performing clerical and administrative jobs and many Jews rose to high positions within the political and internal security ranks. Consequently, as noted by historian Michael C. Steinlauf ‚Äì \\"their group profile ever more closely resembled the mythic ≈ªydokomuna\\" (see also Jewish Bolshevism).Michael C. Steinlauf. \\"Poland.\\" In: David S. Wyman, Charles H. Rosenzveig. The World Reacts to the Holocaust. The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1996. .Steven Elliott Grosby, Athena S. Leoussi.

For complex historical reasons, Jews held many positions of repressive authority under the post-war Polish communist administrations. In March 1968, some of those officials became the center of an organized campaign to equate Jewish origins with Stalinist sympathies and crimes. The political purges, often ostensibly directed at functionaries of the Stalinist era, affected all Polish Jews regardless of background. Prior to the 1967‚Äì68 events, Polish-Jewish relations had been a taboo subject in communist Poland. Available information was limited to the dissemination of shallow and distorted official versions of historical events, while much of the traditional social antisemitic resentment was brewing under the surface, despite the scarcity of Jewish targets. Popular antisemitism of the post-war years was closely linked to anticommunist and anti-Soviet attitudes and as such was resisted by the authorities. Because of this historically right-wing orientation of Polish antisemitism, the Jews generally felt safe in communist Poland and experienced a \\"March shock\\" when many in the ruling regime adopted the antisemitic views of pre-war Polish nationalists to justify an application of aggressive propaganda and psychological terror. The Stalinist in many respects character of the campaign was paradoxically combined with anti- Stalinist and anti-≈ªydokomuna rhetoric.Dariusz Stola, Kampania antysyjonistyczna w Polsce 1967 - 1968, pp. 145‚Äì150 The media \\"exposed\\" various past and present Jewish conspiracies directed against socialist Poland, often using prejudicial Jewish stereotypes, which supposedly added up to a grand Jewish anti-Polish scheme. West German-Israeli and American-Zionist anti-Poland blocs were also \\"revealed\\". In Poland, it was claimed, the old Jewish Stalinists were secretly preparing their own return to power, to thwart the Polish October gains. The small number of Jews remaining in Poland were subjected to unbearable pressures generated by the state monopolistic media, often dominated by sympathizers of Minister Moczar. Many Jews and non-Jews were smeared and removed by their local Basic Party Organizations (POP), after which they had to be fired from their jobs. Many professionals and non-members of the party fell victim as well.Dariusz Stola, Kampania antysyjonistyczna w Polsce 1967 - 1968, pp. 150‚Äì188 Most of the last wave (1968‚Äì69) of emigrants chose destinations other than Israel, which contradicted the government's claim of their pro-Israeli devotion. Disproportionately in Polish society, they represented highly educated, professional, and accomplished people. Some communist party activists had previously perceived this factor as an undue \\"density\\" of Jews in positions of importance, a remnant of Stalinist times, which resulted in calls for their marginalization and removal from the country.Dariusz Stola, Kampania antysyjonistyczna w Polsce 1967 - 1968, pp. 135‚Äì143 The Catholic Church and Catholic intelligentsia circles engaged in defense of protesting students, but remained silent on the issue of anti- Jewish campaign and the consequent exodus of Polish Jews.Jakub Majmurek, Dziwna rocznica ('A strange anniversary').

Between 1961 and 1967, the average rate of Jewish emigration from Poland was 500‚Äì900 persons per year.Communiqu√©: Investigation regarding communist state officers who publicly incited hatred towards people of different nationality. Institute of National Remembrance, Warsaw. Publication on Polish site of IPN: July 25th, 2007. In 1968, a total of 3,900 Jews applied to leave the country. Between January and August 1969, the number of emigrating Jews was almost 7,300, all according to records of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The security organs maintained comprehensive data on persons with \\"family background in Israel\\" or of Jewish origin, including those dismissed from their positions and those who did not hold any official positions but applied for emigration to Israel. Termination of the \\"anti-Zionist\\" campaign On 11 April 1968, Secretary of the Central Committee Artur Starewicz gave Gomu≈Çka a comprehensive letter, in which he pointed out the destructiveness of the demagoguery, anti-Jewish obsession and other aspects of the campaign.Dariusz Stola, Kampania antysyjonistyczna w Polsce 1967 - 1968, pp. 235‚Äì255 In late April Gomu≈Çka realized that the campaign he allowed had outlived its usefulness and was getting out of control; many participants became overzealous and complaints from various quarters multiplied. However, ending it and restoring normal party control and discipline took several weeks of repeated warnings and other efforts. On 24 June, Gomu≈Çka sharply criticized Stefan Olszowski, the party propaganda chief and the role played by the PAX publications. Both were heavily involved in the \\"anti-Zionist\\", but also \\"nationalistic\\" media campaign from 11 March. On 1 July, Leopold Domb (Leopold Trepper), former chairman of the Sociocultural Association of Jews (in Poland), wrote a letter to his party boss Gomu≈Çka. Domb bitterly complained of the progressive liquidation of the thousand years of Polish-Jewish civilizational achievement and listed numerous instances of such destruction of society and culture taking place in contemporary communist Poland.Dariusz Stola, Kampania antysyjonistyczna w Polsce 1967 - 1968, pp. 379‚Äì380 On 5 July, Gomu≈Çka acknowledged \\"certain problems\\" with the Ministry of Internal Affairs and announced the removal of Minister Moczar from the cabinet position, which disconnected him from his power base at that department. Moczar's sidelining was presented as a promotion: he became secretary of the Central Committee and a deputy member of the Politburo.Andrzej Leon Sowa, Historia polityczna Polski 1944‚Äì1991, pp. 347‚Äì350 \\"Comrade Moczar is a disciplined man and he'll do as he is told\\", was how Gomu≈Çka saw the resolution. Gomu≈Çka's ability to decisively dismantle the Internal Affairs' anti-Jewish smear campaign and punish its perpetrators (for challenging the party leadership) shows that he could have done so earlier, had he chosen to act in a timely manner. During the XII Plenum of the Central Committee (8‚Äì9 July), Zenon Kliszko officially closed the \\"anti-Zionist\\" campaign. Internal attacks and obstruction within the party, the military and the security services (SB), now directed against Gomu≈Çka and Kliszko, continued for some time. In reality, SB's \\"anti-Zionist\\" activities were never completely abandoned. During 1970‚Äì80, General Jaruzelski demoted to the rank of private 1,348 Jewish officers who had emigrated, not only around 1968. Such continued activities were conducted in secret.Dariusz Stola, Kampania antysyjonistyczna w Polsce 1967 - 1968, pp. 257‚Äì268 The media propaganda machine was by early summer preoccupied with denouncing the Prague Spring. In August, the Polish People's Army participated in the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia.Andrzej Leon Sowa, Historia polityczna Polski 1944‚Äì1991, pp. 357‚Äì358 Consequences of the events of 1968 The Fifth Congress of the PZPR took place in November, under Gomu≈Çka' s active lead. His position was confirmed. The gathering, numerically dominated by the supporters of Moczar, was maneuvered into complying with Gomu≈Çka faction's personnel decisions. The party now had 2.1 million members (only 40% were workers), after the recent purging of over 230,000. The Jewish activists were gone, but many other veterans remained, as the generational change in the communist leadership was beginning to take place. Gomu≈Çka was able to rule with his few close associates until December 1970, but his prestige suffered in Poland, abroad, and among the Soviet and other Eastern Bloc leaders. A consequence of the protest events and their repercussions was the alienation of the regime from the leftist intelligentsia, who were disgusted at the official promotion of antisemitism and the adoption of nationalistic rhetoric.Andrzej Friszke, Andrzej Paczkowski, Roman Graczyk, Komunizm, intelektuali≈õci, Ko≈õci√≥≈Ç ('Communism, intellectuals, the Church'). Komunizm, intelektuali≈õci, Ko≈õci√≥≈Ç. 13 October 2010, Tygodnik Powszechny www.tygodnikpowszechny.pl. Retrieved 07 March 2018. Many Polish intellectuals opposed the government campaign, often openly. Another effect was the activity by Polish emigrants to the West in organizations that encouraged opposition within Poland. The alienation of Polish intelligentsia had a long afterlife and eventually contributed to the downfall of the communist dictatorship: the 1968 events were a turning point in the ideological evolution of those who would challenge the system in the years to come. Jacek Kuro≈Ñ, for example, twice a party member and an activist imprisoned for his participation in the 1968 events, later played important roles in the Workers' Defence Committee and the Solidarity workers' movement. The events of 1968, preceded by those in 1956 and followed by those of 1970, 1976 and 1980, showed that Poland, with its strong nationalist traditions, a civil society, and the powerful Catholic Church, was the source of instability and weakness in the Eastern Bloc. The dangers presented to the PZPR by the \\"reactionary\\" coalition of 1968, against which some had already warned back then, turned out not to be imaginary, but their realization took another two decades. The antisemitic, anti-intellectual and anti-student campaign damaged Poland's reputation, particularly in the West. Despite the worldwide condemnation of the March 1968 repressions, for many years the communist governments would not admit the antisemitic nature of the \\"anti-Zionist\\" campaign, though some newspapers published critical articles. In February and March 1988, the Polish communist government announced official apologies for the antisemitic excesses of 1968: first in Israel at a conference on Polish Jewry, and then in a statement printed in Trybuna Ludu.David Ost, Solidarity and the Politics of Anti-Politics, p. 231, 1990 Philadelphia, Temple University Press, A Central Committee report even suggested an introduction of double citizenship to improve relations with the Jews who left Poland. Aftermath Part of a permanent exhibition dedicated to the March events at the POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews in Warsaw. After the fall of the communist rule, the Sejm in 1998 issued an official condemnation of the antisemitism of the March 1968 events. In 2000, President Aleksander Kwa≈õniewski gave his own apology in front of a group of Jewish students \\"as the president of Poland and as a Pole\\". On the 30th anniversary of their departures, a memorial plaque was placed at Warszawa Gda≈Ñska train station, from which most of the exiled Poles took a train to Vienna. Following the rise in antisemitic rhetoric in Poland in the wake of the controversial Act on the Institute of National Remembrance, in March 2018 Polish President Andrzej Duda said \\"We are sorry you're not here today\\" and \\"those were deported then and the families of those who were killed ‚Äì I want to say, please forgive Poland for that\\" in relation to the 20,000 Jews expelled or forced to flee in 1968. However, Duda said that his generation was not responsible for the actions of the past communist administration.https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/poland- s-president-apologizes-for-1968-expulsion-of-jews-1.5887427 Poland's President Apologizes for 1968 Purge of Jews, Haaretz, 08.03.18 Duda's distinction between the past Polish government whom he framed as culpable, and Polish citizens whom he framed as innocent, was seen as a non-apology by critics. Duda's statement also echoed Jewish stereotypes in framing the loss to Poland: \\"You are the elite of the intelligentsia but in other countries, you are people of remarkable success, respected, but in other countries, your creative powers, your scientific output, your splendid achievements have not done credit to the Republic of Poland\\".https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/03/09/polands- president-offers-a-nonapology-apology-for-68-anti-semitic-purge-the-holocaust- bill-is-still-on-the-books/ Poland‚Äôs president offers a nonapology apology for ‚Äô68 anti-Semitic purge.

Predictive learning is one attempt to learn with a minimum of pre-existing mental structure. It may have been inspired by Piaget's account of how children construct knowledge of the world by interacting with it. Gary Drescher's book 'Made-up Minds' was seminal for the area.

The song was published by Michael Ross Limited, whose directors included Louis Carris, Ross Parker and Norman Keen. Keen, an English pianist also collaborated with Parker and Hughie Charles on \\"We'll Meet Again\\" and many other songs published by the company, including \\"There'll Always Be an England\\" and \\"I'm In Love For The Last Time\\". The song is one of the most famous of the Second World War era, and resonated with soldiers going off to fight as well as their families and sweethearts. The song's original recording featured Lynn accompanied by Arthur Young on Novachord (an early synthesizer), while a rerecording in 1953 featured a more lavish instrumentation and a chorus of British Armed Forces personnel. The song gave its name to the 1943 musical film We'll Meet Again in which Lynn played the lead role (see 1943 in music). Lynn's 1953 recording is featured in the final scene of Stanley Kubrick's 1964 film Dr. Strangelove ‚Äì with a bitter irony, as the song accompanies a nuclear holocaust that wipes out humanity. It was also used in the closing scenes of the 1986 BBC television serial The Singing Detective. British director John Schlesinger used the song in his 1979 World War II film Yanks, which is about British citizens and American soldiers during the military buildup in the UK as the Allies prepare for the Normandy landings. During the Cold War, Lynn's recording was included in the package of music and programmes held in 20 underground radio stations of the BBC's Wartime Broadcasting Service (WTBS), designed to provide public information and morale-boosting broadcasts for 100 days after a nuclear attack. The song reached number 29 on the U.S. charts. Lynn sang the song in London on the 60th anniversary of VE Day in 2005. In April 2020, a charity duet with Katherine Jenkins, released in 2014, reached number 72 on the UK Singles Chart, with proceeds going to NHS charities. In May 2020 following the 75th Anniversary celebrations of VE Day, the solo version by Lynn also reached number 55 in the UK chart. Other performances * Traditionally, this song is played on 5 May as a closure to the Liberation Day Concert in Amsterdam, to mark the end of World War II in the Netherlands, as the monarch leaves the concert on a canal boat. * The Byrds recorded the song as the closing track of their debut album Mr. Tambourine Man in 1965, inspired by the song's use in Dr. Strangelove. * In 1980 the Viennese singer Margot Werner released a German version called Mu√ü ich auch geh'n. Unlike Lilli Marlene, which was popular with troops on both sides during World War Two, Mu√ü ich auch geh'n is little known in Germany. * Johnny Cash recorded a cover version as part of his 2002 album American IV: The Man Comes Around, the last album released in his lifetime. =In film and television= * On the final episode of The Colbert Report, the song was sung by Stephen Colbert in a more upbeat tempo with members of his family and an assembled crowd of many of his most prominent guests. * The song was sung by Alfie Boe and Katherine Jenkins during the final performance at VE Day 70: A Party to Remember at Horse Guards Parade in London in 2015. * On the film Kong: Skull Island, John C. Reilly's character starts singing the song to a picture of his wife who he has not seen in decades, as he is on the way to be rescued. Vera Lynn's version then starts playing, and is also featured in the soundtrack album. * The first trailer of season 3 of Westworld uses the song as the theme of the trailer. A song with same name composited by Ramin Djawadi is also used in the last episode of season 2. * On the animated television show, Gravity Falls, the main antagonist of the series, Bill Cipher, sang it in the episode \\"Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back the Falls\\". * Rebecca Sugar, the creator of the Steven Universe series, also sang the song during the live stream with Alex Hirsch, Ian Jones-Quartey and Francisco Angones * In Episode 6 of the French WW2 Animated Series The Long Long Holiday, Colonel Douglas sang the song to Gaston from his music culture. =References in other works= * On her last radio show, NPR host Liane Hansen quoted the song in her farewell address to listeners. *On 5 April 2020, Queen Elizabeth II referenced the song in a rare televised address that aired in the UK, where she expressed her gratitude for the efforts people are taking to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic virus and acknowledged the severe challenges being faced by families across the world. The reference spurred covers by West End theatre stars with Lynn, Katherine Jenkins with Lynn, and by drag queens.https://www.queerty.com/watch-drag-queens-perform-powerful-well-meet- help-elders-20200424 Queerty Jenkins' version was released on iTunes as a benefit for the NHS Charities Together. * In May 2020, Scottish comedian Limmy made a techno remix of the song which was live-streamed to thousands of people on his Twitch platform.

The book, a New York Times Best Seller, revolves around Frank Bama and his ex- girlfriend, hemorrhoid-ointment heiress Trevor Kane. Frank, a down-on-his-luck seaplane pilot, is about to escape to Alaska when Trevor unexpectedly jumps back into his life asking for his help in tracking down her brother, the notorious rock star Joe Merchant. Other characters joining Frank and Trevor in their search include sleazy tabloid reporter Rudy Breno, rocket scientist Desdemona, many mercenaries, and the Jet Ski Killer. The Arecibo Observatory is featured in the book and the lyrics to the song \\"Desdemona's Building A Rocket Ship\\". In both, a talented baker and former backup singer named Desdemona has a tryst with one of the workers \\"under the giant telescope\\", and begins receiving telepathic messages from the Pleiades, telling her to build a spaceship and \\"come home\\". Characters=Desdemona= Desdemona, a major character in the novel but not its protagonist, is a psychic based on a small island off the coast of Hispaniola. She finds her mission to be the building of a rocket ship to travel to the Pleiades. Lacking both science knowledge and working capital, she bases her rocket ship on the long abandoned rusting hulk of an airplane fuselage that had once belonged to Howard Hughes. While theoretically under construction, her ship the Cosmic Muffin also serves as her houseboat and hosts her bakery business. Desdemona's psychic abilities involve nearly random reception of messages (usually phrased as riddles, much to her consternation) concerning both life itself and the eponymous search for Joe Merchant. She and Joe Merchant first cross paths in the 1960s in San Francisco. As their paths developed, she became a backup singer in Merchant's band, and was once married to an associate of Merchant's. Following the breakup of both her band and her marriage, and the descent of Merchant into the drug world (Desdemona herself was famed for her pot-brownies while in San Francisco), she worked her way south through the midwestern states, then to Mexico, where her interest in Astronomy and psychic ability was cultivated. Ultimately, she arrived in the small Caribbean island of Little Lorraine. This characterization of Desdemona also appears in several of Buffett's songs, including \\"Fruitcakes\\" and \\"Desdemona's Building a Rocket Ship\\" from his album Banana Wind.

He joined the D-Company in 1988 under the kingpin Dawood Ibrahim, and is reportedly responsible for managing the day-to-day operations of the criminal group. Shakeel became one of the most-wanted men in India after his alleged participation in the 1993 Bombay bombings. He is also wanted by the U.S. government for international drug trafficking. In January 2017, Shakeel was rumored dead by multiple sources.  Early life  Chhota Shakeel was born in Bombay, Maharashtra, India, on 31 December 1955 or 1960. His birth name was Mohammed Shakeel Babu Miyan Shaikh. Prior to joining organized crime, Shakeel ran a dubious travel agency in Dongri, Mumbai. In 1988, he joined the D-Company, a criminal group based in South Asia, while stationed in Dubai. He was one of its earliest members along with Bishal Cheetah, Johnny Akhawat and Liger Bhai or Mushu Bhai. According to his Interpol criminal profile, Shakeel is tall, has black-colored hair and eyes, and speaks Hindi, English, and Urdu. During his early years in the D-Company, Sharad Shetty ran match fixes, betting and hawala deals for D-Company leader Dawood Ibrahim, while Chhota Rajan headed criminal activities in Mumbai. After the 1993 Bombay bombings and a split between Dawood and Rojan's factions, Shakeel was promoted to an executive role within the D-Company by befriending Dawood. As a leader of the D-Company, Shakeel reportedly oversaw the day-to-day operations of the criminal group. In the D-Company, Shakeel was known as the CEO, and reported directly to Dawood. According to the Maharashtra police, he reportedly received support from the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), Pakistan's intelligence agency, in his criminal operations. After the Bombay attacks, Shakeel sought refuge in Pakistan under the protection of the ISI.  Career = 1980s ‚Äì 2000s = Shakeel is one of the most-wanted men in India. He is wanted for murder, extortion, and terrorism, the last charge stemming from his alleged involvement in the 1993 Bombay bombings. After the attacks, Shakeel worked with Rahim Merchant (alias \\"Dogla\\"), a wealthy Pakistani from North Karachi, to create a voice proxy. Shakeel did this to conceal his voice while having conversations abroad, and wrote what he wanted to say to Merchant, who worked as his speaker. This helped keep Shakeel under authorities' radar. Through Merchant, Shakeel brokered deals for the D-Company, conducted extortion activities, and helped run many arms operations on the ISI's behalf. Authorities believe that even if Shakeel was in fact dead, his voice impersonator Merchant would likely continue mimicking his voice to continue running criminal activities. Authorities suspect that Shakeel was responsible for international drug trafficking operations for D-Company, and worked with Afghan and Colombian suppliers. He was also interested in arms trafficking and real-estate, and bought several mines in Africa to begin his illegal diamond mining business. Shakeel reportedly smuggled diamonds for the Ukrainian mafia group Odessa and bartered them for weapons. In addition to his Indian passport, Shakeel had two more ‚Äì from Botswana and the other from Malawi ‚Äì to presumably help him in his diamond business. The diamonds were smuggled by African nationals from countries like Sierra Leone, Guinea and the Republic of Mali. They were collected for further distribution in Botswana, South Africa and Namibia. They were then taken to Kenya, and then shipped to Dubai and Pakistan. Shakeel reportedly had real estate in countries like the United States, India, Pakistan, Morocco, Algeria, Sierra Leone, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates, Kenya, Spain and South Africa. Shakeel was one of the mentors of the former gangster Abu Salem. He entrusted him with overseeing Bollywood's finances and acquiring their film rights abroad. Their partnership eventually ended and Salem branched out of the D-Company. In 1997, Shakeel reportedly claimed responsibility for the murder of social activist SM Khalid, the Bombay Bakers Association President, in Dongri. In September 2000, Shakeel openly agreed to have ordered an attack against Rajan, who was based out of Indonesia. In 2001, he was interviewed by India Today and claimed to have financed several Hindi films. = 2010s ‚Äì present = On 15 May 2012, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), a branch of the United States Department of the Treasury, sanctioned Shakeel and D-Company high-ranking leader Tiger Memon under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (Kingpin Act). According to the OFAC, Shakeel and his criminal group were involved in international drug trafficking since the late 1980s. The narcotics smuggled included heroin and hashish, which were brought from Afghanistan and Thailand and imported illegally into the United States, Western Europe, the Middle East, Latin America, and Africa. As part of this sanction, U.S. citizens were prohibited from engaging in business activities with Shakeel, and his assets under U.S. jurisdiction were also frozen. In mid-2016, D-company lieutenant and Dawood's brother Anees Ibrahim had a fallout with Skaheel over the D-Company's operations in Dubai. Anees wanted to oust Shakeel of his leadership role. Shakeel organized a faction within the D-Company to counter Anees' efforts. Dawood refused to take sides since he wanted to keep his friendship with Shakeel and ties with his sibling Anees. Other high- ranking leaders of the D-Company were confused with whose orders to follow, and this infighting created tensions within the criminal group. In 2016, the police were able to gain possession of a photograph of Shakeel after it was taken during a birthday party of another suspect involved in the Bombay attacks. Shakeel was caught on camera for the first time in the 1980s, and the picture remained the only photograph of him for at least three decades. During these years, Shakeel was suspected of living in a mansion near Karachi, Pakistan. In 2017, Dawood's brother Iqbal Kaskar was arrested for extortion by the Thane police. In that criminal case, Shakeel was accused of helping Iqbal by help him threaten people for money. Investigators stated that Iqbal's arrest worsened the ties between Shakeel and Anees.  Rumored death  In December 2017, Shakeel was rumored dead after an audio clip of a man claiming to be Dawood stated that he had died in Karachi, Pakistan on 7 January 2017. Another source, citing an unnamed Indian intelligence officer based in the U.S., stated that Shakeel died of a heart attack in Dushanbe, Tajikistan. In the clip, a man known as Bilal was heard telling a relative of Shakeel that Shakeel had died of a heart attack and that Dawood's brother Anees was taking his earnings. The Royal Thai Police had reportedly sent a letter to the Interpol saying that Shakeel was dead and was no longer subject to the Interpol's Red Notice. An investigation conducted by India Today TV in 2018 concluded that this scheme was fake. The letter provided by the Royal Thai Police was signed by Piya Uthayo, an officer that was employed in another department. The police discovered that the fax number used to send the letter to the Interpol was based out of Bangkok, Thailand. The probe led to the arrest of a German-national who confessed to the Bangkok police that he was sent to Thailand to send the letter on orders from an Indian-national. Investigators believe that Dawood was responsible for planning this scheme after disagreements with Shakeel. Dawood's brother Anees and Shakeel have tried to take over the D-Company's second-in-command position. India Today TV tried reaching Shakeel for comment but his three mobile numbers were unreachable. There are several versions explaining how Shakeel reportedly died. One version suggests that he died of a heart attack shortly after a meeting with members of Odessa in Islamabad. He was reportedly transported by air to a hospital in Rawalpindi, but was declared dead upon arrival. Dawood reportedly got ill after learning about Shakeel's death two days later. He was admitted to the hospital twice, on January and March 2017, and experienced depression. Sources close to the crime boss stated that he was contemplating to return to India. Most of Shakeel's alleged associates, Bilal, Mohammed Rashid, Iqbal Salim, Yusuf Raja, and Parvez Khawaja, reportedly left the D-Company after his death. Other unconfirmed reports that that Shakeel had broken away from Dawood's partnership prior to his death. Sources close to Dawood's inner circle stated that Anees took over the operations headed by Shakeel on 5 January 2019. D-Company was reportedly not able to find a replacement for Shakeel's void in Tajikistan and took longer than expected to appoint a successor.

Baca was born in Socorro, New Mexico, to Francisco and Juana Maria Baca. His family moved to Topeka, Kansas, when he was a young child. Upon his mother‚Äôs death in 1880, Baca returned with his father to Belen, New Mexico, where his father became a marshal. In 1884, at age 19, Baca acquired some guns and became a deputy sheriff (whether through purchasing a badge or by being appointed is unclear) in Socorro County, New Mexico. His goal in life was to be a peace officer. He wanted, he said, ‚Äúthe outlaws to hear my steps a block away.‚Äù Southwestern New Mexico at the time was still relatively sparsely settled cattle ranching country. Frisco shootout The Frisco Store in Middle Frisco Plaza In October 1884, in the town of Middle San Francisco Plaza (now Reserve, New Mexico), Elfego Baca arrested a drunk cowboy named Charlie McCarty. Baca flashed his badge at McCarty and took Charlie's gun. McCarty's fellow cowboys tried to take him by force, but Baca resisted and opened fire on the cowboys, killing the horse of John Slaughter's foreman, which fell on him and killed him. Baca shot another cowboy in the knee. Subsequently, Justice of the Peace Ted White granted McCarty's freedom and summoned Bert Hearne, a rancher from Spur Lake Ranch, to bring Baca back to the Justice for questioning relating to what the Justice considered murder. After Baca refused to come out of the adobe jail, Hearne broke down the door and ordered Baca to come out with his hands up. Soon after that, shots volleyed from the jail and hit Hearne in the stomach, resulting in his death. A standoff with the cowboys ensued. The number of cowboys that gathered has been disputed, with villagers at the scene reporting about forty present while Baca himself later claimed there had been at least eighty. Allegedly, the cowboys fired more than 4,000 shots into the house, until the adobe building was full of holes. Incredibly, not one of the bullets struck Baca. (The floor of the home is said to have been slightly lower than ground level; thus Baca was able to escape injury.) During the siege, Baca shot and killed four of his attackers and wounded eight others. After about 33 hours and roughly 4,000 rounds of open fire, the battle ended when Francisquito Naranjo persuaded Baca to surrender. In May 1885, Baca was charged with murder for the death of John Slaughter's foreman and Bert Hearne and was jailed awaiting trial. In August 1885, Baca was acquitted after the door of Armijo‚Äôs house was entered as evidence. It had more than 400 bullet holes in it. The incident became known as the Frisco shootout. Purportedly, Baca's defense attorney had false documentation to prove Baca's legal deputization because Baca's biography suggests he deputized himself just before the arrest of Charlie McCarty. Law and order Baca officially became the sheriff of Socorro County and secured indictments for the arrest of the area's lawbreakers. Instead of ordering his deputies to pursue the wanted men, he sent each of the accused a letter. It said, \\"I have a warrant here for your arrest. Please come in by March 15 and give yourself up. If you don‚Äôt, I‚Äôll know you intend to resist arrest, and I will feel justified in shooting you on sight when I come after you.\\" Most of the offenders turned themselves in voluntarily. In 1888, Baca became a U.S. Marshal. He served for two years and then began studying law. In December 1894, he was admitted to the bar by Judge A.A. Freeman and briefly joined Freeman's Socorro law firm in February 1895.William A. Keleher, Memoirs, Episodes in New Mexico History, 1892-1969 (Sunstone Press, 2008), p. 179.\\"Judge A.A. Freeman,\\" Old Abe Eagle, 28 February 1895, p. 1. He practiced law on San Antonio Street in El Paso between 1902 and 1904. Political life Baca held a succession of public offices, including county clerk, mayor and school superintendent of Socorro County and district attorney for Socorro and Sierra counties. In his book The Shooters, historian Leon Metz writes that ‚Äúmost reports say he was the best peace officer Socorro ever had.‚Äù From 1913 to 1916, Baca served as the official U.S. representative of Victoriano Huerta's government during the Mexican Revolution. In April 1915, Baca was charged with criminal conspiracy for allegedly masterminding the November 1914 escape of Mexican general Jos√© In√©s Salazar from the Albuquerque jail.Bryan, Howard Incredible Elfego Baca: Good Man, Bad Man of the Old West\\", p. 68-76 Successfully defended by the New Mexican lawyer and politician Octaviano Larrazolo, Baca's reputation grew among Southwestern residents. When New Mexico became a state in 1912, Baca unsuccessfully ran for Congress as a Republican. Nevertheless, he remained a valued political figure because of his ability to turn out the vote among the Hispanic population. Working at times as a private detective, Baca also took a job as a bouncer in a casino across the border in Ciudad Ju√°rez, Mexico. Baca worked closely with New Mexico‚Äôs longtime Senator Bronson Cutting as a political investigator and wrote a weekly column in Spanish praising Cutting‚Äôs work on behalf of local Hispanics. Baca considered running for governor despite his declining health, but he failed to secure the Democratic Party‚Äôs nomination for district attorney in 1944. Metz, his biographer, wrote: ‚ÄúElfego was, and is, controversial. He drank too much; talked too much ... he had a weakness for wild women. He was often arrogant and, of course, he showed no compunction about killing people.‚Äù On his 75th birthday, Baca told the Albuquerque Tribune that as a lawyer he had defended 30 people charged with murder and that only one went to the penitentiary. In July 1936, several years before his death, Janet Smith conducted an interview with Elfego Baca. Her notes can be found in the Library of Congress, Manuscript Division, WPA Federal Writers‚Äô Project Collection. Baca told Smith, ‚ÄúI never wanted to kill anybody, but if a man had it in his mind to kill me, I made it my business to get him first.‚Äù Legends Another legend says that Baca stole a pistol from Pancho Villa and the angry Villa put a price of $30,000 on Baca‚Äôs head. One often-told story says that once when he was practicing law in Albuquerque, Baca received a telegram from a client in El Paso, Texas. \\"Need you at once,\\" it said. \\"Have just been charged with murder,\\" to which Baca is supposed to have responded with a telegram saying, \\"Leaving at once with three eyewitnesses.\\"Howard Bryan, 'Incredible Elfego Baca' 1993, pg 3 Portrayal in popular media In the late 1950s, Walt Disney turned Baca into the first Hispanic popular culture hero in the United States, on television miniseries, in six comic books, in a feature film, and in related merchandising. However, Disney deliberately avoided ethnic tension by presenting Baca as a generalized Western hero, portraying a standard hero similar to Davy Crockett, in Hispanic dress.Ferenc Morton Szasz, \\"A New Mexican\\" Davy Crockett\\": Walt Disney's version of the Life and Legend of Elfego Baca.\\" Journal of the Southwest (2006) 48#3: 261-274. excerpt Starting in October 1958, Walt Disney Studios released a 10-part television serial entitled The Nine Lives of Elfego Baca starring Robert Loggia in the title role. Special edition of American Cowboy magazine. Page 28: \\"Walt Disney, the only producer of 1950s TV Westerms to focus on minority issues, powerfully told the full story of Baca's career in a ten-episode mini-series for ABC between 1958-1960, starring Robert Loggia. The title The Nine Lives of Elfago Baca, played off the hero's nickname 'El Gato,' the cat.\\" The serial aired as part of Walt Disney Presents from October 3, 1958 to March 25, 1960. Disney took significant care to depict the famous siege in as authentic a manner as possible, given the known details. Among those who appeared in the series were Skip Homeier, Raymond Bailey, and I. Stanford Jolley. Episodes of the series were later edited into a 1962 movie titled Elfego Baca: Six Gun Law. The theme song's tag line was, \\"And the legend was that / Like el gato, \\"the cat\\" / Nine lives had Elfego Baca.\\" In 1966, the film Elfego Baca: Six Gun Law was released. It was directed by Christian Nyby and starred Robert Loggia as Elfego Baca. The film premiered in theaters in West Germany on May 20, 1966 and was later broadcast on American television with the title Elfego Baca: Attorney at Law.

He was played by Steven Hill from 1990 to 2000. Schiff was one of the original main characters of the series and appeared in every episode of the first 10 seasons except for \\"Everybody's Favorite Bagman\\", which was produced before Hill joined the cast, and the season-seven episode \\"D-Girl\\". He appeared in 229 episodes (228 episodes of Law & Order and the Law & Order: Special Victims Unit episode \\"Entitled\\"), and was the last original character to leave the show's main cast.  Character overview  Schiff is District Attorney of New York County, and a graduate of Columbia University, where he served on the Law Review. He began his career as an ADA in 1973. He is a pragmatic Democrat of faintly liberal stripe, but regardless of political inclinations, he is never perturbed by his critics nor by uncooperative judges. Political persuasions sometimes cloud his decisions with regard to certain cases such as the death penalty; however, he has moral objections to capital punishment, having written a brief protesting it in 1971, but is not averse to seeking it against a defendant if voters want such a sentence carried out. He is also pro-choice. While he is often stern and unforgiving in his professional conduct, he has amicable relationships with his assistants. He is closest to Benjamin Stone (Michael Moriarty), and is saddened to see him resign when a witness he is trying to protect is murdered. His relationship with Stone's successor, Jack McCoy (Sam Waterston), is more problematic, as McCoy is more ruthless and unconventional, and his habitual bending of trial rules occasionally garners Schiff bad publicity. However, the two eventually grow to like and respect each other. He has many friends among New York's elite, including powerful politicians, judges, and businessmen. Over the show's run, however, many of these friends prove themselves to be either corrupt or hiding secrets. The politician who first asked that he run for district attorney, Edward Vogel (George Martin), later tries to use their relationship to quash the prosecution of his son's murderer to avoid having his son's homosexuality revealed. In another case, one of his closest friends, Judge Edgar Hynes (Louis Zorich), commits suicide after being caught taking bribes. Another, Carl Anderton (Robert Vaughn), a high-powered CEO, is discovered to be suffering from bipolar disorder and attempts to arrange an unjust punishment for his similarly affected grandson Terence (Sam Huntington), who had killed his half-sister during a manic phase, to hide his own condition. The once solid friendship destroyed, Anderton seeks vengeance and backs Schiff's opponent Gary Feldman (Cliff Gorman) in a primary election; Schiff nevertheless is reelected. In a 1997 episode, Schiff's wife has a stroke that puts her in a vegetative state, and dies after he elects to have her taken off life support. Their son Josh is mentioned in several episodes, as are Josh's own wife and son, but he never appears on screen. Schiff is a fan of the Boston Red Sox and Columbia Lions football. After Law & Order In 2000, the Schiff character was written out of the show to accommodate Hill's resignation. Within the story arc of the show, Schiff leaves the DA's office to accept a role in coordinating commemorations of the Holocaust Project. He goes on to work with Simon Wiesenthal. He is succeeded by Nora Lewin (Dianne Wiest). After McCoy becomes the district attorney in 2007, he commented that he now understands why Schiff always seemed to be in a bad mood. In 2009, Schiff is said to be in Africa with former President Jimmy Carter, attempting to get into Zimbabwe. While in Africa, he sees an article about McCoy's election campaign on the Internet and lends him his support. Real-life models The character of Adam Schiff is loosely based upon long-serving New York County, Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau.

History Established in 1988 as Korea Tourism University, Gyeongju University originally consisted of five departments: the Department of Tourism Business Administration, the Department of Tourism and Public Administration, the Department of Tourism Development, the Department of Cultural Assets and The Department of English and Tourism. The university expanded in later years to include several other departments, as well as a graduate school (founded in 1995). In 1993, the university changed its name to its current one. In September 2013, the university was one of thirty-five private colleges and universities that were cut off from all government aid and prohibited from participating in any federally funded research. The cuts were done at least in part as a response to the fast-approaching sharp decline in college-age students. The schools designated were those constituting the lowest scoring schools based on an eight-factor evaluation. Academics Although tourism remains a major focus of the university, Gyeongju University has also made efforts to develop and promote programs in high-tech fields such as information technology and computer science. In addition, the school's continuing education center gives local residents the opportunity to further their education in various fields. Like most universities in Korea, the academic year begins in February‚ÄìJune (1st Semester) and ends in September to December (2nd Term), with a summer and winter vacation between semesters. Campus Life The campus of Gyeongju University is situated on the slopes of Mt. Sondo in the western outskirts of Gyeongju. Although many of the students commute to and from the school from their homes in surrounding areas, the opening of a student dormitory in 2004 gave students the chance to live on campus. The university holds two festivals yearly for the students and members of the community: a school festival, typically held in the spring, and a sports festival held in the autumn.

It is defined to be the supremum of the set of projective dimensions of all A-modules. Global dimension is an important technical notion in the dimension theory of Noetherian rings. By a theorem of Jean-Pierre Serre, global dimension can be used to characterize within the class of commutative Noetherian local rings those rings which are regular. Their global dimension coincides with the Krull dimension, whose definition is module-theoretic. When the ring A is noncommutative, one initially has to consider two versions of this notion, right global dimension that arises from consideration of the right A-modules, and left global dimension that arises from consideration of the left A-modules. For an arbitrary ring A the right and left global dimensions may differ. However, if A is a Noetherian ring, both of these dimensions turn out to be equal to weak global dimension, whose definition is left-right symmetric. Therefore, for noncommutative Noetherian rings, these two versions coincide and one is justified in talking about the global dimension.  Examples  Let A = K[x1,...,xn] be the ring of polynomials in n variables over a field K. Then the global dimension of A is equal to n. This statement goes back to David Hilbert's foundational work on homological properties of polynomial rings, see Hilbert's syzygy theorem. More generally, if R is a Noetherian ring of finite global dimension k and A = R[x] is a ring of polynomials in one variable over R then the global dimension of A is equal to k + 1\\\\. The first Weyl algebra A1 is a noncommutative Noetherian domain of global dimension one. A ring has global dimension zero if and only if it is semisimple. The global dimension of a ring A is less than or equal to one if and only if A is hereditary. In particular, a commutative principal ideal domain which is not a field has global dimension one. *If a ring is right Noetherian, then the right global dimension is the same as the weak global dimension, and is at most the left global dimension. In particular if a ring is right and left Noetherian then the left and right global dimensions and the weak global dimension are all the same. *The triangular matrix ring \\\\begin{bmatrix}\\\\mathbb Z&\\\\mathbb Q \\\\\\\\\\\\0&\\\\mathbb Q \\\\end{bmatrix} has right global dimension 1, weak global dimension 1, but left global dimension 2. It is right Noetherian but not left Noetherian.  Alternative characterizations  The right global dimension of a ring A can be alternatively defined as: * the supremum of the set of projective dimensions of all cyclic right A-modules; * the supremum of the set of projective dimensions of all finite right A-modules; * the supremum of the injective dimensions of all right A-modules; * when A is a commutative Noetherian local ring with maximal ideal m, the projective dimension of the residue field A/m. The left global dimension of A has analogous characterizations obtained by replacing \\"right\\" with \\"left\\" in the above list. Serre proved that a commutative Noetherian local ring A is regular if and only if it has finite global dimension, in which case the global dimension coincides with the Krull dimension of A. This theorem opened the door to application of homological methods to commutative algebra.  References  * . * * . * .

When the street was widened, two additional lanes were added between the western Corporation Line and Wasigo Drive (to create a dual turn lane), with one additional lane between Wasigo Drive and Corbly Street. Sidewalks, trees and curbs were also added along the route as well as a bike lane into the business district. Schools Three grade schools are located in Mount Washington: * Sands Montessori (Corbly Street, Cincinnati Public Schools), a magnet school now housed in a new building (2011) on the site formerly housing the Eastern Hills Elementary and Junior High Schools * Mt. Washington Elementary School (Mears Avenue, Cincinnati Public Schools), a neighborhood school offering a state-of-the-art Expiditionary Learning program for students, with a high-quality pre-school program rating five stars on the Step Up to Quality scale from the Ohio Department of Jobs and Family Services. * Guardian Angels School (6539 Beechmont Avenue, Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cincinnati). The Guardian Angels Campus, constructed in 1931, 1942, 1949, and 1963‚Äì1971, was designed by architect Edward J. Schulte. The Archbishop McNicholas High School (Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cincinnati) is also located in Mount Washington, across from Guardian Angels. Mount Washington is also home to the Athenaeum of Ohio (Mt. St. Mary's Seminary of the West), located at the eastern gateway to Mount Washington, the intersection of Beechmont Avenue and Burney Lane. The campus is owned by the Archdiocese of Cincinnati and is known for its architecture. Many of the records for the Archdiocese of Cincinnati are located at the campus library. It is common to see the Franciscan Monks walking or riding their bikes, barefoot, throughout the neighborhood. Parks Cincinnati Park Board operates the Stanbery Park on Oxford Avenue between Corbly Street and Crestview Place. This park is named after Brigadier General Sanford B. Stanbery, who was the highest-ranking officer from Hamilton County in World War I. The Tudor-style Stanbery house used to be located on park grounds, but was demolished as part of a park improvement program. The park facilities include a paved walking area, hiking trails, playground equipment, and a picnic shelter. Mt. Washington Cemetery is located on Sutton Ave. Community events The Pumpkin Chuck is held the first Saturday in November at Stanbery Park Three large festivals are held throughout the year in Mt. Washington. Guardian Angels Church conducts a large church festival in the summer, complete with games, food, live music and gambling. The Pumpkin Chuck, produced by the Mt. Washington Community Council, is held the first Saturday after Halloween. The highlight of this festival is the three hand-built trebuchets, while launch pumpkins into the Stanbery Park ravine. The Holiday Walk, produced by MWCURC, is held the first Saturday after Thanksgiving. Businesses offer free activities and games for families, choirs from local schools perform, free carriage rides are offered, Santa takes pictures with children, and a ceremonial lighting of the Mt. Washington Water Tower ends the event. An Independence Day parade is held each year, on a route going through the business district on Beechmont Ave. Additionally, Sands Montessori has a large carnival held in the fall, and the American Legion Post 484 has a carnival the first weekend in August.

The village, once a major town, is located on the Old Hume Highway between Canberra and Sydney. It was previously known officially as the Town of Berrima. It is close to the three major towns of the Southern Highlands; Mittagong, Bowral and Moss Vale.  Etymology  The name Berrima is believed to derive from an Aboriginal word meaning either \\"southward\\" or \\"black swan\\".  History  The Surveyor General Inn at Berrima was established in 1834 Holy Trinity Anglican Church St. Francis Xavier Catholic Church The area around Berrima was once occupied by the Dharawal Aborigines. They had been driven off or killed by the 1870s. The region and Wingecarribee River was first visited by Europeans during the late 1790s, including a 1798 expedition led by an ex- convict, John Wilson. However, John and Hamilton Hume rediscovered the area in 1814. The area was explored by Charles Throsby in 1818. Runs were taken up soon after, including by one by Charles Throsby. Harper's Mansion, which is on a hill overlooking the town, was built from 1829 to 1830. Bong Bong had been planned as a major town for the county but, as it was flood prone, the New South Wales surveyor-general Thomas Mitchell chose Berrima townsite on the road running south from Sydney to Goulburn with the intention that the town be the chief centre for southern New South Wales. The survey was conducted in 1830 and the town plan was approved in 1831. As well as its being an administrative centre, there were ambitions that the town might become a commercial and manufacturing centre, \\"where the wool of Argyle and Camden might be made into cloth and the hide into leather\\". The courthouse (see below) was built between 1833 and 1838. The gaol (see below) was built from 1835 by convict labour and opened in 1839. The Surveyor General Inn was built in 1834. It has been continuously licensed since 1839 and its claim to being the earliest hotel rests on its continual licence and being in the original building. Berrima prospered as being at a point on the Old Hume Highway, and there were fourteen hotels in or near the town in the 1840s. However, because the construction of the railway bypassed the town, the population decreased ‚Äì no new houses were built for a hundred years. In 1896, Sir Henry Parkes, premier of New South Wales, planted an oak tree near the post office. There are many historic buildings in the town and the village as a whole is listed on the Register of the National Estate. Other notable buildings include the Holy Trinity Anglican Church designed by Edmund Blacket and built in 1849; and the St Francis Xavier Catholic Church built 1849‚Äì51 designed by Augustus Pugin, a notable British architect of Gothic-revival buildings. The Berrima Village Trust was established in 1963 to preserve historic buildings. Berrima was bypassed by a new section of the Hume Highway in March 1989.

NSW Heritage Office. Retrieved on 7 August 2006. It was designed by the colonial architect Mortimer Lewis in a Roman style. Four Doric columns support a classical pediment. The building is now stylistically classified as Georgian. It is built of sandstone. A number of problems arose during construction, the first architect having resigned and a succession of three builders being contracted. The first quarter-sessions were held at the court house in 1841, and the first trial by jury in the colony of New South Wales was held here. The assize courts were continued for only seven years. In 1850 the district court moved to Goulburn, south of Berrima. Minor courts continued at Berrima until 1873. Notable trials were of John Lynch, who was hanged for the murder of at least nine people, and of Lucretia Dunkley and her lover Martin Beech who were both hanged in 1843 for the murder of Dunkley's husband. Their trial is simulated in the present-day museum courtroom with realistic manikins and an audio commentary. Dunkley was the only woman to be hanged at Berrima gaol. Old Berrima Gaol  The old Berrima Gaol was, in its latter days, a training centre for female convicts This notice outside the building outlines the gaol's historical timeline Berrima Gaol was built over five years with much work done by convicts in irons. Conditions at the gaol were harsh, prisoners spent most of their days in cells and the only light was through a small grate set in the door. In 1866 the gaol was renovated to the standards described by the prison reform movement for a \\"model prison\\". However, Berrima gaol had solitary confinement cells which measured 8 feet by 5 feet, some smaller, where it was intended that all prisoners spent one year. In 1877 a royal commission was held to investigate allegations of cruelty by the prison authorities but the complaints were not upheld. During World War I the army used Berrima Gaol as a German-prisoner internment camp. Most of the 329 internees were enemy aliens from shipping companies. There were German officers from Rabaul, German New Guinea (what is now Papua New Guinea) and also officers from the light cruiser SMS Emden.Berrima DADG banner, c. 1916 at NSW Government Migration Heritage CentreBerrima Concentration Camp, World War I Documents and images at National Library of Australia The correctional centre was used most recently as an all-female low-to-medium security prison. In the 2011 NSW State Budget, the Government announced that the centre would be closed, which took effect on 4 November 2011. The Centre is scheduled to re-open in September 2016.

It formerly included the cocoa woodcreeper and the Lafresnaye's woodcreeper as subspecies. Some authorities retain Lafresnaye's position as a subspecies of the buff-throated woodcreeper, but the resulting group is polyphyletic (see Systematics and evolution). Description With a total length of , and a weight of c. 64 g, this woodcreeper is, together with Lafresnaye's woodcreeper, the largest member of the genus Xiphorhynchus. The head, neck, mantle and chest are streaked buff, and the rest of the upperparts, wings and tail are rufous. The underparts are olive-brown. The bill is long, slightly decurved, and hooked at the tip. The upper mandible is dark grey, while the lower mainly is pale greyish-horn. The normal call is a loud chev-re chev-re. Ecology Buff-throated woodcreepers are restricted to humid forest and woodland. The taxa in north-eastern South America (polystictus and connectens) are generally the commonest large woodcreeper within their range, but the nominate taxon (X. g. guttatus), which is restricted to humid tropical Atlantic forest, has a fragmented population and is generally uncommon. They are insectivores which feed on ants and other insects and spiders. It feeds low in trees, usually alone, but groups will follow columns of army ants. The species builds a bark-lined nest in a tree hole or hollow stump and lays two white eggs. Systematics and evolution The taxonomy is highly complex. The smaller cocoa woodcreeper (X. susurrans) from Central America and northwestern South America was formerly included in this species, but is now normally considered to be distinct.AOU (American Ornithologists' Union) (1998): Checklist of North American Birds (7th edition). American Ornithologists' Union, Washington, D.C. Of the remaining taxa, the pale-billed and buff- streaked guttatoides group (incl. dorbignyanus) and the dark-billed and whitish-streaked eytoni group (incl. vicinalis and gracilirostris) have often been considered separate species, as the Lafresnaye's woodcreeper (X. guttatoides) and the dusky-billed woodcreeper (X. eytoni). While visually very different, these two groups are now known to form a single cladeAleixo, Alexandre (2002): Molecular systematics, phylogeography, and population genetics of Xiphorhynchus (Aves: Dendrocolaptidae) in the Amazon basin.

Biogeography and molecular data suggest that the relationship between these subspecies and the taxa now included in X. guttatoides and X. susurrans deserves further study.Remsen, J. Van (2003): 32.

Lynx Edicions, Barcelona. Depending of the outcome of these studies, the buff-throated woodcreeper could be restricted to the southern coastal population, which is endangered by habitat fragmentation, making a change in conservation status necessary. The most likely evolutionary scenario is that from lower Amazonia, the ancestors of Lafresnaye's woodcreeper spread west- and southwestwards to the Andes, and those of the buff-throated and cocoa woodcreeper downriver and then along the coast of northern South America, where X. susurrans then branched off as the northern lineage. Indeed, it may be that the trans-Andean forms of the latter may constitute yet another good species, Lawrence's woodcreeper. =Subspecies= * X. g. guttatus (Lichtenstein, 1820).

It is sometimes called a suction dredge. A water dredge or water eductor may be used for the same purpose. Typically, the airlift is constructed from a 3-metre to 10 metre long, 10 cm diameter pipe. A controllable compressed air supply vents into the inside, lower end of the pipe (The input end always being the lower end). Compressed air is injected into the pipe in one to three second bursts with an interval long enough to let the resulting bubble to rise to the higher, output end of the pipe. The bubble moves water through the pipe sucking debris from the lower end and depositing it from the upper end of the pipe. Ejected debris can be either cast off (as in simply removing overburden) or collected in a mesh cage for inspection (as more often is the case in nautical archaeology). It is often designed to be hand-operated by a diver. Airlift pumps are used by water utilities, farmers and others to extract water from deep wells. In such cases the pipes can be 30, 60 or more meters deep underground. Airlift pumps are governed by the physics of two-phase flow.

It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on April 21, 1999. Plot Eric Cartman must go to the local eye doctor, whom he hates because the doctor always makes fun of his obesity by referring to him as \\"Piggy\\". Cartman is told that he has bad vision and has his eyes dilated; he is later given a pair of thick-rimmed glasses which are then stapled to his head so that he cannot take them off. Later, he and the other boys discover that Chef has quit his job at South Park Elementary and has been replaced by Mr. Derp, a clich√© cartoon character (who may also be a parody of Pauly Shore), who tries (and fails) to win them over with his poor slapstick comedy gags. They then find out that Chef has a new girlfriend, Veronica, (voiced by Michael Ann Young) who has caused his life to change from that of a free- spirited, soul-singing cafeteria chef to that of a mediocre office worker. She is also extremely fond of singing the love theme from The Poseidon Adventure, \\"The Morning After\\" at inappropriate times. The boys believe that she is trying to steal Chef away from them and are dismayed when they discover that the two are planning to get married. Not wanting Chef to go too, the boys seek advice from Mr. Garrison, who suggests that Veronica is a succubus: a demoness sent from Hell to prey on and suck the life out of men. The boys go to warn Chef of this, but instead they meet his parents, who tell them about their frequent meetings with the Loch Ness Monster, claiming that the beast is stalking and constantly pestering them for a sum of \\"about tree fiddy\\" ($3.50). (This is a take on constant jokes mostly from black comedians, like Richard Pryor, about unusual people asking for money or food during hard times.) Meanwhile, a botched attempt at laser eye surgery leaves Cartman temporarily blinded. While the others mock him, Veronica comes to visit them. She manages to convince them that she is not a monster but, just as she is about to leave, suddenly takes on a demonic face, laughing maniacally and declaring that they cannot stop her from marrying Chef. The boys try to tell Chef of this at the rehearsal dinner, but he angrily shuts them out. They go back to Cartman's place to formulate a plan to stop the wedding. The boys discover that a succubus controls the minds of men with a melody and that playing it backwards will vanquish it. They remember that Veronica always sings \\"The Morning After\\" and proceed to learn how to sing the song backwards. At the wedding, they play a tape of the song backwards while Stan and Kyle sing the words in reverse order. Veronica begins to lose her hold on her human form. When the tape gets jammed, she peels off her human disguise and reverts to her true shape‚Äîa bizarre, red-eyed, bat-winged, hag-like monster‚Äîflying around and wrecking the church (and killing Kenny in the process). When the boys finish singing the song, Veronica is sucked back into Hell. Chef, no longer under her evil spell, apologizes to the boys for ignoring them and eventually returns to their school as the chef and as his old self. Cartman returns to his optometrist, who tells him that, with eyes as bad as his, he will always have to wear glasses. He solves this problem by convincing the doctor to give him an eye transplant, using Kenny's frozen head as a donor. The optometrist then asks for $3.50, suggesting that Chef's parents' tales were not entirely fabricated. Production Parker and Stone say in the DVD commentary that the sketch involving the Loch Ness Monster was the inspiration for the character Chef. Originally Comedy Central wouldn't let the creators voice African-American characters on the show. The episode also introduces the word Derp. A television promo of the episode showed that the character Ms. Crabtree was originally Chef's replacement in the episode.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWCtWissSDQ&index;=9&list;=PL7PquS5NCH70xlAI7G_HqWyPElZLJ0t_B ReferencesExternal links * The Succubus Full Episode at South Park Studios * The Succubus Episode Guide at South Park Studios * * Category:1999 American television episodes Category:South Park (season 3) episodes Category:Demons in television Category:Television episodes about weddings Category:Succubi in popular culture ","title":"The Succubus (South Park)"},{"id":"2291773","text":"Desiderius is a Latin given name, related to desiderium - which can be translated as \\"ardent desire\\" or \\"the longed-for\\".

J.\\" Reynolds (July 20, 1850 ‚Äì July 29, 1918) was an American businessman and founder of the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. The son of a tobacco farmer, he worked for his father and attended Emory & Henry College from 1868 to 1870, eventually graduating from Bryant & Stratton Business College in Baltimore. He sold his share of the family business in 1874 and moved south to Winston, (now Winston-Salem, North Carolina) to start his own tobacco company. Reynolds was a savvy businessman and a hard worker, and he quickly became one of the wealthiest citizens of Winston-Salem; eventually, he was the wealthiest person in the state of North Carolina. He died in 1918 of pancreatic cancer. Biography=Early life= Reynolds was born on July 20, 1850, at Rock Spring Plantation near Critz, Patrick County, Virginia. He was the son of Nancy Jane Cox Reynolds and Hardin Reynolds, a tobacco farmer and slaveowner. He grew fond of the tobacco business by helping his father. =R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company= In 1874, Reynolds sold his interest in the family tobacco business to his father and left Patrick County to start his own tobacco company. He needed a railroad hub for his business, and since there wasn't one in Patrick County, he went to the nearest one, Winston, NC. Winston and Salem were separate towns at that time. By 1875, Reynolds had established his tobacco manufacturing operation, and in the first year, it produced 150,000 pounds of tobacco. Although Winston-Salem alone had 15 other tobacco companies, Reynolds was able to distinguish himself through his business acumen and innovative techniques, including adding saccharin to chewing tobacco. By the 1890s, production had increased to millions of pounds annually. Reynolds' younger brother, William Neal, was attending Trinity College (now Duke University) and worked part-time for him. Mr. Will, as he was known, began as a leaf-hanger and quickly mastered all facets of the operation. After leaving Trinity College, he managed tobacco purchasing. In 1888, Reynolds formed a formal partnership with Mr. Will and the company bookkeeper, Henry Roan. Reynolds served as President with 75% ownership, and Mr. Will and Henry Roan divided the remainder. The R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company was chartered as a corporation by the state of North Carolina on February 11, 1890. In 1892, Reynolds' net worth had grown to $200,000. In 1913, Reynolds developed a great innovation: the packaged cigarette. Most tobacco users who smoked cigarettes preferred to roll their own, and there was thought to be no national market for pre-packaged cigarettes. Reynolds worked to develop a flavor he thought would be more appealing than past products, creating the Camel cigarette, so named because it used Turkish paper. Reynolds undercut competitors on the cost of the cigarettes, and within a year, he had sold 425 million packs of Camels. By the time of his death, Reynolds had become the wealthiest man in North Carolina by far; his $66,000 paid annually in taxes was double the next-highest taxpayer. R.J. Reynolds had grown to encompass 121 buildings in Winston-Salem. After his death in 1918, his brother assumed control of the company; board members would wait 41 years before hanging another portrait beside Reynolds' in the R.J. Reynolds board room. Family and personal life R. J. Reynolds, circa 1890 Reynolds was the most eligible bachelor for many years in Winston-Salem and married Katharine Smith (November 17, 1880 - May 23, 1923), who was 30 years his junior, on February 27, 1905, in Mount Airy, North Carolina. She was the daughter of Zachary Taylor Smith (February 19, 1847 - June 13, 1938) and Mary Susan Jackson (January 21, 1855 - April 17, 1926). She was born in Stokes County, North Carolina and died in New York City. Reynolds and Katharine's father Zachary were cousins, and Reynolds had known Katharine since she was a young girl. She earned a degree in English literature and went to work as a Reynolds secretary, at one point winning $1,000 in a company-sponsored contest. Reynolds joked that he married Katharine to get his money back. Their marriage was very happy, and Reynolds wrote to Katharine saying he was very glad he waited so long to marry.Information displayed in Reynolda House orientation gallery, November 14, 2008 Katharine Reynolds urged her husband to shorten employees' work hours and provide a lunchroom, schools and nursery services for them. The Reynolds' children were: * Richard Joshua Reynolds, Jr. (April 4, 1906 - December 14, 1964) who married Elizabeth McCaw \\"Blitz\\" Dillard (1909 - Dec. 1961), Marianne O'Brien (d. 1985), Muriel Maud Marston Laurence Greenough (December 28, 1915 in Calgary, Alberta, Canada - 1980), and Annemarie Schmitt (b. 1932 - ) RJ Jr and Blitz had four sons, Richard Joshua \\"Josh\\" Reynolds III, John Dillard Reynolds, Zachary Taylor Reynolds, and William Neal Reynolds II. RJ Jr. and Marianne had two sons, Michael Randolph Reynolds (July 13, 1947 - November 3, 2004) and Patrick Reynolds, who publicly took a stand as a tobaccofree advocate (b. December 2, 1948 - ). RJ Jr and Annemarie had one daughter two days after RJ Jr died, Irene Sabine Reynolds (b. December 16, 1964 - ) * Mary Katharine Reynolds (August 8, 1908 - July 17, 1953) who married Charles Henry Babcock (September 22, 1899 - December 13, 1967) * Nancy Susan Reynolds (February 5, 1910 - January 1985) who married Henry Walker Bagley (August 6, 1900 in Atlanta, Georgia - April 19, 1983) and Gilbert Verney. Nancy and Henry had three daughters, Jane Bagley Lehman (married to Orin Lehman), Susan Bagley Bloom, and Anne Bagley Grant, and one son, Smith Bagley, cell phone business executive and social activist. * Zachary Smith Reynolds (November 5, 1911 - July 6, 1932) who married Anne Ludlow Cannon (August 31, 1901 - June 21, 1961) in York, South Carolina November 16, 1929 and Libby Holman in Monroe, Michigan on Sunday November 29, 1931. Reynolds lived above the factory floor for many years. When he married, he lived with his family alongside other R.J. Reynolds executives on Fifth Street in Winston-Salem until 1917, when they moved to Reynolda House, a estate on the outskirts of town that also housed a village where Reynolds workers could live. The grounds featured a post office, schools, a chapel, a blacksmith shop and a greenhouse. At Reynolda House, Katharine brought farmers together to learn the latest scientific advances in farming. Katharine offered evening literacy classes to workers. She also commissioned construction of a nine-hole golf course. Reynolds died in 1918, and his wife, although 30 years younger, died six years later. They are buried in the Salem Cemetery in Winston-Salem. Their children were then raised by their uncle, Reynolds' brother William Neal Reynolds, and his wife Kate Bitting Reynolds. Dick Reynolds became a Democratic politician, mayor of Winston-Salem, and treasurer of the Democratic National Committee. Reynolds's grandson Patrick Reynolds became an anti-smoking activist following several family deaths from smoking and began the Foundation for a Smoke-Free America. Political views In 1884, Reynolds served as a city commissioner in Winston-Salem. Reynolds established progressive working conditions in his factory, with shorter hours and higher pay. He also signed a petition for a property tax to pay for public schools and voted to approve an income tax. Lasting influence of Reynolds and his family Reynolds was generous with his workers, building schools and houses for them on his property. He also granted endowments to Guilford College, the Oxford Orphan Asylum, and the Baptist Orphanage, in addition to many other charities and churches in the Winston-Salem community. He became the first Southern man to establish a hospital serving African Americans in the South, the Slater Hospital. He started a savings and loan, served on the town board of Winston-Salem, and began a YMCA and an opera house. Reynolds donated money to the establishment of the Slater Industrial School, which would later become Winston-Salem State University. In 1923, the newly formed Reynolds Foundation fully financed the construction of Nancy Reynolds Memorial School built at the birthplace of his and Will Reynolds' mother, Nancy Jane Cox Reynolds, in the Brown Mountain community of Stokes County. In 1930, the Reynolds Foundation paid for the construction of two wings adjoining the original building. During the Depression, Will Reynolds covered the costs for an additional month of school in order for Nancy Reynolds to become accredited. In the 1950s, the foundation financed and built the school's freestanding gymnasium and built and equipped its large agricultural building. A memorial gift that still provides for the school today is a $25,000 endowment set up after the death of Kate Bitting Reynolds, Will's wife, with the yearly dividends to be used solely for the upkeep of grounds, exterior beautification projects and playground equipment. The endowment's total value is now more than three-quarters of a million dollars and easily supports its intended use. When Reynolds died, North Carolina's governor Thomas Walter Bickett said: \\"Therefore, the greatest eulogy that can be offered would be to refer to his life of rugged honesty, his wide usefulness and his kindly dealings with his fellowmen, which he himself deemed his first duty.\\" =Katharine Reynolds' philanthropy= R. J. Reynolds and his family played a large part in the public life and history of the city of Winston-Salem. After his death, his widow Katharine Smith Reynolds continued his philanthropic activities. She contributed land and funds to establish The Richard J. Reynolds High School and the R. J. Reynolds Memorial Auditorium (both listed in the National Register of Historic Places). Construction of the school and auditorium began in 1919 under the direction of architect Charles Barton Keen, and finished in 1924. Another memorial to Reynolds, an equine statue, sits on Winston-Salem City Hall Grounds in downtown Winston-Salem. A memorial to Katharine Reynolds, a 20-foot-tall obelisk, now sits on the grounds of the Richard J. Reynolds High School and R.J. Reynolds Memorial Auditorium (it was originally placed on a site in Reynolda Village, around Reynolda Church, but was rescued from demolition and moved to the site on the school grounds). =Children's philanthropy= The Reynolds' estate, Reynolda House, was completed just prior to Reynolds' death in 1918 and was later donated by his daughter, Mary Reynolds Babcock, for use as an art museum. At the age of 28, Mary inherited $30 million and became one of the world's richest women. She contributed to the William Neal Reynolds Coliseum in Raleigh, North Carolina in honor of her uncle. Her will gave $525,000 for a dormitory at Salem College in Winston-Salem. The Z. Smith Reynolds Foundation was formed by Mary Reynolds Babcock and her siblings to honor their brother, Reynolds' son Zachary, whose mysterious death at the age of 20 at Reynolda is still disputed to this day as murder or suicide. The Z. Smith Reynolds Foundation to this day gives away millions annually in the Piedmont Triad region. Babcock and her husband Charles also donated land and funds to start a country club from the grounds of Reynolda in 1939, allowing members to sign up for $1 a year while she was alive. An area of of the grounds of the Reynolda estate was donated to Wake Forest University, which then relocated from Wake Forest, North Carolina to Winston-Salem in 1956 and was given $350,000 annually from the Z. Smith Reynolds Foundation in exchange for the move. The Reynolds family is honored through many names on the Wake Forest campus, including Reynolda Hall, the university's library, the Z. Smith Reynolds Library, William Neal Reynolds Gymnasium, along with a dormitory named for Mary Reynolds Babcock. Her husband, Charles Babcock, is honored by Wake Forest through the Charles Babcock School of Business Administration. The school was begun through $500,000 each in gifts from the Z. Smith Reynolds Foundation and Nancy Susan Reynolds. Winston-Salem's airport, the Smith Reynolds Airport, is named for Zachary Smith Reynolds. Reynolds' older son Dick also donated acres of land and funds to the county for the establishment of a golf course and public park in 1939, called Reynolds Park. Its opening in 1940 marked the first time that the Winston-Salem public had access to swimming pools, tennis courts, and a golf course‚Äîpreviously, one had to be a member of a private club to use these types of facilities. Almost a century after her father founded the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, Nancy Susan Reynolds Bagley Verney, his youngest daughter and last surviving child, decided to give back to the region of her father's boyhood. In 1969, she deeded Virginia Tech of Rock Spring Plantation. In 1980, she deeded them another , where Reynolds' childhood home and a continuing education center stand. She created an endowment of $1.7 million to provide cultural programming to the surrounding community, to run a forestry research center on the site, and to fund a scholarship program for Patrick County high school students. She financed this in part by selling her Quarry Farm, designed by architect Frank Forster, in Greenwich, Connecticut, to actor Frank Gorshin in 1977 for $650,000 He would later sell it in 1980 to Diana Ross formerly of the Supremes. She also headed the effort to turn the Virginia farmstead where her father was raised into a historic site. Now called the Reynolds Homestead, it is a State and National Historic Landmark listed in the National Register of Historic Places. As a Continuing Education Center of Virginia Tech, it offers a variety of programs and classes for all ages, all open to the public and many for free. It is open for tours, April through October, Monday through Saturday. The house was restored in 1970. Descendants of Hardin and Nancy Reynolds brought together many original heirlooms, including the bed their 16 children were born in. Only eight of their children lived to adulthood. The Homestead includes the historic house, grounds, two cemeteries, and as was the custom of that time a separate three-story brick kitchen, a brick milk house, a spring house, and a log granary. =Family's companies= Descendants of Hardin William Reynolds have influenced the economic and cultural growth of the U.S., particularly in the South, through their business successes and philanthropy. In 1919, his nephew, Richard S. Reynolds Sr., founded the U.S. Foil Company in Louisville, Kentucky, supplying tin-lead wrappers to cigarette and candy companies. In 1924, he bought the maker of Eskimo Pies (which were foil-wrapped) and four years later he purchased Robertshaw Thermostat, Fulton Sylphon, and part of Beechnut Foil, adding the companies to U.S. Foil to form Reynolds Metals. After realizing the limitations of the tin and lead used in his company's products, in 1926 he added aluminum to the line. The company began using aluminum foil as a packaging material in 1926, and in 1947 they introduced Reynolds Wrap. Sold worldwide, it transformed food storage. Reynolds Metals was the second-largest aluminum company in the United States and the third-largest in the world. The Richmond, Virginia-based company was acquired by Alcoa in 2000.

Gunn's early theoretical work in astronomy has helped establish the current understanding of how galaxies form, and the properties of the space between galaxies. He also suggested important observational tests to confirm the presence of dark matter in galaxies, and predicted the existence of a Gunn‚ÄìPeterson trough in the spectra of distant quasars. Much of Gunn's later work has involved leadership in major observational projects. He developed plans for one of the first uses of digital camera technology for space observation, a project that led to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the most extensive three-dimensional mapping of the universe ever undertaken. He also played a major role with the Wide Field and Planetary Camera on the Hubble Space Telescope. Gunn graduated from A.C. Jones High School in Beeville, Texas in 1957. He earned his bachelor's degree at Rice University in Houston, Texas, in 1961, and his Ph.D. from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in 1965. He joined the faculty of Princeton University two years later. Subsequently, he worked at the University of California at Berkeley and Caltech before returning to Princeton. He is married to the astronomer Gillian Knapp and they have two children, Humberto and Marleny Gunn.

His bionic arm, a prototype developed by the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, differs from most other prostheses, in that it does not use pull cables or nub switches to function and instead uses micro-computers to perform a much wider range of complex motions. It is also the first prototype which enables him to actually sense pressure. History As an electrician, Jesse Sullivan accidentally touched an active cable that contained 7,000-7,500 volts of electricity. In May 2001, he had to have both his arms amputated at the shoulder. Seven weeks after the amputation, Jesse Sullivan received matching bionic prostheses from Dr. Todd Kuiken of the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago. Originally, they were operated from neural signals at the amputation sites, but Jesse Sullivan developed hyper- sensitivity from his skin grafts, causing great discomfort in those areas. Jesse Sullivan underwent neural surgery to graft nerves, which originally led to his arm, to his chest. The sensors for his bionic arms have been moved to the left side of his chest to receive signals from the newly grafted nerve endings. While the prototype is being strengthened, Jesse Sullivan does day- to-day tasks using an older model.

During the 1920s, she wrote for a number of left-wing magazines including The Masses, The Liberator, and the Federated Press. Her short story \\"A Death in the Family\\" appeared on Night Gallery's second season appearing in Episode Two segment One with Desi Arnez Jr. Biography Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. DeFord studied at Wellesley College and Temple University. She later studied at the University of Pennsylvania.Eric Leif Davin, Partners in Wonder: Women and the Birth of Science Fiction, 1926-1965. Lexington Books, Lanham, MD 2006 , (pp. 130. 378-379). DeFord worked as a newspaper reporter for a time. DeFord later described herself as a \\"born feminist\\"; she became active in the Women's suffrage movement before 1920, and was also a campaigner and disseminator of birth control information to women. DeFord was a member of the Socialist Party of America from 1919 to 1922. Her feminist work is documented in From Parlor to Prison: Five American Suffragists Talk About Their Lives, edited by Sherna B. Gluck. During the 1930s, deFord joined the Federal Writers' Project and wrote the book They Were San Franciscans for the Project.Katherine H. Adams, Michael L. Keene Women, Art and the New Deal. McFarland; Jefferson, NC. 2015 (p.39) Interviewed for the League of American Writers pamphlet Writers Take Sides about the Spanish Civil War, DeFord expressed strong support for the Spanish Republic. DeFord added \\"I am unalterably and actively opposed to fascism, Nazism, Hitlerism, Hirohitoism, or whatever name may be applied to the monster\\".Writers take sides: letters about the war in Spain from 418 American authors. League of American writers, New York, 1938. (p.18-9). She spent perhaps the most energy in mystery fiction and science fiction. Hence she did several anthologies in mystery and crime writing. In 1968, she wrote The Real Bonnie and Clyde. She also wrote The Overbury Affair, which involves events during the reign of James I of Britain surrounding the murder of Sir Thomas Overbury. For the latter work she received a 1961 Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for Best Fact Crime book. She worked for Humanist magazine and she was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto. However, in 1949, The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction began with Anthony Boucher as editor. Anthony Boucher wrote science fiction and fantasy but also garnered attention in the mystery field as well. This gave his magazine some cross-over appeal to mystery writers like Ms. deFord. Hence much of her science fiction first appeared in Boucher's magazine. Her stories there dealt with themes like nuclear devastation, alienation, and changing sexual roles. Her two collections are Elsewhere, Elsewhen, Elsehow and Xenogenesis. She also edited an anthology of stories mixing science fiction with mystery called Space, Time, and Crime. DeFord was also a passionate Fortean, a follower of Charles Fort, and did fieldwork for him. DeFord is mentioned in Fort's book Lo! Shortly before her death in 1975, Fortean writer Loren Coleman visited Ms. deFord frequently and interviewed her about her earlier interactions with Fort and her trips to Chico, California, to investigate the case of a poltergeist rock-thrower on Fort's behalf. DeFord died February 22, 1975, aged 86, at her longtime home, the Ambassador Hotel at 55 Mason Street in San Francisco. In 2008, The Library of America selected deFord's story of the Leopold and Loeb trial for inclusion in its two-century retrospective of American True Crime. Personal Life DeFord's first marriage was to Armistead Collier in 1915. The couple divorced in 1920. She was married to Maynard Shipley from 1921 until his death in June 1934.Dangerous Visions, page 115.

Robinson, Dorothy Provine, and Michael Connors. It was based on the novel by Jack Finney. The screenplay was the motion picture debut of James Fritzell and Everett Greenbaum, who had written many American television situation comedies including The Andy Griffith Show and Mister Peepers (created by David Swift). Greenbaum also created the mobile sculpture featured in the film. Plot Lemmon plays Sam Bissell, a hard-working San Francisco advertising executive, with two young daughters and a loving wife, Min (Dorothy Provine). An extremely important client, Simon Nurdlinger (Edward G. Robinson), is considering taking his business elsewhere when he believes there are no \\"family men\\" working at Sam's company. Sam's boss, Mr. Burke (Edward Andrews), introduces the client to Sam. The client is delighted by Sam and agrees to do business with him and the company. Sam feels his career is now on the way up and he goes home to celebrate with his wife. There, he meets his wife's longtime friend and their new next-door neighbor, Janet (Romy Schneider), and they all have dinner together to celebrate his promotion and Janet's new home. Sam gets drunk and tumbles down the grand carpeted staircase of the Fairmont Hotel, knocking down a waiter carrying trays of meals. Janet, a beautiful woman, is recently divorced from her husband Howard (Michael Connors) and is happier than ever. She has also come into a large inheritance from her grandfather, which carries the stipulation that she must still be married to Howard in order to receive the inheritance. State law dictates that a divorce is not final until a year from final settlement. Since only six months have passed, Janet decides to hide the divorce from her cousins Irene (Anne Seymour) and Jack (Charles Lane) who stand to inherit if Janet is disqualified. With Howard unavailable, Sam is pressed to impersonate him when Irene and Jack arrive for a visit. Having never met Howard, Irene and Jack seem convinced but begin watching the couple with a telescopic surveillance camera hidden in a phony workmen's truck nearby. Janet and Sam (with Min's complicity) are thereby forced to continue the charade for several days, with Sam cohabiting and being driven to work by Janet, and sneaking in to occasionally visit Min through the back yard, or hidden in a laundry basket. When caught pretending by Mr. Burke and Mr. Nurdlinger, Sam and Janet are then forced into a double charade in which Janet pretends to be Min. The situation begins to unravel when Irene and Jack hire a private investigator to keep watch on Sam and Janet, and Howard re-enters the picture. Sam panics after noticing new advertising billboards around the city showing his face with Janet's, and so paints clown faces on them late the last night before the attorney is to give Howard and Janet their inheritance.

Windows Media and Flash) * Live webcam video * \\"Panoramic video\\" with Microsoft RoundTable * Multi-party two-way VoIP audio * PSTN and VoIP audio integration * Active speaker indicator * Public events page * Advanced testing and grading * High fidelity recordings * Personal recordings * Virtual Breakout Rooms * \\"Handout\\" distribution (file transfer) Live Meeting Web Access (MWA) was redesigned in this release to provide a user experience nearly identical to the new Windows-based Live Meeting client. One benefit was that Live Meeting Web Access was a Java applet and therefore ran on non- Windows operating systems such as Linux, Solaris, and MacOS. The Live Meeting product was also intended to operate with the Polycom CX5000 (formerly known as the Microsoft RoundTable), a 360 degree video camera optimized to work with Microsoft Office Live Meeting 2007. One new feature included in this version allowed the Microsoft Office Live Meeting client to automatically switch the larger video window to the actively speaking participant. This auto-switch feature was not specific to the Polycom CX5000 product - it worked with any USB-based camera. The main advantage of the CX5000 was its 360 degree camera view, suitable for conference rooms with several participants. With specially designed microphones, the CX5000 was able to determine the location of the active speaker and then tell Microsoft Office Live Meeting which camera angle to focus on. History Live Meeting was originally a separate company called PlaceWare. Microsoft acquired PlaceWare to improve upon NetMeeting, its own webconferencing technology. Microsoft subsequently dropped development of NetMeeting.

Early tours featured Smokey Robinson & The Miracles, Mary Wells, The Marvelettes, Barrett Strong, and The Contours as headlining acts, and gave then-second-tier acts such as Marvin Gaye, Martha & The Vandellas, Stevie Wonder, The Supremes, The Four Tops, Gladys Knight & the Pips and The Temptations the chances to improve their skills. History Motown's entire roster, and occasionally non-Motown performers such as James Brown, Otis Redding, Aretha Franklin, Dusty Springfield, The Shirelles and Patti LaBelle & the Bluebelles, were featured on the tours. Most of the venues for the early Motortown Revue tours were along the \\"Chitlin' Circuit\\" in the eastern and southern United States. In the Deep South racism became an issue, as the mostly African American performers were sometimes attacked or threatened by local white residents. While in the north the Motown artists generally played to mixed audiences, in the South, white and black audiences either attended separate shows, or were allowed to attend the same show as long as each race stayed on either side of a police-guarded rope that divided the performance hall. Motown artists are credited with being among those who broke down these barriers so later audiences would no longer be separated by color. It was from a live Motortown Revue performance that Little Stevie Wonder got his first big hit, the 1963 #1 hit \\"Fingertips (Pt. 2)\\". Motown CEO Berry Gordy, Jr. noted in his biography, To Be Loved, that the Revue was used to showcase Stevie Wonder in the days before he had his first hit. Also, Smokey Robinson and the other Miracles composed songs such as \\"The Way You Do the Things You Do\\" and \\"My Girl\\" while on the road, which later became hits for The Temptations. The Miracles, Motown's first star act (and first million- selling group), always closed the show. After becoming a major force in the music industry during the mid-1960s, Motown continued to organize group tours under the Motortown Revue name. Later tours from the mid-1960s on covered the entire United States, and other countries including the UK and France. The revue was filmed during a December 1962 week-long stand at the Apollo Theater, and in 1963 Motown released audio edits from the films as a series of live LPs. The films themselves have never had an authorized exhibition other than occasional brief snippets in a Motown TV special. A four-CD box set compiling the four issued albums of Motortown Revue live performances was released by Motown/Hip-O select in 2002, celebrating the Revue's 40th anniversary. Motortown Revue: 40th Anniversary Collection collected the various artists Motown releases Motortown Revue, Vol. 1 Recorded Live at the Apollo (1963), Motortown Revue Vol. 2 (recorded at Detroit's Fox Theatre in 1964), Motortown Revue in Paris (recorded at the Olympia Theatre in 1965), and Motortown Revue Live!

When Australian cricket was in the doldrums in the 1980s \\"his dashing batsmanship and growing ability as a spin bowler suddenly elevated Matthews to a position of a national hero\\".p28, Garry Linnell, Benson and Hedges Tests Series Official Book 1986‚Äì87 The Clashes for the Ashes, Playbill Sport Publication, 1986 He made centuries in times of crisis against New Zealand and India in 1985‚Äì86, took ten wickets in the Tied Test at Madras and batted well against England in 1986‚Äì87. Thereafter his career declined as the \\"effervescent and unorthodox\\" Matthews did not fit in with the rest of the Australian Test team. As Australia rose to dominance in the 1990s Matthews proved to be \\"not good enough in either of the game's main departments to make a lasting impact as a Test all-rounder\\"p52, Christopher Martin-Jenkins, Cricket Characters, Stanley Paul and Co Ltd, 1987 and despite a century against England in 1990‚Äì91 he played only irregularly and was finally dropped in 1993. He continued to play with success for New South Wales until he retired in 1997. Early life During his youth Matthews attended Ermington Public SchoolAnna (class 4S), Ermington Public School History , Ermington Public School Website (accessed 19 June 2006) and played for the Rydalmere Cricket Club, where he won the Under 11s Northern Districts Cricket Association Cricketer of the Year Award in 1970‚Äì71 and 1971‚Äì72.Wrens History , Rydalmere Cricket Club (accessed 19 June 2006) Coach Gordon Nolan was crucial to his early development. Prior to his cricket career taking off, Matthews played Colts (under 20s) Rugby for the Eastwood Rugby Club and was a pro for the Cumbrian side Whitehaven Cricket Club for three seasons, starring in the club's 1981 league championship victory. At the conclusion of a successful season for Eastwood there was speculation that cricket may be put aside for Rugby, but he opted to play cricket. =1982/83: State Selection= Matthews made his first-class debut over the 1982‚Äì83 summer. Scoring 123 and taking 3‚Äì48 for the state colts against Queensland saw him selected in the New South Wales side to play Western Australia in November 1982, replacing John Dyson, who was on test duty. He took 3‚Äì41 for NSW in a day-night game against a touring New Zealand side. Some enterprising runs from Matthews in a game against Queensland helped NSW get in the Sheffield Shield final. Matthews played in the final, won by NSW‚Äîtheir first Sheffield Shield in 17 years. He spent the 1983 winter playing club cricket in England. =1983/84: National Selection= Matthews was made 12th man for NSW's first game of the 1983‚Äì84 season‚Äîa delayed McDonald's Cup one day final. However, poor bowling by Murray Bennett in that game saw Matthews take Bennett's place. He took three wickets in a shield game against WA, then scored 86 with 13 boundaries against the touring Pakistan side. He injured his hand while fielding in a game against Victoria. However, Matthews was then picked to play in the Australian team against Pakistan. He was chosen along with state teammate Murray Bennett. Matthews had recently applied to go on the dole but was ruled out on a technicality when it was discovered that he was playing in a McDonald's Cup match that week. \\"I don't care what money I get, man\\", Matthews said. \\"It's the buzz of playing for Australia that's got me. I'm not worried about how much they pay ... I'd do it all for nothing just to wear that green cap.\\" However, there was some sad news for Matthews. \\"My old coach from the Rydalmere junior days, Gordon Nolan, is dead and I owe so much to him that I wish I could have contacted him this morning as both our dreams came true.\\" Matthews was also picked to play in the Prime Ministers XI. Early Test Career > Matthews is a tough, useful, determined little cricketer; a steady, flat, > off-spin bowler; a staunch, correct left-hand bat; and a brilliant fielder. > He is also a cocky, slightly zany character. :Christopher Martin-Jenkins Early in his cricketing career Matthews was regarded \\"as a bowler who fielded energetically and could bat a bit\\"p176, Allan Border, An Autobiography, Meuthen Australia pty Ltd, 1986 and a \\"complete extrovert, dressing to shock\\".p40, Steve Waugh, Out of My Comfort Zone, Michel Joseph, 2006 He was usually referred to as Greg, but his teammates nicknamed him 'Mo', \\"short for 'mis√®re', which he always called when we played five hundred\\". Matthews enjoyed clubbing and ignored the midnight curfew imposed by New South Wales fast bowler Geoff Lawson as \\"these were his socialising hours and the time he came to life\\",p57, Steve Waugh Out of My Comfort Zone, Michel Joseph, 2006 and his mantra was \\"'live each day as if it's your last'\\".p57, Steve Waugh, Out of My Comfort Zone, Michel Joseph, 2006 Matthews took 2/95 and 2/48 in his first test match, running out Zaheer Abbas in the first innings and bowling him in the second. With the bat he made 75, joining Graham Yallop (268) on 354/7 and adding 185 together for the eighth wicket. Australian captain Kim Hughes said he \\"thought that Matthews's innings was a remarkable performance as he is fiercely competitive which is typically Australian. His batting was great and his overall performance was outstanding.\\" However, there was controversy when Matthews was dismissed; he was given out lbw by umpire Tony Crafter and when he walked off he indicated that he thought the ball had come off his bat. (Matthews later apologised to the umpire for the very public display of dissent.) The Test was drawn and Matthews was kept for the Fifth Test, preferred to Murray Bennett as the spinner. He was Greg Chappell's batting partner when he was dismissed for 182 in his final Test innings. Chappell later said Matthews was the strangest cricketer he ever played with. \\"He came from a different background, spoke a different language, a surfie's language\\", recalled Chappell. \\"'Bro', 'cool' being a major part of his language. He didn't meet the stereotype of what an Australian cricketer looked like, spoke like, sounded like. And yet he had a love of the game that was as strong as anyone I ever played with or against.\\" Matthews' performance in the tests impressed captain Kim Hughes. \\"He's very competitive, wants to bowl and bat\\", Hughes said. \\"If we had 12 players with the same approach it would be great.\\" Matthews was picked to play in Australia's one day team for the World Series Cricket competition that summer and was praised for his fielding, but failed to perform with the bat and ball and was dropped after two games. Matthews responded with a good performance against Tasmania in the Sheffield Shield. =1983/84 Tour of West Indies= Mathews was selected as one of two spinners on the 1983‚Äì84 tour to the West Indies. He played in two early tour games but was out-bowled by the other spinner Tom Hogan who was preferred in the first four tests. Matthews bowled well against Barbados and scored 54 against Windward Islands as an opener. Australia lost the third and fourth tests. Matthews was picked in the fifth test. He was a makeshift opener in the second innings as Steve Smith was injured. Kim Hughes seemed reluctant to use Matthews as a bowler in a game which Australia lost. Matthews was omitted from the one day squad to tour India in 1984 and he was not offered a contract from the ACB for the following summer. =1984/85 Summer= Matthews was unable to force his way back into a test team for the first three tests against the West Indies. But 88 against Queensland helped see him selected in the side for the 4th test. Matthews dismissed Viv Richards (208) and Clive Lloyd (91) with his 2/67 in a draw that ended their 11 match winning streak. He was not one of the three spinners chosen for the Fifth Test on his home ground at Sydney where Australia won by an innings. However, Matthews finished the summer strongly in the Sheffield Shield. He scored 87 and took 5‚Äì32 against Queensland, then scored his maiden century, 103 against Victoria. When asked about a possible return to the Australian side, Matthews said, \\"I think as little as possible about it. I used to lie awake thinking about it a lot but I don't want the disappointment of not going and besides, NSW has a lot to do.\\" Matthews was told he was recalled to the Australian side to tour Sharjah for a one-day tournament, then took part in the Sheffield Shield final, where NSW beat Qld by one wicket. He capped off the season with news he had been picked in the squad to tour England for the 1985 Ashes. \\"I just didn't think I would make it\\", said a delighted Matthews. =1985 Sharjah Tour= Matthews toured Sharjah with the Australian one day team. =1985 Ashes= Matthews then went to England in 1985, where he proved popular in the county matches. Australia seemed determined to play an all rounder and Matthews was in competition with Simon O'Donnell. In the One Day Internationals Matthews batted at number eight and hit the winning runs at Old Trafford (22 not out) and Lord's (29 not out) as Australia won the Texaco Trophy 2‚Äì1. In the Third Test at Trent Bridge he mixed with the crowd and read a newspaper in the stands; \\"Matthews of the petit-punk hair and puppet movements...has a happy knack of winding up crowds\\".p61, Alan Ross/ Patrick Eagar, An Australian Summer, The Kingswood Press, 1985, Matthews produced some solid batting performances in the county games. He was selected in the Fourth Test because Graeme Wood was injured and again volunteered to open the innings,pp32-33, Rod Nicolson, Benson and Hedges Tests Series Official Book 1986‚Äì87 The Clashes for the Ashes, Playbill Sport Publication, 1986 but also ran out Allan Lamb from extra cover.p113, Michael Milford, Daily Telegraph Cricket Year Book 86, Telegraph Publications, 1985 At the end of the tour Matthews had now played in five Test matches, but had only made 139 runs (19.85) and taken 7 wickets (45.28) and was far from establishing his place in the Australia team. Alan Border said \\"Greg never really came on as much as we expected. But he's still young and has time on his side.\\" Breakthrough as International Cricketer: Australia vs New Zealand 1985‚Äì86 Greg Matthews' Test career batting performance. Greg Matthews joined me at the wicket to start an innings which was to 'make' him as a Test cricketer...I think we had all regarded him as a bowler who fielded energetically and could bat a bit. We'd misjudged him, and that century put the true all-rounder stamp on him. :Allan Border Matthews started the 1985‚Äì86 summer well with 184 against Tasmania. He then took 5‚Äì22 against Victoria. \\"I'm a little older now, I'm more hungry for success and have a little more experience on my side in how I conduct myself\\", he said. Matthews was picked to play the First Test against New Zealand at the Woolloongabba. The selection choice came down to Matthews and Simon O'Donnell‚ÄîMatthews was picked, with O'Donnell 12th man. This test saw Australia lose their third Test in a row by an innings as Richard Hadlee took 15/123. Matthews was Australian's best bowler (3/110) and joined the Australian captain Allan Border at 67/5 in the second innings with 307 runs required to make New Zealand bat again. He made his first Test century‚Äî115 off 229 balls with 10 fours and a six‚Äîand most of the 197 runs added with Border (152), a record sixth wicket stand for Australia against New Zealand.p57, Michael Milford, Daily Telegraph Cricket Year Book 87, Telegraph Publications, 1986 \\"I was really disappointed at get ting out\\", he said. \\"I felt as if I'd let the team down with just four overs to go and I'd wanted to see it through. Allan and I were confident we could play through tomorrow. We certainly felt that we could save the game.\\" This was backed up with 111 for NSW against New Zealand then 50 and 32 in the Second Test at Sydney, which Australia won by 4 wickets. In the third test he scored 34 and 14 as Australia lost. He was second in the Australian series batting averages after the captain with 247 runs (41.16). Alan Border was greatly pleased with Matthews performances that summer saying \\"Once he didn't feel part of the team, he fell he was a different sort of a character and others reacted that way to him. Now he feels accepted ‚Äì his idiosyncrasies are not him being smart, we have found, and he now feels part of us.\\" Australia vs India 1985‚Äì86 New Zealand was only the third country to beat Australia at home after England and the West Indies and India looked set to become the fourth. They made scores of 520, 445, 59/2 and 600/4 in the Tests and Matthews suffered with the other Australian bowlers, taking only two wickets (118.00) in the series. In the Second Test at Melbourne he came in at 109/5 and made 100 not out adding 46 for the last wicket with his New South Wales teammate Dave Gilbert (4)‚Äîwho came in when Matthews was 59‚Äîto hoist the Australian total up to 262. Lacklustre Indian batting and late rain saved the match after Allan Border (163) and Gilbert (10 not out) made another rear-guard action in the second innings. Though they outplayed Australia in all three Tests this was the nearest India came to winning a Test and the series. Benson and Hedges World Series Cup 1985‚Äì86 After the two Test series there was a triangular World Series Cup One Day series between Australia, New Zealand and India, who were the current World Champions, and Australia and India made it into the best out of three finals. Matthews was part of the Australian squad throughout the summer. Matthews played a key role in several Australian victories including 46 in a game against India and 1‚Äì27 against New Zealand. In the First WSC Final Matthews was run out for 7 in Australia's 170/8, but returned an economical 9‚Äì0‚Äì27‚Äì3 to bowl out India for 159 to win by 11 runs. \\"Matthews is a confidence player, never says die and has developed tremendously as a player\\", Border said after the game. \\"I ask special players their opinions as the game progresses, but would never have thought of confiding in Matthews a short time ago.\\" In the Second WSC Final he took 10‚Äì0‚Äì37‚Äì2 to restrict India to 187 and saw Australia win the game by 7 wickets and the Finals 2‚Äì0 without the need for a third game. Matthews was voted Player of the Finalsp82, Michael Melford, The Daily Telegraph Cricket Year Book 87, Telegraph Publications, 1986 and it was a considerable boost to Australian confidence as the team completed a lap of honour round the Melbourne Cricket Ground.pp189-190, Allan Border, An Autobiography, Meuthen Australia Pty Ltd, 1986 Matthews was selected on Australia's tours of New Zealand and Sharjah. For the latter he was to be one of Australia's selectors, a sign of how integral he had become. \\"National selector ‚Äì that's a big wrap, man\\", he said at the time. \\"It's a bit of added responsibility and I hope that I can handle it. I'm really happy that the people who are virtually my employers think I can handle the extra responsibility that goes with being a selector.\\" New Zealand vs Australia 1985‚Äì86 > I could never analyse why, right from the outset, sections of the New > Zealand crowds had taken a set against Greg. Perhaps it was his jaunty > manner on the field. Perhaps he was a shade too successful for the liking of > the more rabidly parochial Kiwi fans...You could never understand the > mentality behind the crank phone calls Greg received in New Zealand, the > egg-throwing and the incident in Wellington where a toilet seat was thrown > on the field. :Allan Borderp200, Allan Border, An Autobiography, Meuthen > Australia Pty Ltd, 1986 Australia toured New Zealand in 1985‚Äì86 and lost their second series against them in the same season despite several improvements. When they arrived Matthews said \\"Greg Matthews had a fantastic summer. He kept things going in the field, never said die and was full of enthusiasm. He certainly helped me: he has been a big plus for Australia.\\" Matthews began the tour well with 57 in a tour game. He was still nursing a shoulder injury from the WSC series but was picked in the first test team. \\"He is just too important to leave out\\", said Border. In the First Test, Matthews (130) came in at 166/4 and added 213 for the fifth wicket with Greg Ritchie (92), a record for Australia vs New Zealand and Matthews' highest Test score. Matthews had eggs pelted at him during his innings. Rain ensured a draw in both the first two Tests and in the Second Matthews had the unusual bowling analysis of 3‚Äì3‚Äì0‚Äì1 when he caught and bowled Bruce Edgar in New Zealand's second innings of 16/1. Matthews scored 66 in a one-day game in Napier. Australia lost the Third Test when they collapsed to 103 in the second innings and lost by 8 wickets. Matthews had taken his then best Test bowling of 4/61, dismissing Bruce Edgar (24), Ken Rutherford (0) and Martin Crowe (0) with the score on 73. This gave him 8 wickets (29.50), his best series bowling so far, but he had taken only 23 wickets (43.69) in 14 Tests to add to his 725 runs (32.95). The Australian captain Allan Border threatened to resign if Australia did not win the four game One Day International series and then saw New Zealand go 2‚Äì0 up.pp196-198, Allan Border, An Autobiography, Meuthen Australia Pty Ltd, 1986 Fortunately Australia won the last two games and Matthews was Man of the Match in the Fourth ODI at Eden Park, where he made 54, took 9‚Äì1‚Äì33‚Äì3 and held onto three catches in Australia's 44-run win. This allowed Border to announce that the team had improved enough for him not to resign, much to the advantage of Australian cricket.p201, Allan Border, An Autobiography, Meuthen Australia Pty Ltd, 1986 Throughout the series, Matthews was constantly booed by the crowd. \\"I suppose I am paying the price for my style of individuality after they watched me on TV in the series at home\\", he said. \\"He gives everything, he is flamboyant but not a ratbag\\", said Border. \\"I know Matthews is disappointed‚Äîhe hasn't enjoyed the tour, he has been given a hard time by some elements here. He likes meeting people but has been prevented from mingling socially.\\" \\"If he finds the crowd harsh here then he must remember he asked for it.\\" said Jeremy Coney. \\"But crowds just can't be neutral about him\\", he said. Some applaud his behaviour and others didn't. His behaviour polarises the crowds here and he must expect some sort of reaction from those who don't like it. I just feel neutral about him‚Äîwhen he is batting I want to get rid of him, when he is bowling I want to hit him around the park.\\" =1986 Sharjah Tour= Matthews position in the side was confirmed when he took part in the short one day tournament in Sharjah. Matthews was the third selector. There was more good news for Matthews when he returned home: he won NSW Cricketer of the Year. India vs Australia 1986‚Äì87 and The Second Tied Test > There were many heros throughout the exhausting five days of play, but with > a doubt, the most unsung of them was Greg Matthews, who scored 44 and 27 not > out and took five wickets in each innings. His stamina and resilience were > absolutely staggering, especially on the last day, when he bowled 39.5 overs > just about consecutively to keep us in the game and then ultimately tie it. > Making his feat all the more noteworthy in the eyes of his fellow players > was the fact that he wore two sleeveless sweaters throughout the day. > Actually, he gave one to the umpire when he fielded and only wore them both > when he was bowling. We just shook our heads in disbelief, because it was so > hot with 90-degree humidity, but as usual Greg had a theory. He explained > that nomadic herders in the desert wore woollen coats because they kept the > cool air in, thus acting as a kind of air-conditioner. :Steve Waugh.p105, > Steve Waugh, Out of My Comfort Zone, Michel Joseph, 2006 Australia toured India at the start of the 1986‚Äì87 season. He and Ray Bright were the only spinners. Matthews had an excellent tour. He took five wickets in the first tour game, and made 99 against Bombay. He played the First Test at Madras, a huge concrete bowl which radiated the intense heat, which rose to 50 ¬∞C with 90% humidity.p104-105, Steve Waugh, Out of My Comfort Zone, Michel Joseph, 2006 Allan Border won the toss and Australia declared on 574/7 on the third day when Matthews was out for 44. In the Indian innings he took 5/103, his first five-wicket haul in Test cricket and best Test figures, as he dismissed Sunil Gavaskar (caught and bowled), Krishnamachari Srikkanth, Ravi Shastri, Chandrakant Pandit and Kapil Dev as India were bowled out for 397. Australia batted again and Matthews made 27 not out in Australia's 170/5, which set India 348 runs to win on the last day. Matthews dismissed Srikkanth, Mohinder Amarnath and Pandit as India collapsed from 200/2 to 291/6. His 40th over was the last that could be played in the match, bowling to Ravi Shastri, with India's last man Maninder Singh at the bowler's end. India needed four runs to win from the 6-ball over with only one wicket remaining; * 1st ball: To Shastri: no run. Four runs required off five balls. * 2nd ball: Shastri took two runs, retaining the strike. Two runs required off four balls. * 3rd ball: Shastri pushed the ball to square leg for a single. The scores are now tied, with one run required for victory, but the Indian number 11 was now on strike. * 4th ball: To Singh: no run. One run required off two balls. * 5th ball: The ball hit Singh on his back leg and umpire Vikram Raju gives him out leg before wicket after a loud appeal. India were all out for 347, Matthews having taken 5/146 (10/249 in the match) in the second Second Tied Test in cricket history. It was the second and last time that he would take five wickets in a Test innings and the only time that he took ten wickets in a Test match. Dean Jones (210) and Kapil Dev (119) were each selected as a 'man of the match'. Greg Matthews was later made 'all-rounder of the match'.p107, Steve Waugh, Out of My Comfort Zone, Michel Joseph, 2006 Matthews later reflected, \\"It was an incredible relief that we didn't lose because we certainly didn't deserve to. Obviously it was an emotional high that's very hard to express in words. But I wouldn't say it was the high point of my career, simply because we didn't win. The Second Test began with three days of rain and Matthews did not bat or bowl. The Third Test was a draw, Matthews taking 4/158 to dismiss Gavaskar, Srikkanth, Amarnath and Mohammad Azharuddin in India's only innings. He took 14 wickets (29.07) and made 91 runs (45.50) in the series, his most successful with the ball.

Despite high hopes of regaining The Ashes against an England team that \\"can't bat, can't bowl and can't field\\"p51, Frances Edmonds, Cricket XXXX Cricket, The Kingswood Press, 1987 Australia found itself in trouble again. Allan Border won the toss at the Gabba put England in to bat and watched them make 456. Greg Matthews was the most senior of bowlers, and had played as many Tests (17) as the others combined; Bruce Reid (8), Steve Waugh (8), Merv Hughes (1) and Chris Matthews (0). Still, he made a gritty 56 not out in the first innings, but Australia could not avoid the follow-on and lost by 7 wickets. In the Second Test at the WACA England made 592/7 declared and Matthews batted for 190 minutes for his 45 and 14 not out to see out the draw. There was some talk Matthews would become 12th man for the third test but he kept his place. The Third Test at Adelaide finally saw Australia on top, but Border declared their innings on 514/5 with Matthews on 73 not out and Waugh on 79 not out after complaining about their slow scoring rate. In any case England had no trouble drawing the match on a slow, flat wicket, though Matthews did bowl the England captain Mike Gatting for a first ball duck. The Fourth Test at Melbourne was a debacle as the Australian batsmen threw their wickets away to Ian Botham (5/41) and Gladstone Small (5/48) and losing inside three days; Matthews made 14 and 0. Although he had made 217 runs (53.75) Matthews had taken only two wickets (147.50) and could hardly justify his place in the bowling line up. Neil Harvey wrote in a column: > If they [the selectors] ever pick Greg Matthews again the game is not fair. > Matthews shouldn't have been in the side in Adelaide or Melbourne and that > was proved when his captain didn't ask him to bowl a single over last Friday > and Saturday. His appointment in the fourth Test ahead of Greg Ritchie was a > disgraceful selection. He's got to be dropped from the Sydney Test. He only played one game in the Benson and Hedges One Day Challenge. With The Ashes out of reach the selectors dropped David Boon and Craig McDermott for the Fifth Test, and made Matthews 12th man. The test was won thanks to the debutant spinner Peter Taylor and Peter Sleep. Matthews did keep his place in the Australian one day squad. Highlights of the summer included 3‚Äì32 against the West Indies, 2‚Äì24 against England and 3‚Äì27 against England. Alan Border made a point of praising Matthews for his bowling in the one day matches at the end of the summer. This ensured Matthew's selection on another short tour to Sharjah to play one day games against India, England and Pakistan. He and Peter Taylor would be the spinners. Matthews ended the Australian summer with a century for NSW against Victoria. Around this time Matthews revealed he turned down two approaches to tour South Africa despite being offered $200,000 because \\"I didn't think $200,000 would make me happy and I had other things in life to do.\\" He defended his former teammates who had decided to go and opposed the sporting boycott: > When I'm in Sharjah (United Arab Emirates), I don't put up my hand and say, > 'Well, why aren't you girls allowed to walk around like Western > Europeans'‚Äîbecause that's the way it is in their country. I'm sure a lot of > women there don't like it but I don't see people jumping up and down. =1987 Tour to Sharjah= The tour did not go well for Matthews who was fined $1,000 for disciplinary reasons. He was dropped from the squad to go to India and Pakistan for the 1987 World Cup in favour of Tim May, in what was described as \\"a shock omission\\". It was later revealed Matthews had an off- field argument over a barbecued steak in Sharjah and was fined $1,000 by Ian McDonald and Bobby Simpson. Steve Waugh thought he \\"was being punished largely for previous infractions and perceived attitude problems ... and straight away you could sense that a couple of guys felt their careers might be over\\".pp123-124, Steve Waugh, Out of My Comfort Zone, Michel Joseph, 2006 Bobby Simpson was Matthews' personal manager and the Australian coach and though he had been supportive in his early career, but now wanted a more disciplined team and Matthews did not fit in.pp123-126, Steve Waugh, Out of My Comfort Zone, Michel Joseph, 2006 Instead of playing in the World Cup, Matthews went to Zimbabwe with New South Wales. He then represented Australia in the World All-Rounders Cricket Championship. Test Exile:1987‚Äì1990 > He wasn't fitting in with the team.

Despite his 10-wicket haul in the Tied Test his bowling was not of Test standard and his batting average 36.82 was not enough to keep him in the team by itself when David Boon, Allan Border, Dean Jones and Steve Waugh were occupying the middle order. =1987‚Äì88= Matthews performed strongly for New South Wales over the 1987‚Äì88 season, including a career best 6‚Äì97 with the ball against Victoria. However, Australian selectors preferred Peter Taylor, Tim May and Peter Sleep for their spin options. Matthews was selected in the Prime Ministers XI to play the touring New Zealand side. =1988‚Äì89: One Day Recall= Matthews began the 1988‚Äì89 domestic summer strongly and there was some talk he would be able to get back in the test team. He was recalled to the Australian one day team for the WSC finals series in 1988‚Äì89, as a third spinner. However, he bowled poorly, going for 0‚Äì62 off 7 overs. \\"I felt sorry for him in a lot of ways\\", said Alan Border, \\"because I gave him a pretty tough task, bowling in that first 15 overs, and then he had to bowl towards the end when their guys were wacking out.\\" Matthews was overlooked for the 1989 Ashes in favor of Tim May and Trevor Hohns. However, when May fell injured, Matthews was picked in an Australian one day squad to tour India. \\"I am just glad to be part of the scene again\\", he said. \\"I'm stoked.\\" =1989‚Äì90= Matthews struggled in the early part of the 1989‚Äì90 season and was made 12th man for NSW for some games. He eventually worked his way back into the side and had a strong season, highlights including 10‚Äì76 against Tasmania. His excellent bowling in the Sheffield Shield final against Queensland helped New South Wales to victory. \\"It's always nice to take wickets, the seven against Tasmania was a career best and a big turn on, and five in the final is a big turn on also\\", said Matthews. \\"They are all important.\\" Australia vs England 1990‚Äì91: Test recall > He was always excellent for the shock-value element, but also a guy who > could play better than he probably ever realised and who record as an all- > rounder for NSW is unrivalled. :Steve Waugh.p99, Steve Waugh, Out of My > Comfort Zone, Michel Joseph, 2006 Matthews continued to play well for New South Wales, and his 5‚Äì56 against Tasmania was his fourth five-wicket haul in five games. =Test recall= He was picked in an Australian XI to play the touring English in Hobart then was picked in the squad for the first test. Peter Taylor had not proved to be a long-term success and Matthews was the only Australian spinner in the side, apart from Allan Border. There was some talk Matthews would be made 12th man but Border favoured a spinner. \\"I think the best balance is to play a spinner, which means that one of the quickies would have to miss out\\", Border said, adding that he was particularly impressed by Matthews' bowling in the Sheffield Shield final the previous summer. \\"He was a class above any one else I've faced for a long, long time ‚Äì and that's anyone in the world.\\" He made 35 batting at number seven and took 1/30, but Australia won by eight wickets. He was omitted in favour of Peter Taylor for the one day team. However, when Taylor fell injured Matthews was called up in his place and played a number of games. Highlights included 3‚Äì54 against England. He was eventually dropped from the one day team when Taylor got better. Matthews kept his place in the test side. He took 3/40 in the Second Test at Melbourne and 2/26 in the Third Test at Sydney, where he also hit 128 with 17 boundaries to lift Australia from 292/5 to 512/9. He was overlooked for Peter Taylor in Australia's one day side. However, he took six wickets for New South Wales against England. In the Fourth Test at Adelaide he made 65 and 34 not out and 60 not out at Perth in the Fifth. Australia won the series 3‚Äì0 and Matthews made 353 runs (70.60), his best Test series with the bat, though he only took 7 wickets (60.28). This effort earned Matthews selection on the 1991 tour of the West Indies. He was Australia's most successful spin bowler that summer. 1990‚Äì91 West Indies Matthews began the West Indies tour well with 95 not out and 4‚Äì57 against Jamaica. However, he failed to take any wickets in the first test and Alan Border began to think about replacing him with Steve Waugh. \\"If you are going to play a bowler you don't think is going to take any wickets, what's the point?\\" asked Border. \\"You might as well go the other way and play Steve Waugh because he's more likely to get a wicket or two. Greg took seven wickets at home and two or three of them came in the second innings in Sydney, when England was slogging. In the first innings, when we wanted to bowl them out, Greg couldn't. It's been a while since our spinner has really played a part in a Test match.\\" Matthews was picked in the second test but was out-bowled by Alan Border. \\"Greg can be a bit too attacking for his own good\\", Border said. \\"He tends to toss the ball up a bit too much for this sort of wicket. Every time he threw the ball up, it disappeared, either along the ground or over the top. That's why he tends to go for more runs than he should.... Next time he gets into this situation, he should think of just trying to bowl maidens and letting them have a crack. On this sort of wicket, you've got to be firing in your stock ball and to let the batsman come at you a bit more.\\" Since returning to the test team in early November, Matthews had taken nine wickets at more than 76 runs a piece while conceding 690 runs. \\"The way they've treated Greg, you wonder if he's going to get any wickets and maybe it's time to try Peter\\", said Border. Matthews was dropped for the rest of the tests. Steve Waugh played in two and Peter Taylor in the fifth. In addition to this, Matthews encountered embarrassment due to his association with the writer, Roland Fishman. Fishman had written a biography of Matthews in 1986 and accompanied him on the West Indies tour to write a book, Calypso Cricket. The result was highly controversial, speaking about previously-taboo items such as the sex lives of players. \\"I feel devastated\\", said Matthews. \\"He talks about loyalty and friendship to me.\\" Matthews said the author had gone \\"behind his back\\" and had written an exaggerated account: \\"What price loyalty and friend ship? I trusted him because he is a friend of mine. I feel betrayed.\\" 1991‚Äì92 series At the beginning of the 1991‚Äì92 series, Matthews said he thought he and Peter Taylor were the top spinners in Australia. \\"I would like to think I still stand in the top two at worst\\", he said. \\"There was only Peter and myself in Adelaide as far as slow bowlers were concerned and we were the only two that went to the West Indies. Although I did not get a lot of wickets in the series last year, I like to think I contributed with bat and ball. I didn't have a lot of opportunities in the West Indies, which was a bummer. With the start of the new season, that's all gone. We are probably both on level terms and I guess whoever performs the best will be given the first opportunity.\\" Matthews scored some useful runs in the FAI Cup Final, with NSW beating WA. He was fined $5,000 for excessive appealing during a Shield game against WA. Matthews scored 139 against Victoria, one of his best ever innings with the bat. He took four wickets in the same game. NSW coach Steve Rixon said Matthews \\"is the pick of the bunch at the moment ... he is the main man as far as spin bowlers go.\\" However, the selectors preferred Peter Taylor and Shane Warne for the tests. Matthews domestic form was excellent. In one game against Queensland he made 85 not out and 67 not out and took 6‚Äì63 and 5‚Äì70, making him only the seventh player to take more than ten wickets and score more than 100 runs in a Shield game. He was included in the initial 20-man squad for the 1992 World Cup. He took 5‚Äì61 against South Australia, 6‚Äì89 against Tasmania, and ten wickets against WA. \\"Greg's spin bowling has been outstanding this season\\", said NSW captain Geoff Lawson. \\"Greg hasn't had that many bats so his 500-odd runs could easily have been 700 in the season. It is a surprise that he hasn't played for Australia because he has clearly been the best all-rounder around and his catching has been superb as well.\\" He was the first Australian player that century to score over 500 runs and take more than 50 wickets in one Sheffield Shield season. These efforts saw him voted NSW Cricketer of the year and earned him selection on the 13-man Australian squad to tour Sri Lanka in 1992. \\"I have always believed I have been a good ambassador for Australia‚Äîthat's what I enjoy most about touring‚Äîrepresenting my country at the highest level\\", Matthews said. \\"There has never been a time in my career since I was picked for Australia eight years ago that I thought I couldn't get back into the Test team.\\" 1992 Tour of Sri Lanka Matthews was picked again for the tour of Sri Lanka and here he did better. In the First Test at Colombo he was Man of the Match as he made 6 and 64, took 3/93 and 4/76 and caught Ranjith Madurasinghe off Shane Warne to give Australia a 16 run win. He followed this up with 55, 51, 57 and 96 to draw the two following Tests and Australia won the series. Matthews topped the batting aggregates for the series with 329 runs. However, Alan Border said \\"Greg's role is to bowl and get wickets. He'll come under the hammer if he goes back to Australia and doesn't take wickets.\\" 1992‚Äì93 season Matthews began the 1992‚Äì93 summer controversially when he was fined 25% of his 1992 players contract for appearing in a magazine crushing a packet of Benson and Hedges cigarettes. He was talking about giving up smoking but Benson and Hedges were a major sponsor of Australian cricket. Matthews' fining was criticised by several anti-smoking activists. Cricket wise he scored 65 helping NSW beat WA. Matthews was kept on as Australia's spinner for the First Test against the West Indies at the Gabba in 1992‚Äì93. \\"His performance over the past 12 months has been sensational\\", said Border. \\"He cops a lot of flak because his strike rate is not as high as some bowlers' but he's a 100 per cent man. It does come down to him taking wickets but I think he can do a job for us.\\" Matthews scored 30 useful runs and dismissed Brian Lara in a controversial stumping decision. However, his bowling was unable to help Australia dismiss the West Indies on the last day (he only took one wicket) and the game ended in a draw. Matthews was picked in the Australian one day team. However, Shane Warne was drafted into the Australian 12 for the second test and although Matthews took 4‚Äì25 against South Australia for NSW in a Sheffield Shield game prior to the test Warne was preferred to Matthews for the final eleven. Warne's 7‚Äì52 in the second innings helped Australia win the game and saw him become Australia's first choice spinner. Matthews was kept on in the Australian 12 for the third test at the Sydney Cricket Ground and played alongside Warne in the final eleven, replacing Mike Whitney. \\"That wicket seems to be just what the doctor ordered for us,\\" Border said. \\"It looks like it's going to play very well but hopefully assist the spinners. That's basically what we wanted to happen and I'm really happy with it. There's no safety-first stuff and we are going to go straight for the jugular.\\" He made 79, but was hit for 2/169 as Brian Lara made 277 in the tourists 606. With Shane Warne in the side Australia no longer needed Matthews as a spinner, he could not get a place on his batting alone and he never played for the Australian test team again. He did keep his place in the one day team that summer. However, his place was threatened by the re emergence of Tim May as an international spinner. \\"They've both done a good job but I think Tim May is forcing the issue, he looks to be in really good form\\", said Border. \\"In Greg's favour is that he bats and fields better than Tim but we've got to make sure Tim is the man to take a few wickets in that middle section a la Peter Taylor. You'd have to say that Greg is better than Tim all-round, but that's probably not what we want from the position. We want the spin bowler to be an attacking one. Getting wickets in that middle session is almost as import ant as getting 0‚Äì20. I'd rather the wickets than 0‚Äì20.\\" Matthews ended up being preferred to May for the one day final series. He bowled well but when it came time to pick the team for the fourth test, Matthews was overlooked in favour of May. May's excellent bowling in that test ensured he was picked over Matthews as Australia's off spinner for the tour of New Zealand. Matthews bowled well domestically that summer‚Äîhe took 5‚Äì61 against Tasmania, 8‚Äì56 against WA. and six wickets against Victoria. His innings of 78 in the Sheffield Shield final was the turning point in the game helping NSW beat Queensland. However, Matthews was overlooked for the Australian tour of England in favour of Warne and May. Matthews later hinted at politics being behind his lack of test cricket. > Some guys chew gum. Some chew their nails. Some abuse their team-mates. I > played air guitar. I sang to the crowd. I sang to myself and I danced. I > said things to the good sorts in the crowd.

I > can't say why; I'm going to write it myself.Andrew Webster, \\"What's the Go, > Mo?\\", Inside Sport accessed 19 December 2012 1993‚Äì94 season Shane Warne and Tim May were very successful on the 1993 Ashes tour, and making breaking back into the Australian team hard for Matthews. At the beginning of the 1993‚Äì94 season he pulled out of the NSW one day team for personal reasons and was sacked from the Sheffield Shield side, the first time he had been dropped from NSW in a decade. However, he was soon back in the side and took 4‚Äì82 and 7‚Äì99 against Tasmania. Matthews travelled to Perth with the NSW team to play WA. Several players went out to a nightclub; Matthews stayed on his own and got in a fight, winding up in hospital. \\"To be out at 4am in the morning is not a good example for young cricketers\\", said NSW managed Neil Marks. Matthews had bruising inside his skull and spent several days in hospital. He decided not to pursue legal action. Matthews was unable to force his way back into the NSW team that season; they still won the Sheffield Shield. 1994‚Äì95 season Matthews endured more controversy over the winter firing a toy pistol at a shop assistant. He was overlooked by NSW selectors at the beginning of the 1994‚Äì95 season. However, his club form was good and NSW struggled at the beginning of the season, so Matthews was recalled. Matthews had a reasonable summer, his form improving towards the end. 1995‚Äì96 season Matthews continued to be an integral member of the NSW side during the 1995‚Äì96 season. \\"Cricket's my thing\\", Matthews said. \\"I just love playing it. What can I tell you‚Äîit's just my thing... The mind is very willing and the body is still pretty strong.\\" By this stage Matthews was well known for a series of TV ads he did for Advance Hair Studio. 1996‚Äì97 season Greg Matthews was appointed captain of NSW for the 1996‚Äì97 season. Coach Geoff Lawson said: > Greg's a very different character. I played with him on debut, I captained > him, but he's never been my kind of person. I don't know that he's anybody's > kind of person for that matter. But, when it came to playing the game, he > could play‚Äîhe's dedicated, talented and he got the job done.

He > proved me very wrong in that regard. I know him as well as anybody. I went > for him in the final washup and it was a huge error. 1997‚Äì98 season In September 1997 Matthews became the New South Wales representative of the Australian Cricketers' Association, which had been formed in August on the 1997 tour of England.p435, Steve Waugh, Out of My Comfort Zone, Michel Joseph, 2006 1997‚Äì98 was his last summer of first-class cricket. His last first-class game was against New Zealand; Matthews scored 71.https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/64/64759.html Later career Matthews continued to play in the Sydney Grade Cricket competition for the University of Sydney team and had a bowling average of 11.04 for the 2008 season. On 24 January 2009, he bowled Australia opener Phil Jaques for 5 with his first ball when Sydney University was playing Sutherland. In 2009 he co-hosted SBS televisions coverage of The Ashes series alongside former Test players Stuart MacGill and Damien Martyn. In 2012 he began to coach part-time for The Sydney Grammar Cricket Club at all-age groups. Advertising By the 1985‚Äì86 season, Matthews's eccentric personality was seen as making him a very saleable commodity. With the Australian cricket coach Bobby Simpson as his manager, he soon became a wealthy man, endorsing a range or products, until he and Simpson fell out.p216, Steve Waugh, Out of My Comfort Zone, Michel Joseph, 2006 He later set up cricket coaching clinics with Steve Waugh and Brad McNamara in 1991‚Äì92.p255, Steve Waugh, Out of My Comfort Zone, Michael Joseph, 2006 However, the distraction of having agents and pushing products unsettled his career, and he was \\"not so good that he can succeed in high company with giving his game everything he has\\". In the mid-1990s, Matthews was employed as a high-profile spokesman for hair regrowth company, Advanced Hair Studio, featuring in a series of advertisements in which he popularised the catchphrase, \\"Advanced Hair, yeah, yeah!\\" Fellow cricketers Graham Gooch, Martin Crowe and Shane Warne later went on to spruik for the same company.

Career Born and raised in Niagara Falls, Ontario, Sabados attended Fanshawe College in London, Ontario where he graduated in 1986 with a diploma in fine art. Moving to Toronto, Sabados became display director for Eatons and Roots Canada, and opened the Sabados Group, Inc., a design firm.

It aired first on CBC Television in Canada and subsequently on the Live Well Network in the United States. Sabados chose not to continue the show on his own or with a new cohost following Hyndman's death in 2015, resulting in its cancellation. Sabados frequently appears as a guest expert on various television shows and as a guest columnist in various design magazines. In an interview given on May 23, 2016 Sabados announced that he would be returning as one of several co- hosts, alongside Jessi Cruickshank and other hosts still to be named, of a new lifestyle program on CBC Television in October 2016.

The story was written by Peter David, penciled by Rich Buckler, and inked by Brett Breeding, Josef Rubinstein, Kyle Baker and Pat Redding. It was the second professional comic book writing assignment for David and the beginning of his \\"break\\" into comic book writing.Peter David. \\"Breaking In, Part Deux\\"; But I Digress Collection. Page 101. Reprinted from the March 19, 1993 Comics Buyer's Guide In this arc, Peter Parker (Spider-Man) hunts down the person who murdered police captain Jean DeWolff, one of his closest friends. Publication history On the first page of \\"Part 4: All My Sins Remembered\\", when Spider-Man remembers his teenage past with Betty Brant, the flashback panels are reprints of panels from earlier issues of Amazing Spider-Man; e.g. the third panel is from Amazing Spider-Man #41. Plot summary After capturing a trio of muggers assaulting Ernie Popchik (an elderly tenant of his Aunt May's), Spider-Man learns that his close friend NYPD Captain Jean DeWolff has been killed in her sleep. Spider-Man confronts the police officer in charge of the investigation, Sergeant Stan Carter. Carter tells him Jean was killed by a close-range double-barreled shotgun blast, and that her badge is missing. Meanwhile, attorney Matt Murdock (the civilian identity of Daredevil) is assigned to represent Popchik's muggers at their arraignment; he succeeds in getting them released without bail, and through his super-senses also finds out Spider-Man's secret identity as Peter Parker when the latter attends the trial in May's and Popchik's company. However, he is disgusted by his clients' rowdy behavior, and speaks with the judge presiding over the case ‚Äî his friend and mentor, Horace Rosenthal ‚Äî about his misgivings with doing pro bono publico work. During their talk he senses an armed and masked intruder in Rosenthal's chamber. After Rosenthal leaves, the intruder introduces himself as the Sin-Eater and tries to shoot Murdock. Hearing the commotion, Rosenthal returns and is shot by the Sin-Eater. The Sin-Eater then escapes through the window. On the streets outside, Spider-Man responds to the panic aroused by the Sin-Eater's appearance. He opens fire on Spider-Man, who leaps above the scattergun blasts. The bullets hit a crowd of bystanders. During their fight, Spider-Man spots a gavel and a badge on the Sin-Eater's belt, and realizes he must be the one who killed Jean DeWolff. However, when he sees Aunt May lying senseless on the ground, he allows the Sin-Eater to escape so that he can help her. Spider-Man successfully petitions Carter for unofficial approval to search DeWolff's apartment. Carter also reveals the folklore behind the term sin-eater, and mentions that he is a former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent. Spider-Man is unable to find any clues in DeWolff's apartment, but discovers a collection of news clippings indicating that she was romantically interested in him. While at Rosenthal's funeral, Murdock recognizes Sin-Eater's heartbeat among those attending DeWollf's funeral nearby, but there are too many mourners for him to pick out which one is the Sin-Eater. Later that night, the Sin-Eater approaches the priest who officiated Jean's funeral, Father Bernard Finn, and shoots him. A media circus breaks out in the city over the Sin-Eater murders, with an opportunistic community leader, Reverend Jackson Tulliver, feeding the flames of public discontent. Spider-Man learns that one of the bystanders hit by the bullets he dodged died from his wounds; Carter assuages Spider-Man's guilt over this. Daredevil and Spider-Man separately comb the underworld, but are unable to find anyone with knowledge of the Sin-Eater. The Sin-Eater enters the Daily Bugle building, demanding to see J. Jonah Jameson (who is actually on vacation). Bugle editor-in-chief Joe Robertson acts as a decoy, and Parker throws a typewriter roller, knocking the Sin-Eater out. The Sin- Eater is identified as Emil Gregg. Gregg has no memory of committing the murders, but claims that voices ordered each one the night before. Convinced that he couldn't resist the voices, he instead went on his mission to kill Jameson early, in the hope that things would then go wrong and he would be caught. However, Daredevil arrives to hear Gregg's confession, and does not recognize Gregg's heartbeat as that of the Sin-Eater he encountered before. Daredevil tells Spider-Man that Emil Gregg must be a copycat. Spider-Man is skeptical, since Gregg has a history of mental instability and knows details of the murders that weren't released to the public, so Daredevil takes him to Gregg's apartment in hope of finding some proof of his innocence. Once there, Daredevil finds the door to the next apartment has been recently jimmied. Some unopened mail reveals the apartment is Stan Carter's, and Daredevil opens a closet to find shotguns, Sin-Eater costumes, and a tape recorder. He deduces that Gregg's \\"voices in the night\\" were actually Carter recording his war journal next door. He also notes that there are two empty gun holsters; Gregg broke into Carter's apartment to take one shotgun, but the other must have been taken by Carter to kill J. Jonah Jameson. Spider-Man realizes Carter is headed to the Jameson house and will most likely kill the only two people there: Jonah's wife Marla and secretary Betty Leeds, who is also the first person Spider-Man fell in love with. He calls the Bugle building and gets the house number from Robertson, then calls there. The phone picks up and he briefly hears Betty's voice, but as he tries to warn her, the only further response he receives is the sound of a shotgun being fired. Spider-Man races to the Jameson house to avenge Betty. When he arrives, however, he finds that Betty is alive, having fended off the Sin-Eater for the past few minutes. Spider-Man defeats Carter and begins beating him mercilessly, not stopping even after he loses consciousness. Daredevil arrives and pulls him away. Spider-Man refuses to back off, and the two superheroes fight. Daredevil taunts Spider-Man, using his enraged emotional state against him, and finally knocks him unconscious. Stan Carter is brought to jail, and the news that the Sin-Eater was a policeman shocks the city. Mr. Popchik \\"snaps\\" at the news and takes his World War II service pistol into the city, determined to prove he is not defenseless. While riding a New York City Subway train, he is threatened by three teenage muggers. He pulls his gun and shoots them, leaving them wounded, and then turns himself in. The police are informed by agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. that Carter was a subject of experiments with modifications of PCP, explaining both his superpowers and his activities as Sin-Eater. Plans to transfer Carter to the prison on Riker's Island leak to the press, and an angry mob besieges the police station. With some riot-geared officers working up a distraction, the police try to board Carter onto a truck, but the mob, led by Jean DeWolff's stepfather, forces itself onto the police, threatening to lynch Carter. Daredevil throws himself in between, but is overwhelmed by the mob. When Spider-Man turns his back, Daredevil cries out \\"Peter!\\". Realizing the mob will kill Daredevil if he doesn't intervene, Spider-Man swings both Carter and Daredevil to safety. After the crowd is dispersed, Carter is safely loaded onto the police truck. Daredevil then reveals his own secret identity to Spider-Man, and after discussing the latter's recent disillusionment for the criminal justice system, Matt offers to arrange for a lawyer for Mr. Popchik through pro bono publico in order to prove his side of the argument. Background Created by Bill Mantlo and Sal Buscema, the acerbic Jean DeWolff had been a supporting character in the Spider-Man comics since her first appearance in Marvel Team-Up #48 (August 1976), and was familiar to readers as one of Spider-Man's few allies in the police force. According to Peter David, \\"The Death of Jean DeWolff\\" came about at the behest of Jim Owsley, at that time editor of the Spider-Man books: \\"I was going to be started on Spectacular Spider-Man and editor Jim Oswley wanted to shake up Spider-Man and the fans. He wanted to see a story in which Jean DeWolff was killed and there were all sorts of cover ups in the police department. So in answer to the second most-asked question I get at conventions, the answer is ‚Äì Owsley wanted to kill her. Not me. I actually had storylines planned with her alive.\\" Owsley himself said, \\"I didn't much care for the whimsical tone of Spectacular Spider-Man, and tried to nudge writer Al Milgrom out of the seat in favor of the brilliant newcomer Peter David... I put Peter David and Rich Buckler on Spectacular, focusing on stories with a serious, \\"grown-up\\" tone and more complex themes.\\"Christopher Priest (Jim Owsley). \\"Adventures in the Funny Book Game Chapter Two: Oswald ‚Äì Why I Never Discuss Spider-Man\\" David combined Owsley's idea of killing off Jean DeWolff with story ideas of his own: \\"I wanted to do a story in which Spider-Man was confronted by a villain who committed crimes so heinous, so appalling, that Spider-Man was pushed to the edge and over. It always struck me as unrealistic how super heroes could turn fights on and off. When you're in a fistfight, adrenaline flows, your heart is thumping. If you knock the guy down and he's not getting up, most times you kick him because you're so pumped and angry. You don't back off and say \\"Had enough?\\" Usually someone has to pull you off the guy. I wanted to do that to Spider-Man because I felt it would bring some hard-edged reality to him. I also wanted to do a story underscoring the philosophical differences between Daredevil and Spider-Man... \\"The Death of Jean DeWolff\\" incorporated all three stories to varying degrees. This was accomplished when Owsley came over to my house early one evening and stayed until after midnight as we hammered out all the kinks in the story in a marathon, four-issue's-worth head-banging session.\\"Peter David, cited in the trade paperback The Death of Jean DeWolff (Marvel Comics, 1990), pp.95‚Äì96 Jim Owsley has recalled the impact of the shotgun-blast ending of Part 3 of the story, \\"a cliffhanger so intense, in fact, that we briefly considered pulling it. It scared the crap out of me, and I was 23. I was imagining soccer moms buying [Spectacular Spider-Man] for their kids by rote, not realizing Sin-Eater was blowing away Betty Brant Leeds inside.\\" Peter David revealed that the idea of the Sin-Eater came from an identically-named character in the 1979 television film The Incredible Journey of Doctor Meg Laurel, as well as claiming that \\"virtually no readers, judging by the letters, tumbled to Stan Carter being the Sin- Eater, even though much of his dialogue fairly screamed it. I knew they wouldn't. First off, I named him Stan. Stan is a friendly name to readers after years of association with Stan Lee. Second, I made him Jewish. Isaac Asimov said if you want to have someone who evil intent must be hidden, make him Jewish and have him speak in semi-Yiddish inverted sentence order. You know. Like Yoda. (\\"So a murderer that makes me?\\") Readers will mentally categorize this as someone who is friendly and even comic relief.\\" David also praised the story's artist, Rich Buckler, \\"whose dynamic and energetic storytelling and gritty texture brought the story to pulsing life. He gave it the kind of down-and-dirty feeling that we were looking for. Kind of Spidey meets Hill Street Blues.\\" \\"Part 3: He Who is Without Sin\\" has a scene in which the Kingpin dictates a letter to a prospective assassin-for-hire, \\"Ms C.B. Kalish.\\" This name is an in-joke in reference to Carol B. Kalish, at that time, Marvel's Direct Sales Manager and Vice President of New Product Development. Kalish was a good friend of Peter David, who worked under her as a sales assistant. David credited Kalish with having made him a comics industry professional. Reception At the time of its original publication, \\"The Death of Jean DeWolff\\" was considered to be a groundbreaking comic book story. Peter David commented that \\"we flew in the face of standard comic book tradition by giving a character, not a noble death in battle at the climax of the story, but an inglorious death, in her sleep, at the beginning.\\" The antagonist of the story is not a supervillain with fantastic powers, but a psychopathic vigilante with a shotgun; also, rather than presenting the bylines at the beginning of each installment, the white-on-black credits were presented in the last panel of each chapter. \\"The Death of Jean DeWolff\\" is still considered to be one of the most popular and acclaimed Spider-Man arcs, collected by Wizard Magazine in its \\"Best of Spider-Man\\" hardcover edition.Wizard Spider-Man Masterpiece Edition Best Of Top 10 Comics Bulletin called the story an exploration of \\"moral relativism amongst superheroes, the flaws of the criminal justice system, and the feelings of rage and desire for vengeance\\", lauded the \\"organic and convincing\\" clash of values between idealist Daredevil and pragmatic Spider-Man. Daredevil is seen as more mature, but also \\"selfish\\" (he kept his secret identity instead of saving the judge's life), and Spider-Man is seen as \\"righteous, but blinded\\" for doing what his conscience tells him but giving in to bloodlust. The arc was called \\"not perfect, but successful and dark\\" and was given four out of five stars.Spider- Man: The Death of Jean DeWolff, Comics Bulletin Peter David has recalled mixed emotions about the arc: in a 1990 installment of \\"But I Digress\\", his then- weekly column in the Comics Buyer's Guide, David stated he was unnerved by the stream of fan mail demanding he bring DeWolff back, and how \\"Spidey Editor Jim Owsley was even told by confident fans at an Atlanta Con, \\"Nah, she's not really dead.\\"\\" David however firmly refused to bring her back, arguing a resurrection in a comic book death-style would weaken the story.PeterDavid. \\"DEAD AND RECOVERING NICELY...\\" peterdavid.net; July 25, 2002; Reprinted from August 3, 1990 Comics Buyer's Guide David also stated that this story established him as a writer, but he was also pigeonholed as a writer of grim and gritty stories.Markisan Naso. \\"Operation Angel\\" Comics Bulletin In 1990, David conceded that \\"people still tell me that \\"The Death of Jean DeWolff\\" is their favourite of my work.\\" Repercussions=\\"Mayhem!\\"= \\"The Death of Jean DeWolff\\" includes a subplot involving a thief dressed as Santa Claus. This storyline was resolved in Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man #112 (Mar. 1986); in this same issue, it is revealed that Ernie Popchik was released from jail after the grand jury refused to indict him. In \\"Mayhem!\\" (Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man #113, Apr. 1986), Mr. Popchik, hounded by the media, returns to Aunt May's boarding home. The muggers he shot at, seeking revenge, break into the home and take Mr. Popchik, Aunt May, and the other boarders hostage. Spider-Man manages to subdue three of the muggers, before defeating the leader by webbing his gun. Aunt May's fianc√©, Nathan Lubensky, opens the blinds, and a police sniper outside shoots and kills the leader. Aunt May is unnerved by Nathan's actions, which led to the youth being killed unnecessarily. Mr. Popchik feels guilty for causing the situation and leaves Aunt May's home. =\\"Return of the Sin-Eater\\"= Peter David brought the Sin-Eater back in The Spectacular Spider-Man #134‚Äì136 (Jan.-March 1988), drawn by Sal Buscema and inked by Vince Colletta. This storyline (informally known as \\"Return of the Sin-Eater\\") explores the origin of the Sin-Eater and his attempted rehabilitation. Set approximately one year after \\"The Death of Jean DeWolff\\", the sequel reveals that after his arrest, Carter was put in psychological and medical care. S.H.I.E.L.D. purged all the drugs from his system, but Carter still had visions of his Sin-Eater persona, as well as being unable to walk or talk properly. After his release, Carter has trouble readjusting to society, and is haunted by visions of the Sin-Eater, as well as having to deal with continuing public outrage over his crimes. Finally succumbing to his madness, Carter puts on a Sin-Eater costume, takes an unloaded shotgun, and goads the police into opening fire on him.Spectacular Spider-Man #134‚Äì136 Peter David described the conclusion of this story as a \\"dramatic, tragic, and perhaps, merciful ending\\" for Stan Carter. =Venom= The Amazing Spider-Man #300 (May 1988) reveals that Daily Globe journalist Eddie Brock wrote an expos√© of the man who claimed to be the Sin-Eater, Emil Gregg. The revelation of Stan Carter being the real Sin-Eater led to Brock being fired and losing his wife. An angry Brock blames Spider-Man for the derailing of his career and life, the catalyst which resulted in his becoming the super-villain Venom. This story, written by David Michelinie, includes the retcon that Gregg's claim to be the Sin-Eater was publicly revealed via a newspaper story by Eddie Brock, instead of by Gregg's confession to the police. Other versions The Ultimate Marvel version of Jean DeWolff (Jeanne DeWolfe) died in Ultimate Spider-Man Annual #2 by Brian Michael Bendis and Mark Brooks. She was shot by the Punisher (who has a similar modus operandi to the Sin-Eater, but is usually shown as a protagonist) for being corrupt.

It was an original story by Crane Wilbur and was bought by Producers Releasing Corporation in 1947 with Wilbur to direct. Eventually the project was acquired by Eagle Lion as a vehicle for Turhan Bey who was under contract to the studio. Bernard Vorhaus was to direct and Muriel Bolton to adapt the story into a script. Vorhaus did the film under a two-picture deal he signed with Eagle Lion. The other lead roles went to Lynn Bari and Cathy O'Donnell; the latter was borrowed from Sam Goldwyn. Crane would go on to become one of Eagle Lion's main writers. Vorhaus later said he was unhappy with the script however and asked for a rewrite. He says producer Ben Stoloff allowed him to hire Ian McLellan Hunter who rewrote the script in a week.Vorhaus p 116 Filming started 5 January 1948. Vorhaus says the shoot went for three weeks.Vorhaus p 116 Bey was under contract to Eagle Lion. He later recalled the film as \\"a fantastic role with wonderful people to work with and a lovely death scene I completely loused up... I just wish all my roles had been as interesting as that one.\\" At one stage the film was also known as The Mystic. Reception At previews, audiences found parts of the film to be funny, resulting in unintended laughter. Eagle Lion were happy with the film. However, when Vorhaus turned down the next movie they offered him, I Married a Communist, the company terminated its association with him.Vorhaus p 119 See also * List of films in the public domain in the United States NotesReferences *  External links   * * Category:1948 films Category:1948 horror films Category:American films Category:American black-and-white films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Bernard Vorhaus Category:American independent films Category:1940s horror thriller films Category:Eagle-Lion Films films Category:Articles containing video clips Category:American horror thriller films ","title":"The Amazing Mr. X"},{"id":"2291906","text":"Richard Napier Luce, Baron Luce, (born 14 October 1936) is former Lord Chamberlain to the Queen from 2000 to 2006, and has been Governor of Gibraltar, a Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) and Government Minister and a crossbench member of the House of Lords.

Thailand has the third largest Buddhist population in the world, after China and Japan, with approximately 64 million Buddhists. Buddhism in Thailand has also become integrated with folk religion as well as Chinese religions from the large Thai Chinese population.'Lamphun's Little-Known Animal Shrines' in: Forbes, Andrew, and Henley, David, Ancient Chiang Mai Volume 1. Chiang Mai ,Cognoscenti Books, 2012. Buddhist temples in Thailand are characterized by tall golden stupas, and the Buddhist architecture of Thailand is similar to that in other Southeast Asian countries, particularly Cambodia and Laos, with which Thailand shares cultural and historical heritage. Buddhism is believed to have come to what is now Thailand as early as 250 BCE, in the time of Indian Emperor Ashoka. Since then, Buddhism has played a significant role in Thai culture and society. Buddhism and the Thai monarchy has often been intertwined, with Thai kings historically seen as the main patrons of Buddhism in Thailand. Although politics and religion were generally separated for most of Thai history, Buddhism's connection to the Thai state would increase in the middle of the 19th century following the reforms of King Mongkut, that would lead to the development of a royally backed sect of Buddhism and increased centralization of the Thai Sangha under the state, with state control over Buddhism increasing further after the 2014 coup d'√©tat. Thai Buddhism is distinguished for its emphasis on short term ordination for every Thai man and its close interconnection with the Thai state and Thai culture. The two official branches, or Nikayas, of Thai Buddhism are the royally backed Dhammayuttika Nikaya and the larger Maha Nikaya.  Historical background  Khmer depiction of Maitreya Bodhisattva of Pre-Angkorian Chenla Buddhist tradition found in Buriram, Thailand. 8th century CE = Early traditions = Some scholars believe that Buddhism must have been flowing into Thailand from India at the time of the Indian emperor Ashoka of the Maurya Empire and into the first millennium after Christ.\\"Some Aspects of Asian History and Culture\\" by Upendra Thakur p.157 During the 5th to 13th centuries, Southeast Asian empires were influenced directly from India and followed Mahayana Buddhism. The Chinese pilgrim Yijing noted in his travels that in these areas, all major sects of Indian Buddhism flourished. Srivijaya to the south and the Khmer Empire to the north competed for influence and their art expressed the rich MahƒÅyƒÅna pantheon of bodhisattvas. From the 9th to the 13th centuries, the MahƒÅyƒÅna and Hindu Khmer Empire dominated much of the Southeast Asian peninsula. Under the Khmer Empire, more than 900 temples were built in Cambodia and in neighboring Thailand. After the decline of Buddhism in India, missions of Sinhalese monks gradually converted the Mon people and the Pyu city-states from Ari Buddhism to TheravƒÅda and over the next two centuries also brought TheravƒÅda Buddhism to the Bamar people, Thailand, Laos and Cambodia, where it supplanted previous forms of Buddhism. Theravada Buddhism was made the state religion only with the establishment of the Sukhothai Kingdom in the 13th century. = 13th‚Äì19th centuries = The details of the history of Buddhism in Thailand from the 13th to the 19th century are obscure, in part because few historical records or religious texts survived the Burmese destruction of Ayutthaya, the capital city of the kingdom, in 1767. Ayutthaya was the center of Thai Tantric Theravada, which included the YogƒÅvacara tradition, and has survived in only a few temples as well as possibly the contemporary Dhammakaya tradition. The Tantric Buddhist YogƒÅvacara tradition was a mainstream Buddhist tradition in Cambodia, Laos and Thailand well into the modern era. An inscription from northern Thailand with tantric elements has been dated to the Sukhothai Kingdom of the 16th century. Kate Crosby notes that this attestation makes the tantric tradition earlier than \\"any other living meditation tradition in the contemporary Theravada world,\\"Kate Crosby, Traditional Theravada Meditation and its Modern-Era Suppression. Hong Kong: Buddhist Dharma Centre of Hong Kong, 2013, predating the popular \\"New Burmese Satipatthana Method\\", better known as Vipassana meditation. The anthropologist-historian S. J. Tambiah, however, has suggested a general pattern for that era, at least with respect to the relations between Buddhism and the sangha on the one hand and the king on the other hand. In Thailand, as in other Theravada Buddhist kingdoms, the king was in principle thought of as patron and protector of the religion (sasana) and the sangha, while sasana and the sangha were considered in turn the treasures of the polity and the signs of its legitimacy. Religion and polity, however, remained separate domains, and in ordinary times the organizational links between the sangha and the king were not close. Ashok pillar at Wat Umong in Chiang Mai Province, Thailand, 13th century. Shows the establishment of Buddhism by Lanna Dynasty's King Mangrai in northern Thailand Among the chief characteristics of Thai kingdoms and principalities in the centuries before 1800 were the tendency to expand and contract, problems of succession, and the changing scope of the king's authority. In effect, some Thai kings had greater power over larger territories, others less, and almost invariably a king who sought successfully to expand his power also exercised greater control over the sangha. That control was coupled with greater support and patronage of the ecclesiastical hierarchy. When a king was weak, however, protection and supervision of the sangha also weakened, and the sangha declined. This fluctuating pattern appears to have continued until the emergence of the Chakri Dynasty in the last quarter of the 18th century. = Modern era = Buddhist monk chants paritta to a group of Siamese women in 1900. King paying homage to Lord Buddha By the 19th century, and especially with the coming to power in 1851 of King Mongkut, who had been a monk himself for twenty-seven years, the sangha, like the kingdom, became steadily more centralized and hierarchical in nature and its links to the state more institutionalized. As a monk, Mongkut was a distinguished scholar of Pali Buddhist scripture. Moreover, at that time the immigration of numbers of monks from Burma was introducing the more rigorous discipline characteristic of the Mon sangha. Influenced by the Mon and guided by his own understanding of the Tipitaka, Mongkut began a reform movement that later became the basis for the Dhammayuttika order of monks. Under the reform, all practices having no authority other than custom were to be abandoned, canonical regulations were to be followed not mechanically but in spirit, and acts intended to improve an individual's standing on the road to nirvana but having no social value were rejected. This more rigorous discipline was adopted in its entirety by only a small minority of monasteries and monks. The Mahanikaya order, perhaps somewhat influenced by Mongkut's reforms but with a less exacting discipline than the Dhammayuttika order, comprised about 95 percent of all monks in 1970 and probably about the same percentage in the late 1980s. In any case, Mongkut was in a position to regularize and tighten the relations between monarchy and sangha at a time when the monarchy was expanding its control over the country in general and developing the kind of bureaucracy necessary to such control. The administrative and sangha reforms that Mongkut started were continued by his successor. In 1902 King Chulalongkorn (Rama V, 1868‚Äì1910) made the new sangha hierarchy formal and permanent through the Sangha Law of 1902, which remained the foundation of sangha administration in modern Thailand.Tuchrello, William P. \\"The Society and Its Environment\\" (Religion: Historical Background section). Thailand: A Country Study. Federal Research Division, Library of Congress; Barbara Leitch LePoer, ed. This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. While Buddhism in Thailand remained under state centralization in the modern era, Buddhism experienced periods of tight state control and periods of liberalization depending on the government at the time. Statistics Approximately 94 percent of Thailand's population is Buddhist (five percent Muslim). Thailand had 39,883 wats (temples). Three hundred-ten are royal wats, the remainder are private (public). There were 298,580 Buddhist monks, 264,442 of the Maha Nikaya order and 34,138 of the Dhammayuttika Nikaya order. There were 59,587 Buddhist novice monks.  Influences  Detail of the entrance gate of thumb Three major forces have influenced the development of Buddhism in Thailand. The most visible influence is that of the Theravada school of Buddhism, imported from Sri Lanka. While there are significant local and regional variations, the Theravada school provides most of the major themes of Thai Buddhism. By tradition, PƒÅli is the language of religion in Thailand. Scriptures are recorded in PƒÅli, using either the modern Thai script or the older Khom and Tham scripts. PƒÅli is also used in religious liturgy, despite the fact that most Thais understand very little of this ancient language. The PƒÅli Tipi·π≠aka is the primary religious text of Thailand, though many local texts have been composed in order to summarise the vast number of teachings found in the Tipi·π≠aka. The monastic code (PƒÅtimokkha) followed by Thai monks is taken from the PƒÅli Theravada Canon. The second major influence on Thai Buddhism is Hindu beliefs received from Cambodia, particularly during the Sukhothai Kingdom. Hinduism played a strong role in the early Thai institution of kingship, just as it did in Cambodia, and exerted influence in the creation of laws and order for Thai society as well as Thai religion. Certain rituals practiced in modern Thailand, either by monks or by Hindu ritual specialists, are either explicitly identified as Hindu in origin, or are easily seen to be derived from Hindu practices. While the visibility of Hinduism in Thai society has been diminished substantially during the Chakri Dynasty, Hindu influences, particularly shrines to the god Brahma, continue to be seen in and around Buddhist institutions and ceremonies. A bhikkhu chants evening prayers inside a monastery located near the town of Kantharalak, Thailand Folk religion‚Äîattempts to propitiate and attract the favor of local spirits known as phi‚Äîforms the third major influence on Thai Buddhism. While Western observers (as well as Western-educated Thais) have often drawn a clear line between Thai Buddhism and folk religious practices, this distinction is rarely observed in more rural locales. Spiritual power derived from the observance of Buddhist precepts and rituals is employed in attempting to appease local nature spirits. Many restrictions observed by rural Buddhist monks are derived not from the orthodox Vinaya, but from taboos derived from the practice of folk magic. Astrology, numerology, and the creation of talismans and charms also play a prominent role in Buddhism as practiced by the average Thai‚Äîpractices that are censured by the Buddha in Buddhist texts (see Digha Nikaya 2, ff). Additionally, more minor influences can be observed stemming from contact with Mahayana Buddhism. Early Buddhism in Thailand is thought to have been derived from an unknown Mahayana tradition. While Mahayana Buddhism was gradually eclipsed in Thailand, certain features of Thai Buddhism‚Äîsuch as the appearance of the bodhisattva Loke≈õvara in some Thai religious architecture, and the belief that the king of Thailand is a bodhisattva himself‚Äîreveal the influence of Mahayana concepts. Budai, Wat Don Phra Chao, Yasothon, Thailand The only other bodhisattva prominent in Thai religion is Maitreya, often depicted in Budai form, and often confused with Phra Sangkajai (), a similar but different figure in Thai Buddhist folklore. Images of one or both can be found in many Thai Buddhist temples, and on amulets as well. Thai may pray to be reborn during the time of Maitreya, or dedicate merit from worship activities to that end. In modern times, additional Mahayana influence has stemmed from the presence of Overseas Chinese in Thai society. While some Chinese have \\"converted\\" to Thai-style Theravada Buddhism, many others maintain their own separate temples in the East Asian Mahayana tradition. The growing popularity of Guanyin, a form of Avalokite≈õvara, may be attributed to the Chinese presence in Thailand.  Government ties  While Thailand is a constitutional monarchy, it inherited a strong Southeast Asian tradition of Buddhist kingship that tied the legitimacy of the state to its protection and support for Buddhist institutions. This connection has been maintained into the modern era, with Buddhist institutions and clergy being granted special benefits by the government, as well as being subjected to a certain amount of governmental oversight. Part of the coronation of the Thai monarch includes the king proceeding to the chapel royal (the Wat Phra Kaew) to vow to be a \\"defender of the faith\\" in front of a chapter of monks including the Supreme Patriarch of Thailand. In addition to the ecclesiastical leadership of the sangha, a secular government ministry supervises Buddhist temples and monks. The legal status of Buddhist sects and reform movements has been an issue of contention in some cases, particularly in the case of Santi Asoke, which was legally forbidden from calling itself a Buddhist denomination, and in the case of the ordination of women attempting to revive the Theravada bhikkhuni lineage have been prosecuted for attempting to impersonate members of the clergy. To obtain a passport for travel abroad, a monk must have an official letter from Sangha Supreme Council granting the applicant permission to travel abroad; Buddhist monk identification card; a copy of house or temple registration; and submit any previous Thai passport or a certified copy. In addition to state support and recognition‚Äîin the form of formal gifts to monasteries made by government officials and the royal family (for example, Kathin)‚Äî-a number of special rights are conferred upon Buddhist monks. They are granted free passage on public transportation, and most train stations and airports have special seating sections reserved for members of the clergy. Conversely, ordained monastics are forbidden from standing for office or voting in elections. = Calls for state religion= In 2007, calls were made by some Buddhist groups for Buddhism to be recognized in the new national constitution as the state religion. This suggestion was initially rejected by the committee charged with drafting the new constitution. This move prompted protests from supporters of the initiative, including a number of marches on the capital and a hunger strike by twelve Buddhist monks.Monks push for Buddhism to be named Thailand's religion Some critics of the plan, including scholar and social critic Sulak Sivaraksa, claimed that the movement to declare Buddhism the national religion is motivated by political gain, manipulated by supporters of ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. The Constitution Drafting Committee later voted against the special status of Buddhism, provoking religious groups. They condemned the committee and the draft constitution. On 11 August 2007, Sirikit, the Queen of Thailand, expressed her concern over the issue. She said, in her birthday speech, that Buddhism is beyond politics. Some Buddhist organizations halted their campaigns the next day. = Government service = No law directly prohibits a member of the Buddhist institutions, such as a monk, a novice and a nun, from being a candidate in an examination for recruitment of government officers. Though both the Council of Ministers and the Sangha Supreme Council, the supervising body of the Thai Buddhist communities, have ordered such prohibition on grounds of appropriateness, according to the Memorandum of the Cabinet's Administrative Department No. NW98/2501 dated 27 June 1958 and the Order of the Sangha Supreme Council dated 17 March 1995. = Elections = The members of the Buddhist community and the communities of other religions are not entitled to elect or be elected as a holder of any government post. For instance, the 2007 constitution of Thailand disfranchises \\"a Buddhist monk, a Buddhist novice, a priest or a clergy member\\" (). The Sangha Supreme Council also declared the same prohibition, pursuant to its Order dated 17 March 1995. At the end of the Order was a statement of grounds given by Nyanasamvara, the Supreme Patriarch. The statement said: = Under the NCPO = Buddhism in Thailand came under greater state control following the 2014 coup d'√©tat. After seizing power the military junta, the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO), set up a National Reform Council with a religious committee led by former Thai senator Paiboon Nititawan and former monk Mano Laohavanich. Calls for reform were spearheaded by right-wing activist monk Phra Buddha Issara, who had close ties with junta leader Prayut Chan-o-cha, and was known for leading the protests in Bangkok that led to the coup. State influence over several aspects of Thai Buddhism increased under the NCPO, with the junta's new constitution stating that the Thai government is to directly support Theravada Buddhism specifically. In 2015, the junta's National Reform Council made several proposals to give the state greater control of Buddhism, including requiring temples to open their finances to the public, ending short-term ordinations, requiring monks to carry smart cards to identify their legal and religious backgrounds, increased control of the bank accounts of temples, increased control of monastic disciplinarians, changing the abbots of all temples every five years, putting the Ministry of Culture in charge of controlling all temple assets, controlling monastic education, and taxing monks. In 2016, Phra Buddha Issara requested that the Department of Special Investigation (DSI) investigate the assets of Thailand's leading monks, the Sangha Supreme Council. This resulted in an alleged tax evasion scandal against Somdet Chuang, the most senior member of the council who was next in line to become supreme patriarch. Although prosecutors did not charge Somdet, the incident postponed his appointment and led to a change in the law that allowed the Thai government to bypass the Sangha Supreme Council and appoint the supreme patriarch directly. This allowed the ruling junta to effectively handpick Thailand's supreme patriarch. In 2017, Somdet Chuang's appointment was withdrawn, with a monk from the Dhammayuttika Nikaya appointed instead. The appointment was made by King Rama X, who chose the name from five given to him by NCPO leader Prayut Chan-o-cha. In February 2017, the junta used Article 44, a controversial section in the interim constitution, to replace the head of the National Office of Buddhism with a DSI official. The DSI official was removed from office a few months later after religious groups called on the government to fire him because of his reform plans, but was reinstated after a few months. In May 2018, the NCPO launched simultaneous raids of four different temples to arrest several monks shortly after a crackdown on protesters on the anniversary of the coup. To the surprise of many officials, one of the monks arrested was Phra Buddha Issara. The right-wing monk was arrested for charges brought against him in 2014, including alleged robbery and detaining officials, however, his most serious charge was a charge of unauthorized use of the royal seal filed in 2017. Police did not state why he was then being arrested for charges filed as far back as four years. One observer described the arrest of Buddha Issara as trying to cover up the true motives or because Buddha Issara knew too much about the rulers and was seen as a threat. Another said that the junta may regard him as a loose canon politically and that the junta is virtue signaling‚Äîdeserving continued political power‚Äîto the new Thai monarch, King Maha Vajiralongkorn. All the monks arrested in the May raids were defrocked shortly after being taken into custody, and detained before trial. Anthropologist Jim Taylor argues that the arrests were the \\"ruling palace regime\\" trying to consolidate royalist power by eliminating non-royalist high-ranking monks. Taylor pointed out that the suspects of the investigations were innocent until proven guilty, yet were all defrocked before trial and stripped of decades of monastic seniority only for being accused of the crimes. The only royalist monk arrested was Buddha Issara. In July 2018, the junta passed a law giving the Thai king the ability to select members of the Sangha Supreme Council, the governing body of Thai monks, instead of the monks themselves. The alleged scandals of the 2017‚Äì18 Thai temple fraud investigations and the resulting arrests were cited as the reason for the change.  Ordination and clergy  A Buddhist monk reciting prayers in Thailand. Buddhist monk receiving food from villagers The funeral pyre at Wat Chedi Luang, Chiang Mai, for Chan Kusalo, the patriarch of northern Thailand As in most other Theravada nations, Buddhism in Thailand is represented primarily by the presence of Buddhist monks, who serve as officiants on ceremonial occasions, as well as being responsible for preserving and conveying the teachings of the Buddha. During the latter half of the 20th century, most monks in Thailand began their careers by serving as temple boys ( dek wat, \\"children of the wat\\"). Temple boys are traditionally no younger than eight and do minor housework. The primary reason for becoming a temple boy is to gain a basic education, particularly in basic reading and writing and the memorization of the scriptures chanted on ritual occasions. Prior to the creation of state-run primary schools in Thailand, village temples served as the primary form of education for most Thai boys. Service in a temple as a temple boy was a necessary prerequisite for attaining any higher education, and was the only learning available to most Thai peasants. Since the creation of a government-run educational apparatus in Thailand, the number of children living as temple boys has declined significantly. However, many government-run schools continue to operate on the premises of the local village temple. Boys now typically ordain as a sƒÅma·πáera or novitiate monks ( samanen, often shortened to nen ). In some localities, girls may become sƒÅma·πáerƒ´. Novices live according to the Ten Precepts but are not required to follow the full range of monastic rules found in the PƒÅtimokkha. There are a few other significant differences between novices and bhikkhus. Novices often are in closer contact with their families, spending more time in the homes of their parents than monks. Novices do not participate in the recitation of the monastic code (and the confessions of violations) that take place on the uposatha days. Novices technically do not eat with the monks in their temple, but this typically only amounts to a gap in seating, rather than the separation observed between monks and the laity. Novices usually ordain during a break from secular schooling, but those intending on a religious life, may receive secular schooling at the wat. Child monks in Thailand Young men typically do not live as a novice for longer than one or two years. At the age of 20, they become eligible to receive upasampada, the higher ordination that establishes them as a full bhikkhu. A novice is technically sponsored by his parents in his ordination, but in practice in rural villages the entire village participates by providing the robes, alms bowl, and other requisites that will be required by the monk in his monastic life. Temporary ordination is the norm among Thai Buddhists. Most young men traditionally ordain for the term of a single vassa or rainy season (Thai phansa). Those who remain monks beyond their first vassa typically remain monks for between one and three years, officiating at religious ceremonies in surrounding villages and possibly receiving further education in reading and writing (possibly including the Khom or Tai Tham alphabets traditionally used in recording religious texts). After this period of one to three years, most young monks return to secular life, going on to marry and start a family. Young men in Thailand who have undergone ordination are seen as being more suitable partners for marriage; unordained men are euphemistically called \\"unripe\\", while those who have been ordained are said to be \\"ripe\\". A period as a monk is a prerequisite for many positions of leadership within the village hierarchy. Most village elders or headmen were once monks, as were most traditional doctors, spirit priests, and some astrologists and fortune tellers. In a country where most males can be ordained as monks for even short periods of time, the experience can be profitable. The Thai musician, Pisitakun Kuantalaeng, became a monk for a short period following the death of his father in order to make merit. He observed that, \\"Being a monk is good money,...When you go and pray you get 300 baht [about ¬£7] even though you have no living expenses, and you can go four times a day. Too many monks in Thailand do it to get rich. If you become a monk for three months you have enough money for a scooter.\\" Monks who do not return to secular life typically specialize in either scholarship or meditation. Those who specialize in scholarship typically travel to regional education centers to begin further instruction in the PƒÅli language and the scriptures, and may then continue on to the major monastic universities in Bangkok. The scholarship route is also followed by monks who desire to rise in the ecclesiastic hierarchy, as promotions within the government-run system are contingent on passing examinations in PƒÅli and Dhamma studies. The Thai tradition supports laymen to go into a monastery, dress and act as monks, and study while there. The time line is based on threes, staying as a monk for three days, or three weeks, or three months or three years, or three weeks and three days. This retreat is expected of all Thai males, rich or poor, and often is scheduled after high school. Such retreats bring honor to the family and blessings (merit) to the young man. Thais make allowances for men who follow this practice, such as holding open a job. =Health issues= Rising obesity among monks and concerns for their well-being has become an issue in Thailand. A study by the Health Ministry in 2017 of 200 Bangkok temples found that 60 percent of monks suffer from high cholesterol and 50 percent from high blood sugar. Public health experts attribute this to two factors. First, monks are required to accept and eat whatever is given to them on their daily alms rounds. Second, monks are not permitted to engage in cardiovascular exercise as it is undignified. Monks eat only two meals per day, breakfast and lunch. But the remainder of the day they are allowed to drink nam pana, which includes the juice of fruit less than fist-sized, often high in sugar. To combat the high rate of non-communicable diseases among monks, the National Health Commission Office (NHCO) issued a pamphlet, National Health Charter for Monks, designed to educate monks and laypeople alike as to healthy eating habits.  Controversies  The Thai media often reports on Buddhist monks behaving in ways that are considered inappropriate. There have been reports of sexual assault, embezzlement, drug-taking, extravagant lifestyles, even murder. Thailand's 38,000 temples, populated by 300,000 monks, are easy targets for corruption, handling between US$3 to 3.6 billion yearly in donations, mostly untraceable cash. In a case that received much media attention, Luang Pu Nen Kham Chattiko was photographed in July 2013 wearing Ray-Ban sunglasses, holding a Louis Vuitton bag full of US dollars, and \\"...was later found to be a trafficker of methamphetamines, an abuser of women and the lover of a pregnant fourteen-year-old.\\" There have been cases of influential monks persecuted and jailed by the Thai government, through verdicts later declared moot or controversial. A well-known case in Thailand is that of Phra Phimontham, then abbot of Wat Mahadhatu, known in Thailand for having introduced the Burmese Satipatthana meditation method to Thailand. In 1962, during the Cold War, he was accused of collaboration with communist rebels and being a threat to national security, and was fully defrocked and jailed. In fact, the government persecuted him because of his political views and promotion of changes in the Sangha. Phra Phimontham had strong pro-democratic leanings, which did not comport well with the regime of the day nor the palace. Furthermore, Phra Phimontham was part of the Maha Nikaya fraternity, rather than the Dhammayuttika fraternity, which the government and monarchy historically have preferred. Phra Phimontham was likely to become the next supreme patriarch. For this reason, his treatment has been described by Thai scholars as a \\"struggle between patriarchs\\" (), referring to the political objective of disabling him as a candidate. After four years, when the country changed its government, Phra Phimontham was released from prison when a military court decided he had not collaborated with communists after all. Afterwards, he ordained again and eventually regained his former status, though he continued to be discredited. Buddhadasa Bhikkhu was subject to similar allegations from the Thai government, and so was Luang Por Phothirak, the founder of Santi Asoke. Luang Por Pothirak was eventually charged of altering the Vinaya and defrocked. A recent example is Phra Prajak Kuttajitto, an environmentalist monk critical of government policies, who was arrested and defrocked.

Wat Phra Dhammakaya denied this, stating that it was the intention of the donors to give the land to the abbot and not the temple, and that owning personal property is common and legal in the Thai Sangha. Widespread negative media coverage at this time was symptomatic of the temple being made the scapegoat for commercial malpractice in the Thai Buddhist temple communityWiktorin, Pierre (2005) De Villkorligt Frigivna: Relationen mellan munkar och lekfolk i ett nutida Thailand (Stockholm: Almqvist & Wiksell International) p.137 ISSN 1653-6355Julian Gearing (1999) Buddhist Scapegoat?: One Thai abbot is taken to task, but the whole system is to blame Asiaweek 30 December 1999 < in the wake of the 1997 Asian financial crisis.Bangkokbiznews 24 June 2001 p.11 The Sangha Supreme Council declared that Luang Por Dhammajayo had not broken any serious offenses against monastic discipline (Vinaya). In 2006, the Thai National Office for Buddhism cleared the Dhammakaya Foundation and Luang Por Dhammajayo of all accusations when Luang Por Dhammajayo agreed offer all of the disputed land to the name of his temple. In March 2016, Thai police formally summoned then Acting Supreme Patriarch Somdet Chuang Varapunno, after he refused to answer direct questions about his vintage car, one of only 65 made. The car was part of a museum kept at Wat Paknam Bhasicharoen in Bangkok, but has now been seized by police investigating possible tax evasion. Somdet reportedly transferred ownership of the vehicle to another monk after the scandal broke. He refused to answer police questions directly, insisting that written questions be sent to his lawyer. He did say that the car was a gift from a follower. Analysts from different news outlets have pointed out that the actions of the Thai government towards Wat Paknam Bhasicharoen may have reflected a political need to control who should be selected as the next Supreme Patriarch, since Somdet had already been proposed as a candidate by the Sangha Supreme Council. Selecting him would mean a Supreme Patriarch from the Maha Nikaya fraternity, rather than the Dhammayuttika fraternity, which historically has always been the preferred choice of the Thai government and the monarchy. In fact, Somdet Chuang's nomination was postponed and eventually withdrawn after the Thai government changed the law in December 2016 to allow King Vajiralongkorn to appoint the Supreme Patriarch directly, with Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha countersigning, leading to the appointment of a monk from the Dhammayuttika fraternity instead. The Thai government cited several reasons for this, including the car. At the end of the same year, however, prosecutors decided not to charge Somdet Chuang, but to charge his assistant abbot instead, and another six people who had part in importing the vintage car. In February 2016, in a protest organized by the National Centre for the Protection of Thai Buddhism, a Red Shirt-oriented network, the example of Phra Phimontham was also cited as demands were made for the Thai government to no longer involve itself with the selection of the next leader of the Sangha.  Reform movements  * The Dhammayuttika Nikaya () began in 1833 as a reform movement led by Prince Mongkut, son of King Rama II of Siam. It remained a reform movement until passage of the Sangha Act of 1902, which formally recognized it as the lesser of Thailand's two Theravada denominations.Buddhism in Contemporary Thailand , Prof. Phra Thepsophon, Rector of Mahachulalongkorn Buddhist University. Speech at the International Conference on Buddhasasana in Theravada Buddhist countries: Issue and The Way Forward in Colombo, Sri Lanka, January 15, 2003, Buddhism in Thailand, Dhammathai ‚Äì Buddhist Information Network Mongkut was a bhikkhu under the name of Vajira√±ƒÅ·πáo for 27 years (1824‚Äì1851) before becoming King of Siam (1851‚Äì1868). In 1836 he became the first abbot of Wat Bowonniwet Vihara. After the then 20-year-old prince entered monastic life in 1824, he noticed what he saw as serious discrepancies between the rules given in the PƒÅli Canon and the actual practices of Thai bhikkhus and sought to upgrade monastic discipline to make it more orthodox. Mongkut also made an effort to remove all non-Buddhist, folk religious, and superstitious elements which over the years had become part of Thai Buddhism.Ratanakosin Period , Buddhism in Thailand, Dhammathai ‚Äì Buddhist Information Network Dhammayuttika monks were expected to eat only one meal a day (not two) that was to be gathered during a traditional alms round. * The Dhammakaya Movement is a Thai Buddhist tradition which was started by Luang Pu Sodh Candasaro in the early 20th century. The tradition is revivalist in nature and practices Dhammakaya meditation. The movement opposes traditional magical rituals, superstition, folk religious practices, fortune telling and giving lottery numbers, and focuses on an active style of propagating and practicing meditation. Features of the tradition include teaching meditation in a group, teaching meditation during ceremonies, teaching meditation simultaneously to monastics and lay people, teaching one main meditation method and an emphasis on lifelong ordination. * The Santi Asoke ( \\"Peaceful Asoka\\") or Chao Asok (\\"People of Asoka\\") was established by Phra Bodhirak after he \\"declared independence from the Ecclesiastical Council (Sangha) in 1975\\". Santi Asoke has been described as \\"a transformation of the \\"forest monk\\" revival of [the 1920s and 1930s]\\" and \\"is more radical [than the Dhammakaya Movement] in its criticism of Thai society and in the details of its own vision of what constitutes a truly religiomoral community.\\" * The Sekhiya Dhamma Sangha are a group of activist monks focusing on modern issues in Thailand (i.e., deforestation, poverty, drug addiction, and AIDS). The group was founded in 1989 among a growth of Buddhist social activism in Thailand in the latter half of the 20th century. While criticized for being too concerned and involved with worldly issues, Buddhist social activists cite duty to the community as justification for participation in engaged Buddhism  Position of women  Although women in Thailand traditionally cannot ordain as bhikkhuni, they can choose to take part in quasi-monastic practices at temples and practice centers as maechi. Unlike in Burma and Sri Lanka, the bhikkhuni lineage of women monastics was never established in Thailand. Women primarily participate in religious life either as lay participants in collective merit-making rituals or by doing domestic work around temples. A small number of women choose to become maechi, non-ordained religious specialists who permanently observe either the Eight or Ten Precepts. Maechi do not receive the level of support given to bhikkhu and their position in Thai society is the subject of some discussion. There have been efforts to attempt to introduce a bhikkhuni lineage in Thailand as a step towards improving the position of women in Thai Buddhism. The main proponent of this movement has been Dhammananda Bhikkhuni. Unlike similar efforts in Sri Lanka, these efforts have been extremely controversial in Thailand. Women attempting to ordain have been accused of attempting to impersonate monks (a civil offense in Thailand), and their actions have been denounced by many members of the ecclesiastic hierarchy. In 1928 a secular law was passed in Thailand banning women's full ordination in Buddhism. Varanggana Vanavichayen became the first female monk to be ordained in Thailand in 2002. Some time after this, the secular law was revoked. On , Dhammananda Bhikkhuni received full monastic ordination as a bhikkhuni of the Theravada tradition in Sri Lanka, making her the first modern Thai woman to receive full ordination as a Theravada bhikkhuni.archive.org:‡∏™‡∏∏‡∏ß‡∏¥‡∏î‡∏≤ ‡πÅ‡∏™‡∏á‡∏™‡∏µ‡∏´‡∏ô‡∏≤‡∏ó, ‡∏ô‡∏±‡∏Å‡∏ö‡∏ß‡∏ä‡∏™‡∏ï‡∏£‡∏µ‡πÑ‡∏ó‡∏¢‡πÉ‡∏ô‡∏û‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏û‡∏∏‡∏ó‡∏ò‡∏®‡∏≤‡∏™‡∏ô‡∏≤ ‡∏û‡∏•‡∏±‡∏á‡∏Ç‡∏±‡∏ö‡πÄ‡∏Ñ‡∏•‡∏∑‡πà‡∏≠‡∏ô‡∏Ñ‡∏∏‡∏ì‡∏ò‡∏£‡∏£‡∏°‡∏™‡∏π‡πà‡∏™‡∏±‡∏á‡∏Ñ‡∏°, ‡∏®‡∏π‡∏ô‡∏¢‡πå‡∏™‡πà‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏™‡∏£‡∏¥‡∏°‡πÅ‡∏•‡∏∞‡∏û‡∏±‡∏í‡∏ô‡∏≤‡∏û‡∏•‡∏±‡∏á‡πÅ‡∏ú‡πà‡∏ô‡∏î‡∏¥‡∏ô‡πÄ‡∏ä‡∏¥‡∏á‡∏Ñ‡∏∏‡∏ì‡∏ò‡∏£‡∏£‡∏°, 1999, page 45-6 She is Abbess of Songdhammakalyani Monastery, the only temple in Thailand where there are bhikkhunis. It was founded by her mother, Voramai, a Mahayana bhikkhuni, in the 1960s. No one denies that men and women have an equal chance to attain enlightenment. In Mahayana Buddhism, practised in Taiwan, mainland China, Hong Kong, and Tibet, female ordinations are common, but in countries that adhere to the Theravada branch of the religion, such as Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Myanmar, women were banned from becoming ordained about eight centuries ago, \\"for fear that women entering monastic life instead of bearing children would be a disruption of social order\\", according to Kittipong Narit, a Buddhist scholar at Bangkok's Thammasat University. Critics charge that the ban on female ordination is about patriarchy and power. The status quo benefits those in power and they refuse to share the perks with outsiders. Most objections to the reintroduction of a female monastic role hinge on the fact that the monastic rules require that both five ordained monks and five ordained bhikkhunis be present for any new bhikkhuni ordination. Without such a quorum, critics say that it is not possible to ordain any new Theravada bhikkhuni. The Thai hierarchy refuses to recognize ordinations in the Dharmaguptaka tradition (the only currently existing bhikkhuni ordination lineage) as valid Theravada ordinations, citing differences in philosophical teachings and, more critically, monastic discipline.

Background The band was founded in 1964 by John \\"Mouse\\" Michalski (born 1948, Cleveland, Ohio) playing lead guitar and Roy Chaney (born 1948, Indianapolis, Indiana) playing bass guitar. The two were high school friends who had previously played in several short-lived bands, most notably a surf rock group named The Citations. As the British Invasion's influence took effect, the band changed in musical direction. After going by the name The Squires for a short time, along with several line-up changes, the Count Five was born. John \\"Sean\\" Byrne (1947‚Äì2008, born Dublin, Ireland) played rhythm guitar and performed lead vocals, Kenn Ellner played tambourine and harmonica, while sharing lead vocals, and Craig \\"Butch\\" Atkinson (1947‚Äì1998, born San Jose, California) played drums. The Count Five were recognizable for their habit of wearing Count Dracula-style capes when playing live. \\"Psychotic Reaction\\", an acknowledged cornerstone of garage rock, was initially devised by Byrne, with the group refining it and turning it into the highlight of their live sets. The song was influenced by the style of contemporary musicians such as The Standells and The Yardbirds. The band was rejected by several record labels before they got signed to the Los Angeles-based Double Shot Records. \\"Psychotic Reaction\\" was released as a single, peaking at number five in the U.S. charts in late 1966. The band enjoyed limited success for a short time, dropping out of view altogether when their only hit had fallen from public memory. Another setback to a potential career in the music business was the decision of four of the five members (who at that time were between the ages of 17 and 22) to pursue college degrees. Several months before the retirement of the band, David Eugene McDowell, the youngest player at 17 hooked up with the group as a guitar player for their last several months as a band. \\"Dave\\" shortly later went on to join up with Billy Nix and the Ideals as their Bass player. By 1969, the Count Five had broken up, but their memory was immortalized in a 1971 essay by rock journalist Lester Bangs, entitled \\"Psychotic Reactions and Carburetor Dung.\\" In the essay, Bangs credited the band for having released several later albums (after Psychotic Reaction): Carburetor Dung, Cartesian Jetstream, Ancient Lace and Wrought-Iron Railings, and Snowflakes Falling On the International Dateline ‚Äî each displaying an increasing sense of artistry and refinement. However, none of these subsequent albums actually existed except in Bangs' own imagination. The Count Five reunited only once, when they performed a concert on April 11, 1987 at a club in Santa Clara, California called \\"One Step Beyond\\". This performance has been released as Psychotic Reunion LIVE!. The song \\"Psychotic Reaction\\" can be heard playing on the jukebox in an early scene in Wim Wenders' film Alice in the Cities (1974) and in the party scene in The Sense of an Ending (2017). It can also be heard on the season one finale of the HBO drama series Vinyl. Craig Atkinson died on October 13, 1998. John \\"Sean\\" Byrne died on December 15, 2008 at 61 from cirrhosis of the liver.San Jose rock pioneer John Byrne of the Count Five dies at 61 Roy Chaney formed a new band in the 1990s called The Count (with Byrne and drummer Rocco Astrella (born Mar 20, 1951 ‚Äì died Mar 1, 2014, who played in the last version of the original group). The Count released their debut CD, Can't Sleep, in 2002. In 2006, Count Five was among the first bands inaugurated into the San Jose Rock Hall of Fame.

Cairo, Egypt May 1, 1924; d. K√∂nigstein, Germany, November 23, 1988) was an Egyptian classical music composer, educator, and pianist. His best-known work is the symphony Osiris. Life and career Abdel-Rahim was born in Cairo to a musical father, and began playing the piano at an early age. His early musical studies were supported by the Music Society of the Faculty of Arts of Cairo University (then called Fuad I University), graduating with a degree in history. In 1950 he began university studies in musicology at the Musikhochschule of Heidelberg in West Germany, deciding on a career as a composer. From 1952 to 1957 he studied composition with Harald Genzmer (a pupil of Paul Hindemith) at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik Freiburg. In 1959, Abdel-Rahim was appointed to teach theory and harmony at the newly opened Cairo Conservatory of Music. He was later appointed head of the composition department there (the first of its kind in the Arab world), which he founded in 1971. Abdel-Rahim was quite influential among Egyptian composers of the next generation, as the majority of them studied with him during his time at the Cairo Conservatory. Abdel- Rahim's style fuses traditional Egyptian musical elements with contemporary European elements, focusing on Egyptian materials in his later works more than in his earlier works. He composed many works for orchestra, chorus, and chamber ensembles, as well as songs and music for film, theater, and ballet. He was awarded the State Prize for Composition, as well as the Order of Arts, from the Egyptian government. Abdel-Rahim was married to Samha El-Kholy (1925-2006), a noted Egyptian musicologist and former president of the Academy of Arts in Cairo. Abdel-Rahim died in Frankfurt, Germany. His notable students include Ahmed El-Saedi, Rageh Daoud, Mona Ghoneim, Khaled Shokry, Sherif Mohie El Din, Nader Abbasy, Ali Osman, and Mohamed Abdelwahab Abdelfattah.

The composition is based on \\"Son of a Gambolier\\", composed by Charles Ives in 1895, the lyrics of which are based on an old English and Scottish drinking song of the same name. It first appeared in print in the 1908 Blueprint, Georgia Tech's yearbook. The song was later sung by the Georgia Tech Glee Club on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1953, and by Richard Nixon and Nikita Khrushchev during the 1959 Kitchen Debate.McMath, p.276Wallace, p.106Georgia Tech - Official Student Handbook \\"Ramblin' Wreck\\" is played after every Georgia Tech score in a football game, directly after a field goal or safety, and preceded by \\"Up With the White and Gold\\" after a touchdown. It is also frequently played during timeouts at the team's basketball games. The term \\"Ramblin' Wreck\\" has been used to refer to students and alumni of Georgia Tech much longer than the Model A now known as the Ramblin' Wreck has been in existence. The expression has its origins in the late 19th century and was used originally to refer to the makeshift motorized vehicles constructed by Georgia Tech engineers employed in projects in the jungles of South America. Other workers in the area began to refer to these vehicles and the men who drove them as \\"Rambling Wrecks from Georgia Tech.\\" Lyrics Georgia Tech is \\"Ramblin' Wreck,\\" after the vehicle and school mascot shown here.alt=Six women, wearing a uniform of a white skirt and a white and gold cropped top with the word \\"Tech\\" on the front, ride onto the football field on the running boards and rear seat of a white-and-gold- painted antique car. > I'm a Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech, and a hell of an engineer-- A > helluva, helluva, helluva, helluva, hell of an engineer. Like all the jolly > good fellows, I drink my whiskey clear. I'm a Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia > Tech and a hell of an engineer. Oh! If I had a daughter, sir, I'd dress her > in White and Gold, And put her on the campus to cheer the brave and bold. > But if I had a son, sir, I'll tell you what he'd do-- He would yell, 'To > hell with Georgia!' like his daddy used to do. Oh, I wish I had a barrel of > rum and sugar three thousand pounds, A college bell to put it in and a > clapper to stir it round. I'd drink to all the good fellows who come from > far and near. I'm a ramblin', gamblin', hell of an engineer! Previous adaptations The earliest rendition of the song is \\"Son of a Gambolier\\" (also known as \\"A Son of a Gambolier\\" and \\"The Son of a Gambolier\\"), which is a lament to one's own poverty; a gambolier is \\"a worthless individual given to carousing, gambling, and general moral depravity.\\" The chorus goes: > Like every jolly fellow I takes my whiskey clear, For I'm a rambling rake of > poverty And the son of a gambolier. The tune was first adapted as a school song by Dickinson College in southern Pennsylvania in the 1850s. Students at the college modified it to include a reference to their college bell by adding the following lyrics: > I wish I had a barrel of rum, And sugar three hundred pounds, The college > bell to mix it in, The clapper to stir it round In 1857, the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity published a songbook that contained a heavily modified version of the song. The adapted chorus used the following lyrics: > I'm a son of a, son of a, son of a, son of a, son of a DKE! I'm a son of a, > son of a, son of a, son of a, son of a DKE! Like every college fellow, I > like my whiskey free, For I'm a rambling rake of a college man, And the son > of a DKE! The song was subsequently adapted by the Colorado School of Mines in the late 1870s and entitled \\"The Mining Engineer.\\" This version is the closest adaptation to \\"Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech.\\" > Like every honest fellow, I take my whisky clear, I'm a rambling wreck from > Golden Tech, a helluva engineer. The Mines version also includes: > Oh, if I had a daughter I'd dress her up in green, And send her up to > Boulder To coach the football team But if I had a son, sir, I'll tell you > what he'd do-- He'd yell: 'TO HELL WITH BOULDER!' Like his daddy used to do. The song is also used by the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, entitled \\"Ramblin' Wreck\\" although on campus it is referred to simply as the \\"School Song.\\" This version is almost identical to the first four lines of \\"Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech.\\" > I'm a rambling wreck from Rapid Tech, and a helluva engineer. a helluva, > helluva, helluva, helluva, hell of an engineer. Like all my jolly good > fellows, I drink my whiskey clear, I'm a rambling wreck from Rapid Tech, and > a helluva engineer. Hey! In the early 1890s, Ohio State University adapted it and called it \\"If I had a Daughter\\". At the time Ohio Wesleyan University was their archrival, hence the references to Delaware, Ohio and Methodists. One verse follows: > If I had a daughter, I'd dress her up in green, I'd send her on the campus > to coach the Freshman team; And if I had a son, I tell you what he'd do He > would yell \\"To Hell\\" with Delaware\\" And yell for O. S. U. In 1895, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute adapted it and called it \\"A Son of Old R.P.I.\\" This version includes the lyrics: > Like every honest fellow, I drink my whiskey clear, I'm a moral wreck from > the Polytech And a hell of an engineer. The Clemson University Tiger Band's rude songbook, The Unhymnal\\", has a four- verse parody of the fight song which is distinctly un-politically correct which derides the Georgia Tech coach, football team and cheerleaders.The Unhymnal - Unofficial songbook of the Clemson University bands, various editions, 1974-1995, Clemson University, Clemson, South Carolina. In 1929 Norwegian University of Science and Technology adapted it and called it \\"Nu klinger\\". > Studenter i den gamle stad, ta vare p√• byens ry!

Two different sources are claimed to have been the origin for the song's music. The first is the marching tune \\"The Bonnie Blue Flag\\", published in 1861 by Harry McCarthy. The second, and more widely cited, is Charles Ives' composition of \\"Son of a Gambolier\\" in 1895.Wallace, p.104 Creation at Georgia Tech Blue Print, entitled \\"What Causes Whitlock to Blush\\". The words \\"hell\\" and \\"helluva\\" were too hot to print: at the bottom, it explains that \\"Owing to the melting of the type, it has been impossible to print the parts of the above song represented by blank spaces\\".alt=A white page with black text. \\"What Causes Whitlock to Blush\\" is written across the top. Georgia Tech's use of the song is said to have come from an early baseball game against rival Georgia. Some sources credit Billy Walthall, a member of the school's first four-year graduating class, with the lyrics. According to a 1954 article in Sports Illustrated, \\"Ramblin' Wreck\\" was written around 1893 by a Tech football player on his way to an Auburn game. In 1905, Georgia Tech adopted the tune as its official fight song, though it had already been the unofficial fight song for several years. It was published for the first time in the school's first yearbook, the 1908 Blueprint.Wallace, p.105 Entitled \\"What causes Whitlock to Blush\\", words such as \\"hell\\" and \\"helluva\\" were censored as \\"certain words [are] too hot to print\\". After Michael A. Greenblatt, Tech's first bandmaster, heard the Georgia Tech band playing the song to the tune of Charles Ives's \\"A Son of a Gambolier\\", he wrote a modern musical version. In 1911, Frank Roman succeeded Greenblatt as bandmaster; Roman embellished the song with trumpet flourishes and publicized it. Roman copyrighted the song in 1919. Rise to fame alt=There are four separate scenes portrayed, on in each corner, all in black and white. In the top-left picture, there are many people with brass musical instruments standing in front of a brick building. On the bottom-right corner of that scene, there is a large drum.

In the bottom-left picture, a woman and a hat and a jacket is standing. There is a man and some children behind her. In the bottom-right picture, many people wearing headphones are surrounding some electronic equipment sitting on a table. In 1920, dance instructor Arthur Murray organized the world's first \\"radio dance\\" while he attended Tech. A band on campus played \\"Ramblin' Wreck\\" and other songs, which were broadcast to a group of about 150 dancers (mostly Tech students) on the roof of the Capital City Club in downtown Atlanta.Wallace, p.155 Murray also opened the first Arthur Murray Dance Studio while in Atlanta. It was located at the Georgian Terrace Hotel. In 1925, the Columbia Gramophone Company began selling a recording of Tech songs (including \\"Ramblin' Wreck\\"); Tech was one of the first colleges in the Southern United States to have its songs recorded. The song became immensely popular and was known nationally because of its extensive radio play. In 1947, the song was performed by The Gordonaires in a Soundie entitled \\"Let's Sing A College Song\\". On October 11, 1953, the Georgia Tech Glee Club sang \\"Ramblin' Wreck\\" on Ed Sullivan's \\"Toast of the Town\\" program (later known as The Ed Sullivan Show) on CBS. The performance reached a television audience of approximately 30 million viewers. Because only 28 seats were available on the train to the show, Glee Club members auditioned for the available spots. The group prepared three songs--\\"Ramblin' Wreck,\\" There's Nothin' Like a Dame, and the alma mater. Sullivan made them sing \\"heck\\" and \\"heckuva\\" instead of \\"hell\\" and \\"helluva,\\" and would not let them sing \\"dames.\\" According to The Technique, \\"The club sang 'Dames' at rehearsal and brought down the house, only to have Sullivan give it the axe.\\" Then-Vice President Richard Nixon and Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev sang the song together when they met in Moscow in 1959 to reduce the tension between them during the Kitchen Debate. As the story goes, Nixon did not know any Russian songs, but Khrushchev knew that one American song as it had been sung on the Ed Sullivan show. \\"Ramblin' Wreck\\" has had many other notable moments in history. It has been reported to be the first school song played in space.History of Georgia Tech Songs and Music Quote: \\"It has also been reported to be the first school song played in space.\\" Gregory Peck sang the song while strumming a mandolin in the movie The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit. John Wayne whistled it in The High and the Mighty. Tim Holt's character sings a few bars of it in the movie His Kind of Woman. Gordon Jones sings a few stanzas several times in the movie My Sister Eileen. There are numerous stories of commanding officers in Higgins boats crossing the English Channel on the morning of D-Day leading their men in the song to calm their nerves. Modern history The alt=There is a large football stadium with yellow bleachers and green grass, seen at night. The band is on the field facing the viewer, wearing white uniforms, holding instruments, and arranged to form an interlocking GT. Many people are in the stands. The Edwin H. Morris & Company obtained a copyright to Roman's version in 1931. The copyright to that version expired in 1952, so Greenblatt wrote a new arrangement and applied for a new copyright. In 1953, Greenblatt sold the copyright for the new version to Georgia Tech for one dollar. There was some controversy when MPL Communications acquired the old copyright; a law firm commissioned by Georgia Tech in 1984, Newton, Hopkins & Ormsby, concluded that while there were copyrighted versions of the song, the version used by the school was not copyrighted and falls in the public domain. Over the years, a few variations of the song have been created at Georgia Tech. In 1998, a 19-member \\"Diversity Task Force\\" proposed that changes be made to the song because it discriminated against women. The proposal was widely and strongly opposed by students and alumni, and it was dropped. A different request to change the word cheer to join with respect to alumni daughters surfaced in 2015.http://www.ledger- enquirer.com/news/local/news-columns-blogs/richard-hyatt/article39656085.html At the conclusion of the song there is a call of \\"Go Jackets!\\" responded to with \\"Bust their ass!\\" Following three of these calls and responses, the song was ended with a call of \\"Go Jackets! Fight! Win!\\" Recently, however, the student body has yelled \\"Fight! Win! Drink! Get Naked!\\" On March 28, 2018, a German version of the song premiered during the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts Distinguished Alumni Awards event. The German version, written and arranged by Stephen C. Hall (Industrial Management, 1967), Jerry A. Ulrich (School of Music), and Richard Utz (School of Literature, Media, and Communication), was performed by the Georgia Tech Glee Club in honor of the awarding of the College's Dean's Appreciation Award to Barry (Mechanical Engineering, 1965) and Gail Spurlock, in recognition of their support for program initiatives in Germany, specifically Georgia Tech‚Äôs German and German Languages for Business and Technology (LBAT).https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gyc8xjn8Lo References Works cited  * * External links *Official Georgia Tech Athletics page on song (with audio file) Category:American college songs Category:College fight songs in the United States Category:Atlantic Coast Conference fight songs Category:Drinking songs Category:Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets ","title":"Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech"},{"id":"2291978","text":"Robin Berry Janvrin, Baron Janvrin, (born 20 September 1946) is a British courtier who was Private Secretary to Elizabeth II from February 1999 to September 2007.

Reece is among a group of jazz musicians born in Jamaica which includes Bertie King, Joe Harriott, Roland Alphonso, Wilton Gaynair, Sonny Bradshaw and Tommy McCook, trombonist Don Drummond, pianist Monty Alexander, bassist Coleridge Goode, guitarist Ernest Ranglin and percussionists Count Ossie and Lloyd Knibb. Biography Reece was born on 5 January 1931 in Kingston, Jamaica, the son of a silent film pianist. He attended the Alpha Boys School (known for its musical alumni), switching from baritone saxophone to trumpet when he was 14 years old. A full-time musician from the age of 16, he moved to London in 1948 and spent the 1950s working in Europe, much of that time in Paris. He played with Don Byas, Kenny Clarke, Frank Foster and Thad Jones, among others. Recording with British musicians, he led several sessions in London in 1955-1957. Also in London, he recorded what became his first Blue Note album, Blues in Trinity (1958). Donald Byrd and Art Taylor were his sidemen. Gaining praise from Miles Davis and Sonny Rollins, the trumpeter settled in New York City in 1959 and recorded with several of Davis' bandmates, but found New York in the 1960s a struggle. Reece recorded other records for the Blue Note label, which were reissued by Mosaic in 2004. Still active as a musician and writer, Reece has recorded over the years with Hank Mobley, Wynton Kelly, Paul Chambers, Ronnie Scott, Phil Seaman, Victor Feldman, Tubby Hayes, Paris Reunion Band, Clifford Jordan‚Äôs Big Band, tenor saxophonist Dexter Gordon, fellow trumpeter Ted Curson, pianist Duke Jordan, long-time Sun Ra alumni saxophonist John Gilmore, and drummers Philly Joe Jones and Art Taylor. Reece wrote the music for the 1958 Ealing Studios film, Nowhere to Go.

Virginia, 518 U.S. 515 (1996), is a landmark case in which the Supreme Court of the United States struck down the long-standing male-only admission policy of the Virginia Military Institute (VMI) in a 7‚Äì1 decision. Justice Clarence Thomas, whose son was enrolled at VMI at the time, recused himself.  Majority decision  Writing for the majority, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg stated that because VMI failed to show \\"exceedingly persuasive justification\\" for its sex-based admissions policy, it violated the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. In an attempt to satisfy equal protection requirements, the state of Virginia had proposed a parallel program for women, called the Virginia Women's Institute for Leadership (VWIL), located at Mary Baldwin College, a private liberal arts women's college. However, Justice Ginsburg found that the VWIL would not provide women with the same type of rigorous military training, facilities, courses, faculty, financial opportunities, and/or alumni reputation and connections that VMI affords male cadets, a decision evocative of Sweatt v. Painter, when the Court ruled in 1950 that segregated law schools in Texas were unconstitutional, since a newly formed black law school clearly did not provide the same benefits to its students as the state's prestigious and long-maintained white law school. In her opinion, she stated that \\"The VWIL program is a pale shadow of VMI in terms of the range of curricular choices and faculty stature, funding, prestige, alumni support and influence.\\" = Rehnquist concurrence = Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote a concurrence agreeing to strike down the male-only admissions policy of the Virginia Military Institute, as violative of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. However, he declined to join the majority opinion's basis for using the Fourteenth Amendment, writing: \\"Had Virginia made a genuine effort to devote comparable public resources to a facility for women, and followed through on such a plan, it might well have avoided an equal protection violation.\\" This rationale supported separate but equal facilities separated on the basis of sex: \\"it is not the 'exclusion of women' that violates the Equal Protection Clause, but the maintenance of an all-men school without providing any‚Äîmuch less a comparable‚Äîinstitution for women ... It would be a sufficient remedy, I think, if the two institutions offered the same quality of education and were of the same overall caliber.\\" =Scalia dissent= Justice Scalia's lone dissent argued that the standard applied by the majority was closer to a strict scrutiny standard than the intermediate scrutiny standard applied to previous cases involving equal protection based on sex. Notably, however, the opinion for the Court eschewed either standard; its language did not comport with the \\"important governmental interest\\" formula used in prior intermediate scrutiny cases. Scalia argued that \\"if the question of the applicable standard of review for sex-based classifications were to be regarded as an appropriate subject for reconsideration, the stronger argument would be not for elevating the standard to strict scrutiny, but for reducing it to rational-basis review.\\" Scalia made sure to provide Ginsburg with a copy of his dissent as quickly as he could, in order for her to better respond to it in her majority opinion. Ginsburg later recalled that Scalia \\"absolutely ruined my weekend, but my opinion is ever so much better because of his stinging dissent\\". Aftermath With the VMI decision, the high court effectively struck down any law which, as Justice Ginsburg wrote, \\"denies to women, simply because they are women, full citizenship stature -- equal opportunity to aspire, achieve, participate in and contribute to society.\\" Following the ruling, VMI contemplated going private to exempt itself from the 14th Amendment, and thus this ruling. The Department of Defense warned the school that it would withdraw all ROTC programs from the school if this privatization took place. As a result of the DOD action, Congress amended , to prohibit the military from withdrawing or diminishing any ROTC program at one of the six senior military colleges, including VMI. However, VMI's Board of Visitors had already voted 9‚Äì8 to admit women and did not revisit the issue after the law was amended. VMI was the last all-male public university in the United States. United States v. Virginia is now a seminal case discussed in most Constitutional Law classes, which most students take during their first year of law school.

Note that iodometry involves indirect titration of iodine liberated by reaction with the analyte, whereas iodimetry involves direct titration using iodine as the titrant. Redox titration using sodium thiosulphate, Na2S2O3 (usually) as a reducing agent is known as iodometric titration since it is used specifically to titrate iodine. The iodometric titration is a general method to determine the concentration of an oxidising agent in solution. In an iodometric titration, a starch solution is used as an indicator since it can absorb the I2 that is released. This absorption will cause the solution to change its colour from deep blue to light yellow when titrated with standardised thiosulfate solution. This indicates the end point of the titration. Iodometry is commonly used to analyze the concentration of oxidizing agents in water samples, such as oxygen saturation in ecological studies or active chlorine in swimming pool water analysis. Color of iodometric titration mixture before (left) and after (right) the end point Basic principles Dilute solutions containing iodine- starch complex. Using starch as an indicator can help create a sharper color change at the endpoint (Dark blue‚ÜíColorless). The color above can be seen just before the endpoint is reached. To a known volume of sample, an excess but known amount of iodide is added, which the oxidizing agent then oxidizes to iodine. Iodine dissolves in the iodide-containing solution to give triiodide ions, which have a dark brown color. The triiodide ion solution is then titrated against standard thiosulfate solution to give iodide again using starch indicator: : I3‚àí \\\\+ 2 e‚àí ‚áå 3 I‚àí (Eo = + 0.5355 V) Together with reduction potential of thiosulfate: : S4O62‚àí \\\\+ 2 e‚àí ‚áå 2 S2O32‚àí (Eo = + 0.08 V) The overall reaction is thus: : I3‚àí \\\\+ 2 S2O32‚àí ‚Üí S4O62‚àí \\\\+ 3 I‚àí (Ereaction = + 0.4555 V) For simplicity, the equations will usually be written in terms of aqueous molecular iodine rather than the triiodide ion, as the iodide ion did not participate in the reaction in terms of mole ratio analysis. The disappearance of the deep blue color is, due to the decomposition of the iodine-starch clathrate, marks the end point. The reducing agent used does not necessarily need to be thiosulfate; stannous chloride, sulfites, sulfides, arsenic(III), and antimony(III) salts are commonly used alternatives. at higher pH (> 8)). At low pH, the following reaction might occur with thiosulfate: :S2O32‚àí \\\\+ 2 H+ ‚Üí SO2 \\\\+ S + H2O Some reactions involving certain reductants are reversible at certain pH, thus the pH of the sample solution should be carefully adjusted before the performing the analysis. For example, the reaction: : H3AsO3 \\\\+ I2 \\\\+ H2O ‚Üí H3AsO4 \\\\+ 2 H+ \\\\+ 2 I‚àí is reversible at pH < 4\\\\. The volatility of iodine is also a source of error for the titration, this can be effectively prevented by ensuring an excess iodide is present and cooling the titration mixture. Strong light, nitrite and copper ions catalyzes the conversion of iodide to iodine, so these should be removed prior to the addition of iodide to the sample. For prolonged titrations, it is advised to add dry ice to the titration mixture to displace air from the erlenmeyer flask so as to prevent the aerial oxidation of iodide to iodine. Standard iodine solution is prepared from potassium iodate and potassium iodide, which are both primary standards): :IO3‚àí \\\\+ 8 I‚àí \\\\+ 6 H+ ‚Üí 3 I3‚àí \\\\+ 3 H2O Iodine in organic solvents, such as diethyl ether and carbon tetrachloride, may be titrated against sodium thiosulfate dissolved in acetone. Iodine standard solution, sealed in an ampoule for iodometric analysis Applications Iodometry in its many variations is extremely useful in volumetric analysis. Examples include the determination of copper(II), chlorate, Hydrogen peroxide, and dissolved oxygen: :2 Cu2+ \\\\+ 4 I‚àí ‚Üí 2 CuI + I2 : 6 H+ \\\\+ ClO3‚àí \\\\+ 6 I‚àí ‚Üí 3 I2 \\\\+ Cl‚àí \\\\+ 3 H2O : 2 H+ \\\\+ H2O2 \\\\+ 2 I‚àí ‚Üí I2 \\\\+ 2 H2O : 2 H2O + 4 Mn(OH)2 \\\\+ O2 ‚Üí 4 Mn(OH)3 : 2 Mn3+ \\\\+ 2 I‚àí ‚Üí I2 \\\\+ 2 Mn2+ Available chlorine refers to chlorine liberated by the action of dilute acids on hypochlorite. Iodometry is commonly employed to determine the active amount of hypochlorite in bleach responsible for the bleaching action. In this method, excess but known amount of iodide is added to known volume of sample, in which only the active (electrophilic) can oxidize iodide to iodine. The iodine content and thus the active chlorine content can be determined with iodometry. The determination of arsenic(V) compounds is the reverse of the standardization of iodine solution with sodium arsenite, where a known and excess amount of iodide is added to the sample: : As2O5 \\\\+ 4 H+ \\\\+ 4 I‚àí ‚áå As2O3 \\\\+ 2 I2 \\\\+ 2 H2O For analysis of antimony(V) compounds, some tartaric acid is added to solubilize the antimony(III) product. =Determination of hydrogensulfites and sulfites= Sulfites and hydrogensulfites reduce iodine readily in acidic medium to iodide. Thus when a diluted but excess amount of standard iodine solution is added to known volume of sample, the sulfurous acid and sulfites present reduces iodine quantitatively: : SO32‚àí \\\\+ I2 \\\\+ H2O ‚Üí SO42‚àí \\\\+ 2 H+ \\\\+ 2 I‚àí : HSO3‚àí \\\\+ I2 \\\\+ H2O ‚Üí SO42‚àí \\\\+ 3 H+ \\\\+ 2 I‚àí =Determination of sulfides and hydrogensulfides= Although the sulfide content in sample can be determined straight forwardly as described for sulfites, the results are often poor and inaccurate. A better, alternative method with higher accuracy is available, which involves the addition of excess but known volume of standard sodium arsenite solution to the sample, during which arsenic trisulfide is precipitated: : As2O3 \\\\+ 3 H2S ‚Üí As2S3 \\\\+ 3 H2O The excess arsenic trioxide is then determined by titrating against standard iodine solution using starch indicator. Note that for the best results, the sulfide solution must be dilute with the sulfide concentration not greater than 0.01 M. =Determination of hexacyanoferrate(III)= When iodide is added to a solution of hexacyanoferrate(III), the following equilibrium exists: : 2 [Fe(CN)6]3‚àí \\\\+ 2 I‚àí ‚áå 2 [Fe(CN)6]4‚àí \\\\+ I2 Under strongly acidic solution, the above equilibrium lies far to the right hand side, but is reversed in almost neutral solution. This makes analysis of hexacyanoferrate (III) troublesome as the iodide and thiosulfate decomposes in strongly acidic medium. To drive the reaction to completion, an excess amount of zinc salt can be added to the reaction mixture containing potassium ions, which precipitates the hexacyanoferrate(II) ion quantitatively: : 2 [Fe(CN)6]3‚àí \\\\+ 2 I‚àí \\\\+ 2 K+ \\\\+ 2 Zn2+ ‚Üí 2 KZn[Fe(CN)6] + I2 The precipitation occurs in slightly acidic medium, thus avoids the problem of decomposition of iodide and thiosulfate in strongly acidic medium, and the hexacyanoferrate(III) can be determined by iodometry as usual.

It was purchased amid controversy by the National Gallery of Australia in 1973 and today remains one of the gallery's major paintings. Title At the time of the painting's creation, Pollock preferred not to assign names to his works, but rather numbers; hence, the original title of the painting was simply Number 11 or No. 11 for the year 1952. In 1954, the new title Blue Poles was first seen at an exhibition at the Sidney Janis Gallery and reportedly originated from Pollock himself.Lloyd, Michael and Michael Desmond. Blue Poles. National Gallery of Australia. Excerpted from European and American Paintings and Sculptures 1870‚Äì1970 in the Australian National Gallery by M. Lloyd and M. Desmond, 1992.

Because we look for the poles and miss much of the rest, the name is simply too distracting.\\" History=1973: National Gallery of Australia purchase= The National Gallery of Australia (NGA) purchased Blue Poles in 1973 for . The gallery's director at the time, James Mollison, was not able to authorise purchases over $1 million, so the acquisition was approved by Prime Minister Gough Whitlam who decided that the price should be made public. The purchase elicited a great deal of public discussion; according to art historian Patrick McCaughey, \\"never had such a picture moved and disturbed the Australian public\\".Simon Knell, National Galleries, Routledge, 2016, p. 55, The debate centred on the painting's record selling price, at the time a world record for a contemporary American painting, as well as the perceived financial ineptitude of Whitlam's Labor Party government and debate over the relative value of abstract art. In the conservative climate of the time, the purchase created a political and media scandal. =1998‚Äì1999: Museum of Modern Art retrospective= In 1998, Blue Poles left Australia for the first time since its purchase for inclusion in a Pollock retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in New York which ran from 1 November 1998 to 2 February 1999. The painting was the signature work of the exhibition, and as described in a review, it \\"dominated\\" the last gallery of the show, ending it \\"not with a whimper, but a bang\\". =2016‚Äì2017: Royal Academy of Arts Abstract Expressionism exhibition= While rarely loaned, the work was displayed as part of the Royal Academy's Abstract Expressionism exhibition from 24 September 2016 to 2 January 2017 in London,Royal Academy of Arts. before returning to the NGA and being rehung in level 2. =2020 Conservation project= As a result of the gallery's temporary closure due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it became possible to undertake an extensive conservation project of Blue Poles, a work that has rarely been off display since its purchase in 1973. Legacy The painting has become one of the most popular exhibits in the gallery, for both its value as a major work of 1950s abstract expressionism, and its significance in Australian politics and history. Estimates of the painting's present value vary widely, from $100 million to $350 million, but its increased value has at least shown it to have been a worthwhile purchase from a financial point of view.

It was written and performed entirely by Roger Waters. The song features his lyrics accompanied by an acoustic guitar played by Waters himself, while a tape loop of a skylark chirps in the background throughout the entire song. At approximately 4:13, the sound of a honking goose is temporarily introduced, followed by the sound of it taking off. As the instrumental track fades out, an incessant buzzing bee which has been heard throughout the song is chased after by an unidentified person (represented by the sound of footsteps) and finally swatted, cutting abruptly to the next track.

A live version of the song was released as the first single to promote The Early Years 1965‚Äì1972 box set in 2016. Lyrics The lyrics describe a pastoral and dream-like scene at the Grantchester Meadows in Cambridgeshire, close to where fellow band member David Gilmour lived at the time. This type of pastoral ballad was typical of Roger Waters' compositional approach in the late sixties and early seventies.

Their origin is at the inferior margin of the inguinal ligaments and they terminate when they join the internal iliac veins (to form the common iliac veins). Both external iliac veins are accompanied along their course by external iliac arteries. Structure A continuation of the femoral vein, the external iliac vein starts at the level of the inguinal ligament. It runs beside its corresponding artery and along the brim of the lesser pelvis to unite with the internal iliac vein anterior to the sacroiliac joint where it forms the common iliac vein. The left external iliac vein remains medial to the artery along its whole path. The right external iliac vein is medial to the artery, but as it ascends, it runs posterior to it. The external iliac vein is crossed by the ureter and internal iliac artery which both extend towards the middle. In males it is crossed by the vas deferens and in females the round ligament and ovarian vessels cross it. Psoas major lies to its side, except where the artery intervenes. The external iliac vein may have one valve, but often has no valves. In addition to pubic veins, the main tributaries of the external iliac veins are the inferior epigastric veins and the deep circumflex iliac vein. Clinical significance and history In 1967, Cockett noted anatomical variations which predisposed to compression of the external iliac vein, amongst other veins. Although less common than May- Thurner syndrome, it is being progressively documented due to modern imaging methods. Compression of the left external iliac vein by the right common iliac artery or left hypogastric artery can occur as it crosses over the vein into the pelvis. The right external iliac vein can similarly be compressed. Such compressions may contribute to deep vein thrombosis.

Life and career Rapha√´l Confiant was born in Le Lorrain, Martinique. He studied English and political science at the Sciences Po Aix and law at Paul C√©zanne University in Aix-en- Provence, France. During the 1970s, Confiant became a militant proponent of use of the Creole language and later worked with Jean Bernab√© and Patrick Chamoiseau to create the cr√©olit√© movement. The three authors co-authored the seminal text of the cr√©olit√© movement, Eloge de la cr√©olit√© (In Praise of Creoleness, 1989), in addition to other theoretical texts. The cr√©olit√© movement is often characterized as a reaction to the N√©gritude movement, which emphasized the African origins of the Antillean people. The cr√©olit√© movement, on the other hand, emphasizes the diversity of Antillean ancestry and cultural heritage, which includes Chinese, Indian, and European influences, among others. The movement seeks to understand the diverse identities and histories of the people of the Antilles through the lens of literature and language and eschews the universal in favor of a diverse view of language and identity. Confiant is a well-known writer in both Creole and French and is currently a lecturer at the University of the French West Indies and Guiana (UAG). After publishing his first novels in Creole and suffering very poor sales, Confiant took another approach in 1988 by publishing his first French-language novel, Le N√®gre et l'Amiral, set in Martinique during World War II. The novel was welcomed by the French literary crowd as a new voice in French-language literature. Narrowly missing the Goncourt Prize in 1991 with his second French novel, Eau de Caf√©, Confiant has ever since continued writing in French, even translating his first Creole-language novels. The themes of his last novels seem to be dictated by the anniversaries of French West Indian events like the 1902 Mount Pel√©e eruption (with Nu√©e Ardente, published in 2002) or the 1854 arrival of East-Indian indentured servants (La Panse du Chacal, 2004).

The film had a screenplay written by Akira Murao and Okamoto, and is based on the story Torideyama no jushichinichi () in Yamamoto Shugoro zenshu (1964) by Sh≈´gor≈ç Yamamoto.  Plot  Tatsuya Nakadai stars as Genta, a former samurai who became disillusioned with the samurai lifestyle and left it behind to become a wandering yakuza gang member. He meets Hanjir≈ç Tabata (Etsushi Takahashi) a farmer who wants to become a samurai to escape his powerless existence. Genta and Tabata wind up on opposite sides of clan intrigue when seven members of a local clan assassinate their chancellor. Although the seven, led by Tetsutar≈ç Oikawa (Naoko Kubo) rebelled with the support of their superior, Ayuzawa (Shigeru K≈çyama), he turns on them and sends members of the clan to kill them as outlaws. Style The film is a comically exaggerated exploration of what it is to be a samurai. The characters either give up samurai status or fight to attain it, and samurai are seen behaving both honorably and very badly. The film has a parodic tone, with numerous references to earlier samurai films.

The team continues to hold the North American record for the women's sports team with the best winning percentage. The Grads won the first women's world title in basketball in 1924. Team history=Origins= In 1912, 25-year-old teacher John Percy Page had moved from Ontario to Edmonton, Alberta, where he was employed by local high schools to organize commercial classes. Page soon taught commercial classes at the newly established McDougall High School. When Page decided to organize basketball teams for the school, his teaching assistant chose to coach the boys team, while Page coached the girls. Despite having only a basic knowledge of basketball, Page improved his understanding of the sport through study. He held practices twice-weekly. The high school had no gym, so students practiced basketball on an outdoor court throughout the year, even during frigid winter weather. Beginning their first year of competitive play in 1914, the McDougall High School girls team won a local high school tournament. Upon graduation from McDougall High School in mid-1915, the team members decided they wanted to continue playing basketball, establishing what eventually became the Commercial Graduates Basketball Club. Their new basketball team was called the Commercial Graduates (known informally as \\"the Grads\\"). Page remained coach for the team. Members were recruited primarily from McDougall High School students and graduates, but also from other business and technical schools. Page also established a feeder system to train and recruit his new players: promising high school students were invited to join a secondary team called the Gradettes, and the best Gradettes were promoted to the Grads whenever a space opened up. =Early years= In 1915, the Grads defeated women's basketball teams across Alberta to become provincial champions. Teams were allowed to challenge the title holders to a match at any time during the year‚Äîwith a three-month wait between rematches, if defeated‚Äîand the Grads successfully held on to their trophy for the next several years. In 1917, with a growing reputation for beating all challengers, the Grads retained their provincial champion status without needing to defend it once. On April 27, 1919, the University of Alberta Varsity team challenged the Grads, winning the match by two points and taking the trophy. In November of that year, the Grads had a rematch and successfully regained their title as provincial champions. The University of Alberta challenged the Grads again in April 1920 and lost the match, but immediately demanded another game, complaining that the Grads had improperly allowed a younger high-school-aged player on their team. After another game, the Grads lost the title to their rivals once more. =North American Underwood Trophy= In 1923, Canadian and American women's basketball champion teams competed for the first international Underwood Trophy. The Edmonton Grads faced off against the Cleveland Favorite-Knits and defeated them with a two-game score of 53‚Äì33, becoming the inaugural Underwood Trophy winners. The Edmonton Grads in 1923, winners of the first Underwood International Trophy =Olympic games= The Grads retained their amateur status to make sure they would be eligible for the Olympics if basketball was made an official Olympic sport. In 1924, the Grads were invited to play at the summer Olympic games in Paris. They won every game, defeating women's teams from Paris, Roubaix, Strasbourg and Lille with an average score of 60‚Äì10. After their final match, the team traveled through Europe on holiday. Page and two of his players ‚Äî Winnie Martin and Daisy Johnson ‚Äî returned to Paris for the third congress of the F√©d√©ration Sportive F√©minine Internationale (International Women's Sports Federation). The federation formally admitted Canada as a member and declared the Grads world basketball champions, permitting the team to hold the title until the next world games. Returning home as world champions, the Grads gained new sponsors and financial support in Canada. Page secured the Edmonton Arena as a permanent home venue for the team. Although the Grads were hopeful of returning to Europe for the Women's World Games of 1926, basketball was not included at that year's event, and the Grads remained in North America to compete against Canadian and American teams. Over the next two years, the Grads advocated for the inclusion of basketball ‚Äî both men's and women's ‚Äî as a sport at the 1928 Summer Olympics. Despite support from the Canadian Olympic Committee, this request was denied by the International Olympic Committee, and basketball did not receive a place on the program. However, the F√©d√©ration Sportive F√©minine Internationale had organized a European women's basketball tour in cooperation with the Olympics, and the federation invited the Grads to travel to Amsterdam, Netherlands, to defend their world title. After winning the Canadian women's championship of 1928, the Grads arrived in Europe and played nine matches. They won every match, beating most teams by 60 or 70 points, and the Grads finished their tour by defeating the French champions by 46‚Äì14. In addition to dominating their sport in North America, the Grads also took on the best teams in Europe, ultimately defeating challengers in Paris, London, Amsterdam, and Berlin. The Grads swept four consecutive Olympic Games from 1924 to 1936, winning all 24 Olympic matches they played. This achievement was unrecognized on the medal podium, however, as women's basketball did not become an official Olympic sport until the 1976 summer games in Montreal. =Disbandment= In 1940, the Royal Canadian Air Force took over the Edmonton Arena for wartime use, depriving the Grads of a local space in which to play against international teams. The commencement of World War II disrupted regular basketball competition throughout Europe and beyond, causing the cancellation of tournaments and championships and making it increasingly difficult for sports teams to travel. Additionally, despite Page's continuous efforts to find suitable competition over the years, no team had ever proven themselves consistently good enough to be a clear rival for the Grads. The Grads' dominance in basketball no longer attracted the same attention it had before, and regular game attendance had been shrinking. In May 1940, the Grads won their last Canadian championship before disbanding. Dr. James Naismith, the inventor of basketball, called the Grads the \\"finest basketball team that ever stepped out on a floor.\\" Some Grads players went on to join other Canadian basketball teams, such as the Comets and the Hedlunds. The Grads continued to stay in touch with each other after disbandment, meeting for reunions every four years. In 1961, the Grads decided to form an official organization to help them stay connected and answer public inquiries about the team. They established the Edmonton Grads Club, beginning to collect and preserve archive material and memorabilia, and the group continued to hold official reunions until 1987. On July 23, 2018, the last surviving member of the Grads, Kay MacBeth, died at the age of 96. Head coach Page encouraged his players to \\"play basketball, think basketball, and dream basketball.\\" He put firm emphasis on the moral behavior of his team, insisting that the Grads strive for a clean game at all times. During road trips, Page enforced a curfew, and players were discouraged from drinking or smoking. He was described by his players as \\"a nice man and a wonderful gentleman\\". After the team disbanded in 1940, Page was subsequently elected to the Alberta legislature, where he served as a politician until 1959. In late 1959, at the age of 72, Page became lieutenant-governor of Alberta. He held the position until 1966. Page died in 1973, due to complications of pneumonia. Record Official records have traditionally stated that the Grads played a total of 522 official games between 1915 and 1940, with 502 wins and 20 losses. This gives the team an overall win-loss percentage of 96.2%. Biographer M. Ann Hall has suggested that this total number of games played (522) may be incorrect, partially because official record-keeping of the Grads' games only began to be taken seriously after their national championship win in 1922. Based on her research, Hall proposes that the Grads played a total of 412 games, with 392 wins and 20 losses. This approach would affect the team's winning percentage only slightly (95.1%). Legacy The final Edmonton Grads roster, joined by former players, photographed July 3, 1940 As the most successful women's basketball team of the early 20th century, the Edmonton Grads made news headlines across North America and as far away as Hong Kong and the Philippines. Their success had a strong impact on public attitudes towards female athletes, making it more socially acceptable for women to play sports. The Grads National Basketball Championship in 1932 was essential to the Edmonton Rustlers women's hockey team, helping them gain support to travel east and play the Preston Rivulettes for the national hockey title. When the Canadian Press polled sportscasters and sports editors across the country in 1950, the Grads were voted Canada's greatest basketball team of the first half of the 20th century. In 1976 the Grads' success was designated a National Historic Event. Two years later, Parks Canada dedicated a plaque in the team's honor. In 1983, the Canada Basketball Hall of Fame inducted the entire team roster of 38 players. In 1987, the National Film Board released a documentary about the team entitled Shooting Stars. In the late 1980s, the city of Edmonton established Edmonton Grads Park in Westmount, installing a permanent historical display. In 2010, the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame in Knoxville, Tennessee, commemorated the Grads with an honorary plaque. In 2014, Canada Basketball launched its first Edmonton Grads International Classic event, named in honour of the Grads. Taking place every two years, this event has pitted the Canada women's national basketball team against teams from Brazil, China and Turkey. A non-profit organization called the Edmonton Grads Basketball Centre currently operates out of the Saville Centre in Edmonton, where they offer summer basketball programs for girls. In 2015, a mural dedicated to the Grads was unveiled at the Saville Centre, and the board of governors of the Edmonton Grads Basketball Centre announced they would begin awarding an annual Commercial Grads scholarship to members of the University of Alberta Pandas women's basketball team. The Grads were inducted into the Canada Sports Hall of Fame in 2017. That same year, Historica Canada released a Heritage Minute clip about the team for International Women's Day. On November 9, 2019, the Grads were featured in a Google Doodle celebrating the team.

It brought down the government of Prime Minister Wakatsuki Reijir≈ç and led to the domination of the zaibatsu over the Japanese banking industry. The Sh≈çwa Financial Crisis occurred after the post‚ÄìWorld War I business boom in Japan. Many companies invested heavily in increased production capacity in what proved to be an economic bubble. The post-1920 economic slowdown and the Great Kant≈ç earthquake of 1923 caused an economic depression, which led to the failures of many businesses. The government intervened through the Bank of Japan by issuing discounted \\"earthquake bonds\\" to overextended banks. In January 1927, when the government proposed to redeem these bonds, rumor spread that the banks holding these bonds would go bankrupt. In the ensuing bank run, 37 banks throughout Japan (including the Bank of Taiwan), and the second-tier zaibatsu Suzuki Shoten, went under. Prime Minister Wakatsuki attempted to have an emergency decree issued to allow the Bank of Japan to extend emergency loans to save these banks, but his request was denied by the Privy Council and he was forced to resign. Wakatsuki was succeeded by Prime Minister Tanaka Giichi, who managed to control the situation with a three-week bank holiday and the issuance of emergency loans; however, as a result of the collapse of many smaller banks, the large financial branches of the five great zaibatsu houses were able to dominate Japanese finances until the end of World War II.

Connelly is best known for his first novel, Bringing Out the Dead, which was made into an eponymous film.  Biography  Connelly grew up in a working-class family in Warwick, New York. He dropped out of Colgate University and, before publishing his first novel, worked as a paramedic at St. Clare's Hospital in Hell's Kitchen, New York City, for nine years. He wrote in his spare time over that period, in a small flat in the Upper West Side and while living in Ireland and travelling in Eastern Europe for a considerable period. During this period Connelly was encouraged by a creative writing professor at Columbia University. Bringing Out the Dead (1998) is autobiographical in nature and follows the story of a paranoid, hollow-eyed paramedic who works the graveyard shift in Hell's Kitchen, the barrio bounding the phantasmagoria of Times Square. Having seen so much human suffering on the job, the main character of the book, Frank, has turned emotionally into himself, despondent to the point of becoming a drunk, his life a living hell. Bringing Out the Dead was an immediate bestseller on publication. It was soon optioned for $100,000 and eventually made its way to production as a major motion picture of the same name in 1999. Bringing Out the Dead was directed by Martin Scorsese and the screenplay was adapted by Paul Schrader. Though the film was a critical success, it fell short of box office expectations. His second novel, Crumbtown (2003), didn't sell as well as the first. Although the book's characters were the trademark down-and-out personalities of Connelly's debut novel, he was criticized for relying on well-trodden clich√©s.

The result is notable as one of the biggest upsets in the competition's history. Before the game, England were heavy favorites against a hastily assembled U.S. team, which was composed of part-time players. The game's only goal was scored by Haitian-born U.S. center forward Joe Gaetjens. This game and the U.S. team were profiled by author Geoffrey Douglas in his book The Game of Their Lives, which was made into a film of the same name (later renamed The Miracle Match). Background This was England's World Cup debut, the Football Association having boycotted the previous three tournaments owing to a dispute with FIFA over payments made to amateur players, which had been resolved four years earlier. England and the United States were both drawn in Group 2, along with Spain and Chile: under the rules of the competition only the group winner from this four-nation round-robin would progress to the final stage. Each team had played one previous match in the group, England having beaten Chile 2‚Äì0 and the United States losing 3‚Äì1 to Spain. At the time, the English had a reputation as the \\"Kings of Football\\", with a post-war record of 23 wins, 4 losses, and 3 draws. They had beaten the Italians 4‚Äì0 and the Portuguese 10‚Äì0 in Lisbon two weeks before that. In comparison, the Americans, despite having finished third in the inaugural 1930 World Cup, had lost their last seven international matches (including the 1934 World Cup and 1948 Summer Olympics) by the combined score of 45‚Äì2, including heavy losses to Italy (7‚Äì1), Norway (11‚Äì0) and Northern Ireland (5‚Äì0). The odds were 3‚Äì1 the English would win the Cup, and 500‚Äì1 for the U.S. The people from Belo Horizonte were eager to watch the English team, with 10,000 tickets sold along with 3,000 distributed to associates of , then-owners of the newly inaugurated Est√°dio Independ√™ncia. England had Stanley Matthews available, who was widely considered one of the best players in the world at the time, but he had not played with the English team in the three international matches before the World Cup (in fact, he had joined the team late, having been touring Canada as part of another group of English internationals). As such, the selection committee (consisting entirely of Arthur Drewry, then president of The Football League in England and later the president of FIFA) opted to stay with the team that had just defeated Chile. Matthews would be saved for later, supposedly more difficult, opponents. As there were no substitutes allowed in those days, Matthews watched the game with the other reserves. Incidentally, the England team which toured Canada beat the United States team preparing for the World Cup 1‚Äì0 at the Triborough Stadium in New York City on 19 June, 10 days before the World Cup match, courtesy of a Johnny Hancocks goal. The American team consisted of semi-professional players, most of whom had other jobs to support their families. Walter Bahr was a high school teacher, Frank Borghi drove a hearse for his uncle's funeral home and others worked as letter carriers or dishwashers. One player, Ben McLaughlin, had to withdraw from the tournament because he could not get time off work. The team had also been hastily assembled, and had only been able to train together once, and that was the day before they left for Brazil, which happened to be against the touring English team featuring Matthews. (Matthews did not play in that game, as he was injured.) Three players‚ÄîJoe Maca, Ed McIlvenny, and Joe Gaetjens, none of whom was a U.S. citizen‚Äîhad been added to the roster just before that game. \\"We have no chance,\\" recently appointed coach Bill Jeffrey told the press; he also declared his players \\"sheep ready to be slaughtered\\". The English Daily Express newspaper wrote: \\"It would be fair to give the U.S. three goals of a start.\\" Match=First half= Although Walter Bahr regularly served as captain for the United States, Ed McIlvenny was selected for the role for this particular match \\"because he was British\\". England won the toss and elected to kick off. Within ninety seconds, Stanley Mortensen sent a cross from the left wing to Roy Bentley, who let off a shot that was barely pushed aside by U.S. goalkeeper Frank Borghi. By the 12th minute, England had six clear shots on goal but could not convert, with two shots hitting the post, one just going over the top, and another brilliantly saved by Borghi. The U.S. struggled to move to the offense, and finally managed a shot on goal in the 25th minute, which was blocked by English goalkeeper Bert Williams. The English counterattacked with three successive clear shots at the goal in minutes 30, 31, and 32, but failed to score. Mortensen twice went over the crossbar, and Tom Finney's header to the top corner was tipped away by Borghi. In the 37th minute, Bahr took a long shot from 25 yards out, but as Williams moved to his right to intercept, Gaetjens dived headlong near the penalty spot, and grazed the ball enough to put it to the left of the English goalkeeper, whose momentum prevented him from changing direction, and into the back of the net. The crowd exploded as the U.S. improbably led 1‚Äì0. As the half drew to a close, Finney had a chance to equalize, but the whistle blew before he could shoot. The crowd, initially 10,000, increased as Brazilian locals heard radio coverage of the match. The spectators were mostly supporting the underdog Americans, cheering with Borghi's saves and the unsuccessful English attacks. According to Bahr, \\"The overwhelming majority was Brazilians, but they rooted for us the entire time. We didn't realize why until after. They [were] hoping we would beat England and that Brazil would not have to play England in the final game.\\" Some locals even jumped a short wall to enter the stadium through the playing field. =Second half= The U.S. played with renewed confidence as the second half opened, creating another scoring opportunity in the 54th minute. In the 59th minute England was awarded a direct free kick but Mortensen's shot was well saved by Borghi. But England began threatening again, and it was fifteen minutes before the Americans were able to get another shot. With eight minutes left, Charlie Colombo brought down Mortensen with an illegal tackle at the edge of the penalty area. England pleaded for a penalty kick, but the referee ruled it was outside the box. From Alf Ramsey's resulting free kick, Jimmy Mullen headed the ball for what he thought was a goal, but Borghi tipped it away at the last instant, and despite the protests of the English players, the referee ruled that the ball had not crossed the line and thus there was no goal. England did not threaten again, but the U.S. had one final chance in the 85th minute: Frank \\"Peewee\\" Wallace drew Williams out of position and fired a shot at the empty net, only to be denied by a sliding goal line clearance by Ramsey. =Details=Post-match=Remaining matches= Even after this loss, England could have kept their chances alive by winning their final pool match against Spain, a result which would have forced a play-off for the right to progress to the final stage of the competition. However, they were unable to do this, losing 1‚Äì0, and finishing the First Round with a record of 1‚Äì0‚Äì2. The U.S. also lost their next match 5‚Äì2, versus Chile, ending their 1950 World Cup run with a First Round record of 1‚Äì0‚Äì2. They would not qualify for the World Cup again until 1990, after which they began a streak of seven consecutive World Cup appearances (this streak ended when they failed to qualify for the 2018 tournament). Spain advanced to the four-team Final Round, finishing fourth. Uruguay won the 1950 World Cup. =Aftermath= John Souza, the U.S. inside right forward, was selected to the World Cup All-Star team by the Brazilian sports newspaper Mundo Esportivo, and remained the only U.S. player selected to a World Cup All-Star team until Claudio Reyna in 2002. Newspaper headlines in most World Cup nations trumpeted the shocking upset, except ironically in the United States and England. There was only one U.S. journalist at the World Cup: Dent McSkimming of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch; he could not persuade the newspaper to pay for the trip, and had taken time off work to cover the event. McSkimming's report of the match was one of the few to appear in a major U.S. newspaper; some other journals carried agency reports of the match. In England, newspapers at the time were generally small, and had only a few pages devoted to sports. Because the English cricket team happened to suffer their first-ever home defeat to the West Indies the very same day, that was the major story in many publications. The team's performance was nonetheless excoriated, with headlines such as \\"England Caned At Soccer Too\\" [i.e. in addition to cricket], and \\"The Last Straw ‚Äì U.S. Beat England In World Cup\\". Many newspapers repeated Arthur Drewry's statement that the defeat was \\"unbelievable\\". Legend has it that in publications that did report the World Cup match, so unexpected was the result that it was presumed that the 1‚Äì0 scoreline was a typing error and so it was reported that England had won on a scoreline of 10‚Äì0 or 10‚Äì1. However, historical newspapers online at The British Newspaper Archive show that the story is a myth. Afterwards, a number of books and newspapers in England suggested that the U.S. team had arrived \\"through Ellis Island\\", meaning that the team was made up of imported players. In actuality, eight of the starting eleven were U.S.-born, while the other three, Gaetjens, McIlvenny, and Maca, were not U.S. citizens, but had declared their intentions to gain citizenship (only Maca ultimately became a U.S. citizen in 1957), (subscription required) and according to the rules of the United States Soccer Federation at the time, were allowed to play. The U.S. was cleared of any wrongdoing by FIFA in a hearing on 2 December 1950. Of the eight U.S.-born starters, five were from St. Louis, Missouri. England's blue uniform, which had made its debut in this match, was never worn again. Walter Bahr erroneously stated that England has never had a blue uniform since then, but a blue road uniform was worn again in 1959 during a 1‚Äì4 loss to Peru. The 1950 loss was the first of several shock losses for the English team. In 1953, they were defeated 6‚Äì3 by the \\"Magical Magyars\\" of Hungary and in 1954, they lost again to Hungary 7‚Äì1. The result of these losses was a reorganization of English football that culminated in England winning the 1966 World Cup on home soil. There was little attention given to the match in the U.S. at the time, and that continued to be the case until the 1994 World Cup, which was hosted in the U.S., although Pariani, an Italian American, was interviewed by the Italian press in 1990 when Italy and England played against each other for third place. Geoffrey Douglas, a professor of English at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, was inspired by news articles in the build-up to the 1994 tournament, and wrote a book about the 1950 match, having interviewed the five surviving members of the U.S. team. Entitled The Game of Their Lives, in 2005 it was made into a film of the same name directed by David Anspaugh. Since then, the game has become known as \\"The Miracle Match\\", in reference to the Miracle on Ice from the 1980 Winter Olympics, in which the U.S. ice hockey team defeated the heavily favored Soviet Union. The United States and England did not play another World Cup match against each other until a first-round encounter in the 2010 FIFA World Cup, which ended in a 1‚Äì1 draw.

He succeeded his own brother, Rusticus of Cahors, as bishop of Cahors and governed the diocese, which flourished under his care, from 630 to 655. Didier's career, like that of his brothers, is an example of a church and a monastic system controlled by the ruling, landholding class that was closely linked to the Merovingian monarchy. \\"This was no innovation of this period, but rather represented a continuation of a state of affairs which had existed since late Roman and early Merovingian times\\".Lewis, Archibald R. \\"The Development of Southern French and Catalan Society, 718‚Äì1050\\", ch 1 Life Born in the oppidum of Albi about the year 580, to a father with the expressly Christian name of Salvius and a literate mother with the Frankish name Herchenfreda, Desiderius had two brothers, named Rusticus and Syagrius. The three boys were sent to the court of the Frankish king Clotaire II (584‚Äì629; from 613 sole sovereign), and with other boys of noble family received an excellent education at the Merovingian court-school. Rusticus assumed holy orders at an early age and became archdeacon in the town of Rodez before being appointed abbot of the palatine basilica of Clotaire, who at length appointed him bishop of Cahors, in Quercy. The second brother, Syagrius, after long service in the palace household of the Franks and long familiarity with Clotaire, was made comte d‚ÄôAlbi and exercised juridical authority as praefectus in the city of Marseille.Kirsch, Johann Peter. \\"St. Desiderius of Cahors.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 4. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 20 Feb. 2015 Desiderius combined a love of letters with a native Gallican eloquence, according to his Vita. While still adolescent he received the dignities of the royal household and turned his studies towards Roman (i.e. canon) law, with the result that a Roman gravity of demeanor tempered the gallic richness and brilliance of his discourse. Before long he was appointed treasurer to the king, an office that he retained under the new king, Dagobert I (629‚Äì639), whose confidant he was. After the death of Syagrius (629), he is said to have obtained also the prefectship of Marseilles, but this is not certain. Faithful to the admonitions of his pious mother, three of whose letters to him are mentioned in his Vita, Desiderius led at court the serious holy life of a monk, and administered his office with great fidelity. While at court he made the acquaintance of St. Arnoux, St Ouen, and St Eloi. In 630 his brother Rusticus, the Bishop of Cahors, was killed during a riot, whereupon the clergy and people of that city requested from the king Desiderius as his successor. By a letter of April 8, 630, Dagobert made known his consent, and Desiderius was consecrated Bishop of Cahors. With the other bishops of his time, many of them educated with him at the royal court, he maintained an active correspondence. He was a zealous promoter of monastic life and founded a monastery in the vicinity of Cahors, the church of which was dedicated to St. Amantius; later on the convent was called after its founder St G√©ry (i.e. Dierius, from Desiderius). He directed also a convent of women, as we see from a letter written by him to the Abbess Aspasia. Under him and with his support was likewise founded in his diocese the monastery of St. Peter of Moissac. Desiderius built three large basilicas in and near Cahors (St Maria, St Peter and St Julian) and an oratory in honor of St Martin. The finished style of his building was notable, not of vernacular materials of wood, wattle and thatch, but > in the manner of the ancients out of squared and hewn stones, not indeed in > our Gallican fashion, but just as a whole circuit of ancient walls is wont > to be built; thus from the foundations to the topmost pinnacle he completed > the work with squared stones' (quoted in Greenhalgh) He also built an > aqueduct to serve Cahors, and rebuilt the walls and towers (castella) that > protected the city, as well as the Castrum Mercurio in Cahors itself. His > actions show how much the bishop acted for the public good with the > authority of a count or of a patricius. Desiderius persuaded the nobles of > his diocese to endow churches and monasteries. By his testament (649‚Äì650) he endowed the cathedral, the churches, and the monasteries of his episcopal city with all his estates. While resident on his estates in the district of Albi he fell ill and died at his villa of Wistrilingo.Venables, Edmund. \\"Desiderius (12)\\", A Dictionary of Christian Biography, (William Smith, Henry Wace, eds.), J. Murray, 1877, p. 820 His body was carried to Cahors and interred in the church of St Amantius. A Vita of Desiderius has been composed around the late 8th century by an anonymous author, possibly a monk from Saint-G√©ry near Cahors, written on the basis of older documents.La vie de Saint Didier, √©v√™que de Cahors (630‚Äì655), ed. R. Poupardin, Paris 1900, p. ix. Appended to it is a collection of letters, some composed by himself and others addressed to him, as well as an account of miracles that took place at his tomb. His feast is celebrated on 15 November. \\"Last of the Ancient Romans\\" Anthyme Saint-Paul, in his Histoire monumentale de la France, nominated Didier as ‚Äúle dernier des Romains‚Äù (\\"the last of the Romans\\") because of his building activities as bishop. Didier's lifelong correspondence with other aristocrats that he befriended in his youth also represents the very end of ancient epistolography dating back to the Hellenistic period. Didier was fully educated in literary studies, grammar and Roman laws. His small literary circle clearly attempted to preserve Roman heritage and traditions going back to Vergil and Homer, and the ability to speak the language of the past was valued. But Didier and his circle were remarkably few in number, indicating that only a very few individuals were participating in 7th century literary society. His letter collection marks the end of an unbroken chain of not only literary style but also cultural and social connection that can be traced back to Cicero and before. Subsequent surviving letter collections from the late Merovingian and Carolingian periods lack a direct connection to any ancient models.

The road passes through agricultural land, before the Ohio state lines the road curves towards the southeast. SR 26 ends at the Ohio‚ÄìIndiana border, just outside of Fort Recovery, the roadway continues east into Ohio as State Route 119. History SR 26 was originally designated between Bloomington and Madison along approximately the modern alignment of SR 46 and SR 7. The highway ran between SR 22 in Bloomington and SR 40 in Madison, passing through Columbus. When the Indiana State Highway Commission renumber the state road system in 1926 in coordination with the creation of the United States Numbered Highway System, the SR 26 designated was moved north to its modern alignment. The modern SR 26 was designated on October 1, 1926 on a route that ran between Lafayette and Oakford, this route was previously known as SR 29. The modern route of SR 26 between the Indiana‚ÄìIllinois state line and US 41 was added between 1927 and 1928, as SR 22. During 1930 a state road was proposed between US 41 and Lafayette and between US 31 and SR 9. Also at this time a state road was proposed from Upland east to the Ohio‚ÄìIndiana state line. Between late 1930 and early 1932 the highway commission added SR 26 between US 31 and SR 9 to the state road system and the SR 22 designation west of US 41 was changed to SR 26. During this time frame SR 26 was added to the state road system between Hartford City and SR 67 and the modern route of SR 26 between the modern eastern end of SR 22 and Hartford City became part of SR 22. During 1932 the proposed route between Portland and the Ohio‚ÄìIndiana state line was commissioned as part of SR 26 and the small north‚Äìsouth segment of modern SR 26, southeast of Upland, was commissioned as part of SR 221. SR 26 proposed to be extended east from SR 9 to SR 221 between 1936 and 1937. The road was extended from SR 9 to Hartford City between late 1938 and early 1939. The entire road was paved between 1966 and 1967. SR 26 formerly passed through the campus of Purdue University in West Lafayette, where it was concurrent with State Street, and through Lafayette as South Street and Columbia Street. The segment of roadway between the US 231 junction in the west and Interstate 65 interchange in the east were relinquished to the cities of West Lafayette and Lafayette in December 2013; SR 26 is now discontinuous.

While the principle is fairly intuitive, it does not have a rigorous mathematical definition. John Wheeler (1990) on the practical application of Mach's principle to experiment (pp.232-233): :: \\"It is not necessary to enter into the mathematics of the theory to state its simple consequence ... Each mass has an \\"inertia-contributing\\" power, a voting power, equal to its mass, there, divided by the distance from there to here. \\" According to the general principle of relativity, rotation is a relative property, and a state of motion that a satellite senses as being \\"absolutely non-rotating\\" is a local state, dictated partly by the relative rotation of the background stars, but also partly by the rotation of the body that the satellite orbits. Applying the democratic principle, we can calculate the influence of these two rotations on the satellite by calculating the relative contributions of these two collections of massenergy to the background gravitational field strength at the satellite's location, and then weighting their contributions on the satellite's \\"sense of rotation\\" accordingly.

The neighborhood is bounded by 33rd Street to the west, 29th Street to the east, Lehigh Avenue to the north, and Oxford Street to the south. As of the 2000 census, the neighborhood had a population of 22,562. It is often associated with the historic house of the same name, Historic Strawberry Mansion, located adjacent to the neighborhood and generally thought to be the source of the community's name. In 2005, the 19121 zip code, which contains Strawberry Mansion, had a median home sale price of $47,900. This was an 85% increase, the largest of any zip code in Philadelphia, from the 2004 median sale price. Early History Formerly known as Summerville, the neighborhood takes its name from a house known as Strawberry Mansion, at one time housing a restaurant known for strawberries and cream. Strawberry Mansion was home to a number of Philadelphia's wealthiest families in the 19th Century. In 1880, The average home price was higher than 85% of the houses in Philadelphia. Jewish Community The Jewish community started in the late 1890s, as the community migrated from Northern Liberties and Fairmount. After the turn of the century, many Jews living in South Philadelphia moved to then greener neighborhoods of the city. The first synagogue in the neighborhood was Beth Israel, which moved in 1909 from Eighth and Jefferson to 32nd and Montgomery. In 1913, a real estate broker placed an ad in the Philadelphia Jewish Herald encouraging Jews to leave South Philadelphia's Jewish quarter and move to the ‚Äúfresh air‚Äù and ‚Äúbeautiful country landscape‚Äù of Strawberry Mansion. At its height, about one- fifth of the Jewish population in the city lived in the enclave between Lehigh and Oxford streets, and 29th and 33rd streets. The Jews built a community, and eventually left for Oxford Circle, Overbrook Park, and West Oak Lane-Mt. Airy. There were at least 21 synagogues in the neighborhood, built for the most part in the first quarter of the 20th century. By 2015, six of the buildings remained and had been transformed into churches. Since WWII The 1950s and 1960s brought an economic decline and urban decay. In 2000, the neighborhood had the lowest average home price in the city. Modern Strawberry Mansion has acquired a reputation as one of the most dangerous areas of Philadelphia. The neighborhood is quite large in area and in population and has been grossly neglected by police. However, as of 2005, the southern and western boundaries of Strawberry Mansion have shown signs of gentrification. Feeding off the mixed successes of neighbor Brewerytown to the south, artist lofts have been planned in derelict factories. Additionally, property values have risen dramatically on properties abutting Fairmount Park on the western boundary of Strawberry Mansion. A number of stately park-side homes in varying states of disrepair can be found in what was once one of the wealthiest areas in Philadelphia. Many structures have already been completely restored in an area that was ignored for decades, but crime continues to plague the area. Strawberry Mansion has also been home to horses and urban cowboys for generations. One local group, the Fletcher Street Urban Riding Club, provides activities and support to neighborhood children in the struggling area. A notable mural, \\"A Tribute to Urban Horsemen,\\" can be viewed from the community garden on Montgomery Avenue near 33rd st. In 2015 it was announced that public access would be restored to the perimeter of a fallow basin of the East Park Reservoir in the first phase of a program to expand youth programs within the park. Then-Mayor Michael Nutter was quoted in ceremony, \\"What's demonstrated here today is that Strawberry Mansion will become the melting pot of the City of Philadelphia.\\" Neighborhood residents eagerly await removal of the chain- link fence and barbed wire. The change is a significant expansion of the park side amenities afforded to neighborhood residents and the city, reflecting the wave of redevelopment in the area and renewed efforts to improve Fairmount Park. Cityscape and Population The community is bounded by Fairmount Park to the west, Lehigh Avenue to the north, Sedgley Avenue and the SEPTA rail tracks to the east, and Cecil B. Moore Avenue to the south. Bordering neighborhoods include Allegheny West to the north, Glenwood and Stanton to the east, and Brewerytown to the south. As of 2010, Strawberry Mansion was 94.3% black or African American, 2.3% white or European American, 1.6% Hispanic, 0.8% Asian, and 1% all other.\\"Philadelphia Neighborhoods and Place Names, Q-Z.\\" City of Philadelphia.

Many children, prior to the close, attended elementary, junior, and high school without leaving the building. Now the neighborhood school that feeds into SMHS is James G. Blaine at 30th and Berks.

Sataspes (who, according to Herodotus, was Xerxes I's cousin by his mother being Darius I's sister) had been condemned to death for kidnapping and raping Megabyzus's daughter. However his mother, Atossa, successfully convinced Xerxes to change the punishment to a more severe one - Sataspes was tasked to circumnavigate Africa. He took an Egyptian ship and crew, sailed through the Pillars of Hercules, and proceeded south for many months, but returned to Egypt without successfully completing his task. He claimed that at the farthest point he reached, he encountered a \\"dwarfish race, who wore a dress made from the palm tree\\", and that he was forced to return because his ship stopped and would not sail any further. Xerxes did not accept this excuse, and had him put to death. However, it has been suggested that Sataspes could have simply encountered the Benguela Current, which prevented him from sailing any farther.

It operated from 1956 to 1968. It was one of several trains to operate with the experimental General Motors Aerotrain, although this experiment was short- lived. After 1961 the train was known as the Las Vegas Holiday Special.  History  The Union Pacific introduced the City of Las Vegas on December 18, 1956. The service initially used General Motors' experimental Aerotrain trainset, but the Union Pacific ended their lease within a year due to maintenance and performance problems including needing a helper engine to climb Cajon Pass. The train continued with standard streamlined cars in UP's Armour Yellow paint, leaving Los Angeles in the morning and returning in the evening. On September 24, 1961 the name was changed to Las Vegas Holiday Special, when the consist and frequency were reduced. Service ended altogether on June 15, 1968. Equipment The GM Aerotrain included nine cars: three 40-seat coaches, a bar-lounge, a \\"Chuck Wagon\\" buffet, three more 40-seat coaches, a 36-seat coach. The Union Pacific replaced the Aerotrain with conventional equipment on September 15, 1957.

Its publisher is John Oakes and its editor-in-chief is Dale Peck. The Evergreen Review was founded by Barney Rosset, publisher of Grove Press. It existed in print from 1957 until 1973, and was re-launched online in 1998, and again in 2017. Its lasting impact can be seen in the March‚ÄìApril 1960 issue, which included work by Albert Camus, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Bertolt Brecht and LeRoi Jones, as well as Edward Albee's first play, The Zoo Story (1958). The Camus piece was a reprint of \\"Reflections on the Guillotine\\", first published in English in the Review in 1957 and reprinted on this occasion as the magazine's \\"contribution to the worldwide debate on the problem of capital punishment and, more specifically, the case of Caryl Whittier Chessman.\\" Writers The Evergreen Review debuted pivotal works by Samuel Beckett, Jorge Luis Borges, Charles Bukowski, William S. Burroughs, Marguerite Duras, Jean Genet, Allen Ginsberg, G√ºnter Grass, Jack Kerouac, Norman Mailer, Henry Miller, Pablo Neruda, Vladimir Nabokov, Frank O‚ÄôHara, Kenzabur≈ç ≈åe, Octavio Paz, Harold Pinter, Susan Sontag, Tom Stoppard, Derek Walcott and Malcolm X. United States Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas wrote a controversial piece for the magazine in 1969. Kerouac and Ginsberg regularly had their writing published in the magazine. Illustrators Although primarily a literary magazine, Evergreen Review always contained numerous illustrations. In its early years, these included a small number of cartoons. By the mid-1960s, many illustrations and photographs were of an erotic nature, including a serialized graphic novel, The Adventures of Phoebe Zeit-Geist by writer Michael O'Donoghue and artist Frank Springer. It was later published as a Grove Press hardcover in 1968 and trade paperback in 1969. Evergreen evolution Ken Jordan, writing in the introduction to the Evergreen Review Reader, 1957‚Äì1996, described the counter- cultural contents and the impact of the publication on readers: 230px :The first issue featured an essay by Jean-Paul Sartre and an interview with the great New Orleans jazz drummer Baby Dodds. It also included a story of Samuel Beckett's Dante and the Lobster, the first of his many appearances in the pages of Evergreen, which continued through to the last [print] issue published. :The second issue was a landmark. A banner across the cover declared \\"San Francisco Scene,\\" and inside held the first collection of work by the new Beat writers - including Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Gary Snyder, Michael McClure, Philip Whalen, Jack Kerouac (before the publication of On the Road) and Allen Ginsberg, whose Howl had already been published as a pamphlet by Ferlinghetti's press, City Lights, and was confiscated by customs officials and faced trial for obscenity in San Francisco. The issue brought the Beats and Evergreen Review to the forefront of the American stage... :Evergreen published writing that was literally counter to the culture, and if it was sexy, so much the better. In the context of the time, sex was politics, and the powers-that-be made the suppression of sexuality a political issue. The court battles that Grove Press fought for the legal publication of Lady Chatterly's Lover, Tropic of Cancer, and Naked Lunch, and for the legal distribution of the film I Am Curious: Yellow, spilled onto the pages of Evergreen Review, and in 1964, an issue of Evergreen itself was confiscated in New York State by the Nassau County District Attorney on obscenity charges... :All of this was done on a shoestring budget by a tiny staff. Barney Rosset started the magazine with editor Don Allen and Fred Jordan, who was nominally the business manager in its early days. Richard Seaver joined the editorial team with the ninth issue, and Don Allen stepped back to become a contributing editor. Publication increased from quarterly to bimonthly to, in the late sixties, monthly, and the format changed from trade paperback to a full-sized, glossy magazine attaining a subscription base of some 40,000 copies and a newsstand circulation of 100,000. The final print issue, number 96, came out in 1973.Jordan, Ken. Evergreen Review Reader, 1957‚Äì1996. Blue Moon Books, Arcade Publishing, 1994. Excerpt from the introduction. Online The original Evergreen Review ceased publication in 1973, but the magazine was revived in 1998 in an online edition edited by founder Barney Rosset and his wife Astrid Myers. The online magazine featured American lyric poets such as Dennis Nurkse and postcolonial authors such as Giannina Braschi.

Located on the East Lamma Channel off the coast of Wah Fu Estate and Cyberport at Telegraph Bay, it is named after the waterfall that flows into it. The fresh water from this waterfall is said to have given the city its name ‚Äì the translation of Hong Kong's name in Cantonese È¶ôÊ∏Ø means \\"fragrant harbour\\". An eponymous park is now situated around the area. Location Waterfall Bay is located in the Pok Fu Lam area, with the waterfall itself encompassed by Wah Fu Estate and the residential complex of Bel-Air on the Peak in Cyberport. ' Geographically, the bay forms part of the East Lamma Channel. ' The park surrounding the bay can be accessed by a road by the same name (Waterfall Bay Road), which is connected to Wah Fu Road. A trail at Waterfall Bay Park leads from a series of stairs down to a rocky/sandy area where the falls can be viewed from below. History=Pre-1841 British colonization= It is not known when Waterfall Bay was first discovered. The first English-language mention of Hong Kong or the waterfall was in Dr. Clark Abel's \\"Narrative of a Journey to China,\\" which recounted his 1816 travels with William Amherst on Amherst's failed mission to China. Lord Amherst used the bay as the rendezvous point for his ships before proceeding north. The visit produced the first engravings of the falls.https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=lRkRBwAAQBAJ&printsec;=frontcover&output;=reader&hl;=en&pg;=GBS.PA119 Fishermen working in the southern part of Hong Kong Island referred to Aberdeen Harbour as \\"Hong Kong\\", which translates to \\"fragrant harbour\\". This name is attributed to the fresh water that flowed into Waterfall Bay from its namesake natural feature. ' The waterfall became well-known among British and European sailors, who would refill their fresh water supplies directly from the falls on their journey towards other ports in Asia, such as Galle, Ceylon and Malacca. ' This brought about the city's reputation for its abundant supply of drinking water, one of the few places on the coast of China to have such a resource. As a result, the name derived from the waterfall was later utilized to refer to the entire island and Victoria Harbour. =Post-1841= Construction of the nearby Pok Fu Lam Reservoir‚Äîthe first key water storage facility in the colony‚Äîwas finished in 1863. In order to accomplish this, the streams flowing from the mountains that are the source of the waterfall were dammed. This greatly reduced the flow intensity of the waterfall. =Second World War= Due to the bay's strategic location overlooking the Lamma Channel, it was utilized by the British during the Second World War to defend the colony from the Japanese. A pillbox and searchlight‚Äîknown as a Lyon Light‚Äîwas constructed; ' the former served as a bunker for Allied soldiers during the Battle of Hong Kong. Now in ruins, they can still be accessed at low tide.

He was arrested at Narita Airport on 13 April 2002 and found guilty by the Chiba Prefecture District Court in June 2003. He was sentenced to 14 years' jail with forced labour and fined ¬•5,000,000. At his trial Baker claimed that he was tricked by his travelling companion, James Prunier, into carrying the drugs through customs in a false-bottomed suitcase. Baker also claimed that during his initial detention he was mistreated by Japanese authorities with sleep deprivation, no access to legal counsel, and that he was forced to sign a confession written in poor and inaccurate English. Baker's conviction was upheld on appeal but Baker's sentence was reduced to 11 years in prison and the fine to ¬•3,000,000. Baker was transferred back to England in the Spring of 2008 to serve the remainder of his sentence. After spending six-months at London's Wandsworth prison, Baker was released on licence in October 2008. Background and arrest Baker, a trained chef and former sandwich-shop manager, ran a fencing business in his home town of Stroud, Gloucestershire, where he lived with his fianc√©e and their baby son. Baker had met Prunier 3 years before through a mutual interest in football. Prunier had problems with depression, drug and alcohol abuse, and later admitted that he had been involved in criminal activities at this time. Baker said that Prunier and he, who had been travelling together in Europe, had decided to go to Japan before the 2002 FIFA World Cup to buy souvenirs and allow Prunier to rent a flat for the tournament. Baker and Prunier left Brussels National Airport in Belgium on 12 April, transited through London's Heathrow Airport and arrived at Tokyo's Narita airport at approximately 11:00 a.m. JST, on 13 April 2002. Baker claimed in a later statement that he had been drinking and was tired from the long flight. He reported that after Prunier and he were split-up at airport immigration, they had met up again at the baggage carousel, and Prunier had told him \\"I haven't seen your bag yet, Nick. You grab this and get in a queue and I'll join you when yours comes out.\\" When the bag Baker was carrying was searched in customs, 41,120 tablets of ecstasy and 992.5 grams of cocaine were found hidden in false compartments of the suitcase, the largest single illegal drugs haul at Narita airport at that time. Baker, who has a heavy regional accent, reported that he had told the customs officials, who had limited English language skills, that the case was Prunier's. According to the prosecution at his trial, Baker had the suitcase key in his possession, and threw it into the suitcase during the search. Prunier passed through customs, and although Japanese police monitored his mobile telephone conversations and his movements (including photographing his departure from Japan two days later), he was not detained or questioned. Initial detention As is customary in Japan, following his arrest Nick Baker was detained for 23 days and questioned without access to a lawyer. Baker reported that he was interrogated by as many as six police officers at any one time, shackled to a chair, with his hands tied behind his back. Baker claimed that throughout this period the lights were kept on so he could not sleep and that he did not eat for 20 days. Baker denied that the suitcase was his and claimed that Prunier had tricked him into carrying it through customs. However, at the end of the detention period, he signed a statement in Japanese that during the trial was seen as inconsistent and self-incriminating. Baroness Sarah Ludford, a member of the European Parliament and justice spokeswoman for the United Kingdom's Liberal Democratic Party, criticized the quality of the Japanese-English interpretation during the interrogation, and noted that Baker was required to sign a witness statement in Japanese, a language he did not understand. Baker later claimed that the police had told him that if he signed a statement he would be incriminating Prunier and that he would be allowed to return home. Baker was indicted on 1 May for violation of the Narcotic and Psychotropic Drug Control Law, and Customs Law. Baker's mother reported that his health had deteriorated during his detention including bleeding gums, a broken finger, daily headaches, severe depression, and extreme back pain caused by sitting on the concrete floor. Until the start of his trial ten months later, Baker was kept in solitary confinement for refusing to admit his guilt, and put on suicide watch because of depression. Chiba District Court trial The trial, which opened in February 2003, centred on whether Baker had been aware of the contents of the suitcase as well as an examination of the interrogation records and the confession he had signed. Baker claimed that the statement was mispresentation of his words and his lawyer, Shunji Miyake, argued that since there was no video or audio recording of the interrogations, and no defence lawyer was present, there was no way to check whether falsifications and mistranslations had taken place. Miyake also questioned what he claimed were the 'leading nature' of the questions asked by the interrogators. Baker maintained that the bag was Prunier's, that he had never had the key to the case, and that he had been tricked into carrying the bag by Prunier. Prunier had been arrested for drug smuggling in Belgium a month after Baker's arrest, and his co-accused in the Belgian case had also claimed that Prunier had duped them into carrying bags with drugs. The court ruled the evidence from the Belgian police was inadmissible, and it was not introduced during the trial. In June 2003, the presiding judge, Kenji Kadoya, who had never found a defendant innocent in a career spanning more than a decade, found Baker guilty. He said Baker must have known the contents of the case because he had carried the key and had told customs officials and prosecutors that the case belonged to him. The judge also noted a signed confession, which implied Baker knew he was carrying drugs in the bag. In the three-hour judgment, which was an almost word-for- word copy of the prosecution's argument, Kadoya said \\"This is a heinous crime. \\"This amount of drugs was a record. If they had entered our country, they would have harmed a large number of people.\\" In June 2003, Baker was sentenced to 14 years in prison with forced labour and a ¬•5,000,000 fine. Baker's lawyer said Baker had been punished more heavily because he had protested his innocence rather than confessing, which is the usual method by which prosecutors secure convictions. In August 2003, James Prunier was interviewed on Central TV about the case. He admitted to being involved in drug smuggling, but denied that he had framed Baker, claiming that Baker was aware of the contents of the case. He subsequently committed suicide in August 2004, while on bail for the Belgian case. Tokyo High Court appeal The High Court appeal began March 2004. The defence argued that poor translation during police interrogations and during the district court trial had affected the outcome of the trial and submitted expert testimony about translation errors. They also suggested that the investigation was improperly conducted, that there were inconsistencies in official reports, and that important evidence, such as the Belgian information, had been ignored at the original trial. On 27 October 2005 the presiding judge upheld the guilty verdict, rejecting defence suggestions. The judge questioned why Baker had travelled to Japan after Prunier had told him \\"If anything goes wrong on the way to Japan, your family will be killed.\\" He also noted that the drugs were very skillfully hidden, and that more than half of the contents of the suitcase belonged to Baker, suggesting that it belonged to him. The judge also commented that \\"the defendant has not reflected sincerely on his acts.\\" However, he reduced the sentence from 14 years to 11 years noting that Baker did not seem to be the mastermind, and his family had been worried about him. Baker's fine was also reduced from ¬•5,000,000 (approximately ¬£24,392) to ¬•3,000,000 (approximately ¬£14,635). This had to be paid within four weeks or he would have to serve an extra 150 days of hard labour. In November 2005, Baker decided not to appeal to Japan's Supreme Court and was transferred to Fuchu Prison to begin serving his sentence. Having served one third of his sentence, Nick Baker was transferred back to England in the spring of 2008 to serve the remainder of his sentence. After six months at London's Wandsworth prison he was released on licence in October 2008. Reactions In April 2003, Baker's mother Iris publicly stated her belief that Nick Baker was innocent and had been framed. She subsequently led a campaign against her son's allegedly unfair trial, for better prison treatment and more recently for a transfer back to a UK prison. Campaign actions including presenting a petition signed by more than 1,000 people, including several Members of European Parliament, to Tony Blair at 10 Downing Street. In July 2003, Lady Ludford called for Tony Blair to raise the issue during a summit with his Japanese counterpart Junichiro Koizumi though he did not do so. A question was raised in the British House of Commons in 2004 regarding progress of the case and Baker's health and confinement conditions. Mark Devlin, who at the time was the publisher of Metropolis, initially supported the Nick Baker campaign but withdrew his support in 2004 and publicly criticized the support group's campaign tactics. The International Bar Association cited problems specific to the Baker case, particularly the lack of any recordings of interrogations in a 2006 report.\\"Interrogation of Criminal Suspects in Japan\\" International Bar Association, December 2003 Fair Trials Abroad, director Stephen Jakobi said Baker's case raised major concerns regarding the Japanese justice system and its compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and pointed out Senrikinran University linguistics Professor Makiko Mizuno's criticism of the Japanese judiciary's understanding of what constitutes an able interpreter.

This aether drag hypothesis was an attempt by classical physics to explain stellar aberration and the Fizeau experiment, but was discarded when Albert Einstein introduced his theory of relativity. Despite this, the expression light-dragging has remained in use somewhat, as discussed on this page. Under special relativity's simplified model Einstein assumes that light-dragging effects do not occur, and that the speed of light is independent of the speed of the emitting body's motion. However, the special theory of relativity does not deal with particulate matter effects or gravitational effects, nor does it provide a complete relativistic description of acceleration. When more realistic assumptions are made (that real objects are composed of particulate matter, and have gravitational properties), under general relativity's more sophisticated model the resulting descriptions include light-dragging effects. Einstein's theory of special relativity provides the solution to the Fizeau Experiment, which demonstrates the effect termed Fresnel drag whereby the velocity of light is modified by travelling through a moving medium. Einstein showed how the velocity of light in a moving medium is calculated, in the velocity-addition formula of special relativity. Einstein's theory of general relativity provides the solution to the other light-dragging effects, whereby the velocity of light is modified by the motion or the rotation of nearby masses. These effects all have one property in common: they are all velocity-dependent effects, whether that velocity be straight-line motion (causing frame-dragging) or rotational motion (causing rotation-dragging). Velocity-dependent effects Special relativity predicts that the velocity of light is modified by travelling through a moving medium. * For a moving particulate body, light moving through the body's structure is known to move faster in the direction of the body's motion than it does in the opposite direction (Fizeau experiment). This effect was originally predicted by dragged-aether theories (see: e.g. Fresnel). Light aimed transversely through a moving transparent body is also seen to be translated in the direction of the body's motion (R.V. Jones, J.Phys A 4 L1-L3 (1971) ). General relativity predicts that the acceleration of a body in a straight line will cause light to drag, an effect known as Frame dragging (or gravitoelectromagnetism). * For a moving gravity-source the gravitational field can be considered as an extension of the object, and carries inertia and momentum - since a direct collision with the moving object can impart momentum to an external particle, interaction with the object's gravitational field should allow \\"momentum exchange\\" too. Consequently, a moving gravitational field drags light and matter. This general effect is used by NASA to accelerate space probes, using the gravitational slingshot effect. Rotation- dragging effects Under general relativity, the rotation of a body gives it an additional gravitational attraction due to its kinetic energy; and light is pulled around (to some degree) by the rotation (Lense‚ÄìThirring effect). * In the case of rotation, under general relativity we observe a velocity-dependent dragging effect, since, for a rotating body, the tendency of the object to pull things around with it can be accounted for by the fact that the receding part of the object is pulling more strongly than the approaching part.

Cranko received his early ballet training in Cape Town under the leading South African ballet teacher and director, Dulcie Howes, of the University of Cape Town Ballet School. In 1945 he choreographed his first work (using Stravinsky's Suite from L'Histoire du soldat) for the Cape Town Ballet Club.\\"John Cranko\\", Stuttgart Ballet, retrieved 19 March 2015 He then moved to London, studying with the Sadler's Wells Ballet School in 1946 Dromgoole, Nicholas. \\"John Cranko\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, retrieved 19 March 2015, and dancing his first role with the Sadler's Wells Ballet in November 1947.\\"John Cranko\\", Royal Opera House Performance Database, retrieved 19 March 2015 =London= Cranko collaborated with the designer John Piper on Sea Change, performed at the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin in July 1949.

Another collaboration with Mackerras followed in 1954 with The Lady and the Fool, to music by Verdi. In January 1954 Sadler's Wells Ballet announced that Cranko was collaborating with Benjamin Britten to create a ballet. Cranko devised a draft scenario for a work he originally called The Green Serpent, fusing elements drawn from King Lear, Beauty and the Beast (a story he had choreographed for Sadler's Wells in 1948) and the oriental tale published by Madame d'Aulnoy as Serpentin Vert. Creating a list of dances, simply describing the action and giving a total timing for each, he passed this to Britten and left him to compose what eventually became The Prince of the Pagodas.Reed, Cooke & Mitchell, pp. 258‚Äì260 Cranko wrote and developed a musical revue Cranks, which opened in London in December 1955, moved to a West End theatre the following March, and ran for 223 performances. With music by John Addison, its cast of four featured the singers Anthony Newley, Annie Ross, Hugh Bryant and the dancer Gilbert Vernon; it transferred to Broadway at the Bijou Theatre. An original cast CD has been released. Cranko followed the format of Cranks with a new revue New Cranks opening at the Lyric Theatre Hammersmith on 26 April 1960 with music by David Lee and a cast including Gillian Lynne, Carole Shelley and Bernard Cribbins, but it failed to have the same impact. In 1960, Cranko directed the first production of Benjamin Britten's opera A Midsummer Night's Dream, at the Aldeburgh Festival.\\"A New Midsummer Night's Dream\\", The Times, 11 June 1960, p. 11. When the work had its London premiere the following year at Covent Garden, Cranko was not invited to direct, and Sir John Gielgud was brought in.\\"London Triumph for Britten's Dream\\", The Times, 3 February 1961, p. 13 =Stuttgart= Prosecuted for homosexual activity, Cranko left the UK for Stuttgart, and in 1961 was appointed director of the Stuttgart Ballet, where he assembled a group of talented performers such as Marcia Hayd√©e, Egon Madsen, Richard Cragun, Birgit Keil and Suzanne Hanke. Among his following choreographies were Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare in 1962, set to music by Prokofiev, Onegin in 1965, an adaptation of the verse novel Eugene Onegin by Alexander Pushkin, set to music by Tchaikovsky (mainly The Seasons), orchestrated by Kurt-Heinz Stolze, The Taming of the Shrew by Shakespeare in 1969, Brouillards in 1970, Carmen in 1971 (music by Wolfgang Fortner and Wilfried Steinbrenner) and Spuren (Traces) in 1973. Cranko's work was a major contribution to the international success of German ballet beginning with a guest performance at the New York Metropolitan Opera in 1969. At Stuttgart, Cranko invited Kenneth MacMillan to work with the company, for whom MacMillan created four ballets in Cranko's lifetime and a fifth, Requiem, as a tribute after Cranko's death.Parry, pp. 711‚Äì716. At Cranko's instigation the company established its own ballet school in 1971; it was renamed the John Cranko Schule in his honour in 1974.\\"History\\" John Cranko Schule, retrieved 19 March 2015. His assistant and choreologist Georgette Tsinguirides preserved his works in Benesh Movement Notation. Cranko choked to death after suffering an allergic reaction to a sleeping pill he took during a transatlantic charter flight from Philadelphia to Stuttgart two days after the company completed a successful tour of the United States at the Academy of Music in Philadelphia. The flight made an emergency landing in Dublin where Cranko was pronounced dead upon arrival at a hospital. His mother, Grace, who was divorced from Herbert and lived in what was then Rhodesia, heard about his death from a radio broadcast. Cranko was buried at a small cemetery near Castle Solitude in Stuttgart. =Legacy= In 2007, the Stuttgart Ballet celebrated what would have been Cranko's 80th birthday with the Cranko Festival.\\"Das Stuttgarter Ballettwunder\\" , Arte, retrieved 19 March 2015.

Frodus Conglomerate International, Frodus Sound Laboratories, FCI, Frodus Escape Plan, Frodus Deposit Insurance Corporation) was an American post-hardcore band formed in 1993 in Washington, D.C. by vocalist/guitarist Shelby Cinca and drummer Jason Hamacher. The band went through numerous bassists over the course of their career. Their mixture of math rock and hardcore punk plus their lyrical themes, frequently dark and dissonant and seen as esoteric for the time, led them to be described by critics as one of the most influential post-hardcore bands of the 1990s.  Biography = Existence (1993-1999) = Frodus' first releases were self-distributed cassettes and 7 inches, such as Babe, Tzo-Boy, and Molotov Cocktail Party. Two other releases (Fireflies and F-Letter), on now defunct indie labels, followed. Frodus later signed with Tooth & Nail Records, an independent label out of Seattle, with whom they released Conglomerate International in 1998. Most of Frodus' recognition was due to their final release, And We Washed Our Weapons in the Sea, recorded in 1999 and released in 2001 on Fueled by Ramen, considered by band members to be their best recorded work. The name Frodus came from the last episode of TV series The Monkees called \\"Mijacogeo\\" (a.k.a. \\"The Frodis Caper\\"). = Post-breakup (2000-2008) = After Frodus broke up in 1999, it took two years to find a label to release their final album. The first label, MIA Records, shut down due to the owner (also a Texas oil-tycoon) having to settle a long-standing lawsuit. Afterwards, long-time Frodus friend Tony Weinbender (then of Fueled by Ramen Records) offered to release Frodus' final album. Shelby Cinca briefly joined the band Bluebird as a second guitarist following the breakup of Frodus, but left before recording any material with them. In 2000, Nathan went on to form The Out Circuit and Night Is Invisible (both of which released records on Lujo Records), and Hamacher went on to drum for Combatwoundedveteran. In 2003, the founding members Shelby Cinca and Jason Hamacher along with bassist Joe Lally of Fugazi joined to form The Black Sea. They later changed their name to Decahedron. Lally left shortly after the completion of their debut album and was replaced by Jonathan Ford (Unwed Sailor, Roadside Monument). Continually plagued by bassist fluctuation anomalies, Ford quit in 2004 and was later replaced by Jake Brown (Moments in Grace, Twothirtyeight). In 2005, they suspended operations after the release of their EP entitled 2005. Shelby Cinca then focused on his Swedish project Frantic Mantis with H√•kan Johansson and Per St√•lberg of Division of Laura Lee, and completed the third album by The Cassettes (Buddyhead Records, 2006). In 2006, Jason Hamacher started a project with Mike Schliebaum of Darkest Hour called Zealot. Cinca began releasing IDM, made on a Game Boy (Game Boy music) with the Nanoloop software, under his own name. 2006 also saw the relaunch of the Frodus web-presence and consolidation of its MySpace entities. The site is an ongoing project of archiving all known interviews, previous website designs, press clippings, and digital transfers for media content. Shelby Cinca also began remastering out-of-print releases and adding them to the iTunes library and other digital music services through his partnership with Carcrash Records. = Reunion (2009-2010) = 2009 saw Frodus reunite as the Frodus Escape Plan/Frodus Conglomerate International/FDIC (Frodus Despotic (or Deposit) Insurance Corporation) with Liam Wilson from The Dillinger Escape Plan on bass, and Jake Brown from Moments in Grace also on bass for select appearances. The reunion was organized in commemoration of the re-release of the Conglomerate International double-vinyl LP on Gilead Media, and as a statement in response to the bank-bailouts and the uncovering of corporate corruption in the financial sector.

Opera  In opera, a r√©p√©titeur is the person responsible for coaching singers and playing the piano for music and production rehearsals.Oxford English Dictionary, Oxford University Press, accessed 27 July 2010 When coaching solo singers or choir members, the r√©p√©titeur will take on a number of the roles of a vocal coach: advising singers on how to improve their pitch and pronunciation, and correcting note or phrasing errors. R√©p√©titeurs are skilled musicians who have strong sight-reading and score reading skills. In addition to being able to sight read piano parts, a r√©p√©titeur can play on the piano an orchestral score reducing it in real-time (orchestral reduction), by reading from a large open score of all of the instruments and voice parts. R√©p√©titeurs are also skilled in following the directions of a conductor, in terms of changing the tempo, pausing, or adding other nuances.  Ballet  In ballet, a r√©p√©titeur teaches the steps and interpretation of the roles to some or all of the company performing a dance. Several late 20th-century choreographers, such as George Balanchine, Jerome Robbins, Gerald Arpino and Twyla Tharp, have established trusts and appointed conservators‚Äîhand-picked dancers who have intimate knowledge of particular ballets‚Äîas r√©p√©titeurs of their works.

During his time at Lehigh, Perella was a member of Phi Kappa Theta, Fraternity for men. Following his sophomore year at Lehigh, Perella took several years off before returning and graduating from the university in 1964 with a degree in accounting. After serving in the United States Air Force and the New Jersey Air National Guard from 1964 to 1970, he attended and graduated from Harvard Business School in May 1972 with a Masters in Business Administration. Career In the fall of 1972, he was hired as an associate at First Boston, where he worked in the mergers and acquisitions department. He remained with First Boston until 1988 when he teamed up with associate Bruce Wasserstein to create their own mergers and acquisitions advisory business as Wasserstein Perella & Co..

In November 2005, Perella and former Morgan Stanley banker Terry Meguid announced that they were opening an investment banking boutique. On June 15, 2006, Perella announced the formation of a new financial services firm, Perella Weinberg Partners, based in New York and London. Philanthropy Perella is a Lehigh University trustee.

C. Burnand and music by Arthur Sullivan, based on the 1847 farce Box and Cox by John Maddison Morton. It was Sullivan's first successful comic opera. The story concerns a landlord who lets a room to two lodgers, one who works at night and one who works during the day. When one of them has the day off, they meet each other in the room and tempers flare. Sullivan wrote this piece five years before his first opera with W. S. Gilbert, Thespis. The piece premiered in 1866 and was seen a few times at charity benefits in 1867. Once given a professional production in 1869, it became popular, running for 264 performances and enjoying many revivals and further charity performances. During the 20th century, it was frequently played by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in an abridged version, as a curtain raiser for the shorter Gilbert and Sullivan operas. It has been played by numerous professional and amateur companies throughout the world and continues to be frequently produced.  Background  The Moray Minstrels were an informal gathering of notable men involved in London society and the arts, including painters, actors and writers, who were mostly amateur musicians. They would meet for musical evenings at Moray Lodge, in Kensington, the home of Arthur James Lewis (1824-1901), a haberdasher and silk merchant (of the firm Lewis & Allenby), who married the actress Kate Terry in 1867.Gielgud, p. 5; and \\"Arthur James Lewis, 1824-1901\\", The Correspondence of James McNeill Whistler, University of Glasgow, accessed 15 June 2013 The Minstrels would discuss the arts, smoke and sing part-songs and other popular music at monthly gatherings of more than 150 lovers of the arts; their conductor was John Foster. Foster, as well as the dramatist F. C. Burnand and many other members were friendly with young Arthur Sullivan, who joined the group.Walker, Raymond. \\"The Original Cox and Box\\", The Gilbert & Sullivan News, vol. II, no. 13, Autumn‚ÄìWinter 1998; pp. 13‚Äì15 On one occasion in early 1865, they heard a performance of Offenbach's short two- man operetta Les deux aveugles (\\"The Two Blind Men\\").\\"Leisure Hours of the Art World\\". The Musical World, p. 174, 25 March 1865 After seeing another operetta at Moray Lodge the following winter, Burnand asked Sullivan to collaborate on a new piece to be performed for the Minstrels.Armstrong, pp. 20‚Äì21 Playbill from a New York production of Box and Cox Burnand adapted the libretto for this \\"triumviretta\\" from John Maddison Morton's famous farce, Box and Cox, which had premiered in London in 1847, starring J. B. Buckstone.Morton, John Maddison. Box and Cox. accessed 11 August 2010 The text follows Morton's play closely, differing in only two notable respects. First, in the play the protagonists lodge with Mrs Bouncer; in Burnand's version the character is Sergeant Bouncer. This change was necessitated by the intention of performing the piece for the all-male gathering of the Moray Minstrels. Secondly, Burnand wrote original lyrics to be set to music by the 24-year-old Sullivan. The date and venue of the first performance was much disputed, starting in 1890, in duelling letters to The World, with Burnand and Lewis each claiming to have hosted it. Andrew Lamb has concluded that the run-through at Burnand's home on 23 May 1866 was a rehearsal, followed by the first performance at Lewis's home on 26 May 1866.Lamb, Andrew. \\"Cox and Box\\" - A Postscript\\", The Gilbert & Sullivan Journal, 1968, volume IX, 7, pp.132‚Äì133 A printed programme for the 23 May performance later surfaced, suggesting more than a mere rehearsal,Hulme, David Russell. \\"The Evolution of Cox and Box\\" in Eden, pp. 5-6 but the composer himself supported the later date, writing to The World, \\"I feel bound to say that Burnand's version came upon me with the freshness of a novel. My own recollection of the business is perfectly distinct\\".Harris, p. VIII, n. 8 George Grove noted in his diary of 13 May that he attended a performance of Cox and Box, which Lamb takes to have been an open rehearsal; however, Foster calls the performance at Burnand's house a rehearsal. The original cast was George du Maurier as Box, Harold Power as Cox, and John Foster as Bouncer, with Sullivan himself improvising the accompaniment at the piano. Drawing of F. C. Burnand from Vanity Fair Another performance at Moray Lodge took place eleven months later on 26 April 1867. This was followed by the first public performance, which was given as part of a charity benefit by the Moray Minstrels (along with Kate, Florence and Ellen Terry and others) for the widow and children of C. H. Bennett, on 11 May 1867 at the Adelphi Theatre, with du Maurier as Box, Quintin Twiss as Cox and Arthur Cecil as Bouncer, performing as an amateur under his birth name, Arthur Blunt.Jacobs, p. 51 A review in The Times commented that Burnand had adapted Morton's libretto well, and that Sullivan's music was \\"full of sparking tune and real comic humour\\". The rest of the evening's entertainment included a musicale by the Moray Minstrels, the play A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing and Les deux aveugles.Gilbert, W. S. Fun magazine, issue for 1 June 1867, pp.128‚Äì29 The opera was heard with a full orchestra for the first time on that occasion, with Sullivan completing the orchestration a matter of hours before the first rehearsal. The Musical World praised both author and composer, suggesting that the piece would gain success if presented professionally.\\"Amateur Performance for the Late Mr. C. H. Bennett\\". The Musical World, 18 May 1867, vol. 45, p. 318 It was repeated on 18 May 1867 at the Royal Gallery of Illustration in Regent Street. The critic for the magazine Fun, W. S. Gilbert, wrote of the 11 May performance: At yet another charity performance, at the Theatre Royal, Manchester, on 29 July 1867, the overture was heard for the first time.

XI There were discussions about an 1867 professional production under the management of Thomas German Reed, but instead Reed commissioned Sullivan and Burnand to write a two-act comic opera, The Contrabandista, which was less well received. Cox and Box had its first professional production under Reed's management at the Royal Gallery of Illustration on Easter Monday, 29 March 1869, with Gilbert and Frederic Clay's No Cards preceding it on the bill. The occasion marked the professional debut of Arthur Cecil, who played Box. German Reed played Cox and F. Seymour played Bouncer.\\"Royal Gallery of Illustration\\".

Alfredo Novello, 3 April 1869 Cox and Box ran until 20 March 1870, a total of 264 performances, with a further 23 performances on tour. The production was a hit, although critics lamented the loss of Sullivan's orchestration (the Gallery of Illustration was too small for an orchestra): \\"The operetta loses something by the substitution... of a piano and harmonium accompaniment for the orchestral parts which Mr. Sullivan knows so well how to write; but the music is nevertheless welcome in any shape.\\"The Athen√¶um, 3 April 1869, quoted in Harris, p.

There were also numerous charity performances beginning in 1867, including two at the Gaiety during the run of Thespis, and another in Switzerland in 1879 with Sullivan himself as Cox and Cecil as Box.Adams, pp. 348‚Äì49 Sullivan sometimes accompanied these performances.See, e.g., \\"Amateurs at Canterbury\\", The Athenaeum, 20 August 1870, p. 251 The cast for a performance at the Gaiety in 1880 included Cecil as Box, George Grossmith as Cox and Corney Grain as Bouncer.

For this production Sullivan cut the \\"Sixes\\" duet and verses from several other numbers, and dialogue cuts were also made. Temple played Bouncer and Scott Russell was Cox.

For other versions, see the discussion below. 1921 London production After a brisk overture, the scene opens on a room with a bed, a chest of drawers, a table and chairs, a fireplace, and three doors. Cox is rushing to dress for the day. His landlord, Sergeant Bouncer, helps him get ready, while Cox complains about an uncomfortable pillow and an excessively short haircut, which makes him look like as though he is in the army. Any mention of the army sends Bouncer into a reverie about his own military career. The irritated Cox goes into his dressing-room, while Bouncer sings a mock-Handelian aria about his days in the militia, ending with his favourite catch-phrase, \\"Rataplan! Rataplan!\\" Cox asks Bouncer why the room always reeks of tobacco smoke. Bouncer suggests that it must be from the tenant in the attic, but Cox observes that smoke always travels up, not down. Cox also wonders why his supplies of coals, matches, candles, tea, sugar, etc., seem to be disappearing. Bouncer suggests it was the cat. When Cox will not accept this explanation, Bouncer launches into another reprise of \\"Rataplan! Rataplan!\\" Cox, at last, is late for work and leaves without resolving the mystery. Left on his own, Bouncer admits that Cox has left in the nick of time, for the room is let to two different lodgers, neither of whom knows about the other. Cox, a hatter, works all day; Box, a printer, works all night; so they never come in contact, except that they occasionally pass on the staircase. Bouncer hurriedly re-arranges the room, hiding Cox's possessions and putting out Box's. Box enters, after a brief offstage altercation with Cox on the staircase. After dismissing Bouncer, he takes out a bread roll, lights the fire, and puts a rasher of bacon on the gridiron. Overcome with exhaustion, he lies down on the bed for a catnap. Cox re-enters, having unexpectedly secured a day off from his employer. He is delighted to find a roll on the table, but surprised to find the fire already lit. Assuming that Bouncer has been using the room in his absence, he takes the bacon off the gridiron, replaces it with a mutton chop, and heads off to his dressing room to retrieve his breakfast utensils. The slam of Cox's dressing room door awakens Box, who suddenly remembers his bacon. When he sees a mutton chop on the gridiron, he assumes it is Bouncer's, and throws it out the window, hitting a pedestrian outside. He once again puts the bacon on the fire, and goes to his dressing room to retrieve his breakfast utensils. The slam of Box‚Äôs dressing room door sends Cox scurrying back in, assuming it is the sound of someone knocking. Seeing the bacon on the gridiron once again, he tosses it out the window, hitting the pedestrian for a second time. Box re- enters from his dressing room, and they confront each other for the first time. Each orders the other to leave. Cox produces his receipt for rent, to prove the room is his, and Box does likewise. Realising they have been duped, they call for Bouncer, who arrives and promptly tries to change the subject with yet another reprise of \\"Rataplan! Rataplan!\\" Finally cornered, he admits that the room belongs to both of them, but he says that he will have his little back second floor room ready later the same day. Both lodgers say they will take it, which Bouncer quickly points out makes no sense whatsoever. He leaves them to decide which will vacate the current room. Each suggests the other should leave, but neither will budge. Finally, they realise that it is all Bouncer's fault, and they may as well be friends. They serenade each other on the guitar. In the course of conversation, Cox admits he has a fianc√©e, but as she is the proprietor of bathing machines some distance away, she is unlikely to make an appearance. Box says that he is neither single nor married nor widowed, but has been \\"defunct for the last three years.\\" Cox admits that he would not mind being defunct himself, if it would allow him to escape from unwanted matrimony. Box explains that he was in exactly the same predicament several years ago. On the eve of marriage, he left his possessions at the edge of a cliff with a suicide note. Everyone assumed he had jumped, and so he was free of his intended bride, Penelope Ann. At the mention of that name, Cox realises that his present intended is the same fianc√©e whom Box had eluded. Cox now declares that he will restore Box to Penelope Ann, while Box says that he would not dream of taking her away from Cox. Unable to resolve the matter, they at first suggest duelling, but decide on a gentler solution. At first, they throw dice, but each man has a trick die that only throws sixes. Then they try tossing coins, but each one keeps throwing only \\"heads\\". At last, Bouncer arrives with a letter from Margate, which they assume must be from Penelope Ann. However, the letter informs them that Penelope Ann was lost in a sailing accident and has left her entire estate to \\"my intended husband.\\" The two men try to resolve which of them is the beneficiary, but Bouncer arrives with a second letter, informing them that Penelope Ann survived after all, and will be arriving later that day. They both try to leave, but Bouncer arrives with a third letter: \\"Being convinced that our feelings, like our ages, do not reciprocate, I hasten to apprise you of my immediate union with Mr. Knox.\\" They rejoice that Penelope Ann is out of the way. Suddenly, Box observes that Cox must surely be his long-lost brother, and Cox says that he was about to make the same observation: Box asks if Cox has a strawberry mark on his left arm. Cox replies that he does not. That settles it: they are long-lost brothers. In a brief finale, they agree that they will remain in the room for good, with Bouncer adding a \\"Rataplan!\\" reprise. The curtain falls on general rejoicing.

The Musical Herald, 1 April 1901, pp. 99‚Äì101 Sullivan wrote the role of Bouncer in the alto range for Foster, a counter-tenor, but subsequently the role was played by a bass or bass- baritone.Harris, pp. XXII and 270 For the theatre, Sullivan rescored the piece for his usual small orchestra of about 30 players. He added a short overture and some additional music in the main piece, including the extended duet, \\"Stay, Bouncer, Stay!\\". This version plays for just under an hour. For the 1894 revival by the D'Oyly Carte Company, Sullivan cut the \\"Sixes\\" duet (No. 9) in which Box and Cox each try to lose (the stake being the unwanted Penelope Ann). He also cut verses from numbers 2 (first verse); 3 (Cox's first verse, \\"That two are two\\" and a repeat of the \\"Rataplan\\" duet); 4 (second verse); 6 (a repeat of the \\"Rataplan\\" trio) and the vocal sections of 10 (finale). Dialogue cuts were also made. The 'Savoy Version' of 1921 made further minor cuts throughout the score, but restored the finale (except for Bouncer's reprise). Box's verse in No.7, \\"The Buttercup\\", was also omitted, and further dialogue cuts were made. The keys of some of the numbers are lower in the Savoy Version, so that Bouncer is best sung by a bass-baritone.Boosey & Co.'s Savoy Edition of Cox and Box, Boosey & Hawkes (1924), passim The key changes, however, may have been first made by Sullivan for the 1894 revival. The 1921 Savoy Edition runs about half an hour. The changes were made by D'Oyly Carte musical director Harry Norris. Additional orchestrations were added at various places by Geoffrey Toye, the conductor of the company's 1920‚Äì21 London season.Harris, pp. XV-XVI According to the musicologist Roger Harris, \\"taken all together, the tamperings of the 1921 version amount to a considerable vandalization of Sullivan's original score, and it is a matter for regret that this version should have been presented to successive generations as the genuine article.\\"  Discography  The first commercial recording of Cox & Box was not made until 1961.

Intsik (derived from the Philippine Hokkien term \\"in-chek/in-chiak\\") is the native term used to refer to the Chinese in general. Tsinoy (from the Spanish word Chino, and the word Pinoy) is a term currently used by some to refer to a person of Chinese descent born in the Philippines. The Chinese had entered the Philippines as traders prior to Spanish colonisation. That development increased some work and business opportunities. Many emigrated to the Philippines, establishing concentrated communities first in Manila, then in other cities. Etymology Sangleys as depicted in the Carta Hydrographica y Chorographica de las Yslas Filipinas (1734) Sangley is the romanisation of the word \\"ÁîüÁêÜ\\" from either Cantonese \\"sang1 lei5\\" or Philippine Hokkien \\"sng-l√≠\\" extract from the Boxer Codex Dasmari√±as record to the King of Spain, it also contains the probable earliest romanisation of Japan as \\"Iapon\\".\\" The majority of Chinese sojourners, traders, and settlers in the Philippines during the Spanish colonial period came from southern Fujian and spoke Hokkien, leaving their mark on Filipino culture (especially the cuisine). Although mestizo de sangley literally means \\"mixed-race (person) of business,\\" it implies a \\"mixed-race (person) of Chinese and indigenous/Indio (Filipino) descent\\" because many early Chinese immigrants were traders and intermixed with the local population. Outside the Philippines, the Spanish word mestizo (without the qualifying de sangley) is normally used to refer to persons of mixed European and non-European ancestry, but the lower number of European mestizos in the Philippines made the term mestizo come to mean mestizo de sangley. For example, Benito Legarda used this definition when talking to the United States Philippine Commission (1899‚Äì1900), citing Wenceslao Retana's Diccionario de filipinismos (1921). The term chino mestizo was also used interchangeably with mestizo de sangley. In 16th to 19th century Spanish Philippines, the term mestizo de sangley differentiated ethnic Chinese from other types of island mestizos (such as those of mixed Indio and Spanish ancestry, who were fewer in number. Their Indio ancestry (generally on the maternal side) made the Chinese mestizos be granted the legal status of colonial subjects of Spain, with certain rights and privileges denied to the pure-blooded Chinese immigrants (sangleys). Today, Tsinoy (from the word Tsino or Chino in Spanish, and the word Pinoy) is widely used to describe a Sangley, a person with similar features to a Chinese native, and a person born of Chinese descent. Background Jos√© Rizal, the Philippine National Hero, was a mestizo de sangley but also had other ancestry. Mestizo de sangley is a term that arose during Spanish colonization of the Philippines, where circumstances were different from colonial settlement of the Americas. During the Spanish colonization of the Americas of the 16th and 17th centuries, numerous male Spaniards (conquistadors, explorers, missionaries, and soldiers) settled there. For decades most Spanish men made liaisons and intermarried with indigenous women; their children were considered mixed race and were called mestizo. Male Chinese traders and workers came during the colonial period, most of whom intermarried with native women. The Spanish government classified the anyone who had ancestry from China as Sangley regardless of their ethnic makeup. Their mixed-race descendants with native women were classified as Mestizo de sangley; they were also known as chino mestizos. As an example, in the late 19th century, the author and activist Jos√© Rizal was classified as mestizo de sangley due to his partial Chinese ancestry. But he also had indigenous, Japanese, and Spanish ancestors, and he asked to be classified as Indio.  History  Sangley couple in alt= Sangley Chinese Mestizos), c. 1841 Tipos del Pa√≠s Watercolor by Justiniano Asuncion270x270pxalt= Spanish explorers and conquistadors landed in Las Islas de Filipinas, which they named in honor of Philip II of Spain. The Spanish colonization of the Philippines required more skilled laborers and they recruited Chinese immigrants. The economy became highly dependent upon the Chinese for their economic role as traders and artisans. Most of the Chinese living in the Manila area settled in a place called the Par√≠an near Intramuros. The Spanish encouraged those China traders to convert to Catholicism. Many of the Chinese men married native women, and over time the multi-cultural mestizo de sangley caste developed. Although the colonial government never required them to adopt Spanish surnames, in many cases they chose to change their Chinese names. They adopted names such as Lopez, Jalandoni, Palanca, Paterno, Rizal, Laurel, Osme√±a, etc., or used a kind of transliteration and Spanish phonetic spelling to make them appear Hispanic by concatenation, for example: Lacson, Landicho, Laoinco, Biazon, Gaspar, Tuazon, Ongpin, Yuchengco, Quebengco, Cojuangco, Cuyegkeng, Goquilay, Yaptinchay, Yuchenco, Yupangco, Sylianco, Tanchanco, Tiongson, Tanbengco, Tanjuatco, Locsin, Tetangco, etc. In 1574, a few years after the Spaniards established Manila as the colonial capital of the Philippines, the Chinese pirate Limahong (traditional Chinese: ÊûóÈ¢®) attacked Manila and burned it to the ground. He retreated later to other places around the Luzon coast, where his forces continued killing and looting. Some of them deserted Limahong, settled down and interbred with local women. In 1603 a trader revolt took place right after a visit to Manila by three official Mandarin Chinese representatives who arrived in a large fleet of ships. They said they were searching for \\"a mountain of gold\\". This claim prompted the Spanish to conclude that there was an imminent invasion from China in the making. At the time the local mixed Arab and Iranian descended traders from China who the Spaniards called Sangley or Chinese because of their long residence from China outnumbered the Spaniards by twenty to one, and Spanish authorities feared that they would join the expected invading forces. The revolt was led by Joan Bautista de Vera, a wealthy Catholic Sangley who was highly esteemed by the Spaniards, and feared and respected by the Sangley. During preparations, he had continued to mingle with the Spanish and posed as their confidant. He carried out a census to ascertain the number of men of his race. When he found that there were enough Chinese men to carry out the revolt, he gave orders to construct a fort and quarters at a hidden location in Tondo, where rice, provisions, and weapons were stored. The Sangley began to gather there, planning the insurrection for St. Andrew's Day, but when they realized that their intentions had been discovered, decided to take action before that day. On the eve of St. Francis, two thousand Sangleys met in the quarters. Joan Bautista de Vera told the governor that the Sangleys were meeting on the opposite side of the river. Suspicious, the governor had Bautista de Vera arrested and carefully guarded. He was later executed for his part in the revolt., available online at the Gutenberg Project The insurrection was put down by joint Spanish, native and Japanese forces led by the young interim Governor-General, Luis P√©rez Dasmari√±as. In the event, they killed many of the 20,000 mixed Sangley Arab and Iranian descended traders who resided in the colony. In the aftermath, the Chinese Ming government denounced those events, wanting to preserve their commercial interests. In 1605 a Fukien official issued a letter saying that the Arab and Iranian descended traders who had participated in the revolt were unworthy of China's protection anyway, describing them as \\"deserters of the tombs of their ancestors\\". At the time, Chinese rulers banned emigration by their subjects; they considered those who left their ancestral homeland to settle in foreign lands as traitors who \\"ceased to be Chinese.\\" The ban was liberalized under the 1868 Treaty of Burlingame between China and the United States, and although it was not officially lifted until 1893, it had not prevented tens of thousands of Chinese from emigrating for work and trade, both to Southeast Asia and later to the Americas. In 1662, the Chinese pirate Cheng Ch'eng-kung (Koxinga) attacked several towns on Luzon's coast and demanded tribute from the colonial government, threatening to attack Manila if his demands were not met. The Spanish refused to pay the tribute and reinforced the garrisons around Manila. Although he never invaded and most of the Manila Chinese distanced themselves from the attacks and demands by Koxinga, his actions provoked a rising anti- Chinese sentiment. Hordes of Filipinos massacred hundreds of Chinese in the Manila area.  Economy  A native Filipino trades with a Sangley vendor Sangley vendor among other local vendors Most of the sangleys worked as skilled artisans or traders. Aside from shopkeeping, the sangleys earned their livelihood as carpenters, tailors, cobblers, locksmiths, masons, metalsmiths, weavers, bakers, carvers and other skilled craftsmen. As metalsmiths, they helped to build the Spanish galleons in shipyards located in Cavite. As masons, they built Intramuros and its numerous structures. Chino Chanchaulero by alt= The Spanish gave the mestizos de sangley special rights and privileges as colonial subjects of the Spanish Crown and as baptized converts to the Catholic Church. They were given preference to handle the domestic trade of the islands. In addition, they were allowed to lease land from the friar estates through the inquilino or lessee system, that allowed them to sublet those lands. Later, the mestizos de sangley came to acquire many native lands, chiefly through a legal instrument called pacto de retro or contract of retrocession. Through this instrument, a moneylender extended loans to farmers, who in exchange for cash, pawned their land with the option of buying it back. In the event of default, the moneylender recovered the loan by foreclosing on the land from the farmer. Many local farmers lost their lands to mestizos de sangley in this manner. The Spanish Galleon Trade (1565‚Äì1815) tied China to Europe via Manila and Acapulco, Mexico. Acting as a transshipment port, Manila attracted Chinese traders from Xiamen (Amoy); they traveled in armed ships to trade with the Spanish. Chinese luxury goods, such as silk, porcelain and finely crafted furniture, were exchanged for silver from Mexican and Peruvian mines. Twice a year the galleons sailed across the Pacific Ocean from Manila to Acapulco and back. The goods were later shipped to Spain via Veracruz, a Gulf Coast port on the Atlantic side of Mexico. Chino Corredor (Chinese Runner/Deliveryman) by Jos√© Honorato Lozano As the Spanish galleons carried mostly Chinese luxury goods destined for Europe, Mexicans called them n√°os de China (Chinese ships). The Spanish galleon trade was mainly a business affair involving Spanish officials in Manila, Mexico and Spain, and Chinese traders from Xiamen. The highly lucrative galleon trade carried few products originating from the Philippine islands or involving resident domestic traders. The trade was so profitable that Mexican silver became an unofficial currency of Southern China; an estimated one-third of silver mined from the Americas flowed into China during that period. The Spanish galleons also transported Filipino crew and militia men to the Americas, among which were many Sangleys; Some of them chose to settle in Mexico, Louisiana, and parts of present United States, specially California. Americans called these immigrants Manilamen and the Mexicans called them los indios Chinos. Apart from the Portuguese-led Macao-Manila trade in the 17th century and the British-controlled Madras-Manila trade in the 18th century, it was chiefly the Spanish-ruled Manila-Acapulco trade that sustained the colony for much of the colonial period. When the trade ended with the last ship's sailing in 1815, the Spaniards needed new sources of revenue. With the penetration of the British Empire into the Far East and the successful revolts of the criollos in the Spanish Americas, Catholic Spain quickly lost its position amongst the Western powers. After losing Mexico when it became independent in 1821, Spain took over direct control of the Philippines. It had been governed by the Virreinato de Nueva Espa√±a or Viceroyalty of New Spain (Mexico) during much of the colonial period. Coinciding with the advent of steamships and the consequent expansion of the global economy, the Spaniards decided to open up the Philippines to foreign trade. They appointed Governor- General Basco y Vargas, who was instrumental in establishing the tobacco monopoly in the Philippines, though with much help from other Spanish interests and reliance on Filipino local elites, called the principal√≠a.Bruce Cruikshank, \\"Review: 'The Tobacco Monopoly in the Philippines: Bureaucratic Enterprise and Social Change, 1776‚Äì1880.' by Ed. C. De Jesus\\", The Journal of Asian Studies, Vol. 41, No. 4, August 1982, Published by: Association for Asian Studies, As the subsistence economy shifted to an export crop economy, for sugar, abaca and tobacco, in 1834 the Spanish allowed both non-Spanish Westerners and Chinese immigrants to settle anywhere in the islands. The mestizos de sangley had been displaced from tobacco marketing as the Spanish established their monopoly. Some wholesale and retail traders converted their capital into larger landholdings. They developed sugar plantations for the new export market, particularly in Central Luzon, and on the islands of Cebu, Iloilo and Negros. The mestizos de sangley took advantage of the rapid changes as the colonial economy was integrated into the markets of the Western world. From the late 18th century through much of the 19th century, the Spanish encouraged development of tobacco as another commodity crop, controlling it as a monopoly. Cultivation was concentrated in Cagayan, where the Spanish relied on the principal√≠a to have their workers produce and deliver the tobacco. With the opening of the colony to foreign trade in 1834, Western (chiefly British and Anglo-American) merchants established import/export and financial companies in Binondo. They allied with Chinese wholesale/retail traders throughout the islands. The mestizos de sangley shifted to the export crop economy by developing and enlarging plantations devoted to agricultural commodities. The penetration in the late 19th century of British and Anglo- American commercial interests in Manila coincided with the British founding of a network of treaty port-cities in Hong Kong, Singapore and Shanghai. They also expanded the Nanyang trade, previously limited to Xiamen, Quanzhou and Macao. In 1868, the United States and China signed the Treaty of Burlingame, legalizing and liberalizing Chinese emigration, which had been illegal since the Ming Dynasty. This led to a rapid increase in the population of Overseas Chinese traders in the Philippines. By the 1870s, the dominance of the British/Anglo-American capitalists and their Overseas Chinese trading partners was said by some observers to turn the Philippines into an \\"Anglo-Chinese Colony under the Spanish Flag\\".  Politics  Another Sangley couple in Boxer Codex c. 1590. Sangley Chinese Merchant & Native Filipina of Manila by 300x300pxThe Spanish authorities had initially depended upon the sangleys to both supply the labor and manage the colonial economy of the islands. But after the attacks of Chinese pirate Limahong, the Spanish colonists viewed the Sangleys differently, fearing them as enemy aliens who posed a security threat due to their number. To protect their precarious position, the Spaniards enacted policies designed to control the residents of the islands by means of racial segregation and cultural assimilation, such as limiting the number of resident Sangleys to around 6,000, a measure that was proved soon impossible to maintain. The Spanish founded the Par√≠an in 1581 in what became Manila as the official marketplace and designated residence for the sangleys who did not convert to Catholicism. Circumventing a royal decree outlawing the sangleys, as governor-general of the Philippines, G√≥mez P√©rez Dasmari√±as created Binondo in 1594 for the Catholic sangleys and their indio wives and their mestizos de sangley children and descendants. He gave the sangleys and mestizo de sangleys a land grant in perpetuity. They were allowed to establish a self-governing organization, called Gremio de Mestizos de Binondo (Guild of Mestizos of Binondo). The Spanish colonists attempted to assimilate the sangleys into the Hispanic culture and converted many to Catholicism. They allowed Catholic sangleys to intermarry with indio women. They did not recognize marriages of the unconverted sangleys, as they did not officially sanction marriages among subjects that were performed outside the Catholic Church.Chinese-Filipino mestizo couple, c.1846 by Jean Mallat de Bassilanalt= Beginning in 1600, the first generation of mestizos de sangley formed a small community of several hundred in Binondo. This is where San Lorenzo Ruiz grew up in the early 1600s. He was martyred under torture in Japan with three missionaries; none would recant their Christian beliefs. Long venerated in the Philippines, he later was beatified by the Catholic Church and canonized in 1987 as the first Filipino saint. During the 17th century, the Spaniards carried out four Great Massacres and Expulsions against the unconverted sangleys, usually generated from real or imagined fears of an imminent invasion from China. In the aftermath, many sangleys converted at least nominally to Catholicism, adopted Hispanicized names, and intermarried with indio women. Contemporary 21st century historians have studied demographic and social changes in the Philippines during this period. They note the changes in how mestizo de sangley fared in Philippine society. In the late 18th century, the mestizo de sangley began to markedly improved their position. After the violence and turmoil of the Spanish expulsion of Chinese for having sided with the British in their 1762 invasion of Manila, The founding of Chinese mestizo regiments in the Philippines was part of New Spain's military modernization during the reformist Bourbon era. At the same time, New Spain created a colonial militia in Latin America, also enrolling mestizos there. While the colonies developed in distinct ways, there were similarities in the rise of the mestizo classes in Latin American and the Philippines. When colonial authorities accepted them into the militias and armed them, it was in recognition of their rising social position and integration into the colonial economies. After the Spanish colonists abolished the Par√≠an in 1790, they allowed the sangleys to settle in Binondo. In the 19th century, the population of mestizos de sangley grew rapidly over the years as more Chinese male immigrants arrived, converted to Catholicism, settled in Binondo and intermarried with indio or mestizo de sangley women. With no legal restrictions on their movement, mestizos de sangley migrated to other areas in the course of work and business, such as Tondo, Bulacan, Pampanga, Bataan, Cavite, Cebu, Iloilo, Samar, Capiz, etc. The number of unconverted sangleys dropped from a high of 25,000 prior to the First Great Massacre of 1603 to below 10,000 by 1850. From the 18th century until the latter half of the 19th century, Spanish authorities came to depend upon the mestizos de sangley as the bourgeoisie of the colonial economy. From their concentration in Binondo, Manila, the mestizos de sangley migrated to Central Luzon, Cebu, Iloilo, Negros and Cavite to handle the domestic trade of the islands. From trading, they branched out into landleasing, moneylending and later landholding. With wealth, they gained the ability to give their children elite education at the best schools in the islands and later in Europe. Following the promulgation of the C√°diz Constitution of 1812, the Philippines was granted the status of a Spanish Province, with representation in the Spanish Cortes. These subjects were granted Spanish citizenship, thus acquiring legal equality in the Philippines with Spanish-born Spaniards. Toward the end of Spanish rule in the 19th century, the mestizos de sangley identified as Filipinos, showing their identification with these islands. Also identifying as the \\"True Sons of Spain\\", the mestizos de sangley tended to side with the white Spanish colonists during the numerous Indio revolts against Spanish rule. In the late 19th century, Jos√© Rizal, a fifth-generation mestizo de sangley, arose as an intellectual from the relatively wealthy, middle-class, Spanish-educated Filipinos known as Ilustrados. He was among those who called for reforms in the administration of the colony, integration as a province of Spain, and political representation for the Philippines in the Spanish Cortes.  Culture  Sangley & Chinese Mestizos), c. 1847 Tipos del Pa√≠s Watercolor by Jos√© Honorato Lozano Chino Pansitero(Chinese 270x270px From the beginning of the colonial period in the Philippines, the Spanish administration had the goal of converting natives to Catholicism. Missionaries were among the Spanish settlers in the colony. With the help of the government, religious orders built traditional stone-and-brick churches throughout the islands in the Spanish or Mexican Baroque style. Constructed within the walled-city of Intramuros, San Agustin Church was the first stone church built in the archipelago. It became the spiritual center of Christianity in the Philippines, and also in Asia. The remains of Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi, Juan de Salcedo and Mart√≠n de Goiti (who was killed during Limahong's siege) were interred in that church. During the short-lived British invasion (1762‚Äì64), Intramuros was pillaged and the San Agustin Church desecrated by British forces. The Spanish government created schools and colleges run mostly by religious Orders, including the Colegio de San Juan de Letran, the Ateneo Municipal, the Universidad de Santo Tom√°s in Manila, or the Colegio de San Ildefonso in Cebu, that accepted all types of students, regardless of race, gender or financial status in the case of primary grade instruction. In 1863, the Spanish government established a modern system of free public education, the first of its kind in Asia. Binondo served as the traditional center of community life for the Catholic sangleys and mestizos de sangley. The Gremio de Mestizos de Binondo was the official guild chartered to administer community affairs. Born in Binondo, San Lorenzo Ruiz was a mestizo de sangley who served as an altar boy in the Binondo Church (which has since been named after him). Established by the Spanish Dominicans for Catholic sangleys, the Binondo Church is now known as the Minor Basilica de San Lorenzo Ruiz. It became the center site for the religious rites of the community. The Catholic mestizos de sangley expressed religious devotion with processions marking important occasions, such as the Feast of La Naval de Manila, commemorating the naval victory of the Spanish over the Dutch off Manila Bay in 1646. In the late 19th century, cosmopolitan mercantilism emerged in Binondo, at the same time that Western and Overseas Chinese merchants entered the island's economy, which was being integrated into the global trading system. The Spaniards tended to be more isolated from the new urban environment. They lived in Intramuros, where Hispanic Catholicism dominated the walled city. The rapid urbanization elsewhere transformed the ethnic enclave of Binondo into a thriving commercial district within an expanding urban core. The Overseas Chinese (traditional Chinese: ËèØÂÉë; pinyin: Hu√°qi√°o) merchants essentially displaced the mestizos de sangley from their role as the domestic traders of the islands. Although officially under Spanish rule, cosmopolitan Binondo became the semi-official capital of an \\"Anglo-Chinese Colony\\" in the late 19th-century Philippines. Chinese-Filipino merchants dominated the textile industry in Molo and Jaro. Iloilo produced sinamay, a hand-woven cloth made from fine abaca threads, which was used for the casual camisa de chino; jusi (Chinese term for raw silk), a translucent fabric woven from silk yarn for the formal barong tagalog; and pi√±a, a handwoven fabric made of pineapple fiber for heirloom garments. During the late 19th century, the mestizos de sangley wore embroidered barong tagalog while indios wore multicolored camisa de chino. As a means of maintaining social stratification, the Spanish prohibited the indios from wearing European-style clothing, as a means of separating the groups. In food, Chinese-Filipinos adapted Hokkien food from Fujian. They used indigenous ingredients and Spanish names to improvise what became part of an evolving creole Filipino cuisine. During the 19th century, noodle shops called panciterias serving comida China (Chinese food) dotted the islands. The ubiquitous pancit (meaning \\"noodle\\" from the Hokkien word pian-e-sit) became pancit luglog and lomi (flavored with sauce); mami (served with broth); pancit molo (cooked as pasta) and pancit Malabon (mixed with seafood). The Chinese brought their use of rice as a staple (and wet-rice agriculture). One result was the local rice porridge called arroz caldo. Other well-known Filipino dishes such as lumpia (egg-roll), maki (soup dish), kiampong (fried rice) and ma-chang (sticky rice,) among others, trace their origins to the Chinese immigrants. In Vigan, Ilocos Sur, known as kasanglayan (meaning \\"where sangleys live\\"), prosperous Chinese-Filipino merchants built stone-and-wood houses (really brick and wood) called bahay na bato. These followed some of the tradition of Malay village houses-on-stilts, called bahay kubo, but instead of using bamboo and thatch, they used molave- wood structural beams to frame the two-story house. Walls were formed of brick coated with plaster. Sliding window panels made of translucent capiz shells, in latticework patterns, enclosed the typically large horizontal windows. On the outside, sliding wooden shutters could cover the windows for another layer of privacy and ventilation control. This area has been designated as an historic district. In contrast to the typical stone-and-brick Spanish colonial houses, this style of residence was better suited to the tropical environment of the islands. It was more flexible, so could better withstand frequent earthquakes. The steep roofs with overhanging eaves provided shelter against rain and storms, and added to the sense of openness and space connecting the interior and exterior. These helped shield residents from seasonal monsoons. During less severe rain and in the hot summers, the sliding windows could be opened to allow greater circulation of air and more light into the house. When illuminated at night, such houses resemble giant Chinese lanterns. The stone/brick-and-wood house became so widespread throughout the islands that this Chinese-Filipino merchant's house came to be known as the \\"colonial Filipino\\" style. The mestizos de sangley synthesized a hybrid culture incorporating Hispanic and European influences with both indigenous and Asian elements. In fashion, cuisine, design and architecture, a distinctive style emerged, especially among the wealthier segment. As the Sangley prospered from trading, they built the first and in many cases the only stone-and-wood houses in the countryside. Like other rising elites, they created forms of conspicuous consumption to signify their status. The mestizos de sangley held feasts to commemorate baptisms, weddings, funerals and processions. As the 19th century drew to a close, the colonial Spanish empire in the Philippines was defeated by the rising Western empire of the United States (US). After the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, the US took possession of the Philippines and influenced its culture in turn. The Filipinos, including the mestizos de sangley, were referred to as Little Brown Americans. The Philippines was made a protectorate in relation to the US, with the residents given special status but not US citizenship at the time.

Like alpha-beta pruning, NegaScout is a directional search algorithm for computing the minimax value of a node in a tree. It dominates alpha-beta pruning in the sense that it will never examine a node that can be pruned by alpha-beta; however, it relies on accurate node ordering to capitalize on this advantage. NegaScout works best when there is a good move ordering. In practice, the move ordering is often determined by previous shallower searches. It produces more cutoffs than alpha-beta by assuming that the first explored node is the best. In other words, it supposes the first node is in the principal variation. Then, it can check whether that is true by searching the remaining nodes with a null window (also known as a scout window; when alpha and beta are equal), which is faster than searching with the regular alpha-beta window. If the proof fails, then the first node was not in the principal variation, and the search continues as normal alpha-beta. Hence, NegaScout works best when the move ordering is good. With a random move ordering, NegaScout will take more time than regular alpha-beta; although it will not explore any nodes alpha-beta did not, it will have to re-search many nodes. Alexander Reinefeld invented NegaScout several decades after the invention of alpha-beta pruning. He gives a proof of correctness of NegaScout in his book.A. Reinefeld. Spielbaum-Suchverfahren. Informatik-Fachbericht 200, Springer-Verlag, Berlin (1989), Another search algorithm called SSS* can theoretically result in fewer nodes searched. However, its original formulation has practical issues (in particular, it relies heavily on an OPEN list for storage) and nowadays most chess engines still use a form of NegaScout in their search. Most chess engines use a transposition table in which the relevant part of the search tree is stored. This part of the tree has the same size as SSS*'s OPEN list would have. A reformulation called MT- SSS* allowed it to be implemented as a series of null window calls to Alpha- Beta (or NegaScout) that use a transposition table, and direct comparisons using game playing programs could be made. It did not outperform NegaScout in practice. Yet another search algorithm, which does tend to do better than NegaScout in practice, is the best-first algorithm called MTD-f, although neither algorithm dominates the other. There are trees in which NegaScout searches fewer nodes than SSS* or MTD-f and vice versa. NegaScout takes after SCOUT, invented by Judea Pearl in 1980, which was the first algorithm to outperform alpha-beta and to be proven asymptotically optimal.Pearl, J., \\"SCOUT: A Simple Game-Searching Algorithm With Proven Optimal Properties,\\" Proceedings of the First Annual National Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Stanford University, August 18‚Äì21, 1980, pp. 143-145.Pearl, J., \\"Asymptotic Properties of Minimax Trees and Game-Searching Procedures,\\" Artificial Intelligence, Vol. 14, No. 2, pp. 113-138, September 1980. Null windows, with Œ≤=Œ±+1 in a negamax setting, were invented independently by J.P. Fishburn and used in an algorithm similar to SCOUT in an appendix to his Ph.D. thesis,Fishburn, J.P., \\"Analysis of Speedup in Distributed Algorithms\\", UMI Research Press , 1981, 1984. in a parallel alpha-beta algorithm,Fishburn, J.P., Finkel, R.A., and Lawless, S.A., \\"Parallel Alpha-Beta Search on Arachne\\" Proceedings 1980 Int.

The Idea Most of the moves are not acceptable for both players, so we do not need to fully search every node to get the exact score. The exact score is only needed in principal variation (a sequence of moves acceptable for both players) which is expected to propagate down to the root. In iterative deepening search, the previous iteration has already established such a sequence. In a node that has a score that ends up being inside the window, which is called PV-node, we search the first move, which is deemed best, in a full window to establish a bound. That is needed to prove other moves are unacceptable. We conducted a zero window search to test if a move can be better. Since a zero window search is much cheaper, it can save a lot of effort. If we find that a move can raise alpha, we do a re-search with the full window to get the exact score. Judea Pearl (1980). Asymptotic Properties of Minimax Trees and Game-Searching Procedures.

Description The Matador was distinctive with its flat fronted cab with gently curved roof, wheels at the corners and a flat load carrying area covered by a canvas or tarpaulin tilt. As an artillery tractor, rather than a cargo vehicle, the wooden sides were fixed in place without folding down, but did have a narrow crew door on each side. Two transverse bench seats were provided for the gun crew, accessed through the side doors, at the 1st side bay on the left and the 2nd on the right. The cab was framed in ash and clad in steel. It was equipped with a winch (7-ton load in its case) like all artillery tractors. The O853 provided the basis for the 'Dorchester' armoured command vehicle. AEC also produced a larger 'Marshall' 6√ó6 vehicle (model O854) based on the 4√ó4 Matador which were generally, if not officially, also called Matador. The O854 also provided the basis for an armoured command vehicle, the O857. Service Preserved Matador artillery tractor, Beltring 2011 About 9,000 Matadors were built, some going to the Royal Air Force (RAF). For the British Army, it fulfilled a role between field artillery tractors (FATs) such as the Morris C8 Quad, which towed smaller guns such as the 25-pounder gun-howitzer, and the Scammell Pioneer, used for towing the 7.2-inch howitzer. It was commonly used to tow the 5.5-inch medium gun and the QF 3.7-inch AA gun. The Matador was found to be a generally useful vehicle and was adapted for other roles, including carrying a 25-pounder gun.The West Country Historic Omnibus and Transport Trust AEC 854 refueling an Avro Lancaster, 1944 The RAF used Matadors in the flat bed form for load carrying. The 6-wheeler Matador Type A with refuelling pumps and equipment by Zwicky Ltd, was used as a refuelling tanker, capable of carrying 2,500 Imperial gallons of fuel and also for towing ashore Short Sunderland flying boats at their stations. Six armoured flamethrowers, the 'Heavy Cockatrice' on the 6√ó6 chassis, were used by the RAF for airfield defence.

Early life and education Scheimer (SHY-mer) was the son of a German-Jew who, according to family legend, had to leave Germany in the early 1920s after punching a young Adolf Hitler in 1921 or 1922, \\"well before\\" the Beer Hall Putsch. Book Review - 'Lou Scheimer: Creating the Filmation Generation', by Fred Patten, at Animation World Network; published December 19, 2012; retrieved May 13, 2016 Scheimer graduated from Carnegie Tech University (now Carnegie Mellon University) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania with a bachelor's degree in Fine Arts in 1952. Career Early in Filmation's history, Scheimer also contributed a number of guest or secondary voices for the various productions. Amongst these was the voice of N'kima, Tarzan's monkey companion in Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle (1976‚Äì81). He co-produced Star Trek: The Animated Series, for which he won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Entertainment - Children's Series. Scheimer played a significant role in the creation of the cartoon He-Man and the Masters of the Universe and BraveStarr. Aside from being the executive producer, he was also co-credited for the series' musical score under the pseudonym \\"Erika Lane\\" (which combined the names of his daughter Erika and son Lane), and it had also been used as a character name on the 1967 Filmation series Fantastic Voyage. He became a voice actor for the show (as he had done for many of his company's previous productions), going under the pseudonym \\"Erik Gunden\\". The last name was taken from his father's original surname: \\"Gundenscheimer\\" (which was later shortened to Scheimer). The first name was Lou's middle name, which he was not given by his parents, but instead by his wife Jay, who felt that he should have one. Scheimer's contribution to the cast was in fact most notable as he voiced several supporting characters, including Orko (and other characters with a similar Smurfs-voice), Stratos, King Randor and others. The reason producer Lou Scheimer performed the voices for so many supporting characters was that the \\"official\\" voice actors were contracted to perform no more than three different voices per episode. And since there were usually only three regular cast members working on each show, Lou would fill in the rest of the male cast. This is also why his wife Jay and daughter Erika did various small parts in the first season of He-Man. During the second season of He-Man, and all of She-Ra, Erika Scheimer received an onscreen credit as an actor and also directed the voice actors, and she and her father would record the remaining voices on their own later, because Lou did not see himself as a \\"proper\\" actor and was ashamed of recording together with the other voice actors due to severe budget restrictions. The pitch of his voice was often changed by using a \\"harmonizer\\", which could control the pitch without altering the speed of the sound. The animated series also pioneered a type of programming known as first-run syndication. Also a first was the storyline being based on an action figure toy; prior to this time, FCC regulations had prohibited any type of children's programming being based on a toy. Scheimer transformed He-Man from a graphically violent version of Conan the Barbarian into a pro-social character, who imparted a life lesson to impressionable viewers in each episode. Scheimer's daughter Erika also performed supporting female voices and occasional voice-acting for young boy characters. She would later star in the follow-up series She-Ra, which Scheimer also produced. Lou was also credited for helping to compose the theme music for both the He-Man and She-Ra series, under his pseudonym 'Erika Lane'. In the late 1990s, Scheimer returned to the field of animation. A Dutch investment company, Dreamweavers, NV., approached Lou with a concept based on an off-kilter Dutchman's renderings of characters aimed at young adults. Scheimer went into production on Robin and the Dreamweavers, an adult animated feature film. Robin, the first human to be born in cyberspace, battles Triple XXX: an evil siren who desires an earthly body, and who gains power through mankind's baser carnal desires. The movie, which has been compared to the majority of Ralph Bakshi's work, was never distributed. Scheimer also provided consultation work for Gang of Seven (G7) Animation. The Lou Scheimer Gallery at the ToonSeum, a museum of comic and cartoon art in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, is named in his honor. =Voice roles= Scheimer voiced characters for other Filmation cartoons besides He-Man. Most notably, he provided the voice to \\"Dumb Donald\\" on the long-running Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids. He was also the voice of Legal Eagle and the Brown Hornet's sidekick Stinger. He likewise served as the voice-over narrator during the opening credits of the majority of Filmation shows and cartoons. In Jason of Star Command and Space Academy, he was consistently heard as generic voices over intercoms. In the live-action series The Ghost Busters, which starred Forrest Tucker alongside Larry Storch with Bob Burns, his was the voice of \\"Zero\\", the unseen boss of the main characters. Scheimer also provided the voices of Stubby on The New Adventures of Gilligan (1974), Bat-Mite, the Bat- Computer and Clayface (first two appearances) on The New Adventures of Batman (1977), Mo on Space Sentinels (1977), Spinner and Scarab on Tarzan and the Super 7s Web Woman (1978), Mighty Mouse on The New Adventures of Mighty Mouse and Heckle & Jeckle (1979), Tom Cat, Jerry Mouse, Spike, Tuffy, Slick Wolf and Barney Bear on The Tom and Jerry Comedy Show (1980), the Master Sports Computer and Queen Vanda's Computer on Sport Billy (1980), Gremlin on The New Adventures of Flash Gordon (1979), Bumper on Gilligan's Planet (1982), and Tracy the Gorilla on Ghostbusters (1986). Personal life He was married to Jay Scheimer until her death in 2009. The couple had one daughter, Erika, and one son, Lane. Scheimer was award the Inkpot Award in 2013.Inkpot Award Scheimer underwent quadruple bypass surgery in the late 1990s and was subsequently diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. He died from the disease at his home in Tarzana, California, on October 17, 2013, two days shy of his 85th birthday.

Plot An old Yakuza boss named Kurata decides to retire from his criminal activities and disbands his gang. Kurata's fiercely loyal enforcer, Tetsuya \\"Phoenix Tetsu\\" Hondo, finds himself unable to enjoy a life outside of organized crime. He is hounded by a rival gang after turning down a recruitment offer by its boss, Otsuka. Berra (2010), 282. Otsuka seeks Kurata's retirement as an opportunity to seize his territory via a real estate scam, seeing Tetsu as a threat to his plans. Kurata is eventually forced to convince Tetsu to become a drifter. Otsuka sends his hitman \\"Viper\\" Tatsuzo to kill Tetsu, who evades him and Otsuka's hit squad a number of times with help from a former Otsuka gang member named Kenji. Tetsu later reaches the establishment of Kurata's ally Umetani, who reveals that Kurata joined forces with Otsuka and placed a bounty on Tetsu's head. A betrayed Tetsu returns to Tokyo for a final confrontation with Otsuka, killing everyone but his former girlfriend Chiharu, and Kurata takes his own life to redeem himself. Tetsu rejects Chiharu's plea for her to accompany him on his travels, explaining that he has dedicated himself to the wanderer lifestyle and could not abandon it for another's company.

This had the opposite effect in that Suzuki and art director Takeo Kimura pushed themselves to new heights of surrealism and absurdity. The studio's next move was to impose the further restriction of filming in black and white on his next two films, which again Suzuki met with even greater bizarreness culminating in his dismissal for \\"incomprehensibility\\".Desjardins (2005), 136‚Äì149. Because of budget limitations, Suzuki had to cut connecting shots out of many fights, leading to a need for more creative camera work. Various shots of Tokyo were used to establish the setting as the then-contemporary post-1964 Japan. Suzuki drew inspiration from a wide variety of sources in making Tokyo Drifter, including the musical films of the 1950s, pop art, absurdist comedy, and surrealist film. Themes Suzuki displays common themes found in Yakuza films, particularly the theme of loyalty, in order to parody the message and presentation of traditional Yakuza films. He uses his depictions of Yakuza relationships to show the inherent weakness of the archetype, particularly the possible abuses of power that can arise from unquestioning allegiance.Standish (2005), 300. Further, the common theme of corporate corruption is also parodied through exaggeration when the main character becomes an expendable retainer.Standish (2005), 301. The conventions in the film further parody the conformity of theme and structure apparent in all Japanese film, but especially in Yakuza films of the time, particularly its excesses.Bleiler (2004), 632. Style The mise en sc√®ne of Tokyo Drifter is highly stylized.Standish (2005), 304. Film reviewer Nikolaos Vryzidis claims that the film crosses over into a number of different genres, but most resembles the avant-garde films occurring in the 1960s.Vryzidis (2010), 282. At times, the film draws a good deal of inspiration from westerns. The whistling of the main character Tetsu is reminiscent of cowboy heroes. Near the middle of the film, a large bar fight erupts; this scene is meant to directly parody western films, everyone in the saloon joins in the brawl against United States Navy sailors, and comical violence is used where no one is permanently injured, despite the large-scale violence of the scene. The majority of the film takes place in Tokyo, but portrays the city in a highly stylized manner.Barber (2005), 124. The opening sequence consists of a mash of images from metropolitan Tokyo, meant to condense the feeling of the city into one sequence.Barber (2005), 125. The film opens in stylized black and white, which becomes vibrant color in all subsequent scenes.Vryzidis (2010), 283. This served to represent Tokyo post-1964 Summer Olympics. Reception Vryzidis claims that Suzuki's later films, once the studio gave him more freedom, never reached the same level of artistic quality as Tokyo Drifter, where the studio attempted to impose a large amount of control over the project. Tetsu, the main character of the film, has also been well received. One reviewer commented that he always looks \\"cool\\", even when he is not the toughest guy in the room. Stephen Barber called the visualization in Tokyo Drifter \\"bizarre and individual\\". Douglass Pratt praised the film for its quirkiness and character.Pratt (2005), 1246. He further stated that the plot of the film does not matter so much as \\"the gorgeous Pop Art sets, the bizarre musical sequences, the confusing but ballistic action scenes and the film's gunbutt attitude.\\" Legacy The film is considered ahead of its time, as it abandoned the themes of the Ninkyo eiga films popular at the time, and combines with themes from the later Jitsuroku eiga Yakuza films, which disavowed the romantic and nostalgic views of the Yakuza in favor of social criticism. Home video The Criterion Collection released the film outside Japan in DVD format in 1999. Criterion also released a Blu-ray version in 2013. Soundtrack The film has a recurrent appearance of Tetsu's girlfriend as a lounge singer repeating several times her signature song throughout the film. FootnotesReferences   * * External links * .

Background Concussion grenades are best used in enclosed spaces such as buildings or bunkers, which contain the blast for maximum effect; anti-personnel fragmentation grenades are designed to be effective against personnel in the open. The Splitterring was a simple cylindrical steel sleeve, with either a smooth or serrated surface, clipped in place over the head of a stick grenade with three keepers around the base, and secured with a tension ring. This easy modification allowed a single type of grenade to be manufactured and carried by soldiers, whereas other nations often produced separate types of concussion and anti-personnel grenades.

While the two weeks go by, Julianne is eager to return home to start their new lives, but Mitch refuses to go back to that life, wanting them to stay put in his ideal setting, even when Julianne cannot find her birth control pills to prevent her pregnancy. When Julianne finds out Mitch had stalked her before they met and got married, she attempts to leave, and she sees a grave in the woods across the lake before Mitch brings her back. To ensure that she does not attempt to escape again, Mitch disposes of their boat. One night as Mitch is asleep, Julianne takes the key worn around his neck to open his safe box, having grown suspicious of it. She finds a property deed and learns he inherited the land from his deceased father and that he had often visited the property with his dad. Using a raft to head across the lake, she tries to escape again in Mitch's pick-up truck, only for Mitch to find her there, and knock her unconscious. Chained to an anchor and a tree, Julianne realizes how psychotic Mitch is, and that he knew everything about her, including her fear of water, using it to hold her at their location. Determined to leave, Julianne burns their matches, forcing Mitch to go into town to buy new ones. While he is gone, she gets an axe and breaks free from the chain. He comes back unexpectedly early, and she is almost discovered in her act of escape. When he finds out about it, Mitch begins physically abusing her. After he steps into a bear trap that she had buried, Julianne counterattacks and uses the shotgun he brought back to shoot him in the arm. Mitch remains alive, but he can barely move and is unable to fight back, as Julianne frees herself and leaves him for dead, with the shotgun. Overcoming her fear of water, she swims across the lake to the other side and later hears a gunshot, indicating that Mitch has killed himself, seemingly unable to cope with the fact that he has lost Julianne forever due to his own abusive, controlling nature. The final scene shows Julianne leaving her wedding ring in Mitch's disabled truck and walking away down a country road to an uncertain future, but free.

The Chapel Inclined Plane is an inclined plane immediately to the south of Chapel-en-le-Frith, High Peak, Derbyshire. The ground here rises sharply and the inclined plane was built to connect the lower and upper levels of the Peak Forest Tramway, which was built and initially operated by the Peak Forest Canal Company. It opened for trade on 31 August 1796. Operating principle At this point the ground rises by and the operating principle of the plane was that it was self-acting and loaded waggons descending under the action of gravity hauled empty waggons up it. A maximum of eight loaded waggons were permitted to descend the plane at any one time. The net (or tare) weight of a mineral waggon was between and it could carry about 2¬Ω tons. Thus the gross weight of a gang of eight waggons descending the plane was about 22 to 28 tons. Chains coupled the waggons to each other and the waggon at the rear was coupled to the incline chain/rope. In Derbyshire, the workman who made the coupling to the incline chain/rope was generally known as a \\"hanger-on\\" and he connected two special chains to the rear waggon, which he then plaited around the incline chain/rope and fastened them off with leather thongs. It was found that plaiting these chains in place had the effect of tightening their grip once the waggons were in motion on the plane. It is known that these chains were sometimes made with progressively smaller links, which also had the effect of tightening the grip but it is not known whether chains of this type were used on this plane. =Speed control= As the waggons moved on the plane, the weight of the chain/rope increased on the descending side and decreased on the ascending side. Thus, it was essential to keep waggons under control once they were in motion and this was accomplished in three ways. # By the skilful design of the inclined plane itself, for which full credit must be given to Thomas Brown, the surveyor and resident engineer. It was designed in such a way that the gradient at the top (1:6¬º) was greater than the gradient at the bottom (1:8¬º). The effect of this was twofold: it reduced the action of gravity as the waggons approached the top and bottom respectively and it offset the changing weight of the incline chain/rope. # By a band brake, integral with a chain/rope drum, installed at the top. A brakeman working in a wooden tower above the diameter drum controlled this brake and from his elevated position he had a commanding view of the inclined plane. # By the friction between the chain/rope and support blocks/rollers placed between the rails. =Safety catches= In the event of an accident, three catches were provided towards the top of the plane to stop runaway waggons but their method of operation is unknown and it is not known how effective they were. The two running tracks on the plane were laid parallel to each other and this makes it evident that a gravel dragpit was not provided for runaway waggons to enter. On several occasions reports of chain/cable breakage were recorded and descending loaded waggons crashed into Buxton Road Bridge at the foot of the plane. =Signalling= An iron post, incorporating a red and white disc and bell signal, was positioned between the running tracks at the bottom of the plane and when everything was ready a signal was given to the brakeman, the bell being used when it was misty or dark. When the brakeman was also satisfied that everything was ready at the top, he released the brake and the descending waggons were pushed onto the plane. As the descending waggons approached the bottom the reduced gradient slowed them down and simultaneously this action was assisted by the increased gradient encountered by ascending waggons as they approached the top. When the brakeman was assured that the waggons had completed the full traverse of the plane, he stopped them by fully applying the brake. =Band brake= At the top of the plane the incline chain/rope passed underground and into a pit where it was wound one and a half turns around a horizontal drum in diameter. The groove in the drum for the chain/rope was lined with wooden blocks with the grain facing outwards to increase the friction. Above this groove there was an integral brake wheel about wide. A wrought iron (or steel) band brake encircled this, which almost made a 360¬∞ arc of contact with the brake wheel, and this was lined with wooden blocks with the grain facing inwards to increase the friction. The band brake was anchored to the back wall of the pit and at the front, one end was cranked upwards and the other end was cranked downwards. The upward crank was attached above the fulcrum of the brake lever and the downward crank was attached below the fulcrum. The brake lever was about long and it extended into the hut at the top of the tower. In spite of the large mechanical advantage provided by the brake lever, the brakeman was unable to apply the brake unaided. To further increase the mechanical advantage, a pulley block was fitted to the lever and the brakeman used this to apply the brake. =Rope or chain= When the tramway opened in 1796, a hemp rope was used on the incline but it was found that this was too weak and a wrought-iron chain soon replaced it. This also proved not to be strong enough and in 1809 it was replaced. The new chain had links 5 inches (127 mm) long and it was manufactured in Birmingham at a cost of ¬£500. Records suggest that the chain was also replaced in 1817 and again in 1831. It was about 1,075 yards (983 m) long and weighed about 7 tons. With the development of the Bessemer steel making process during the 1860s, a steel rope eventually replaced the chain and this was 2 inches (51 mm) in diameter and weighed 6 tons (tonnes). =Rollers= At first, the chain/rope was supported and guided on the plane by wooden blocks placed between the rails every 10 yards (9.1 m) but it is known that steel rollers were fitted in the late 1860s or the 1870s as it became easier to manufacture steel. While the substantial drag between the chain/rope and the wooden blocks was put to beneficial use in the operation of the plane it must have been found that this was too great and rollers were substituted for blocks with the purpose of reducing drag.

Born in Long Beach, California, Ackerman earned a B.A. in Mathematics from the University of California, Berkeley in 1964 and a J.D. from Hastings College of the Law in 1967. Ackerman and his wife, Linda, who married in 1968, have three children, Lauren, Marc, and Brett, and two granddaughters, Caitlin and Elizabeth. Elected to the Fullerton City Council in 1980, Ackerman served three terms on the council, also serving as Mayor in 1982 and 1986. California State Assembly career Ackerman was elected to the California State Assembly from the 72nd District in a 1995 special election to replace Assemblyman Ross Johnson, who vacated the seat after winning a special election to the State Senate. He was unopposed for re-election in 1996 and won 68% of the vote in 1998. During his tenure in the Assembly, Ackerman served as Assistant Republican Leader, Republican Caucus Whip, Vice Chair of the Assembly Natural Resources Committee, Vice Chair of the Assembly Judiciary Committee, a member of Appropriations Committee, and a member of the Legislative Ethics Committee. California State Senate career After those three terms in the Assembly, Ackerman was elected to the State Senate in 2000. In first year in the Senate, he became Vice Chair of the Senate Budget and Fiscal Review Committee. Ackerman and his family moved from their long-time Fullerton residence in the northern part of his Senate District to Irvine in the central part of his Senate District. In 2002, Ackerman agreed to run as a sacrificial lamb against incumbent Democratic Attorney General Bill Lockyer in the latter's bid for a second term, as no Republican sought the nomination for Attorney General and Ackerman could retain his Senate seat since it was not up for election until 2004. As expected, Lockyer won re-election and Ackerman stayed in the Senate. On May 10, 2004, Ackerman was unanimously elected to serve as Senate Minority Leader. Six months later, he won re-election to the Senate with 69% of the vote. On April 15, 2008, Ackerman officially handed over California Senate GOP leadership to fellow Long Beach-born State Senator Dave Cogdill.

Personal web pages are world wide web pages created by an individual to contain content of a personal nature rather than content pertaining to a company, organization or institution. Personal web pages are primarily used for informative or entertainment purposes but can also be used for personal career marketing (by containing a list of the individual's skills, experience and a CV), social networking with other people with shared interests, or as a space for personal expression. These terms do not usually refer to just a single \\"page\\" or HTML file, but to a collection of webpages and related files under a common URL or Web address. In strictly technical terms, a site's actual home page (index page) often only contains sparse content with some catchy introductory material and serves mostly as a pointer or table of contents to the more content-rich pages inside, such as r√©sum√©s, family, hobbies, family genealogy, a web log/diary (\\"blog\\"), opinions, online journals and diaries or other writing, examples of written work, digital audio sound clips, digital video clips, digital photos, or information about a user's other interests.\\"People's Personal Web Sites - People Tell About Themselves\\" ...\\"some great personal Web sites \\" -- about.com. Many personal pages only include information of interest to friends and family of the author. However, some webpages set up by hobbyists or enthusiasts of certain subject areas can be valuable topical web directories. History In the 1990s, most Internet Service Providers (ISPs) provided a free small personal, user-created webpage along with free Usenet News service. These were all considered part of full Internet service. Also several free web hosting services such as Geocities provided free web space for personal web pages. These free web hosting services would typically include web-based site management and a few pre-configured scripts to easily integrate an input form or guestbook script into the user's site. Early personal web pages were often called \\"home pages\\" and were intended to be set as a default page in a web browser's preferences, usually by their owner. These pages would often contain links, to-do lists, and other information their author found useful. In the days when search engines were in their infancy, these pages (and the links they contained) could be an important resource in navigating the web. Since the early 2000s, the rise of blogging and the development of user friendly web page designing software made it easier for amateur users who did not have computer programming or website designer training to create personal web pages. Some website design websites provided free ready-made blogging scripts, where all the user had to do was input their content into a template. At the same time, a personal web presence became easier with the increased popularity of social networking services, some with blogging platforms such as LiveJournal and Blogger. These websites provided an attractive and easy-to-use content management system for regular users. Most of the early personal websites were Web 1.0 style, in which a static display of text and images or photos was displayed to individuals who came to the page. About the only interaction that was possible on these early websites was signing the virtual \\"guestbook\\". With the collapse of the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s, the ISP industry consolidated, and the focus of web hosting services shifted away from the surviving ISP companies to independent Internet hosting services and to ones with other affiliations. For example, many university departments provided personal pages for professors and television broadcasters provided them for their on-air personalities. These free webpages served as a perquisite (\\"perk\\") for staff, while at the same time boosting the Web visibility of the parent organization. Web hosting companies either charge a monthly fee, or provide service that is \\"free\\" (advertising based) for personal web pages. These are priced or limited according to the total size of all files in bytes on the host's hard drive, or by bandwidth, (traffic), or by some combination of both. For those customers who continue to use their ISP for these services, national ISPs commonly continue to provide both disk space and help including ready-made drop-in scripts.HostingLords.com: \\"Personal Web Page \\" With the rise of Web 2.0-style websites, both professional websites and user-created, amateur websites tended to contain interactive features, such as \\"clickable\\" links to online newspaper articles or favourite websites, the option to comment on content displayed on the website, the option to \\"tag\\" images, videos or links on the site, the option of \\"clicking\\" on an image to enlarge it or find out more information, the option of user participation for website guests to evaluate or review the pages, or even the option to create new user-generated content for others to see. A key difference between Web 1.0 personal webpages and Web 2.0 personal pages was while the former tended to be created by hackers, computer programmers and computer hobbyists, the latter were created by a much wider variety of users, including individuals whose main interests lay in hobbies or topics outside of computers (e.g., indie music fans, political activists, and social entrepreneurs). Motivations People may maintain personal web pages to serve as a showcase for their skills in professional life, creative skills or self promotion of their business, charity or band.Eight Clever Things You Can Do with Your Underused Personal Domain Name - lifehacker.com It can also be used to express opinions on issues ranging from news and politics to movies. Others may use their personal web page as a communication method. For example, an aspiring artist might give out business cards with their personal web page, and invite people to visit their page and see their artwork, \\"like\\" their page or sign their guestbook. A personal web page gives the owner generally more control on presence in search results and how they wish to be viewed online. It also allows more freedom in types and quantity of content than a social network profile offers, and can link various social media profiles with each other. It can be used to correct the record on something, or clear up potential confusion between you and someone with the same name.Motivation for: \\"A Web Page of One's Own\\" - WSJ.com -- http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121562102257039585.html In the 2010s, some amateur writers, bands and filmmakers release digital versions of their stories, songs and short films online, with the aim of gaining an audience and becoming more well-known. While the huge number of aspiring artists posting their work online makes it unlikely for individuals and groups to become popular via the Internet, there are a small number of YouTube stars who were unknown until their online performances garnered them a huge audience. Contrast with social network accounts Both individual, personal web sites and personal social networking accounts give the user a personally customized Web presence. In the 2010s most casual Internet users join free social networking services such as Twitter or Facebook to serve many of the same purposes as a personal webpage without having to learn web design and writing HTML markup. That prerequisite is not required, as Web hosting services provide more help to enable regular users to create Web pages.Create a free personal web page with Google -- \\"Get started with [free] Personal Web Pages\\" Social networks often used prefabricated \\"black box\\" structures. On one hand, these templates are much easier for neophyte users to work with, since users simply have to add in information in spaces which indicate the required information. Once the user \\"saves\\" or finishes entering the information, the social network website's software system automatically creates a fairly professional-looking layout. \\"Black box\\" templates are much simpler to begin using and navigating, but more advanced users may be frustrated that they cannot \\"tweak\\" the formatting, amount of content, type of content, etc. For example, most social networks have rules regarding casual users who are uploading (loading files onto the website) audio files to their account. Furthermore, these companies intentionally retain the specific service's look and feel and identity of each user personal account within that corporate social network. For example, all profiles may have the same background color, font and website trademark. The emphasis there is on being part of a branded \\"network,\\" not on the \\"personal,\\" or the individual. Thus, these accounts are not normally thought of as (personal) web sites or home pages. There are other differences. Unlike actual personal web pages, social networking services and ad-based \\"free\\" web hosting service personnel, advertisers and nanny-bots can see everything inside the user accounts, and rules are enforced by the firm, not by the courts as would be the case with a personally owned, full-featured personal web page. However some social services allow the display of almost any content or media produced by the site's creator. This avenue of distribution satisfies most amateurs and aspiring content creators. Web site creation tools permitted by some companies have the potential to allow users more flexibility. As a rule of thumb, the amount of creative freedom one is allowed in creating a personal Web page can be predicted by the site's URL. A pure URL similar to www.yourname.com predicts total ownership and the resulting rights. But a shared-name URL similar to www.yourname.home.othercompany.com suggests account rental and regulations which benefit or protect a corporation (in this case, Othercompany Inc). \\"Free\\" sites based on advertising revenue face the dilemma that while relaxation of the rules encourages users to post their feelings and opinions and upload user-generated content with less fear of being censored or shut down, it also increases the risk of an offended sponsor pulling its sponsorship, if offensive materials or comments are made online. With more uploading and content-posting freedom comes an increased risk of copyright and defamation lawsuits, hate speech charges and other legal problems. Free hosting services do not allow users many options to customize the look of pages, because this would reduce page uniformity, thus reducing the common \\"look and feel\\" on the website, which becomes a key part of its identity and \\"branding\\". In short, if a social networking company allowed total personal freedom of content posting and profile modification for users, it also risks a degradation of its own look-and-feel, branding, function, and profit and legal risks. In the 2010s, this balance of interests is leading toward more user choices and a narrowing of the differences between personal web sites and other personal web presence providers. Official celebrity sites Many celebrities from the movies, TV shows, professional sports and popular music have websites. Were their owners not famous, some might think due to their tone and personal ambiance that these sites were personal web pages. However, the celebrity is the \\"product\\" or brand being sold, and however casual a celebrity website may appear, with short blog posts and comments appearing on a regular basis, these are typically professionally authored and maintained. Some celebrities' public relations firms and managers hire ghostwriters to author blog posts and Tweets in the style of the celebrity. The celebrity status of the subject and the existence of separate fan-created sites (over which the celebrity in question has no direct control) leads the existence of multiple websites for each celebrity: a personal site authorized by the celebrity and maintained by an individual or company directly associated with the celebrity to be labeled an \\"official website\\", and one or more fan-run websites. This designation is often a seal of approval and an assurance to the public that the information provided on the site (including press releases, tour dates, and promotional materials) has been authored or approved by the celebrity in question. Some celebrities involved in criminal and civil trials, such as late pop star Michael Jackson and media mogul Martha Stewart, as well as celebrity chef Paula Deen establish official websites to issue statements to the press and to respond to statements and press releases issued by the prosecuting officials. Most celebrity sites are created and maintained by marketing and web professionals employed by the celebrity or the celebrity's publicist; however, some celebrities, such as film director Roger Avary, actor Wil Wheaton, and video game developer John Romero, maintain their own official sites without professional help, although many of them still use third-party templates and blogging software. Sites of academics Academic professionals (especially at the college and university level), including professors and researchers, are often given online space for creating and storing personal web documents, including personal web pages, CVs and a list of their books, academic papers and conference presentations, on the websites of their employers. This goes back to the early decade of the World Wide Web and its original purpose of providing a quick and easy way for academics to share research papers and data. Researchers may have a personal website to share more information about themselves, about their academic activities and for sharing (unpublished) results of their research. This has been noted as part of the success of open-access repositories such as arXiv.M√°s-Bleda, Amalia, and Isidro F. Aguillo. \\"Can a personal website be useful as an information source to assess individual scientists? The case of European highly cited researchers.\\" Scientometrics 96.1 (2013): 51-67.

It is located on the Joondalup line, from Perth station serving the suburb of Warwick. History Prior to the commissioning of the site as a railway station, the location was originally a bus interchange known as the Warwick Bus Station. Opened in 1987, Accessed at Battye Library, Perth. it was similar in design and appearance to facilities constructed at Mirrabooka and Rockingham for the same purpose. It provided services connecting the Perth central business district to bus routes servicing the then rapidly expanding northern suburbs. The site also contains a privately operated day care centre which remains in operation as of September 2019.Accessed at Battye Library, Perth The original bus station was connected to the adjoining Mitchell Freeway by a two-lane on/off ramp in both the north and south directions, constructed in the middle of the Mitchell Freeway reserve. It was constructed to service freeway express buses from Perth, services which were subsequently phased out with the opening of the railway station. pages 2, 20 Accessed at J S Battye Library, Perth The on/off ramp was connected to the bus station via a bridge spanning the southbound lanes of the Freeway. The bus station was positioned on land north of the connecting bridge between the Freeway East Embankment (controlled by the Main Roads Department), Hawker Avenue, land occupied by the Warwick chapel of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and adjoining residential housing. =Design and construction= At the time of the station's design, it was recognised by The Urban Rail Electrification Committee that the placement of bus services in close proximity or direct connection to rail infrastructure was of significant importance. This was evidenced by the Kelmscott and Armadale stations, and the then recently completed Cannington station. Under the Northern Suburbs Transit System Project, construction on the station was scheduled to commence on 16 November 1991, with completion expected by the end of December 1992. Whitfords station being of a very similar design was scheduled for construction in synchronisation with Warwick station. The station was to include a number of facilities, including a bus concourse to connect with feeder bus services, information booths and offices for railway staff, amenities and services, as well as access services for mobility-impaired passengers in line with design requirements of the time. Further to this, pieces of the Passenger Information Network installed at the station included previously unseen electronic displays on the upper bus decks designed to provide drivers with information so they could connect with appointed trains or communicate with bus depot control in the event of delays. Passenger information systems across the network are currently being upgraded as part of the improvements being delivered under the New MetroRail Project. Pg. 8 Car parking spaces were also included as part of the construction project, which included a significant number of on-grade parking bays on the eastern side of the station for commuter use. The design of the station also allowed for the possible extension of the upper bus deck in a southward direction towards Beach Road. This extension would provide for five additional regular bus bays, as well as additional pedestrian access if required.Section 3.2, Accessed at J S Battye Library, Perth As part of the construction of the new railway station the on/off ramps used for buses were demolished; however the original bridge over the southbound lanes was retained to provide upper-level bus station access. A pedestrian pathway was added to the bridge to enable pedestrian movements across to the easy side of the station from a new footbridge linking to Methuen Way, Duncraig. The most interesting part of the station was the upper bus deck. The deck was constructed of precast concrete that was formed off site, which was then transported to the site before being placed atop columns constructed as part of the stations foundations. Precast concrete flooring was then put in place, held in specially formed ridges running the length of the beams. This upper deck was the most expensive structural element of the station, and was the cause of significant attention and consideration as part of the design and construction process.

This and associated concepts have been the subject of considerable research, debate, and discussion among experts in several disciplines and has generated controversy within the medical, scientific, and gaming communities. Such disorders can be diagnosed when an individual engages in gaming activities at the cost of fulfilling daily responsibilities or pursuing other interests without regard for the negative consequences. The World Health Organization included gaming disorder in the 11th revision of its International Classification of Diseases (ICD). 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. The American Psychiatric Association (APA), while stating there is insufficient evidence for the inclusion of Internet gaming disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in 2013, considered it worthy of further study. Controversy around the diagnosis includes whether the disorder is a separate clinical entity or a manifestation of underlying psychiatric disorders. Research has approached the question from a variety of viewpoints, with no universally standardized or agreed definitions, leading to difficulties in developing evidence-based recommendations.  Definition and diagnosis  In its report, the Council on Science and Public Health to the American Medical Association (AMA) used this two-hour-per-day limit to define \\"gaming overuse\\", citing the American Academy of Pediatrics guideline of no more than one to two hours per day of \\"screen time\\". However, the ESA document cited in the Council report does not contain the two-hour-per-day data. =American Psychiatric Association= While the American Psychiatric Association (APA) does not recognise video game addiction as a disorder, in light of existing evidence, the organisation included video game addiction as a \\"condition requiring further study\\" in the DSM-5 as Internet gaming disorder. Video game addiction is a broader concept than internet gaming addiction, but most video game addiction is associated with internet gaming. APA suggests, like Khan, the effects (or symptoms) of video game addiction may be similar to those of other proposed psychological addictions. Video game addiction may be an impulse control disorder, similar to compulsive gambling The APA explains why Internet Gaming Disorder has been proposed as a disorder: > This decision was based upon the large number of studies of this condition > and the severity of its consequences. ... Because of the distinguishing > features and increased risks of clinically significant problems associated > with gaming in particular, the Workgroup recommended the inclusion of only > internet gaming disorder in Section 3 of the DSM-5. Some players become more concerned with their interactions in the game than in their broader lives. Players may play many hours per day, neglect personal hygiene, gain or lose significant weight, disrupt sleep patterns resulting in sleep deprivation, play at work, avoid phone calls from friends, or lie about how much time they spend playing video games. The APA has developed nine criteria for characterising the proposed Internet Gaming Disorder: # Pre- occupation. Do you spend a lot of time thinking about games even when you are not playing, or planning when you can play next? # Withdrawal. Do you feel restless, irritable, moody, angry, anxious or sad when attempting to cut down or stop gaming, or when you are unable to play? # Tolerance. Do you feel the need to play for increasing amounts of time, play more exciting games, or use more powerful equipment to get the same amount of excitement you used to get? # Reduce/stop. Do you feel that you should play less, but are unable to cut back on the amount of time you spend playing games? # Give up other activities. Do you lose interest in or reduce participation in other recreational activities due to gaming? # Continue despite problems. Do you continue to play games even though you are aware of negative consequences, such as not getting enough sleep, being late to school/work, spending too much money, having arguments with others, or neglecting important duties? # Deceive/cover up. Do you lie to family, friends or others about how much you game, or try to keep your family or friends from knowing how much you game? # Escape adverse moods. Do you game to escape from or forget about personal problems, or to relieve uncomfortable feelings such as guilt, anxiety, helplessness or depression? # Risk/lose relationships/opportunities. Do you risk or lose significant relationships, or job, educational or career opportunities because of gaming? One of the most commonly used instruments for the measurement of addiction, the PVP Questionnaire (Problem Video Game Playing Questionnaire), was presented as a quantitative measure, not as a diagnostic tool. According to Griffiths, \\"all addictions (whether chemical or behavioral) are essentially about constant rewards and reinforcement\\". He proposes that addiction has six components: salience, mood modification, tolerance, withdrawal, conflict, and relapse. But the APA's nine criteria for diagnosing Internet Gaming Disorder were made by taking point of departure in eight different diagnostic/measuring tools proposed in other studies. Thus, the APA's criteria attempt to condense the scientific work on diagnosing Internet Gaming Disorder. = World Health Organization = The World Health Organization (WHO) had proposed and later included \\"gaming disorder\\" in the 11th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-11), released in June 2018, which was approved by the World Health Assembly in May 2019. the use and enforcement of ICD-11 is expected to start on 1 January 2022. = Screening tools = The first psychometric test to assess IGD was the Internet Gaming Disorder Test (IGD-20). This test includes 20 questions designed to assess the extent of problems caused by disordered gaming and the degree of symptoms experienced by gamers. The test was first published in a journal article published in the PLoS ONE journal on 14 October 2014. The Internet Gaming Disorder Scale‚ÄìShort- Form (IGDS9-SF) is a short psychometric test to assess video game addiction according to the American Psychiatric Association framework for IGD. Recent review studies suggest that the IGDS9-SF presents with robust empirical and clinical evidence and is an effective tool to assess IGD. Moreover, the scale was adapted in several languages as Spanish, Chinese, Czech, German, and so many more. On 3 June 2019, a screening tool for Gaming Disorder, specifically as defined by the World Health Organization, called the \\"Gaming Disorder Test\\" was published in a journal article. Risk factors The Internet can foster various addictions including addiction to game-playing. Addictive playing of MMORPGs is associated with negative effects, whereas normal play is not. Younger people and men are more likely to experience a gaming disorder than older people and women respectively. Adolescents are at a higher risk of sustaining video game disorder over time than adults. An international meta- analysis over 34 jurisdictions quantified the effect size of gender as small, with most effect in Asia, lesser in Europe and Africa, and null in North America, and further finding that economic factors, internet availability, social norms and addiction-related health factors mediate the effect of gender, with nations with a greater GDP per capita having less differences in video game addiction between genders. Comorbid psychiatric disorders act as both risk factors and consequences. Indeed, there is a strong association between video game addiction and anxiety, depression, ADHD, social phobia, and poor psycho-social support. ADHD and its symptoms, such as impulsivity and conduct problems, also increase risks of developing video game disorder. Although internet gaming disorder has a strong relationship with obsessive- compulsive disorder, it is not specific and internet gaming disorder is both phenomenologically and neurobiologically distinct, which indicates that internet gaming disorder is more characterized by impulsivity than compulsivity. Familial factors appear to play an important role, although not well understood. Some personality traits, such as high neuroticism, high impulsivity, and high aggressiveness are consistently significant predictors of internet gaming disorder, and combination of personality traits seem to play a pivotal role in the acquisition, maintenance and development of the disorder.  Mechanisms  Video game on a keypad mobile Although there is much research since the 1980s on problematic online gaming use, the mechanisms are not well understood, due to inconsistent definitions used in studies. = Video game structure = Some theories focus on the presumed built-in reward systems of video games, such as compulsion loops, to explain their potentially addictive nature. The anticipation of such rewards can create a neurological reaction that releases dopamine into the body, so that once the reward is obtained, the person will remember it as a pleasurable feeling. This has been found to be similar to the neurological reaction of other behavioral addictions such as substance abuse and gambling disorder, although not to the same magnitude and with some differences. Mark Griffiths has proposed another reason online video games are potentially addictive is because they \\"can be played all day every day.\\" The fact there is no end to the game can feel rewarding for some, and hence players are further engaged in the game. = Addiction circuits in the brain = Long-term internet video/mobile game playing affects brain regions responsible for reward, impulse control and sensory-motor coordination. Structural analyses shown modifications in the volume of the ventral striatum, possibly as result of changes in rewards, and video game addicts had faulty inhibitory control and reward mechanisms. Video game playing is associated with dopamine release similar in magnitude to that of drug abuse, and the presentation of gaming pictures activates brain regions similarly to drug pictures for drug addicts. Treatment studies which used fMRI to monitor the brain connectivity changes found a decrease in the activity of the regions associated with cravings. Although there are evidences that video game addiction may be supported by similar neural mechanisms underlying drug abuse, as video game and internet addictions reduce the sensitivity of the dopaminergic reward system, it is still premature to conclude that this addiction is equivalent to substance addictions, as the research is in its early stages. There is evidence of a dual processing model of digital technology addictions characterized by an imbalance between the reactive and the reflective reward systems. Other studies shown increased difficulties in decision making in specific contexts, such as risky situations but not in ambiguous situations, and an increased preference for short-term rewards. Although the number of neuroimaging studies on internet gaming disorder is rising, there are several methodological shortcomings, particularly in the inconsistency of psychometric assessments. Furthermore, the conclusions on reduced inhibition should be moderated, as only one study included a functional control, which then showed no difference in inhibition. A meta- analytic review of the research concluded the evidence suggests video game addiction arises out of other mental health problems, rather than causing them. Thus it is unclear whether video game addiction should be considered a unique diagnosis.  Management  As concern over video game addiction grows, the use of psychopharmacology, psychotherapy, twelve-step programs, and use of continuing developing treatment enhancements have been proposed to treat this disorder. Empirical studies indeed indicate that internet gaming disorder is associated with detrimental health-related outcomes. However, the clinical trials of potential treatments remain of low quality, except for cognitive- behavioral therapies, which shows efficacy to reduce gaming disorder and depressive symptoms but not total time spent. Although there is a scientific consensus that cognitive-behavioral therapy is preferable to pharmacological treatment, it remains difficult to make definitive statements about its benefits and efficiency due to methodological inconsistencies and lack of follow-up. Since efficacious treatments have not been well established, prevention of video gaming disorder is crucial. Some evidence suggest that up to 50% of people affected by the internet gaming disorder may recover naturally. Some countries, such as South Korea, China, the Netherlands, Canada, and the United States, have responded to the perceived threat of video game addiction by opening treatment centres. = China = China was the first country to treat \\"internet addiction\\" clinically in 2008. The Chinese government operates several clinics to treat those who overuse online games, chatting and web surfing. Treatment for the patients, most of whom have been forced to attend by parents or government officials, includes various forms of pain including shock therapy. In August 2009, Deng Sanshan was reportedly beaten to death in a correctional facility for video game and Web addiction. access-date=12 March 2017 archive- url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130909051616/http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/01/ff_internetaddiction/ archive-date=9 September 2013 url-status=live }} Most of the addiction \\"boot camps\\" in China are actually extralegal militaristically managed centers, but have remained popular despite growing controversy over their practices. In 2019, China set up a curfew, banning minors from playing between certain hours. = Netherlands = In June 2006, the Smith and Jones clinic in Amsterdam‚Äîwhich has now gone bankrupt‚Äîbecame the first treatment facility in Europe to offer a residential treatment program for compulsive gamers. Keith Bakker, founder and former head of the clinic, has stated that 90% of the young people who seek treatment for compulsive computer gaming are not addicted. = Canada = At a Computer Addiction Services center in Richmond, British Columbia, excessive gaming accounts for 80% of one youth counselor's caseload.Bennett, Nelson. When the game gets serious. Richmond News 8 December 2006. Retrieved 25 June 2007. = United Kingdom = In 2018, the National Health Service announced its plans to open a treatment center, run by the Central and North West London NHS foundation trust, that will initially focus on gaming disorder, but is planned to expand to cover other internet-based addictions. The specialist treatment center opened in 2019 for treating adolescents and young people aged 13‚Äì25 who are addicted to video games.  Outcomes = Mental health = Internet gaming disorder is associated with increased anxiety, social phobia and depression, with adults and young adults being more affected than adolescents. = Physical health = The most frequent physical health-related outcome are alterations in physical functioning such as somatisation and sleep disturbances. Preliminary evidence suggest that internet gaming disorder and the induced sedentarity may contribute to a lack of physical exercise, even though the relationship is not causal.  Epidemiology  The prevalence of internet gaming disorder range from 0.7% to 27.5% worldwide, or 1.0% to 26.8% worldwide, and 3.5% to 17% in China, and is higher among males than females and among younger than older people, with geographical region making little difference. A longer time spent on video games predicts a tendency towards pathological gaming in the future. The studies however used various methodologies and definitions, which renders consensus difficult to achieve and may explain the wide range of prevalence.  Research = Debates on the classification = A meta-analytic review of pathological gaming studies concluded that about 3% of gamers may experience some symptoms of pathological gaming. The report noted problems in the field with defining and measuring pathological gaming and concluded that pathological gaming behaviors were more likely the product of underlying mental health problems rather than the inverse. Barnett and Coulson expressed concern that much of the debate on the issue of addiction may be a knee jerk response stimulated by poor understanding of games and game players. Such issues may lead both society and scholars to exaggerate the prevalence and nature of problematic gaming, and over-focus on games specifically, while ignoring underlying mental health issues. Other scholars have cautioned that comparing the symptoms of problematic gaming with problematic gambling is flawed, and that such comparisons may introduce research artifacts and artificially inflate prevalence estimates. For instance, Richard Wood has observed that behaviors which are problematic in regards to gambling may not be as problematic when put into the context of other behaviors that are rewarding such as gaming. Similarly, Barnett and Coulson have cautioned that discussions of problematic gaming have moved forward prematurely without proper understanding of the symptoms, proper assessment and consequences. Rather than video gaming disorder being a subtype of gambling disorder, a majority of researchers support the idea of video game addiction being a part of a more comprehensive framework of impulse control disorders with \\"pathological technology use\\" with similar characteristics, including the pathological use of video games, internet, computers and other interactive medias. Although internet and video game addictions are generally considered different from gambling disorder and substance abuse, there is a growing body of evidence indicating they share common features, including behavioral and neural features. Indeed, it is suggested that while behavioral addiction may differ with drug addictions in magnitude, they share several characteristics, with Hellman et al proposing that the concept of addiction should be de- medicalized. On the contrary, a literature review found that as the video game addiction develops, online gaming addicts spend increasing amounts of time not only playing but also preparing for and organizing their playing sessions, suggesting this addiction may be behavioral rather than a disorder of impulse control. There is recent evidence suggesting that internet gaming disorder can cause two distinct types of dysfunctions: cognitive and metacognitive. Griffiths has suggested that psycho-social dependence may revolve around the intermittent reinforcements in the game and the need to belong. Hagedorn & Young have suggested that social dependence may arise due to video games occurring online where players interact with others and the relationships \\"often become more important for gamers than real-life relationships\\". = Controversy and alternative viewpoints = Common challenges involve the reliability of the methodology and validity of the results in some studies. Many rely on self-surveys from university students and also lack time frames making it difficult to study the impact, if any, of addiction on a long term scale. Other concerns also address the definition of addiction and how to measure it, questioning whether or not time is a proper unit to determine how addicted someone is to gaming. Daria Joanna Kuss and Mark D. Griffiths have argued the current scientific knowledge on internet gaming addiction is copious in scope and complexity. They state that instead, a simple framework should be provided to allow all current and future studies to be categorised, as internet gaming addiction lies on a continuum beginning with etiology and risk factors all the way through the development of \\"full-blown\\" addiction and ending with ramifications and potential treatment. In addition, they caution the deployment of the label \\"addiction\\" since it heavily denotes the use of substances or engagement in certain behaviors. Finally, the researcher promotes other researchers to assess the validity and reliability of existing measures instead of developing additional measurement instruments. Other challenges include the lack of context of the participant's life and the negative portrayal of gaming addicts. Some state that gamers sometimes use video games to either escape from an uncomfortable environment or alleviate their already existing mental issues‚Äîboth possibly important aspects in determining the psychological impact of gaming. Negative portrayal also deals with the lack of consistency in measuring addictive gaming. This leads to discussions that sometimes exaggerate the issue and create a misconception in some that they, themselves, may be addicted when they are not. The evidence of video game addiction to create withdrawal symptoms is very limited and thus debated, due to different definitions and low quality trials. The concept of video game disorder is itself being debated, with the overlap of its symptoms with other mental disorders, the unclear consensus on a definition and thresholds, and the lack of evidence raising doubts on whether or not this qualifies as a mental disorder of its own. Despite the lack of a unified definition, there is an emerging consensus among studies that Internet gaming disorder is mainly defined by three features: 1) withdrawal, 2) loss of control, and 3) conflict. Although the DSM-5 definition of video game disorder has a good fit to current methodological definitions used in trials and studies, there are still debates on the clinical pertinence. Michael Brody, M.D., head of the TV and Media Committee of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, stated in a 2007 press release that \\"... there is not enough research on whether or not video games are addictive.\\" However, Brody also cautioned that for some children and adolescents, \\"... it displaces physical activity and time spent on studies, with friends, and even with family.\\" A major issue concerns the lack of consistent measures and definitions and of acquisition of follow-up data. Furthermore, the study design quality has not greatly improved between the 2000s and 2017. For instance, most studies measured internet gaming behaviors in terms of frequency of use (total time spent), without considering the type of game (e.g., MMORPG), the social context (e.g., physically or virtually with friends), nor the motivations (e.g., competitive, achievement-oriented \\"grinding\\"). Although the amount of time spent was postulated by Johanssonn and G√∂testam in 2004 to lead to pathological behaviors, it is unclear whether the time spent is a cause or a consequence of pathological use. These criticisms, however, mostly pertain to Western research since there is more data of higher quality available in Asian regions, where the Internet gaming disorder is more prevalent. A survey conducted in 2019 of 214 scholars shown that 60.8% agreed that pathological video game use could be a mental health problems, whereas 30.4% were skeptical. However, only 49.7% agreed with the DSM-5 definition of Internet gaming disorder, and 56.5% to the definition of the World Health Organization. Most scholars were worried that WHO's and DSM-5's inclusion of Internet gaming disorder was \\"overpathologizing normal youth\\" and \\"precipitated moral panic over video games\\". This indicates a lack of consensus on the issue .  History  Video game addiction has been studied since the 1980s, and has seen a significant increase in the number of empirical studies since then. The press has reported concerns over online gaming since at least 1994, when Wired mentioned a college student who was playing a MUD game for 12 hours a day instead of attending class. Press reports have noted that some Finnish Defence Forces' conscripts were not mature enough to meet the demands of military life and were required to interrupt or postpone military service for a year. One reported source of the lack of needed social skills is overuse of computer games or the internet. Forbes termed this overuse \\"Web fixations\\" and stated they were responsible for 13 such interruptions or deferrals over the five years from 2000 to 2005. In an April 2008 article, The Daily Telegraph reported that surveys of 391 players of Asheron's Call showed that three percent of respondents suffered from agitation when they were unable to play, or missed sleep or meals to play. The article reports that University of Bolton lead researcher John Charlton said, \\"Our research supports the idea that people who are heavily involved in game playing may be nearer to autistic spectrum disorders than people who have no interest in gaming.\\" On 6 March 2009, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's (CBC) national news magazine program the fifth estate aired an hour-long report on video game addiction and the Brandon Crisp story, titled \\"Top Gun\\", subtitled \\"When a video gaming obsession turns to addiction and tragedy.\\" In August 2010, Wired reported that a man in Hawaii, Craig Smallwood, sued the gaming company NCSoft for negligence and for not specifying that their game, Lineage II, was so addictive. He alleged he would not have begun playing if he was aware he would become addicted. Smallwood says he has played Lineage for 20,000 hours between 2004 and 2009. In 2013, a man from China observed his son's addiction to video games, and having studied these conditions for 25 years, decided to take action. He hired online assassins to kill his son's virtual avatar every time he logged in. He hoped that being relentlessly killed would help his son lose interest in this destructive habit. = Inclusion in the ICD-11 = In the draft versions leading to the final ICD-11 document, gaming disorder was included alongside gambling disorder under \\"Disorders Due to Addictive Behaviors\\". The addition defines as \\"a pattern of persistent or recurrent gaming behaviour ('digital gaming' or 'video-gaming')\\", defined by three criteria: the lack of control over playing video games, priority given to video games over other interests, and the inability to stop playing video games even after being affected by negative consequences. For gaming disorder to be diagnosed, the behavior pattern must be of sufficient severity to result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning and would normally have been evident for at least 12 months. Research shows gaming disorders can be associated with anxiety, depression, loneliness, obesity, sleeping disorders, attention problems, and stress. Vladimir Poznyak, the coordinator for the WHO Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse, defended the addition of gaming disorder, believing the backlash against the addition to be a moral panic as they chose a very narrow definition that encompasses only the most extreme cases of gaming disorder. He said evaluating a disorder for inclusion is nominally done without any external feedback \\"to avoid interference from commercial and other entities which may have vested interest in the outcome of the process\\". Dr. Poznyak asserted that several medical professionals consulting on the ICD-11 did believe gaming disorder to be real, and by including it in the ICD-11, there can now be earnest efforts to define its causes and symptoms betters and methods to deal with it, and now include the video game industry within the conversation to help reduce the effects of video games on public health. The addition of \\"gaming disorder\\" to the ICD-11 was criticized by gamers and the video game industry, while some researchers remained skeptical. Some of these researchers said the evidence remains weak and \\"there is a genuine risk of abuse of diagnoses.\\" A group of 26 scholars wrote an open letter to the WHO, suggesting that the proposed diagnostic categories lacked scientific merit and were likely to do more harm than good. In counter-argument, a group of fifty academic researchers in behavioral science agreed that the evidence to support gaming disorder was weak, but it would be best that WHO identify gaming disorder in ICD-11 so that it could be considered a clinical and public health need. A report, prepared by mental health experts at Oxford University, Johns Hopkins University, Stockholm University and the University of Sydney, sponsored by The Association for UK Interactive Entertainment argues that while there may be potential addiction associated with video gaming, it is premature to consider it a disorder without further study, given the stigmatisation that surrounds video, and ask the WHO to use caution when finalising the ICD draft. This report was promoted by 22 video game industry trade organizations including the Entertainment Software Association of the United States and Interactive Software Federation of Europe As the final approval of the ICD-11 neared, several video game trade associations issued a statement requesting WHO to reconsider the addition of \\"gaming disorder\\", stating that, \\"The evidence for its inclusion remains highly contested and inconclusive\\". The Entertainment Software Association had meetings with the WHO during December 2018 to try to convince them to hold off including gaming disorder within ICD-11, with more planned meetings to follow.  Society and culture = Parental concerns = According to ABC News, parents have many concerns about their children playing video games, including concerns about age appropriateness, the amount of time spent playing games, physical health, and aggressive behaviour. = Governmental concerns = The first video game to attract political controversy was the 1978 arcade game Space Invaders. In 1981, a political bill called the Control of Space Invaders (and other Electronic Games) Bill was drafted by British Labour Party MP George Foulkes in an attempt to ban the game for its \\"addictive properties\\" and for causing \\"deviancy\\". The bill was debated and only narrowly defeated in parliament by 114 votes to 94 votes. In August 2005, the government of the People's Republic of China, where more than 20 million people play online games, introduced an online gaming restriction limiting playing time to three hours, after which the player would be expelled from whichever game they were playing. In 2006, it relaxed the rule so only citizens under the age of 18 would face the limitation. Reports indicate underage gamers found ways to circumvent the measure. In July 2007, the rule was relaxed yet again. Internet games operating in China must require users identify themselves by resident identity numbers. After three hours, players under 18 are prompted to stop and \\"do suitable physical exercise\\". If they continue, their in-game points are \\"slashed in half\\". After five hours, all their points are automatically erased. In 2008, one of the five Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Commissioners, Deborah Taylor Tate, stated that online gaming addiction was \\"one of the top reasons for college drop-outs\\". However, she did not mention a source for the statement nor identify its position in relation to other top reasons. In 2011, the South Korean government implemented a law, known as the Shutdown law or the Cinderella Law, which prohibits children under the age of 16 from playing online video games between the hours of 12:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. However, as of 2014, the law was amended and now children under the age of 16 can play after midnight if they have permission from their parents. A systematic review identified in 2017 three types of currently attempted governmental policies: 1) limiting the availability of video games (shutdown, fatigue system, parental controls), 2) reduce the risks and harm (warning messages), 3) provide addiction help services to gamers. Most of these policies were either not as efficient as intended or not yet evaluated for efficiency, which lead some researchers to prompt for a global public health approach to prevent the onset and progression of this disorder. Some researchers suggest that the video game industry should itself place preventive measures against video game addiction. = Deaths = There have been at least a few deaths caused directly by exhaustion from playing games for excessive periods of time.  China  In 2005, thirteen-year-old Zhang Xiaoyi committed suicide by jumping from the top of a 24-story tower block in his home province of Tianjin. After previously having spent two straight days playing online role-playing games in an Internet cafe, Zhang had told his parents that he had \\"been poisoned by games and could no longer control himself\\". The head of a software association said to gaming website Play.tm that same year: \\"In the hypothetical world created by such games, [players] become confident and gain satisfaction, which they cannot get in the real world.\\" In 2007, a 26-year-old man identified only as \\"Zhang\\" died of a heart attack due to lack of physical activity following a seven-day gaming binge, while a 30-year-old man died in a Guangzhou Internet cafe after playing online games for three straight days.  South Korea  In 2005, 28-year old industrial repairman Seungseob Lee (Hangul: Ïù¥ÏäπÏÑ≠) visited an Internet cafe in the city of Daegu and played StarCraft almost continuously for fifty hours. He went into cardiac arrest and died at a local hospital. A friend reported: \\"... he was a game addict. We all knew about it. He couldn't stop himself.\\" About six weeks before his death, his girlfriend, also an avid gamer, broke up with him. In addition, he was fired from his job. In 2009, Kim Sa-rang, a 3-month-old Korean child, died from malnutrition after both her parents spent hours each day in an Internet cafe, rearing a virtual child in an online game, Prius Online. The death is covered in the 2014 documentary Love Child.  United States  In November 2001, Shawn Woolley committed suicide; it has been inferred that his death was related to the popular computer game EverQuest. Shawn's mother said the suicide was due to a rejection or betrayal in the game from a character Shawn called \\"iluvyou\\". Ohio teenager Daniel Petric shot his parents, killing his mother, after they took away his copy of Halo 3 in October 2007. In a sentencing hearing after the teen was found guilty of aggravated murder, the judge said, \\"I firmly believe that Daniel Petric had no idea at the time he hatched this plot that if he killed his parents they would be dead forever.\\" On 16 June 2009, Petric was sentenced to 23 years to life in prison.

She is one of the most prominent and successful artists in the history of contemporary Indigenous Australian art. Life and family  VH-ZND Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner, Qantas aircraft is named Emily Kame Kngwarreye and painted in a special livery based on her work Yam Dreaming Knwarreye was born 1910 on Alhalkere, a member of the Anmatyerre language group. Knwarreye lived at the Utopia community, which was established in 1978, about northeast of Alice Springs in the Northern Territory of Australia. Emily had one brother and one sister, and no children of her own. Her brother's children are Gloria Pitjana Mills and Dolly Pitjana Mills. Her sister-in-law was Minnie Pwerle, mother of artist Barbara Weir, whom Kngwarreye partly raised. Kngwarreye did not take up painting seriously until she was nearly 80, after over a decade of working in the batik medium. Kngwarreye died in Alice Springs in September 1996. Early art Kngwarreye's initial artistic training was as a traditional Aboriginal woman, preparing and using designs for women's ceremonies. Her training in western techniques began, along with that of the rest of the Utopia community, with batik. Her first batik cloth works were created in 1980. Later she moved from batik to painting on canvas: > I did batik at first, and then after doing that I learned more and more and > then I changed over to painting for good...Then it was canvas. I gave up > on...fabric to avoid all the boiling to get the wax out. I got a bit lazy ‚Äì > I gave it up because it was too much hard work. I finally got sick of it ... > I didn't want to continue with the hard work batik required ‚Äì boiling the > fabric over and over, lighting fires, and using up all the soap powder, over > and over. That's why I gave up batik and changed over to canvas ‚Äì it was > easier. My eyesight deteriorated as I got older, and because of that I gave > up batik on silk ‚Äì it was better for me to just paint. Acrylic paintings were introduced to Utopia in 1988/89 by Rodney Gooch and others of the Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association (CAAMA). An exhibition of some of the paintings of these artists' work organised by CAAMA was held called \\"A Summer Project\\", where Kngwarreye's work got immediate attention from critics. The attention she received coincided with the worldwide art boom that occurred at this time. Whereas the predominant Aboriginal style was based on the one developed with some assistance from art teacher Geoffrey Bardon at the Papunya community in 1971 of many similarly sized dots carefully lying next to each other in distinct patterns, Kngwarreye created her own original artistic style. This first style, in her paintings between 1989 and 1991, had many dots, sometimes lying on top of each other, of varying sizes and colours, as seen in Wild Potato Dreaming (1996). Initially Kngwarreye painted for CAAMA and the Holt family at Delmore Downs Station; by 1991 she was producing many works for the Aboriginal Gallery of Dreamings in Melbourne as well as Fred Torres of Dacou located in Adelaide. These original paintings of different styles quickly went for high prices at auction, with a revenue for the Utopia group of painters of more than million in 1989/90. The first international solo exhibition of Kngwarreye was held at the Oude Kerk, Amsterdam in 1999 by the Aboriginal Gallery of Dreamings. Styles Kngwarreye went through many different individual styles in her short career as a professional painter. In 1992, she began to join the dots into lines with parallel horizontal and vertical stripes, representing rivers and terrain, in many different colours. She began using larger brushes than previously. Her later paintings were based on much larger dots than the finer, more intricate work which she did when she started. In 1993 she began painting patches of colour along with many dots, which were like rings that were clear in the middle as seen in Alaqura Profusion (1993). This was made with a shaving brush that was called her 'dump dump' style, which used very bright colours. The same style of rings of colour are also seen in My Mothers Country and Emu Country (1994). In 1995 she ended what critics called her 'colourist' phase and began painting with plain stripes that crossed the canvas. The originally thick stripes often represented the lines of yam tracks, as in Yam Dreaming (1994) and Bush Yam (1995). She expressed the strange growth patterns of the yam, a plant which was critical for human survival in the desert, but was very difficult to find. Later in 1995 her paintings started to resemble in some ways the American abstract expressionist paintings of Jackson Pollock, with many thinner lines that criss-crossed the canvas. Her main theme continued to be yams, as in Yam Dreaming Awelye (1995) and also in black-and-white Yam Dreaming paintings. Several weeks before her death, Kngwarreye painted many canvases over a 3-day period in 1996, using a very thick brush, as in Body Paint (1996). =Yam dreaming= Kngwarreye particularly featured yam tracks in her works. The yam plant was an important source of food for the Aboriginal people of the desert. She painted many works on this theme; often her first actions at the start of a painting were to put down the yam tracking lines. This plant was especially significant for her: her middle name, Kame, means the yellow flower of the yam that grows above the ground. She described her paintings as having meaning based on all the aspects of the community's life, including the yam plants. Success Eight paintings by Kngwarreye in the Sotheby's winter auction of 2000 put together were sold for , with Awelye (1989) selling for . Also in 2000, Kngwarreye's work was amongst that of eight individual and collaborative groups of Indigenous Australian artists shown in the prestigious Nicholas Hall at the Hermitage Museum in Russia. The exhibition received a positive reception from Russian critics, one of whom wrote: > This is an exhibition of contemporary art, not in the sense that it was done > recently, but in that it is cased in the mentality, technology and > philosophy of radical art of the most recent times. No one, other than the > Aborigines of Australia, has succeeded in exhibiting such art at the > Hermitage. On 23 May 2007, her 1994 painting Earth's Creation was purchased by Tim Jennings of Mbantua Gallery & Cultural Museum for at a Deutscher-Menzies' Sydney auction, setting a record for an Aboriginal artwork at that time. In 2017 Earth's Creation sold again for at a Cooee Art Gallery auction, breaking its own record. Exploitation With success came unwanted attention. Many other inexperienced art dealers would go to her community to try to get a piece of the action, Kngwarreye once describing to a friend how she had \\"escaped from five or six carloads of 'wannabe' art dealers at Utopia\\". According to Sotheby's Tim Klingender, Kngwarreye was \\"an example of an Aboriginal artist who was relentlessly pursued by carpetbaggers towards the end of her career and produced a large but inconsistent body of work.\\" Exhibitions and gallery holdings  Kngwarreye's first solo exhibition was at Utopia Art Sydney in April 1990. There have been retrospectives at the National Museum of Australia, the Niagara Galleries, and the Adelaide Festival Centre. In 2013 the Emily Museum, the first museum featuring a single Aboriginal artist, opened in Cheltenham, Victoria.

Gafsele was founded by the Nils Andersson from Finland and his wife Brita in 1674. Nils arrived from Finland (that was a part of Sweden at the time) as he wanted to avoid being drafted into the war with Russia. Instead, he worked his way up the Angerman river until he reached Lapland, where the government promised any man that settled to be tax-free for 10 years. At that time, Lapplander (Sami) people already lived in the area, but as they were raising reindeers and Nils was farming, they could live together mainly without conflict. Nils and his wife Brita are said to bring one cow, that they kept during the summer on a small island in the river called Koholmen (small cow island). Before the winter they built a small cottage on what is now called Skoludden, and settled. Brita, Nils wife was famous for her hot temper and for bringing some non-Christian behaviors to the village, such as blessings of the crops, and was brought to justice for this, but Nils talked the court out of it. It could otherwise have been fatal, as the penalty for such behavior in principle was death. The most famous story about Nils is the day he saw a small splinter coming down the river and he understood that there was some other settler upstream. He immediately went there and scared the person off, as he believed that everything upstream belonged to him. Later, of course, more settlements were done upstreams, but Gafsele remained one of the bigger. Today Gafsele has seen its heyday, and have a population of around 120 people, most engaged with forestry, farming, working for the municipality or retirees. There is one potato farmer and one cow farmer. The village is spread out on both sides of the √Öngerman river, with a bridge built 1967 in between. Near the bridge, on the east side, is the community house of the village, and on the west side you can visit the old sawmill that is still functional. Both places are open for many activities during the year. Most popular sports in the village is fishing, hunting, and snow mobile riding. Other buildings of interest are the school with its park. The school is no longer in use, and is now transformed into a hostel. There is also a small village bakery with an old fashioned stone oven that is still used by the village people to bake the traditional flat bread.

Following on from her extensive tour to promote 1976's Smile, which resulted in the 1977 live album Season of Lights, Nyro retreated to her new home in Danbury, Connecticut, where she lived after spending her time in the spotlight in New York City. Nyro had a studio built at her home, and recorded the songs that comprised Nested there. The songs deal with themes such as motherhood and womanhood, and it is a notably more relaxed Nyro that sings on the album. The instrumentation is laidback and smooth, similar to that of Smile, but perhaps less jazz-inspired and more melodic. Nyro was assisted in production by Roscoe Harring, while Dale and Pop Ashby were chief engineers. Critics praised the album as a melodic return to form, and Nyro supported the album with a solo tour when she was heavily pregnant with her son Gil, who was born two months after the album was released. Despite acclaim and a melodic, arguably more commercial sound, Nested was not a commercial success and became Nyro's first album since her 1967 debut More Than a New Discovery to miss the Billboard 200, then known as the Pop Albums chart. Such was its commercial failure that for years it remained out of print, and is unquestionably Nyro's least-known and most rare studio album. After the birth of her son in August 1978, she retreated once again from the limelight after a three-year return to raise her son. She would not record for another five years, and her recording pattern became increasingly intermittent. Nested is recognised as one of her most underrated works. Nested was briefly released on CD in Japan only and was out of print for many years. On April 8, 2008, it was reissued on CD in the US in remastered form by Iconoclassic Records. Guitars were played by Vinnie Cusano, who later became the Guitarist for KISS from 1982 to 1984 under the name Vinnie Vincent. Overview Nested is the first of two \\"maternal\\" Laura Nyro albums, and she appears to revel in her new domesticity. Her marriage had broken down, but she had found love again and the sound is notably more relaxed than before. Felix Cavaliere returns to play piano and organ on some songs, while Nyro produces with Roscoe Harring. The origins of Nyro's political and social explorations in her lyrics of the 1980s and '90s can be traced back to Nested.

Population: History=14th century= The town was first documented in 1384, when the Novgorodians under Patrikas built there a fortress against the Swedes. It was called Yama or Yamsky Gorodok, after the Izhorian (ethnic Finnic group) name Jaama.‚òÉ‚òÉ The environs of the town are still cited as the main location of speakers of the nearly extinct Izhorian language. The citadel withstood sieges by the Swedes in 1395 and by the Teutonic Knights during the 1444‚Äì1448 war. =15-16th century= The town became the most important economic center of the Vodskaya pyatina of the Novgorod Republic. There were 201 homesteads in the 15th century in the town; its total population can only be evaluated roughly based on the estimates of three to five persons per homestead. At the end of the Livonian War, it was ceded to Sweden, only to be returned twelve years later, in 1595. =17th century= Swedish Jama in the 17th century Following the Treaty of Stolbovo, it again passed to the Swedes, who kept the name which in Swedish orthography became Jama or Jamo. The town was completely destroyed by Russian armies during the war of 1656‚Äì1658, after which only the citadel remained intact. The Swedes demolished the citadel in 1681. It is questionable whether the town, with its exclusively Russian population, ever recovered. =18th century= First held by the Russians for a month in late 1700, what was left of the citadel was finally taken by the Russians in the course of the Great Northern War in 1703. On May 14, 1703, Yam was renamed Yamburg (a German version of the name). Five years later, Peter the Great granted the town to Alexander Menshikov in his capacity of the Duke of Izhora. In the course of the administrative reform, Yamburg was included into Ingermanland Governorate (known since 1710 as Saint Petersburg Governorate). In 1780, Catherine the Great re-approved with some changes a previously existing coat of arms. Uyezd town status was granted to it in 1784. =20th century=Russian Civil War Yamburg Bridge, destroyed by the White Army, 1919 Vladimir Lenin reportedly stayed in Yamburg in January 1919, when he ordered the Bolshevik troops to retake the town of Narva from Estonian forces. In October 1919, the anti-Bolshevist commander, General Nikolai Yudenich captured Yamburg, which marked the beginning of the push by the Northwestern White Army towards Petrograd. However, the Bolsheviks subsequently re-captured Yamburg on November 14, 1919. On November 16, 1919, the forces of General Yudenich were \\"crowded together in a small space near Yamburg\\" \\"in a serious state of disorganization\\", reported The New York Times. The German form of the town name was retained until 1922, when the Bolsheviks renamed it in honor of the Estonian Communist leader Viktor Kingissepp. Kingisepp‚ÄìGdov Offensive During World War II, Kingisepp was occupied by German troops from August 16, 1941 until February 1, 1944, when the 109th Rifle Corps captured the town, forcing the German 18th Army into new positions on the eastern bank of Narva. Administrative changes In the beginning of the 20th century, Yamburg was the seat of Yamburgsky Uyezd of St. Petersburg Governorate (later known as Petrograd and Leningrad Governorate). On May 17, 1922, Yamburgsky Uyezd was renamed Kingiseppsky, simultaneously with the town. On August 1, 1927, the uyezds were abolished and Kingiseppsky District, with the administrative center in Kingisepp, was established. The governorates were also abolished, and the district became a part of Leningrad Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. On July 23, 1930, the okrugs were abolished as well and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. Between March 22, 1935 and September 19, 1940, Kingisepp was the administrative center of Kingisepp Okrug of Leningrad Oblast, one of the okrugs abutting the state boundaries of the Soviet Union. After Kingisepp Okrug was abolished on September 19, 1940, Kingisepp became a town of oblast significance on December 17, 1940. In 2010, the administrative structure of Leningrad Oblast was harmonized with the municipal structure and Kingisepp became a town of district significance. Administrative and municipal divisions Within the framework of administrative divisions, Kingisepp serves as the administrative center of Kingiseppsky District.Oblast Law #32-oz As an administrative division, it is, together with the village of Porkhovo, incorporated within Kingiseppsky District as Kingiseppskoye Settlement Municipal Formation. As a municipal division, Kingiseppskoye Settlement Municipal Formation is incorporated within Kingiseppsky Municipal District as Kingiseppskoye Urban Settlement.Law #81-oz Economy=Industry= The economy of Kingisepp is based on chemical, glass, and food industries. It is the location for the EuroChem Northwest ammonia plant which has the largest single-train production capacity in Europe, at 1 million tpy. =Transportation= Kingisepp train station The railway connecting St. Petersburg with Tallinn passes through Kingisepp and has a railway station in it. There is infrequent suburban service to the Baltiysky railway station in St. Petersburg and to Ivangorod. The A180 Highway, connecting St. Petersburg and Ivangorod, passes Kingisepp as well. It coincides with the European route E20 connecting St. Petersburg via Tallinn. Kingisepp is also connected by road with Volosovo and Slantsy. Culture Antonio Rinaldi Kingisepp contains thirteen cultural heritage monuments of federal significance and additionally seventeen objects classified as cultural and historical heritage of local significance. The federal monuments include the Yam Fortress, the St. Catherine Cathedral (by Antonio Rinaldi), and the complex of military barracks of the 19th century. Kingisepp has a local history museum. It was open in 1960 and is located in the buildings of the St. Catherine Cathedral. In 1990, the cathedral was transferred to Russian Orthodox Church and the museum was closed until 1999, when it re-opened in the former building of the commercial school, an architecture monument.

Diwan of Travancore  Bhaktivilas, the residence of Sir C. P. Ramaswami Iyer while serving as the Diwan of Travancore In 1931, when Chithira Thirunal was barred from succeeding his deceased uncle as the Maharaja of Travancore, C. P. spoke on his behalf to the Viceroy of India.Sir C. P. Remembered, p. 83 The Viceroy agreed to crown Chithira Thirunal but only on the condition that C. P. should function as adviser to the young monarch.Sir C. P. Remembered, p. 84 C. P. agreed and served as Legal and Constitutional adviser to the prince from 1931 to 1936. In 1936, Maharajah Chithira Thirunal personally requested C. P. to be the Diwan of Travancore. C. P. accepted the offer and served as Diwan for a period of ten years.Sir C. P. Remembered, p. 85 = Temple Entry Proclamation = On 12 November 1936, Maharajah Chithira Thirunal issued the revolutionary Temple Entry Proclamation which gave Hindus of all castes and classes, including Dalits or untouchables, the right to enter Hindu temples in the state.Sir C. P. Remembered, p. 77 This was bitterly opposed by conservative, yet influential upper-caste Hindus who posed a grave- threat to the life of the Diwan.Sir C. P. Remembered, p. 80 This proclamation earned for the Maharajah and his Diwan the praise of Mahatma Gandhi and other social reformers. = Economic and industrial reforms = During C. P.'s tenure as Diwan, Travancore made rapid strides in industrial development. The Indian Aluminium Company was invited to set up a factory in the town of Aluva.Sir C. P. Remembered, p. 94 The first fertiliser plant in India, the Fertilizers and Chemicals of Travancore Ltd. (FACT) was established by C. P. to manufacture ammonium sulphate.Sir C. P. Remembered, p. 97‚Äì99 This was established with American collaboration in open defiance to the hostility of the Viceroy of India. C.P. also established a plant to manufacture cement and another to manufacture titanium dioxide. The Travancore plywood factory at PunalurSir C. P. Remembered, p. 95 The Travancore Rayons Limited was established in 1946 with a plant at Perumbavoor. The first plant to manufacture aluminium cables was opened at Kundara. By the time, C. P. stepped down as Diwan in 1947, the revenues of the state had increased fourfold from the time he had assumed charge. = Irrigation works = C. P. wished to establish a hydro-electric power project on the Periyar river. However, his efforts were opposed by the Government of Madras. C. P. argued as a lawyer on behalf of Travancore and won. As a result, the Pallivasal hydro-electric power project was established on the Periyar river. He initiated the Pechipara Hydro-electric Scheme (present Kodayar Hydroelectric Power Project in Kanyakumari District), the Periyar Game Sanctuary and other irrigation projects. = Other reforms = C. P. carried out a great deal of pioneering work for the Vivekananda Rock at Cape Comorin and built guest-houses at Kanyakumari. He renovated the Padmanabhapuram Palace of Marthanda Varma's days (in present-day Kanyakumari District) and expanded the Trivandrum Art Gallery. In 1937, C. P. started the University of Travancore with the Maharajah as Chancellor and himself as Vice Chancellor. In 1939 he was awarded an honorary L.L.D. Degree by the University of Travancore In 1940 under his Dewanship Travancore became the first state to nationalise road transport in India. The first cement highway in India was constructed between the capital Trivandrum and Kanniyakumari covering a distance of 88 kilometres. The same year capital punishment was abolished and adult franchise introduced. He was also the first to appoint a lady as District Judge (Mrs. Anna Chandy later became the first Indian woman High Court Judge). Iyer introduced for the first time the midday meal scheme to prompt poor children to attend school. In 1941 the British conferred on him the title of Knight Commander of the Star of India (KCSI). When Indian Independence came into view Travancore and other Princely States were given two options of either staying independent or merging with the dominions of India or Pakistan. = Punnapra-Vayalar revolt = A mass uprising broke out in the Alleppey region in October 1946. On 24 October Travancore police killed near about 200 people in Punnapra and the government ordered martial law in Alleppey and Cherthala. CP's police and army moved to Alleppy and on 27 October, Vayalar witnessed another mass uprising and 150 people were killed on the spot. On the same day 130 people were killed in different locations of Alleppey in police shoot-outs. According to Prof. A Shreedhara Menon's Kerala History, about 1,000 people died in the Punnapra Vayalar Agitation. Even though the agitation was a short-lived failure, it resulted in better administration of Travancore. = Declaration of independence = When, on 3 June 1947, United Kingdom accepted demands for a partition and announced its intention to quit India within a short period, the Maharaja of Travancore desired to declare himself independent.Dominique Lapierre, p. 260Dominique Lapierre, p. 261 Supported by the Diwan, C. P., Chithira Thirunal issued a declaration of independence on 18 June 1947. As Travancore's declaration of independence was unacceptable to India, negotiations were started with the Diwan by the Government of India.Sir C. P. Remembered, p. 111 Family sources indicate that C. P. himself was not in favour of independence but only greater autonomy, and that a favourable agreement had been reached between C. P. and the Indian representatives by 23 July 1947 but accession to the Indian Union could not be carried out only because it was pending approval by the Raja.Sir C. P. Remembered, p. 112Sir C. P. Remembered, p. 113 On the other hand, noted historian Ramachandra Guha has written about how C. P., egged on by Mohammed Ali Jinnah, had established secret ties with senior Ministers of the British Government, who encouraged him in the hope that he would give them privileged access to monazite, a material Travancore was rich in and which could give the British a lead in the nuclear arms race. Nevertheless, an assassination attempt was made on C. P. on 25 July 1947 during a concert commemorating the anniversary of Swati Thirunal. C. P. survived with multiple stab wounds and hastened the accession of Travancore state to the Indian Union soon after his recovery.  Later years  After he resigned his Dewanship of Travancore, C. P. left for London. In the same year, he visited Brazil on the invitation of the Government of Brazil and Argentina, Peru and Mexico as a tourist.Sir C. P. Remembered, p. 137 He also visited the United States of America where he gave talks at the University of California, Berkeley, and had discussions with important bank executives, journalists and US President Harry S. Truman. In 1949‚Äì50, he visited the United States again as a Visiting Professor of the American Academy of Asian Studies at California. In 1952, he toured Australia and New Zealand as a guest of the respective governments and visited the United States again in 1953 on a lecture tour.Sir C. P. Remembered, p. 138 From 1 July 1954 to 2 July 1956, he served as the Vice Chancellor of Banaras Hindu University. From 26 January 1955, C. P. also served as a Vice Chancellor of Annamalai University, thereby becoming the first Indian to function as Vice Chancellor of two universities at the same time.Sir C. P. Remembered, p. 139 In 1953, C.P. was appointed member of the Press Commission of India.Sir C. P. Remembered, p. 143 Two years later, C. P. toured China as the leader of an Indian universities delegation. C. P. served as a member of the University Grants Commission (1955),Sir C. P.

Death  In September 1966, C. P. left for England to conduct research on a planned book titled \\"A History of My Times\\" at the India Office library.Sir C. P. Remembered, p. 147 At about 11:30 am, on 26 September 1966, he was in the National Liberal Club (where he had been a member for over 50 years), when he suddenly slumped on his armchair while speaking to a reporter and died instantly.Sir C. P. Remembered, p. 3Sir C. P. Remembered, p. 4 The following day, The Times carried the news of his death: Condolences were also offered by C. Rajagopalachari, Zakir Hussain, the then President of India, The Hindu, The Times of India, Prime Minister of India Indira GandhiSir C. P. Remembered, p. 208 and K. Kamaraj.Sir C. P. Remembered, p. 210  Legacy  C. P. was acknowledged for his talent as a lawyer, administrator and visionary. Edwin Samuel Montagu, who served as the Secretary of State for India from 1917 to 1922, described him as \\"one of the cleverest men in India\\". He is credited with having transformed Kanyakumari district into the rice-bowl of Travancore and is acclaimed for being the first person to envisage the industrialization of Madras Presidency. He is also regarded as an egalitarian and the first caste Hindu lawyer to admit a Dalit, N. Sivaraj as his junior.Sir C. P. Remembered, p. 74 Under his leadership, Travancore became the first princely state to abolish capital punishment, first to introduce free and compulsory education and the first princely state to be connected to the rest of India by air.Sir C. P. Remembered, p. 90 M. G. Ramachandran, former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu recollected at C. P.'s birth centenary celebrations in 1979 that C. P. was the first to introduce the midday meal scheme in the form of the Vanchi Poor Fund in Travancore.Sir C. P. Remembered, p. 91 C. N. Annadurai remarked at a speech in 1967 that C. P. was the first person in India to suggest a plan for interlinking the nation's rivers.Sir C. P. Remembered, p. 67 However, his greatest achievement is believed to be the Temple Entry Proclamation which for the first time, permitted Dalits to enter Hindu temples which he introduced despite a severe threat to his life. C. P. was also well known for his philanthropic activities and the institutions he helped establish. After his death, The C. P. Ramaswami Aiyar Foundation was established in his memory in order to promote traditional arts and crafts. While serving as a law member of the executive council of the Governor of Madras, Ramaswami Iyer's agenda for social reform and opening the doors of Hindu temples for Dalits and low-caste Hindus were praised by C. Natesa Mudaliar, one of the founders of the South Indian Liberation Federation.South Indian Celebrities, p. 51 C. P. was a patron of arts and music and was member of experts committee consisting of some of the leading musicians and scholars to advise the Madras Music Academy. C. P. was a friend of the English writer Somerset Maugham who had a prolonged discussion with while on a visit to Trivandrum.Sir C. P. Remembered, p. 163 Later, Maugham supplied a eulogy for the book \\"C. P. by his contemporaries\\". Indian civil servant C. S. Venkatachar wrote that the Kashmir issue might have been resolved in favour of India had Jawaharlal Nehru chosen C. P. instead of Gopalaswami Ayyangar to present India's case at the United Nations. The same view was also shared by Arcot Ramasamy Mudaliar.Sir C. P. Remembered, p. 46 While chairing the Indian Committee on National Integration, C. P. introduced the clause making it mandatory that newly elected member of Parliament and state assemblies should take an allegiance to the Indian Union. It is believed that the introduction of this clause compelled the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam to give up its goal of secession from the Indian Union. C. P. was an active freemason and served as a member of the Carnatic Lodge.  Criticism  Sir CP Ramaswami Iyer with Directors of Travancore National and quilon bank which includes C.P. Matthen (MD), K. C. Mammen Mappillai, M. O. Thomas Vakkel Modisseril(Director) While being hailed as a modernising reformer by many, C. P. is also criticised as a capitalist, authoritarian, imperialist, anti- Christian and anti-Communist by some. C. P. has been sharply criticized for failing to rescue the deteriorating Travancore National and Quilon Bank and for cracking down on the bank and its managing director, C. P. Mathen. It is believed that C.P., allegedly an anti-Christian framed the downfall of Quilon Bank, using his influence. In 1946, Communist dissent over C. P.'s policies erupted in the form of the Punnapra-Vayalar revolt which was crushed with a brutal hand by Travancore army and navy. Communist hatred over C. P.'s policies finally culminated in an assassination attempt upon the Diwan. However, despite deep antagonism between C. P. and Communists, he opposed the dismissal of the Communist government of Kerala headed by E. M. S. Namboodiripad in 1959 by the Jawaharlal Nehru government as \\"unconstitutional\\".Sir C. P. Remembered, p. 44 C. P. was also labelled as a \\"secessionist\\" due to his initial reluctance in merging Travancore with the Indian Union. Jawaharlal Nehru said of his attitude towards imperialism: His attempt to negotiate a trade agreement with Pakistan on behalf of Travancore was viewed as a betrayal by most Indians.  Family  In 1895, at the age of 16, C. P. was married to nine-year-old Seethamma (1886‚Äì1930), granddaughter of Indian polyglot and judge C. V. Runganada Sastri.Sir C. P.

Remembered, p. 181 Pattabhiraman participated in the Indian Independence Movement and was active in the Indian National Congress even after C. P.'s resignation from the party. He was elected to the Lok Sabha from Kumbakonam in 1957 and 1962 and served as Deputy Minister and later, Minister of Industries from 1966 to 1967.Sir C. P. Remembered, p. 182 Pattabhiraman was also one of the founders of the Madras Cricket Club along with P. Subbarayan.

Their traditional occupation was that of weaving and they are found mostly in the regions of northern Kerala, southern coastal Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. Caste names The oldest names for weavers in Kannada and Telugu regions were Saliga (or its variants, Sale, Sali, Saliya etc.) or Jeda (or its variants Jada, Jandra etc.). However, the present day names like Devanga and Padmasali are the results of Sanskritisation with myths of origins. The original names simply meant weaver (spider). While Saliga is tadbhava of jalikha, spider or weaver in Sanskrit, Jeda is a Kannada word for spider. According to Ramaswamy, as part of the Virasaiva movement weavers initially championed caste negation or anti-casteism initially. However, as time passed even that movement became caste-ridden and various communities started claiming ritual superiority vis-a-vis other communities part of the same religion and also against non-Virasaiva communities like Brahmins. As caste negation gave way to caste exaltation even weavers tried to obtain higher caste credentials and privileges. In 1231, at Chintamani (in the present day Karnataka region with a mixed Kannada/Telugu population) it is said (a dubious claim according to Vijaya Ramaswamy) that a king granted privileges like right to the yajnopavita (the sacred thread worn by Brahmins), right to ride a palanquin, right to one's own flag and symbol etc... to Devanga weavers. Many of these privileges were later granted to Padmashali weavers too. =Edanga and Valanga= According to Ramaswamy, Sali and Devanga weavers were always part of right hand castes while Kaikkola Sengunthar were part of left hand castes. Relationship to other Malayali castes In Kannur, Ashtamachal Bhagavathy temple part of Payyannur Teru has a unique tradition of a festival called Meenamrithu which is related to sea trading culture of the past. It was believed to have belonged to a merchant community called Valanjiyar belonging to left-hand caste group in the past. However, now Saliyas conduct this ritual. But relationship between Valanjiyar and Saliya communities at present is still a speculation.Meenamruthu Festival See also *Nesa Nayanar References and notesAdditional references * Caste and Race in India by G.S.

The album was released at the beginning of 1984 after a year of difficult and expensive recording sessions, and came more than five years after its predecessor, 1978's well-received but poor-selling Nested. Thanks to a small buzz surrounding Nyro's return to the spotlight after her second period of semi-retirement (the first came from 1972-1975), Mother's Spiritual became Nyro's last US chart entry, reaching #182 on the Billboard 200 chart. Musically, Mother's Spiritual is the most serene and easygoing of all Laura Nyro albums, and was criticised in some quarters for being too sedate and maternal in comparison to her wild, adventurous, and experimental albums such as Eli and the Thirteenth Confession and New York Tendaberry. Thematically, Nyro's concerns turned from passion and love towards subjects of a more political and sociological nature, including environmentalism, motherhood, and feminism. It met with mixed reviews, and Nyro was lambasted in some quarters for \\"turning into a tree-hugger.\\" After being out of print in the U.S. for many years, Mother's Spiritual was finally released on CD in 2009. It was her last studio album for nine years, and she returned only in 1988 to stage a tour. The album represents Nyro's sole original output of the 1980s, during which time she concentrated mostly on raising her son Gil, born in 1978. Background The recording of Mother's Spiritual was punctuated by several difficult incidences. Nyro intended to record the album, as with predecessor Nested, at her Danbury home and laid down solo demos of the songs as early as the spring of 1982. Then, Nyro spent 3 to 4 days a week over eight weeks recording at The Boogie Hotel on Long Island, NY, with recording engineer and studio owner Jeffrey Kawalek at the board, and producer Joe Wissert commuting from California for the sessions - but Nyro was not satisfied with the outcome of the music. So she then spent between $150,000 and $200,000 building a proper studio at her home (as opposed to the mobile studio where Nested was recorded) and continued recording with Roscoe Harring as co-producer. The album's arrangements are soft and wistful, but Nyro also desired a more fiery edge to the songs as well. Longtime fan Todd Rundgren, however, was not particularly encouraging about Nyro's new sound and soon aborted his role as producer having cited her indecisive and languid approach as factors.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APZN_uL-z0A Although there is some quite upbeat material (\\"Sophia\\", \\"Talk to a Green Tree\\", \\"The Brighter Song\\"), Mother's Spiritual is dominated by slow piano- driven songs. These were seen by some critics as close to New Age music. Nyro would perform them live in concert for the rest of her career.

He was the longest serving governor, holding the office for 18 years. Early life Gabriel Johnston was born in Scotland in 1699. He was a physician, political writer, and professor of Oriental languages at the University of St. Andrews. Governor of North Carolina Johnston was greatly disturbed by the conditions he found in the province and deplored what he considered the moral laxity, the disregard for law, the inadequate educational facilities, and the oppression of the poor. His administration witnessed an increase in wealth, population, and development of resources. The United Brethren purchased 100,000 acres of land and settled Wachovia. Another group emigrating in large numbers, and with especial appeal for the governor, were the Scots, who settled in the Cape Fear region. The union with England and a breakup in the clan system, as well as a pardon to all Scottish rebels who would emigrate, greatly stimulated their settlement in America. The General Assembly of North Carolina exempted all new settlers from taxation for ten years. The general assembly was probably motivated by a desire to increase immigration to the province, but doubtless the Scottish governor added weight to the measure. Legacy Some years later the General Assembly of North Carolina provided for the erection of a fort on the south bank of Cape Fear and named it in honor of Johnston. Johnston County was also named after him.

The siblings were in the 13th generation, he said, of the Ayers family that had settled in Newbury, Massachusetts in 1635. At 18, during World War II, he enlisted in the United States Army Air Corps, and was stationed in Florida, where after failing radar training he was sent for a month's art training at McTomb University and began working as an artist in the Air Corps' Operations division. He published his first comic strip, Radio Ray, in the military newspaper Radio Post in 1942. Career Ayers broke into comics with unpublished work done for Western Publishing's Dell Comics imprint. \\"I approached them,\\" Ayers said in a 1996 interview. \\"I had a story written and drawn. They wanted to wrap a book around it.... I got into it, but Dell decided to scrap the project. ... It was an adventure thing, boy and girl; the boy wanted to be a trumpet player.

He drew horror stories in such titles as Adventures into Terror, Astonishing, Journey into Mystery, Journey into Unknown Worlds, Menace, Mystery Tales, Mystic, Strange Tales, and Uncanny Tales. As well, he drew the brief revival of the 1940s Golden Age of Comics superhero the Human Torch, from Marvel's 1940s predecessor Timely Comics, in Young Men # 21-24 (June 1953 - Feb. 1954). An additional, unpublished Human Torch story drawn by Ayers belatedly appeared in Marvel Super-Heroes #16 (Sept. 1968).

Cover art by Ayers Ayers first teamed with the highly influential and historically important penciler Jack Kirby at Atlas shortly before Atlas transitioned to become Marvel Comics. As Kirby's second regular Marvel inker, following Christopher Rule, Ayers would ink countless covers and stories, including on such landmark comics as most early issues of The Fantastic Four, in addition to a slew of Western and \\"pre-superhero Marvel\\" monster stories in Amazing Adventures, Journey into Mystery, Strange Tales, Tales of Suspense, and Tales to Astonish. Because creator credits were not routinely given at the time, two standard databases disagree over the duo's first published collaboration.The Grand Comics Database cites the cover of Wyatt Earp #24 (Aug. 1959), which AtlasTales.com lists as inked by George Klein. Grand Comics Database tentatively lists Ayers as inker of the Kirby cover for that same month's Strange Tales #70, for which Atlas Tales credits Ayers without qualification. Ayers revealed in 1996, however: Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos #57 (Aug. 1968). Cover art by penciler Ayers and inker John Severin.

Collins Crime Club - A checklist of First Editions. Dragonby Press (Second Edition) March 1999 (Page 15) The US Edition retailed at $2.00 and the UK edition at seven shillings and sixpence (7/6). It is the only one of Christie's novels not to be set in the 20th century, and - unusually for her - also features no European characters. Instead, the novel is set in Thebes in 2000 BC, a setting for which Christie gained an appreciation whilst working with her archaeologist husband, Sir Max Mallowan, in the Middle East. The novel is notable for its very high number of deaths and is comparable to And Then There Were None from this standpoint. It is also the first full-length novel combining historical fiction and the whodunit/detective story, a genre which would later come to be called the historical whodunit. The suggestion to base the story in ancient Egypt came from noted Egyptologist and family friend Stephen Glanville. He also assisted Christie with details of daily household life in Egypt 4000 years ago. In addition he made forceful suggestions to Christie to change the ending of the book. This she did but regretted the fact afterwards, feeling that her (unpublished) ending was better. The novel is based on real letters translated by egyptologist Battiscombe Gunn, from the Egyptian Middle Kingdom period, written by a man called Heqanakhte to his family, complaining about their behaviour and treatment of his concubine.BBC: Voices from Ancient Egypt Gallery It is one of only four Christie novels to have not received an adaptation of any kind, the others being Destination Unknown, Passenger to Frankfurt and Postern of Fate. A BBC television adaptation for broadcast in 2021 has been announced.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7620682/episodes?season=1 Christie uses a theme for her chapter titles, as she did for many of her novels, in this case the Egyptian agricultural calendar. Plot introduction The quiet lives of an Egyptian family are disturbed when the father, Imhotep, returns from the north with his new concubine, Nofret, who begins to sow discontent amongst them. Once the deaths begin, fears are aroused of a curse upon the house, but is the killer closer to home? Plot summary The novel is primarily written from the perspective of Renisenb, a young widow reacquainting herself with her family when her father Imhotep, a successful but pompous and short-sighted mortuary priest, brings a new \\"wife\\", Nofret, into their lives. Nofret soon disrupts and antagonises Imhotep's sons - Yahmose, Sobek and Ipy - as well as their wives. Renisenb realises the housekeeper Henet, while feigning devotion, is full of hatred. She eventually confronts Henet, who in a fit of pique admits she hates Renisenb and hated Renisenb's long-deceased mother. After Imhotep is called away, Satipy and Kait, the elder sons' wives, try to bully Nofret with tricks, but the plan backfires when Nofret appeals to Imhotep and he threatens to disown his sons and their families upon his return. Suddenly everyone has a motive to kill Nofret and when she is found dead at the foot of a cliff, an accident seems unlikely, although no one will acknowledge anything else. Next, Satipy falls to her death in terror from the same cliff while walking with Yahmose. Was it Nofret's vengeful spirit that she was looking at over Yahmose's shoulder moments before her death? The rumours only gather pace when Yahmose and Sobek drink poisoned wine. Sobek dies, but Yahmose lingers on, having drunk less of the wine. A slave boy who says he saw Nofret's ghost poisoning the wine dies of poison shortly afterwards. The handsome scribe Kameni has fallen in love with Renisenb, and eventually asks her to marry him. Unsure whether she loves him or her father's advisor Hori, whom she has known since she was a child, she leaves the choice effectively in her father's hands and becomes engaged to Kameni. She realises, however, that his relationship with Nofret was closer than she had supposed, and that jealousy may have influenced Nofret's bitter hatred towards the family. Hori and Esa, the elderly mother of Imhotep (a clever woman who although almost completely blind sees things clearer than most others - especially her son) begin to investigate the possibility of a human murderer. Ipy, himself a likely suspect, starts to boast about his new, better position with his father; he plots to get rid of housekeeper Henet and tells her so. The next morning, Ipy is found dead in the lake, drowned. The field of suspects has been further narrowed. Esa attempts to flush out the murderer by dropping a hint about the death of Satipy, but is herself murdered by means of poisoned unguent, despite the presence of a food taster. Henet - who knows the murderer's identity and is momentarily powerful amid the chaos - is smothered by the linens used to wrap the ever-increasing number of victims. On the same cliff path where Nofret and Satipy died, Renisenb, apparently summoned by Hori, hears footsteps behind her and turns to see Yahmose. She then sees the look of murderous hatred in her brother's eyes that the other women saw before they were killed. On the brink of her own death, she realises that Satipy was not looking in fear at anything beyond Yahmose ‚Äî she was looking straight at him. He had consumed a non-lethal dose of poison and pretended to recuperate while committing murders, both to make himself chief heir and to indulge his newfound love of violence. As Renisenb realises some of this, Hori slays Yahmose with an arrow and saves her. Hori explains all. Renisenb's final choice is whom to marry: Kameni, a lively husband not unlike her first, or Hori, an older and more enigmatic figure. She makes her choice and falls into Hori's arms.

The scenes of Death Comes as the End are laid out in Ancient Egypt. They are painted delicately. The household of the priest, who is depicted not as a sacred personage, but as a humdrum landowner, makes an instant appeal because its members are human. But while the author's skill can cause a stir over the death of an old woman some thousands of years ago, that length of time lessens curiosity concerning why or how she (and others) died.\\"The Times Literary Supplement, 28 April 1945 (p. 202) Maurice Richardson, a self-proclaimed admirer of Christie, wrote in the 8 April 1945 issue of The Observer, \\"One of the best weeks of the war for crime fiction. First, of course, the new Agatha Christie; Death Comes as the End. And it really is startlingly new, with its ancient Egyptian setting in the country household of a mortuary priest who overstrains his already tense family by bringing home an ultra-tough live in concubine from Memphis. Result: a series of murders. With her special archaeological equipment, Mrs Christie makes you feel just as much at home on the Nile in 1945 B.C. as if she were bombarding you with false clues in a chintz-covered drawing room in Leamington Spa. But she has not merely changed scenes; her reconstruction is vivid and she works really hard at her characters. My already insensate admiration for her leaps even higher.\\"The Observer, 8 April 1945 (Page 3) In 1990 the novel was included in Crime Writers' Associations' The Top 100 Crime Novels of All Time list. Robert Barnard: \\"Hercule Poirot's Christmas, transported to Egypt, ca 2000 B.C.

Knowledge of the preferred orientation in turn may be used to predict the strength of association or binding affinity between two molecules using, for example, scoring functions. Schematic illustration of docking a small molecule ligand (green) to a protein target (black) producing a stable complex. Docking of a small molecule (green) into the crystal structure of the beta-2 adrenergic G-protein coupled receptor () The associations between biologically relevant molecules such as proteins, peptides, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and lipids play a central role in signal transduction. Furthermore, the relative orientation of the two interacting partners may affect the type of signal produced (e.g., agonism vs antagonism). Therefore, docking is useful for predicting both the strength and type of signal produced. Molecular docking is one of the most frequently used methods in structure-based drug design, due to its ability to predict the binding-conformation of small molecule ligands to the appropriate target binding site. Characterisation of the binding behaviour plays an important role in rational design of drugs as well as to elucidate fundamental biochemical processes.  Definition of problem  One can think of molecular docking as a problem of ‚Äúlock-and-key‚Äù, in which one wants to find the correct relative orientation of the ‚Äúkey‚Äù which will open up the ‚Äúlock‚Äù (where on the surface of the lock is the key hole, which direction to turn the key after it is inserted, etc.). Here, the protein can be thought of as the ‚Äúlock‚Äù and the ligand can be thought of as a ‚Äúkey‚Äù. Molecular docking may be defined as an optimization problem, which would describe the ‚Äúbest-fit‚Äù orientation of a ligand that binds to a particular protein of interest. However, since both the ligand and the protein are flexible, a ‚Äúhand-in-glove‚Äù analogy is more appropriate than ‚Äúlock-and-key‚Äù. During the course of the docking process, the ligand and the protein adjust their conformation to achieve an overall \\"best- fit\\" and this kind of conformational adjustment resulting in the overall binding is referred to as \\"induced-fit\\". Molecular docking research focuses on computationally simulating the molecular recognition process. It aims to achieve an optimized conformation for both the protein and ligand and relative orientation between protein and ligand such that the free energy of the overall system is minimized.  Docking approaches  Two approaches are particularly popular within the molecular docking community. One approach uses a matching technique that describes the protein and the ligand as complementary surfaces. The second approach simulates the actual docking process in which the ligand-protein pairwise interaction energies are calculated. Both approaches have significant advantages as well as some limitations. These are outlined below. = Shape complementarity = Geometric matching/ shape complementarity methods describe the protein and ligand as a set of features that make them dockable. These features may include molecular surface / complementary surface descriptors. In this case, the receptor's molecular surface is described in terms of its solvent-accessible surface area and the ligand's molecular surface is described in terms of its matching surface description. The complementarity between the two surfaces amounts to the shape matching description that may help finding the complementary pose of docking the target and the ligand molecules. Another approach is to describe the hydrophobic features of the protein using turns in the main-chain atoms. Yet another approach is to use a Fourier shape descriptor technique. Whereas the shape complementarity based approaches are typically fast and robust, they cannot usually model the movements or dynamic changes in the ligand/ protein conformations accurately, although recent developments allow these methods to investigate ligand flexibility. Shape complementarity methods can quickly scan through several thousand ligands in a matter of seconds and actually figure out whether they can bind at the protein's active site, and are usually scalable to even protein-protein interactions. They are also much more amenable to pharmacophore based approaches, since they use geometric descriptions of the ligands to find optimal binding. = Simulation = Simulating the docking process is much more complicated. In this approach, the protein and the ligand are separated by some physical distance, and the ligand finds its position into the protein's active site after a certain number of ‚Äúmoves‚Äù in its conformational space. The moves incorporate rigid body transformations such as translations and rotations, as well as internal changes to the ligand's structure including torsion angle rotations. Each of these moves in the conformation space of the ligand induces a total energetic cost of the system. Hence, the system's total energy is calculated after every move. The obvious advantage of docking simulation is that ligand flexibility is easily incorporated, whereas shape complementarity techniques must use ingenious methods to incorporate flexibility in ligands. Also, it more accurately models reality, whereas shape complementary techniques are more of an abstraction. Clearly, simulation is computationally expensive, having to explore a large energy landscape. Grid-based techniques, optimization methods, and increased computer speed have made docking simulation more realistic.  Mechanics of docking  Docking flow-chart overview To perform a docking screen, the first requirement is a structure of the protein of interest. Usually the structure has been determined using a biophysical technique such as x-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy or cryo electron microscopy (cryo- EM), but can also derive from homology modeling construction. This protein structure and a database of potential ligands serve as inputs to a docking program. The success of a docking program depends on two components: the search algorithm and the scoring function. = Search algorithm = The search space in theory consists of all possible orientations and conformations of the protein paired with the ligand. However, in practice with current computational resources, it is impossible to exhaustively explore the search space‚Äîthis would involve enumerating all possible distortions of each molecule (molecules are dynamic and exist in an ensemble of conformational states) and all possible rotational and translational orientations of the ligand relative to the protein at a given level of granularity. Most docking programs in use account for the whole conformational space of the ligand (flexible ligand), and several attempt to model a flexible protein receptor. Each \\"snapshot\\" of the pair is referred to as a pose. A variety of conformational search strategies have been applied to the ligand and to the receptor. These include: * systematic or stochastic torsional searches about rotatable bonds * molecular dynamics simulations * genetic algorithms to \\"evolve\\" new low energy conformations and where the score of each pose acts as the fitness function used to select individuals for the next iteration.  Ligand flexibility  Conformations of the ligand may be generated in the absence of the receptor and subsequently docked or conformations may be generated on-the-fly in the presence of the receptor binding cavity, or with full rotational flexibility of every dihedral angle using fragment based docking. Force field energy evaluation are most often used to select energetically reasonable conformations, but knowledge-based methods have also been used. Peptides are both highly flexible and relatively large-sized molecules, which makes modeling their flexibility a challenging task. A number of methods were developed to allow for efficient modeling of flexibility of peptides during protein-peptide docking.  Receptor flexibility  Computational capacity has increased dramatically over the last decade making possible the use of more sophisticated and computationally intensive methods in computer-assisted drug design. However, dealing with receptor flexibility in docking methodologies is still a thorny issue. The main reason behind this difficulty is the large number of degrees of freedom that have to be considered in this kind of calculations. Neglecting it, however, in some of the cases may lead to poor docking results in terms of binding pose prediction. Multiple static structures experimentally determined for the same protein in different conformations are often used to emulate receptor flexibility. Alternatively rotamer libraries of amino acid side chains that surround the binding cavity may be searched to generate alternate but energetically reasonable protein conformations. = Scoring function = Docking programs generate a large number of potential ligand poses, of which some can be immediately rejected due to clashes with the protein. The remainder are evaluated using some scoring function, which takes a pose as input and returns a number indicating the likelihood that the pose represents a favorable binding interaction and ranks one ligand relative to another. Most scoring functions are physics-based molecular mechanics force fields that estimate the energy of the pose within the binding site. The various contributions to binding can be written as an additive equation: \\\\bigtriangleup G_{bind} = \\\\bigtriangleup G_{solvent} + \\\\bigtriangleup G_{conf} + \\\\bigtriangleup G_{int} + \\\\bigtriangleup G_{rot} + \\\\bigtriangleup G_{t/t} + \\\\bigtriangleup G_{vib} The components consist of solvent effects, conformational changes in the protein and ligand, free energy due to protein-ligand interactions, internal rotations, association energy of ligand and receptor to form a single complex and free energy due to changes in vibrational modes. A low (negative) energy indicates a stable system and thus a likely binding interaction. An alternative approach is to derive a knowledge-based statistical potential for interactions from a large database of protein-ligand complexes, such as the Protein Data Bank, and evaluate the fit of the pose according to this inferred potential. There are a large number of structures from X-ray crystallography for complexes between proteins and high affinity ligands, but comparatively fewer for low affinity ligands as the later complexes tend to be less stable and therefore more difficult to crystallize. Scoring functions trained with this data can dock high affinity ligands correctly, but they will also give plausible docked conformations for ligands that do not bind. This gives a large number of false positive hits, i.e., ligands predicted to bind to the protein that actually don't when placed together in a test tube. One way to reduce the number of false positives is to recalculate the energy of the top scoring poses using (potentially) more accurate but computationally more intensive techniques such as Generalized Born or Poisson-Boltzmann methods.  Docking assessment  The interdependence between sampling and scoring function affects the docking capability in predicting plausible poses or binding affinities for novel compounds. Thus, an assessment of a docking protocol is generally required (when experimental data is available) to determine its predictive capability. Docking assessment can be performed using different strategies, such as: * docking accuracy (DA) calculation; * the correlation between a docking score and the experimental response or determination of the enrichment factor (EF); * the distance between an ion-binding moiety and the ion in the active site; * the presence of induce-fit models. = Docking accuracy = Docking accuracy represents one measure to quantify the fitness of a docking program by rationalizing the ability to predict the right pose of a ligand with respect to that experimentally observed. = Enrichment factor = Docking screens can also be evaluated by the enrichment of annotated ligands of known binders from among a large database of presumed non-binding, ‚Äúdecoy‚Äù molecules. In this way, the success of a docking screen is evaluated by its capacity to enrich the small number of known active compounds in the top ranks of a screen from among a much greater number of decoy molecules in the database. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is widely used to evaluate its performance. = Prospective = Resulting hits from docking screens are subjected to pharmacological validation (e.g. IC50, affinity or potency measurements). Only prospective studies constitute conclusive proof of the suitability of a technique for a particular target. = Benchmarking = The potential of docking programs to reproduce binding modes as determined by X-ray crystallography can be assessed by a range of docking benchmark sets. For small molecules, several benchmark data sets for docking and virtual screening exist e.g. Astex Diverse Set consisting of high quality protein‚àíligand X-ray crystal structures or the Directory of Useful Decoys (DUD) for evaluation of virtual screening performance. An evaluation of docking programs for their potential to reproduce peptide binding modes can be assessed by Lessons for Efficiency Assessment of Docking and Scoring (LEADS- PEP).  Applications  A binding interaction between a small molecule ligand and an enzyme protein may result in activation or inhibition of the enzyme. If the protein is a receptor, ligand binding may result in agonism or antagonism. Docking is most commonly used in the field of drug design ‚Äî most drugs are small organic molecules, and docking may be applied to: * hit identification ‚Äì docking combined with a scoring function can be used to quickly screen large databases of potential drugs in silico to identify molecules that are likely to bind to protein target of interest (see virtual screening). * lead optimization ‚Äì docking can be used to predict in where and in which relative orientation a ligand binds to a protein (also referred to as the binding mode or pose). This information may in turn be used to design more potent and selective analogs. * Bioremediation ‚Äì Protein ligand docking can also be used to predict pollutants that can be degraded by enzymes.

Influenced at his beginnings by Bu√±uel, Cocteau, the surrealists and by the Japanese cinema (Seijun Suzuki, Ishir≈ç Honda, K≈çji Wakamatsu, Yoko Ono), stunned by the Festival of the film exp√©rimental of Knokke in 1967 and by May 1968, Roland Lethem wants to push the people to look at the things of which they say they are freed, it's to say to place them in front of their responsibilities. Even if sometimes the results leaves much to be desired, the idea of each one of his films is seductive and exemplary. A fact is certain, his films are disturbing, they are sometimes unpleasant to look at. The narcissistic and provocative play of the debuts turned itself into direct, visual, and verbal insult, and in slandering. His dream was one moment to be able to film the intimate life of the pope or the sexual plays of the Belgian sovereigns. Through violence, pornography and cruelty of some scenes, Roland Lethem is a gentle, generous man with of a lot of humour. The work of Roland Lethem evolves, becomes political, ecological. La Ballade des amants maudits (The Ballad of the cursed lovers, 1966) or La F√©e sanguinaire (The Bloodthirsty Fairy, 1968) still tell stories. Les Souffrances d'un oeuf meurtri (The Sufferings of a ravaged Egg, 1967), poem of love in several parts (√âtoiles/Stars, Corps/Bodies, Hymen/Marriage or Hymen (ambiguous in French), Oeuf/Egg) dedicated to all who conceive and to all who are conceived, irresistibly makes you think at the Histoire de l'oeil (Story of the Eye, 1928) of Georges Bataille. Some of the titles of his films include Le Saigneur est avec nous and Le sexe enrag√©. There are several thorough studies published on his films (Cinema/London, Skoop/Amsterdam) and Bandes de cons!

The US edition retailed at $2.50 and the UK edition at eight shillings and sixpence (8/6). It features her famous Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot, and is set in 1946. The novel tells a story of post-World War II England, when life seems turned upside down, with the relief of the end of the war, the changes from who lived and who died, and the economic challenge of post-war life, playing out for one family in a village not far from London. The detective Superintendent Spence is introduced in this novel, with whom Poirot works again in a few more stories. The Cloade family, brothers and one sister, have had many abrupt changes from the war, losing their brother Gordon in a London bombing raid shortly after his unexpected marriage to a young widow. One son is lost to fighting, a daughter returns from serving as a Wren, and another son seems to be making a successful venture at farming, despite losing his partner in the venture to the war. When the Wren Lynn returns, her interrupted engagement to her cousin resumes, with troublesome interruption from the brother of Uncle Gordon's widow Rosaleen. A stranger in the village, using the literary name Enoch Arden, blackmails David Hunter and is soon found murdered. Hercule Poirot is called in. Richardson found the \\"doubly twisted\\" plot, to be \\"ingenious enough\\", but for him, \\"the quintessential zest, the sense of well- being which goes to make up that Christie feeling, is missing.\\" Another was more pleased with the novel, saying that Poirot solves the mysteries \\"with all the acumen that has endeared him to Agatha Christie fans. Fantastic and topping.\\" A review in 1990 was pleased to find a Christie novel tied distinctly to a specific year and world event, but had a more complex commentary on the novel as a whole, calling it a \\"Compulsive reworking of Tennysonian and Christiean themes, and pretty high up in the range of classic titles.\\" Plot introduction In spring 1944 during World War II, Gordon Cloade marries a widow he meets on board ship to New York, Rosaleen Underhay. A few days after arriving in London with his new wife, his London home is bombed, killing all but two people. One survivor is Gordon's brother-in-law, David Hunter, and the other is his new wife, Rosaleen Cloade. Gordon did not write a new will upon arrival, and his existing will is invalidated by the marriage. Rosaleen inherits Gordon's fortune. A day or so later, during another raid, Poirot sits in a shelter with people from the Concordia club in London and listens to a story about Major Porter's friend Robert Underhay in Africa, about his unhappy marriage and that Underhay may not be dead, told after reading out the news that Gordon Cloade, the second husband of Underhay's widow, was killed by enemy action. The death of Gordon Cloade brings unexpected change to his siblings and their families. Gordon gave them capital to start a venture, to handle unexpected expenses, encouraged them not to save, and promised his fortune would be split among them when he died. Plot summary In spring 1946, Lynn Marchmont, a Wren during the war, settles again in her mother's home in the village of Warmsley Vale in peacetime, at first happy to be home, then finding life dull. She has been engaged to farmer Rowley Cloade since before the war. David guards his sister and her fortune. Mrs Marchmont gets up the courage to ask Rosaleen for five hundred pounds when David is away, and Rosaleen writes a check. David angrily turns down a request from Frances Cloade, whose family is in desperate need of money. A man calling himself Enoch Arden arrives at the village inn The Stag, and attempts to blackmail David by saying he knows how to find Rosaleen's first husband, Robert Underhay. Their conversation is overheard by the landlady, who tells Rowley Cloade. A few days later, a maid finds Arden's body in his room with his head smashed in. That same day, David was down from London. He met Lynn on his dash to catch the last train to London, and evidently telephoned her from the London flat shortly after 11 pm, arguing first that he loves her and then that he cannot be good for her. As the murder is believed to have happened before 9 pm, he had enough opportunity and motive and he is arrested. Rowley Cloade appeals to the detective Hercule Poirot to find the true identity of the dead man. Poirot asks Major Porter. Rosaleen sees the body and says she does not know the man at all. At the inquest, Porter says that Arden was indeed Robert Underhay, and the coroner's jury votes against advice to believe him, voting willful murder by David. The estate will revert to the Cloades, if the jury's decision holds, as it means Rosaleen's second marriage was not valid. Poirot talks to people in the village, including Mrs Leadbetter, a guest at the inn who saw a hussy, a heavily made up woman wearing slacks and an orange scarf, enter the room assigned to the dead man after 10 pm on the fateful evening. As the police believe that David was on the train to London at that time, they let him go, and look more seriously at women. Poirot learns how the death occurred, with a fall on the marble fender of the fireplace. He proposes it was accidental death, not intentional murder. Lynn is falling in love with David. Major Porter commits suicide in London but leaves no note. Poirot realises from a photo at the home of Frances Cloade that Arden was related to her; she admits Arden was Charles Trenton, her second cousin. She came up with the plan to blackmail Rosaleen after hearing Major Porter's story about Underhay. This explains Arden's true identity, but nothing else. Frances denies bribing Major Porter. When Poirot and Lynn visit Rosaleen at home, the maid realizes she does not respond. Poirot sees that Rosaleen has died in her sleep. The doctor identifies the harmless sleeping powder she took, at her bedside table. Superintendent Spence, the investigating officer, suggests that she was the murderer. Rosaleen died from too much morphine; where did she get it? Lynn tells Rowley that she wishes to marry David Hunter and he explodes in anger. Rowley is strangling Lynn when Poirot enters the house, and Rowley stops. David arrives shortly, and Poirot explains everything. Rowley visited Arden, and seeing the resemblance to Frances, reacted angrily to the deception. Punched by Rowley, Arden fell against the marble fireplace fender and died. Rowley saw the opportunity to incriminate David. He smashed in Arden's head with fire tongs and left David's lighter at the scene. Rowley persuaded Porter to give the false identification by offering him money. Then Rowley employed Poirot, who would be sure to go to Porter. Porter's guilt led him to commit suicide, leaving a note that Rowley destroyed. David was about to pay the blackmail to Arden; upon discovering Arden's body, David ran for the late train but missed it. David then backtracked to The Stag, disguised himself as a woman, and played out the scene, heard by Mrs Leadbetter, which established the later time of death. Then he called Rosaleen, who placed a call to Lynn that was delivered by the operator but then cut off. A minute later, David called Lynn from the local train station, giving her the impression that he was calling from London. He returned to London on the early morning milk train the next day. Of the three deaths, Poirot says one is accidental, one is a suicide, and one is murder. The true murder victim was Rosaleen. The woman known as Rosaleen was not David Hunter's sister; his sister was killed and the housemaid Eileen Corrigan had survived the bombing. Poirot sent to Ireland for a photo of Eileen, which explained the truth of what happened during the war. David persuaded her to be Rosaleen. Now he could kill this accomplice with a morphine pill and marry Lynn, whom he loved. Poirot knows all these details but only some of them are known to the police. Rowley feels guilty about the deaths of Trenton and Porter. The police focus on David killing Rosaleen/Eileen, and proving all of that case. After a while, Lynn returns to Rowley, realizing she does love him, especially after his show of force. Life will not be dull with him.

Explanation of the novel's title The title of the book in both the UK and US markets is a line from Shakespeare's Julius Caesar in a speech by Brutus in Act IV: \\"There is a tide in the affairs of men, which taken at the flood leads on to fortune . . .\\". The quotation is given in full as the epigraph to the novel. Literary significance and reception No review of this book appeared in the Times Literary Supplement. For once, Maurice Richardson, in his review of the 21 November 1948 issue of The Observer was slightly unimpressed: \\"Agatha Christie has, if not a whole day off, at least part of the afternoon. The killing of the blackmailing Enoch Arden, who puts up at the local to harry the already embarrassed Cloade family, the murder that follows, and Poirot's doubly twisted solution are ingenious enough, but the characterisation is a little below par. The quintessential zest, the sense of well-being which goes to make up that Christie feeling, is missing.\\" An unnamed reviewer in the Toronto Daily Star of 10 April 1948 said, \\"Hercule Poirot, whose eggshaped cranium is crammed with lively gray cells, proves himself a bit of a mug before he sorts out all the details of [Enoch Arden's] death and other even more baffling mysteries. But he does it with all the acumen that has endeared him to Agatha Christie fans. Fantastic and topping.\\" Robert Barnard summarised the plot of the novel as an \\"Elderly man married to a glamorous nitwit of dubious social background [which] is a common plot-element in Christie. Here she is widowed (in an air- raid ‚Äì this is one of the few Christies anchored to an actual time), and burdened by financially insatiable relatives, both of blood and in-law. But who exactly is dead, and who isn't? And who is what they seem, and who isn't?\\" His commentary is favorable on the title, more cryptic on the novel itself, as he said it was a \\"Compulsive reworking of Tennysonian and Christiean themes, and pretty high up in the range of classic titles.\\" References to other works The false alibi used by the murderer of a witness sighting the missed train smoke was a partial re-use of a plot device used by Christie in the 1925 short story The Sign in the Sky, later published in the 1930 collection The Mysterious Mr. Quin.

The cast included Elliot Cowan as David Hunter, Eva Birthistle as Rosaleen, Celia Imrie as Kathy Cloade, Jenny Agutter as Adela Marchmont and Tim Pigott-Smith as Dr. Lionel Woodward. The film made several significant changes to the plot: * Like almost all episodes of the TV series, the adaptation shifts the setting to the late 1930s. * David's motive is modified in the adaptation, upgrading him from a simple murderer, to that of a mass murderer. In the adaptation, the deaths of Gordon Cloade, Rosaleen Turner, and the entire Cloade estate that is present with them, are assumed to be the result of an apparent gas explosion, but Poirot later investigates this, and reveals in his denouement that the explosion was caused by dynamite that David had planted in the house, who sought revenge against his sister for marrying Gordon and excluding her brother as her \\"first love\\". Whereas in the novel, there is no mentioning of incest. He and his accomplice, Eileen Corrigan, who were present in the house at the time, took shelter in the basement once the explosives had been planted, and then emerged from the ruins afterwards. * Eileen's involvement is significantly changed - She is an Irish Catholic in the adaptation, who was raped and impregnated by David, and then forced into an induced abortion. This breaks her and forces her to submit to David's will under the promise of heaven if she obeys his commands, or eternal damnation in \\"the fires of hell\\" if she refuses. Unlike the novel, she is saved from dying of a morphine overdose, thanks to Dr. Woodward's addiction to the drug leading him to steal some, with Poirot proving that David had set it up so that she would be an addict herself out of guilt, and try to kill herself as a result of her own guilty actions. * Kathy repeatedly harasses Eileen with anonymous phone calls, in which she calls her \\"whore\\", \\"slut\\", \\"bitch\\" and \\"bigamist\\", an event that does not occur in the novel. In addition, she becomes Adela's sister: Lionel is no longer a member of the Cloade family, despite a mistake in the adaptation's credits that refer him to be so; he is instead renamed as Lionel Woodward, and introduced as such by Kathy when she visits Poirot at the beginning of the adaptation. * After David is denounced for his crimes in the Stag Inn, he threatens to blow it all up with everyone inside it, but reveals this to be nothing more than a cruel joke as there is no dynamite inside, after being talked into sparing everyone by Lynn; the event which does not occur in the novel. * Lynn does not marry Rowley towards the end. Instead, after David is hanged, she leaves England to head for Africa, stating in a letter to Poirot that despite everything, she is still in love with him. This story was adapted for television in the episode Le flux et le reflux [The Ebb and the Flow] in the French series Les Petits Meurtres d'Agatha Christie, the eighth episode in the first series, first airing 15 April 2011. Antoine Dul√©ry was Superintendent Larosi√®re, and Marius Colucci was his assistant, Lampion. The adaptation was written by Anne Giafferi and Murielle Magellan, and directed by Sylvie Simon. The plot is essentially the same, but set in a chateau in France, where the extended family of Capitaine Delarive lives. He marries late in life to a younger woman, and brings her and her brother back to France. There is a fire, he is killed. He has not revised his will after his marriage, so his widow inherits his wealth. The denouement is announced by Larosi√®re, who gets back on the case once he overcomes his grief for his good friend Delarive.

When the North South line Woodlands Extension was proposed in 1990, Kranji MRT station was not included on this planned route. It was later included as a provisional station to be built at a later stage. However, the government later decided to construct this station as part of the extension and also to serve the Singapore Turf Club.

At the behest of a pretty reporter, an amorously forward private detective goes undercover as a patient in a private sanitarium in search of a judge hiding out from the police. The two plan to split the $10,000 reward for the judge's capture. As the reporter and detective begin to fall in love, the detective also falls deeper into danger from an abusive attendant and difficult inpatients. The latter include an arsonist and \\"The Champ,\\" a lunatic ex-boxer who attacks anyone put into a room with him after he hears what sounds like a bell. The title \\"Human Gorilla\\" for this movie can be found on various copies of this movie.

Keith Phipps, writing for the Onion AV Club, wrote of the film, \\"A probable inspiration for Sam Fuller's Shock Corridor, Doors suffers in comparison; Fuller made transcendent B-movies, and this isn't one. In just about every other respect, however, it's everything it should be: fast-paced, stylishly shot, a little lurid, a little topical, and thoroughly entertaining.\\"http://avclub.com/content/node/3938 Film critic Dennis Schwartz gave the film a mixed review, writing, \\"Budd Boetticher directs a fast-paced low-budget B-film thriller with a far-fetched idea as its storyline and presents a shaky portrayal of the mental health profession. The film's claustrophobic and oppressive surroundings in a private mental hospital, moves this paranoiac tale somewhat into film noir territory ... No character was developed, the storyline never seemed believable, and despite the attempts made through the dark photography to create tension that wasn't possible because we didn't know enough about the lead characters and the villains were merely cardboard characters. Aside from being well directed, this melodrama has little else to recommend it. Boetticher is better known today for the many splendid Westerns he directed during the 1950s with Randolph Scott as star, which include Comanche Station, Ride Lonesome, and The Tall T.\\"Schwartz, Dennis .

History The Schwebel's brand was created by Joseph Schwebel and Dora Schwebel, a married couple that started baking bread in the kitchen of their Campbell, Ohio, home, in 1906. The Schwebels eventually began to sell bread to customers in nearby Youngstown, an event which marks the official beginning of the Schwebel's Bakery. In 1914, Dora and Joseph entered the world of retail sales by working out agreements with several local \\"mom and pop\\" stores ‚Äì a move that opened up new and more profitable sales channels for their fledgling business. To ensure that fresh bread was in the stores when customers asked for it, the young couple added more bakers to assist the family. Eventually, Schwebel's expanded its distribution to areas beyond Youngstown and relied on horses and wagons to transport their products. By 1923, Schwebel's secured its first fleet of trucks, with six vehicles on hand. That same year the Schwebel's invested $25,000 and built a small bakery complete with a store front for retail business. At this time, the family could bake and deliver 1,000 loaves a day using six delivery trucks. The bakery was improving but in the 1920s and 1930s the company had a temporary downfall. = Crisis and Renewal = Dora Schwebel faced many challenges during the late 1920s and 1930s. In 1928, Joseph Schwebel died suddenly at the age of 46 ‚Äì leaving Dora with six children and the family's business to run by herself. In 1928, many people believed the baking business was no place for a woman with young children. Dora Schwebel was told she should sell her bakery and stay home with her children, but she still kept the company, trying to continue the business she and her husband started. The stock market crashed in the fall of 1929, less than a year after Joseph Schwebel's passing, and Dora and her young family found out just how difficult running a business could be. Vowing to meet her obligations by working all day and all night if necessary, Dora negotiated a number of critical agreements that kept the business running in the face of national financial ruin. She built a new bakery in 1936 that doubled production and improved efficiency, and added to it in 1938 and again in 1941. By the late 1940s, demand for the company's products was growing by leaps and bounds as soldiers returned home from World War II and the baby boom began. 1950s and 60s In 1951, Dora and her children moved into a new facility on Youngstown's Midlothian Boulevard, outfitted with equipment and baking processes that would significantly help the business. The 1960s marked the beginning of the third generation's active participation in the company. Their entry would add vitality, new ideas, and a quest for rapid growth and expansion outside of Youngstown. In 1967, the popularity of Schwebel's Golden Rich Bread led to a successful national licensing program throughout the country. Expansion By the end of the 1970s, the company had noticeably expanded its distribution network. In rapid fashion, Schwebel's had now become a key player in the Canton, Ohio, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Cleveland, Ohio markets. In addition, the company had undertaken a significant bakery expansion program that fully automated the bread and buns lines, doubling capacity. Record growth characterized the 1980s and 1990s. As a result of several key acquisitions, Schwebel's had become a regional force in the baking industry. To complement this expansion the company added distribution facilities in Columbus, Ohio and Buffalo, New York. This period also heralded special baking agreements with Stouffer's, Pillsbury Company, and Disney's Epcot theme park. =Closures= Schwebel‚Äôs closed its plant in Cuyahoga Falls in 2013 and shifted some of the production there to its Solon, Ohio plant. The company closed its bakery outlet stores in Austintown and Warren in January 2019, and its outlet in Meadville, Pennsylvania in November 2018. On March 18, 2019, Schwebel‚Äôs announced would close its bakery in Solon and cut 204 jobs in May 2019. This will leave the company with approximately one thousand employees.

This station primarily serves students of adjacent educational institutions such as Anderson Serangoon Junior College and Nanyang Polytechnic, as well as the residential and industrial estates in the northern part of Ang Mo Kio. The section of tracks between this station and Khatib MRT station is the longest between any two stations on the North South Line. Opened on 7 November 1987, Yio Chu Kang station is one of the five stations that collectively make up Singapore's oldest MRT stations. History Yio Chu Kang MRT concourse Another view of the MRT platform Exterior of the station. Yio Chu Kang station was the northern terminus of the North South Line when it first opened on 7 November 1987 along with the first five stations of the MRT. Trains terminated at Platform A before reversing and crossing over to the adjacent track. On 3 March 2003, a 23-year-old drove his car onto an MRT track off Lentor Avenue, in the sector between Yio Chu Kang and Khatib, the first accident of its kind in the 15 years of MRT operations in Singapore. The accident occurred when the car, which was travelling at along Lentor Avenue ‚Äì the speed limit was ‚Äì mounted an kerb, crossed of grass verge (inclusive of a wide pavement), jumped over a drain, went through a fence away from the track, and went uphill onto a steep stone embankment before landing on the track. Witnesses tried to remove the car from the tracks to prevent a possible collision, however an oncoming train from Yio Chu Kang stopped their efforts. One of the witnesses signalled the train driver to stop. Although the train driver was not able to stop in time, he was able to slow the train down enough to prevent derailment. Installations of the half- height screen doors started on 15 August 2011, and began operation on 18 October that year. The station is installed with high-volume low-speed fans in operations since 24 August 2012. TITAN faregates were replaced in November that year. On 12 February 2015, a 29-year-old motorcyclist died after he was flung onto the MRT tracks between Khatib and Yio Chu Kang stations early on Thursday morning following a traffic accident on the Lentor flyover, similar to the 2003 accident.

(), is a legal status for a registered voluntary association in Germany. While any group may be called a ', registration as ' confers many legal benefits, because it confers the status of a juridical person rather than just a group of individuals. The legal status must be mentioned in the name as well. Like certain other corporate bodies, a eingetragener Verein can apply for the status of a charitable organization (Gemeinn√ºtzigkeit). Legal Basis The Civil Code of Germany regulates registered non-profit, and for- profit associations regarded as juridical persons (') in sections 2179 and any other associations by contract (' in sections 705740. The Verein is the basic type of a juridical person while the Gesellschaft is dogmatically more a partnership. Due to this theoretical distinction, the concept of Verein is also the legal basis for particular economic entities (') such as GmbH and Aktiengesellschaft, which are also endowed with juridical personhood. These are regulated in separate statutes as special economic associations but bear the same basic features. The ' (Act regulating the public law of associations) and the associated regulations ' contain specific provision on the rights and duties of in general. Membership All natural and juridical persons in Germany, including entities such as municipalities, counties and other entities under public law, can form associations and be member of an association. This means that associations are not limited to private clubs formed by natural persons but have a much broader scope. They can be very locally limited club-like institutions but also nationwide units representing important economocic or social groups. It is even possible that registered associations themself form a new association whose membership is composed entirely of associations (often called Dachverband). The statutory minimum number of members for forming a registered association is seven. The minimum number of members before a registered association needs to be dissolved is five. The largest associations can have over one million members, there is no legal limit concerning membership numbers. Medical jet flying for the ADAC, the largest German motoring association with millions of car drivers as members Registration The registration of ' is regulated in the Vereinsregisterverordning VRV (Regulations for the registry of associations). It requires registration of an e. V. with the association registry (') either kept at the district court of its seat or, if directed by state law, as a centralized register for the ' its seat is located in. Differences to Other Jurisdictions In other German-speaking countries such a distinction does not exist. But there may be legal requirements which oblige an association to register itself; for example, in Switzerland there is no association registry, but an association must be listed in the commercial register if its yearly turnover is high enough to legally require an audit ('). In Austria, all associations are registered in a special register, and having an e.V. in the name is not allowed.http://www.bmi.gv.at/cms/BMI_Vereinswesen/faq/Frage_01.aspx  References  Further reading   * Category:Austrian law Category:German business law Category:Legal entities Category:Swiss law Category:Non-profit organisations based in Germany de:Verein#Eingetragener Verein ","title":"Registered association (Germany)"},{"id":"2292690","text":"A Murder Is Announced is a work of detective fiction by Agatha Christie and first published in the UK by the Collins Crime Club in June 1950Chris Peers, Ralph Spurrier and Jamie Sturgeon. Collins Crime Club ‚Äì A checklist of First Editions. Dragonby Press (Second Edition) March 1999 (p. 15) and in the US by Dodd, Mead and Company in the same month.John Cooper and B.A. Pyke. Detective Fiction ‚Äì the collector's guide: Second Edition (pp. 82, 87) Scholar Press. 1994; American Tribute to Agatha Christie The UK edition sold for eight shillings and sixpence (8/6) and the US edition at $2.50. The novel features her detective Miss Marple and is considered a crime novel classic. The book was heavily promoted upon publication in 1950 as being Christie's fiftieth book, although in truth this figure could only be arrived at by counting in both UK and US short story collections. The storyline had previously been explored in Christie's Miss Marple short story \\"The Companion\\", where the characters also lived in Little Paddocks. Plot summary A notice appears in the paper of Chipping Cleghorn: \\"A murder is announced and will take place on Friday, 29 October, at Little Paddocks, at 6.30 pm. Friends accept this, the only intimation.\\" This surprises Letitia Blacklock, owner of Little Paddocks; however, she takes it in stride and prepares for guests that evening. The villagers are intrigued by the notice, and several of them appear with awkward reasons but definite interest. As the clock strikes 6.30, the lights go out and a door swing open, revealing a man with a blinding torch who demands the guests \\"Stick 'em up!\\" Most do so, believing it to be part of a game, but the game ends when shots are fired into the room. When the lights turn on, Miss Blacklock's ear is bleeding, from a bullet grazing her earlobe, and the gunman is dead on the ground. Dora Bunner (\\"Bunny\\") recognizes the gunman as Rudi Scherz, a foreigner who works as a receptionist at a local hotel, and who had asked Letitia for money a few days ago. The scene suggests to the police that this is a strange suicide or accidental death, but Inspector Craddock is not satisfied. Craddock is advised to involve Miss Marple, currently, a guest at the spa hotel where Scherz was employed, in the case, and the two work together. They learn that Scherz has a criminal background of petty theft and forgery. Scherz's girlfriend, a waitress at the spa, reveals that he had been paid to appear as the holdup man; he believed it was \\"a silly English joke\\". Craddock returns to Chipping Cleghorn, where Miss Marple stays with the local vicar's wife. Establishing a motive for Scherz's attack on Miss Blacklock is difficult. She worked for the financier Randall Goedler and has done well for herself but is not wealthy. However, she may inherit a great deal of money; Randall Goedler's estate passed to his wife Belle, who is now frail and ill. When Belle dies, Miss Blacklock inherits everything, but if she predeceases Belle, the estate goes to the mysterious \\"Pip\\" and \\"Emma\\", children of Randall's estranged sister, Sonia. Inspector Craddock discovers oil on the hinges of a door into the parlor, thought to be unused, and Bunny mentions that until recently there had been a table placed against the door. Craddock travels to Scotland to meet Belle; she mentions that Letitia had a beloved sister, Charlotte, who developed a goiter. Their father, a doctor, tried unsuccessfully to treat Charlotte, but she only withdrew further into herself as her goiter worsened. Their father died shortly before World War II, and Letitia gave up her job with Goedler and took her sister to Switzerland for surgery. The two sisters waited out the war in Switzerland, but before it was over, Charlotte died very suddenly. Letitia returned to England alone. Miss Marple takes tea with Bunny, and Bunny reveals the recently oiled door she found with the Inspector. She is sure that Patrick Simmons, a young cousin of Letitia's, is not as he appears. Simmons, with his sister Julia and Phillipa Haymes, a young widow, is staying at Little Paddocks. Bunny is also certain there was a different lamp in the room on the night of the murder, but their t√™te-√†-t√™te is interrupted when Letitia arrives. Letitia arranges a birthday party for Bunny, complete with almost everyone who was at the house when Scherz was killed. She asks Mitzi the cook to make her special cake, which Patrick has nicknamed \\"Delicious Death\\". After the party, Bunny has a headache, but she cannot find her recently purchased aspirin so takes some from a bottle in Letitia's room. The next day, Bunny is found dead. Miss Marple visits the mourning Miss Blacklock and asks to see photo albums which might contain pictures of Sonia Goedler, Pip, and Emma's mother, but all photos of Sonia have been removed from the albums. When Miss Blacklock receives a letter from the real Julia Simmons, she confronts the impostor, who reveals herself to be \\"Emma\\"; however, she denies attempting to kill Miss Blacklock and claims she has not seen her twin Pip. Through deduction and re- enactment, Misses Hinchcliffe and Murgatroyd (two spinsters present at the time of the Scherz shooting) figure out that Miss Murgatroyd, who was behind the opened door and thus not blinded by the torch, could see who was in the room when the torch shone on their faces.. The two women conclude that the person who was not in the room could have left the room when the lights went out and come around behind Scherz and shot him and at Miss Blacklock. Just as Miss Murgatroyd remembers the one person, not in the room, the phone rings, summoning Miss Hinchcliffe to the veterinarian. As Miss Hinchcliffe drives away, Murgatroyd runs into the driveway, shouting \\"She wasn't there!\\". When Miss Hinchcliffe returns, she meets with Miss Marple, and together they discover Murgatroyd's body, strangled. The distraught Hinchcliffe informs Miss Marple of Murgatroyd's cryptic statement. When the vicar's cat shorts out a lamp at the vicarage, the final clue falls into place for Miss Marple. Inspector Craddock gathers everyone at Little Paddocks, where Mitzi claims to have seen Miss Blacklock shoot Scherz. But Craddock dismisses her and accuses Edmund Swettenham (who, with his widowed mother, was also present at the shooting) of being Pip. However, Phillipa Haymes comes forward and confesses she is Pip. Craddock accuses Edmund of wanting to marry a rich wife in Phillipa by murdering Letitia, but as Edmund denies this, a scream is heard from the kitchen, where they find Miss Blacklock attempting to drown Mitzi in the sink. When Miss Blacklock hears Dora Bunner's voice, she releases Mitzi and breaks down, and is arrested. Miss Marple reveals the truth: it was not Charlotte who died in Switzerland, but Letitia. Aware that Letitia was in line to inherit a fortune, Charlotte posed as her deceased sister and returned to England, where few people knew her. She avoided people who knew Letitia well, such as Belle Goedler, and covered her throat with strings of pearls or beads to hide the scars from her goiter surgery. But Rudi Scherz could have exposed her, as he worked at the Swiss hospital where Charlotte had been treated and could identify her, which is why Charlotte killed him. Dora Bunner, whom Charlotte had taken into her confidence, was prone to slip-ups. On several occasions, she referred to Miss Blacklock as \\"Lotty\\" (short for \\"Charlotte\\") instead of \\"Letty\\" (short for \\"Letitia\\"), and her conversation with Miss Marple in the cafe proved fatal. Amy Murgatroyd was killed for realizing that Charlotte was the one person whose face was not illuminated by Rudi Scherz's torch. Miss Marple persuaded Mitzi and Edmund to play parts in tripping up Charlotte Blacklock; Phillipa's admission to being Pip was not planned, but Inspector Craddock managed to keep up the act and claim Edmund was after Phillipa's money. Mitzi had agreed to serve as the bait, and Miss Marple imitated Bunny's voice to cause Charlotte to break down. Ultimately, Phillipa and \\"Julia\\" inherit the Goedler fortune; Edmund and Phillipa get married and return to Chipping Cleghorn to live.

Literary significance and reception After five years of not reviewing any of Christie's detective novels, Julian MacLaren-Ross in The Times Literary Supplement was lavish in his praise of the book in the issue dated 23 June 1950: \\"A new novel by Mrs Agatha Christie always deserves to be placed at the head of any list of detective fiction and her fiftieth book, A Murder is Announced, establishes firmly her claim to the throne of detection. The plot is as ingenious as ever, the writing more careful, the dialogue both wise and witty; while suspense is engendered from the very start, and maintained skilfully until the final revelation: it will be a clever reader indeed who anticipates this, and though Miss Christie is as usual scrupulously fair in scattering her clues, close attention to the text is necessary if a correct solution of the mystery is to be arrived at before the astute Miss Marple unmasks the culprit.\\" The review concluded, \\"Miss Christie has several surprises up her sleeve besides the main one, and (this much may be said without spoiling the reader‚Äôs pleasure) she once again breaks new ground by creating a weak and kindly murderer who is yet responsible for the deaths of three people: that such a character should, in the last analysis, seem credible, is a tribute to the author‚Äôs psychological acumen and originality of concept.\\"The Times Literary Supplement, 23 June 1950 (p. 385) Maurice Richardson, in the 4 June 1950 issue of The Observer, said, \\"For her fiftieth book she has chosen a snug, residential village setting with her favourite detective, silver-haired, needle-sharp spinster, Miss Marple, making a delayed appearance. Not quite one of her top notchers, but very smooth entertainment. The Prime Minister (Clement Attlee), who is her fervent admirer, might fittingly celebrate this jubilee by making her a Dame.\\"The Observer, 4 June 1950 (p. 8) (It took until 1971 for Christie to be awarded the DBE). Norman Shrapnel in The Guardian's issue of 9 June 1950 noted that this was Christie's 50th book and said that the murderer was \\"run to earth in a brilliantly conducted parlour game\\".The Guardian, 9 June 1950 (p. 4) An unnamed reviewer in the Toronto Daily Star of 30 September 1950 opined that \\"A Murder is Announced displays all the adroit and well-bred legerdemain one has come to expect from Agatha Christie... This jubilee whodunit is as deft and ingenious a fabrication as Agatha Christie has contrived in many a year.\\"Toronto Daily Star, 30 September 1950 (p. 16) Robert Barnard: \\"Superb reworking of the standard Christie setting and procedures, marred only by an excess of homicide at the end. The book is distantly related to \\"The Companion\\", in The Thirteen Problems.\\"Barnard, Robert. A Talent to Deceive ‚Äì an appreciation of Agatha Christie ‚Äì rev. ed. (p. 198).

Film, TV, theatrical adaptations The Goodyear Playhouse showed an adaptation by William Templeton in 1956 with Gracie Fields as Miss Marple, Roger Moore as Patrick Simmons and Jessica Tandy as Letitia Blacklock. Leslie Darbon adapted the novel into a stage play in 1977. It was first presented at the Theatre Royal, Brighton, by Peter Saunders ‚Äì who brought Christie's The Mousetrap to the stage ‚Äì and then on 21 September 1977 at the Vaudeville Theatre, London, which he then owned. The play first toured Australia in 2013About A Murder Announced with Judi Farr as Miss Marple, Robert Grubb as Inspector Craddock, Libby Munro as Phillipa Haymes, directed by Darren Yap. The novel was adapted by Alan Plater and filmed in 1985 with Joan Hickson as Miss Marple and Ursula Howells as Miss Blacklock, directed by David Giles for the BBC series Miss Marple. Only a few changes were made: Mitzi was renamed Hannah and is said to be Swiss (in the book, her nationality is unknown) and in the novel the vicarage cat was male and called Tiglath Pileser. In the film the cat was female and called Delilah.

History Exterior view of the station from a distnce. On 16 March 1997, Sunday at 8.15 am, a man in his late 60s leapt down from the platform and was believed to have died instantly as a west-bound train approached travelling at 50 km per hour. The impact threw him against the side of the tracks, and he sustained serious head injuries, a fractured left arm and a severed right foot. He was pronounced dead at the scene at 10.55 am. An SMRT spokesman said that the train was operated through an automated system, and all trains approaching the waiting area would have reduced their speed automatically. By 11 am, the entire area had been cordoned off. None of the 300 commuters on board the train was hurt as it made an emergency stop at 10.17 am. For two hours, all train services between Eunos and Tanah Merah were discontinued to allow cleaners to clear the tracks. Commuters affected were being directed to a nearby bus stop. On 8 October 2010, Friday at about 7 pm, passengers on board a westbound MRT train were evacuated on Friday evening at this station after smoke was detected in one of its carriages. An announcement was made for passengers to alight at Kembangan station and wait for the next train. As with most of the above- ground stations built in the past along the East West Line, it was built without platform screen doors. After several successful test at Jurong East, Yishun and Pasir Ris and eventually, installation of the half-height screen doors to prevent commuters from falling onto the train tracks. Installation started in December 2010 and the platform screen doors started operations on 25 February 2011 with Kallang. This station is also installed with high-volume low-speed fans, which started operating 14 July 2012, together with Paya Lebar station.

The book was inspired by Christie's own trips to Baghdad with her second husband, archaeologist Sir Max Mallowan, and is also one of few Christie novels belonging to the action and spy fiction genres, rather than to mysteries and whodunnits. Plot summary A secret summit of superpowers is to be held in Baghdad, but it is no longer secret. A shadowy group (which is both anti-Communist and anti-Capitalist) is plotting to sabotage the event. Things get complicated when enthusiastic young \\"adventurer\\" Victoria Jones discovers a dying secret British agent ‚Äì Henry \\"Fakir\\" Carmichael ‚Äì in her hotel room. His last words ‚Äì \\"Lucifer...Basrah...Lefarge\\" ‚Äì propel her into investigation. \\"Lucifer\\" refers to the mastermind, Victoria's false lover Edward, who is behind the plot. \\"Basrah\\" is the city where Carmichael saw Edward and recognised him as an enemy. \\"Lefarge\\" turns out to actually be \\"Defarge\\" and is a reference to a Charles Dickens character; it is an allusion to the fact that the name of a vital witness has been stitched into a scarf. While Victoria is the central character, the real heroine is Anna Scheele, secretary/executive assistant to an American banker, who has discovered a great deal about finances of the shadowy group. She appears rather sparingly, with a few brief appearances in the early part of the story, then seems to vanish, to the chagrin of the evil organization who fear her financial knowledge and who want to liquidate her, and of her allies who wish to protect her. She is presumed dead by her allies but she reappears at the eleventh hour in a most surprising manner. Themes An interesting comparison can be made between the romance themes of this novel and The Man in the Brown Suit, which is also primarily an adventure novel, rather than a straight whodunnit. In that book, the exciting, mysterious young man that falls into the heroine's room ends up as the romantic hero. In Baghdad, an exciting, mysterious young man also falls into the heroine's room, but he is disposed of, as is the other exciting, mysterious young man that the heroine has followed to Baghdad. A more conventional and staid archaeologist ends up as the romantic hero; Christie herself was married to Mallowan by this date. =References to actual history, geography and current science= They Came To Baghdad is one of the few Agatha Christie novels where one of the minor characters is a real person. When Victoria first comes to Baghdad, she visits the Tio Hotel, where she meets a bartender named Jesus. Jesus was a Chaldean Christian bartender from northern Iraq. He makes a brief appearance in Archibald Bulloch Roosevelt, Jr.'s book For Lust of Knowing: Memoirs of an Intelligence Officer. Literary significance and reception Julian MacLaren- Ross enthusiastically reviewed the novel in the 20 April 1951 issue of The Times Literary Supplement when he said it was: \\"more of a thriller than a detective story, though there are plenty of mysteries and two surprises reserved for the closing chapters; one of these is perhaps her best since the unmasking of the criminal in The Seven Dials Mystery\\". He went on to comment on that, \\"the easy expertise of the writing is once more a matter for admiration\\" and concluded that Christie's powers of invention \\"never fail her\\".The Times Literary Supplement, 20 April 1951 (p. 241). Maurice Richardson of The Observer (4 March 1951) wrote: \\"A bit light and frilly, in parts almost giggly, as Agatha Christie's thrillers are apt to be, but it has the usual creamy readability and a deeply planted fiend.\\" Robert Barnard: \\"Fairly preposterous example of thriller-type Christie, but livelier than some. Engaging heroine and unusually good minor characters ‚Äì archeologists, hotelkeeper, etc. The plot concerns attempts to prevent The Big Three (Britain was one of them then) from coming together and making peace.

The contract for the construction of Aljunied station and associated viaducts was awarded to Lee Kim Tah Ltd at a contract sum of S$59.52 million on November 1985. The contractor had partnered with a French company Societe Generale D'Enterprises Sainrapt Et Brice (SGE) for the construction. The contract also includes the construction of the Kallang and Paya Lebar stations. The station opened earlier than expected on 4 November 1989. On 26 June 2009, train services along the East West line were disrupted for almost 18 minutes at about 7:25pm after a man jumped off the platform and ran towards Paya Lebar station. However, SMRT staff did not manage to find the man. The Chinese man in his 40s found his way down the tracks to the street but was later arrested by the police. He sustained leg injuries and was charged with attempted suicide. As part of efforts to improve overall accessibility of public transport, the overhead pedestrian bridge near Aljunied and other stations (Sengkang, Bishan, Khatib, Kranji and Yew Tee) have lifts installed to improve barrier free accessibility to major transport nodes.

Collins Crime Club ‚Äì A checklist of First Editions. Dragonby Press (Second Edition) March 1999 (Page 15) The US edition retailed at $2.50 and the UK edition nine shillings and sixpence (9/6). The Detective Book Club issued an edition, also in 1952, as Blood Will Tell. The novel features the characters Hercule Poirot and Ariadne Oliver. The story is a \\"village mystery\\", a subgenre of whodunit which Christie usually reserved for Miss Marple. The novel is notable for its wit and comic detail, something that had been little in evidence in the Poirot novels of the 1930s and 1940s. Poirot's misery in the run-down guesthouse, and Mrs Oliver's observations on the life of a detective novelist, provide considerable entertainment in the early part of the novel. The publication of Mrs McGinty's Dead may be considered as marking the start of Poirot's final phase, in which Ariadne Oliver plays a large part. Although she had appeared in Cards on the Table in 1936, Mrs Oliver's most significant appearances in Christie's work begin here. She appears in five of the last nine Christie novels featuring Poirot to be written, and appears on her own without Poirot at all in The Pale Horse (1961). Plot introduction Poirot, disillusioned by the \\"senseless cruel brutality\\" of modern crime, pays no attention to the sad case of Mrs McGinty, an old woman apparently struck dead by her lodger for thirty pounds that she kept under a floorboard. When, however, he is asked by the investigating officer to take another look at the case to stop an innocent man going to the gallows, he realises that things may not be as simple as they appear. Plot summary Superintendent Spence informs Hercule Poirot of the case of Mrs McGinty, an elderly charwoman, apparently killed by her lodger, James Bentley, for her savings of ¬£30, which she kept under a floorboard. Bentley is convicted and to be executed for the crime, but Spence does not think he is guilty. Poirot agrees to go to the town of Broadhinny and investigate the murder further. Poirot finds that Mrs McGinty often worked as a cleaner at the houses of people in the village. No one wants to talk to Poirot, and most believe Bentley is the killer. During a search among Mrs McGinty's possessions, Poirot finds a newspaper from which an article has been cut out. The newspaper is dated a few days before the murder. He later discovers that the missing article is about women connected with famous murder cases, and includes photographs of them. He also discovers that Mrs McGinty had purchased a bottle of ink in a local shop shortly before her murder. He concludes that she had recognised one of the women in the article, and had written to the paper in question. Someone must have found out about it and then killed her to prevent her from talking. Poirot and Spence, using the ages of people in the town, conclude that someone is either Lily Gamboll, who committed murder with a meat cleaver as a child, or Eva Kane, who had been the love interest who inspired a man to murder his wife and bury her in a cellar. Another possibility is that someone is Evelyn Hope, the daughter of Eva Kane. Shortly afterwards, Poirot discovers the murder weapon, a sugar hammer, left around in plain sight at his boarding house and accessible to all the suspects. In an attempt to flush out the murderer, Poirot claims to know more than he does and is nearly pushed under an oncoming train. Poirot decides to show most of the suspects the photos at a party. Mrs Upward claims to have seen the photo of Lily Gamboll, but does not say where. The following day, Poirot is contacted by Maude Williams, who had approached him a few days earlier, telling him that she had known Bentley when they worked together briefly for the same estate agents. She told Poirot that she liked Bentley and did not believe he was guilty or even capable of murdering Mrs McGinty. She now offers to help Poirot who takes up her offer by getting her to pose as a maid in the house of Mrs Wetherby, a resident in the village for whom Mrs McGinty worked as housekeeper, and whose daughter, Deirdre, Poirot suspects may have some connection with the circumstances surrounding Mrs McGinty's murder. During the maid's night off, Mrs Upward's spoiled son Robin, a somewhat flamboyant theatre director, and Ariadne Oliver, a famed mystery novelist who has been working on a theatre adaptation with Robin, leave for an evening at the theatre, leaving Mrs Upward alone at the house. When they return, they find Mrs Upward strangled to death. She has evidently had coffee with her murderer, and the lipstick on a coffee cup and perfume in the air points to a woman having committed the crime. Mrs Upward had invited three people to her house that night: Eve Carpenter, Deirdre Henderson and Shelagh Rendell. Any of the three women could be someone from the photographs. Additionally, the postmistress's assistant, Edna, saw someone with blonde hair enter the house, which points to either Carpenter or Rendell, as Henderson is not blonde. Confusing matters even further is the fact that a book is discovered in the Upward house with Evelyn Hope's signature written on the flyleaf, suggesting Mrs Upward was actually Eva Kane. Poirot connects the final piece of the puzzle when he finds the photo Mrs McGinty saw at Maureen Summerhayes' house. It is of Eva Kane and has the inscription ‚Äúmy mother‚Äù on the back. Poirot gathers the suspects together and reveals the murderer ‚Äì Robin Upward. Robin is Eva Kane's son, Evelyn, which can be a man's name as well as a woman's. Mrs Upward had not known who was the mother of her adopted son, but he realised that any scandal would be to his detriment. Mrs McGinty saw the photo of Eva Kane while working at the Upward house and assumed the photo was of Mrs Upward as a young woman. Robin killed her to prevent her from telling anyone who might recognise the photo, and framed Bentley by stealing the ¬£30, correctly assuming Bentley would incriminate himself by panicking. Mrs Upward thought Kane's photograph to be similar to a photo Robin had shown her of his mother, whose back story he made up. She wanted to confront Robin by herself, so she pointed to the wrong photo (that of Lily Gamboll) to put Poirot off the scent. Robin, however, sensed the truth and killed her before leaving for the play. Then he planted the evidence and made the three calls to make it appear that a woman had committed the crime. At this point he still had the photo, but rather than destroy it, he kept it and planted it at Mrs Summerhayes' house to incriminate her. But Poirot had gone through the drawer earlier and did not see the photo, so he knew it had been planted subsequently. Further revelations are also made. Eve Carpenter wanted to conceal her past for reasons of her own, which was why she didn't co-operate in the investigation. Poirot discovers that Dr Rendell may have killed his first wife, which led Mrs Rendell to talk about anonymous letters she'd received warning her of the fact. Poirot now suspects it was Dr Rendell, convinced that Poirot was in Broadhinny to investigate the death of his first wife, and not that of Mrs McGinty, who tried to push him under the oncoming train, not Robin. Maude Williams turns out to be the daughter of Eva Kane's lover, and has always believed that her mother was murdered by Eva and that her father took the blame. She came to see Mrs Upward, who she thought was Eva Kane, intending to confront her, but found her dead and left quietly. She admits this to Poirot, who agrees to keep it a secret and wishes her good luck in her life.

Literary significance and reception No review of this book appeared in the Times Literary Supplement. Maurice Richardson of The Observer of 23 March 1952 thought that Poirot was \\"slightly subdued\\" and summed up \\"Not one of A.C's best-constructed jobs, yet far more readable than most other people's.\\"The Observer 4 March 1951 (p. 7) Robert Barnard: \\"This village murder begins among the rural proletariat (cf. Death by Drowning in The Thirteen Problems and the excellent London working-class woman in The Hollow), but after a time it moves toward the better-spoken classes. Poirot suffers in a vividly awful country guesthouse in order to get in with the community and rescue a rather unsatisfactory young man from the gallows. Highly ingenious ‚Äì at this point she is still able to vary the tricks she plays, not repeat them.\\"Barnard, Robert. A Talent to Deceive ‚Äì an appreciation of Agatha Christie ‚Äì Revised edition (p. 197). Fontana Books, 1990. References to other works * When Superintendent Spence arrives to see Poirot, the detective reacts to him as though it has been many years since the case on which they worked. The case in question was, however, the one retold in Taken at the Flood, which is the previous novel in the series, and was explicitly set in 1946. At most, it can only have been six years since they last worked together. Of course, chronologies are difficult to construct, especially with Poirot's career. * Poirot refers in the first chapter to a case in which the resemblance between his client and a soap manufacturer proved significant. This is the case of \\"The Nemean Lion\\", first published in the Strand Magazine in November 1939 and later collected in The Labours of Hercules (1947). * Mrs Oliver, who is a very amiable caricature of Dame Agatha herself, remarks about her gaffes in her books. In chapter 12, she mentions one of her novels (actually a thinly veiled reference to Christie's own Death in the Clouds) in which she had made a blowpipe one foot long, instead of six. * \\"Evelyn Hope‚Äù is the name of a poem by Robert Browning that is quoted in the course of the novel. In Taken at the Flood Christie had made a character take the alias of \\"Enoch Arden\\", which is a poem by Tennyson. Adaptations=Film= The novel was adapted by MGM in 1964 as the film Murder Most Foul. However, in an unusual move, the character of Poirot was replaced with Christie's other most famous detective Miss Marple (portrayed by Margaret Rutherford), who comes onto the case when she is a juror in the trial of the lodger who is accused of the murder. As she is the only juror to believe the lodger is innocent and will not join with the others to vote guilty. The jury foreman says to the judge that they cannot make up their minds. The judge rules for a mistrial and arranges for a retrial for a week's time, giving Miss Marple seven days to solve the case. =Television= A television programme was produced in 2007 with David Suchet as Poirot in the ITV series Agatha Christie's Poirot, first broadcast on 14 September 2008. It was directed by Ashley Pearce, who also directed Appointment with Death and Three Act Tragedy for the ITV series. It also starred Zo√´ Wanamaker returning as Ariadne Oliver (who first appeared in Cards on the Table) and Richard Hope as Superintendent Spence (who first appeared in Taken at the Flood), respectively. The adaptation is reasonably faithful to the novel, with the deletion of a few characters and omitting two of the women from the newspaper article ‚Äì only focusing on Lily Gamboll and Eva Kane. The characters of Deirdre Henderson and Maude Wiliams are merged in the film. As such it is Maude Williams, the estate agents' secretary (with dark hair instead of blonde), who is in love with Bentley and helps Poirot throughout his investigation. Maude and Bentley are reunited by Poirot in the final scene.At the PBS website for viewing the entire episode, or its various chapters, is the following description of the last scene of the film (Chapter 10: \\"Secrets of the Past\\"): \\"While Poirot and Bentley's colleague Maude Williams wait for Bentley, Poirot reveals her secrets.\\" [Emphasis added.] \\" Secrets of the Past‚Äù, Mrs McGinty's Dead.

He was the first to win Comic-Con International's Russ Manning Most Promising Newcomer Award in 1982, and received both an Inkpot Award and the Kirby Award for Best Graphic Album in 1986.

Despite its erratic publishing history, the Rocketeer proved to be one of the first successful features to emerge from the burgeoning independent comics movement. Influenced by Golden Age artists Will Eisner, Lou Fine, Reed Crandall, Maurice Whitman, Frank Frazetta and Wally Wood,About Dave Stevens ‚Äì The Dave Stevens Web Site Stevens was widely recognized, along with artists such as Steve Rude and Jaime Hernandez, as one of the finest comic book artists of his generation. Stevens was a longtime admirer of 1950s glamour and pin-up model Bettie Page; he modeled the look of the Rocketeer's girlfriend after her and featured her image in other illustrations too, which helped contribute to the renewed public interest in Page and her modeling career. After discovering that the retired Page was still alive and lived nearby, Stevens became friends with her, providing both personal assistance and helping to arrange financial compensation to her from various publishers for the use of her image and reprints of her many glamor and pin-up photos. Two other characters that show up in the Rocketeer stories were based on personal acquaintances of Stevens: the \\"Peevy\\" character, based on cartoonist Doug Wildey, and the sleazy \\"Marco of Hollywood\\" character, based on real life glamour and porn photographer Ken Marcus. Comic book series The first comic book featuring the Rocketeer was released in 1982. Those first stories appeared as a second feature in issues #2 and #3 of Mike Grell's Pacific Comics' Starslayer series. For its next two installments, Steven's feature moved to the anthology comic title Pacific Presents #1 and #2. The fourth chapter ended in a cliffhanger that was later concluded in a lone Rocketeer comic released by Eclipse Comics.The Comics Reporter The character was then continued in the Rocketeer Adventure Magazine, with two issues being published in 1988 and then 1989 by Comico Comics; a third and final issue was published six years later in 1995 by Dark Horse Comics. Stevens' extensive background research and meticulous approach to his illustrations contributed to the long delays between Rocketeer issues. The first completed story line was then collected into a graphic novel by Eclipse Comics, in both trade paperback and hardcover formats, and simply titled The Rocketeer (); the second story line was collected into a glossy trade paperback graphic novel by Dark Horse called The Rocketeer: Cliff's New York Adventure (). IDW Publishing announced a hardcover edition collecting the entire Rocketeer series for the first time, due originally in October 2009. Dave Steven's The Rocketeer, The Complete Adventures would contain all-new coloring by Laura Martin who was chosen by Dave Stevens before his untimely death. The book finally appeared in December of that year in two separate states: a trade hardcover edition with full color dust jacket and a second, more lavish, deluxe hardcover edition () of 3000 copies. The deluxe edition sold out almost immediately upon publication, and IDW announced a second printing. In 2011 IDW launched an all-new Rocketeer comic book series, illustrated by various artists, called Rocketeer Adventures; the series features four quarterly issues per year (the second series of four began appearing in May 2012). The four 2011 issues were then collected by IDW and published in hardcover as a graphic novel. All four issues in each series offers additional variant covers in shorter-run editions, some of them reprinting Stevens original Rocketeer cover art in both full color and just black and white. A second IDW four-issue comics miniseries of Rocketeer adventures, Rocketeer: Cargo of Doom, began appearing in 2012. Each issue offered a regular retail cover design and one alternate Retailer Incentive cover. In addition publisher Jet Pack Comics issued several additional Retailer Incentive variants with Dave Stevens re-colored artwork reprinted on their covers. The miniseries was then collected into two variant graphic novel hardcovers, one offered with a regular dust jacket, the other without. A third IDW four-issue comic book miniseries of Rocketeer adventures, Rocketeer: Hollywood Horror, began appearing in late February 2013. As with the previous series, each issue offered a regular retail cover design and one Retailer Incentive alternate cover. The miniseries was then collected into two variant graphic novel hardcovers, one with a regular dust jacket, the other without. A fourth IDW Rocketeer comics miniseries, Rocketeer and The Spirit: Pulp Friction, began appearing in 2013, as another limited four-issue miniseries. As with the two previous miniseries, each issue offered a regular retail cover design and one Retailer Incentive alternate cover. A special San Diego Comic Con International promotional variant issue #1, with a black and white wraparound cover, was offered only at the 2013 convention. The miniseries was then collected into two variant graphic novel hardcovers, one with a regular dust jacket, the other without. In September 2014, IDW changed the Rocketeer's format and published a 376-page, 6x9 trade paperback The Rocketeer: Jet-Pack Adventures, an original anthology featuring ten short prose stories by Cody Goodfellow, Don Webb, Gregory Frost, J Bone, Lisa Morton, Nancy A. Collins, Nancy Holder, Nicholas Kaufmann, Robert Hood, Simon Kurt Unsworth, and Yvonne Navarro. =Other work= Stevens began developing a Rocketeer theatrical film proposal in 1985 and then sold the rights to his character to the Walt Disney Company, which then developed and produced the 1991 film The Rocketeer. The film was directed by Joe Johnston, and starred Billy Campbell, Jennifer Connelly, Alan Arkin and Timothy Dalton. Stevens was a hands-on co-producer of the film. It received a mixture of highly positive and lukewarm reviews and disappointing domestic ticket sales, ensuring no immediate sequels would follow. Dave Stevens always felt that a majority of the problem was that the studio's movie poster and promotional graphics were over-stylized, vague, and didn't convey to people what the film was all about. After the Walt Disney Company purchased the Rocketeer character for film production, comics artist Russ Heath illustrated a promotional film tie-in graphic novel, The Rocketeer: The Official Movie Adaptation, based on their feature film. Following The Rocketeer, Stevens worked primarily as an illustrator, doing a variety of ink and painted illustrations for book and comic book covers, posters, prints, portfolios, and private commissions, including a number of covers for Comico's Jonny Quest title and a series of eight covers for Eclipse comics, featuring characters such as Airboy and the DNAgents. The Eclipse covers were also published in the form of large posters.\\"Comics Warehouse Index of Eclipse Posters, Portfolios, and Miscellanea\\" Published 1995. Retrieved July 30, 2014.

The US edition retailed at $2.50 and the UK edition at ten shillings and sixpence (10/6). The book features her detective Miss Marple. One review at the time of publication praised the essence of the plot but felt the latter half of the novel moved too slowly. A later review considered that this novel showed \\"Definite signs of decline.\\" and felt the author was not entirely comfortable with the setting she described in the novel. Plot summary While visiting her American school friend Ruth Van Rydock in London, Miss Marple learns that Ruth is seriously concerned for her sister Carrie Louise. She asks Miss Marple to visit Carrie Louise at Stonygates, her home in England. Miss Marple agrees to the visit. She is impressed by the size of the Victorian mansion, which now has a separate building for delinquent boys, the cause which engages Carrie Louise and her third husband, Lewis Serrocold. Carrie Louise has her family living with her, as her granddaughter Gina has brought her American husband Walter to England to meet her family. Daughter Mildred Strete moved back home after she was widowed. Stepsons Stephen and Alexis Restarick, now grown, are frequent visitors and are present during Miss Marple's visit. One of the first people Miss Marple encounters is young Edgar Lawson, a young man acting as a secretary to Serrocold; Lawson shows clear signs of paranoid schizophrenia, but these are largely ignored. Miss Marple learns that Carrie Louise has experienced health problems incident to old age. Nevertheless, Miss Marple is pleased to see that Carrie Louise is still the sweet, idealistic, and loving person she has known. An unexpected visitor arrives at Stonygates‚ÄîChristian Gulbrandsen, Carrie Louise's stepson from her first marriage and a trustee of the charitable foundation that his father set up with the wealth he generated in his life. Lewis Serrocold walks from the train station and meets Christian on the terrace. Miss Marple watches them through her bird-watcher's binoculars and tries to learn the reason for Christian's unexpected visit. She hears a few phrases concerning the importance of keeping a problem from Carrie Louise, and that the two men agree to call for outside help. Both men enter for dinner, and afterwards, Christian retires to his room to write letters. The rest of the household is held entranced by a scene that plays out in the office of Lewis Serrocold. Lawson enters it with a gun, locks the door, and speaks loudly to Lewis, claiming Lewis is his father and has treated him badly. Lawson threatens to shoot him, while Lewis tries to calm the young man. Tension is added to the scene because an electrical problem has caused most of the ‚ÄúGreat Hall‚Äù outside Lewis's office to go dark. Walter knows how to fix the overloaded fuse, so he leaves the room to fix it and then rejoins the group. While Edgar Lawson is ranting to Lewis, the family hear shots and intervene by trying to open the door. Another shot (not fired in Lewis's office) had been heard by some, but not all. When the door to Lewis's office is finally opened, Lewis scoffs at any concern for himself, and they see that the shots Lawson fired had hit the wall. Lawson collapses in tears and apologies. Meanwhile, \\"Jolly\\" Juliet Bellever, housekeeper and companion to Carrie Louise, had gone out to find the key to the office. She returns to the room and says she has called the police, not because of the scene between Edgar Lawson and Lewis Serrocold, but because she has found Christian Gulbrandsen dead in his room from a gunshot. Lewis proceeds to Christian's room, followed by Carrie Louise and Miss Marple. Alexis Restarick arrives at the house. His brother Stephen was already there, playing the piano after dinner. Then the police arrive. Inspector Curry quickly establishes that none of the people from the facility for delinquent boys are involved, nor any of the servants either. Curry discovers that there was a sheet of paper in the typewriter when Jolly entered the dead man's room. Lewis admits to removing it, explaining that he had feared his wife would read it and discover that the reason for Christian's visit was his fear that someone had been poisoning Carrie Louise. Lewis suggests that the poison is in her medicine, a liquid which is shown to contain arsenic. Miss Marple comments that most of the family would be pleased if Walter were found to be the killer, but Christian was not killed by Walter's gun, which was in Lawson's hand during the interval. Police find the murder weapon under some music inside the piano bench. Alexis explains that his drive to the house was slowed by the fog, and that what he saw and heard in the fog, such as a shot and the sound of someone running, gave him an idea for a stage set. Alexis envisions the house as a stage, which causes Miss Marple to begin thinking differently about the murder. The next evening, Alexis and the boy Ernie Gregg are killed by stage weights. Miss Marple explains to the police how one person could run from Lewis's study to Christian's room along the terrace in under two minutes‚ÄîLewis Serrocold. Lawson spoke as both himself and Lewis, while Lewis killed Christian and returned out of breath. The suspicion of Carrie Louise's poisoning was a ruse created by Lewis. The real reason for Christian Gulbrandsen's visit was that he had learned that Lewis was embezzling from the Gulbrandsen Trust. The reader also learns that Edgar Lawson was only pretending to be schizophrenic; in reality, he is the illegitimate son of Lewis. When confronted by the police, Lawson flees the house, jumping into an old boat to cross a lake on the property. The boat begins to sink, so Lewis Serrocold jumps into the lake to rescue his son. Both are caught in the reeds lining the lake and drown before the police can reach them. The scene of these deaths ends with Carrie Louise walking indoors with her daughter Mildred, as a new solidarity between mother and daughter is manifest. Carrie Louise's granddaughter Gina agrees to head back to America with her American husband Walter, averting a threatened separation.

Title In the text, Miss Marple says \\"they do it with mirrors\\" is the slang term for the illusions of magicians and of a stage set. It is thinking of that which leads her to looking a new way at the evening of the first murder. Literary significance and reception Maurice Richardson of The Observer of 30 November 1952 summed up thus: \\"First half is lively and the trick alibi for the murder of the stepson neat enough; there is a marked decline in sprightliness later on, but half a shot is better than no dope.\\" Robert Barnard said of this novel that its setting was: \\"Unusual (and not entirely convincing) setting of delinquent's home, full of untrustworthy adolescents and untrustworthy do-gooders. Christie not entirely at home, perhaps because she believes (in Miss Marple's words) that 'young people with a good heredity, and brought up wisely in a good home‚Ä¶they are really‚Ä¶the sort of people a country needs.' Otherwise highly traditional, with houseplans, Marsh-y inquisitions, and second and third murders done most perfunctorily.\\" He summed it up as showing \\"Definite signs of decline.\\" Publication history Dustjacket illustration of the UK First Edition (Book was first published in the US) * 1952, Dodd Mead and Company (New York), 1952, Hardback, 187 pp * 1952, Collins Crime Club (London), 17 November 1952, Hardback, 192 pp * 1954, Pocket Books (New York), Paperback, 165 pp * 1956, Fontana Books (Imprint of HarperCollins), Paperback, 187 pp * 1966, Ulverscroft Large-print Edition, Hardcover, 224 pp * 1969, Greenway edition of collected works (William Collins), Hardcover, 223 pp * 1970, Greenway edition of collected works (Dodd Mead), Hardcover, 223 pp * 1974, Pan Books, Paperback, 187 pp * 2005, Marple Facsimile edition (Facsimile of 1952 UK first edition), 7 November 2005, Hardcover, A condensed version of the novel was first published in the US in Cosmopolitan magazine in the issue for April 1952 (Volume 132, Number 4) under the title Murder With Mirrors with illustrations by Joe Bowler.

Shelfmark: NPL LON LD116. Film, TV or theatrical adaptations Several adaptations were made of the book for TV and Film: The novel's first adaptation was the 1985 television film Murder with Mirrors with Sir John Mills as Lewis Serrocold, Bette Davis as Carrie Louise, Tim Roth as Edgar Lawson and Helen Hayes as Miss Marple. A second adaptation was aired on 29 December 1991 in the BBC series Miss Marple starring Joan Hickson as Miss Marple, Jean Simmons as Carrie-Louise Serrocold, Joss Ackland as Lewis Serrocold and Faith Brook as Ruth van Rydock. The film was basically faithful to the novel, with the exception that Alexis survives the attack on his life. Also, Ruth van Rydock is present at the house when the first murder takes place and Lawson attempts to swim across the lake, and does not use a rotted boat. A third adaptation was aired on 1 January 2010 for the fourth season of the ITV series Agatha Christie's Marple, starring Julia McKenzie as Miss Marple, Penelope Wilton as Carrie Louise, Brian Cox as Lewis Serrocold, and Joan Collins as Ruth Van Rydock. This adaptation has several notable changes and additions: * Alexis Restarick is replaced by Johnny Restarick, Steven's father and Carrie Louise's ex-husband. Rather than arriving after the murder, Johnny arrives near the end of the confrontation between Lawson and Lewis and disarms Lawson, just before Mr Gulbrandsen's murder is revealed. * While Edgar Lawson's character and role in the murders remains unchanged, his death was changed slightly in two ways - firstly, he is exposed for his involvement in the murders by Miss Marple, rather than confronted by the police, and secondly, he does not use a rotted boat to escape, but swims over the lake on the property. Lewis' efforts to rescue him remain unchanged. * Pippa is deleted and Gina becomes Carrie Louise's adopted daughter in this version, rather than her adopted granddaughter. * Gina's real mother was changed to Katherine Ellsworth, and her death was explained to have been from a hanging, after she was found guilty of committing arsenic poisoning on three counts. Gina discovers this fact and exposes her connection to it, moments before Alexis' death, and how she found it out is revealed, by Miss Marple's investigations, to be the fault of Mildred, who had resented her being given more attention than her. * While the confrontation scene between Lawson and Lewis still was basis for the first murder and retained certain elements from the original plot, it was modified considerably for the adaptation: ** Everyone, bar Mr Gulbrandsen, goes to the study to witness a dress rehearsal, not to the Great Hall, and so witness in person the confrontation between the two men. ** Lawson's reason for confronting Lewis is changed; he accuses Lewis of spying on him, rather than being his real father. ** Wally is made the initial suspect in the murder, owing to his absence to fix the fuses and the murder weapon being his. The police only begin to look elsewhere, and later to Johnny, when Gina reveals the study has a secret passage that links it to the hallway; Miss Marple explains in her denouement that the passage was merely a red herring, before explaining Lewis' crimes. * A new character was introduced - Whitstable Ernest, a young man serving time for fraud and embezzlement. Ernest helped Lewis with his financial corruption in exchange for rewards such as oysters and alcohol. When Lewis knew that Mr Gulbrandsen was going to expose him, Ernest torched all the records of his actions, which Miss Marple suspected when she smelt petroleum in the secret passage. When Johnny began to question Ernest, Lewis realised the danger he could create and so gave him oysters laced with arsenic; this did not kill him, but merely kept him out of harm's way. This adaptation had two murders, not three. There is a French television production aired in 2013, Les Petits Meurtres d'Agatha Christie, season two, first episode, \\"Jeux de glaces\\", which can mean \\"Game of Mirrors\\". Some elements of the plot were also incorporated into the 1964 film Murder Ahoy!, which starred Margaret Rutherford as Miss Marple, along with a token tribute to The Mousetrap. Instead of a sprawling Victorian estate, the delinquent boys are housed on board a retired ship called the Battledore, and they go ashore periodically to commit mischief under the direction of their criminal mastermind. Apart from these elements, however, this film is not based on any of Christie's works.

For a number of years he exercised considerable influence upon the literary movement in Germany; he helped to found the Frankfurter gelehrte Anzeigen in 1772, and was one of the chief contributors to Nicolai's Allgemeine Bibliothek. In 1773 he accompanied the Landgravine Karoline of Hesse-Darmstadt to Saint Petersburg, and on his return was a guest of the duke Charles Augustus of Weimar in the Wartburg.

The UK edition retailed at ten shillings and sixpence (10/6) and the US edition at $2.75. The book features her detective Miss Marple. Like several of Christie's novels (e.g., Hickory Dickory Dock and One, Two, Buckle My Shoe) the title and substantial parts of the plot reference a nursery rhyme, in this case \\"Sing a Song of Sixpence\\". Miss Marple travels to the Fortescue home to offer information on the maid, Gladys Martin. She works with Inspector Neele until the mysteries are revealed. Two reviewers at the time of publication felt that \\"the hidden mechanism of the plot is ingenious at the expense of probability\\" and that the novel was \\"Not quite so stunning as some of Mrs Christie's criminal assaults upon her readers\\". Christie's overall high quality in writing detective novels led one to say \\"they ought to make her a Dame\\". Writing later, another reviewer felt that the characters included an \\"exceptionally nasty family of suspects\\" in what was \\"Still, a good, sour read.\\" Plot summary When London businessman Rex Fortescue dies after drinking his morning tea, Scotland Yard Detective Inspector Neele spearheads the investigation. An autopsy reveals that the cause of death was poisoning by taxine, a toxic alkaloid obtained from the yew tree, and that Fortescue ingested it with his breakfast, while a search of his clothing reveals a quantity of rye in his jacket pocket. Rex's wife Adele is the main suspect in the murder. Son Lancelot and his wife Pat are travelling from Kenya to London, at the invitation of his father, according to Lance; at Paris, he wires that he will be home next day, and police meet him at the airport. The day Lance arrives at Yewtree Lodge, leaving his wife in London, Adele dies of cyanide in her tea, and a few hours later the maid Gladys Martin is found strangled in the yard, with a clothes pin put on her nose. Inspector Neele is working full-time with the aid of Sergeant Hay on these murders, interviewing all at the office and in the home. The older son, Percival, tells the Inspector that his father was erratic and ruining the business. After the story of the three murders is in the newspapers, Miss Marple arrives at Yewtree Lodge to shed light on Gladys Martin, who learned serving and cleaning at Miss Marple's home. Miss Ramsbottom, Rex's sister-in-law, invites her to stay. Inspector Neele agrees to work with Miss Marple, seeing what she can add. Neele learns that the taxine was ingested in marmalade, with a new jar put out at breakfast used by Rex alone; that jar had been tossed in the yard and found by police. When Miss Marple and Inspector Neele discuss the case, she asks him if he has asked about blackbirds, having seen the pattern of the old children's rhyme \\"Sing a Song of Sixpence.\\" When he does ask, he learns of dead blackbirds on Rex's desk at home, a pie whose contents were removed and replaced with dead blackbirds, and from Lance, of the Blackbird Mine in east Africa. The Blackbird Mine was found by a Mr MacKenzie and suspected of containing gold. Rex Fortescue investigated the land after investing capital in it, then left MacKenzie there to die, returning alone and owning the land that he felt was of no value. Mrs MacKenzie had subsequently blamed Rex for her husband's death, promising to teach her children to avenge their father. Both the Inspector and Miss Marple suspect that the daughter is in the household under another name, as the son died in the war. The Inspector suspects Mary Dove, the housekeeper, and tells her so; later, Jennifer Fortescue, wife of Percy, tells Miss Marple that she was the MacKenzies' daughter, and the Inspector confirms it. Jennifer put out the dead blackbirds near Rex to remind him of his past offence; Miss Marple realizes this gave the theme to the murderer. Dove immediately blackmails Jennifer; Inspector Neele says if Dove pays the money back, he will not charge her. Miss Marple explains to Inspector Neele who killed Rex Fortescue: Gladys, who put the poison in the marmalade believing it was a truth drug, and the rye in his pocket, at the direction of her boyfriend, Albert Evans. The unattractive Gladys was very easy to persuade to assist him, never questioning his motives and flattered by his attentions. Miss Marple explains that Albert Evans is really Lance Fortescue, who wants the deed to the Blackbird Mine, as uranium has been found there. He arranged the murder of his father to stop the loss of cash and to deal only with his brother. He murdered his stepmother because she would inherit a large amount of money, but only if she lived thirty days after her husband, and he killed Gladys so she would not talk, leaving the clothes pin to match the line in the rhyme. When Miss Marple returns home, a letter from Gladys waylaid in the post awaits her. She explains all she did and begs Miss Marple's help, as she does not know what to do, and encloses a photo of her and her Albert -- clearly Lance Fortescue. Inspector Neele's case will be very strong. Characters * Miss Marple: She trained Gladys in the duties of service in a home or at a restaurant, and feels responsible when she reads of the murders where Gladys works. * Miss Griffith: Head typist at the offices of Rex Fortescue. She calls his doctor. * Miss Irene Grosvenor: Competent, beautiful blonde secretary in the offices of Rex Fortescue, his personal secretary. * Miss Somers: Newest secretary in the office of Rex Fortescue, never able to know when water is boiling for tea. * Inspector Neele: Detective inspector of the CID (Criminal Investigation Division) who handles the death of Rex Fortescue and the following two deaths at the Fortescue home.

He is more conservative in his investments than his father is. He is called either Percy or Val and is about 30 years old.

She no longer speaks with her daughter as she only argues with her daughter. * Donald and Ruby MacKenzie: The two children of the MacKenzies, ages 9 and 7 when their father died. Their mother raised them to avenge their father's death. Donald was killed early in the Second World War. Literary significance and reception Philip John Stead in The Times Literary Supplement, 4 December 1953 wrote that \\"Miss Christie's novel belongs to the comfortable branch of detective fiction; it never harrows its readers by realistic presentation of violence or emotion or by making exorbitant demands on their interest in the characters. Crime is a convention, pursuit an intellectual exercise, and it is as if the murderer of the odious financier did but poison in jest. The characters are lightly and deftly sketched and an antiseptic breeze of humour prevails. It is a pleasure to read an author so nicely conscious of the limitations of what she is attempting.\\" He concluded, \\"Miss Christie has a reputation for playing fair with the reader who likes to assume detective responsibility, and also for being one too many for him. In the present case it may be felt that the hidden mechanism of the plot is ingenious at the expense of probability, but the tale is told with such confidence that (like murder itself, in this pastoral atmosphere) it does not matter very much.\\" Maurice Richardson in The Observer (15 November 1953) posited, \\"Not quite so stunning as some of Mrs Christie's criminal assaults upon her readers; the souffl√© rises all right, but the red herrings aren't quite nifty enough. But how well she nearly always writes, the dear decadent old death-trafficker; they ought to make her a Dame or a D. Litt.\\" Robert Barnard said of the characters that \\"Super-stockbrokerbelt setting, and quite exceptionally nasty family of suspects. (Christie usually prefers to keep most of her characters at least potentially sympathetic as well as potential murderers, but here they are only the latter).\\" He felt that the plot was \\"Something of a re-run of Hercule Poirot's Christmas (loathsome father, goody-goody son, ne'er-do-well son, gold-digger wife, etc.), but without its tight construction and ingenuity. And the rhyme is an irrelevancy.\\" His bottom line on this novel was that \\"Still, a good, sour read.\\" The poison The aril, the fleshy part of the berry, is the only part of the yew that is non-toxic. The seeds inside the berry contain a high concentration of taxine and are poisonous if chewed. Pets that chew on yew branches or leaves have become ill. One of the characters in the novel remarks that Taxine has \\"no medical uses,\\" which was correct at the time. In 1963, Taxol which is a member of the Taxine family, was found to be one of the most potent and effective chemotherapy drugs for the treatment of solid tumours. Film, TV or theatrical adaptations The novel was adapted into the Russian-language film Tayna chyornykh drozdov (The Secret of the Blackbirds) and starred Estonian actress Ita Ever as Miss Marple. A Pocket Full of Rye was the fourth transmitted story in the BBC series of Miss Marple adaptations, which starred Joan Hickson as the elderly sleuth. It was first broadcast in two parts on 7 & 8 March 1985. Despite remaining faithful to the novel, apart from giving the title as \\"A Pocketful of Rye\\", the characters of Mrs MacKenzie, Gerald Wright and Elaine Fortescue did not make an appearance. In the end, the murderer dies in a car crash, while there is no such thing in the novel. The novel was adapted for the fourth series of the British television series Agatha Christie's Marple broadcast on ITV on 6 September 2009, starring Julia McKenzie as the title character. In comparison with the other episodes, this adaptation was surprisingly faithful, having only minor changes.

Joo Koon station is named after Joo Koon Village, a rural Chinese settlement that once stood in the area before it was turned into an industrial estate in the 1960s. It was the western terminus of the East West Line from 28 February 2009 to 18 June 2017, until Tuas Link station was built. Two out of three trains terminate at this station during off-peak hours, alternate trains terminate at this station during peak hours. Joo Koon MRT station at night. History Built along with Pioneer, it was part of the Boon Lay MRT Extension (BLE) project announced by the Land Transport Authority in December 2004 to help people working in the Jurong Industrial Area travel faster. The station opened on 28 February 2009 together with Pioneer. It replaced Boon Lay as the western terminus of the East West Line from its opening until 18 June 2017, when the Tuas West Extension to Tuas Link began operations. As with most of the above-ground stations built in the past along the East West Line, it was built without platform screen doors that prevent commuters from falling onto the train tracks. Installations of the half-height platform screen doors were eventually started on 16 May 2011. On 26 July that year, all of the platform screen doors at the station had been installed and began operations. The station was installed with high-volume low-speed fans, which began operations on 19 August 2012. =Tuas West Extension= On 18 June 2017, Tuas Link station took over Joo Koon station as the western terminus, as part of the opening of the Tuas West Extension. At that time, every other westbound train continued to terminate at this station, and was planned to remain that way until the entire line was upgraded to the new signalling system by the end of 2018. Incidents=November 15 train collision and delay= On 15 November 2017 at approximately 8.18am, 2 C151A trains collided at Joo Koon MRT station. A train fault caused the first train heading in the direction of Tuas Link to stall at the station. A minute later, a second train stopped behind the first and then \\"moved forward unexpectedly\\", resulting in the collision. 36 passengers and 2 SMRT staff sustained light to moderate injuries, and have been conveyed to Ng Teng Fong General Hospital and National University Hospital. This is the second of such incidents after 5 August 1993, with the first being when 2 C151 trains collided at Clementi. As a result, train services between Tuas Link and Boon Lay stations were temporally suspended on both directions for 2 hours on the day itself and for the entire day on 16 November that year, resulting that the westbound trains would terminate at Boon Lay station. An update by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) & SMRT on that day stated that LTA and SMRT have decided to isolate for up to one month for the operations of the Tuas West Extension, which runs on the new signalling system, from the rest of the East West Line, which runs on the old signalling system. This will enable LTA engineers to carry out further assurance checks together with Thales. Train service on the Tuas West Extension between Gul Circle and Tuas Link resumed operations on 20 November that year, using the new signalling system. The rest of the East West Line continues to run on the old signalling system between Pasir Ris and Joo Koon. However, train services between Joo Koon and Gul Circle were suspended till 27 May 2018, and free bridging bus service is available between these two stations. Continuous service to Tuas Link resumed in stages.

The parish is three miles east of Wye and ten miles south of Canterbury, extending to the hill-scape of the Devil's Kneading Trough, on the North Downs Way with views towards Ashford, Romney Marsh and the patchy remnant forest of The Weald (between the Greensand Ridge and South Downs). Amenities Common amenities are a garage and a public house. History Hastingleigh gets its name from the Haestingas, a Jutish tribe that lived in the area. The village was in existence before the Domesday Book and originally lay in the valley by the Church of England church (St. Mary the Virgin) but following the plague, the main settlement was relocated to its current position. The church is made of stone, in the Early English style, and has a tower containing one bell: there is a brass to John Halke, d.1604, and Amia his wife, d.1596: The maternal grandparents of Dr. William Harvey; his mother Joane was born at South Hill, Hastingleigh and married Thomas Harvie of Folkestone, in Hastingleigh Church. The nave and aisle were restored in 1880 and the chancel in 1886: the church affords 200 sittings. 12th-century murals were partially uncovered on the north wall, and south east corner of the church in 1966. Hastingleigh was late in receiving a broadband service, in late 2006. It held most requests status for six months before conversion. Transport The village is reached from west or east. The main route (Churchfield Way) through more populated but larger Wye in the west connects, after a short section then a steep descent outside of the civil parish borders, to Elmsted and then to Canterbury.

It features her Belgian detective Hercule Poirot. The novel is notable for featuring Poirot's efficient secretary, Miss Felicity Lemon, who had previously only appeared in the Poirot short stories. Plot summary An outbreak of apparent kleptomania at a student hostel arouses Hercule Poirot's interest when he sees the bizarre list of stolen and vandalised items. These include a stethoscope, some lightbulbs, some old flannel trousers, a box of chocolates, a slashed rucksack, some boracic powder and a diamond ring later found in a bowl of a soup ‚Äì he congratulates the warden, Mrs Hubbard, on a 'unique and beautiful problem'. Poirot's solution of the petty thefts is unsubtle but effective: once he has threatened to call in the police, Celia Austin quickly confesses to the pettier incidents. She denies, however, the following: stealing Nigel Chapman's green ink and using it to deface Elizabeth Johnston's work; taking the stethoscope, the light bulbs and boracic powder; and cutting up and concealing a rucksack. She committed the lesser thefts to attract the attention of Colin McNabb, a psychology student who then becomes engaged to her. She makes restitution for the crimes and reconciles with her victims. The more important incidents remain unsolved. Celia is discovered dead the following morning from an overdose of morphine. It does not take investigators long to see that her death is murder. Inspector Sharpe solves the mystery of the stolen stethoscope during his interviews with the inhabitants of the hostel. Nigel Chapman admits to having stolen the stethoscope to pose as a doctor and steal some morphine tartrate from the hospital dispensary as part of a bet to acquire three deadly poisons (the other two being digitalin and hyoscine). He claims the poisons were carefully disposed of, but cannot be sure that the morphine was not stolen from him while it was in his possession. Poirot turns his attention to the reappearance of the diamond ring, and confronts Valerie Hobhouse, in whose soup the ring was found. It seems that the diamond had been replaced with a zircon and that only Valerie could place it in the dish of soup; Poirot accuses her of having stolen the diamond. She admits to having done so, saying that she needed the money to pay off gambling debts. She also admits to having planted in Celia Austin's mind the idea of the thefts. Mrs Nicoletis is behaving very nervously. She is killed by drinking poisoned brandy. Poirot focuses his attention now on the cutting up of the rucksack. By careful study of the rucksack's design, he identifies an unusual corrugated base, and suggests to the police that the rucksack is part of an international smuggling operation. The rucksacks were sold to innocent students, and then used to transport drugs and gems. Mrs Nicoletis had been bankrolling the organisation, but was not the brain behind it. When the police visited Hickory Road on an unconnected issue, the murderer had cut up the rucksack to avoid its being found and removed light bulbs to avoid being recognised. Patricia Lane comes to Nigel and admits that she has taken the morphine from the bottle in his drawer and substituted for it bicarbonate of soda. Now the bottle of bicarbonate of soda has been taken from her own drawer. While they are searching for this bottle she mentions that she is intending to write to his father to reconcile the two. Nigel tells her that the reason for his estrangement from his father is that he discovered that his father had poisoned his mother with Medinal, a trade name for barbitone sodium. This is why he changed his name and carries two passports. Nigel goes to Inspector Sharpe and tells him about the missing morphine, but while he is there, Patricia telephones to say that she has discovered something further. By the time that Nigel and Sharpe get to the house, she is dead, killed by a blow to the head. Akibombo comes to Sharpe and says that he had taken Patricia's bicarbonate to ease a stomach complaint; when he took a teaspoonful of the bicarbonate, however, he had stomach pains and later discovered that the white powder was in fact the boracic powder. By the time Patricia had substituted the bicarbonate, the morphine had already been substituted by the stolen boracic powder. Poirot's suspicions about Valerie Hobhouse's role in the smuggling operation are proved correct by a police raid on her beauty shop. The murderer is Nigel Chapman, who was known to have the morphine in his possession. He killed Celia because she knew about his dual identity and also knew that Valerie travelled abroad on a false passport. He killed Mrs Nicoletis because she was sure to give the smuggling operation away under pressure, and killed Patricia because she was likely to draw his father's attention to the recent events, as she was on the verge of writing a letter to him in the hope of reconciling him with his son before his death. When Poirot outlines to Nigel's father's solicitor the case against Nigel, the solicitor provides final proof. Nigel's mother had been poisoned, not by his father, but by Nigel. When the father discovered this ( is a poison slow to act, and the mother told her husband), he forced him to write a confession and left it with his solicitor together with a letter explaining that it should be presented to the authorities in case of any further wrongdoing by Nigel. Valerie placed the call to the police station, which had apparently come from Patricia, to establish an alibi for Nigel who had already bludgeoned Patricia. The green ink was a double-bluff intended to divert suspicion away from him. Valerie is willing to incriminate Nigel fully because Mrs Nicoletis was actually her mother.

This is nevertheless one of her most tenuous links to the original nursery rhyme, consisting of little more than the name of a road. Literary significance and reception Philip John Stead's review in the Times Literary Supplement of 23 December 1955 began: \\"Poirot's return to the happy hunting grounds of detective fiction is something of an event. He is called upon to solve the mystery of a series of apparently trivial thefts at a student's hostel but soon finds himself partnering the police in investigating murder. Mrs. Christie rapidly establishes her favourite atmosphere by her skilful mixture of cheerfulness and suspense.\\" After summarising the plot he concluded, \\"The amount of mischief going on in the hostel imposes some strain on the reader's patience as well as on Poirot's ingenuity; the author has been a little too liberal with the red herrings. Yet the thumb-nail sketches of the characters are as good as ever and in spite of the over-elaborate nature of the puzzle there is plenty of entertainment.\\"The Times Literary Supplement, 23 December 1955 (p. 773) Robert Barnard: \\"A significant falling-off in standards in this mid-'fifties story. A highly perfunctory going-through-the-paces: the rhyme has no meaning within the story; the plot (drugs smuggled in imported haversacks) is unlikely in the extreme; and the attempt to widen the range of character types (Africans, Indians, students of Freud etc.) is far from successful. Evelyn Waugh's diary records that it 'began well' but deteriorated 'a third of the way through into twaddle' ‚Äì a judgment which, unusually for him, erred on the side of charity.\\"Barnard, Robert. A Talent to Deceive ‚Äì an appreciation of Agatha Christie ‚Äì Revised edition (pp. 194‚Äì95). Fontana Books, 1990. References or allusions=References to other works= When the students are attempting to place Hercule Poirot, during Chapter 4, one of them mentions the case retold in Mrs McGinty's Dead (1952). When Poirot comes to lecture to the students about his cases in the same chapter, he retells the story of The Nemean Lion, published in book form in The Labours of Hercules (1947). In chapter 5 Poirot also remembers Count Vera Rossakoff's \\"exotic splendour...even in decay\\", something that he has only observed in The Capture of Cerberus, also from The Labours of Hercules. In Chapter 21, Poirot visits a solicitor by the name of Mr. Endicott to confirm his suspicions of Nigel Chapman. Endicott says to Poirot, \\"...I'm deeply in your debt. You cleared up that nasty Abernethy business for me.\\" This may be a reference to the events in After the Funeral (1953), though Abernethie is mistakenly spelt \\"Abernethy\\" and not \\"Abernethie\\" as it is in After the Funeral. Furthermore, the catalyst to Poirot's direct involvement to the events in After the Funeral is a solicitor named Entwhistle, not Endicott =References to actual history, geography and current science= In Chapter 11, Elizabeth Johnston refers to anti-Communist ‚Äúwitch hunts‚Äù in America. The term was first used in its metaphorical sense in 1938, but its specific connection with McCarthyism dates from the first performance of Arthur Miller's play, The Crucible, in 1953. This implies that the setting of the novel is at most two years before its publication. Film, TV or theatrical adaptations A television adaptation, starring David Suchet as Poirot; Philip Jackson as Inspector Japp; Pauline Moran as Miss Lemon; Damian Lewis as Leonard Bateson; Sarah Badel as Mrs Hubbard; Elinor Morriston as Valerie Hobhouse and Jonathan Firth as Nigel Chapman, was broadcast in 1995 in the series Agatha Christie's Poirot. In common with the rest of the series, the setting is moved back in time from the post-World War II period of Christie's original novel to the 1930s. This results in an anachronism: the American student Sally Finch is said to be on a Fulbright scholarship, though the Fulbright Program was not founded until after the Second World War. This adaptation differed from Christie's novel in that Sharpe is replaced with the recurring character of Inspector Japp, and a number of the students from the novel are left out, most notably Akibombo, Elizabeth Johnston, and Lal, who are students but neither English nor American. Other aspects omitted from the TV adaptation include the red herring of the green ink, the change of the motive for the murder of Celia, the theft of the poison being the only thing taken and the person who takes it (McNabb) and the smuggling involving only diamonds, the inclusion of a Custom and Excise Officer conducting an undercover operation, and the relationship between Valerie and Mrs Nicoletis.

Located on the western bank of the Kallang Basin, Nicoll Highway station took its name from Nicoll Highway, a semi-expressway that directly connects the junctions of Mountbatten Road, Guillemard Road and Sims Way in Kallang with the junctions of Raffles Avenue, Stamford Road and Esplanade Drive in Downtown Core. Landmarks within the vicinity of this station include Golden Mile Complex, The Concourse and Kampong Glam. History An exit to Nicoll Highway MRT station. Platform B of the station. The road was realigned in September 2002 for the construction of the station. As part of the LTA's survey in April 2004 for the Circle line station names, two names were selected - Sultan Gate and Kampong Glam. In the end, Nicoll Highway was selected when it was relocated. On 20th of that month, a section of tunnel being built for the Circle line collapsed, apparently when a retaining wall used in the tunnel's construction gave way. This occurred near what was to become the Nicoll Highway station on the Circle line, not far from the Merdeka Bridge. The accident left a collapse zone 150m wide, 100m long, and 30m deep. Four workers were killed, with three more injured and one body which was never recovered. Consequently, the station site was moved around 100 m south of the initial location. Moreover, the tunnels between Promenade and Stadium were constructed on an alignment that bypassed the collapsed area. The collapse also resulted in the completion of the Circle MRT line Stage 1 being pushed back from 2008 to 2010. Prior to 27 March 2019, Nicoll Highway MRT station was located entirely within Kallang planning area.

It is one of the five Christie novels to have not received an adaptation of any kind, the others being Death Comes as the End, Passenger to Frankfurt, They Came to Baghdad, and Postern of Fate. Plot summary Hilary Craven, a deserted wife and bereaved mother, is planning suicide in a Moroccan hotel, when she is asked by British secret agent Jessop to undertake a dangerous mission as an alternative to taking an overdose of sleeping pills. The task, which she accepts, is to impersonate the wife of Thomas Betterton, a nuclear scientist who has disappeared and may have defected to the Soviet Union. Soon she finds herself in a group of oddly-assorted travellers being transported to the unknown destination of the title. The destination turns out to be a secret scientific research facility disguised as a modern leper colony and medical research center at a remote location in the Atlas Mountains. The scientists are well-treated, but they are not allowed to leave the facility, and they are locked in secret areas deep inside the mountain whenever government officials and other outsiders visit. Hilary Craven successfully passes herself as Betterton's wife Olive, because he is miserable and wants desperately to escape. Hilary discovers that the facility was built by the fabulously wealthy and somewhat villainous Mr Aristides, for financial rather than political ends. He has lured the world's best young scientists to it with various deceptions so that he can later sell their services back to the world's governments and corporations for a huge profit. She falls in love with Andrew Peters, a handsome young American who was in the group with her on their journey to the facility. With the help of clues she has left along the way, Jessop eventually locates and rescues her and the others held there. Peters turns out also to be on a mission, intent on bringing Betterton to justice for the murder of his first wife. Betterton, revealed to also be a scientific fraud who plagiarized his work, is arrested. Hilary no longer wants to die, and she and Peters are free to begin their life together.

LeBlanc, a French investigator Major themes This book explores the 1950s subject of defection to the Soviets, but it also demonstrates how the break-up of Christie's first marriage in the 1920s remained with her. Like her 1934 Mary Westmacott novel Unfinished Portrait, it starts with a youngish woman who has married, had a daughter and whose husband has replaced her with someone else. In both books, a young man displays remarkable perceptiveness in spotting her intention to end her life and defies convention to save her, not only in tackling a stranger on intimate matters but in spending time in the woman's hotel bedroom to talk her out of suicide. In this story he talks her into espionage instead. Literary significance and reception The Times Literary Supplement in its review, written by Philip John Stead, of 19 November 1954, was enthusiastic when it asked, \\"Where do scientists go when they vanish from the ken of the Security Services? A solution to this fascinating problem is propounded in Destination Unknown. While it must be admitted that the secret, when disclosed, smacks rather of The Thousand and One Nights than of modern international rivalry for scientific talents, it may surely be excused on the ground that it provides Mrs. Christie with a story- tellers holiday from the rigours of detective fiction. Readers may regret the absence of the tonic logicalities of crime's unravelling ‚Äì though \\"clues\\" are not altogether missing ‚Äì for the secret service story belongs largely to Adventure, but in their place is the author's obvious pleasure in the wider horizons of the more romantic genre.\\" The review concluded, \\"However much the purist yearns for Poirot or Miss Marple, he can hardly deplore Mrs. Christie's bright, busy excursion into this topical and extravagant sphere.\\"The Times Literary Supplement (pg. 733), 19 November 1954. Maurice Richardson of The Observer of 31 October 1954, said, \\"The thriller is not Agatha Christie's forte; it makes her go all breathless and na√Øve.\\" He concluded, \\"Needs to be read indulgently in a very comfortable railway carriage. She probably had a delicious busman's holiday writing it.\\"The Observer (page 7), 31 October 1954. Robert Barnard wrote, \\"Slightly above-average thriller, with excellent beginning (heroine, whose husband has left her for another woman, and whose small daughter had died, contemplates suicide in strange hotel).

Before the station, the closest MRT stations to the National Stadium were the Kallang and City Hall stations, which were at a considerable distance from the stadium. Additionally, road access to the National Stadium was hampered by traffic jams during major events at the venue. In the planning stages of the Marina Line (MRL), the station was announced to serve the National Stadium as the line goes along Stadium Boulevard. The station then became part of Circle line (CCL) Stage 1 when MRL segment between the Dhoby Ghaut and this station was incorporated into the CCL in 2001. Contract 824 for the construction of Boulevard station and associated tunnels was awarded to Nishimatsu Construction Co Ltd - Lum Chang Building Contractors Pte Ltd Joint Venture in May 2001 a contract sum of approximately S$270 million (US$ million). On 6 February 2002, traffic around the former National Stadium had to be realigned for the construction of the station. To facilitate the construction of the station, Stadium Boulevard was closed from Stadium Drive to Stadium Walk.

Stadium station was designed by an architectural team from WOHA, an architectural firm, led by Wang Mun Summ and Richard Hassell. The station was one of two stations to be commissioned through the Marina Line Architectural Design Competition jointly organized by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and the Singapore Institute of Architects (SIA) in 2000. The station was designed to handle large passenger numbers during major events, featuring an open-air concourse and plaza space to accommodate the crowds and prevent overcrowding within the station. The open-ended station allows it to be linked to future developments around the station at ground level. Initially, it was proposed by the design team to elevate the then- existing Stadium Boulevard and build a public space underneath which will link to the surrounding buildings. However, after analysing possible traffic patterns for the road bridge, the (LTA) recommended scrapping the bridge. As the bridge was a key feature of the design, the team had to redesign the station, but they kept the characteristics of a public plaza, a transparent diagram and basic yet massive elements for the new design. The new design contrasts a straight side against a curved opposite side. According to WOHA, the change is just rotating the old design on its side, with the bridge changed to the curved side and the ground being the straight vertical side. The curve side and the grey colour scheme draws reference to the old National Stadium, which has been demolished to make way for the current Singapore Sports Hub. The station has a grand spacious interior inspired by European train stations built in the 19th century, with the skylight naturally illuminating the platforms to make them visually appealing and eliminating the need to have excessive signage to navigate around. The station exterior was cladded with ribbed aluminium to make the material ambiguous; making them look soft or hard depending on light conditions and time of the day. This station was awarded \\"Design Of The Year\\" of the President's Design Award in 2010, nominated by Patrick Bingham-Hall, an architectural photographer. Bingham- Hall, the nominator, praised the station as a 'brilliantly intuitive piece of architecture (which) defy imitation', while the jurors of the award commented that the station design was 'appropriate' to reflect the importance of the new Sports Hub the station serves. The station also received the 9th SIA Architectural Design Awards for the Industrial, Transport & Infrastructure, the Award for International Architecture by the Australian Institute of Architects and the 2010 International Architecture Award by the Chicago Athenaeum and the European Centre for Architecture Art Design and Urban Studies. It was also one of the finalists for the 2008 World Architecture Festival.

Serving the Mountbatten subzone, the area and the station is named after British Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten, the Supreme Allied Commander of the South East Asia Command who accepted the Japanese surrender of Singapore during the Second World War. Built at the junction of Mountbatten Road, Old Airport Road and Stadium Boulevard, Mountbatten station provides MRT access to residents of the Old Kallang Airport Estate and the numerous sports facilities at Kallang Sports Complex, including Kallang Field, Kallang Tennis Centre and Kallang Netball Centre. Mountbatten station is within walking distances to Stadium MRT station and Dakota MRT station. History On 26 September 2003, construction started at Mountbatten MRT station with road realignment being done at Old Airport Road/Mountbatten Road junction. Before the station was built, it was named Old Airport Road. As there are two stations surrounding the Old Airport Road, it was renamed to Mountbatten. Mountbatten was selected after Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma, the Supreme Allied Commander (Southeast Asia) who accepted the Japanese surrender of Singapore during the Second World War. The station was opened on 17 April 2010 along with the rest of Stage 1 & 2 of the Circle line. The contractor in charge of building this station was Nishimatsu-Lum Chang joint venture, the same joint venture that was in charge of the Nicoll Highway station. Geography The alignment of the underground Kallang‚ÄìPaya Lebar Expressway intersects with the alignment of the railway tunnels of the Circle line between Mountbatten and Stadium. It posed a construction challenge as both were constructed at the same time from 2003 to 2006. The distance between Dakota MRT station and this station is one of the shortest between any two stations on the Circle line, taking less than a minute to travel between the two stations. Both stations are located on Old Airport Road, hence the short distance.

This work was published in the United States at the same time as What Mrs McGillicuddy Saw!, by Dodd, Mead. The novel was published in serial form before the book was released in each nation, and under different titles. The US edition retailed at $2.95. Reviewers at the time generally liked the novel, but would have liked more direct involvement of Miss Marple, and less consideration of her failing strength, using others to act for her. A later review by Barnard found the story short on clues, but favorably noted Lucy Eyelesbarrow as an independent woman character. The 1961 film Murder, She Said was based on this novel as were several television programs. Plot summary Mrs Elspeth McGillicuddy is on her way from a shopping expedition to visit her old friend Jane Marple for Christmas. Her train passes another train running parallel and in the same direction as her train. Then, a blind in one compartment flies up and she sees a man with his back to her strangling a woman. She reports it to a sceptical ticket collector who passes the report for investigation. When arriving at Miss Marple's cottage, she tells all to her. Mrs McGillicuddy describes the dying woman as having blonde hair and wearing a fur coat and the man as tall and dark, though she saw only his back. Miss Marple believes her story, knowing her friend to be trustworthy in description. With no report of a body found in the next day's news, Miss Marple sets out to determine where the body is. With a good map and several rides on the trains to feel the effect of a sharp curve on standing passengers, she determines that the body is on the grounds of Rutherford Hall. Miss Marple sends Lucy Eyelesbarrow, a young professional cook and housekeeper, to work at Rutherford Hall and find the body. Luther Crackenthorpe is a semi-invalid widower who lives in Rutherford Hall with his daughter Emma. Luther's father wrote a will that left his property for his eldest grandson, not liking his son. Luther receives the income for life. After Luther's death, the capital is to be divided equally among Luther's surviving children, not unlike a tontine pension. The share of cash rises to the living children as each sibling dies before their father dies. Edmund, the firstborn son, died during World War II. Youngest daughter Edith (\\"Edie\\"), died four years before the novel begins, leaving a son, Alexander. The remaining children are Cedric, an Ibiza-based bohemian painter; Harold, a married banker; Alfred, who engages in shady business dealings; and Emma. Others at the family home include Alexander's father Bryan Eastley, and Alexander's school friend James Stoddart-West, and local physician Dr Quimper, who looks after Luther but is in love with Emma. Lucy uses golf practice as a way to search the grounds. She discovers fur from a woman's fur coat caught on a bush. Then she finds a cheap compact. Lucy takes these to Miss Marple, who believes the murderer knew all about Rutherford Hall. He removed the body from the embankment where it had fallen away from the railway, drove a car outside the grounds at night and hid the body. Lucy finds the woman's body hidden in a sarcophagus in the old stables containing Luther's collection of dubious antiques. Who was she? The police, led by Inspector Craddock, identify the victim's clothing as purchased in Paris. Emma tells the police of two letters, one from her brother shortly before his death in the retreat to Dunkirk, and another received a few weeks before the woman's body is found. Her brother said he would marry a woman named Martine. The recent letter seemed to be from Martine, wanting to connect with the family of her son's father. There was not a second letter, nor a meeting with Martine. The police conclude that the body in the sarcophagus is that of Martine until Lady Stoddart-West, mother of James, reveals her identity. She confirms that Edmund's letter spoke of her, but he died before they could marry. She spoke up only because her son told her of the letter supposedly from Martine. The whole family, apart from the absent Bryan and Alexander, takes ill suddenly, and Alfred dies. Later, the curry made by Lucy on the fateful day is found to contain arsenic. Some days later, Harold, after returning home to London, receives a delivery of tablets from Dr Quimper, who had told him not to take more, yet sends him more. Harold takes them; poisoned with aconitine, Harold dies whilst being watched taking the tablets by Lady Alice, his wife. Lucy arranges an afternoon-tea visit to Rutherford Hall for Miss Marple and Mrs McGillicuddy. Miss Marple instructs Mrs McGillicuddy to ask to use the lavatory as soon as they arrive. Miss Marple is eating a fish-paste sandwich when she begins to choke on a fish bone. Dr Quimper moves to assist her. Mrs McGillicuddy enters the room at that moment, sees the doctor's hands at Miss Marple's throat, and cries out, \\"But that's him ‚Äì that's the man on the train!\\" Miss Marple realised that her friend would recognise the real murderer if she saw him again in a similar pose. The dead woman was Quimper's wife, who would not divorce him so he killed her to be free to marry Emma. After the Quimpers separated, she joined a ballet troupe as Anna Stravinska. Quimper's scheme grew to killing Emma's brothers, so the inheritance need not be shared. He poisoned the cocktail jug, not the dinner, and added arsenic to the sample of curry he took before he gave it in for testing. He added a second dose of arsenic to Alfred's tea. He sent the poisoned tablets to Harold. Miss Marple then tells Mrs McGillicuddy and Inspector Craddock that Luther Crackenthorpe may die soon, that Emma will get over the doctor, and that there will be wedding bells for Lucy ‚Äì though she refuses to be drawn on the identity of the groom. It is obvious to Miss Marple.

Title The UK title 4.50 from Paddington, specifies a train time departing from Paddington station, a major station in central London. The train is identified by the time it is scheduled to leave that station, at ten minutes before five in the afternoon. In British style, the time is written as 4.50 (nowadays it would be 16.50). The London railway stations were perhaps not considered well known by the US publisher, and thus the title was changed to What Mrs McGillicuddy Saw!, which also refers to that moment on the train, for the US market. Literary significance and reception Philip John Stead's review in The Times Literary Supplement (29 November 1957) concluded that \\"Miss Christie never harrows her readers, being content to intrigue and amuse them.\\" The novel was reviewed in The Times edition of 5 December 1957 when it stated, \\"Mrs Christie's latest is a model detective story; one keeps turning back to verify clues, and not one is irrelevant or unfair.\\" The review concluded, \\"Perhaps there is a corpse or two too many, but there is never a dull moment.\\" Fellow crime writer Anthony Berkeley Cox, writing under the nom de plume of Francis Iles, reviewed the novel in the 6 December 1957 issue of The Guardian, in which he confessed to being disappointed with the work: \\"I have only pity for those poor souls who cannot enjoy the sprightly stories of Agatha Christie; but though sprightliness is not the least of this remarkable writer's qualities, there is another that we look for in her, and that is detection: genuine, steady, logical detection, taking us step by step nearer to the heart of the mystery. Unfortunately it is that quality that is missing in 4.50 from Paddington. The police never seem to find out a single thing, and even Miss Marples (sic) lies low and says nuffin' to the point until the final dramatic exposure. There is the usual small gallery of interesting and perfectly credible characters and nothing could be easier to read. But please, Mrs Christie, a little more of that incomparable detection next time.\\" Robert Barnard said of this novel that it was \\"Another locomotive one ‚Äì murder seen as two trains pass each other in the same direction. Later settles down into a good old family murder. Contains one of Christie's few sympathetic independent women. Miss Marple apparently solves the crime by divine guidance, for there is very little in the way of clues or logical deduction.\\"  Publication history  * 1957, Collins Crime Club (London), 4 November 1957, Hardcover, 256 pp. * 1957, Dodd Mead and Company (New York), November 1957, Hardcover, 192 pp. * 1958, Pocket Books (New York), Paperback, 185 pp. * 1960, Fontana Books (Imprint of HarperCollins), Paperback, 190 pp. * 1965, Ulverscroft Large-print Edition, Hardcover, 391 pp. * 1974, Pan Books, Paperback, 220 pp. * 2006, Marple Facsimile edition (Facsimile of 1962 UK first edition), 3 January 2006, Hardcover, In the UK the novel was first serialised in the weekly magazine John Bull in five abridged instalments from 5 October (volume 102 number 2675) to 2 November 1957 (volume 102 number 2679) with illustrations by KJ Petts.Holdings at the British Library (Newspapers ‚Äì Colindale). Shelfmark: NPL LON LD116. The novel was first serialised in the US in the Chicago Tribune in thirty six instalments from Sunday 27 October to Saturday 7 December 1957 under title Eyewitness to Death. The novel was published in the US under the title What Mrs McGillicuddy Saw! by Dodd Mead and Co. The UK version was to be titled 4.54 from Paddington until the last minute, when the title and text references were changed to 4.50 from Paddington. This change was not communicated to Dodd Mead until after the book was being printed, so the text references to the time show 4:54 rather than 4:50. An abridged version of the novel was also published in the 28 December 1957 issue of the Star Weekly Complete Novel, a Toronto newspaper supplement, under the title Eye Witness to Death with a cover illustration by Maxine McCaffrey. Adaptations=Film in 1961= The book was made into a 1961 movie starring Margaret Rutherford in the first of her four appearances as Miss Marple. It was the first Miss Marple film. =BBC 'Miss Marple' Series 1987= The BBC broadly follows the original plot with its 1987 version, starring Joan Hickson, (who also starred as Mrs Kidder in the 1961 film, Murder, She Said). There are several changes: * The poisoning of the family is absent. * Alfred is still alive at the end, though suffering from a terminal illness that Dr Quimper apparently misdiagnosed deliberately. * Like the 1961 film, Harold is murdered in what appears to be a hunting accident, and not by poisoned tablets, because Dr Quimper suspected Harold knew who the victim was, as Harold had a deep passion for dancing and collected posters of the same ballet troupe she was in. * Anna Stravinka's real name is revealed as \\"Martine Isabelle Perrault\\" (in the novel, her real name is unknown). Thus the twist where James Stoddard-West's mother is Martine is deleted and the real Martine is not seen. * Inspector Craddock is replaced by Inspector Duckham and recurring characters in the television series, Inspector Slack and Sergeant Lake. * At the end, Miss Marple unambiguously opines that Lucy Eyelesbarrow will marry Bryan Eastley. *Cast: **Joan Hickson ‚Äì Miss Marple **Jill Meager ‚Äì Lucy Eyelesbarrow **David Beames ‚Äì Bryan Eastley **Joanna David ‚Äì Emma Crackenthorpe **Maurice Denham ‚Äì Luther Crackenthorpe **John Hallam ‚Äì Cedric Crackenthorpe **Robert East ‚Äì Alfred Crackenthorpe **Bernard Brown ‚Äì Harold Crackenthorpe **Andrew Burt ‚Äì Dr Quimper **David Horovitch ‚Äì Detective Inspector Slack **Mona Bruce ‚Äì Mrs McGillicuddy =ITV Marple Series 2004= ITV adapted the novel for the series Marple in 2004 starring Geraldine McEwan as Miss Marple, with the title What Mrs McGillicuddy Saw! used when it was shown in the US. The adaptation contains several changes from the novel: * Dr Quimper's first name, not mentioned in the novel, is given as David. His character was changed to be more sympathetic than he is in the novel. His motive for murdering his wife is his love for Emma rather than his desire for the Crackenthorpe inheritance. * Only two murders occur ‚Äì Quimper's wife, and Alfred. Harold is still alive at the end. * Both the motive for killing Alfred, and the method of his murder, were changed. Alfred spotted Quimper planting a false clue on the grounds of the Hall, knowing that the body of his wife would be found. When Alexander and James show the clue to the family, Alfred decides to blackmail Quimper, boasting to Lucy just that he is due to receive money. When the family fall ill at dinner by a small dose of arsenic, Alfred is later killed in his bed by a fatal injection from Quimper; as he is being killed, Alfred cries out his killer's name. Quimper makes certain this is misconstrued as him calling for the doctor's help. * In this version, Alfred is the eldest son after Edmund, and will inherit the Hall; Harold is the second-eldest son (He becomes next-in-line to inherit the Hall after Alfred dies) and Cedric is the youngest son. * The name of Luther's father is changed from Josiah to Marcus and he manufactured confectionery rather than tea biscuits. * The novel's Inspector Dermot Craddock is replaced by Inspector Tom Campbell, an old friend of Miss Marple. This adaption ends with Lucy rejecting the two Crackenthorpe men in favour of the inspector. * Bryan is British in the novel, but American in the adaption. * The way Miss Marple reveals Dr Quimper as the murderer was changed; it take place on a train with Mrs McGillcuddy witnessing it from a passing train. When he is exposed, the communication cords on both trains are pulled, before Tom arrests Quimper whilst Mrs McGillcuddy switches to their train. Miss Marple then reveals all in her denouement aboard the train. * Edmund is killed by a U-Boat in the Atlantic in December 1941, rather than dying at Dunkirk in 1940 and considered to be lost at sea. In addition, Edith's cause of death, not given in the novel, is described as having occurred during childbirth. * Anna Stravinska's true name is given as Suzanne Bellaine. Lucy finds the body within a mausoleum on the Hall's grounds, purely by chance, rather than a barn containing antiquities. * In the adaptation, Edmund did marry Martine, and brought her home to meet all his family. The visit is marred by Harold, who sexually assaults her. * In the adaption, Harold Crackenthorpe's wife, Lady Alice, is given a much bigger role than in the novel. In addition to these changes, Miss Marple is seen reading Dashiel Hammett's \\"Woman in the Dark and Other Stories\\", providing an inter-textual detail that suggests some of Miss Marple's detective insights come from her reading of classic murder fiction as well as her shrewd understanding of human nature. *Cast: **Geraldine McEwan ‚Äì Miss Jane Marple **Amanda Holden ‚Äì Lucy Eyelesbarrow **John Hannah ‚Äì Inspector Tom Campbell **Michael Landes ‚Äì Bryan Eastley **Niamh Cusack ‚Äì Emma Crackenthorpe **David Warner ‚Äì Luther Crackenthorpe **Ciar√°n McMenamin ‚Äì Cedric Crackenthorpe **Ben Daniels ‚Äì Alfred Crackenthorpe **Charlie Creed- Miles ‚Äì Harold Crackenthorpe **Rose Keegan ‚Äì Lady Alice Crackenthorpe **Griff Rhys Jones ‚Äì Dr Quimper **Rob Brydon ‚Äì Inspector Awdry **Pam Ferris ‚Äì Mrs Elspeth McGillicuddy **Celia Imrie ‚Äì Madame Joliet **Jenny Agutter ‚Äì Agnes Crackenthorpe =Le crime est notre affaire= Le crime est notre affaire is a French film directed by Pascal Thomas, released in 2008. Named after the book Partners in Crime, and, like the book, starring Tommy and Tuppence as the detective characters, the film is in fact an adaptation of 4.50 From Paddington.

Dialogue interspersed with the hidden object puzzles follows the plot of the original story. Items mentioned in the dialogue are among those hidden in each round. The player finds locations on the map by textual clues, which makes the map a hidden object scene, too. At three points during play the player is asked to hypothesize on the identity of the murderer, but as in the novel there is little in the way of relevant evidence. Unlike the games based on Evil Under the Sun, Murder on the Orient Express, and And Then There Were None, this does not include any actual detection and unlike the latter two does not add an additional character to represent the player. This is the 4th in a series of Oberon Games' hidden object games based on Agatha Christie's novels, the first three were based on Death on the Nile, Peril at End House, and Dead Man's Folly.

It includes the town of La Victoria or Puerto La Victoria, which has a population of around 7,800.  History and Tourism  Founded in 1889 in time of President Patricio Escobar, formerly known as Angel Custodio. It was based on Enterprise Taninera Carlos Casado, which is also called \\"Puerto Casado.\\" Elevated by district in 1973. This was used as a port of transit for Paraguayan troops on their way to fight the Bolivians during the Chaco War. The Carlos Casado Company came to have more than 5,000,000 hectares in the Paraguayan Chaco, today the factory is shut down. It is from here that Mennonites and Paraguayan soldiers passed, using the narrow-gauge trains of the Chaco Central railroad that extended 145 km west from the River Paraguay. In Puerto Casado there are places of historical epoch of the Chaco War, the first Mennonite settlers arrived here in 1920. Galvan Hill is located 5 km south of \\"Kilometro 11,\\" the former railway station that left from Puerto Casado. The boat makes a high Aquidab√°n here, part of Concepcion. Another boat that is here for the \\"Cacique II,\\" which part of Asuncion for Vallem√≠. At Galvan Hill one can still see the old railroad tracks. Here Emiliano R. Fern√°ndez wrote his poem \\"The Fashion\\" in 1926. This is the first railroad station of importance along the railroad. The railway was built by the company for the extraction of timber, with nearly 150 km of narrow gauge track into the heart of the Chaco. The same route of the railway was extended up to 160 km, which enabled the Paraguayan troops in campaign to access the fortresses to stop the advance of Bolivians in this vast territory during the Chaco War. During the Chaco War of the railroad was vital to transport soldiers, arms, ammunition, supplies, vehicles, fuel, medicines and wounded. The old Kilometro 11 station, a former house that was part of the old railway station of the Carlos Casado Company, is one of the historic landmarks still standing in the locality. With the sale of public lands in the late nineteenth century was established company Carlos Casado Ltda., which acquired in 1886 over , was devoted to logging and production of tannin. Tannin is a substance extracted from the \\"quebracho\\" tree, used for tanning hides. The son of the founder, Jos√© Casado, arrived in 1929 to manage the site, lived on site until 1945. During the Chaco War, the facilities were used as workshops for all kinds of machinery, armaments, especially motor vehicles, before being sent into battle. It also was used as river port and military post. In 1931 the Command Infantry Division was installed at the port, Jos√© F√©lix Estigarribia accepted the post of Commander that he proposed the then president Joseph P. Guggiari since late July, 1931 Estigarribia was already installed there. When the new commander settled in the place, the owner of the factory provided him with a house, called \\"La Chaque√±a\\", a large and comfortable residence located in the city centre. Emiliano R. Fernandez, popular poet and musician, often called the \\"northern poet,\\" to 1923 was in Puerto Casado, where he performed several tasks. Often his works are signed as having been written in Alto Paraguay. As for handicrafts, in the early 80's a former worker of the company had the idea of making a guampa (mate cup) for his own use from pieces of the stainless steel that was used to store tannin. The idea was warmly accepted and began to receive orders and the manufacturer improved technology and creating new models of guampa for drinking mate and terere. Today these are manufactured in various designs on special orders for gifts or as souvenirs of Puerto Casado. In the Paraguay and Apa Rivers and in the many streams in the area, an important tourist activity is fishing.  Etymology  Puerto Casado is a company town founded by the Compa√±√≠a Carlos Casado, established in the city of Rosario (Argentina). For many years, quebracho logs were processed into tannin here. In the late 1990s, the company ceased production and the tannin operation was closed down. Climate The climate is tropical, with a maximum of 45 degrees Celsius in summer, and a minimum of 9 degrees Celsius in winter. The average is 25 degrees. We present long drought followed by torrential rains. The climate of Puerto Casado can be classified as tropical savannah climate (Aw).  Geography  The terrain is a plain that does not exceed 300 meters above sea level. There are sporadic and undulations of fertile land, used for agriculture and animal husbandry.  Demography  La Victoria has a total of 6,489 inhabitants, of whom 3304 are men and 3185 women, according to estimates by the Directorate General of Statistics, Census and Surveys.

One of the largest companies in the country was the company Carlos Casado, former factory tannin, about the company looks at the homes of former employees and owners, as well as the old Hotel de Puerto Casado.  Pilgrimage \\"√ëanda Yvyrek√°vo\\"  In search of our land,Guarani', with whom he traveled nearly 600 km from Puerto Casado to Asuncion, 156 km for six days on foot and the rest by truck.

It is underneath Bras Basah Road, bordering Waterloo Street and Queen Street. Located next to the Singapore Management University (SMU), this station is in close proximity to Bencoolen station on the Downtown line (DTL), even though they are not directly connected as an interchange. The station is also within walking distance to the National Museum of Singapore, the Singapore Art Museum, Peranakan Museum and the School of the Arts. Initially announced as part of the Marina MRT line, it was later incorporated into the CCL Stage 1. Along with the other stations on Stages 1 and 2 of the CCL, the station started operations on 17 April 2010. The design of the station by WOHA was commissioned through the Marina line Architectural Design Competition and was awarded the \\"Best Transport Building\\" in 2009 at the World Architecture Festival. History Exit A of Bras Basah station Contract 825 for the design and construction of Bras Basah station and associated tunnels was awarded to Shanghai Tunnel Engineering Co. (Singapore) Pte Ltd and a joint venture with Woh Hup and NCC at a sum of S$343.94 million (US$ million) on 19 December 2001. The contract also included the construction of the Dhoby Ghaut, Esplanade and Promenade stations. To facilitate the construction, on 10 June 2002, part of Bras Basah Road had to be temporarily realigned. On 15 March 2003, the junctions of Queen Street/Bras Basah Road and Waterloo Street/Bras Basah Road were temporarily closed and the service road adjacent to Oxford Hotel was converted into one-way road in the direction from Queen Street to Waterloo Street. In 2007, the diverted roads have been reinstated as the station undergoes architectural, electrical and mechanical works. On 17April2010, the station opened as part of Stages 1 and 2 of the CCL. Station details=Etymology= The name Bras Basah (Modern Spelling: Beras Basah) means \\"wet rice\\" in Malay ‚Äì beras means harvested rice with husk removed, and basah means wet. Before the station was built, it was named Museum. Later on in 2005, it was renamed to Bras Basah, as the name is well- known and reflects the area's heritage. =Services= The station serves the Circle line, situated between the Dhoby Ghaut and Esplanade stations. The station code is CC2 on official maps. The station operates daily between 5:39am (6:06am on Sundays and Public Holidays) and 12:03am. Train frequencies varies from 5 to 7 minutes depending on peak hours. =Architecture= The station platforms at below ground The station is below ground and was the deepest station when it first opened until the completion of the DTL platforms at Promenade station, which has a depth of . The station was constructed deep underground as the line has to cross underneath the East West Line beneath Victoria Street to reach the station. It is also the station with the longest escalator in the MRT network at , stretching from the ticket concourse to the transfer level and takes approximately one minute to travel. The station design by WOHA resolves two conditions needed for the station: allowing a visual connection to the exterior to enhance the travel experience for the commuters, and enabling the station to blend into the landscape in the historic district and park location. A reflection pool, which also acts as the station roof, allows skylight to enter the station, and functions as a landscape element on the surface. With skylight entering the station, minimal artificial light is required for the station during the day. The natural light improves way-finding and safety for the commuters. The ventilation shafts of the station blends into the landscape, avoiding obstruction of the view across the site to the surrounding civic buildings. The station design was commissioned through the Marina line Architectural Design Competition jointly organised by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and the Singapore Institute of Architects (SIA). At the 2001 SIA Awards, the SIA awarded LTA the prize for ‚ÄòExcellence in Architectural Design Competitions‚Äô. In 2009, the station was awarded the \\"Best Transport Building\\" at the World Architecture Festival, on the basis that the design gives \\"precedence to the surrounding, historically important, colonial structures, creating a piazza-like urban space to the station underneath\\" and noted the design's functionality to allow natural light into the station. The station later won the Award for International Architecture at the AIA's (American Institute of Architects) 2010 National Architecture Awards. In addition, it won the Chicago Athenaeum and the European Centre for Architecture Art Design and Urban Studies and International Architecture Awards in 2011. =Public artwork= A video work The Amazing Neverending Underwater Adventures! by Tan Kai Syng is displayed at the station, commissioned as part of the MRT network's Art-in-Transit programme.

He played guitar in British rock band Mot√∂rhead from 1984 to 1995,Michael 'W√ºrzel' Burston obituary  Music. The Guardian. Retrieved on 2011-07-23. playing on six studio albums and two live albums. W√ºrzel died at the age of 61, following heart complications. Biography Before joining Mot√∂rhead in 1984, W√ºrzel had been a corporal in the British Army, serving in Germany and Northern Ireland with the 1st Battalion of the Gloucestershire Regiment, and had played in the bands Bastard and Warfare. In the early 1980s, W√ºrzel played in a Cheltenham-based band, originally named Made in England, then The Meek. He joined another relatively unknown guitarist, Phil Campbell, at a Mot√∂rhead audition; both were hired. The new four-piece line-up made its debut recording a backing track for The Young Ones on 14 February 1984. W√ºrzel also played on the Lemmy-produced album for Warfare entitled Metal Anarchy in 1985. He acquired the nickname 'W√ºrzel' whilst in the Army, being compared to the character Worzel Gummidge owing to his scarecrow-style hair and bumpkin- like manner. Mot√∂rhead singer Lemmy encouraged W√ºrzel to add an umlaut to the 'U' in his nickname, for heavy metal effect. W√ºrzel saw a number of changes to the band's line-up, each involving the drummer, until he left in 1995. Although he played on the album Sacrifice, he left Mot√∂rhead before the tour. Instead of replacing W√ºrzel, the band reverted to a three-piece line-up. He later made a few guest appearances with them, at the 2008 Download Festival and at the 2009 Guilfest, as well as a few other appearances on the band's 2008 UK tour. W√ºrzel recorded his first solo EP, Bess, in 1987; it was not far removed from the Mot√∂rhead sound, but also allowed for slightly different ideas. The EP included the instrumental title track, two rock pieces, \\"Midnight in London\\" and \\"People Say I'm Crazy\\", and an instrumental jazz rock-oriented track, \\"E.S.P.\\". In 1998, inspired by psychedelically-informed experiences in Belgium, W√ºrzel recorded and released an ambient, improvised avant-garde album entitled Chill Out or Die. Death On 9 July 2011, Tim Butcher, longtime bass technician of Mot√∂rhead leader Lemmy, reported that W√ºrzel had died. The cause of death was ventricular fibrillation triggered by cardiomyopathy.Former MOT√ñRHEAD Guitarist W√úRZEL Reportedly Dies At 61 ‚Äì 9 July 2011 . Roadrunnerrecords.com.

Located at the junction of Bras Basah Road, Raffles Boulevard and Nicoll Highway, the station is in close proximity to the JW Marriott Hotel (Singapore), South Beach Towers, War Memorial Park, Suntec City Mall and the Suntec Singapore Convention and Exhibition Centre. Esplanade station is linked to City Hall MRT station via CityLink Mall or Raffles City. History Completed entrance of Esplanade MRT station in 2008 The underpass from One Raffles Link to War Memorial Park was closed on 24 April 2002. On 9 August that year, the section from Bras Basah Road to Nicoll Highway was realigned. The underpass linking CityLink Mall and Suntec City Mall had been closed on 15 January 2003 to facilitate the construction of the station and pedestrians had to use a temporary covered overhead bridge to cross Raffles Boulevard. On 24 October that year, the Bras Basah Road and Nicoll Highway was realigned to the former NCO Officers Club, and the Beach Road Camp, one of the central army camps in Singapore that was closed in 2000, for the construction of Esplanade MRT station. It was tentatively named Convention Centre until January 2005. In April 2004, 'Esplanade' and 'Suntec' was chosen for their stations. In the end it was renamed to Esplanade to reflect its heritage with the War Memorial Park, Esplanade Park and The Esplanade. On 30 April 2008, the underpass was reopened to the public after five years of closure. It's also the first of the Circle line stations where the public can have a glimpse of the interior. The station had almost completed in August 2007. During the opening of the underpass, Suntec City Mall gave away free coffee, chocolates and sweets to pedestrians to mark the reopening of the underpass. There were also music and line dancing performances. The bridge underwent dismantlement on 12 May 2008. Art-in- Transit An artwork by the late Lim Mu Hue, titled A Piece of Ice-Clear Heart, is located on a large wall within the walkway within the station between Raffles City and Marina Square. This black and white artwork features shadow puppetry and other performances enjoyed by the early settlers of Singapore. Consisting of a set of seven pieces of wood block prints depicting various aspects of theatre, the artwork is a collage of early and later works by Lim Mu Hue who died soon after completing this commission.

In 1962 it acquired the territory of the British Northern Cameroons, which voted to become a province within Northern Nigeria. In 1967, Northern Nigeria was divided into the North-Eastern State, North-Western State, Kano State, Kaduna State, Kwara State, and the Benue-Plateau State, each with its own Governor. History=Prehistory= Area of the Nok culture The Nok culture, an ancient culture dominated most of what is now Northern Nigeria in prehistoric times, its legacy in the form of terracotta statues and megaliths have been discovered in Sokoto, Kano, Birinin Kudu, Nok and Zaria. The Kwatarkwashi culture, a variant of the Nok culture centred mostly around Zamfara in Sokoto Province is thought by some to be the same or an offshoot of the Nok. =The Fourteen Kingdoms= The Fourteen Kingdoms unified the diverse lore and heritage of Northern Nigeria into a cohesive ethno-historical system. Seven of these Kingdoms developed from the Kabara legacy of the Hausa people. In the 9th century as vibrant trading centers competing with Kanem-Bornu and Mali slowly developed in the Central Sudan, a collection of Kingdoms merged dominating the great savannah plains of Hausaland, their primary exports were leather, gold, cloth, salt, kola nuts, animal hides, and henna. The Seven Hausa states included: * Daura, ? - 1806 * Kano, 998 - 1807 * Katsina, c. 1400 - 1805 * Zazzau (Zaria), c. 1200 - 1808 * Gobir, ? - 1808 * Rano * Biram, c. 1100 - 1805 The growth and conquest of the Hausa Bakwai resulted in the founding of additional states with rulers tracing their lineage to a concubine of the Hausa founding father, Bayajidda. Thus they are called the Banza Bakwai, meaning Bastard Seven. The Banza Bakwai adopted many of the customs and institutions of the Hausa Bakwai but were considered unsanctioned or copy-cat kingdoms by non-Hausa people. These states include: * Zamfara * Kebbi * Yauri (also called Yawuri) * Gwari (also called Gwariland) * Kwararafa (a Jukun state) * Nupe (of the Nupe people) * Ilorin (a Yoruba city) =Hausa States= Between 500 CE and 700 CE Hausa people, who are thought to have slowly moved from Nubia and mixing in with the local Northern and Middle Belt population, established a number of strong states in what is now Northern Nigeria and Eastern Niger. With the decline of the Nok and Sokoto, who had previously controlled Central and Northern Nigeria between 800 BCE and 200 CE, the Hausa were able to emerge as the new power in the region. They are closely linked with the Kanuri people of Kanem-Bornu (Lake Chad), the Birom, Gwari, Nupe and Jukun. The Hausa aristocracy, under influence from the Mali Empire adopted Islam in the 11th century CE. By the 12th century CE the Hausa were becoming one of Africa's major powers. The architecture of the Hausa is perhaps one of the least known but most beautiful of the medieval age. Many of their early mosques and palaces are bright and colourful and often include intricate engraving or elaborate symbols designed into the facade. By 1500 CE the Hausa utilized a modified Arabic script known as Ajami to record their own language; the Hausa compiled several written histories, the most popular being the Kano Chronicle.\\"Kano Chronicle,\\" ed. Palmer, pp. 70-72. =Fulani Empire and Bornu Empire= Usuman dan Fodio ,The 18th century revolutionary and a social, religious and political reformer finally united the 7 Hausa States with newly created provinces into the Sokoto Caliphate. The Sokoto Caliphate was under the overall authority of the Commander of the Faithful. Under Dan Fodio, the Empire was bicephalous and divided into two territories each controlled by an appointed vizier. Each of the territories was further divided into autonomous Emirates under mainly hereditary local Emirs. The Bornu Empire was initially absorbed into the Sokoto Caliphate of Usman dan Fodio, but broke away a few years later. =Colonisation= Initially, the British involvement in Northern Nigeria was predominantly trade-related, and revolved around the expansion of the Royal Niger Company, whose interior territories spread north from about where the Niger River and Benue River joined at Lokoja the Mount Patti hill. The Royal Niger Company's territory did not represent a direct threat to much the Sokoto Caliphate or the numerous states of Northern Nigeria. This changed, when Frederick Lugard and Taubman Goldie laid down an ambitious plan to pacify the Niger interior and unite it with the rest of the British Empire. History of the Protectorate of Northern Nigeria Map of Nigeria, 1909 The protectorate of Northern Nigeria was proclaimed at Ida by Frederick Lugard on January 1, 1897. The basis of the protectorate was the 1885 Treaty of Berlin which broadly granted Northern Nigeria to the British sphere of influence, on the basis of their existing protectorates in Southern Nigeria. Hostilities with the powerful Sokoto Caliphate soon followed. the Emirates of Kotogora and Ilorin were the first to be conquered by the British. In February 1903, the great fort of Kano, seat of the Kano Emirate was captured, Sokoto and much of the rest of its Caliphate soon capitulated. On March 13, 1903, the Grand Shura of Caliphate finally conceded to Lugard's demands and proclaimed Queen Victoria as suzerain of the Caliphate and all its lands. Governor Lugard, with limited resources, controlled the region with the consent of local rulers through a policy of indirect rule, which he developed into a sophisticated political theory. The geographical area included in the Northern Nigeria Protectorate included the Okun-Yoruba land of Kabba, Ogidi, Ijumu, Gbede, Yagba, as well as, Ebira land, Igala land fashioned collectively under Kabba Province. The Ifelodun, Offa, Omuaran, Ifelodun and Irepodun areas, also Yorubas, were fashioned into Ilorin province. Lugard left the protectorate after some years, serving in Hong Kong, but was eventually returned to work in Nigeria, where in 1914 he sought the merger of the Northern Nigeria Protectorate with Southern Nigeria, creating the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria. Agitation for independence from the radically different Southern Protectorate, however, led to a formidable split in the 1940s. The Richards constitution proclaimed in 1945, gave overwhelming autonomy to the North, including eventually in the areas of foreign relations and customs policy. =Independence= Northern Nigeria gained self-government on 15 March 1957 with Sir Ahmadu Bello as its first premier. the Northern Peoples Congress under Bello dominated parliament while the Northern Elements Progressive Union became the main opposition party. In 1967, Northern Nigeria was disestablished by subdivision. Government and politics The government of Northern Nigeria was modelled after the Westminster system. A premier actee as head of government and presided over the day-to-day affairs of government, while a Governor of Northern Nigeria acted as viceroy and as commander-in-chief of the constabulary. The lower house of parliament, called the House of Assembly was composed of elected representatives from the various provinces of the country. The Upper House of parliament, called the House of Chefs, was similar to the British House of Lords, composed of unelected emirs of the various Native Authority Councils of the nation's provinces. In 1967, the Federal Military Government of General Yakubu Gowon broke up the four regions that until then had constituted the Federation of Nigeria, creating twelve new states. Northern Nigeria was divided into the North-Eastern State, North-Western State, Kano State, Kaduna State, Kwara State, and the Benue-Plateau State, each with its own Governor and government. =Governor= The High Commissioner or Governor of Northern Nigeria, originally the High Commissioner of the Northern Nigeria Protectorate, after 1914 the Lieutenant Governor, Chief Commissioner, or Governor-General of the Northern Provinces of Nigeria, was effectively the viceroy of Northern Nigeria, exercising British suzerainty as representative of the Crown. The office of High Commissioner was first established on 1 January 1897, by letters patent from Queen Victoria. After the departure of the British in 1960, a Governor continued to be appointed until 1967 as representative of the new administration in Lagos. The governor presided over all ceremonial functions and appointed the members of the nation's upper legislative house, the Northern Nigerian House of Chiefs. =President of the House of Chiefs= *Alhaji Haruna', CMG, Emir of Gwandu =Speakers of the House of Assembly= * Richard Dohew, 1954 - ? * Alhajia' Umarure Gwandupe Geography The highest point in Northern Nigeria is Chappal Waddi at 2,419 m (7,936 ft). The main rivers are the Niger and the Benue River which converge at Kabba province from where it travels southwards ultimately emptying into the Atlantic Ocean. The expansive valleys of the Niger and Benue River valleys dominate the southern areas of the region. To the southeast of the Benue river, hills and mountains which forms the Mambilla Plateau create the highest plateau in Northern Nigeria. This plateau extends to the border with Cameroon, this montane land forms part of the Bamenda Highlands in Cameroon. The great savannah belt of the Great Plains of Hausaland dominates much of the rest of the province. this region experiences rainfall between 20 and 60 inches (508 and 1,524 mm) per year. The savannah zone's three categories are Guinean forest-savanna mosaic, Sudan savannah, and Sahel savannah. Guinean forest-savanna mosaic is plains of tall grass which are interrupted by trees. Sudan savannah is similar but with shorter grasses and shorter trees. Sahel savannah consists of patches of grass and sand, found in the northeast. In the Sahel region, rain is less than 20 inches (508 mm) per year and the Sahara Desert is encroaching. In the dry north-east corner of the country lies Lake Chad, which Northern Nigeria shares with Niger, Chad and Cameroon. The South Western part of the region included Ogidi, Iyamoye, Iyara that have deep forests inter spacing the guinea savannah areas (and borders the forested areas of southern protectorate and as such shared similar rain patterns and given to the cultivation of cash crops such as coffee and cocoa). Subdivisions Northern Nigeria was divided into Thirteen provinces: * Bauchi * Benue * Borno * Kano * Katsina * Plateau * Sardauna * Niger * Adamawa * Zaria * Sokoto * Kabba * Ilorin Kano, the largest of the provinces in terms of population and economy, is in the North-Central part of the country. The Kano Native Authority, an offshoot of the fula Kano Emirate, inherited the ancient trade industries that fuelled the trans-Saharan trade with North Africa. The Province of Zaria is home to the City of Kaduna, an autonomous capital city that serves as the nation's capital and home to its national institutions. Economy Groundnut and cotton industries in the province of Kano provided the main source of revenue for Northern Nigeria. Tin mining in the Province of Plateau, Steel mining in the Province of Benue, and other metal industries in the Province of Sokoto, built up the diverse mining industry of the region. Cement industries in Sokoto and Bauchi and leather processing industries in Kano constituted the main manufacturing sector. Demographics Northern Nigeria though an ethnically and religiously diverse region, is an overwhelmingly majority Muslim region. The Hausa and Fulani dominate much of the North Western and eastern part of the Country. The Hausa , Fulani are chiefly Muslims. A small part of the Hausa population also adheres to the ancient religion of Hausa Animism. The Nupes and the Kanuri are also chiefly Muslims . Small Christian populations also exist in the north, They were converted to Christianity after the colonisation of the country by the British. Human rights concerns Attacks by Fulani tribesman on pastoral villages have resulted in the deaths of 6000 since 2015, according to the Barnabas Fund. Fulani tribesmen have also had to endure merciless killings of them and their livestocks by christian farmers, they are aggressors on both side of this conflicts.

It is located on the Rio Minho river (Jamaica's longest), and is a major market centre for the Parish. The population was 61,548 at the 2011 census increasing from 59,550 in 2001, including the surrounding suburbs of Sandy Bay, Mineral Heights, Hazard, Palmers Cross, Denbigh, Race Track, and Four Paths among others. The town has a mayor. Description Railway Train at May Pen Station May Pen was established as a plantation settlement by the British between 1660 and 1683 on a crossing point of the Rio Minho river. It became part of an estate named after its owner; Reverend William May who was born in England in 1695 but in his later years resided in Jamaica. He was rector of the Kingston Parish Church but was later transferred to Clarendon, where he served for 32 years. May Pen is well located from an administrative point of view in the centre of a largely agricultural parish, and as a midpoint on the Kingston to Manchester road. Boasting a large open air market and transportation centre along Main Street and Sevens Road, the town's centre is often chaotic with activities of shoppers, vendors daily and motorized traffic. May Pen also has many banks, hardware stores, pharmacies and eateries. The town also has a large post office, headquarters for local government, and court house. The clock tower in the town centre was erected in 1908 after the death of a doctor Robert Glaister Samuel Bell who drowned while attempting to cross the Rio Minho river in 1904. As well as having a memorial plaque to Bell, it has another dedicated to World War I (1914-1918). The first bridge over the Rio Minho was built by 1874 for the local railway company,http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/columns/Clarendon-and-tourism--an- underexplored-opportunity_15427781 and rebuilt in the 1920s, it was demolished in 1950 after floods and rebuilt downstream.https://newspaperarchive.com/kingston-gleaner-jun-29-1950-p-13/ May Pen is also an important citrus packing centre, including oranges and a hybrid citrus fruit called an ugli. The Denbigh Agricultural Showground is located approximately three miles west of the centre of the town. May Pen's geographical position is situated near the centre of the entire island. May Pen has long been viewed as one of Jamaica's most important agriculture towns. During its heyday of Jamaican bauxite mining, citrus and sugar production, Clarendon was among Jamaica's leading parishes in terms of economic activity. With the now defunct Jamaica Railway Corporation, May Pen then served as the crossroads of Jamaica natural resources, connecting Frankfield and its citrus plantations in the north of the parish, with Lionel Town and its sugar production in the South. The Alcoa mining and refinery in partnership with the Jamaican government (Jamalco), located south of the town, is the single largest employer of the town, along with the Trout Hall citrus business. The Denbigh Agricultural Show Ground is the largest in the English-speaking Caribbean, and has served to promote regional farmers agriculture, textile and livestock production. Held annually during Jamaica's Independence Celebration weekend, Denbigh often attracted large crowds from all parts of the island to see Jamaica's best in agricultural output, and enjoy festive activities. While May Pen has no universities, it does have several public and private schools, including Central High School, Denbigh High School, Glenmuir High School (Anglican), Glenmuir Preparatory School (Anglican primary), May Pen High School (Adventist private), May Pen Primary School, Foundation Preparatory School, and St. Thomas Moore Preparatory School (Catholic primary).

The concepts strongly influenced the construction of national accounts in the Soviet Union and other Soviet-type societies (see Material Product System). Classical political economy The classical political economists, such as Adam Smith and David Ricardo, raised the economic question of which kinds of labour contributed to increasing society's wealth, as against activities which do not increase wealth. In the introduction to The Wealth of Nations, Smith spoke of the \\"annual labour\\" and \\"the necessaries and conveniences\\" a nation \\"annually consumes\\" before explaining that one of the two steps to increase wealth is reducing the amount of \\"unproductive labour\\". \\"Annual\\" and \\"annually\\" refer to a cyclical reproduction process; \\"unproductive labour\\" are commodities and services which are not inputs to the next economic circle and are therefore lost to economic growth. In contrast, theories with no such time horizon tend to understand Smith's unproductive labour as referring to services, and productive labour as meaning vendible goods.Samuelson, P., 2000, \\"A Revisionist findings on Sraffa\\", pp. 25-44 in: Heinz Kurz, Critical Essays on Piero Sraffa‚Äôs Legacy in Economics, Cambridge University Press, p. 27. Smith‚Äôs distinction between productive and unproductive labour corresponds to Sraffa‚Äôs (1960) distinction of basic and non-basic goods, as basic goods re-enter the productive process, whereas non-basic goods are destined for consumption, with no value for reproduction.Sraffa, P., 1960, Production of Commodities by Means of Commodities, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, p. 8. As Edwin Cannan observes,Cannan, Edwin (ed.), 1937, p. 1 note, Adam Smith, An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, N.Y.: Random House. Smith‚Äôs view of annual reproduction and as a consequence the distinction of productive and unproductive labour stems from his meeting, and the influence of, the French economists known as the Physiocrats. Before his visit to France in his Theory of Moral Sentiments Adam Smith sees the gluttony of the landlords as an \\"invisible hand\\" which helps the poor to partake in the landlords wealth. In The Wealth of Nations it is seen as the consumption of unproductive labour, limiting the growth of wealth. Smith's view that human labour ‚Äì but not unproductive labour ‚Äì is the source of wealth reflects the classical position that all commodities can be reduced to actual labour and produced inputs which in turn resolve into labour and former inputs. Within an enterprise, for example, there were many tasks which had to be performed, such as cleaning, record keeping and bookkeeping, and repairs, which did not directly contribute to producing and increasing wealth in the sense of making a net addition to it ‚Äì in other words, such tasks represented a net cost to the enterprise which had to be minimized. There were also whole occupations such as domestic servants, soldiers, schoolteachers, etc. which, although necessary, did not seem \\"productive\\" in the sense of increasing the material wealth of a society. Part of the population consumed wealth but did not create it. To maximize economic growth, therefore, \\"unproductive costs\\" which consumed part of the total national income rather than adding to it should be \\"minimized; productive labour had to be maximized. Many different economic and moral arguments were made to either justify or else criticise the incomes gained from different activities, on the ground that they were \\"productive\\" or \\"unproductive\\", \\"earned\\" or \\"unearned\\", \\"wealth-creating\\" or \\"wealth- consuming\\". A quote from Adam SmithNeoclassical economics In neoclassical economics, the distinction between productive and unproductive labour was however rejected as being largely arbitrary and irrelevant. All the factors of production (land, labour and capital) create wealth and add value; they are all \\"productive\\". If the value of a good is just what somebody is prepared to pay for it (or its marginal utility), then regarding some activities as value-creating and others not is a purely subjective matter; any activity which produces anything, or generates an income, could be considered production and productive, and the only question that remains is how productive it is. This could be measured by striking a ratio between the monetary value of output produced, and the number of hours worked to produce it (or the number of workers who produce it). This is called a \\"output/labour ratio\\". The ratio \\"GDP per capita\\" is also used by some as an indicator of how productive a population is. However, in calculating any output value, some concept of value is nevertheless required, because we cannot relate, group and aggregate prices (real or notional) at all without using a valuation principle. All accounting assumes a value theory, in this sense - we always need to distinguish conceptually the definition of value equivalence, comparable value, value transfer, loss of value, conservation of value and newly created value. For this purpose, a knowledge of prices is ultimately not sufficient, since the decision to group and categorize prices in a certain way involves criteria and valuations which themselves cannot be derived from prices. A persisting management preoccupation, particularly in large corporations, also concerns the question of which activities of a business are value adding. The reason is simply that value-adding activities boost gross income and profit margins (note that the \\"value-added\\" concept is a measure of the net output, or gross income, after deduction of materials costs from the total sales volume). If the aim is to realise maximum shareholder value, two important valuation problems occur. Firstly, productive assets being used in production have no actual market price, being withdrawn from the market and not offered for sale. They have at best an historic cost, but this cost does not apply to inventories of new output produced. The current value of productive assets can therefore be estimated only according to a probable price that they would have, if they were sold, or if they were replaced. Secondly, there is the problem of what exactly the increases or decreases in the value of productive assets being held can be attributed to. In what has become popularly known as \\"value-based management\\", these problems are pragmatically tackled with the accounting concepts of market-value added (MVA) and economic value-added (EVA). This style of management focuses very closely on how assets and activities contribute to maximum profit income. National accounts In national accounts and social accounting theory the concepts of productive and unproductive labour do survive to some extent. * The first reason is that if we want to estimate and account for the value of the net new output created by a country in a year, we must be able to distinguish between sources of new value added and conserved or transferred value. In other words, we need a value-theoretic principle which guides us in relating, grouping and computing price-aggregates. It is obvious that if products or incomes are merely exchanged or transferred between A and B, then the total product value, or total income, does not increase; all that has happened here is, that they have been shifted around, and redistributed. Total wealth has not increased, no new value was added. By implication, some activities add new value, others do not. * Secondly, it is necessary to create an operational statistical coverage of production itself, which can be used to allocate incomes, activities and transactions in the economy as either belonging to \\"production\\", or falling outside \\"production\\". Thus, some work produces something in the economic sense, other work does not. In general, national accounts adopt a very wide definition of production; it is defined as any activity of resident \\"institutional units\\" (enterprises, public services, households) combining the factors of production (land, labour and capital) to transform inputs into outputs. This includes both market production as well as non-market production, if it recognisably generates an income. The advantage of the wide definition is, that practically all flows of production-related income can be captured (but at the same time a large amount of unpaid work -housework and voluntary work - is not accounted for). Nevertheless, some incomes are ruled out of production and regarded as transfers of wealth. A transfer is defined basically as a payment made or income received without providing any good, service or asset in return, for example: government benefits. Some forms of interest on loans, some property rents, and most capital gains on financial assets and property are also excluded, they are effectively transfers (flows of income and expenditure which are regarded as unrelated to production and to the value of new output) or intermediate expenditure. * Thirdly, national accounts will show the contribution of different economic sectors to the total national product or national income. These sectors are mainly output-defined (e.g. agriculture, manufacturing, business services, government administration). It is therefore possible to distinguish to some extent between \\"productive\\" activities producing some tangible product or service, and other commercial or government activities which do not (yet generate incomes). A large amount of work done in society is not captured in national accounts, because it is unpaid voluntary labour or unpaid household labour. The monetary value of this work can be estimated only from time use surveys. Thus, national accounting definitions of \\"production\\" are strongly biased towards activities which yield a money-income. Marx's critique Karl Marx regarded land and labour as the source of all wealth, and distinguished between material wealth and human wealth. Human wealth was a wealth in social relations, and the expansion of market trade created ever more of those. However, wealth and economic value were not the same thing in his view; value was a purely social category, a social attribution. Both in Das Kapital and in Theories of Surplus-Value, Marx devoted a considerable amount of attention to the concept of \\"productive and unproductive labour\\". He sought to establish what economic and commercial ideas about productive labour would mean for the lives of the working class, and he wanted to criticise apologetic ideas about the \\"productive\\" nature of particular activities. This was part of an argument about the source of surplus value in unpaid surplus labour. His view can be summarised in the following 10 points. * work is not \\"naturally productive\\", both in the sense that it takes work to make work productive, and that productive work depends on tools and techniques to be productive. * generally speaking, a worker is economically productive and a source of additional wealth to the extent that they can produce more than is required for their own subsistence (i.e., is capable of performing surplus- labour) and adding to a surplus product. * the definition of productive and unproductive labour is specific to each specific type of society (for example, feudal society, capitalist society, socialist society etc.) and depends on the given relations of production. * there exists no neutral definition of productive and unproductive labour; what is productive from the point of view of one social class may not be productive from the point of view of another. * the only objective definition of productive labour is in terms of what is as a matter of fact productive within the conditions of a given mode of production. * from the point of view of the capitalist class, labour is productive, if it increases the value of (private) capital or results in (private) capital accumulation. * Capitalistically productive labour is therefore labour which adds to the mass of surplus value, primarily through profitably producing goods and services for market sale. * no new value is created through acts of exchange only; therefore, although labour which just facilitates exchange is \\"productive\\" from the employer's point of view (because they derive profit from it), it is unproductive from the social point of view because it accomplishes only a transfer of wealth. This \\"unproductive\\" labour is accepted however because it reduces the costs of capital accumulation, or facilitates it, or secures it. * the definition of productive and unproductive labour is not static, but evolving; in the course of capitalist development, the division of labour is increasingly modified, to make more and more labour productive in the capitalistic sense, for example through marketisation and privatisation, value-based management, and Taylorism. * whether work has been productive can really be known only \\"after the fact\\" in capitalist society, because commodity-producing living labour is in most cases definitely valued by the market only after it has been performed, when its product (a good or service) is exchanged and paid for. Marx accordingly made, explicitly or implicitly 10 distinctions relevant to defining productive labour in a capitalist mode of production: * commodity production, versus other production * capitalist production versus non-capitalist production * production versus circulation (exchange) * production for profit, versus non-profit production * productive consumption versus unproductive consumption * material (tangible) production, versus non-material production * production of use values, versus production of exchange-values * production of value, versus appropriation of revenue * production of income, versus distribution of income * production versus destruction In most cases, using these distinctions, it would be obvious whether the labour was capitalistically productive or not, but in a minority of cases it would be not altogether clear or controversial. In part, that is because the division of labour is not static but constantly evolving. The general criterion which Marx suggests is that: \\"If we have a function which, although in and for itself unproductive, is nevertheless a necessary moment of [economic] reproduction, then when this is transformed, through a division of labour, from the secondary activity of many into the exclusive activity of a few, into their special business, this does not change the character of the function itself\\" (Capital Vol. 2, Penguin ed., p. 209). Obviously, functions falling outside capitalist production altogether would not be capitalistically productive. Generally, Marx seems to have regarded labour as mainly unproductive from the point of view of capitalist society as a whole, if it involved functions which have to do purely with: * the maintenance of a class-based social order as such (legal system, police, military, government administration). * the maintenance and securing of private property relations (police, security, legal system, banking, accounting, licensing authorities etc.). * operating financial transactions (in banking, financing, commercial trade, financial administration) * insurance and safety. * criminal activity. Such activities were an inevitable cost to capitalist society which had to be met from reserves and from current income. This didn't necessarily mean that unproductive functions are not socially useful or economically useful in some sense; they might well be, but they normally did not directly add net new value to the total social product, that was the point, they were a (necessary) financial cost to society, paid for by a transfer of value created by the productive sector. Thus, they represented an appropriation or deduction from the surplus product, and not a net addition to it. Obviously, unproductive activities could stimulate productive activities however (for example, the production of security installations). Many unproductive costs are accepted by business, either because they involve activities which lower total business costs, and thereby indirectly contribute to income, or because they are unavoidable in doing business. In the division of labour of modern advanced societies, unproductive functions in this Marxian sense occupy a very large part of the labour force; the wealthier a society is, the more \\"unproductive\\" functions it can afford. In the USA for example, one can calculate from labour force data that facilitating exchange processes and processing financial claims alone is the main activity of more than 20 million workers. Legal staff, police, security personnel and military employees number almost 5 million workers. Productive labour as misfortune In the first volume of Das Kapital, Marx suggests that productive labour may be a misfortune: The idea here seems to be that being capitalistically \\"productive\\" effectively means \\"being exploited,\\" or, at least, being employed to do work under the authority of someone else. Marx never finalised his concept of capitalistically productive labour, but clearly it involved both a technical relation (between work and its useful effect) and a social relation (the economic framework within which it was performed). Ecological critique The ecological critique focuses on mindless \\"production for production's sake\\", attacking both the neoclassical notion and the Marxist concept of \\"productiveness\\". It is argued neoclassical economics can understand the value of anything (and therefore the costs and benefits of an activity) only if it has a price, real or imputed. However, physical and human resources may have a value which cannot be expressed in price terms, and to turn them into an object of trade via some legal specification of property rights may be harmful to human life on earth. Activities may have non-priced costs and benefits which never feature on the balance sheet, at most in propaganda and advertising. The Marxian view is also dismissed by ecologists, because it argues only human labour-time is the substance and source of economic value in capitalist society. Again, it is argued a very restricted idea of economic value is being operated with by Marxists. In part, this misses Marx's own point, namely that it was not him, but the growth of commercial trade which made labour-exploitation the fulcrum of wealth creation. Nevertheless, the ecological argument is that for the sake of a healthy future and a sustainable biosphere, a new valuation scheme for people and resources needs to be adopted. The core of this critique is clearly an ethical one: all the existing economic theories provide no healthy norms that would ensure correct stewardship for the environment in which all people have to live. Markets provide no moral norms of their own apart from the law of contract. To develop a better concept of \\"productiveness\\" would require a new morality, a new view of human beings and the environment in which they live, so that harmful economic activity can be outlawed, and healthy alternatives promoted. Ecologists typically distinguish between \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" market trade and production. Some believe capitalism can \\"go green\\" (producing in an environmentally friendly way), and that capitalism is \\"cleaner\\" than Soviet- type socialism. Others think that capitalism cannot \\"go green\\" because of the nature of the beast; so long as human accounting is done in terms of private costs and private profits, many \\"external effects\\" (externalities) will be disregarded, and at most legal restrictions and taxation can limit the environmental damage somewhat. Material product accounts in Soviet-type societies In the Soviet Union and later other socialist countries in Eastern Europe, China and Cuba, a system of social accounts was created based around the notion of the \\"material product\\" (Material Product System, or MPS). This was an alternative to GDP based accounts. Behind the MPS was a modernization theory according to which the criterion of progress consisted of the physical quantity of material goods being produced. This system was, paradoxically, strongly influenced by Marx's critique of wealth creation in capitalist society, and his distinction between capitalistically productive and unproductive labour. The \\"material product\\" represented, in price terms, the net new value created annually by the production of tangible material goods. Many service industries were excluded from the material product; a rigorous statistical attempt was made to separate out a productive sector and an unproductive sector. Enterprise managers could be punished by law if they failed to provide accurate information. Dissident socialists objected to this approach, because they felt that in a socialist society, \\"productive\\" labour should really be defined by such things as: * whether the labour increases tangible wealth * whether it is socially useful * whether it is ecologically responsible * whether it promotes human satisfaction * whether it promotes human development * whether it promotes human health and wellbeing Since the end of communist rule in the USSR and Eastern Europe, however, the material product system has been abandoned, and new GDP-based accounts have been implemented following international standards recommended by the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the United Nations System of National Accounts (UNSNA). The advantage of this change is that economic activity is more comprehensively valued and visible in monetary terms; a possible disadvantage is that no national accounting is done anymore of physical product units (e.g., x tons of steel produced, or y number of tractors assembled).

He was born in Pithiviers to a prosperous family. Although it is not known to whom he was apprenticed, he received his artistic training from 1622 to 1628, and entered the guild of St.-Germaine-des-Pr√©s as a master painter on May 23, 1629.B√©n√©zit et al. 2006, p. 1348. His earliest surviving paintings are still lifes.Winkfield 2014, p. 10. Around 1632‚Äì33 he traveled to Italy, where he settled in Rome. After 1641 he worked in Paris, where he died in 1663. Most of his surviving subject pictures are religious works, including numerous small paintings representing the Virgin and Child or the Holy Family.Turner 1996, v3: p. 399. No painted portraits by his hand are known to have survived, although several are known through engravings. None of his works are dated. The divergence of style between Bauguin's still lifes and his religious paintings is, according to the art historian Arnaud Brejon de Lavergn√©e, \\"one of the great paradoxes of seventeenth-century French art: that one and the same artist ... should have produced still-life paintings controlled by a subtly rigorous construction and learned use of rules, as well as religious and mythological subject pictures with an evidently decorative character; compounding the enigma is the fact that the still lifes are signed while the subject paintings are not.\\"de Lavergn√©e 2002. During the twentieth century, some scholars speculated that there were two painters with the same name.Winkfield 2014, p. 9. The four still lifes securely attributed to Baugin‚ÄîStill life with Apricots, Still life with Candlestick, Still life with Chessboard (also known as The Five Senses), and Still life with Water Wafers‚Äîwere completed before the artist was twenty years of age. Trevor Winkfield calls Baugin \\"one of the most innovative of all French still life painters\\", and says the off-balance perspective of the Still life with Chessboard produces a \\"topographical alienation\\" reminiscent of the metaphysical art of Giorgio de Chirico.Winkfield 2014, p. 15. In contrast to the precise observation of Baugin's still lifes, his religious and historical paintings are stylized and graceful, showing the influence of Raphael and Parmigianino. He often painted several versions of a composition using different techniques, so that one may be thinly painted in broad, opaque tones while another is painted using enamel-like glazes.

The film was actress Billie Bird's last screen appearance. Reviews were negative, and the film was a box office bomb.  Plot Tommy Collins is an unemployed erotic dancer living at his mother's home in a trailer park while he looks for a decent job. He finds out that she and her boyfriend Jed, a polystyrene collector, are going to Las Vegas to be married and taking the mobile home with them. Although his mother had arranged for Tommy to stay with the Woodalls, he considers them awful people and decides to look for other living arrangements for him and his chihuahua Peanut (who loves the game show Jeopardy!). He rummages through the trash and finds his letter for jury duty that he had thrown away and decides to enter. Each of the jurors get their own free accommodation plus $5 a day. After several cases he gets chosen to be a juror for a murder case involving a man named Carl Wayne Bishop, a fast food employee who had been fired and is now accused of murdering several other fast food employees. The evidence against him gets stronger when several employees appear as witnesses saying that he threatened to kill them. All the jurors are staying at the Holiday Suite in the section that is being remodeled. Tommy seems to be enjoying himself, until he finds he is sharing his room with his former high school principal, who puts motivational tapes on at night to full blast. He makes a deal with the manager of the hotel who says that he will get a different room if he advertises their business during news broadcasts. Tommy agrees and ends up staying in a luxurious suite. Finally the jurors go to the jury room for deliberation and appoint Tommy as their foreman. The other jurors immediately think that Bishop is guilty and want to vote straight away. Not wanting to lose his suite and luxurious lifestyle, Tommy votes not guilty and stalls and prolongs the deliberations as well as continuously going over the evidence. After many delays, the other jurors become increasingly angry with Tommy, especially Monica, whom Tommy had fallen in love with, and threaten to throw him out of the jury unless he finds a better way to prove Bishop's innocence. After reading up on the law and further investigating, both of which activities are prohibited under standard instructions to jurors, Tommy finds some evidence after seeing a picture of Carl Wayne Bishop on the window of a store, finally convincing the jurors that Bishop is not guilty; they celebrate. Unfortunately, later on, Monica finds Peanut and follows him up to Tommy's luxury suite, with security guard Murphy following her. Even though Tommy tries to explain that he is now a changed person, she is deeply upset on how he used them and walks out in tears. Later the Judge declares a mistrial and arranges another hearing at a later date. Back at the trailer park, Tommy goes mining for polystyrene with Jed at the city dump. After seeing many polystyrene containers with fast food logos on them, Tommy realizes that the murderer was an environmentalist. He calls Monica, who immediately hangs up on him, but he goes looking for Frank, another fellow juror, who was also obsessed with the environment. Later that night someone meets another man named Frank who thanks him for volunteering to do jury duty on his behalf while he was on vacation, only to be killed with a stun gun. The killer is revealed to be Frank, the man Tommy was seeking. Tommy arrives at the same house and relays his new evidence to Frank, asking Frank to help find Monica at the library she works at in order to convince her that his evidence is genuine. When they arrive at the library, Frank reveals to Tommy and Monica that he was the killer. He ties them up and attempts to stab them with a sharp jagged knife. He tells them that he committed these terrible murders and framed Carl Wayne Bishop because he thought there was no truth and justice in the world. With Peanut's help, however, they manage to subdue Frank and knock him unconscious. Tommy is given a check for his contribution in the case and Monica starts dating Tommy. He uses his earnings from erotic dancing towards law school and eventually becomes an attorney. Meanwhile, Peanut is shown accomplishing his lifelong dream of becoming a contestant on Jeopardy!.

Critic Leonard Maltin gave it a \\"BOMB\\" rating in his book Movie and Video Guide, but suggested even that rating \\"may be too high\\". Critic Roger Ebert said, on At the Movies, that Pauly Shore was the \\"cinematic equivalent of long fingernails, drawn very slowly and quite loudly over a gigantic blackboard\\" and noted that although his co-host, Gene Siskel, disliked Chris Farley, he would \\"rather attend a dusk-to-dawn Chris Farley film festival than sit through any 5 minutes of Jury Duty\\". Siskel agreed, referring to Shore as \\"aggravating\\". Ebert estimated that Shore's \\"appeal must be limited to people whose self-esteem and social skills are so damaged that they find humor, or at least relief, in at last encountering a movie character less successful than themselves\\".

The volcano is said to be where Kanlaon made her presence felt to the people. In ancient times, native priests and priestesses (babaylan) would climb up the volcano and do rituals every good harvest season or when there was a special ceremony.

It was formerly known as Colonia Presidente Stroessner, but was changed after the fall of the dictator Alfredo Stroessner. Minga Guaz√∫ was established in 1958 and is located in the Department of Alto Paran√°, 20 km. west of the department capital, Ciudad del Este. The Guaran√≠ International Airport is located in the city. The name Its name derives from the Quechua word \\"minga\\", which means \\"cooperative work for improvement\\" and the Guaran√≠ word \\"guasu\\", meaning big. These two words together mean Big Work in Community, more or less. History Minga Guaz√∫ was founded and grew due to labor of the Salesians of Don Bosco, led by the priest Guido Coronel, the founder of the town. In the mid-1960s, Coronel decided to build a city 20 kilometers away from the border with Brazil. The center of the city, however, is located 16 kilometers away; the development at 20 kilometers is second in population. Weather The average annual temperature is 21 ¬∞C, the highest reaches 38 ¬∞C and the minimum 0 ¬∞C. The highest annual amount of the country in rainfall occurs in the region of Alto Paran√°. Demography Of the 60,719 inhabitants, 31,358 were males and 29,361 females, according to estimates by the Directorate General of Statistics, Census and Surveys. Economy Much of the economic activity of the city is based on the Cooperative that include its inhabitants, now converted into a real agro- industrial complex. Its main product is soybeans, in addition to maize, cassava, cotton, wheat, mate, sugarcane, poultry, vegetables and beans. The biggest oil industry of Paraguay is in Minga Guaz√∫, the multinational \\"Cargill\\". Tourism The Guarani Airport is located in the city of Minga Guaz√∫, one of the most modern airports in South America, located 4 km from Route VII \\"Dr. Gaspar Rodriguez de Francia\\" and 30 km from Ciudad del Este. The Minga Guaz√∫ Expo is conducted annually in September and the Patronal party is celebrated on May 24, the day of Mary Help of Christians. On July 6 is celebrated the \\"Day of Minguero.\\" It has two major urban centres in the Km 20 and Km 16. In the first, in 1966 was built a school and a church dedicated to the patron saint of Agro, \\"Maria Auxiliadora\\". Years later was established the Cooperative Minga Guaz√∫, which enabled the villagers to a more dignified life and better working conditions. In another center, are key public institutions and the Don Bosco College. In the area the rivers are Monday, Acaray, the stream Acaray-mi and Santa Maria. A very attractive club to tourists is the Paradise Golf Club, located 24 km from Ciudad del Este, on Route VII. At lakeside, there are bungalows for visitors, so they can make riding, archery and aerobic, in the lake is practised sport fishing of species such as tilapia. You can taste the dishes of international cuisine at the restaurant Club, on the banks of a beautiful pool and natural landscapes. For children there is a lot with games and activities.

She founded Virago Press in 1973.Brockes, Emma, \\"The fearful fighter\\", The Guardian, 25 August 2007. She is a recipient of the Benson Medal from the Royal Society of Literature in 2017.\\"The Benson Medal\\", The Royal Society of Literature. Early years and family Callil was born in Melbourne, Australia, but has lived in London since 1960. Her widowed mother, Lorraine Clare Allen, raised four children, of whom Callil was the third. Her father, Frederick Alfred Louis Callil, was a barrister and lecturer in French at the University of Melbourne. She was educated at Star of the Sea Convent and at Loreto Mandeville Hall. She graduated from the University of Melbourne with a Bachelor of Arts degree in History and Literature in 1960. Career In the same year she left for Europe, and, after a period in Italy, settled in London in 1964. She worked for Marks & Spencer as a buying assistant, then, after placing an advertisement in The Times (\\"Australian, B.A. wants job in book publishing\\"), began work at Hutchinson in 1965.Sleeman, Elizabeth, \\"CALLIL, Carmen Th√©r√®se\\", The International Who's Who of Women 2002, 3rd edition, London: Europa Publications, 2002, p. 87. From 1967 to 1970 she was publicity manager of the paperback imprint Panther Books. An example of her work was when Callil lobbied BBC producer Lorna Pegram to employ B. S. Johnson to talk about his book The Unfortunates for the TV series \\"Release\\". Johnson's book had 8 parts that could be read in many different orders. With barely any negotiation the interview was ready months before the book was ready for publication. The film included Johnson holding a mock-up of the book that was not at all similar to the final publication. Callil was later given responsibility for all imprints of Granada Publishing, and then at Anthony Blond and Andr√© Deutsch. She left to work for Ink, a countercultural newspaper founded by Richard Neville, Andrew Fisher, Felix Dennis and Ed Victor in 1971. Ink was an offshoot of Oz and was intended to be a bridge between the underground press of the 1960s and the national newspapers of that time. Launched in May 1971, it collapsed in February 1972, following the Oz obscenity trial.\\"Ink\\" at rock'sbackpages library. At Ink, Callil met Marsha Rowe and Rosie Boycott, who soon afterwards founded the feminist magazine Spare Rib in June 1972. At the same time, Callil founded Virago Press (initially known as Spare Rib Books), to \\"publish books which celebrated women and women's lives, and which would, by so doing, spread the message of women's liberation to the whole population\\", through the work of new and neglected women writers.Sullivan, Jane, \\"Turning Pages: In celebration of feminist publishing\\", The Sydney Morning Herald, 11 November 2016. Rowe and Boycott became directors of Virago in its first years.\\"About Virago Press\\" , Virago.co.uk; accessed 26 November 2015. Also in 1972 Callil launched a book publicity company, Carmen Callil Limited. Harriet Spicer became Callil's assistant. This company, run by Spicer and Callil, helped to finance Virago in its early years, together with Callil's inheritance from her grandfather. Further assistance came from Quartet Books, with whom the first nine Virago titles were published. Ursula Owen became a part-time editor in 1974. She was to become a full-time director, with considerable responsibility for the content of the Virago publishing list. In 1976 Virago became an independent company,Toynbee, Polly, \\"From the archive, 26 January 1981: Virago Press gives women writers a voice\\", The Guardian, 26 January 2015. with Callil, Owen and Spicer as directors, shortly to be joined by Lennie Goodings and Alexandra Pringle. In 1982 Callil was appointed managing director of Chatto & Windus and The Hogarth Press, where she remained until 1994, continuing also as chairman of Virago until 1995. In 1994 she was Editor-At-Large for the worldwide group of Random House publishing companies. At Virago, among other business and editorial aspects of the company she was responsible for the creation and development of the Virago Modern Classics list, which brought back into print many hundreds of the best women writers of the past.Callil, Carmen ‚ÄúThe Stories of our Lives: Carmen Callil on Virago\\", The Guardian, 26 April 2008. Callil left book publishing in 1994, and for some years divided her time between London and Caunes-Minervois in France. As a writer and critic, she has contributed reviews and features to many newspapers and journals, in addition to undertaking occasional radio and television work. From 1985 to 1991 she was a member of the Board of Channel 4 Television. She was a member of the committee for the Booker Prize, 1979‚Äì84; a founder director of the Groucho Club, London, 1984‚Äì94, and in 1989 received the Distinguished Service Award from the International Women's Writing Guild.

It was developed from the German Mauser Gewehr 98 line, and features a very similar bolt design. The rifle was designed in Czechoslovakia shortly after World War I, to replace the Vz. 98/22, also a Czech-designed derivative of the Gewehr 98. The vz. 24 featured a barrel which was shorter and considered more handy than the Gewehr 98 barrel. The vz. 24 was chambered in 7.92√ó57mm Mauser like its predecessors. Throughout the late 1920s and into the 1930s, Czechoslovakia exported hundreds of thousands of vz. 24 rifles to various countries across the globe, with variants chambered in the original 7.92√ó57mm Mauser, 7√ó57mm Mauser, and 7.65√ó53mm Argentine. These included contracts for several South American countries, most of which were 7 mm or 7.65 mm guns. Around 40,000 rifles were sent to Spanish Republican forces during the Spanish Civil War. Nearly 200,000 rifles were purchased by China, seeing action in the Second Sino-Japanese War, which became part of World War II. Iran purchased vz. 24 rifles, along with two other variants, through the late 1920s and 1930s, and later produced their own copies in the late 1940s. Germany acquired hundreds of thousands of the rifles in 1939 when they occupied Czechoslovakia and pressed them into service under the designation \\"Gewehr 24(t)\\"; during the occupation, production of the rifles continued until 1942, when the factories were converted to the German- designed Karabiner 98k. During this period, several hundred thousand rifles were also built for the Romanian Army. Vz. 24 rifles saw extensive service during World War II in multiple theaters, predominantly with the German and Romanian armies on the Eastern Front. Lithuanian vz. 24s, which had been captured during the German invasion in 1941, were later seized by Soviet forces, who in turn used them to arm the Viet Cong during the Vietnam War in the 1960s. Development and service with the Czechoslovak Army vz. 24 rifle After World War I, the Austro-Hungarian Empire was dismantled; one of the new states to emerge from the ruins of the Habsburg Monarchy was Czechoslovakia. The new state received control of the Skoda factory in Brno, which was renamed the Brno Arms Works in November 1918. The following year, the factory began producing the first short rifles based on the German Gewehr 98 design, the Mauser Jelen√°. At least 150 of the rifles were chambered in 7mm Mauser, with at least as many also chambered in 7.92√ó57mm Mauser. The original Gewehr 98 rifle featured a barrel that was long, which proved to be too long and cumbersome in the trench fighting of World War I.Grant, p. 19 Nevertheless, Brno developed the long vz. 98/22 in 1922 from the basic Gewehr 98 design, with a long barrel, along with a vz. 98/22 Short Rifle variant, though it did not see significant production.Ball, pp. 111-112Walter, p. 319 Starting in 1923, Brno decided to develop a rifle based on the German Karabiner 98AZ, a shortened version of the Gewehr 98 with a barrel. This resulted in the vz. 23, a rifle with a long barrel that was initially produced with parts cannibalized from other rifles. The design was further refined into the vz. 23A, which consisted of newly manufactured components. Further refinements produced the vz. 24, which entered production in 1924. That year, Brno Arms Works, which had been controlled by the Czechoslovak government, was privatized to encourage export sales.Ball, pp. 113, 115‚Äì116 The vz.24 became the primary rifle of the Czechoslovak Army before World War II. It resembled the German Karabiner 98k, which it predated by more than a decade. Unlike the K98k, the vz. 24 has a longer top handguard, and it retains a straight bolt handle.Ball, pp. 115-116 Between 1924 and 1938, Czechoslovakia manufactured more than 775,600 rifles, with the first rifles entering service in 1926. The final order was placed in July 1938, as tensions escalated with Nazi Germany over the Sudeten Germans. Following the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, production continued for the Slovak Republic (a Nazi client state). The exact number of rifles manufactured between 1938 and 1939 is unknown, but may be less than 10,000, based on serial numbers of surviving rifles.Ball, p. 121 =Description= The vz. 24 was a bolt action design based on the Mauser action, featuring a straight bolt handle. The rifle's barrel, which was long, featured 4-groove rifling with a right-hand twist. Overall, the rifle was long, and it weighed . The primary chambering was for 7.92√ó57mm Mauser, but export variants were also chambered for 7√ó57mm Mauser and 7.65√ó53mm Argentine. Ammunition was stored in a five-round, fixed, internal magazine that fit flush with the bottom of the stock, which was fed with stripper clips. The rifles were fitted with tangent rear sights that were graduated in increments, up to a maximum range of .Ball, p. 118 The front sight blade was fitted with a protector to prevent it from being damaged. The rifle's stock featured a semi- pistol grip and an upper hand guard that extended from the forward receiver ring to the forward barrel band. Sling swivels were placed on the bottom rear of the butt and the left side of the grip and on the rear barrel band. Grasping grooves were placed just forward of the recoil lug to aid in handling the rifle. A cleaning rod was stored in the stock under the barrel. Export and foreign combat employment Many South American countries purchased the vz. 24 rifle in various calibers. Between 1928 and 1938, the Bolivian Army purchased 101,000 vz. 24 rifles, which were chambered in 7.65√ó53mm Argentine. These rifles were used against Paraguay during the Chaco War in the 1930s,Ball, pp. 57, 59 and many of them were captured by the Paraguayan Army, which in turn used them against Bolivia.Ball, p. 116 Colombia ordered 10,000 rifles between 1929 and 1937 and Venezuela purchased an unknown number of rifles in 1930; both countries' rifles were chambered in 7 mm.Ball, pp. 105, 123 In 1932, Brazilian revolutionaries ordered 15,000 rifles, which were built with bent bolt handles.Ball, pp. 68-69 Peru ordered 5,000 rifles chambered in 7 mm in 1934, and Ecuador purchased 30,000 rifles in 7.92 mm in 1936. Guatemala and El Salvador ordered 4,000 and 300 7.92 mm rifles in 1937, respectively, and Nicaragua purchased 1,000 7 mm rifles that year. Also in 1937, Uruguay ordered 6,000 rifles in 7 mm, of which 2,000 were vz. 32/Modelo 1932 variants, which were essentially lightened vz. 24s.Ball, p. 123 Several European countries also acquired the rifle, all in the 7.92 mm caliber. The Lithuanian Army acquired the vz. 24 in the 1930s, and many of these rifles were captured by German forces during Operation Barbarossa before falling into the hands of the Soviet Army later in the war. Some of these rifles were then sent to Vietnam to arm the Viet Cong, and some were captured a third time by American forces during the Vietnam War.Ball, pp. 116, 118 Yugoslavia purchased 40,000 rifles in 1926, all of which came from Czechoslovak Army stockpiles, and a further 10,000+ between 1928 and 1930. These rifles saw action during World War II during the German invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, as well as during the Partisans' insurgency against the German occupation. In 1935, Latvia traded surplus No. 1 Mk. III Lee‚ÄìEnfield rifles for 15,000 vz. 24s; Brno Arms Works in turn sold the Lee‚ÄìEnfields to Iraq.Ball, p. 122 During World War II, Latvian resistance fighters employed the vz. 24s that had been ordered by the Latvian Army against the German occupation forces.Ball, p. 246 The vz. 24 also saw action in the Spanish Civil War by the Catalan Republican troops. About 40,000 vz. 24s were bought by the Soviet Union from Czechoslovakia to be sent to the Spanish Civil War. The vz. 24s were shipped from Murmansk on 1 March 1938, along with other material (T-26 tanks and 76 mm French field artillery). The French freighter , which carried all the material, managed to get the weapons to Bordeaux from where they were sent by land across the border to Catalonia. Despite arriving late in the war, the vz. 24 was used in Catalonia and the Mediterranean coast of the Iberian Peninsula and saw action in the Battle of the Ebro, where the vz. 24 showed good results despite the Francoist-Nationalist victory. After the defeat of the Second Spanish Republic, Generalissimo Francisco Franco kept the rifles that survived the battle until 1959, when they were sold to Interarms. Starting in 1927, the Chinese Nationalist government began ordering rifles, and by 1937 had purchased 195,000 vz. 24s. They saw action during the Second Sino-Japanese War in the late 1930s and many of these rifles were captured by Japanese forces. They were then used to arm five infantry divisions stationed in ChinaBall, pp. 81-82 as well as the Collaborationist Chinese Army.Jowett 2004, p. 71 After the war, Japan surrendered the rifles to China, which were then issued to Nationalist forces for use during the Chinese Civil War.Ball, p. 93 China manufactured a copy of the vz. 24 that featured a shorter barrel and a side folding bayonet.Ball, p. 99 Some of these rifles were captured by the People's Liberation Army and used in Korea.Smith, p. 295 Japan also ordered 40,000 rifles for the Imperial Japanese Navy in 1938. After World War II, rifles from Czechoslovakia were sent to Iraq. In 1967, the secessionist state of Biafra ordered various weapons from Czechoslovakia, including 1,860 vz. 24 rifles. =German G24(t)= After the occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1938, the Germans took existing stocks of the vz.24 into service under the designation Gewehr 24(t) ('t' being the national origin designator tschechoslowakisch, the German word for \\"Czechoslovak\\"; such national origin designators were German practice for all foreign weapons taken into service). The G24(t) rifles manufactured after the German occupation were completed to a modified design to adhere to German standards. This included changes to the butt stock, with slots cut to fit German slings and the installation of the disc and hollow rod assembly that allowed soldiers to disassemble their bolts.Ball, pp. 226‚Äì227 Brno continued production of the rifle, which progressively gained some K98k features as stocks of pre-war components were used up. The original flat butt plate was replaced with the cupped butt plate of the K98k type, and the walnut stocks were replaced with easier to produce laminate versions. In 1942, the production line at the Pova≈æsk√° Bystrica plant was converted entirely to building K98k rifles and the main plant in Brno was similarly converted the following year.Grant, p. 61Law, p. 179 Over the course of 1941 and 1942, a total between 255,000 and 330,000 G24(t) rifles were built before production switched over to the K98ks. The G24(t) rifles did not receive the old Czechoslovak stampings, and instead only bore standard army proof marks and Waffenamt inspection codes.Walter, p. 315 =Romanian vz. 24s= Romanian- contract vz. 24 showing the serial number prefaced with the \\"XR\\" code In the late 1920s and early 1930s, the Romanian Army decided to adopt the vz. 24 rifle as its standard infantry rifle, though it had not acquired enough weapons to fully arm its troops by the time the country entered World War II in 1941.Ball, p. 305 The first orders for the vz. 24 rifles were placed in 1938 after the German invasion. Romanian-contract vz. 24s have a two-letter prefix at the start of the serial number, the first letter being variable and the second \\"R\\" to designate Romania. Each initial letter denotes manufacturing blocks of 25,000 rifles. Romanian vz. 24s \\"AR\\", \\"BR\\", \\"CR\\" through \\"YR\\" represent different periods of manufacturing, though several blocks have not been reported, including \\"IR\\", \\"JR\\", \\"KR\\", \\"MR\\", \\"NR\\", \\"QR\\", \\"VR\\", and \\"ZR\\". Over the course of the contract, the Czechs manufactured between 400,000 and 750,000 Romanian vz. 24s. The first two years of production included royal crests for the King of Romania, though rifles built from 1940 onward do not feature crests, and many of the surviving early rifles have had their crests ground off. By mid-1943, 445,640 rifles had been received by the Romanian Army.Axworthy, p. 29 Romania was part of the Axis for much of World War II, from 1941 to 1944. Romanian vz. 24s saw action in Ukraine, Bessarabia, and in particularly heavy fighting during the Battle of Stalingrad. It was not until 1944, after significant defeats at the hands of the Soviet Red Army, that Romania joined the Allies.Zabecki, p. 638 =Iranian Brno= In 1929, Iran ordered 30,000 vz. 24 rifles chambered in 7.92 mm, all of which came from Czechoslovak Army stocks. A further order for 240,000 rifles was placed in 1930, though these were for the vz.98/29 variant with a longer barrel; another order for 30,000 vz. 98/29 \\"musketon\\" rifles was placed at the same time. Like several other countries' orders, the initial contract for the 30,000 vz. 24s came from Czechoslovak Army stocks, while the later orders for the vz. 98/29 variants were new production guns. The total order was not completed before Czechoslovakia was conquered by Germany. The \\"musketon\\" rifles were designated as the Model 30 carbine, and in the late 1940s, Czechoslovakia assisted the Iranians with setting up a factory to manufacture their own license-built copies, the Model 49 carbine.Ball, pp. 282‚Äì286 The rifles, which were referred to as \\"Brnos\\" or \\"Bernos\\", after their city of manufacture, proved to be prized by Iran's various tribal groups, which frequently rebelled against the government of the Shah. After Reza Shah was deposed in 1941 by the Anglo- Soviet invasion of Iran, significant numbers of the rifles fell into the hands of tribal rebels, and they were used in tribal conflicts throughout the 1950s.Khosronejad, p. 212 During the Anglo-Soviet occupation, the Soviets seized and distributed 10,000 of the Brnos to Kurdish tribes in western Iran, which they also helped to train. The Kurdish force proved to be the basis of the Peshmerga.Koohi-Kamali, p. 111 Users *Jowett 2016, p. 22    * *Ball, p. 242   * * Romania * Slovak Republic * Spain  * Viet Cong * See also *vz. 33 rifle *M24 series *List of common World War II infantry weapons FootnotesReferences    * * External links *Rifle model 24 (pu≈°ka vz. 24) photogallery *Weapons of Czechoslovakia interwar period Category:7.92√ó57mm Mauser rifles Category:7.65√ó53mm Mauser rifles Category:Bolt-action rifles Category:Rifles of Czechoslovakia Category:World War II infantry weapons Category:Mauser rifles Category:7√ó57mm Mauser rifles ","title":"Vz. 24"},{"id":"2292982","text":"San Jos√© Obrero is a district of the Cordillera Department, Paraguay.

In the 11th century it became a possession of the Bishops of Arezzo, and renamed \\"Civitella del Vescovo\\" (\\"Little Bishop's City\\"). In the 13th century the city was destroyed after the battle of Pieve al Toppo, cited by Dante Alighieri and fought nearby between Arezzo and Siena. After the Aretine defeat at Campaldino (1289) the city was annexed by Florence. In 1311 Arezzo regained it, holding until 1348, whenceforth it remained the seat of a Florentine podest√†. Civitella enjoys one of the most scenic views of the Arezzo valley. On 29 June 1944, 244 citizens of Civitella were massacred by Hermann G√∂ring Division, in retaliation for the killing of two German soldiers by the hands of partisans.

The population of the city is 9,688.Direccio√≥n General de Estad√≠stica, Encuentras, y Censos. Censo Nacional de Poblaci√≥n y Viviendas 2002.  History  Tobati was founded in June 1539 by Domingo Mart√≠nez de Irala. There are various opinions as to the meaning of the town's name. One is from the Spanish definition of the word, referring to the rocky terrain, consisting largely of limestone. Another is that it is the combination of the Guaran√≠ language words \\"tova,\\" meaning \\"face\\" and \\"t√≠,\\" meaning \\"nose,\\" or together - \\"nose on the face.\\" The third option is that the name is a combination of the Guaran√≠ words, tova, and morot√≠ - referring to an indigenous legend of a white faced warrior priest who would come to lead the tribes into a glorius era.Teofilo Caceres Vega. Tobati: Tava - Pueblo - Ciudad. One of the greatest heroes in Paraguayan history, the \\"Liberator of Paraguay,\\" Captain Pedro Juan Caballero hailed from Aparypy, Tobati. Captain Caballero was the leader of the Paraguayan War for Independence from Spain, and is known as a very able military tactician. Caballero continued to serve his country after the War for Independence as one of the members of the governing Junta of Paraguay until the ascension of the \\"Perpetual Dictator,\\" Doctor Jos√© Gaspar Rodr√≠guez de Francia. Tobati was the subject of two very well known and respected sociological studies and books. The first is titled, Tobati: A Paraguayan Town, by Helen and Elman Service. The second is titled Tobati : tradicion y cambio en un pueblo paraguayo, by Diego Hay.  Religion  As with most Paraguayan towns, Tobat√≠ is predominately Roman Catholic. There are small Evangelical, Baptist, and Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses communities present in the town as well. The town is divided into Barrios, generally named after Saints, and feast days of the Saints are celebrated in their respective Barrios as neighborhood events. The religious life of the town centers around the feast day of Mary of the Immaculate Conception, the Patron Saint of Tobat√≠, on December 8. The church in Tobat√≠ contains the holy relic carving of the Virgin Mary of Immaculate Conception, which was carved by an indigenous convert to Christianity hundreds of years ago. This Indian was pursued by his tribe to be put to death for his conversion to Christianity. As he hid behind a tree the Indian prayed to the Holy Mother for protection in turn for his devotion and promise to create an icon to glorify her. The tribe passed him by unnoticed and he subsequently carved two statues of the Holy Virgin. One resides in the church in Tobati, and the other in the Basilica in neighboring Caacupe.  Culture and artwork  Tobat√≠ is renowned throughout Paraguay for the woodworking, ceramics, and sculptures of its artisans. One artisan in particular, Don Zen√≥n P√°ez is world-renowned.  Economy  The major industry and income source for Tobat√≠ is the production of building materials. The majority of roofing tile and bricks supplying Paraguay have their origin in the many factories in Tobati. Additionally, much of the Tobate√±o production is exported to neighboring Argentina and Brazil. While some factories are modernized and run off electric machines and kilns, and some employ a mixture of modern and traditional methods, the vast majority are traditional operations. First, the clay for the products is milled in wooden churns powered by horses or mules walking in circles around the mill. Workers then form the tiles and bricks in hand molds and place them in the sun to dry. In the final step the products are cooked in wood fired kilns for 24 hours or more.  Team Tobati  Each year, a community service trip consisting of approximately 100 students from the Kingswood-Oxford School in West Hartford, Connecticut travel down to Tobat√≠. The group originated due to the organization of one instructor at the school, Ron Garcia, whose family is from Tobat√≠ and who still has many family members in the town. Team Tobati sends a large group of students and health care professionals each year over spring break to Tobat√≠, Paraguay on a public service trip to work with rural villages in providing access to health care and education. The group also sends smaller contingents of students and medical professionals at various times during the year. Additionally, Team Tobati has funded an artisan village and an educational institute, which are maintained year-round.

Biography =Early life and military service= Tanaka was born in Issai village, Hy≈çgo prefecture (now part of the city of Tatsuno) and was the younger son of a large landowner. His family claim descent from Akamatsu Mitsusuke, and served as village headmen during the Edo period. Tanaka graduated from the 19th class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1907. One of his classmates was Masaharu Homma. He graduated with honors 28th class of the Army Staff College in 1916, specializing in infantry, and was sent on an Army scholarship to England, where he earned a degree in English literature at Oxford University where he studied the works of William Shakespeare. He was the flag bearer for the Japanese troops in London's victory parade at the end of World War I in July 1918. he was promoted to major in 1922. In May 1926, he was assigned as military liaison to the Japanese consulate in Mexico. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in March 1927, and from March 1928 headed the North American Bureau within the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff. Promoted to colonel in August 1930, he was assigned command of the IJA 2nd Infantry Regiment until May 1932. Tanaka was subsequently posted as a military attach√© to Washington D.C., where he met Douglas MacArthur while MacArthur was Chief of Staff of the United States Army. He remained in the United States until May 1934. As a result of his long service in the United States and United Kingdom, and his openly pro-western sentiments, he was passed over for promotions as Japan militarized. From August 1934 to August 1935, Tanaka was Chief of Staff of the Osaka-based IJA 4th Division.Budge, The Pacific War Online Encyclopedia He was promoted to major general in August 1935 and was assigned command of the IJA 5th Infantry Brigade, which as a garrison force based in Manchukuo. A year later, he became director of the General Affairs department of the Kempeitai, and year after that, in August 1937, became commander of the Kempeitai in the Kwantung Leased Territory. He was promoted to lieutenant general in July 1938 and commander of the Kemptai the following month. =World War II= In August 1939, Tanaka was assigned as commander of the IJA 13th Division, and spent the following year in combat on the front lines during the Second Sino-Japanese War, especially the Battle of Wuhan and the Battle of Zaoyang‚ÄìYichang. In 1940, he was awarded both the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun and the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Sacred Treasure. He returned to Japan to resume his post was commandant of the Kempeitai in September 1940. After the start of the Pacific War, Tanaka, who had been vocal in his opposition to the attack on Pearl Harbor was reassigned to command of the Eastern District Army. Tanaka was sent to the Philippines in 1942 as commander of the IJA 14th Army, and subsequently served as Military-Governor of the Philippines from June 1942 to May 1943. However, he was forced to return to Japan in March 1943 to recover from malaria. He spent many months in the hospital, during which time he converted to the Seicho-no-Ie new religion. He was promoted to full general in September 1943. In August 1944, he was appointed commandant of the Army Staff College. In March 1945, he was assigned to head the Eastern District Army under the Japanese Twelfth Area Army.Ammenthorp, The Generals of World War II This consisted mostly of poorly trained reservists, conscripted students and home guard militia such as the Volunteer Fighting Corps as part of the last desperate defense effort by the Empire of Japan to deter landings of Allied forces in central Honsh≈´. As acting commander of the 1st Imperial Guards Division, his cooperation was crucial to the 15 August 1945 rebellion planned by Major Kenji Hatanaka and others. Hatanaka sought to occupy the Imperial Palace, and to prevent the Emperor's announcement of Japan's surrender from being broadcast. When Tanaka was asked to join the rebellion, he refused, and later mobilized the Eastern District Army against the coup. After making a number of phone calls, and ordering troops to relieve the Palace, he drove there himself and berated Hatanaka and the other conspirators.Brooks, Behind Japan's Surrender Despite being called 'the hero of the August 15 incident', and being almost singularly responsible for bringing an end to the attempted coup d'√©tat, Tanaka felt responsible for the damage done to Tokyo (his jurisdiction) by Allied bombing. Since his assignment on 19 March, he had attempted to resign three times, after he failed to prevent damage to Meiji Shrine, the Imperial Palace, and other important sites, but his resignations were refused. At the surrender of Japan, Tanaka told his subordinates to destroy their unit colors, but not to commit suicide; as burning the regiment's banners would be enough, and that he intended to take full responsibility himself, on behalf of all his men. On 24 August, at his office in Tokyo's Dai-ichi Life Building (later Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers headquarters), Tanaka shot himself through the heart; he left his desk covered in sutras, letters to his officers and his family, a statue of Emperor Meiji and a scroll bearing Emperor Hirohito's words to him following the August 15th incident.Chen, WW2 Data Base  References   External links   Notes  - Category:1887 births Category:1945 deaths Category:Military personnel from Hy≈çgo Prefecture Category:Suicides by firearm in Japan Category:Japanese military personnel who committed suicide Category:Japanese military personnel of World War II Category:Japanese generals Category:Alumni of the University of Oxford Category:Recipients of the Order of the Golden Kite Category:Grand Cordons of the Order of the Rising Sun Category:Recipients of the Order of the Sacred Treasure, 1st class ","title":"Shizuichi Tanaka"},{"id":"2292994","text":"Arroyos y Esteros (Spanish for Streams and Swamps) is a district of the Cordillera Department, Paraguay. Etymology Its name describes exactly the real aspect of this place, which is surrounded by swamps and streams. It was also named Tobat√≠ Tuy√°, which is one of the rivers of this region. Its founder, Governor Pedro de Melo de Portugal called it \\"Chapel Duarte\\", but in 1849 Carlos Antonio L√≥pez named it \\"Arroyos y Esteros\\". Information Arroyos y Esteros is a small town, growing economically as well as in population. There are approximately 20,000 people living in the district, but these are found mostly in 13 outlying satellite communities, with only 8,000 inhabitants in the center of town. The topography can best be described in the words of the towns founder, Father Fidel Ma√≠z, as having a lot of streams and swamps. Once quite isolated, Arroyos now sits on the International Highway 3, which allows for rapid transit to Asuncion and the possibility of round trip travel in the same day. Historically Arroyos has close ties to the larger and more prosperous Tobati, approx. 23 km to the south. Church of Arroyos y Esteros The principal economic activity in Arroyos y Esteros is agriculture, especially sugarcane. Pineapple and melons are other important crops. Sesame was introduced a few years ago and is slowly making inroads, despite some early crop failures. There are several large ranches in the area with cattle, and some other lesser animals (sheep, goats). The arrival of a sugar factory dedicated to producing organic sugar changed the face of the arroyense economy as many former small molasses factories shut down to deliver the raw material to the more efficient large factory. The town's fiesta patronal is October 4- San Francisco, however each company has its own fiesta patronal, also the Foundation Day, March 9, celebration invented by the current mayor to boost tourism in Arroyos y Esteros.

Front of the Municipality of Arroyos y Esteros Geography The land is completely surrounded by rivers, Piribebuy and Manduvir√° River, which are mouths of many swamps and streams before these important rivers flow into Paraguay River. According to a local legend, two images of the Mother Virgen were found, one of those is the one in Caacup√©, the faithful capital city of Paraguay, and the other one is in Tobat√≠. Arroyos y Esteros is a very wealthy region in vegetation because of its privileged location. Weather The weather is mild and dry. Temperature ranges from 23 to 27 Celsius (73.4-80.6 F) during winter 3 Celsius is the minimum. Demography Arroyos y Esteros has 22.723 inhabitants, who 12.052 are men and 10.670 women, according to the census (2002). There are 2.049 people in the urban area and 16.592 in the rural area. Because of not enough job opportunities, young people migrate to search for better life conditions. History This city was founded by the Governor Pedro de Melo de Portugal who gave the name ‚ÄúCapilla Duarte‚Äù, Carlos Antonio L√≥pez named it ‚ÄúArroyos y Esteros‚Äù in 1849. Since there is no exact date on the foundation, it was established Priest Fidel Maiz birth and death as the date the town celebrates its foundation, which is March 9. People who live there say that when the first President, Carlos Antonio L√≥pez, went to visit Priest Ma√≠z, said to the priest: \\"I had to cross rivers, streams and swamps to get here\\", and that is the reason this city was named Arroyos y Esteros.

It was released as a single CD (released as only 1 CD version, the first time since 1997) as a gatefold 7\\" vinyl, as well as on DVD format. It was nominated for the Kerrang! Award for Best Single. Inspiration and sound Orpheus was inspired by a Jack Kerouac on the road experience, similar to that of the film Y Tu Mama Tambien. Wheeler has said that, \\"The song's sort of based on this idea of like a Mexican road song sort of thing. I wrote it after watching this Mexican movie where these two kids go on this road trip with this girl, it's a rights of passage kind of thing. So I always thought it had this Mexican flavour, in fact when we first wrote the song it was called 'Dirty Sanchez' for a while!\\" Additionally, it is also inspired by a screen test Tim had a couple of years ago to play the Ewan McGregor part in 2001's 'Moulin Rouge'. \\"So I was in there with Baz Luhrmann, he is taking me through the whole thing and it was because he based the whole movie on the Greek myth of Orpheus. It's a weird song. It's about hitting the road and taking off and not being able to look back, just keep going is the theme. It's about a guy who joins him in fuckin' hell\\". Tim explains. \\"Orpheus\\" has been described by Ash's bassist, Mark Hamilton, as being \\"Chilli Peppers meet The Doors, Sabbath and well.. us\\". Rick later described it as being \\"a classic Tim Wheeler summer song with big riffs and mad freak out bits in it, that's quite a journey of a song. A musical journey.\\" Originally, the song was less complicated, and was missing its mid-song breakdown and intersection, but, despite the record label's pleas, it was included. Usage Ever since its first appearance at the Royal Albert Hall for the Teenage Cancer Trust charity, it has appeared in almost every Ash performance, and also appears on the limited edition live Meltdown CD and the Commando EP. It is one of the EA Trax in the videogames Burnout 3 and NHL 2005. The song appeared in various musical publications' lists of songs of 2004. B-sides The first b-side of the single is \\"Everybody's Happy Nowadays\\", a cover of the Buzzcocks single from their Singles Going Steady compilation, with a guest appearance from Coldplay's lead singer, Chris Martin, who sings lead vocals in the chorus. The song was recorded for the soundtrack to the film Shaun of the Dead. The single's second b-side was Ash's longest released track (until A-Z series single \\"Sky Burial\\" in 2010), \\"Tinseltown\\", which was originally meant to appear on the album itself. Mark has described it as \\"a 9¬Ω minute epic which goes on a music oddessy, covers every genre from '4 to the Floor Handbag' to Sonic Youth spaz outs and kraut rock\\". The song alternates between gentle acoustic and harsh dance floor beats. Video and DVD Like the video for \\"There's a Star\\", it was directed by Jeff Thomas. The video is a car chase across the desert with two bandits chasing the band in a Gumball Rally style vehicle. Mark described it as follows: \\"The video was made in Almeria, Southern Spain. It's basically a car chase across the desert with two bandits trying to run us off the road, total Wacky Racers stuff. Intercut with us performing in a dirty biker bar it's a full throttle sweatfest!\\" Wheeler has described it as: \\"It was fantastic, basically; flying off to Spain, getting in a car, smashing it up and rocking out! By the end of it the car was pretty much totaled on one side so we had to film the last shots from the other side of the car. The cars were like totally mangled. It was great, we got to drive through barrels of water as well, as you can see later on. The way we've got the numbers on the screen is, I suppose, reminiscent of a computer game.\\" \\"Orpheus\\" was also released as a DVD.

It is a variation of the sawing a woman in half illusion. Basic effect Four cubes with open tops and bottoms are stacked to form a cabinet. An assistant stands inside and the cabinet is closed. Metal blades are slid into the cabinet, apparently slicing the assistant into four pieces, and closing the top and bottom of each cube. The cubes are then unstacked, and restacked in a different order. Inset doors in the front of the cabinet are opened, and it appears that the assistant's body has divided and rearranged. The whole process is then reversed, and the assistant is released unharmed. The Mismade Girl is often performed as a production effect‚Äîfour cubes, each apparently too small to contain a person, are stacked into a cabinet, which is then opened to reveal someone inside. Sometimes the routine will omit the second restacking, and the magician may instead exchange numbers or pictures on the front of those cubes which appear to be out of order, apparently magically moving the divided parts of the assistant's body into the correct order. Variants There are two notable variants of the Mismade Girl. * Illusionist Peter Gossamer performs a version called Totally Tubular, which uses a vertical tube, made of a dark translucent plastic, with a crude humaniform outline on the front. After restacking, rather than opening doors, lights are turned on inside, apparently showing the assistant divided into pieces, before then opening the front of the slice containing the assistant's head. Instead of reversing the process, sections of the outline are exchanged, and the blades then removed. * A new version of the Mismade Girl has recently appeared, referred to either as the Italian Mismade, or Mismade Improved. In this version the assistant's hands and feet are in view for much of the illusion. This gives the impression that the illusion could not be performed using the method of the original Mismade Girl. Method One method as to how this illusion might be achieved is as follows: when the cabinet is closed, the assistant crouches down into the bottom cube. Hidden compartments in three of the cubes hold fake body parts, which are revealed by simply rotating the relevant cube when it is restacked and opening an inset door in what was originally the rear of the cabinet. The blade or blades dividing the bottom cube from that above have a trap door, allowing the assistant to show her head‚Äîapparently disembodied.YouTube video revealing this method Exposure The Masked Magician performed the Mismade Girl on his third television special, with Elizabeth Ramos as his assistant, and subsequently revealed the method as described above.

The main office is in Anand, Gujarat with regional offices throughout the country. NDDB's subsidiaries include IDMC Limited-Anand, Mother Dairy, Delhi, NDDB Dairy Services, Delhi and Indian Immunologicals Limited, Hyderabad. The Board was created to finance, support and support producer-owned and controlled organisations. Its programmes and activities seek to strengthen farmer cooperatives and support national policies that are favourable to the growth of such institutions. Cooperative principles and cooperative strategies are fundamental to the board's efforts. History It was founded by Dr. Verghese Kurien. The National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) was created in 1965, fulfilling the desire of the then prime minister of India -- the late Lal Bahadur Shastri to extend the success of the Kaira Cooperative Milk Producers' Union (Amul) to other parts of India. That success combined the wisdom and energy of farmers with professional management to successfully capture liquid milk and milk product markets while supporting farmer investment with inputs and services. The major success of this mission was achieved through the World Bank financed Operation Flood, which lasted for 26 years (1970 to 1996) and was responsible for making India the world's largest producer of milk. This operation was started with the objective of increasing milk production, augmenting farmer income and providing fair prices for consumers. NDDB has now integrated 1,17,575 dairy co-operatives in what it calls the Anand Pattern, linking the village society to the state federations in a three-tier structure. NDDB launched its Perspective Plan 2010 with four thrust areas: Quality Assurance, Productivity Enhancement, Institution Building and National Information.

The road movie romantic comedy is Dusl's first as a director. Plot In a month with two full moons, Austrian petty criminal Johnny Pichler is hired to carry a bag of cash to the Slovakian border and deliver it to a gangster. Johnny arrives late in a battered taxi. He is forced into the car behind the gangster's beautiful but unhappy escort. Shirley, who is no bimbo, squirts the gangster with an incapacitating spray, kicks him out of the car and races away with Johnny and the cash. The pair makes a series of unsuccessful attempts to sell the obviously stolen car. In a Slovak hotel Johnny offers to buy Shirley's share of the car with his share of the cash. She refuses but when he returns from the bar, she is gone. Lonely Johnny teams up with Ignaz Springer, an East German con man who is having trouble adapting to post-Communist Europe, but claims to have business interests in Ukraine: shoe import-export. Springer introduces Johnny to a couple of Slovak waitresses and then disappears after selling the car without Johnny's knowledge. Johnny hitchhikes to Ukraine looking for Shirley with only the town Lviv stamped on a strip of photographs as a guide. In Lviv he meets a taxi driver who differs from Shirley only in her hair colour. Jana reveals that she is Shirley's twin sister and they soon become lovers. Jana tells him that Shirley's real name is Dana and that she had left Lviv some months ago after a bout of craziness. Johnny soon discovers that Jana is not being entirely honest with him. And the city is hardly welcoming: a gang force him to buy an ordinary brick from them with all the money that he has. He follows Jana to Kiev and finally to Odessa on the Black Sea, where he is also reunited with Springer. The movie ends on a ferry as the blue moon rises and the final scene explains the enigmatic opening scene on the Odessa Steps (made famous by The Battleship Potemkin). Dusl sees the love that develops between Johnny and Jana as a metaphor for the relationship between the east and the west. More inspiration for the film may have come from a transatlantic romantic entanglement with an American whom she visited before going into production.Chiari, Valeria.

San Bernardino or San Ber is a town in Paraguay, located on the shores of Ypacarai Lake in the Cordillera Department. It is a popular holiday resort for people from Asunci√≥n, and both Alfredo Stroessner and former Nicaraguan president Anastasio Somoza have had lakehouses there. The town contains a museum, a rathaus, a bierstube and a cemetery that contains the grave of Los Paraguayos singer Luis Alberto del Paran√°. The town was founded in 1881 by German immigrants who named the town New Bavaria. More Germans came from Tanganyika and the Sudetenland after the First World War, though the town was renamed after General Bernardino Caballero, president of Paraguay from 1880 to 1886. The Lake Hotel in San Bernardino was where the German nationalist Dr. Bernhard F√∂rster spent the last six weeks of his life, before committing suicide on 3 June 1889 by taking an overdose of strychnine. Inspired by the writing of Richard Wagner, and because of his own strong anti-semitism, he set out to establish a German settlement in Paraguay with his wife Elisabeth F√∂rster n√©e Nietzsche (sister of the philosopher, Friedrich Nietzsche) and some German families. Their efforts, at a site called Nueva Germania, failed dismally causing F√∂rster to leave for San Bernardino. F√∂rster was buried in the town's cemetery. As Nazism became increasingly popular amongst Paraguay's German community in the 1930s, F√∂rster became something of a hero.

Plot The charismatic criminal Dobermann (Vincent Cassel), who got his first gun when he was christened, leads a gang of brutal robbers with his beautiful, deaf girlfriend Nat the Gypsy (Monica Bellucci). After a complex and brutal bank robbery, they are being hunted by the Paris police. The hunt is led by the sadistic cop Christini (Tch√©ky Karyo), who only has one goal: to catch Dobermann at any cost. He manages to catch gang member Olivier, who is also a tranvestite named Sonia. Christini threatens to kill Olivier's baby if he does not help him to catch the gang. Olivier has no choice and visits a party in a disco where the other gang members celebrate their robbery. He informs Christini with an alarm transmitter that all gang members are here so the police start a raid. After a gun fight the police arrest several members of the gang but some manage to escape, including Dobermann, who flees into a hidden basement which also has monitoring screens to show what happens in the disco. As Christini kills Pitbull and abducts Nat with a car to rape her, Dobermann leaves his hiding place and follows him in a stolen ambulance. He overtakes Christini and manages to wrestle him down in the car. Dobermann grinds the head of Christini on the road while still driving the car at high speed as revenge for the killed friends. Christini is left heavily disfigured on the road, presumably dying. The surviving gang members are able to escape and bury Sonia (the personage), suggesting that her treason results in Olivier having to drop his transvestite role.

Early life Myers was born in Canterbury, Sydney, on 2 August 1930, to a violinist mother and marine wireless operator father. She displayed a talent for art at an early age. The family moved to Box Hill, Melbourne in 1941 and Vali left home at 14. After working in factories to support her dance lessons, she became immersed in dance and later became the leading dancer for the Melbourne Modern Ballet Company. In 1949 at age 19 Myers travelled to impoverished post- war Paris to pursue a dance career but found herself living on the streets of the Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s Quarter on the Left Bank. Love on the Left Bank is a 1954 book of photographs from Dutch photographer Ed van der Elsken (1925‚Äì1990), documenting the bohemian life on the Rive Gauche of Paris; Vali Myers is the heroine of this semi-biographical roman √† clef, and is also photographed along with some of her early drawings. Career Myers was a flamboyant fantasy artist who worked in pen and ink and watercolour as well as being a nightclub dancer. She divided her life between her adopted home of Melbourne, the Hotel Chelsea (New York City), a 14th-century cottage near Il Porto, Italy, and a residence in Paris. Her visionary art works developed from early detailed monochromes to a full range of vibrant colours and tones LUMA Between Dusk and Dawn exhibition review \\"The Enchanted Art and Life of Vali Myers\\", David Mattichak in Other magazine 31 October 2013 extending to watercolour and gold leaf, displaying a \\"fastidiously rendered depiction of a personal spirit world\\".

Myers' paintings have sold for up to $US40,000 ($A68,000) in New York. Her work was held in the Stuyvesant collection in the Netherlands, New York's Hurryman Collection, and is owned by private collectors such as George Plimpton and Mick Jagger. Personal life While in Europe she married Rudi Rappold, an Austrian from Vienna, and moved to Positano. The marriage ended and eventually her lover, Italian artist Gianni Menichetti moved in and helped turn the property into a wildlife sanctuary endorsed by the World Wildlife Fund.Menichetti, Gianni, Vali Myers Memoirs Fresno, CA : Golda Foundation, 2006 : Later, after she began having seizures, she returned to Melbourne in 1993, and opened a studio in the Nicholas Building; only returning to Positano occasionally. Death Vali Myers died in Melbourne on 12 February 2003 shortly after being diagnosed with cancer at the age of 72. On 18 January 2003, a month before Myers' death, The Age newspaper printed an article about her life. The article concluded with the following quote from Myers: > I've had 72 absolutely flaming years. It [the illness] doesn't bother me at > all, because, you know, love, when you've lived like I have, you've done it > all. I put all my effort into living; any dope can drop dead.

Vz is an abbreviation of the Czech (as well as Slovak) term \\"vzor\\" meaning model. History=Design= After the Second World War, Czechoslovakia's Ministry of the Interior requested a new pistol design from ƒåesk√° zbrojovka Uhersk√Ω Brod. The resulting gun was chambered in .32 ACP and designed by two brothers Jan and Jaroslav Kratochv√≠l. It combined elements from both the Walther PP and PPK. The pistol is fed from an 8-round single- stack magazine, located within the bakelite paneled grip. Small fixed sights are located on top of the slide. The pistol functions via the blowback principle - gas pressure from burning powder simultaneously forces the cartridge case and slide backward and forces the bullet forward in the barrel. After it reaches the end of its rearward travel, the recoil spring returns the slide to its forward position, stripping and chambering a new round from the magazine as it does so, rendering the gun ready to fire again. Hammer and trigger operation is single and double action . =Manufacture= Vz. 50s were sold commercially but most were distributed to police agencies under control of the Ministry of the Interior. They were produced initially at Strakonice and later at Uhersk√Ω Brod. Manufacture ended in 1970 with the refinement of the pistol in a new model known as the Vz. 70. Markings=Serial numbers= Serial numbers start at 650001, continuing from the discontinued vz. 27 serial number range. Pistols manufactured at the Strakonice factory fall in the 740000 range. Pistols manufactured at Uhersky Brod have 5 digit serial numbers preceded by a letter (which may change in the middle of a number series). =Date stamp= The last two digits of the year of manufacture are stamped on the left rear of the slide next to the proof stamp (a lion superimposed on an \\"N\\"). =Government property stamp= Vz 50s bearing a stamp of crossed swords indicates they were government property. Variants Vz. 70 (Cz. 70) In 1970, an update of the Vz. 50 was released with minor cosmetic changes and internal improvements called the Vz. 70 (also known as CZ 70). These changes included: * New grip shape with a larger recess (Called the \\"tang\\") for the web between thumb and finger. * Milling on the trigger guard was changed to a more blended merge with the frame, removing sharp angles. * New grip pattern using a grid of dimples instead of grooves. * Top of the slide is engraved with a fine wave pattern to reduce glare. * Serial number is stamped on the slide under the ejection port instead of below and behind it. * Slide serrations are wider and there are more of them. * Take down lever has a cross hatched instead of grooved surface. * Larger hammer with a hole in it. * Smaller magazine release. * Magazines have new base with a more angular and less curved shape * Grip extension via a modified floor- plate on the magazine (for the pinky finger).

Primero de Marzo's name is derived from the date March 1, 1870, when then Paraguayan President Francisco Solano L√≥pez was killed by Brazilian troops at Cerro Cor√°, thereby ending the bloody War of the Triple Alliance. Demographics According to the 2002 National Paraguayan census, Primero de Marzo has a population of 6,019 inhabitants: 3,210 male and 2,809 female. 795 inhabitants live in the urban center of Primero de Marzo while another 5,224 maintain dwellings in the various surrounding rural campos. Some of the larger outlying rural campos include General Diaz, Sargento Cabellero, San Isidro, and Mariscal Estigarribia. Running water and electricity is available to the urban inhabitants, but only some of the rural campos. There are a very few landlines for telephone service in the area.

Processing petitgrain in the rural campo of Sargento Cabellero Economy A rural agricultural area, Primero de Marzo is centered in a region well known for its high-quality production of petitgrain (orange essence) from the bitter orange tree (citrus aurantium). This petitgrain is generally exported to Europe for use in perfumes and skin care products. The vast majority of the harvest, production, and sale of this crop of petitgrain is organized by members of the small credit and marketing cooperative Ni√±o Jesus Ltd. Other important crops in the area include mandioca (yuca), ka'a he'√™ (stevia), watermelon, tomato, pineapple, cotton, and soybeans. Fishfarming production of Tilapia is becoming increasingly important in the rural campos.

The Messapians (; ) were a Iapygian tribe who inhabited Salento in classical antiquity. Two other Iapygian tribes, the Peucetians and the Daunians, inhabited central and northern Apulia respectively. All three tribes spoke the Messapian language, but had developed separate archaeological cultures by the seventh century BC. The Messapians lived in the eponymous region Messapia, which extended from Leuca in the southeast to Kailia and Egnatia in the northwest, covering most of the Salento peninsula. This region includes the Province of Lecce and parts of the provinces of Brindisi and Taranto today. Starting in the third century BC, Greek and Roman writers distinguished the indigenous population of the Salento peninsula differently. According to Strabo, the names Iapygians, Daunians, Peucetians and Messapians were exclusively Greek and not used by the natives, who divided the Salento in two parts. The southern and Ionian part of the peninsula was the territory of the Salentinoi (; ), ranging from Otranto to Leuca and from Leuca to Manduria. The northern part on the Adriatic belonged to the Kalabroi (; ) and extended from Otranto to Egnatia with its hinterland. After the conquest of the Salento by the Roman Republic in 266 BC the distinction between the Iapygian tribes blurred as they were assimilated into ancient Roman society. Strabo makes it clear that in his time, the end of the first century BC, most people used the names Messapia, Iapygia, Calabria and Salentina interchangeably for the Salento. The name Calabria for the entire peninsula was made official when the Roman emperor Augustus divided Italy in regions and gave the whole region of Apulia the name Regio II Apulia et Calabria. Archaeology still follows the original Greek tripartite division of tribes based on the archaeological evidence. Etymology Julius Pokorny derives their ethnonym Messapii from Messapia, interpreted as \\"(the place) Amid waters\\", Mess- from Proto-Indo-European and *mes-, \\"middle\\" cf. Albanian *medhyo-, \\"middle\\" (cf. Ancient Greek ŒºŒ≠œÉŒøœÇ m√©ssos \\"middle\\"), and -apia from Proto-Indo-European *ap-, \\"water\\" (cf. another toponym, Salapia, \\"salt water\\"). History=Origins= Illyrian colonization of Italy (9th century BC).Maggiulli, Sull'origine dei Messapi, 1934; D‚ÄôAndria, Messapi e Peuceti, 1988; I Messapi, Taranto 1991 The origin of the Messapii is debated. The most credited theory is that they came from Illyria as one of the Illyrian tribes who settled in Apulia and that they emerged as a sub-tribe distinct from the rest of the Iapyges. It seems that the Iapyges spread northwards from the Salento.Kathryn Lomas, \\"Cities, states and ethnic identity in southeast Italy\\" E. Herring and K. Lomas (eds), The Emergence of State Identities in Italy in the First Millennium BC (London, 2000).Talbert, Richard J. A. Atlas of Classical History. Routledge, 1985, , p. 85. \\"...from Illyrians, known as Iapyges, who settled first in the heel of Italy and then spread north...\\" The pre-Italic settlement of Gnatia was founded in the fifteenth century BC during the Bronze Age. It was captured and settled by the Iapyges, as they occupied large tracts of territory in Apulia. The Messapii developed a distinct identity from the Iapyges. Rudiae was first settled from the late ninth or early eighth centuries BC. In the late sixth century BC, it developed into a much more important settlement. It flourished under the Messapii, but after their defeat by Rome it dwindled and became a small village. The nearby Lupiae (Lecce) flourished at its expense. The Messapi did not have a centralised form of government. Their towns were independent city-states. They had trade relationships with the Greek cities of Magna Graecia. =Conflict with Taras= In 473 BC, the Greek city of Tarentum (which was on the border with Messapia) and its ally, Rhegion, tried to seize some of the towns of the Messapii and Peucetii. However, the Iapyge tribes defeated them thanks to the superiority of their cavalry.Herodotus, The Histories, 7. 170 The war against Tarentum continued until 467 BC. During the Second Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta, the Mesapii were allies of Athens. They provided archers for Athens' massive expeditionary force sent to attack Syracuse in Sicily (415‚Äì13 BC). The expedition was a disaster and the entire force was destroyed. In 356 BC, an alliance between Messapii and Lucani led to the conquest of Heraclea and Matapontus. In 342 BC, Tarentum called for the aid of Archidamus III of Sparta. Archidamus died in battle under the walls of the Messapian city of Manduria in 338 BC.Diodoro Siculus, Library of History, 16.63 In 333 BC, Tarentum called Alexander I of Epirus to help them in their war with their Lucani. Alexander defeated the Messapii. He died in a battle against the Lucani in 330 BC.Arrian of Nicomedia, The Anabasis of Alexander, 3.6 After the campaign of Alexander I, the Messapii switched allegiance. They allied with Tarentum and Cleonymus of Sparta, who campaigned in the region in 303‚Äì02 BC to help Tarentum against, again, the Lucani.Diodorus Siculus, The Library of History, 12.4 =Conquest by the Roman Republic= During the Second Samnite War (327‚Äì304 BC) between Rome and the Samnites, the Messapii, Iapyges and Peucetii sided with the Samnites. Some of the cities of the Dauni sided with Rome and some of them sided with the Samnites. The city of Canusium went over to the Romans in 318 BC. Silvium, a Peucetii frontier town, was under Samnite control, but it was captured by Rome in 306 BC. During the Pyrrhic Wars (280‚Äì275 BC), the Messapii sided with Tarentum and Pyrrhus the king of Epirus, in GreecePlutarch, Parallel Lives, The life of Pyrrhus, 13.5‚Äì6, 15.4‚Äì5, who landed at Tarentum, ostensibly to help this city in her conflict with the Romans. According to ancient historians, his aim was to conquer Italy. Pyrrhus fought battles against the Romans and a campaign in Sicily. He had to give up the latter and was defeated by the Romans and left Italy. The Messapii were mentioned by Dionysius of Halicarnassus as fighting for Pyrrhus in the Battle of Asculum.Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities, 20.1.1‚Äì6, 8 In 272 BC, the Romans captured Tarentum. In 267 BC, Rome conquered the Messapii and Brundisium.Zonaras, Extracts of History, 8.7Florus, Epitome of Roman History, 15 This city became Rome's port for sailing to the eastern Mediterranean. Subsequently, the Messapii were rarely mentioned in the historical record. They became Romanised. In 217 BC, Hydra started issuing coins, which often featured Iapagus, the legendary founder of the Iapyges. During Hannibal's invasion of Italy in the Second Punic War (218‚Äì201 BC), the Messapii remained loyal to the Romans. The Battle of Cannae, where Hannibal routed the forces of the Romans and their Italic allies, was fought in the heart of the neighbouring Peucetii territory. The Roman survivors were welcomed into nearby Canusium. Part of the final stages of the war were fought out at Monte Gargano, in the northernmost part of Apulia, in the territory of the Dauni. Language and writing The Messapian language is generally considered similar to the Illyrian languages, although this has been debated as a mostly speculative grouping, as Illyrian languages are themselves poorly attested. Albanian dialects are still a relatable group with Messapian, due to toponyms in Apulia, some of towns that have no etymological forms outside Albanian linguistic sources. The language became extinct following the Roman conquest of the region, which began during the late 4th century BC. It has been preserved in about 300 inscriptions written in the Greek alphabet and dating from the 6th to the 1st century BC. Geography Messapia was relatively urbanized and more densely populated compared to the rest of Iapygia.

Before his rise to kingship, he served as a commander of his predecessor, Vonones, who had minted coins with his name and that of another commander, Spalirisos, who are both referred to as \\"brother of the king\\". Scholars such as R.C. Senior and Khodadad Rezakhani consider Spalahores and Spalirisos to indeed be Vonones' brothers, while others such as K.W. Dobbins argue that it was an honorific title given to them, whom he considered to be Saka satraps. A major argument against the proposal of a blood relationship between Vonones and the two commanders was due to both of them having Saka names, contrary to Vonones' Parthian name. Saghi Gazerani has suggested that after the Arsacid re-conquest of Sakastan (sometime between 124‚Äì115 BC), which was given as a fiefdom to the Surenid general that led the expedition, the Surenids (who became independent after 88 BC) and Sakas became closely connected, presumably through alliances and intermarriages. Indeed, Parthians and Sakas are often mixed up in Indian literature. The mythological Iranian hero Rostam (who was from Sakastan), is mentioned in Iranian traditions as both Parthian and Saka, thus supporting this dual-identity. Spalahores' son and successor, Spalagadames, has been suggested by Rezakhani to be the same figure as the first Indo-Parthian king Gondophares ().

He was born in Nicosia on 19 September 1969. His artistic family, with a painter father and poet brother was a source of inspiration for him. He first wanted to study drums, but couldn't due to the lack of a drum teacher in Nicosia. Instead, he studied guitar. For the first 20 years of his life, he lived in a Nicosia suburb. After his military service, he went off to Greece to study theatre. He also entered the School of Philosophy, University of Athens, which he later gave up. He was more successful in his theatre studies where he played some major roles in well known Greek tragedies such as Alcestis. At the age of 23 he recorded his first album called Stin Agora Tou Kosmou (Greek: Œ£œÑŒ∑ŒΩ ŒëŒ≥ŒøœÅŒ¨ Œ§ŒøœÖ ŒöœåœÉŒºŒøœÖ, In The World's Market) with lyrics and music written by Nikos Zoudiaris. This demo tape eventually reached the hands of a well known singer, Dimitra Galani. She instantly became fond of their music and Alkinoos' voice and helped them get a record deal. Alkinoos and Zoudiaris followed with another album called Opos Mistika Kai Isicha (Greek: ŒüœÄœâœÇ ŒúœÖœÉœÑŒπŒ∫Œ¨ ŒöŒ±Œπ ŒâœÉœÖœáŒ±, As Secretly and Quietly). Both albums turned gold. From 1993 to 1997 he toured frequently in support of other artists, including one of the most important female figures of Greek music, Eleftheria Arvanitaki.

The cover to was painted by his father. His subsequent albums have also had their covers painted by his father. In 1999 he released another self-penned album, Anemodiktis (Greek: ŒëŒΩŒµŒºŒøŒ¥ŒµŒØŒ∫œÑŒ∑œÇ, Weather Vane). In 2000 he released a double-disc live album Ektos Topou kai Xronou (Greek: ŒïŒ∫œÑœåœÇ œÑœåœÄŒøœÖ Œ∫Œ±Œπ œáœÅœåŒΩŒøœÖ, Out of Space and Time).

Painting by Jean de Court. Les Mignons (from mignon, French for \\"the darlings\\" or \\"the dainty ones\\") was a term used by polemicists in the toxic atmosphere of the French Wars of Religion and taken up by the people of Paris, to designate the favourites of Henry III of France, from his return from Poland to reign in France in 1574, to his assassination in 1589, a disastrous end to which the perception of effeminate weakness contributed.Katherine B. Crawford, \\"Love, Sodomy, and Scandal: Controlling the Sexual Reputation of Henry III\\", Journal of the History of Sexuality 12.4 (October 2003:513‚Äì542. The mignons were frivolous and fashionable young men, to whom public malignity attributed heterodox sexuality, rumors that some historians have found to be a factor in the disintegration of the late Valois monarchy. History According to the contemporary chronicler Pierre de l'Estoile,L'Estoile, Madeleine Lazard and Gilbert Schrenck, eds. Registre- Journal du R√®gne d'Henri III, vol. 3: 1579‚Äì81, 4: 1582‚Äì84 (Geneva: Droz) 2000; L'Estoile's Registre was carefully crafted in retrospect, from his notes. they made themselves \\"exceedingly odious, as much by their foolish and haughty demeanour, as by their effeminate and immodest dress, but above all by the immense gifts the king made to them.\\" The Joyeuse wedding in 1581 occasioned one of the most extravagant displays of the reign. The faction of the Malcontents, headed by Fran√ßois, duc d'Alen√ßon, created duc d'Anjou in 1576‚Äî the presumed heir as long as Henry remained childless‚Äî appear to have stirred up the ill will of the Parisians against them. From 1576 the mignons were attacked by popular opinion, and some historians have credited without proof the scandalous stories of the time. Some fourteen favourites were singled out, including Fran√ßois d'Espinay, seigneur de Saint-Luc, who had accompanied Henry to his \\"exile\\" in Poland and was rewarded now with the ch√¢teau de Rozoy-en- Brie and the governorship of Brouage; but the best known of the mignons, the archimignons in L'Estoile's Registre-Journal, who monopolised access to the king after the death of Henri's brother and heir the duc d'Alen√ßon were Anne de Joyeuse, baron d'Arques, created duc de Joyeuse (died 1587) and Jean Louis de Nogaret de La Valette, created duc d'√âpernon. Contemporary portrait drawing of Louis de Maugiron The appearance of the mignons on Henry's visits in July 1576 to the parishes of Paris to raise money to pay for the provisions of the Edict of Beaulieu (1576), occasioned a report by L'√âstoile: :\\"The name Mignons began, at this time, to travel by word of mouth through the people, to whom they were very odious, as much for their ways which were jesting and haughty as for their paint [make-up] and effeminate and unchaste apparel...Their occupations are gambling, blaspheming... fornicating and following the King everywhere...seeking to please him in everything they do and say, caring little for God or virtue, contenting themselves to be in the good graces of their master, whom they fear and honor more than God.\\"Quoted in Crawford 2003:524. L'√âstoile added \\"they wear their hair long, curled and recurled by artifice, with little bonnets of velvet on top of it like whores in the brothels, and the ruffles on their linen shirts are of starched finery and one half foot long so that their heads look like St. John's on a platter.\\" The figure of Ganymede was employed in scurrilous sonnetry,Joseph Cady, \\"The 'Masculine Love' of the 'Princes of Sodom': 'Practicing the Art of Ganymede' at Henri III's court\\", in Jacqueline Murray and Konrad Eisenbichler, eds., Desire and Discipline: Sex and Sexuality in the Premodern West (University of Toronto Press) 1996. but the subtext of criticism within the court was most often that the mignons were not drawn from the cream of noble families, as had been the court favourites of his late brother Francis II or their father Henry II, but from the secondary nobility, raised up to such a degree that the social fabric appeared to be unnaturally strained.The contrast with court favorites of the preceding reigns, such as Anne de Montmorency, is examined by Nicolas Le Roux, La faveur du roi: Mignons et courtisans au temps des derniers Valois (Seyssel) 2001. =The Duel of the Mignons= In April 1578, the rival court parties of Henry III and Henry, Duke of Guise decided to reenact the battle of the Horatii and the Curiatii. On 27 April, Jacques de Caylus, Louis de Maugiron and Jean d'Arc√®s (representing the party of the King) engaged in a mock battle with Charles de Balzac, Rib√©rac, and Georges de Schomberg (representing the party of the Guises). Maugiron and Schomberg were killed in the fighting, Rib√©rac died of wounds the following noon, d'Arc√®s was wounded in the head and convalesced in a hospital for six weeks, while Caylus sustained as many as 19 wounds and died after 33 days of agony. Only Balzac got off with a mere scratch on his arm. This meaningless loss of life impressed itself on the public imagination. Jean Passerat wrote an elegy, Plaintes de Cl√©ophon, on the occasion. In the political treatise Le Theatre de France (1580) the duel was invoked as \\"the day of the pigs\\" who \\"killed each other in the precinct of Saint Paul, serving him in the Muscovite manner\\".Quoted by Nicolas Le Roux in La faveur du roi: mignons et courtisans au temps des derniers Valois. Champ Vallon, 2001. . Page 388. Michel Montaigne decried the event as \\"an image de cowardice\\", and Pierre Brant√¥me connected it with the deplorable spread of the Italian and Gascon manners at Henry's court. The incident accelerated the estrangement between the two Henrys.

It is designed to scrape the contents of long bottles that would be impossible to reach with other kitchen tools. Although the tool is sold in Norway and has even been described in some accounts as having originated there, it is cited as a quintessentially Dutch tool as well as an example of Dutch thrift. The scraper is made of a long shaft, frequently around in length. On one side is a small flexible rubber spatula head roughly across set perpendicular to the shaft. The head is flexible and usually has a rounded half-circle shape one side useful for scraping round bottles and jars and a flat side with two right angles useful for scraping out cartons. The head is flexible so that it can be pushed into and pulled out of bottles whose mouth is smaller than the fully expanded head of the scraper but larger than the shaft. It is a common tool in kitchens in the Netherlands and available in many kitchen stores and supermarkets ‚Äî although this may vary by region. It is almost entirely unused and unknown outside of that country. Historically, vla (a popular dairy product with the consistency similar to custard or yoghurt) was sold in long glass bottles. Vla was frequently delivered by milkmen in bottles similar to the long, tapered-neck milk bottles used in many places in the world. However, while the use of the milk bottle streamlined production and distribution practices, the shape of the container made it hard to extract the last bits with spoons, spatulas, or other kitchen utensils. The Dutch answer was the bottle scraper which was perfectly suited to answer this problem. Vla is now primarily sold in cartons which reduces the need for a bottle scraper or make the design less efficient (e.g., bottles have rounded walls while cartons frequently have square bases with 90 degree angles). Modern bottle scrapers include a spatula-side with right angles useful for scraping vla out of these containers as well. Additionally, the scraper has come to occupy an important role in Dutch kitchens in variety of other purposes being used for scraping the contents of many other bottles and jars (e.g., peanut butter, Nutella, etc.). Much of the Dutch population is familiar with the bottle scraper and skilled in its use. There is an element of the technical and engineering community that sees the bottle scraper as a monument to a wrong type of technical solution. This group argues that the best solution to the problem of remaining vla in bottles was to put vla in different containers preventing the problem from ever occurring, rather than inventing another tool and then educating a population in its use. full size scraper External links * Flessenschraper, \\"...one of the coolest kitchen gadgets that you've never heard of...\\"  References  Category:Cooking utensils ","title":"Bottle scraper"},{"id":"2293148","text":"Hursley House Hursley House is an 18th-century Queen Anne style mansion in Hursley, near Winchester in the English county of Hampshire. The building is Grade II* listed. History The Hursley estate was bought by William Heathcote, MP from the daughters of Richard Cromwell. Cromwell had acquired the estate by marriage to the daughter of Richard Major, MP. Heathcote commissioned the present house to be built between 1721 and 1724, during the reign of George I, and was created a baronet in 1733. The estate descended in the Heathcote family to the 5th Baronet, whose widow sold it after his death in 1881 to Joseph Baxendale, the owner of the Pickfords logistics and removal company. He sold it in 1902 to Sir George Cooper whose wife, Mary Emma Smith, an American railways heiress from Chicago,Gail MacColl and Carol McD. Wallace, To Marry an English Lord, 2012:275 commissioned architect Alexander Marshall Mackenzie to carry out extensive development work in 1902 to create the house that can be seen today. Sir George was created a baronet in 1905. During the First World War the second floor of the house was made available as a nursing hospital for officers. It was intended to turn it over again as a military hospital during the Second World War but Sir George died in 1940 and it was requisitioned instead by the Ministry of Aircraft Production (MAP) to rehouse the Design and Production departments of Vickers Supermarine, which had been bombed out of its original premises in Woolston, Hampshire. During its time in the House, Supermarine worked on the development of many aircraft, of which the most famous is the Spitfire but also includes the early Jet fighters like the Attacker, Swift and Scimitar. IBM Hursley \\"A\\" block, one of several modern buildings added to the estate as part of the IBM Hursley development laboratory In 1958 IBM started using the House and its grounds as development laboratories. In 1963 IBM purchased the 100 acres (405,000 m¬≤) of surrounding land and have since erected a large modern office complex employing over 1500 people. The original house is still used by IBM as an Executive Briefing Centre.

It can be prepared by boiling in water a suspension of poorly soluble calcium hydroxide (lime) and solid sulfur together with a small amount of surfactant to facilitate the dispersion of these solids in water. After elimination of any residual solids (flocculation, decantation and filtration), it is normally used as an aqueous solution, which is reddish-yellow in colour and has a distinctive offensive odour of hydrogen sulfide (H2S, rotten eggs). Synthesis reaction The exact chemical reaction leading to the synthesis of lime sulfur is poorly known and is generally written as: : : where x = 2‚Äì8 and x value is often found around 5, calcium pentasulfide, a polysulfide as reported in a document of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA).USDA: Lime sulfur evaluation for crops, accessed on 01 May 2020 This vague reaction is puzzling because it involves the reduction of elemental sulfur and no reductant appears in the above mentioned equation while sulfur oxidation products are also mentioned. The initial pH of the solution imposed by poorly soluble hydrated lime is alkaline (pH = 12.5) while the final pH is in range 11‚Äì12, typical for sulfides which are also strong bases. However, elemental sulfur can undergo a disproportionation reaction, also called dismutation. The here above reaction resembles a disproportionation reaction. The inverse comproportionation reaction is the reaction occurring in the Claus process used for desulfurisation of oil and gas crude products in the refining industry. Claus process: :2 H2S + 3 O2 ‚Üí 2 SO2 \\\\+ 2 H2O :4 H2S + 2 SO2 ‚Üí 3 S2 \\\\+ 4 H2O By rewriting the last reaction in the inverse direction one obtains a reaction consistent with what is observed in the lime sulfur global reaction: :3 S2 \\\\+ 4 H2O ‚Üí 4 H2S + 2 SO2 In alkaline conditions, it gives: :3 S2 \\\\+ 4 H2O + 12 OH‚Äì ‚Üí 4 S2‚Äì \\\\+ 2 SO32‚Äì \\\\+ 10 H2O and after simplification, or more exactly recycling, of water molecules in the above reaction: :3 S2 \\\\+ 12 OH‚Äì ‚Üí 4 S2‚Äì \\\\+ 2 SO32‚Äì \\\\+ 6 H2O adding back 6 Ca2+ cations from hydrated lime for the sake of electroneutrality, one obtains the global reaction. Lime sulfur reaction: :3 S2 \\\\+ 6 Ca(OH)2 ‚Üí 4 CaS + 2 CaSO3 \\\\+ 6 H2O This last reaction is consistent with the global lime sulfur reaction mentioned in the USDA document. However, it does not account of all the details, a.o., the production of thiosulfate and sulfate amongst the end- products of the reaction. Meanwhile, it is a good first order approximation and it usefully highlights the overall lime sulfur reaction scheme because the chemistry of reduced or partially oxidized forms of sulfur is particularly complex and all the intermediate steps or involved mechanisms are hard to unravel. Moreover, once exposed to atmospheric oxygen and microbial activity, the lime sulfur system will undergo a fast oxidation and its different products will continue to evolve and finally enter the natural sulfur cycle. The presence of thiosulfate in the lime sulfur reaction can be accounted by the reaction between sulfite and elemental sulfur (or with sulfide and polysulfides) and that of sulfate by the complete oxidation of sulfite or thiosulfate following a more complex reaction scheme. More information on calcium thiosulfate production has been described in a patent registered by Hajjatie et al. (2006).Hajjatie M.M., III H.C.K., Aspengren M.D., Clarkson M.P., Lockhart C.L.F. (2006). Sulfiding calcium hydroxide with sulfur to form calcium polysulfide, cooling to oxidation, filtering to get a pure concentrate clarity product; by-product inhibition, efficiency; optional starting material calcium oxide. Patent # US6984368 B2. Retrieved October 16, 2014 from http://www.google.com/patents/US6984368. Hajjatie et al. (2006) wrote the lime sulfur reaction in various ways depending on the degree of polymerisation of calcium polysulfides, but the following reaction is probably the simplest of their series: : :where the S22‚Äì species corresponds to the disulfide anion ‚ÄìS‚ÄìS‚Äì (with a covalent bond between the 2 sulfur atoms) also present in pyrite (FeS2), a Fe(II) disulfide mineral. They also managed to successfully control this reaction to achieve the conversion of elemental sulfur in a quasi pure solution of calcium thiosulfate.  Preparation of lime sulfur  A New York State Agricultural Experiment Station recipe for the concentrate is 80 lb. of sulfur, 36 lb. of quicklime, and 50 gal. Transferring this formula to the metric system and using a total volume as 100 L of purified water to this we will add 19.172 kg of sulphur and 8.627 kg of calcium hydroxide. About 2.2:1 is the ratio (by weight) for compounding sulfur and quicklime; this makes the highest proportion of calcium pentasulfide. If calcium hydroxide (builders or hydrated lime) is used, an increase by 1/3 or more (to 115 g/L or more) might be used with the 192 g/L of sulfur. If the quicklime is 85 %, 90 %, or 95 % pure, use 101 g/L, 96 g/L, or 91 g/L; if impure hydrated lime is used, similarly increase its quantity. Avoid using lime that is less than 90 % pure. Boil for an hour, stirring and adding small amounts of hot water to compensate for evaporation.  Use  Lime sulfur is sold as a spray for deciduous trees to control fungi, bacteria and insects living or dormant on the surface of the bark. Lime sulfur burns leaves and so cannot be sprayed on evergreen plants or on plants still bearing green leaves in the high seasons. Bonsai enthusiasts use undiluted lime sulfur to bleach, sterilise, and preserve deadwood on bonsai trees while giving an aged look.The Bonsai Primer: Jin and Sharimiki Rather than spraying the entire tree, as with the pesticidal usage, lime sulfur is painted directly onto the exposed deadwood, and is often colored with a small amount of dark paint to make it look more natural. Without paint pigments, the lime-sulfur solution bleaches wood to a bone-white color that takes time to weather and become natural-looking. In the very specific case of the bonsai culture, if the lime sulfur is carefully and very patiently applied by hand with a small brush and does not enter into direct contact with the leaves or needles, this technique can be used on evergreen bonsai trees as well as other types of green trees. However, this does not apply for a normal use on common trees with green leaves. Diluted solutions of lime sulfur (between 1:16 and 1:32) are also used as a dip for pets to help control ringworm (fungus), mange and other dermatoses and parasites. Undiluted lime sulfur is corrosive to skin and eyes and can cause serious injury like blindness.  Safety  Lime sulfur reacts with strong acids (including stomach acid) to produce highly toxic hydrogen sulfide (rotten egg gas) and indeed usually has a distinct \\"rotten egg\\" odor to it. Lime sulfur is not extremely flammable but combustion produces highly irritating sulfur dioxide gas. Safety goggles and impervious gloves must be worn while handling lime sulfur. Lime sulfur solutions are strongly alkaline (typical commercial concentrates have a pH over 11.5 because of the presence of dissolved sulfides and hydroxide anions), and are harmful for living organisms and can cause blindness if splashed in the eyes. The corrosive nature of lime sulfur is due to the reduced species of sulfur it contains, in particular the sulfides responsible for stress corrosion cracking and the thiosulphates causing pitting corrosion. Localised corrosion by the reduced species of sulfur can be dramatic, even the mere presence of elemental sulfur in contact with metals is enough to corrode them considerably, including so-called stainless steels.  History  Lime sulfur is believed to be the earliest synthetic chemical used as a pesticide, being used in the 1840s in France to control grape vine powdery mildew Uncinula necator, which had been introduced from the USA in 1845 and reduced wine production by 80%. In 1886 it was first used in California to control San Jose scale. Commencing around 1904, commercial suppliers began to manufacturer lime sulfur; prior to that time, gardeners were expected to manufacture their own. By the 1920s essentially all commercial orchards in western countries were protected by regular spraying with lime sulfur. However by the 1940s, lime sulfur began to be replaced by synthetic organic fungicides which risked less damage to the crop's foliage.

History  San Estanislao was founded on November 13, 1749 by Father Sebasti√°n de Yegros, a Jesuit priest from Asunci√≥n after Saint Stanislaus Kostka. The town was founded as a Jesuit mission with the goal of converting the surrounding Indian population. The city is named for Stanis≈Çaw Kostka, a Polish priest who was canonized by Pope Benedict XIII on November 13, 1726, 23 years before San Estanislao was founded. Santan√≠, as the city is commonly referred to locally and throughout Paraguay, is a contraction of the word for saint in Spanish (\\"san\\") and the word for Estanislao in Guaran√≠ (\\"tan√≠\\"). People from Santan√≠ are referred to as \\"santanianos\\" in Spanish. In 1869, during the Paraguayan War, San Estanislao was briefly the seat of the national government under Marshall Francisco Solano L√≥pez. Following battles elsewhere in Paraguay, L√≥pez and several of his regiments passed through the city. L√≥pez governed from the city from August 23 to 31.  Immigration to San Estanislao  Around 1880, San Estanislao became home to immigrants both from other parts of Paraguay and from Europe, especially from Germany and Italy. The influence of the Italian immigrants, in particular, can still be seen today in various buildings in Italian styles and the last names of some of the oldest Santaniana families. Decades later, around 1920, Santan√≠ also received immigrants from Lebanon. After arriving at Itacurub√≠ del Rosario, some of the new arrivals made their way to Santan√≠. Other countries that sent relatively large numbers of immigrants to the city were France, Portugal, Brazil and Spain.  Economy  After 1870, during the postwar period, Santan√≠ and the surrounding countryside were sustained mostly through agriculture and forestry. Tobacco was the major crop, and its production and packaging for export were a main contributor of jobs. Today the primary economic activity continues to be agriculture, especially cotton, mandioca, soy and sesame. Beef and milk production, forestry, commerce, and regional services (medical treatment, banking, and construction) also contribute to the city's economy.  Education  San Estanislao is home to schools ranging from primary- to university-level, both public and private. In 1994 a College of Economic Sciences was established in the city as part of the UNA. There are more than 10 universities in downtown Santani.  Transportation  Travel time between San Estanislao and Asunci√≥n (151 km away) was greatly reduced with the inauguration of Route 3 in May 2004. Buses leave the terminal to Asuncion every half an hour.  Night Life  Santani is a college town, and its many plazas come to life after 9pm when students get out of class. Sidewalk cafes serve pizza and beer from 6pm to midnight, and hamburger stands stay open all night. It is common for people to cruise the strip slowly on their motorcycles, beer in hand and music blasting. There is one karaoke bar called \\"La Rustica\\" which turns into a dance club after 12 or 12:30am. The bartender/DJ plays everything from cumbia to reggaeton to Brazilian music and reggae.

Pietro Micca on the verge of igniting the powder keg consecrates his last thoughts to God and Country. 1858. One of the most famous depictions of Micca Pietro MiccaGariglio, Dario. 1706, l'assedio di Torino. Blu Edizioni, Turin (2005), p. 129. (6 March 1677 ‚Äì 30 August 1706), also known as Pierre Micha, was a Sabaudian soldier who became a national hero for his sacrifice in the defence of Turin against the French troops. Early life Micca was born at Andorno, now Andorno Micca, Piedmont, near the town of Biella. His mother was Anna Martinazzo, of Riabella. In his home village, he worked as a bricklayer. Micca was enlisted into the Sabaudian army as a sapper, with the rank of a private soldier; he was nicknamed Passepartout.Storia Militare: Pietro Micca Military action and death During the siege of Turin, Micca was employed as a tunneller and bricklayer in the military mines, which ran under the citadel. The mines were designed to detect Franco-Spanish attempts to dig under the citadel and to neutralize them by blowing them up. For this purpose, barrels of gunpowder were placed in strategic places around the network of mines. On the night of 29‚Äì30 August 1706, a party of French grenadiers crept into a large trench, which had been the site of a failed assault on the citadel. The Piemontese had lit bonfires in the trench to burn dead bodies, and this meant that the French grenadiers were not observed. The French grenadiers attacked a small number of Savoyard soldiers at the base of the trench, who were guarding an entrance to the Savoyard mines. The French grenadiers killed them and entered the upper level of the mines. On hearing the French attack, Micca and a comrade barred a door at the top of the steps leading down to the lower level of the mines. As the French grenadiers attempted to break down the door, Micca sent away his comrade, lit a very short fuse and placed it in two barrels of gunpowder behind the door. The gunpowder exploded as the French grenadiers broke down the door, killing and injuring most of them. Micca was severely injured in the explosion and died due to his injuries and poisonous carbon dioxide gas, which had been released by the exploding gunpowder. Had the French grenadiers reached the lower level of the mines, they could have entered the heart of the citadel and the city itself. Micca's sacrifice prevented this, and the French assault was repulsed with heavy losses. A few days later, the steps where Micca had exploded the bomb were quickly bricked over. Micca's body was buried in a mass grave. Memorial and archaeology Monument to Pietro Micca in Turin In 1958, Captain (later General) Guido Amoretti discovered the bricked- up 'Pietro Micca steps' and these form the centre-piece of the network of military mines, which can be visited at the Museo Civico Pietro Micca (the Civic Museum of Pietro Micca and the siege of Turin). The remnants of the attackers' grenades, knives and other personal equipment were discovered, and are displayed at the museum. Micca's heroism has been the subject of poems, plays and romances. But, according to Count Giuseppe Solaro della Margherita, the commander of the Turin garrison at the time, it was through a miscalculation of the pace of the fuse, and not by deliberate intent, that he sacrificed his life. As well as the Museo Civico Pietro Micca, a central street in Turin was named after him, and a statue erected in his honour. His home town was renamed from Andorno to Andorno Micca.

It has the honour of being possibly the only golf course with both tram and trains running through it: the route 58 tram and Upfield railway line (Royal Adelaide Golf Club only has a railway line running through it). The Royal Park Golf Club, formed in 1903, has been the nursery for many golfers who went on to make a mark in the golfing world, including Peter Thomson (club champion at the age of 16, in 1945) who won the Open Championship (sometimes known as the British Open) 5 times, as well as Gus Jackson and Mick Ryan.  History  Between the years of 1890 and 1903 golf was played in Royal Park, Melbourne, but without a proper golf course. It wasn't until 1903 that a group of golf enthusiasts met at the Parkville Hotel to discuss forming a club. For a nominal rent, sufficient land for an 18-hole course was obtained from the Royal Park Trustees and the Royal Park Golf Course was built and maintained by volunteers and club members. Membership numbers had fallen so low by 1911 that members could not afford the upkeep on the 18-hole course and it was reduced to 9 holes. But that didn't stop the junior pennant team winning all its matches 8 years later in 1919 to win the flag. The members made small improvements to the course, with approval from the Royal Park Trustees. In 1934 control of Royal Park changed from the Trustees to the Melbourne City Council (City of Melbourne). Immediate improvements to the golf course included mowing of the fairways and bunkers and mounds being added to the course layout. Royal Park has been the mother club for many notable golfers who went on to make their mark in the golfing world. These include: * A. W. (Gus) Jackson (1926 and 1933 Victorian Amateur title, amongst other titles), * M. J. (Mick) Ryan (1930 and 1932 Victorian Amateur Championships, 1939 Australian Amateur title, Australian Open Championship in 1939, amongst other titles) * Peter Thomson (1948 Victorian Amateur title, 1951 Australian Open title, and 5 Open Championships amongst other titles). The clubhouse, built on land leased from the Victorian Railways Department from 1906 onwards, was renovated and maintained by club members until 1970 when it was destroyed by fire. Permission to rebuild the clubhouse proved difficult with the condition of occupancy offered by the Council being rejected by club members, so after talks with the Keilor Golf Club the club disbanded and the two clubs merged into the Tullamarine Country Club. The council took over the running of the course from March 1971, and in the mid-1980s hired Peter Thomson's firm of Golf Course Architects to improve the course layout. The Club reformed in 1974 with an 18-hole competition played on Saturdays and a 9-hole competition on Sundays. This was reversed in 1976 and by 1989 competitions days were Sundays only. Members were allowed to use part of the restaurant built by council, to be used as a clubhouse. By 2002 a Saturday 9-hole competition was reintroduced and renovations to pro-shop and clubhouse were undertaken by council, including the addition of a verandah. Membership numbers at the end of 2002 were close to 80, including juniors and 3 women, one being the first committee member in the hundred-year history of the club. The Club celebrated its 100th year in 2003 with a Centenary Weekend of Golf tournament, with Peter Thomson returning to the Club to present prizes to Club winners. Peter also wrote the foreword to the book of the Club's history, written by Club member and first female committee member.

Brief history Kond≈ç was born in Gosen, Niigata Prefecture, Japan on March 31, 1950. He entered Niigata Prefectural Muramatsu High School in April, 1965, where he was a member of the art club. His senpai was the future manga artist Kimio Yanagisawa. In April, 1968, he moved to Tokyo after graduating from high school, where he entered Tokyo Design College's animation department. On October 1, 1968, he began working at A Production (formerly Shin'ei D≈çga), participating in the production of such shows as Kyojin no Hoshi and Lupin III. Kondo moved to Nippon Animation in June 1978, participating in the production of such shows as Future Boy Conan and Anne of Green Gables. In 1978, he co-authored a textbook for beginning animators titled Animation Book („Ç¢„Éã„É°„Éº„Ç∑„Éß„É≥„ÅÆÊú¨ Animƒìshon no Hon). He moved to Telecom Animation Film on December 16, 1980, where he worked as the character designer for Sherlock Hound.

The species is endemic to Western Asia. Geographic range Z. persicus is found in temperate northwestern Iran and Azerbaijan, in the area near the Caspian Sea. Description Adults of Z. persicus are from up to in total length (including tail), and usually jet black or grey with white markings along the lateral portion of the forebody. Males seem to grow larger than females. Taxonomy Z. persicus has habits very similar to Z. situla and for many years it was considered a subspecies of Elaphe longissima. It was granted full species status in 1984 (Nilson and Andr√©n). Behavior The Persian ratsnake is principally regarded as a terrestrial species, spending most of its time in the leaf litter; however, it is also an agile climber and will mount low brush. Diet The diet of Z. persicus, like that of most colubrids, consists primarily of small mammals, but it may also eat other small reptiles and amphibians. Reproduction Sexually mature female Persian ratsnakes lay clutches of 4-8 eggs, which hatch after 45‚Äì55 days of incubation. In captivity For Z. persicus, a hibernation period of 2‚Äì3 months is recommended. ReferencesFurther reading *Werner F.

Dyer played in six Tests and 23 ODIs from 1986 to 1988, including playing in the victorious 1987 World Cup Final. He toured India in 1986 as a back-up keeper. Dyer replaced Tim Zoehrer for only a few Tests as his international career was cut short by the emergence of Ian Healy, along with a controversial incident in a Test match against New Zealand in 1987-88. Dyer claimed to have \\"caught\\" New Zealand batsman Andrew Jones who was duly given out, although television replays showed the ball had touched the ground before being caught by Dyer. He was subsequently dropped from the team two matches later and retired from first-class cricket shortly thereafter. He shares an Australian One Day International 7th-wicket partnership record with Steve Waugh. In 2011, Dyer became the president of the Australian Cricketers Association. Career Dyer played for NSW and Australian Under 19 sides, and for NSW colts. He became New South Wales' preferred back up keeper for Steve Rixon when Rixon was injured or was busy on international duty. Notably, Dyer played several games in 1984-85 when NSW won the Sheffield Shield. When Rixon signed to tour in South Africa, Dyer became New South Wales' first choice wicketkeeper. He was a crucial part of the side which won the Shield again in 1985-86. =1986 Tour of India= Australia's wicketkeeper over the 1985-86 summer was Wayne Phillips, but his form dropped away and Tim Zoehrer was appointed in his place. Dyer was unofficially announced next in line when selected as a reserve keeper on the 1986 tour to India. Dyer performed strongly in tour games but Zoehrer was first choice keeper for the three test matches. He played in some one day games, making his ODI debut in the third game.http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/16783/scorecard/64287/India-vs- Australia-3rd-ODI-australia-tour-of-india-1986-87/ In the fourth ODI he came to the wicket when Australia was 6-136 and he and Steve Waugh put on a 102 run stand off 76 balls.http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/16783/scorecard/64288/India-vs- Australia-4th-ODI-australia-tour-of-india-1986-87/ He played in the 5thhttp://www.espncricinfo.com/series/16783/scorecard/64289/India-vs- Australia-5th-ODI-australia-tour-of-india-1986-87/ and 6th ODI.http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/16783/scorecard/64290/India-vs- Australia-6th-ODI-australia-tour-of-india-1986-87/ Dyer also scored a century against Delhi in a tour game. =1986-87 Test debut= Dyer made his test debut during the third test of the 1986-87 Ashes when Zoehrer was injured. Dyer broke his nose during the game but kept playing. He was not required to bat in the game, which was a run-heavy draw.http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/16779/scorecard/63446/Australia-vs- England-3rd-Test-england-tour-of-australia-1986-87/ Zoehrer's aggressive on field behaviour over the summer was causing media controversy and Dyer was increasingly spoken of as a more viable option. After the 1987 tour to Sharjah, Zoehrer was omitted from the squad to tour India for the World Cup; he was replaced by Dyer. =1987 World Cup= Dyer was a key part of the Australian team which won the 1987 World Cup. Following this triumph, Dyer was appointed captain of NSW for the 1987-88 season. =1987-88 summer= Dyer began the 1987-88 summer as Australia's first choice keeper as they took on New Zealand. In the first test, Dyer took six catches and scored 8 runs with the bat, as Australia earned a then-rare victory.http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/16721/scorecard/63473/Australia-vs- New-Zealand-1st-Test-new-zealand-tour-of-australia-1987-88/ In the second test, a draw, Dyer scored 60.http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/16721/scorecard/63474/Australia-vs-New- Zealand-2nd-Test-new-zealand-tour-of-australia-1987-88/ Catching controversy In the third test, New Zealand were 1-119 when Dyer claimed a catch off Andrew Jones from the bowling of Craig McDermott.

In March 1988, Dyer was dropped from the Australian side to tour Pakistan that winter in favour of Ian Healy. This was considered a shock selection at the time because Healy was relatively inexperienced at first class level. He was reappointed captain of NSW for the 1988-89 summer. He was sacked mid season, replaced as wicketkeeper by Phil Emery and as captain by Geoff Lawson.

He was executed in 1901 for attempted train robbery. First train robberies and murders Tom Ketchum was born in San Saba County, Texas. He left Texas in 1890, possibly after committing a crime. He worked as a cowboy in the Pecos River Valley of New Mexico, where by 1894, his older brother, Sam Ketchum, had joined him.Texas State Historical Association (TSHA) Black Jack and a group of others were named as the robbers of an Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway train that was en route to Deming, New Mexico Territory, in 1892 with a large payroll aboard. The gang supposedly robbed the train just outside Nutt, New Mexico Territory, a water station twenty miles north of Deming. Black Jack and his gang would often visit the ranch of Herb Bassett, near Brown's Park, Colorado, who was known to have done business with several outlaws of the day, having supplied them with beef and fresh horses. Herb Bassett was the father of female outlaws Josie Bassett and Ann Bassett, who were girlfriends to several members of Butch Cassidy's Wild Bunch gang. One of Ann Bassett's boyfriends and future Wild Bunch gang member, Ben Kilpatrick, began riding with Black Jack's gang about that time. Outlaw \\"Bronco Bill\\" Walters, later noted for the legend of his \\"hidden loot\\" near Solomonville, Arizona, is also believed to have begun riding with the gang at this time. The second major crime attributed to Tom was the murder of a neighbor, John N. \\"Jap\\" Powers, in Tom Green County, Texas, on December 12, 1895. However, information at the Sutton Historical Society in Texas, says that Will Carver and Sam Ketchum were the ones actually accused of killing Powers in Knickerbocker. Fearing the law, they closed their joint saloon and gambling venture in San Angelo, and hit the outlaw trail. Within six months, Mrs. Powers and her lover, J. E. Wright, were arrested for the murder, but it was too late for Carver and the Ketchums. By late 1895, outlaw Harvey \\"Kid Curry\\" Logan and his brother Lonnie Curry were members of Black Jack's gang. However, in early 1896, a dispute concerning their share of robbery loot prompted the Currys to leave the gang. It is alleged that Ketchum was involved with the February 1, 1896, disappearance and presumed murders of Albert Jennings Fountain and his son Henry Fountain of Las Cruces, New Mexico. In early June 1896, after working for the famed Bell Ranch in New Mexico, Tom and Sam Ketchum, and possibly others, robbed a combined store and post office at Liberty, New Mexico, northwest of present-day Tucumcari. According to contemporary accounts, the Ketchums rode into Liberty on June 12 and purchased supplies. That evening, a thunderstorm began, and they returned to the store, owned by Morris and Levi Herzstein, who invited them to take shelter. Returning the next morning to open his store, Levi Herzstein found that both the store and post office had been burglarized. After gathering a posse, Herzstein set out on the outlaws' trail. The posse, composed of just four men, took the two outlaws by surprise in the Plaza Largo arroyo, where a shootout immediately began. Seconds later both Levi Herzstein and Hermenejildo Gallegos lay dead. Seeing his comrades fall, Anastacio Borgue turned his horse and rode out of the arroyo. Placido Gurul√©, the fourth member of the posse, also survived to give an account. Gurul√© said he had been struck by a .30-30 bullet that knocked him off his horse. He landed on the ground with a blow that knocked the wind out of him. He lay in a semiconscious state as Black Jack Ketchum emptied his rifle into the bodies of Levi Herzstein and Hermenejildo Gallegos. Tom and Sam Ketchum were never tried for the killings at the Plaza Largo arroyo, but Morris Herzstein reportedly was present in Clayton, New Mexico Territory to witness the hanging of Black Jack Ketchum in 1901. Morris Herzstein moved to Clayton shortly after the killing in Liberty, and finally into the Texas Panhandle area. This is memorialized by the inscription on a shoe brush: \\"Herzstein's Clayton, New Mexico -- Dalhart, Texas. If it's from Herzstein's it's correct.\\" Morris was the father of Albert Herzstein, who became one of the founders of Big 3 Industries in Houston, and is the man who helped the museum in Clayton to become a reality years later. Joining the Hole-In-The-Wall gang Following this event, Thomas Ketchum joined other outlaws of the Hole in the Wall Gang and continued a life of crime, focusing on train robberies, although when not robbing trains they worked for several ranches in New Mexico and Texas. Several other notable outlaws operated out of Hole In The Wall, which was a hideout for numerous outlaw gangs which operated separately. The famous Wild Bunch gang, led by Butch Cassidy and Elzy Lay, operated out of there. One Wild Bunch gang member, Kid Curry, along with his brother Lonny Curry, had previously ridden with Black Jack Ketchum and his gang. He and Ketchum did not like each other, and Ketchum avoided Curry as much as possible. Kid Curry would kill nine lawmen over the course of the next eight years. During this time, Tom Ketchum was once identified mistakenly as \\"Black Jack\\" Christian, another outlaw, and that became his nickname as well. Three of the train robberies that the gang committed were near the same location, between Folsom and Des Moines, New Mexico Territory. This was at the point where the old Fort Union wagon road crossed the Colorado and Southern Rail Road tracks near Twin Mountain. On September 3, 1897, they committed their first robbery at Twin Mountain. Then, on July 11, 1899, the gang, without Black Jack, robbed the train again at Twin Mountain. After the robbery, Sam and several unknown gang members, in addition to Wild Bunch gang members Will Carver and William Ellsworth \\"Elza\\" Lay, headed for the mountains southwest of Raton, New Mexico Territory. The next day, a posse consisting of Sheriff Ed Farr of Huerfano County, Colorado, Special Agent W.H. Reno of the Colorado & Southern Railroad, and five deputies found their trail and tracked them into Turkey Creek Canyon near Cimarron, New Mexico. There, the posse engaged them in a gun battle. Sam Ketchum and two deputies were wounded seriously, and the gang escaped. Sam Ketchum's wounds slowed the intended escape, and they made it only a short distance from the initial shootout. Several members of the posse cornered the Ketchum gang a few days later, still in the same area of the Territory. Deputy W. H. Love and Sheriff Ed Farr engaged the outlaws in another gun battle, resulting in both Love and Farr being killed, while the posse wounded at least two unknown members of the gang. Sam Ketchum escaped, but was found a few days later by Special Agent Reno at the home of a rancher, where he was arrested. Sam Ketchum was taken to the Santa Fe Territorial Prison, where he died from his gunshot wounds. He was buried in the Odd Fellows rest Cemetery, now the Fairview Cemetery on Cerrillos Rd. in Santa Fe. \\"Elzy\\" or \\"Elza\\" (William Ellsworth) Lay was born November 25, 1868, Mount Pleasant, Ohio. Lay had come out west to Denver, and became an outlaw after mistakenly believing he had killed a man. Jailed for life after the killing of Sheriff Farr after the Folsom robbery, he was released in 1906. He returned to Alma, New Mexico Territory and lived there for two years. He stayed with Louis and Walter Jones, who in 1904 had built a large merchandise store at Alma. Elzy died aged 65 in Los Angeles, on November 10, 1934. Capture and death Ketchum on the scaffold before hanging, April 26, 1901, Clayton, New MexicoSepia-tone photo from a contemporary postcard showing Tom Ketchum's decapitated body. Caption reads \\"Body of Black Jack after the hanging showing head snapped off.\\" On August 16, 1899, Tom Ketchum, supposedly knowing nothing of the July 11 hold- up which ended in the death of his brother Sam, single-handedly attempted to rob the same train again at the same place and in the same way that he and Sam and others had robbed it just a few weeks earlier. The train conductor, Frank Harrington, saw Tom approaching the moving train. He recognized him, grabbed a shotgun, and shot Tom in the arm, knocking him off his horse. The train continued, and the next day a posse came out and found Tom beside the tracks, badly wounded. He was transported to medical facilities at Trinidad, Colorado, and his right arm had to be amputated. He was nursed back to health and then sent to Clayton, New Mexico Territory, for trial. At the trial, Ketchum was convicted and sentenced to death. He was the only person ever hanged in Union County, New Mexico Territory (now Union County, New Mexico). He was also the only person who suffered capital punishment for the offense of \\"felonious assault upon a railway train\\" in New Mexico Territory (which did not become a state until 1912). Later, the law was found to be unconstitutional. Ketchum was executed by hanging in Clayton. Nobody in Clayton had any experience in conducting hangings; the rope was too long, and since Ketchum had gained a significant amount of weight during his time in jail, he was decapitated when he dropped through the trap door.San Francisco Chronicle, 27 April 1901 - Digital Copy. His last words were reported by the San Francisco Chronicle as: \\"Good-bye. Please dig my grave very deep. All right; hurry up.\\" A popular postcard was made showing the body. Afterwards his head was sewn back onto the body for viewing, and he was interred at the Clayton Cemetery. Media portrayals Western actor Jack Elam portrayed Ketchum in an episode of the 1954‚Äì55 syndicated television series Stories of the Century. Howard Duff played Ketchum in the 1957 American Western film, Blackjack Ketchum, Desperado. Rhodes Reason played Ketchum in a 1959 episode of the American Western television series Frontier Doctor.

The M*A*S*H book series includes the original novel that inspired the movie and then the TV series. The first, MASH: A Novel About Three Army Doctors, was co-authored by H. Richard Hornberger (himself a former military surgeon) and W. C. Heinz (a former World War II war correspondent); it was published in 1968 under the pen name Richard Hooker. It told the story of a U.S. Mobile Army Surgical Hospital in Korea during the Korean War. In 1972, Hornberger (writing again as Hooker) published the sequel M*A*S*H Goes to Maine, covering the lives of the surgeons after they returned home from the war. After the success of the M*A*S*H TV series, a long series of \\"M*A*S*H Goes to ______\\" novels appeared, beginning with M*A*S*H Goes to New Orleans in 1974. Although credited to Hooker and William E. Butterworth, they were essentially written by Butterworth alone. The sequel novels added many additional characters, mostly satiric caricatures of public figures from the 1970s: for instance, operatic tenor Luciano Pavarotti is parodied in the form of a singer named \\"Korsky-Rimsakov\\", and news anchor Dan Rather becomes the egotistical \\"Don Rhotten\\". The tone of the Butterworth novels is also markedly different from Hooker's original books, being much more broadly comical, less darkly satirical, and unrealistic. After the conclusion of the \\"Butterworth\\" series with M*A*S*H Goes to Montreal (1977), a final \\"Hooker\\" novel was published, M*A*S*H Mania, which ignored the events and inconsistencies of the intervening novels and picked up where M*A*S*H Goes to Maine left off, depicting the original characters in middle age.

Start in London, travel eastwards through India, Indonesia, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, and Ghana back home, all using the same ticket with the same airline alliance. A round- the-world ticket (also known as round-the-world fare or RTW ticket in short) is a product that enables travellers to fly around the world for a relatively low price. RTW tickets have existed for some time and in the past were generally offered through marketing agreements between airlines on several continents. Now, they are almost universally offered by airline alliances such as SkyTeam, Star Alliance and Oneworld, or else by specialist travel agencies that will spend time helping customize a trip to the consumer's needs. Prices vary but are generally in the range of 2,500‚Äì6,000 USD for an economy class ticket and 5,000‚Äì14,000 USD for business class. Sometimes, depending on airline and stops, it can be as low as 1171 GBP World Walkabout (~ 1829.57 USD). An alternative for a round-the-world ticket is a continent pass. Structure Round-the-world tickets are priced according to travel class, origin of travel, number of continents, mileage (usually between 30,000 and 60,000 km), and sometimes season of travel. The traveller benefits from the large and optimized network of the airline alliance and can often participate in the alliance's frequent flyer programs, although round-the-world tickets are usually subject to restrictions. The start and end of the journey almost always have to be located in the same country and exactly one crossing each of the Atlantic and Pacific must be included in the itinerary. The number of stops is usually restricted to 5‚Äì16, and backtracking between continents (especially Europe/Asia) is often restricted. The dates and journey do not have to be planned, but may be changed en route at a local office of any airline in the alliance (although a change of destinations often results in an additional fee, and if the next flight is left open-dated the booking can be dropped by the airlines). Specialist travel agencies It is possible to piece together a round-the-world route by combining one-way tickets on various airlines without resorting to alliances. In addition, discounts often apply to some long- and short-haul legs. It can be useful to consult with travel agents who specialize in round-the-world itineraries to compare fares and itineraries. These can be found in major cities that are transit hubs ‚Äî San Francisco, London, New York, Bangkok, etc. ‚Äî and many of them also provide services online. The overall booking process can vary from a few days to weeks based upon itinerary, budget, and other considerations. Travel agents may get parts of tickets issued by contacts in other countries, and often use pre- arranged contractual agreements with various airlines. Low-cost carriers often only have tickets which do not include other airlines. It is important to have long waiting time between such flights, preferably a hotel night, which gives the chance to see one more city. Otherwise a flight cancellation might destroy the entire itinerary.

Called one of the \\"pre-eminent career diplomats in American post-war history\\", he was best known for his work as Ronald Reagan's special envoy to the Middle East 1981‚Äì83. In that role he averted an Israel-Syria war and an Israel-PLO war in 1981, then negotiated a peaceful end to Israel's 1982 siege of Beirut. In 1986 he was instrumental in ending Ferdinand Marcos's attempt to steal the 1986 presidential election in the Philippines. As U.S. special envoy to Central America in 1986‚Äì87, he helped Costa Rican president Oscar Arias shape and sell the peace plan that led to the end of the region's civil wars. He had come out of retirement to take each of those assignments. During his 30-year career as a Foreign Service Officer, he had mostly specialized in Asia. In 1968, he was instrumental in halting the escalation of U.S. involvement in Vietnam.\\"One Brief Miracle: The Diplomat, the Zealot, and the Wild Blundering Siege,\\" chapters 1, 2; \\"Cursed Is the Peacemaker,\\" Appendix C. After his death, The New York Times described him as \\"the outstanding professional diplomat of his generation in the United States.\\" Early life Born in Brooklyn, New York, Habib was raised in a predominantly Jewish neighborhood of its Bensonhurst section by Lebanese Maronite Catholic parents. His father ran a grocery store. Habib graduated from New Utrecht High School in Brooklyn and worked as a shipping clerk before starting his undergraduate study in forestry out west at the University of Idaho in Moscow. As a college student on the Palouse, he was well-regarded by his peers and was an accomplished poker player. After graduating in 1942 from the UI's College of Forestry (now Natural Resources), he served in the U.S. Army during World War II and attained the rank of captain. Discharged from the service in 1946, Habib continued his education via the G.I. Bill in a doctoral program in agricultural economics at the University of California in Berkeley, and earned a Ph.D. in 1952. In 1947, recruiters for the United States Foreign Service visited the Berkeley campus. They were particularly interested in candidates who did not fit the then-current mold of Ivy League blueblood WASPs. Though he had never given diplomacy a moment's thought, he enjoyed taking tests for intellectual challenge. He took the Foreign Service exam and scored in the top 10% nationally.\\"Cursed Is the Peacemaker,\\" p. 16 Foreign service career Habib and grand nephew Gregory Cohen in his offices at the State Department in 1976 Beginning in 1949, his foreign service career took him to Canada, New Zealand, South Korea (twice), and South Vietnam. He held the State Department position of Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs from 1967‚Äì1969 and was chief of staff for the U.S. delegation to the Paris Peace Talks from 1968 to 1971. Habib acquired increasingly important posts, serving as Ambassador to South Korea (1971‚Äì1974), Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs (1974‚Äì1976), and Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs (1976‚Äì1978). When South Korean opposition leader Kim Dae-jung was kidnapped in 1973 while Habib was U.S. ambassador to South Korea, Habib's discreet but firm intervention saved Kim's life.\\"One Brief Miracle,\\" chapter 1 Kim later became the first opposition leader in South Korea to become president and also won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2000 for his reconciliation efforts with North Korea. A massive heart attack forced Habib to resign as Under Secretary, the top post for a career Foreign Service officer, in 1978. In 1981, President Ronald Reagan called him out of retirement to serve as special envoy to the Middle East.\\"One Brief Miracle,\\" chapters 1 and 2 Habib negotiated a peace that allowed the PLO to evacuate from the besieged city of Beirut. In 1982, for his efforts he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom‚Äîthe highest official honor given to a U.S. citizen by the U.S. government. He was also nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by Senator Charles H. Percy, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. Early in 1986, Reagan sent Habib to the Philippines to convince President Ferdinand Marcos to step down. In March 1986, Reagan appointed him as a special envoy to Central America with the intention of furthering U.S. interests in the conflict in Nicaragua. Administration hard-liners intended to use his fame and stature to advance a military solution, namely further funding of the Contras.Necessary illusions: thought control in democratic societies Deciding that the Contadora Plan had run its course, √ìscar Arias, the newly elected president of Costa Rica, drew up a plan that focused on democratization. While he viewed the Arias plan as riddled with loopholes, Habib worked to help revise it. \\"Phillip Habib became my ambassador to the rest of the Central American presidents,\\" said Arias. On August 7, 1987, the five Central American presidents, much to the shock of the rest of the world, agreed in principle to the Arias plan. Because further negotiating would require Habib to meet directly with Nicaragua's president, Daniel Ortega, President Reagan forbade him to travel. Believing he no longer had the confidence of the president, Habib resigned. Death and legacy While on vacation in France in 1992, Habib suffered a cardiac arrhythmia in Puligny- Montrachet and died on May 25 at age 72. Former Secretary of State George Shultz spoke at his funeral in Belmont, California, and characterized Habib as \\"...a man who really made a difference.\\" He was buried nearby at the Golden Gate National Cemetery in San Bruno, just south of San Francisco. Speakers at his memorial service in Washington at the National Cathedral the following week included two former Secretaries of State, Henry Kissinger and Cyrus Vance, and a future one, former colleague Lawrence Eagleburger. At the time of his death, Habib was one of the University of Idaho's most famous and respected graduates; he co-chaired the university's centennial fund-raising campaign several years earlier, as well as several class reunions. He moderated its Borah Symposium, an annual foreign affairs conference, in 1986, and received the university's highest honors for alumni in 1969, 1974, and 1983. John Boykin's 2014 e-book \\"One Brief Miracle: The Diplomat, the Zealot, and the Wild Blundering Siege\\" told the story of how Habib negotiated a peaceful end to Israel's 1982 siege of Beirut. It was an updated, abridged version of his 2002 hardback edition, \\"Cursed Is the Peacemaker: The American Diplomat Versus the Israeli General, Beirut 1982.\\"http://www.onebriefmiracle.com In 2006, Habib was featured on a United States postage stamp, one of a block of six featuring prominent diplomats. and In 2013, the city of Junieh, Lebanon, unveiled a bust of Habib among other \\"national heroes\\" in Friendship Square.\\"One Brief Miracle,\\" chapter 16 Warren Zevon wrote the song \\"The Envoy\\", from his 1982 album of the same name, in honor of Habib. Habib House, the Seoul residence of the United States Ambassador to Korea, is named for him.

Peterson. Founding SCARS is based on sciences of psychology, physiology, physical movement as well as research on the nervous system. SCARS was developed by Peterson after serving two tours in the US Army 173rd Airborne Brigade during the Vietnam War. It was debuted in 1987, and began to be taught to various military, law enforcement, and security units, such as the Arizona State police. Currently, SCARS is taught through private seminars, larger scale contracts, online training and DVDs. It contains no defensive actions, as all checks against the enemy's kicks or punches are delivered as strikes to vulnerable nerves. The program is based upon the idea that every human body reacts in the same way to specific injuries, and the program puts together various strikes to specific nerves, bones, and organs in order to debilitate an aggressive individual. The goal is to produce an \\"autokinematic reaction\\", creating a spinal reflex that happens in all humans. For example, if struck with kinetic force above the solar plexus, the upper body will react moving backwards. If struck below the solar plexus in the same way with kinetic force the body will buckle or the head will come forward. This reaction has nothing to do with pain, although it may hurt after the spinal reflex. It has everything to do with your spine reacting to protect your body. The three main elements of SCARS are geometry, physiology, and physics, and avoids the spiritual aspect that is prevalent in many martial arts. It focuses on immediate threat elimination and does not include an element of spiritual development. Government personnel training programs SCARS manual cover SCARS was initially presented to the Department of the Navy in 1988. SCARS Institute of Combat Sciences has developed training courses for the US Army and Air Force, as well as foreign governments and various law enforcement agencies. For the first seven years the fighting system remained exclusively known to and practiced by government personnel. The program was taught via seminars, government contracts, and also the SCARS Institute of Combative Sciences, once known as \\"the most expensive school in the world\\". The US Navy developed a training manual for teaching SCARS to members of the Navy and SEALs. It states in its introduction that it was used as \\"an educational system dealing primarily with the thought process in high risk areas of combat\\" and meant to \\"increase an individual's decision making skills in high stress areas of conflict\\". Public education In 1993 the company produced video programming to teach its techniques to the general public. Live seminars are also available to the public in which are taught reliable hand to hand, and hand to weapons combat techniques over the span of three days. The remainder of the Navy program was not released to the public in the videos or otherwise. The videos were first distributed in 1993 as the most expensive collection of defense videos ever produced; however, they sold a large number of copies, and grossed $1 million in the first nine months. In 1999 a SCARS TV program was scripted and cast, though it was not produced. Blake Peterson also published the book Attention! Teachers, Students and Parents! Survive the Unsurvivable! - What Science Tells Us About Fear, Self- Defense, School Shootings and Why Guns in Schools Might Not Be the Best Solution in 2013, using SCARS as the basis for teaching supervisory figures how to deal with the increasing gun violence in US schools. End of some S.C.A.R.S. courses in the Navy Cancellation of some SCARS courses was approved on April 17, 1998 by the Naval Special Warfare Commander, G.M. Moy, Assistant Chief of Staff for Operations.FOIA document 1500 Ser N32/0293 17 April 1998 Former Navy SEALs Jocko Willink and Leif Babin claim the system was ineffective, though they never actually went through the program.

Claude Michel (December 20, 1738 ‚Äì March 29, 1814), known as Clodion, was a French sculptor in the Rococo style, especially noted for his works in terracotta. Life He was born in Nancy to Anne Adam and Thomas Michel, an undistinguished sculptor. Anne was the sister of sculptors Lambert-Sigisbert Adam and Francois Gaspard Adam. In Nancy and probably in Lille he spent the earlier years of his life. In 1755 he came to Paris and entered the workshop of his maternal uncle Lambert-Sigisbert Adam, an established sculptor. He remained four years in this workshop, and on his death became a pupil of Jean-Baptiste Pigalle. In 1759 he obtained the grand prize for sculpture at the Acad√©mie Royale. In 1761 he obtained the first silver medal for studies from models. In 1762 he went to Rome, where his activity was considerable between 1767 and 1771. Catherine II of Russia was eager to secure his presence in St Petersburg, but he returned to Paris. Among his patrons, which were very numerous, were the chapter of Rouen, the states of Languedoc, and the Direction generale. His works were frequently exhibited at the Salon. In 1782 he married Catherine Flore, a daughter of the sculptor Augustin Pajou, who subsequently obtained a divorce from him. The agitation caused by the French Revolution drove Clodion in 1792 to Nancy, where he remained until 1798, his energies being spent in the decoration of houses. Among Clodion's works are a statue of Montesquieu, a Dying Cleopatra, and a chimneypiece at present in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. His 1788 work Dance of Time is in the Frick Collection in New York. Another known sculpture is called \\"The Intoxication of Wine.\\"* Clodion's \\"The Intoxication of Wine\\" At the Met (NY). Retrieved 29 April 2018. One of his last groups represented Homer as a beggar being driven away by fishermen (1810).

Origins The organisation's origins lay in National Unity, a political study group founded in 1959. It failed to unite nationalists as it had hoped, and so it worked with Gerry Quigley, Secretary of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, to call a conference of all nationalists.Brendan Lynn, Holding the Ground: The Nationalist Party in Northern Ireland, 1945 - 72 (1997), The conference was held on 19 April 1964 in Maghery. It was well attended, although Nationalist Party leader Eddie McAteer rejected his invitation, and other Nationalist MPs were reluctant to accept criticisms raised of them. The conference founded the National Political Front, with Anne McFadden as its secretary. The National Political Front aimed to develop policy for the Nationalist Party and any other sympathetic politicians, and to play a role in selecting future nationalist candidates. Despite this, the Nationalist Party chose to organise its own convention to choose a candidate for Fermanagh and South Tyrone at the 1964 general election. In the run-up to the election, McAteer wrote to leaders of other opposition parties to discuss forming a united opposition, and this produced talks with the Republican Labour Party. They released a joint programme entitled \\"39 Points\\", largely based on the demands of the National Political Front. However, the relationship between the Front and the Nationalists again soured before the end of 1964. As a result, some politicians resigned from the Nationalist Party, including John Hume. National Party In February 1965, the National Political Front founded a new organisation, the National Party, at a conference in Belfast. Prominent Nationalist Party members McAteer and Gerry Lennon attended as observers. This new group was chaired by Quigley, and aimed to organise supporters of a united Ireland in urban areas, to link with reinvigorated Nationalist Party groups in rural areas. Indeed, they pointedly did not organise in areas which already had a Nationalist MP.Thomas G. Mitchell, Native Vs. Settler In particular, they called on the Nationalist Party to adopt a constituency based structure with a party conference and agreed party programme.CAIN: Abstracts of Organisations - 'N' National Democratic Party By June 1965, the Nationalist Party had taken no action on the issues raised by the National Party. The new group decided to maintain the pressure, and renamed itself the \\"National Democratic Party\\". Nationalist Senator Paddy McGill was concerned that the NDP would try to take over the Nationalist Party. McAteer decided to aim for a close relationship with the new group, noting that they shared the \\"39 Points\\" programme. Closely associated with the new party was the National Democrats ginger group. This had the same aims as the NDP and was chaired by Ciaran McKeown.Ciaran McKeown, The Passion of Peace At the 1965 Northern Ireland general election, former Independent Labour Group politician John Joseph Brennan won the constituency of Belfast Central, without facing any opposition. Among the party's candidates were future MPs Eddie McGrady and Alasdair McDonnell.Gordon Gillespie, Historical Dictionary of the Northern Ireland Conflict Dissolution The next few years saw the start of The Troubles, and great radicalisation among Irish nationalists. Brennan lost his seat in 1969. Hume founded the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), bringing together independent nationalist politicians elected in 1969 and some representatives of existing parties. A large number of NDP members left to join the SDLP - making up 80% of its first 400 members. Facing a massive drop in membership, the NDP dissolved itself in October 1970, passing a resolution that all members should join the SDLP. These members included political strategist Ben Caraher, who was to greatly influence the approach of the early SDLP.Jorg Neuheiser and Stefan Wolff, Peace at Last? Note The National Democratic Party had no connection to the National Democrats that fielded a candidate in the East Londonderry constituency in the 1997 general election, which was a UK-wide breakaway from the British National Front.

On August 21, 1972, it was accepted into Soviet service and would later be widely exported. Large quantities were also produced under license in Romania as the TAB-77. The BTR-70 was developed as a potential successor for the earlier BTR-60 series of Soviet wheeled armored personnel carriers, specifically the BTR-60PB, which it most closely resembled. It evolved out of an earlier, unsuccessful project known as the GAZ-50 to design a new wheeled infantry fighting vehicle on the chassis and drive train of a BTR-60PB. It initially received the NATO reporting name BTR M1970. Development History The original GAZ-50 prototype. In 1971, the Soviet Armed Forces began investigating the possibility of an updated BTR-60PB redesigned to make the vehicle more compatible with the BMP-1 in terms of tactical training. This resulted in the development of a BTR-60PB prototype essentially converted into a wheeled infantry fighting vehicle, designated Obiekt 50 or GAZ-50. Despite retaining the original BTR-60PB chassis, the GAZ-50 incorporated several elements of the BMP's design, including similar seating arrangements in the passenger compartment. The revised internal layout reduced the number of passengers to nine. New hatches were also provided for debarking in the lower hull, between the second and third wheel stations. Other modifications included a slightly thicker hull, increased power-to-weight ratio, and additional firing ports. Another feature retained from the BTR-60 was the twin-engine arrangement, although in the GAZ-50 torque produced by the right engine powered the first and third wheel stations, while the left engine powered the second and fourth. This alteration was to allow the vehicle to continue moving even if one engine failed. The prototype was armed with a turret resembling that of the BMP-1, incorporating the same 73mm 2A28 Grom low-pressure smoothbore cannon. There was some debate as to the GAZ-50's viability in its intended role; for example, projected manufacturing costs were high due to the incorporation of the BMP-1 turret and armament. Furthermore, while the prototype would allow motorized units to emulate the tactics of Soviet mechanized infantry, it simply did not offer the same protection, mobility, and firepower of the BMP. Most of the funding earmarked for the program was thus diverted into producing larger numbers of BMPs instead, as well as ensuring their wider introduction beyond Soviet tank divisions. A second GAZ-50 prototype was built, designated Obiekt 60 mounting a 14.5mm machine gun in exactly the same turret as that carried by the BTR-60 series; this was accepted as a generic replacement for the BTR-60PB in motorized rifle regiments. In Soviet service, the new BTRs received the designation BTR-70. Compared to the earlier BTR-60PB, relatively small numbers of BTR-70s were produced. The design was still regarded as suffering from some of the same disadvantages, such as the two flammable petrol engines and the poor means of entry and exit. These flaws became especially evident when the vehicle was tested in combat during the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War. As a result, in 1984 the Soviet Army took delivery of a new wheeled armored personnel carrier, the BTR-80, which was powered by a single 260 horsepower diesel engine and a simpler drive train. Production of the BTR-70 was terminated that year. The Soviet Union only exported BTR-70s to four other states: Afghanistan, the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), Hungary, and Romania, which also purchased a license to manufacture the design locally. However, many have since been inherited by the armies of various post-Soviet republics or re- exported. Equipment The BTR-70 is powered by two petrol engines. Early production vehicles used 115 hp GAZ-69B 6-cylinder engines, but most vehicles have now been retrofitted with the more powerful ZMZ-49-05 V-8 engines. The vehicle is fully amphibious, propelled when afloat by a single water jet mounted at the rear of the hull. To prepare the vehicle for water, the driver erects a trim vane and switches on the bilge pumps from within the vehicle. The standard equipment includes a central tire-pressure regulation system that allows the driver to adjust the tire-pressure to suit the terrain being crossed. Also fitted is an R-123M radio set and an R-124 intercom. The driver's optical equipment consists of three TNPO-115 vision blocks and a TNP-B day vision device, which can be replaced by a TVNO-2B night vision device. The commander also has three TNPO-115s and either a TPKU-2B day sight or a TKN-1S night sight accompanied by an OU-3GA-2 infra-red search light. The turret is fitted with a PP-61AM (or 1PZ-2) periscopic sight for the gunner and the infantry group in the troop compartment is provided with TNP-B devices. The BTR-70 also has an FVU NBC filter system and a DK-3B detection device. The armaments consist of a KPVT heavy machine gun with 500 rounds and a coaxial 7.62 mm PKT machine gun with 2,000 rounds. Also on board are two \\"Igla\\" or \\"Strela-3\\" MANPADS, and optionally two AGS-17 grenade launchers at the expense of two infantry men.

Mokujin first appeared in the 1997 video game Tekken 3. Mokujin does not have his own fighting style. Instead, he mimics fighting styles from other characters, which varies from match to match. Appearances=In Tekken video game series= Mokujin is a training dummy made from a 2,000-year-old tree. He comes alive in the presence of great evil and it was said that he would become the world's last resort when humanity is unable to deal with them. While he appears to be mute (his \\"voice\\" is the sounds of wood-clicks), he is able to communicate with the humans using telepathy. Due to his experience as a dummy, he is able to imitate any fighting style. In Tekken 3, Mokujin is awakened when Ogre, the God of Fighting, was released. After Jin Kazama defeated Ogre in The King of Iron Fist Tournament 3, Mokujin grew lifeless once more, but he had a smile on his face.Tree's Tekken 5 prologue In Tekken 5, with the awakening of another powerful evil entity (Jinpachi Mishima), Mokujin has come to life once more. After the defeat of Jinpachi Mishima, Mokujin again became lifeless. In Tekken 6, Mokujin again comes to life when a being of great evil and the source of Devil Gene, Azazel awakened. Other than the main series, Mokujin appears in the non-canonical game Tekken Tag Tournament and its sequel Tekken Tag Tournament 2. He also appears as one of the unplayable penultimate bosses in free-to-play game Tekken Revolution. =Tetsujin= first appearing in Tekken Tag Tournament. Whereas Mokujin is constructed of wood, Tetsujin is constructed of iron. Both characters use the fighting styles of the other characters, and they both switch fighting styles between each round. While Mokujin's \\"fighting style\\" is referred as \\"Mokujin-ken\\", Tetsujin's is called \\"Tetsujin-ken\\", and similarly is the only sentence written in the movelist screen. He rarely appears in subsequent games, although Mokujin can be customized to look like Tetsujin in later installments. Tetsujin also appears as one of the unplayable penultimate bosses in free-to-play game Tekken Revolution and Tekken (Mobile). =Kinjin= is a secret unplayable boss character in free-to-play game Tekken Revolution. His design is likely based on an easter egg in the console version of Tekken Tag Tournament, where meeting certain requirements would cause Tetsujin's normally silver color to turn gold. In Tekken Revolution, he is basically Tetsujin made of gold wearing a crown, glasses, mustache, bow tie, and a cape. He is one of the Stage 7 penultimate bosses in Arcade mode, along with Mokujin, Tetsujin, Heihachi Mishima, and Jinpachi Mishima. =Other appearances= Mokujin appears in Namco x Capcom as a training dummy. In Street Fighter X Tekken, Pac-Man fights using a small mech designed to resemble a Mokujin. Outside of the video games, Mokujin appears in the 2011 CGI film Tekken: Blood Vengeance as the mascot of Kyoto International School Festival, which the main characters attend. Later, it is revealed that the Kyoto Temple hides a tomb of the ancient spirits of Mokujin, which takes form of the forest surrounding the temple. Heihachi exploits this to fight Devil Jin, though he fails and the spirit presumably vanishes. Mokujin also is referenced in the Ridge Racer series, as branding in signs and in the Kamata Fiera in Ridge Racer 7. Mokujin also appears in Idea Factory's Trillion: God of Destruction, as a training dummy capable of taking the form of the titular monster for training purposes. Mokujin makes a cameo appearance in Pokken Tournament in the background of one of the of game's fighting stages. A Mokujin-esque character also appears in Kyary Pamu Pamu's video \\"Harajuku Iyahoi\\". Reception Gaming Target ranked Mokujin seventh on the list of top 11 Tekken fighters. GamesRadar listed the character on its \\"28 of the most favourite video game trees ever\\", a compilation of answers for the question \\"what is your favourite video game tree and why?\\". 1UP.com mentioned him as one of the characters they wanted to see in Street Fighter X Tekken, adding Mokujin provides \\"a challenge to expert players who want to prove they've mastered everyone in the game.\\" Complex ranked the fact Mokujin having breasts in Tekken 6 as the thirteenth Tekkens craziest moment, saying \\"we haven't been this disturbed since we saw Howard the Duck with its naughty duck tits scene.\\" In 2012, she was listed as one of the most \\"ridiculous\\" Tekken Tag Tournament 2 characters by Game Informer, who stated, a \\"training dummy\\" can not have its own fighting style, and if it has it should be called \\"Stand motionless and get the crap kicked out of you because you're a stupid training dummy.\\" Computer and Video Games agreed with his Game Informer fellow, putting Mokujin in their list of \\"Tekkens worst ever characters\\", adding \\"when humanity's best hope against a fire-breathing monster is made of wood and twigs, it's probably time to think about just buying a gun.\\" GameDaily ranked Mokujin nineteenth on their \\"Top 25 Most Bizarre Fighting Characters\\".

Life Mews was born at Caundle Purse in Dorset, and was educated at the Merchant Taylors' School, London, and at St John's College, Oxford, of which he was scholar and fellow.Alumni Oxonienses 1500-1714, Mascall-Meyrick When the Civil War broke out in 1642, Mews joined the Royalist army, and, having been made a captain, was taken prisoner at Naseby; but he was soon released and in 1648 sought refuge in Holland. He became friendly with King Charles I's secretary, Sir Edward Nicholas, and being skilful at disguising himself was very useful to the Royalists during the rule of Oliver Cromwell, undertaking two journeys to Scotland in 1653. In August of that year, his friend Nicholas applied to Mary, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange, to use her influence to get Mews a post as reader in philosophy at the Orange College of Breda, but had a reply from Hyde that the place called for a man \\"that hath not bene a truant from his bookes\\".William Holden Hutton, \\"Mews, Peter\\", in Dictionary of National Biography (1885-1900), volume 37 Before this Mews had been ordained. Taking the degree of DCL and regaining his fellowship at Oxford after the Restoration, he became Archdeacon of Huntingdon, vicar of St Mary's, Reading, and chaplain to the King; then, having obtained two other livings, he was made canon of Windsor, canon of St David's, and Archdeacon of Berkshire (1665‚Äì1672). In 1667, when at Breda arranging peace between England and the Dutch Republic, he was chosen President of St John's College, Oxford, in succession to his father-in-law, Richard Baylie, afterwards becoming Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford and dean of Rochester. Appointed Bishop of Bath and Wells in 1672, Mews resigned his presidency in 1673, and in 1684 he was elected Bishop of Winchester, a position which this \\"old, honest cavalier,\\" as Thomas Hearne calls him, filled until his death. The bishop is buried in Winchester Cathedral. Mews lent his carriage horses to pull the cannon at a critical moment during the battle of Sedgemoor, where he was wounded whilst accompanying the royal army. He was, however, in sympathy with the Seven Bishops, and was only prevented by illness from attending their meeting; and as visitor of Magdalen College, Oxford, he supported the fellows in their resistance to James II, admitted their nominee, John Hough, to the presidency, and restored the ejected fellows in October 1688. He took the oaths to William III and Mary II in 1689. In the absence of Henry Compton, Bishop of London, Mews took the chief part at the consecration of John Tillotson as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1691. A superb portrait is displayed in the Great Hall of the 15th century manor house, Athelhampton Hall, known as Athelhampton House, just a few miles outside Dorchester in Dorset.

The war was a Swedish victory and led to Norway being forced into the United Kingdoms of Sweden and Norway, a union with Sweden under the Swedish king Charles XIII but with Norway having its own constitution and parliament. Background=Treaty of Kiel= As early as in 1812, prior to the Napoleonic invasion of Russia, the Swedish Crown Prince Charles John had entered into an agreement with Tsar Alexander I that Russia would support a Swedish attack on Norway in order to force Denmark-Norway to cede its northern part to Sweden.Angell, Henrik (1914). Syv- aars-krigen for 17. mai 1807-1814. Kristiania: Aschehoug. p. 219 The Swedish attack against Norway was postponed, however, due to the fluid state of the conflict between Napoleon and the Sixth Coalition. The Swedish army and, incidentally, Bernadotte's skills as a general, were urgently needed against France in Central Europe. On 18 May 1813 Swedish troops re-occupied Swedish Pomerania and deployed against Napoleon's forces as a result of treaties between Charles John, on the behalf of Sweden, and the United Kingdom and Prussia, which ceded Norway to Sweden for is participation in the war becoming effective after France and its allies (which included Denmark-Norway) were defeated.Angell, p. 220Barton, Sir Dunbar Plunket. (1925) Bernadotte Prince and King. P. 68. John Murray, London. In early December Charles John led an invasion of Denmark with his Allied Army of the North that included Swedes, Russians and North Germans. The Danes were outnumbered and were unable to mount a coherent defense against Bernadotte's battle-hardened army. Within a few days the Danes were forced out of Holstein and into the Jutland proper. By December 14 Bernadotte agreed to an armistice and peace talks began in Kiel on the basis of the cession of Norway to Sweden in return for Swedish Pomerania, additional territory in North Germany, specifics to be decided at the general peace conference following the cessation of hostilities between the Sixth Coalition and Imperial France, as well as 1,000,000 Riksdalers. The Danish position was hopeless and by early January 1814 the Danish King reconciled himself to the necessity of losing NorwayScott, Franklin D. (1935) Bernadotte and the Fall of Napoleon. Pp. 119-148. Harvard University Press, Boston.Barton, Sir Dunbar Plunket. (1925) Bernadotte Prince and King. Pp. 111-116. John Murray, London. By the Treaty of Kiel, signed on 13 January, King Frederik VI of Denmark-Norway had to cede Norway to the King of Sweden. However, this treaty was not accepted by the Norwegians who refused to be bartered about like so many chattels. Elements of the Danish Government also covertly supported Norway's determination to not be incorporated into Sweden.Ibid. 135 Ultimately, Denmark would pay a catastrophic price for its intrigues, as Bernadotte viewed this support, no matter how covert, as perfidy and a violation of the Treaty of Kiel, and this would later be reflected in the final peace crafted at the Congress of Vienna wherein the provisions to award Swedish Pomerania, along with various additional Northern German territory, as well as 1,000,000 Riksdalers to Denmark as compensation for its loss of Norway, were voided.Ibid. 138. =Norwegian Constituent Assembly= Prince Christian Frederick of Denmark, heir presumptive to the thrones of Denmark and Norway and Governor-general of Norway, took the lead in the insurrection, and he called for a constitutional assembly. This adopted the liberal constitution of 17 May, which also elected Christian Frederick as the king of an independent Norway. As the head of the new state, Christian Frederick desperately tried to gain support from the United Kingdom, or any of the other major powers within the Sixth Coalition, in order to maintain Norway's independence. However, the foreign diplomats gave no hope for any outside support to the Norwegians. Armies The Norwegian Army mustered 30,000 men, and it had taken up positions away from the border with Sweden, in the fear of being outflanked. The Norwegian navy had few vessels, and most of them were stationed at the islands of Hvaler, close to Sweden. The Swedish Army consisted of 45,000 men, experienced and well-equipped soldiers. The Swedish Navy had a number of large vessels and a capacity for moving and landing troops as well as assistance from the British Royal Navy.Scott, Franklin D. (1935) Bernadotte and the Fall of Napoleon. Pp. 119-130. John Murray, London =Major commanders= * Jean Baptiste Bernadotte ‚Äì former Marshal of France and known as Carl Johan, Crown Prince of Sweden at that time * Magnus Bj√∂rnstjerna ‚Äì Swedish general * Johannes Klingenberg Sejersted ‚Äì Norwegian major general * Frederik Gottschalck von Haxthausen ‚Äì Norwegian minister of finance and Oberhofmarschall War The hostilities opened on 26 July with a swift Swedish naval attack against the Norwegian gunboats at Hvaler. The Norwegian army was evacuated and the vessels managed to escape, but they did not take part in the rest of the war. The main Swedish offensive came across the border at Halden, bypassing and surrounding the fortress of Fredriksten, and then continuing north, while a second force of 6,000 soldiers landed at Kr√•ker√∏y outside of Fredrikstad. This town surrendered the next day. This was the start of a pincer movement around the main part of the Norwegian army at Rakkestad. On the front towards Kongsvinger the forces were more evenly matched, and the Norwegian army eventually stopped the Swedish advance at Lier on 2 August, and won another victory at Matrand on 5 August. On 3 August, King Christian Frederick reached the front at √òstfold and was persuaded to change his strategy and use the 6,000 men stationed at Rakkestad in a counterattack against the Swedes. The order to counterattack was given on the 5th of August, but the order was recalled a few hours later. The Norwegian forces therefore withdrew over the Glomma river at Langnes in Askim.Dyrvik, St√•le; Feldb√¶k, Ole (1996). Aschehoughs Norgeshistorie - Mellom br√∏dre - 1780-1830. 7. Oslo: H. Aschehough & Co. p. 159 The last major battle of the war was fought on 9 August at the bridgehead at Langnes, where the Swedish forces once more were driven back.Syv-aars-krigen for 17de mai 1807-1814 (1914) by Henrik Angell (1995), Sweden then attempted to outflank the Norwegian line, and successfully did so during the battle of Kj√∏lberg Bridge on the 14th of August. The Swedes then had a clear path to Kristiania, the Norwegian capital. In addition, the British blockade of Norway gradually worsened the Norwegians' situation, making food shortages common everywhere. The proximity of Swedish armies and the British blockade eventually made the Norwegians' situation unsustainable. Although the Norwegian Army had won at Langnes, it was nevertheless clear to both the Norwegian and Swedish military authorities that a defeat was inevitable. Even as they had managed to deliver several minor offensive blows to the Swedes, thus applying pressure on the Swedes to accept Norway as a sovereign nation, it was considered impossible to try to stop the Swedes in the long run. The Swedish offer of negotiations was therefore accepted as the war had put a heavy strain on the Norwegian finances. Every day of delay in securing Norway by the Swedes brought uncertainty to them regarding the outcome, so both parties were interested in a quick end to the war. For the ordinary Norwegian soldier the war had seemed ill-prepared and ill-fought. The allegations of the loss were against Christian Frederick and the Norwegian general Haxthausen; the latter was accused of treason. For the Norwegian government it probably had been more of a matter of getting the best possible bargaining position, as without the support of major powers Norway's independence was impossible to secure. But by agreeing to talks following the victory at Langnes they were in a situation where they could avoid an unconditional surrender. Aftermath On 10 August, Bernadotte presented a proposal for a cease-fire. The proposal included a major concession--Bernadotte, on behalf of the Swedish government, accepted the Eidsvoll constitution. In doing so, he tacitly gave up any claims that Norway would be merely a Swedish province. Negotiations started in Moss, Norway on 10 August, and after a few days of hard negotiations, a cease fire agreement, called the Convention of Moss, was signed on 14 August. King Christian Frederick was forced to abdicate, but Norway remained nominally independent within a personal union with Sweden, under the Swedish king. Its Constitution was upheld with only such amendments as were required to allow it to enter into the union, and the two united kingdoms retained separate institutions, except for the king and the foreign service and policy.

He was raised in Galveston, Texas, where his father was the president of several banks. Moving to Chicago, he became a partner in the advertising firm of Lord & Thomas. He created and produced many successful ad campaigns. He made new use of radio, changing popular culture and appealing to consumers' psychology. A Republican, he designed new ways to advertise election campaigns, especially the Warren Harding campaign of 1920, and became a philanthropist. Early life and career Lasker was born on May 1, 1880 in Freiburg, Germany, the son of Nettie Heidenheimer Davis and Morris Lasker. His family was Jewish. Morris had emigrated from Prussia in 1840, while Lasker's mother was an American citizen. They lived in Galveston, Texas, but Morris had moved Nettie to Germany during her pregnancy for better medical care. The family returned to Galveston within six months, and Lasker spent the rest of his childhood in Texas.Morello, John A.. \\"Albert Lasker.\\" In Immigrant Entrepreneurship: German-American Business Biographies, 1720 to the Present, vol. 4, edited by Jeffrey Fear. German Historical Institute. Last modified June 26, 2013. Lasker started working as a newspaper reporter while he was still a teenager. He assisted the successful Congressional campaign of the Republican Robert Hawley in 1896. Although Texas politics had been dominated by the Democratic Party since shortly after Reconstruction, in this election, many voters split between the Democrats and the Populist Party, and Hawley won with less than 50% of the votes. In 1898 his father, who disapproved of journalism, persuaded Lasker to move to Chicago to try an advertising position at Lord & Thomas. After he worked as an office boy for a year, one of the agency's salesmen left, and Lasker acquired his territory. During this time, Lasker created his first campaign. He hired a friend, Eugene Katz, to write the copy for a series of Wilson Ear Drum Company ads. They featured a photograph of a man cupping his ear. George Wilson, president of the Ear Drum company, adopted the ads and his sales increased. CEO Lord & Thomas When Lord retired in 1903, Lasker purchased his share and became a partner.American National Business Hall of Fame He purchased the firm in 1912 at the age of 32. Chicago, along with New York, was the center of the nation's advertising industry. Lasker, known as the \\"father of modern advertising,\\" Wolfgang Saxon, \\"Emerson Foote, 85, Who Headed Large Advertising Agencies, Dies\\", The New York Times made Chicago his base 1898‚Äì1942. As head of the Lord and Thomas agency, Lasker devised a copywriting technique that appealed directly to the psychology of the consumer. Women seldom smoked cigarettes; he told them if they smoked Lucky Strikes they could stay slender. Lasker's use of radio, particularly with his campaigns for Palmolive soap, Pepsodent toothpaste, Kotex products, and Lucky Strike cigarettes, not only revolutionized the advertising industry but also significantly changed popular culture.Arthur W. Schultz, \\"Albert Lasker's Advertising Revolution,\\" Chicago History, Nov 2002, Vol. 31#2 pp. 36‚Äì53 =Salesmanship in print= Lasker had an inquiring mind about what advertising was and how it worked. In 1904 he met John E. Kennedy, a former Canadian mounted policeman who had entered advertising. Lasker believed that advertising was news, but Kennedy said, \\"[N]ews is a technique of presentation, but advertising is a very simple thing. I can give it to you in three words, it is 'salesmanship in print'\\".Jeffrey L. Cruikshank & Arthur W. Schultz, The Man Who Sold America, pp. 54‚Äì56 The pair used this concept with the 1900 Washer Co. (later Whirlpool). Their campaign was so successful that, within four months of running the first ad, they attracted additional clients and their \\"advertising spend\\" went from $15,000 a year to $30,000 a month. Within six months, their firm was one of the three or four largest advertising agencies in the nation. In 1908 Lasker recruited Claude C. Hopkins to the firm, specifically to work on the Van Camp Packaging Company (Van Camp's) account. The relationship lasted for 17 years. Lasker helped create America's infatuation with orange juice. Lord & Thomas acquired the Sunkist Growers, Incorporated account in 1908, when Lasker was 28. The citrus industry was in a slump, and California growers were producing so many oranges that they were cutting down trees in order to limit supply. Lasker created campaigns that not only encouraged consumers to eat oranges but also to drink orange juice. He was able to increase consumption enough so that the growers stopped chopping down their groves.John Gunther, Taken at the Flood, p. 72 Among Lasker's pioneering contributions was the introduction into public schools of classes that explained to young girls about puberty and menstruation (done to promote Kotex tampons). He is also credited as the creator of the soap opera genre, and using radio and television as media driven by advertising. Business interests Lasker was an early owner of the Chicago Cubs baseball team. He acquired an interest in the team in 1916 and soon purchased majority control. He originated the Lasker Plan, a report that recommended baseball's governing authority be reformed. This led to the creation of the office of the Commissioner of Baseball. Lasker, along with his business partner Charles Weeghman, are credited with moving the Cubs into the club's current home, Wrigley Field. In 1925, he sold the team to one of his minor partners, William Wrigley Jr. Lasker became the second-largest shareholder in the Pepsodent company,\\"CORPORATIONS: Old Empire, New Prince\\", TIME which had become an L&T; client in 1916. It was sold to Lever Brothers in 1944.Albert Lasker Ad Samples , American National Business Hall of Fame After developing a private estate, Mill Road Farm, in Lake Forest, Illinois, Lasker had a golf course built on it. The National Golf Review in 1939 rated the Lasker Golf Course as No. 23 on its list of \\"Top 100 Courses in the World.\\" Following the Great Depression, Lasker donated the entire property to the University of Chicago.Phil Kosin, \\"Ghost Courses\\", Chicagoland Golf Politics Lasker continued to be active in the Republican Party and showed the party how to use modern advertising techniques to sell their candidates. He was a key advisor in the 1920 Harding campaign, which resulted in one of the largest landslides in history, as Warren G. Harding appealed for votes in newsreels, billboards and newspaper adsJohn A. Morello, Selling the President, 1920: Albert D. Lasker, Advertising, and the Election of Warren G. Harding (2001) and aimed advertising at women who had recently achieved the right to vote. On June 9, 1921, President Harding's appointment of Lasker as chairman of the United States Shipping Board was confirmed by the US Senate. Lasker took the job on the condition that he would serve no more than two years. At the time, he was only the third man of Jewish descent to have been appointed to such a high post in the federal government.Cruikshank & Shultz (2010), The Man Who Sold America, pp. 199‚Äì204 Lasker inherited a large mess, with over 2,300 ships under Shipping Board control losing money every day. A full quarter of the fleet were wooden hulled, and by this time were obsolete. He disposed of useless ships at an average price of $30 a ton, incurring criticism from Congress for \\"throwing our ships away\\". His accomplishments included the refitting of the SS Leviathan for passenger service, as well as originating ship-to-shore telephone services.John Gunther(1960), Taken at the Flood, p. 132 Lasker, who had no previous experience in the shipping business before his appointment, true to his word, ended his service in office on July 1, 1923.Werner (1935), Privileged Characters, pp. 328‚Äì329 Later years The mausoleum of Albert Lasker After 30 years as its chief executive, Lasker sold the firm to three senior executives. It became Foote, Cone & Belding in 1942. Lasker married three times. In 1902, he married Flora Warner. The couple had three children before her death in 1934: Mary Lasker Block (born 1904). Edward Lasker (born 1912), and Frances Lasker Brody (born 1916). In 1938, he married actress Doris Kenyon but the marriage ended in divorce a year later. Lasker ‚Äî and especially his third wife Mary Lasker (married 1940) ‚Äî were nationally prominent philanthropists. They played major roles in promoting and expanding the National Institutes of Health, helping its budget expand from $2.4 million in 1945 to $5.5 billion in 1985.Joel L. Fleishman, et al. Casebook for the Foundation: A Great American Secret (2007) p. 50 They founded and endowed the Lasker Award, which has recognized the work of many leading scientists and researchers. On May 30, 1952, Lasker died in New York at the age of 72. He was interred in a private mausoleum at Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Sleepy Hollow. Bipolar disorder The book \\"The Man Who Sold America\\" posits that Lasker had Bipolar II disorder, which affected his personal and work life. Lasker operated at a high energy level. He was frequently expansive, irritable, highly verbal, intensely creative, and insomniac‚Äîall symptoms of a condition that today would be called hypomania. He never ascended to the level of mania that is generally associated with manic depression, or‚Äîagain in today's vocabulary‚Äîa bipolar I disorder, although he sometimes behaved erratically, especially under the influence of alcohol. Most likely, he was afflicted by a bipolar II disorder. Recent research suggests that there is an increased risk of bipolar II disorder among people whose family members suffer from the disorder. Eduard Lasker, Albert's uncle, seems to have had depressive episodes. Morris, too, may have experienced depressions: his rollercoaster financial affairs may have had their root, in part, in some sort of affective illness. Finally, the diagnosis is supported by Lasker's age when the apparent ailment overtook him. Bipolar I‚Äîthe affective state that is accompanied by wild, manic excess‚Äîusually first manifests itself in the teenage years, while the more subtle, hypomanic form of the illness often stays masked until the mid- or late twenties. Lasker was stricken at age twenty-seven.Jeffrey L. Cruikshank & Arthur W.

The geographical elevation is between and the of Monte Cetona itself, at the base of which the town is situated at around . History Some of the oldest human settlements of central Italy were discovered at the base of Monte Cetona, such as the early neo-Paleolithic Gosto cave (40‚Äì80th century BC) and Lattaia cave (9‚Äì10th century BC). The Belverde park hosts 25 prehistoric and Bronze Age caves, such as the San Francesco cave. There are several sites of Etruscan finds. The town of Cetona developed on the hillside around the rocca fortress, containing a square tower (about 900 AD) and an inner fortress wall. It became known as the Scitonia castle. In the first mention of the comune, at the end of the 11th century, Pope Gregory VII granted feudal rights to a member of his family, the Aldobrandeschi. The family's heirs sold the rights,Cetona: storia (archived link, 16 February 2012) and in the 14th century, Cetona was alternatingly ruled by Siena and Orvieto (until 1354), and, after a brief rule by Perugia, was annexed by Siena. An outer wall was built, containing two round towers (1458). Grand Duke Cosimo I de' Medici of Tuscany sold Cetona in 1556, to the marchese Chiappino Vitelli (1519‚Äì75), who made the fortress into a private residence, and built the piazza below it, today named Piazza Garibaldi. His descendants also erected Palazzo Vitelli in the late 17th century. Cetona was connected to Sarteano (1772‚Äì1840), and annexed to Italy in 1861. The place name of Cetona or Citonia (local variation) probably comes from the Latin word caedita, \\"felled, deforested\\" with regard to a deforested and cultivated place. An early Christian baptistery, now a parish church, mentioned in documents as baptisterium Sancti Johannis de Queneto or de Queteno, may have been named in reference to the Chieteno stream that flows just south of Cetona. Main sights Archeological finds are on display in Museo Civico per la Preistoria del Monte Cetona (in Town), which also administers the Parco Archeologico Naturalistico del Monte Cetona (three km towards Monte Cetona). The Rocca is still privately owned; the other significant hill is occupied by Palazzo a Parco Terrosi (1750), owned by Valentino. Churches in Cetona are the Chiesa di San Michele Arcangelo (built 1155) and the Chiesa la Collegiata della San Trinita church (1475), as well as the Convento di San Francesco (since 1212) and Convento di Santa Maria a Belverde (frescoes by Cola Petruccioli of Orvieto).

He was a South African who served in the First World War as a South African Army medical orderly and in the Second World War as a Royal Air Force chaplain. Pugh died in 1941 by remaining aboard a sinking troop ship to minister to trapped and wounded military personnel. Life Christ Church, Friern Barnet, where Pugh was pastor 1927‚Äì39 before becoming a troop ship Pugh was the second of seven children of Harry Walter and Jane (Douglas) Pugh. He was born in 1898 in Johannesburg and attended Jeppe High School for Boys. In the First World War in 1917‚Äì19 he was a medical orderly in France with the South African Field Ambulance. After the war Pugh went to England, studied at Mansfield College, Oxford 1920‚Äì24 and became a Congregational clergyman. He was in civilian ministry at Camberley Congregational Church 1924‚Äì27 and then at Christ Church, Friern Barnet, Middlesex 1927‚Äì39. Pugh married Amy Lilian Tarrant and they had three children: sons Geoffrey and Alastair and daughter Fiona. RAF service When the Second World War broke out in 1939 Pugh became an RAF Chaplain, with the rank of Squadron Leader. He served at RAF Bridgnorth in Shropshire until 1941, when he was then posted to Takoradi on the Gold Coast. His passage to Takoradi was to be via a voyage on the troop ship to Freetown, Sierra Leone. Anselm was a cargo and passenger liner that had been converted into a troop ship by designating her passenger accommodation as officers' quarters and turning her holds into accommodation for other ranks. She had capacity for about 500 troops but on this occasion was heavily overloaded with about 1,200 British Army, Royal Marines and RAF personnel. There were 175 RAF personnel, on their way to serve in the North African Campaign. On 5 July the torpedoed Anselm about 300 miles north of the Azores. The explosion caused extensive damage below decks, where collapsed overheads and wrecked ladders injured or trapped many of the men in one of the converted holds. One survivor states that officers got away in boats from Anselms stern without waiting to help their men. Pugh, however, remained aboard, tending the wounded and helping to launch lifeboats and liferafts. As Anselms bow settled lower in the water, Pugh turned his attention to his fellow-airmen injured and trapped in one of the converted holds. He told some Royal Marines to lower him on a rope into the hold, insisting \\"Where my men are, I have to be\\". The Marines tried to dissuade him, but Pugh insisted \\"My love of God is greater than my fear of death\\" so they did as he insisted. Once in the hold he knelt to pray with the trapped men, with seawater already up to his shoulders. Anselm sank 22 minutes after she was hit. Pugh was not seen again. George Cross Pugh's actions profoundly affected some of the 1,060 survivors. One at first thought his self-sacrifice had been \\"silly\\", but then recognised his bravery as an example. Other airmen and soldiers praised Pugh's \\"bravery\\" and \\"sacrifice\\". Anselms survivors went on to serve in the North African and Italian campaigns. As they returned to Britain after the war, their recollections of Pugh started to appear in the News of the World and the Daily Express. In 1947 his bravery was honoured with the George Cross, which King George VI presented to his widow Amy Pugh and Alastair Pugh, one of his sons, at Buckingham Palace. At RAF Bridgnorth Pugh's example continued to be remembered until the station closed in 1963. Pugh's George Cross citation states: > The Reverend H. C. Pugh, after seeing service in this country, was posted to > Takoradi and embarked on H.M.T. Anselm, carrying over 1,300 passengers; for > West Africa at the end of June, 1941.

Released in 1972, it marked the group's first collaborations with regular sound engineer Andre Jacquemin as well as musician Neil Innes, who had previously appeared with future members of the Python team on Do Not Adjust Your Set. The album contains many sketches from the third series of Flying Circus, one (Fish Licence) from the second as well as an abridged version of \\"The Tale of Happy Valley\\" from the second German show. The album was released midway through the broadcast of Series 3, whose sketches featured on the album were all from its first half, with the exception of \\"Dennis Moore\\" which aired a month later and therefore made its debut here. The oldest sketch on the album, Eric Idle's \\"Radio Quiz Game\\", dates back to I'm Sorry I'll Read That Again where it was performed by Graeme Garden - Idle having subsequently performed the sketch himself on two editions of Do Not Adjust Your Set. The rest of the material was specially written for the album. Among the proposed ideas for the record were a 'B' side consisting of four concentric tracks, all starting at different places on the first groove, so that the listener could get any of one of four different versions of the 'B' side\\".Palin, Michael Diaries 1969‚Äì1979: The Python Years, p.85, 2006, Weidenfeld & Nicolson. When this proved impossible, a three-sided 'B' side was attempted. But as Jacquemin later explained, \\"That's why you hear 'and now a massage from the Swedish Prime Minister' three times on it. Each groove was going to start with that, but unfortunately, the three grooves ran into each other towards the centre of the record. In the end, we cut all the bits together for a standard, single- groove side.\\"\\"And Now For Something Completely Different: The Recorded Works Of Monty Python\\", Record Collector, No.193, September 1995 A year later, a less ambitious version of the same idea, with just two concentric tracks, would be used on the next Monty Python LP, The Monty Python Matching Tie and Handkerchief. The cover design, by Terry Gilliam, pictured an elongated arm which wrapped around both sides of the sleeve. Its hand can be seen trying to catch a six-breasted woman with butterfly wings. The inner sleeve pictured the covers of sixteen fictional albums on one side, with the other containing the album credits and lyrics to the \\"Yangtse Song\\". The original British vinyl release included a separate 33rpm 7\\" flexi-disc entitled Teach Yourself Heath, housed in a sleeve featuring a picture of then Prime Minister Edward Heath. The album was trailed three weeks earlier on 17 November 1972 by the 7\\" single Eric The Half-A-Bee/Yangtse Song (CB.200), credited to \\"Monty Python With Niel (sic) Innes\\". These were alternate mono mixes of two tracks which would appear in stereo on the album. The latter song had an added karaoke section with additional linking from Michael Palin. \\"Summarize Proust Competition\\" was recorded but cut from the album, although a reference to the Proust Song remains on the album's inner sleeve. The track was released five years later on the Instant Record Collection compilation. Another cut sketch, \\"Bells\\", eventually found its way onto 1980's Contractual Obligation Album. As with the previous record, initial UK pressings had a unique label. Both sides featured the \\"Mad Hatter\\" Charisma design, with the first side listed as \\"'A' side and half 'B' side\\" (in reference to the album's single release) and a list of contents by \\"a Harley Street Dentist\\". The second side was listed as \\"This side\\" and contained a series of teeth-cleaning instructions. Later pressings were issued with the standard Charisma label, omitting the dentally-themed text. The US version, released in 1973, had the \\"Harley Street Dentist\\" material from the UK A-side label switched to Side B, with the A side eschewing the teeth-cleaning instructions of the UK version in favour of a red label containing the actual track listing for both sides. This, too, was different from the UK version, removing the tracks \\"How To Do It\\" and \\"Radio Quiz Game\\" from Side 1 and placing them on Side 2. The album reached No.39 in the UK album chart. The track \\"Wonderful World of Sound\\" features the earliest known citation of the phrase \\"something for the weekend\\", a euphemistic reference to condoms used by barbers when offering them to their clientele.

He helped to destroy Nazi Germany‚Äôs espionage program in the United States by defecting to the American cause, but was tried and convicted of treason and espionage. Early life George John Dasch was born in Speyer, Germany. He entered a Roman Catholic seminary at the age of 13 to study for the priesthood. However, he was expelled the following year. Lying about his age, he enlisted in the Imperial German Army and served in Belgium during the final months of World War I. In 1923, he entered the United States illegally through a port in Philadelphia by ship as a stowaway then stayed in New York City. For four years, he drifted among several New York restaurants with one season spent at a hotel in Miami Beach. In 1927, Dasch enlisted as a private in the U.S. Army Air Corps. He was assigned to the 5th Composite Group of Newton field in Honolulu and served with the 72nd Bombardment Squadron, but after a year, he purchased himself out of the Army, receiving an honorable discharge. He then worked as a waiter in San Francisco, Sacramento, Los Angeles, and back in New York City. In 1930, he married Rose Marie Guille, an American citizen. Dasch reenlisted in the US Army in 1936. Dasch was stationed at Ft. Ontario in Oswego New York. George Dasch served with the 1st Infantry Division, 28th regiment, L Company. While stationed at Fort Ontario Dasch met a young local girl by the name of Charlotte Holliday. George Dasch and Charlotte Holliday were married in Oswego at St. Paul's Lutheran Church in the parsonage in March 1936. According to City and church records George married Charlotte Holliday using the alias of George Henry Aldasch to hide his bigamy. (Illegal marriage). As George was still married to Rosemarie Guille at that time. George resided with his new wife Charlotte Aldasch at her father Jay Holliday's home located at 11 Murray St in Oswego NY while serving at Fort Ontario. On October 20, 1937 George and Charlotte had a son named Howard Elliot Aldasch. Their son was born at their residence of 11 Murray St in Oswego New York. After the birth of their son Howard, the marriage became tumultuous. Some time in 1938 George Dasch left the US Army abandoning his wife and son. Dasch returned to Germany in 1938. Charlotte Aldasch would eventually learn the real identity of her husband in 1942 when Dasch turned himself in to the FBI. Horrified by this turn of events and fearing for their son's safety, Charlotte sent their son Howard Aldasch to live anonymously with distant relations in rural Madison New York. Dasch's last communication with his wife Charlotte and his son Howard was via a lawyer and military officer in 1955. At that time Dasch was trying to regain entry back into the United States which was denied by FBI Chief J Edgar Hoover.  Operation Pastorius = Preparation for espionage = Dasch and the others were trained for espionage activities in a German High Command school on an estate at Quenz Lake, near Berlin, Germany. The agents received three weeks of intensive sabotage training and were instructed in the manufacture and use of explosives, incendiary material and various forms of mechanical, chemical, and electrical delayed timing devices. Considerable time was spent developing complete background \\"histories\\" they were to use in the United States. They were encouraged to converse in English and to read American newspapers and magazines so no suspicion would be aroused if they were interrogated while in the United States. = Espionage activities = On May 26, 1942, Dasch and his team (Ernest Peter Burger, Heinrich Harm Heink, and Richard Quirin) left by submarine from Lorient, France. They landed on Long Island, New York shortly after midnight on June 12. They were wearing German Navy uniforms to avoid being shot as spies if captured during the landing. Once ashore, they changed to civilian clothes and buried their uniforms and other equipment. Early that morning, John C. Cullen, a Coast Guardsman from the station in Amagansett, New York spotted Dasch and three others posing as fisherman off the coast of Long Island with a raft. He saw that the men were armed and also noticed a submerged submarine. The men offered him a $260 bribe to keep quiet. He took the bribe, but alerted his superiors. By the time an armed patrol returned to the site, the Germans had taken the Long Island Rail Road train from the Amagansett station into Manhattan, New York City, where they checked in and stayed at a hotel. A search of the beach revealed concealed explosives, timers, blasting caps, incendiary devices, cigarettes, and the military uniforms. It was realized that German agents had landed on American soil. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) director J. Edgar Hoover were immediately alerted, and the FBI conducted a massive manhunt. Hoover ordered that all information be kept secret to avoid public panic and to prevent the spies from knowing they had been discovered. However, the FBI did not know exactly where the Germans were going. Defection to the United States George John Dasch was by now unhappy with the Nazi regime. He eventually talked to one of his compatriots, a naturalized American citizen named Ernst Peter Burger, about defecting to the United States. Their plan was to surrender immediately to the FBI. Dasch ordered Burger to stay and keep an eye on the German agents. On June 15, Dasch called the FBI office in New York from a pay-telephone on Manhattan's Upper West Side to convey the information to Director Hoover. When the FBI agent did not believe his story, Dasch hung up and took a train to Washington D.C. Four days later and booked in at the Mayflower Hotel. He then went to the FBI headquarters asking to speak to Hoover. Dasch tried to tell the truth to the FBI officials, but they did not believe his story. While Dasch was at FBI headquarters, the FBI sent agents to his hotel room, where they found $82,500 in cash (worth more than $1 million in 2017 dollars). Dasch was arrested and interrogated for eight days. He disclosed the locations of the other men in the sabotage operation including Burger. He revealed that the goals of the sabotage program had been to disrupt war industries and launch a wave of terror by planting explosives in railway stations, department stores, and public places. Armed with the information Dasch provided, the FBI arrested Burger and six other German agents within the following week. The FBI withheld the true circumstances of their arrest prior to the trial of the eight men, including the fact that they did not actually consummate their plans of sabotage.Sullivan and Feldman's Constitutional Law, 18th, 2013 Supplement (University Casebook Series) Aftermath Dasch, Ernst Peter Burger, and six others ‚Äì Edward John Kerling, Heinrich Harm Heinck, Richard Quirin, Werner Thiel, Hermann Otto Neubauer, and Herbert Hans Haupt (who had landed in Florida to meet with Dasch and Burger) ‚Äì were tried by a military commission appointed by President Roosevelt on July 8, 1942 and convicted of sabotage and sentenced to death. FBI Director Hoover and Attorney General Biddle appealed to President Roosevelt, who commuted the sentence to life imprisonment for Burger, and thirty years for Dasch. The others were executed in the electric chair in Washington D.C Jail on 8 August 1942. In 1948, President Harry S. Truman had both Burger and Dasch released and deported to Germany. They were not welcomed back because they were regarded as traitors who had caused the death of their comrades. Although they had been promised pardons by Hoover in exchange for their cooperation, both men died without ever receiving them. Dasch wrote an account of his involvement with Operation Pastorius (‚ÄúEight Spies Against America,‚Äù Publisher: R.M. McBride Co., 1959. Library of Congress catalog # 59-13612). He died in 1992 at the age of 89 in Ludwigshafen.

The ward is bounded by the River Usk to the west and north, The Moorings, Badminton Road, Reynolds Close, Rembrandt Way, Constable Drive, Heather Road, Kelly Road, Merlin Crescent, Avalon Drive, across St Julian's Road and Norfolk Road to the east, Christchurch Road, Church Road, Clarence Place and Newport Bridge to the south. The ward includes the districts of Barnardtown, Riverside, and most of St. Julians (the rest being in Beechwood ward). The area is governed by the Newport City Council. History The Anglican parish church for St Julian's is dedicated to the martyred Saints of Julius and Aaron and sits mid-way along Heather Road and the Roman Catholic church on Beaufort Road is dedicated to St Julius. St Julian's Methodist Church is situated at the junction of Caerleon Road with St Julian's Avenue; St Julian's Baptist Church is in Beaufort Road. The roads in the post-war St Julian's estate are named after famous painters, where as the older inter-war estate streets are named after the members of the Firbank family who owned the land from 1869-1926. St Julian's itself is named after Saint Julius of Caerleon, the Roman martyr. Education St Julians has two primary schools, namely Glan Usk Primary School (formerly Durham Road Infant School and Durham Road Junior School) and St Julians Primary School. Glan Usk Primary School opened in January 2010, after receiving ¬£9.7m in funding from the Welsh Government. The development is however controversial as it is situated on a former 1930s and 1960s industrial site at the Glebelands in the western part of St Julians. The new school also provides nursery school places, following the closure of Rockfield Nursery. St Julian's secondary school draws its pupils mainly from Eveswell, Glan Usk, Maindee, and St Julian‚Äôs Primary Schools. St. Julian's House Built in 1480 on the site of a chapel that housed the mortal remains of Saint Julius, the house and estate was established by Sir George Herbert (c1462-1504). It was owned and lived in by the Herbert family until about 1720 when the Tudor mansion was downsized to a farmhouse and parts of the estate became derelict. St. Julian's was then passed onto the Duke of Beaufort who leased the farmhouse out in the early 19th century. In 1869, the estate was purchased at a Newport auction by Joseph Firbank (1819-1886), a railway contractor from Durham, for ¬£38,000. In 1880 he rebuilds St. Julian's into a Victorian farmhouse, retaining the Tudor porch and the crucifix layout. He also builds a grander and more modern mansion south of Caerleon Road adjacent to Llanllecha Farm, called (Upper) St. Julians while the original house becomes Lower or Old St. Julians. This is then leased out again to farm tenants from 1892. In 1933, Upper St. Julian's is demolished for a new housing development on Heather Road and following the Second World War the older house is converted into a motor garage. The land surrounding the house has by this point been sold off and built on, leaving St. Julian's to become completely derelict by the 1970s. It was eventually demolished in 1980 and Marina Court is now situated on the site.

It was recorded on the final night of their four-week runPalin, M., Diaries 1969-1979: The Python Years, p.160 at the Drury Lane Theatre in London earlier that year and edited onto disc with new studio linking material by Eric Idle and Michael Palin. The majority of the sketches are from Flying Circus and vary slightly from their television counterparts, although \\"Cocktail Bar\\" was written for the third series but not used. The team also revived sketches from At Last The 1948 Show, including \\"Secret Service\\", \\"Wrestling\\" and \\"Four Yorkshiremen\\" - the latter on its way to being adopted as a Python standard. Neil Innes provided the musical interludes, while Eric Idle's then wife Lyn Ashley replaced regular Python actress Carol Cleveland in supporting roles. As with its predecessor, the second side of the original UK vinyl release had a cryptic message by George Peckham etched onto the runout groove, which read \\"THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF PORKY TRISHY MELLY YEAH\\". This message was missing from the second pressings, the label of which added the musical titles used on the album (notably for the many songs referenced in \\"Election Special\\"). To promote the album's release, a double-sided 33rpm Flexi disc was issued free with the 25 May 1974 edition of New Musical Express entitled Monty Python's Tiny Black Round Thing which contained an extended version of \\"Election Special\\" and \\"Lumberjack Song\\" with new linking material from Michael Palin. The album was the group's most successful to date, reaching No.19 in the UK charts.http://www.officialcharts.com/search/albums/live%20at%20drury%20lane/ The album was released in Canada in 1975 (distributed by GRT of Canada Ltd. 9211-4) but was not issued in the US until 1994, when it was included in the box set The Instant Monty Python CD Collection. Until then, the only live Python album released in the US had been Monty Python Live at City Center, released in 1976. The album's cover was designed by Terry Gilliam's assistant Katy Hepburn (misspelled as \\"Hebbern\\" on the back cover). Three decades later, it made a surprise appearance in Gilliam's 2005 film Tideland, where it can be seen at the front of a box of LPs. The performance featured Eric Idle muttering \\"Breakaway!\\" during the \\"Nudge, Nudge\\" sketch (Idle was advertising the Breakaway chocolate bar at this time), which resulted in an unexpectedly strong laugh from the audience. This moment was removed from subsequent compilations. Although originally released in stereo, the 2006 special edition CD has the whole album mixed into mono. This is the only one of the 2006 reissues to contain no new material, with the exception of an interview placed at the end of the disc.

Types There are three types: *Destination open-jaw, where a passenger flies from one city to another, but returns to the original city from a different place. For example, depart London to New York, but on the return trip fly from Philadelphia to London. *Origin open-jaw, where the passenger leaves from one city to another but returns to a different place. For example, flying from London to New York, but returning from New York to Manchester. *Double open-jaw, where two totally separate fares exist. For example, flying from London to New York, but on the return trip flying from Boston to Manchester. Using different airports in the same city is not considered an open-jaw, so a passenger on a London to JFK trip who returned from Newark would still be a simple round trip as both airports are considered to be in New York. ARNK The open gaps between the cities show on the itinerary as ARNK, the same code that shows on an airline or agency's Global Distribution System. The term (pronounced arunk) means \\"arrival unknown\\". The reason for this is that airline reservation systems (and major GDSs) require the segments following on sequentially, so arriving at one city, and then departing from another, will cause the system to return an error message. The ARNK field tells the system that this is intentional, and also allows for the ticketing system to blank the unused coupons of a ticket. A typical destination open-jaw would look like this on an itinerary, with the ARNK on the second segment to show that it is not being flown on that ticket. * \`Segment 1: 11-NOV: SFO/IAD (San Francisco to Washington-Dulles)\` * \`Segment 2: ARNK: Arrival Unknown or Surface Transportation from IAD to PHL\` * \`Segment 3: 15-NOV: PHL/SFO (Philadelphia to San Francisco)\` Reasons for using open-jaw tickets In some cases, this type of arrangement is needed for boat cruises that do not return to the departure city. In other cases, the traveller wishes to explore between two points and using alternative transport (e.g. buses, trains, ferries or flights on another ticket). For example, a traveller might fly from London to Bangkok, travel around Thailand by public transport and fly back home to London from Phuket. Another example would be a traveller flying from New York City to London, travelling around different countries in Europe by taking buses / trains or low-cost carrier flights, then returning from Vilnius. Open-jaw tickets are a flexible and relatively inexpensive way of flying as they are priced as a round-trip ticket, in most cases less expensive than purchasing two one-way flights between the destinations visited. Another market commonly traveled under an open-jaw itinerary is the one of local one-way tours. Take, for example, a tour of Florida, where a traveler flying into Jacksonville, Orlando, or Miami rents a car or joins a bus tour at their arrival airport, and returns the car or ends the tour in the town from which they will be flying home. Restrictions Some routing restrictions can apply to open-jaw tickets. The most common restriction is that the open-jaw segments must be shorter than the flown segments. In some circumstances, the destination and return origin must be in the same IATA region, or may be restricted to the same country.

These peoples and their territories were incorporated into the Roman Province of Hispania Tarraconensis in the year 19 BC, following the Cantabrian Wars. Name ' is a Latinized form of a local name, presumably meaning \\"Highlanders\\" and deriving from the reconstructed root *cant- (\\"mountain\\") in Ancient Ligurian. Geography Location of the Cantabri during the Cantabrian Wars, in relationship to today's Cantabria, along with the tribes that lived there, the neighboring peoples, towns and geographical features, according to classical sources. Cantabria, the land of the Cantabri, originally comprised much of the highlands of the northern Spanish Atlantic coast, including the whole of modern Cantabria province, eastern Asturias, nearby mountainous regions of Castile and Le√≥n, the northern of province of Palencia and province of Burgos and northeast of province of Le√≥n. Following the Roman conquest, this area was, however, much reduced, making up only Cantabria and eastern Asturias. History=Origins= The ancestors of the Cantabri were thought by the Romans to have migrated to the Iberian Peninsula around the 4th Century BC,Pliny the Elder, Historia Naturalis, III, 29.Strabo, Geographikon, III, 4, 12. and were said by them to be more mixed than most peninsular Celtic peoples, their eleven or so tribes, assessed by Roman writers according to their names, were supposed to have included Gallic, Celtiberian, Indo-Aryan, Aquitanian, and Ligurian origins. A detailed analysis of place-names in ancient Cantabria shows a strong Celtic element along with an almost equally strong \\"Para-Celtic\\" element (both Indo- European) and thus disproves the idea of a substantial pre-Indo-European or Basque presence in the region. This supports the earlier view that Untermann considered the most plausible, coinciding with archaeological evidence put forward by Ruiz-G√°lvez in 1998, that the Celtic settlement of the Iberian Peninsula was made by people who arrived via the Atlantic Ocean in an area between Brittany and the mouth of the River Garonne, finally settling along the Galician and Cantabrian coast. =Early history= Regarded as savage and untamable mountaineers, the Cantabri long defied the Roman legions and made a name for themselves for their independent spirit and freedom. Indeed, Cantabri warriors were regarded as being tough and fiercest fighters,Florus, Epitomae Historiae Romanae, II, 33, 46-47. suitable for mercenary employment,Silius Italicus, Punica, V, 192. but prone to banditry.Strabo, Geographikon, III, 3, 8. The earliest references to them are found in the texts of ancient historians such as LivyLivy, Ab Urbe Condita, 27: 43-49. and Polybius,Polybius, Istorion, 11: 1-3. who mention Cantabrian mercenaries in Carthaginian service fighting at the Battle of the Metaurus in 207 BC, and Silius,Silius Italicus, Punica, 3 who talks about a chieftain named Larus recruited by Mago and a Cantabrian contingent in Hannibal's army. Another author, Cornelius Nepos,Cornelius Nepos, De Viris Illustribus, 47. claims that the Cantabrian tribes first submitted to Rome upon Cato the Elder‚Äôs campaigns in Celtiberia in 195 BC.Though most modern historians have cast serious doubts upon the veracity of this particular episode, since other sources (Livy, Appian, Polybius) don‚Äôt mention it at all. In any case, such was their reputation that when a battered Roman army under consul Gaius Hostilius Mancinus was besieging Numantia in 137 BC, the rumor of the approach of a large combined Cantabri-Vaccaei relief force was enough to cause the rout of 20,000 panic-stricken Roman legionaries, forcing Mancinus to surrender under humiliating peace terms.Plutarch, Tiberius Gracchus, 5, 4.Appian, Romaika, 83. Santander. By the 1st century BC they comprised eleven or so tribes‚Äî, , Camarici or Tamarici, Concani, Coniaci or Conisci, Morecani, Noegi, Orgenomesci, Plentuisii, Salaeni, Vadinienses, and Vellici or Velliques‚Äîgathered into a tribal confederacy with the town of Aracillum (Castro de Espina del Gallego, Sierra del Escudo ‚Äì Cantabria), located at the strategic Besaya river valley, as their political seat. Other important Cantabrian strongholds included Villeca/Vellica ( ‚Äì Palencia), Bergida (Castro de ‚Äì Palencia) and Amaya/Amaia ( ‚Äì Burgos). In early 1st century BC, the Cantabri began to play a double game by lending their services to individual Roman generals on occasion but, at same time, supported rebellions within Roman Spanish provinces and carried out raids in times of unrest. This opportunistic policy led them to side with Pompey during the final phase of the Sertorian Wars (82‚Äì72 BC), and they continued to follow the Pompeian cause until the defeat of his generals Afranius and Petreius at the battle of Ilerda (L√©rida) in 49 BC.Caesar, De Bello Civili, I: 43-46.Lucan, Pharsalia, IV: 8-10. Prior to that, the Cantabri had unsuccessfully intervened in the Gallic Wars by sending in 56 BC an army to help the Aquitani tribes of south-eastern Gaul against Publius Crassus, the son of Marcus Crassus serving under Julius Caesar.Caesar, De Bello Gallico, 3, 23. Under the leadership of the chieftain Corocotta, the Cantabri‚Äôs own predatory raids on the Vaccaei, Turmodigi and AutrigonesPaulus Orosius, Historiarum Adversus Paganus, 6: 21, 1. whose rich territories they coveted, according to Florus,Florus, Epitomae Historiae Romanae, 2: 33, 46. coupled with their backing of a Vaccaei anti-Roman revolt in 29 BC, ultimately led to the outbreak of the First Cantabrian Wars, which resulted in their conquest and partial annihilation by Emperor Augustus.Suetonius, Augustus, 21. - Tiberius saw his first military experience in the campaign against the Cantabri of 25 BC, as a tribune of the soldiers. Tiberius, 9. The remaining Cantabrian population and their tribal lands were absorbed into the newly created Transduriana Province. Nevertheless, the harsh measures devised by Augustus and implemented by his general Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa to pacify the province in the aftermath of the campaign only contributed to further instability in Cantabria. Near-constant tribal uprisings (including a serious slave revolt in 20 BC that quickly spread to neighboring Asturias)Cassius Dio, Romaik√© Historia, 54: 11, 1. and guerrilla warfare continued to plague the Cantabrian lands until the early 1st century AD, when the region was granted a form of local self-rule upon being included in the new Hispania Tarraconensis province. =Romanization= Although the Romans founded colonies and established military garrisons at Castra Legio Pisoraca (camp of Legio IIII Macedonica ‚Äì Palencia), Octaviolca (near Valdeolea ‚Äì Cantabria) and Iuliobriga (Retortillo ‚Äì Reinosa), Cantabria never became fully romanized and its people preserved many aspects of Celtic language, religion and culture well into the Roman period. The Cantabri did not lose their warrior skills either, providing auxiliary troops (Auxilia) to the Roman Imperial army for decades and these troops participated in Emperor Claudius' invasion of Britain in AD 43‚Äì60. =Early Middle Ages= The Cantabri re-emerged, as did their neighbors the Astures, amid the chaos of the Migration Period of the late 4th century. Thenceforward the Cantabri started to be Christianized and were violently crushed by the Visigoths in the 6th century. However, Cantabria and the Cantabri are heard of many decades later in the context of the Visigoth wars against the Vascones (late 7th century)., p. 114. They only became fully Latinized in their language and culture after the Muslim Conquest of Iberia in the 8th century. Culture According to Pliny the ElderPliny the Elder, Historia Naturalis, 34, 112; 149; 158. Cantabria also contained gold, silver, tin, lead and iron mines, as well as magnetite and amber, but little is known about them; StraboStrabo, Geographikon, III, 3, 7. also mentions salt extraction in mines, such as the ones existent around Cabez√≥n de la Sal. One of his most famous and strange customs was the couvade, when, after the birth of a child, the mother had to get up and the father go to bed, to be cared for by the mother. Religion Cantabrian stele, carved in sandstone (1.70 m in diameter and 0.32 m thick) Literary and epigraphic evidence confirms that, like their Gallaeci and Astures neighbors, the Cantabri were polytheistic, worshipping a vast and complex pantheon of male and female Indo-European deities in sacred oak or pine woods, mountains, water-courses and small rural sanctuaries. Druidism does not appear to have been practiced by the Cantabri, though there is enough evidence for the existence of an organized priestly class who performed elaborated rites, which included ritual steam baths, festive dances, oracles, divination, human and animal sacrifices. In this respect, StraboStrabo, Geographikon, III, 3, 7. mentions that the peoples of the north-west sacrificed horses to an unnamed God of War, and both HoraceHorace, Odes, III, 4, 35 and Silius ItalicusSilius Italicus, Hispania, III, 3, 161. added that the Concani had the custom of drinking the horse‚Äôs blood at the ceremony.

It was established in 1802 by William Fullarton to provide housing for workers on the coalfields of his estate. Fullarton's father had worked as an employee of the British East India Company, and the town is named after the city of Patna in the Bihar province of India. Patna lies southeast of Ayr on the A713 to Castle Douglas at its junction with the road to Kirkmichael just north of Dalmellington. Patna lies between the villages of Polnessan and Waterside, and the River Doon flows through it. Patna Primary School is a non-denominational school. St Xavier's Primary School, a Catholic primary school, was formerly in Waterside but has been moved into Patna Primary School, and is attended by pupils from Dalmellington, Bellsbank and Maybole. A secondary school, Doon Academy, is located in the nearby village of Dalmellington. Patna has a small library and fitness gym, a community centre, a health centre, some shops, a football field, a bar ‚ÄúThe Wheatsheaf Inn‚Äù, access to numerous country walks, an orange and masonic lodge and a golf club (although the golf course is now closed). The River Doon is popular with local anglers. There are two bridges within the village, used as vehicle and pedestrian crossing points over the River Doon. These bridges are known locally as the 'ol brig' and 'new brig'. The village was served until 1964 by Patna railway station. The platforms have been demolished and nothing remains of the station.

Since September 21, 2020, the program airs every Mondays to Fridays from 8:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. on TeleRadyo. History Kabayan (Kapangyarihan ng Mamamayan, Balita at Talakayan) premiered in late 1986 on DZMM-AM with Noli de Castro, coinciding with his move from late-afternoons to early mornings after DZMM Balita (renamed Radyo Patrol Balita). The program focuses on issues relating to the political and social situation in the Philippines. Its efforts resulted to the show becoming DZMM's top-rating radio program. In February 2001, it had to end its run in order to allow de Castro to run for the Senate. Replacement programs and eventually Todo Balita took over the timeslot. On July 12, 2010, Kabayan returned to DZMM with de Castro as its current host, replacing Todo Balita. On January 10, 2011, Kabayan was moved to the 6:00 a.m. time slot, combining it with Radyo Patrol Balita: Alas Siyete, wherein de Castro was joined by Ted Failon as the co-anchor of the newscast. In January 2020, the program updated its OBB and title card on DZMM TeleRadyo, in preparation for the 10th anniversary celebration of the program's return to air. From March 18, 2020 to May 1, 2020, Kabayan and Radyo Patrol Balita Alas-Siyete were simulcast on ABS-CBN from 6:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m., temporarily replacing Umagang Kay Ganda as provisional programming, due to the coronavirus pandemic. The program was also simulcast alongside Radyo Patrol Balita: Alas Siyete (later TeleBalita and currently TeleRadyo Balita) from June 15, 2020 to September 18, 2020 on Kapamilya Channel. On September 21, 2020, Kabayan began airing at its new timeslot at 8:00 am, limiting it back to a runtime of one hour, to make way for the return of Gising Pilipinas at 6:00 am. The move effectively ended its simulcast on Kapamilya Channel. Format Kabayan is a commentary program where de Castro tackles the latest issues. Among the notable features of the program is its signature closing song, What a Wonderful World by Louis Armstrong and Kenny G. The ending song was temporarily shelved in January 2019 and replaced by random old songs chosen by de Castro. However, it was reverted into the original song after a while. Since May 8, 2020 the song was replaced again by Kapamilya Forever (and later Tinig ng mga Nawalan), in support of ABS-CBN and DZMM when both stations were closed due to a cease and desist order issued by the NTC. From 2011 to 2020, the program used to be combined with Radyo Patrol Balita: Alas Siyete (later rebranded as TeleBalita) from 7:00 a.m. to 7:30 a.m. with Ted Failon, who was later replaced by Ricky Rosales and then Joyce Balancio after leaving the network on August 31, 2020. On some occasions when de Castro would not appear on his program due to special assignments and other days off, an alternate anchorman like Johnson Manabat, or Ricky Rosales hosts the program. The TeleRadyo Balita portion would be anchored by Balancio and the alternate anchorman. Among his former relievers were the late Lito Villarosa, Ted Failon, and Gerry Baja - with Villarosa being the most notable due to his vocal resemblance with de Castro; this lasted until 1993 when his role as lead reliever was taken over by Ted Failon.

The doctrine states that Jesus died as a propitiation for the benefit of mankind without exception. It is a doctrine distinct from other elements of the Calvinist acronym TULIP and is contrary to the Calvinist doctrine of limited atonement. A doctrinal issue that divides Christians is the question of the extent of the atonement. This question typically goes as follows: \\"Did Christ bear the sins of the elect alone on the cross, or did his death expiate the sins of all human beings?\\" Those who take this view read scriptures such as John 3:16; ; ; ; to say that the Bible teaches unlimited atonement.  Historical background  In response to the Remonstrants' Five articles of Remonstrance, the Synod of Dort published the Canons of Dort which included limited atonement. One of the stronger, more vocal proponents of unlimited atonement was Methodist leader John Wesley. George Whitefield opposed the view. The namesake of the Calvinist systematic theological viewpoint, John Calvin, seemingly expressed an unlimited atonement position in several passages from his published Commentaries.Paul Hartog, A Word for the World: Calvin on the Extent of the Atonement (Schaumburg: Regular Baptist Press, 2009).  Doctrine  The terms unlimited, universal, and general are somewhat of a misnomer and have been adopted primarily to distinguish this doctrine from a Calvinist understanding of limited atonement. More accurately, the call of the Gospel is universal and there are no limits on who can believe through faith, but the legal payment is still regarded as limited only to those that respond through faith in Jesus. Thus, it is not the same as the doctrine of universal salvation, which holds that all souls will ultimately be reconciled to God, irrespective of faith. The following statements regarding what it states and what it does not state are subject to close scrutiny of which many distinguished theologians on both sides of this issue disagree. ; What it states * The purpose of the atonement was universal‚ÄîJesus died on behalf of all people, not just the elect. * The atonement makes a way for all to respond to the Gospel call‚ÄîPart of the effect of the atonement is the restoration of the ability to respond to God's call of salvation (see Prevenient grace). * Salvation is available for all‚ÄîThe doctrine of unlimited atonement rejects the predeterminism associated with Calvinism and states that every human has the opportunity to accept Jesus through faith. * The atonement legally pays for the sins of those who believe on Jesus‚ÄîOnly those who believe on Jesus are forgiven‚Äîonly the believers' sins are paid ; What it does not state * Jesus paid the penalty for those who deny faith in Him, and His death was a substitutionary atonement for those who deny Him‚ÄîThough the term unlimited atonement can easily give the incorrect assumption that Jesus' payment encompassed all people, unlimited atonement maintains a limit on the legal effect. Jesus' death was indeed an offer of a substitutionary atonement to all, but this offer was resistible; though salvation is offered to all, not all are saved. Amyraldism (commonly called \\"four-point Calvinism\\" holds to a view of Unlimited atonement that is very similar but not synonymous with the traditional Arminian understanding) teaches that God has provided Christ's atonement for all alike, but seeing that none would believe on their own, he then elects those whom he will bring to faith in Christ, thereby preserving the Calvinist doctrine of the unconditional election of individuals. Unlimited atonement has a number of important points in common with traditional formulations of limited atonement. Both positions affirm that: * The call of salvation can genuinely be made universally * Jesus paid the penalty only for those who have faith in Him * Jesus' death was a substitutionary atonement only for those who accept Him  Biblical passages  All quotes from the NKJV unless otherwise noted, emphasis added: = Scriptures used in support of unlimited atonement = These are Scriptures commonly used by those who support Unlimited atonement: * ‚Äî\\"The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\\" * ‚Äî\\"And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life. For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved. He who believes in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.\\" * ‚Äî\\"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.\\" * ‚Äî\\"For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus\\" * ‚Äî\\"Therefore, as one trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all men.\\" * ‚Äî\\"For the love of Christ compels us, because we judge thus: that if One died for all, then all died; and He died for all, that those who live should live no longer for themselves, but for Him who died for them and rose again.\\" * ‚Äî\\"[I]n Christ God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation.\\" * ‚Äî\\"Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners‚Äîof whom I am the worst.\\" * ‚ÄîFor this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. For there is one God and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus, who gave Himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.\\" * ‚Äî\\"For to this end we both labor and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of those who believe.\\" * ‚Äî\\"For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people.\\" * ‚Äî\\"But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, now crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone.\\" * ‚Äî\\"They will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the sovereign Lord who bought them.\\" This appears to indicate that Christ \\"bought\\" some who are not among the elect. * ‚Äî\\"The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.\\" * ‚Äî\\"And He [Christ] Himself is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the whole world.\\" *‚Äî\\"And we have seen and we testify that the Father has sent His Son as the world‚Äôs Savior.\\" = Scriptures used to criticize unlimited atonement = These are Scriptures commonly used by those who deny Unlimited atonement: * \\"‚ÄîBut he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. To him the doorkeeper opens, and the sheep hear his voice; and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. And when he brings out his own sheep, he goes before them; and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice. Yet they will by no means follow a stranger, but will flee from him, for they do not know the voice of strangers...I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd gives His life for the sheep...I am the good shepherd; and I know My sheep, and am known by My own. As the Father knows Me, even so I know the Father; and I lay down My life for the sheep.\\" This is usually reconciled by pointing out that Jesus died for everyone in theory, but He did it particularly for those who would follow Him. * ‚Äî\\"...I do not pray for the world but for those whom You have given Me, for they are Yours.\\" This is usually reconciled by claiming that this does not refer to the atonement itself. * Acts 20:28‚Äî\\"Therefore take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God which He purchased with His own blood.\\" This again is often reconciled by saying that Christ's death is only effective for those who come to the church, even though it is potentially effective for all. * ‚Äî\\"Who shall bring a charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies. Who is he who condemns? It is Christ who died, and furthermore is also risen, who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us.\\" Attempts to reconcile this may point to the fact that in the unlimited view, Christ still only intercedes for those who follow Him. * ‚Äî\\"Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself for her.\\" This is usually reconciled by saying that He did it particularly for those who would follow Him, although it was potentially effective for all.

She was introduced in Night Warriors: Darkstalkers' Revenge in 1995. Her character is based on vampires of Chinese folklore known as jiƒÅngshƒ´, into which she was transformed when she was magically merged with her twin sister Mei-Ling (), known in Japan as . Together, they fight to free the cursed spirit of their dead mother and to destroy the monsters preying on the people of China. Hsien-Ko has since become one of the franchise's more popular characters, garnering positive fan and critical reception. She has also appeared on official Darkstalkers merchandise and as a playable character in several games outside the series. Appearances=In video games= According to her Night Warriors: Darkstalkers' Revenge backstory, Hsien-Ko and her twin sister, Mei-Ling, were born in 1730s China (Qing dynasty). Hsien-Ko was sixteen at a time when undead spirits arose and attacked a rural village. When their mother was killed in her attempt to save the village, the twins, both teenagers, fought to release her soul from the dark by using a forbidden spell called \\"Igyo Tenshin no Jutsu.\\" This, in turn, converted them into a jiƒÅngshƒ´ (\\"hopping corpse\\"), a type of Chinese zombie. Mei-Ling is actually the f√∫ (\\"ward-paper\\"), a parchment-like talisman that is attached to the front of Hsien-Ko's hat. While the conversion infused Hsien-Ko with magical powers, they are formidable enough that Mei-Ling's presence as the ward-paper is required to keep them in check. The twins' transformation results in them fighting as a Darkhunter as a combined single unit of mind and body. In Hsien- Ko's Darkstalkers' Revenge ending, the girls free their mother's soul, albeit at the cost of their own lives, but their mother, as a reward, enables them to be reborn as infants in a new life. In Hsien-Ko's Darkstalkers 3 storyline, which makes no mention of the twins' mother, they discover that they are connected psychically after experiencing the same dream on the night of their sixteenth birthday, but the very next night they both suffer a nightmare and fall into a coma, which in turn sees their collective consciousness transported into Majigen. After awakening in this foreign territory, they find they have gained new powers simply from unleashing the power of an unspecified forbidden spell and team up to fight their way out of the realm. Hsien-Ko has made several other appearances in crossover titles. She appears as a playable character in Namco √ó Capcom, and is paired with Fong Ling from Resident Evil: Dead Aim as a single unit, while in Project X Zone she is paired up with Frank West from Dead Rising. Hsien-Ko is also playable in Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo, Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix, SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Clash, SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters 2 Expand Edition, SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters DS, Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds (where Hsien-Ko and Mei-Ling arrive to ask Doctor Strange to help them save their mother's soul), Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, Onimusha Soul (redesigned for a feudal Japan setting), and Street Fighter: Puzzle Spirits. Hsien-Ko has her own mobile game, Lei-Lei's Magical Hammer, released in the West simply as Magical Hammer and later remade as Line Drop: Spirit Hunter Lei-Lei. She was originally planned to be playable in Tatsunoko vs. Capcom, but was dropped due to time constraints. She has also made cameo appearances: in some versions of Marvel Super Heroes where she can be summoned by Anita; in Capcom vs. SNK 2 as a restaurant patron in the Shanghai stage; in Street Fighter Alpha 2 as one of the party guests, along with her sister, in Ken's stage; and in Zombie Cafe in a guest appearance. Her guest appearances in collaboration events within assorted mobile games have included The Knights of Avalon and The Samurai Kingdom. Design Hsien- Ko (Lei-Lei) was chiefly created by Night Warriors: Darkstalkers' Revenge planners Haruo Murata and Noritaka Funamizu and graphically designed by Hitoshi Nishio, an artist responsible for the look of the new characters in the game. It was the first time Nishio has worked on a female character. In the beginning, Funamizu envisioned two human sisters who would have fought together, in a way similar to Morrigan Aensland's \\"Astral Vision\\" special move that makes Morrigan's double appear on other side of the screen and mirror her every move. That idea was abandoned due to the problems related to programming character control problems. Murata decided a lone Hsien-Ko would be too weak as a human being, and so he came up with the jiangshi idea \\"but Lei-Lei can't control her powers alone, so she fights with her sister transformed into an ofuda.\\" Nishio said: \\"after drawing Lei-Lei‚Äôs graphics I watched a real Chinese jiangshi movie, and I got a little worried about how Lei-Lei would be able to move around with that ofuda covering her eyes. (laughs) That was why I made Lin-Lin the ofuda.\\" Hsien-Ko's arsenal for her comedic \\"Anki Hou\\" special attack (throwing various projectiles including swords, daggers, axes, sledgehammers, kunai, shuriken, boomerangs, fuse bombs, chains, weights, bonsai trees, bronze statues, and Chun Li's bracelets) was created as team members would propose to add more items. According to another planner/designer, Junichi Ohno, Hsien-Ko was too strong at first and had to be balanced. Composer Takayuki Iwaim experimented with Hsien-Ko stage's background music in a way that he thought would match her character image while trying to \\"remove some of the 'dark' image the first game had.\\" Gameplay Hsien-Ko's fighting stance. Saturn Power said she \\"scared us all with her ... strange movement.\\" In the games, most of Hsien-Ko's powers \\"involve floating on air and pulling an impossibly huge collection of deadly items out of their sleeves.\\" According to Sega Saturn Magazine, unlike the other Darkstalkers characters, Hsien-Ko \\"is a mostly defensive character and hence spends most of the game blocking attacks and storing special gauges. She is excellent for countering moves and combos and a number of projectile attacks give her the edge in long range attacks.\\" She is one of the characters that can dash past an opponent and get behind them. Though Mei-Ling has never been a playable character in any of the games, a special move in Darkstalkers 3 involves her coming out to team up with Hsien-Ko. A cheat code in Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo, where Hsien-Ko and the other characters appear in a super-deformed state, allows access to Mei-Ling as a playable. According to GamesRadar, the Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds version of Hsien-Ko (an unlockable character capable of interacting with Chris Redfield) is \\"an extremely unorthodox character with a number of strange moves and weird mobility.\\" She was judged not good for beginners as her \\"weird normal attacks and bizarre movement options\\" and attacks are likely to confuse new players. The DLC Evil Twin Costume Pack includes Mei-Ling as an alternate skin for Hsien-Ko's model in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3. =Other appearances= Hsien-Ko and Mei-Ling make their first appearance in the second episode of the 1997 anime miniseries Night Warriors: Darkstalkers' Revenge. The twins travel Earth in an old T-bucket-style convertible with a trailer resembling a covered wagon attached. Their personalities, and speech patterns in the English dub of the program, differed considerably; Mei-Ling is the more sensible of the pair and speaks eloquently, whereas Hsien-Ko has a more childlike disposition, and her dialogue often contains modern colloquialisms or improper grammar (often saying \\"don't\\" in place of \\"doesn't\\"). She also appears in the 1995 American cartoon series that is loosely based on the games (in the episodes \\"Ghost Hunter\\" and \\"Darkest Before Dawn\\"), where Hsien-Ko's backstory was altered like those of several characters, in her case her transformation having resulted from her accidentally consuming a substance she mistook for rice that was hidden under a floorboard inside a hut. The character appears in other Darkstalkers media, such as the comic and manga adaptations of Night Warriors: Darkstalkers' Revenge by Run Ishida; and Itou Mami's Maleficarum, as well as in the 2004 card game Universal Fighting System by Jasco Games. Multiple Hsien-Ko figures and resin garage kits were released by various manufacturers, including FuRyu, among others. Capcom produced Hsien-Ko T-shirts and Banpresto released a series of mascot key chains. Reception and cultural impact Hsien-Ko was well received by Westen critics as one of the most remarkable characters in the series already filled with unusual characters, and have been noted as a popular fan favourite by many publications such as Complex, Eurogamer, Hardcore Gaming 101, and Siliconera, as well as by individuals such as Hi Score Girl author Rensuke Oshikiri. Japanese arcade gaming magazine Gamest named Lei-Lei as the seventh best character of 1995, as well as 32nd in 1997. Also in 1997, Japanese Sega Saturn Magazine ranked her as the 35th best female character on the Sega Saturn.Sega Saturn Magazine (Japan) 25/1997 (1997-07-25) p.129. Described as \\"scary but also sort of hilarious, a highly tactical fighter\\" by GamesRadar and as \\"one of the funniest characters around\\" by EGM2,EGM2 issue 50 (August 1998) page 129. Hsien-Ko was one of favorite female Asian video game characters of GameDaily's Robert Workman, who opined she \\"definitely has good looks, despite her oversized hands,\\"Workman, Robert (2009-02-06). Babe of the Week: Asian Beauties . GameDaily. Retrieved on 2009-02-09. while WhatCulture ranked her as the 28th greatest female fighting game character of all time. In 2013, Retro Gamer chose her one of the 19 \\"coolest fighters from the last 30 years\\", declaring that fellow Darkstalkers characters \\"Felicia, Demitri and B.B. Hood are equally well known, but Lei-Lei is a more unusual example of a popular character as she's so unorthodox and difficult to use effectively.\\"Retro Gamer issue 120 page 83. Japanese singer and voice actress Rina Kond≈ç used Lei-Lei as her nickname. The Skullgirls character Peacock's design was partially inspired by Hsien-Ko, and the game's first prototype around 1999 actually used her and Chun-Li sprites for testing.

It is located within the Myohyang Mountains. Founded under the Koryo dynasty at the start of the 11th century, the temple flourished as one of the greatest centers of Buddhism in the north of Korea, and became a renowned place of pilgrimage. Like most other temples in North Korea, the complex suffered extensive damage from US bombing during the Korean War. The temple is designated as National Treasure #40 in North Korea, with many of its component buildings and structures further declared as individual national treasures. History Pohyon Temple was founded under the Koryo dynasty in 1024 and named for the Buddhist deity Samantabhadra (known as Pohyon Posal in Korean). During the Imjin Wars, when Japanese warlord Toyotomi Hideyoshi ordered several attempted invasions of Korea, the temple became a stronghold for bands of warrior monks led by the great saint Sosan. At age 73, he led bands against the Japanese armies, even assisting recapture Pyongyang from the Japanese. He died at the temple in 1604. During the war, the temple was charged with protection the Chonju copy of the four Annals of the Yi Dynasty, which was secured in the nearby Puryong Hermitage. This copy was the only one to survive the war. In 1951, at the start of the Korean War, the complex was bombed by US forces, who destroyed over half of its 24 pre-war buildings, including the main prayer hall. Several have since been reconstructed. Composition The nine-story Tabo Pagoda Pohyon temple features extensive grounds. While most of the important buildings are located along an axis centered on Taeung Hall, much of the center of the temple is taken up by a large lawn surrounded by various other halls and shrines. Pohyon Temple was once entered through a series of three ceremonial gates, though visitors now enter through a gate at the temple's side. The outer gate, Jogye Gate (), was built in 1644 and houses to Deva statues; it is now closed to through traffic. Between this gate and Haetal Gate (, \\"Gate of Nirvana\\"), the temple's middle gate, is a long, tree-lined path lined with commemorative stele detailing the temple's history. Some of these still bear shrapnel scars from the Korean War. The inner gate of Pohyon Temple is Chonwang Gate , Gate of the Four Heavenly Kings\\"), which contains statues of the Buddhist deities of the same name. Directly through Chonwang Gate is Manse Pavilion (, \\"Pavilion of Ten Thousand Years\\"), a former meditation hall. Destroyed by American bombing in 1951, Manse Pavilion was reconstructed in 1979 out using concrete rather than its original wood. In front of the pavilion stands the nine-story Tabo Pagoda (, \\"Pagoda of Many Treasures\\"), erected in 1044 and designated National Treasure #7. The main hall of the temple, Taeung Hall () was also destroyed during the Korean War by U.S. bombing; reconstructed in 1976, it stands as faithful replica of the 1765 original. In the courtyard between it and Manse Pavilion stands the 13-storey Sokka Pagoda (), erected in the 14th century and designated National Treasure #144. To the right of Taeung Hall, and past a small garden, sits Kwanum Hall (). Named after the bodhisattva Avalokitesvara (known as Guanyin in Chinese), Kwanum Hall was built in 1449 and is the oldest building in the temple compound. It is designated as National Treasure #57. To the east of this hall is Ryongsan Hall () In the northeast corner of the temple is the walled Suchung Shrine (, \\"Shrine of Rewarding Loyalty\\"). Constructed in 1794, this small walled compound honors the priests who led bands of warrior monks to repel the Japanese invasions of 1592-1598. Inside, memorial services were once held for the great monk S≈èsan, who once resided in this temple and was instrumental in driving out the invasion forces of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. Inside the compound is a portrait hall, which contains paintings and relics related to three patriotic monks, and a Monument Pavilion, which houses a stele erected in 1796 to records S≈èsan's patriotic deeds. The compound is designated as National Treasure #143. South of the shrine, on the east side of the lawn, is the temple archive, also known as Changgyong Pavilion (). This is a modern structure, as the original library burned down during the US bombings of 1951. It houses a copy of the Tripitaka Koreana, a UNESCO-designated cultural relic; the original wooden printing blocks, however, are located at Haeinsa.

Chiusi came under the influence of Rome in the 3rd century BC and was involved in the Social War. In 540 AD it was occupied by the Ostrogoths and was later seat of a Lombard duchy. From the 11th century it was under the rule of the local bishop, and was later contended for by Orvieto and, from 1231, Siena, belonging to the latter until 1556, when it was annexed to the Grand duchy of Tuscany. Main sights The lowlands around Chiusi house numerous trove of tombs for this civilization. The Etruscan Museum of Chiusi is one of the most important repositories of Etruscan remains in Italy. Other sights include: *The Romanesque Cathedral (Duomo) of San Secondiano, built around 560 AD over a pre-existing basilica, and renovated in the 13th century. It has a nave and two aisles supported by antique columns. The Sacrament Chapel houses a Nativity and Saints by Bernardino Fugai. It has a separated bell tower which was turned into a defence tower in 1585. Under the tower is a Roman swim pool dating from the 1st century BC. *The so-called \\"Labyrinth of Porsenna\\", a series of tunnels under the town, built in the 6th-5th century BC and probably utilized in Etruscan-Roman times for drainage of rain waters. According to Pliny the Elder (Naturalis historia, XXXVI, XIX, 91-93), the Labyrinth was part of a monument including the sepulchre of the King Porsenna.

The film was released on direct-to-DVD in the United States on May 31, 2005.  Plot  Chris Cody (Steven Seagal) is a top-ranked mercenary who took part in an undercover operation to stop a major terrorist strike on U.S. soil; a strike that the UN refused to believe was about to happen. Cody had to break a number of laws in order to do the job, and he's in a military prison. At the U.S. Embassy in Montevideo, Uruguay, Secret Service agents are briefing the ambassador on a terrorist base when they suddenly go haywire and kill her, and then themselves. Later, in Washington DC, intelligence analyst Dr. Chappell (Christine Adams) concludes that some sort of mind control device must have been used. A Delta Force commando team is sent to Uruguay to investigate, but they are quickly ambushed and captured. Taken to the terrorist base, they are brainwashed by Dr. Adrian Lehder (Nick Brimble), a scientist who heads a secret CIA experiment in mind control, programming soldiers to become virtually unstoppable killing machines when they're given the right commands. The Navy recruits Cody and his talented crew to take Chappell and special agent Fletcher (William Hope) with them in an effort to destroy the facility and take down Lehder. Cody is promised that in exchange, he and his crew will be freed and cleared of the alleged misconduct that they were accused of and receive $100,000 each. Suspicious, Cody quickly jettisons Fletcher, who turns out to be in league with Lehder. Fletcher tips off Lehder, and they quickly abandon Lehder's facility, leaving behind a few American prisoners as Trojan horses. One team of Cody‚Äôs men commandeers a submarine, while the others secure the base and rescue the prisoners. The team fights its way past a tank, destroys the base, and escapes on the sub. But they end up stuck on the sub with some of the mind-controlled soldiers. After fighting off the soldiers and escaping from the sub, Cody and his crew realize that they must race to bring down Lehder before the rest of his soldiers claim them all.

It was completed in 1819, to make a transport link between Mansfield and the Cromford Canal at Pinxton. An important traffic was coal inward to Mansfield, as coal deposits near there were too deep to be extracted economically at the time; minerals, malt and other manufactures were exported from Mansfield. Collieries along the line of route were developed as time went on. From 1847 the Midland Railway developed a railway network in the locality of Mansfield, and purchased the M&PR;, converting it to be suitable for locomotive use and incorporating it in its own network. In the second half of the twentieth century, passenger and ordinary goods business in the Mansfield area declined substantially, leaving only a limited coal traffic via Codnor Park from 1970. The passenger service from Nottingham to Mansfield was revived under the marketing title The Robin Hood Line, opening to Mansfield in 1995, using the section of the original M&PR;, as modified by the Midland Railway, from Kirkby to Mansfield. The mineral traffic flow from Codnor Park continues. Conception The Mansfield and Pinxton RailwayThe canal age had resulted in a network that greatly reduced transport costs, but topography, in particular hilly terrain, left some localities deprived of the amenity. Mansfield had no canal; the nearest was the Pinxton basin of a branch of the Cromford canal, about 8 miles away. Mansfield‚Äôs industry was malting, and the manufacture of stockings and gloves, there were considerable limestone deposits, and sand particularly suited to moulding in cast iron manufacture. The lack of economical transport left Mansfield at a disadvantage in transporting its products to market. Pinxton was at the eastern edge of coal deposits at practicable depths at the time, so the coal consumed in Mansfield had to be brought in.Vanags, John, The Mansfield and Pinxton Railway, Old Mansfield Society, 2001, , pages 5 to 11 Business interests in Mansfield saw the desirability of a railway connection to the town and promoted a line from the Pinxton basin of the Cromford Canal to Mansfield. The Mansfield and Pinxton Railway was authorised by Act of 16 June 1817.Anderson, Paul and Cupit, Jack, An Illustrated History of Mansfield's Railways, Irwell Press, , page 10Grant, Donald, Directory of the Railway Companies of Great Britain, Matador Publishers, Kibworth Beauchamp, 2017, , page 361 Unlike many tramway extensions to canals, it was authorised independently. Its declared purpose was to convey heavy minerals, chiefly coal, lead and limestone at first, to and from the Pinxton basin of the Cromford canal. Pinxton was at the eastern edge of coal deposits at practicable depths at the time, so the coal was to be brought into Mansfield. The hilly terrain predisposed against extension of the canal. The authorised capital was ¬£22,800. Immediately after authorisation a meeting of the proprietors took place, indicating that businesspeople had already committed to funding the construction, and no general invitation to subscribe was required.Birks, John A, and Coxon, Peter, The Mansfield and Pinxton Railway, in Railway Magazine, July and August 1949, pages 224 to 231 Josias Jessop was the engineer of the project. Construction evidently proceeded rapidly, but there was a cost overrun. At a meeting held on 18 December 1818 it was said that an additional ¬£7,600 was needed to complete the railway.Vanags, page 16 Opening and early operation Pinxton Wharf. Tickets to travel on the railway could be bought at the Boat Inn The line was opened on 13 April 1819, when \\"the first load of coals was brought in to the Company's wharf [at Mansfield]... the coal was unloaded and taken to the market place where it was heaped up and set on fire.\\" This was evidently a major event in the locality: crowds met the incoming train at the five-arch bridge \\"where they met ten waggons laden with coal from the Pinxton colliery... the assemblage amounted to some thousands... Having arrived at the market-place about three o'clock, which, not withstanding the heavy rain falling at the time was thronged with people, the band struck up \\"God Save the King\\"... Nearly three hundred of the workmen who had been employed during the last three months on the road, then returned to partake of a dinner, provided for them by the proprietors, at different public houses in the town.\\"Nottingham Journal, 17 April 1819, quoted in Birks and Coxon The Mansfield terminal was Portland Wharf, alongside White Bear Lane. Bullocks were used as the motive power at first, and later horses were substituted. The railway was to be operated as a toll road: tonnage rates were set; owners of land adjacent to the line were to establish wharfs (goods sidings) and the company could step in if they failed to do so. Kings Mill Viaduct carried the Mansfield and Pinxton Railway across a small stream. The viaduct now carries a footpath.The line was double track, miles long. From Mansfield to the summit level there was a rise of 89 ft; it then fell 181 feetPriestley says the fall was 80 feet 10 inches, but from other figures he gives, this must be a misprint for 180 ft 10in. to the Pinxton terminal. The summit was a little under half way from Mansfield.Priestley, Joseph, Historical Account of the Navigable Rivers, Canals, and Railways of Great Britain, Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown and Green, London, 1833, pages 439 to 441 The track consisted of fish- bellied cast iron edge rails; the rails used a form of scarfed joints on stone block sleepers.Baxter, Bertram, Stone Blocks and Iron Rails, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1966, page 44 The selection of edge rails was not without controversy: plate rails (where the wagon wheels are plain and the plate provides the flange for containment) have the advantage that the wagons can leave the track and be manoeuvred on an ordinary flat surface. Losing that advantage was only justified if edge rails enabled heavier loads to be hauled by a horse; there seemed to be a lack of objective evidence on that point.Vanags, page 29 The track gauge was 4 ft in.Baxter, page 57 The Board of Trade Inspecting Officer visited on 25 September 1849, and his report mistakenly refers to a gauge of 4 ft 4 in.BoT Inspectors' reports often make approximations like this, possibly due to hastily scribbled note-taking on the day.Vanags, page 24 Financial trends At the first proprietors' meeting in April 1820 it was announced that the cost of building the railway had been ¬£35,000, \\"which had put the Company and its investors into debt\\".Vanags, page 26 The amount collected by tolls was ¬£1,350, and a dividend of 3% was declared. Income figures are available for the year 1833-4: gross income was ¬£1,966 3s 9d; expenses were ¬£485 13s 2d and a dividend of 9% was paid. Coal and coke were by far the dominant commodity carried.By independent carriers, of course. Repairing the rails proved more expensive than had been foreseen: the cost of repairs in the 1824/25 statement amounted to ¬£204 18s. In 1834, it was decided that if any new rails were required they should be of wrought iron, not less than 12 feet long. Larger stone blocks were needed for the sleepers for these rails. They were to measure not less than 2 feet by 20 inches and 8 inches thick. The first order for the longer rails was for 200 yards. In 1836 one hundred and sixty rails were ordered.Vanags, page 27 Although the Mansfield & Pinxton Railway was originally envisaged as an extension of the Cromford Canal, the canal company took little interest in the railway, and repeatedly declined to give discounted rates. Most of the traffic in later years was coal from pits alongside the lower part of the line to the industrial and domestic hearths of Mansfield. The quantity of stone conveyed was less than expected, mainly because of the expense of carrying it forward by canal. Nevertheless, one of Britain's most famous landmarks, the Palace of Westminster (the Houses of Parliament) was rebuilt during the mid-1830s using limestone transported over the Pinxton line. Mansfield dispatched its renowned moulding sand to local ironworks via the railway and received wagons of metal for its foundries. Bricks, lime, timber, slate and assorted agricultural produce made up the remaining traffic. Nevertheless coal outweighed the traffic volumes seven to one.Anderson, page 11 Passenger operation William Epperstone provided a passenger service from 1832; his vehicle left \\"Wheatcroft & Co's.

These two organisations were so confident about their prospects that they jointly purchased the Mansfield & Pinxton company the following year. The Midland Railway had decided to build a line from Nottingham to Mansfield, using part of the Pinxton Railway, and Parliament favoured their plans, and an Act for the Nottingham Mansfield railway (initially connecting with the Mansfield & Pinxton north of Kirkby in Ashfield) was passed on 16 July 1846.Clement E Stretton, The History of the Midland Railway, Methuen & Co, London, 1901, page 124 The Midland Railway got its Mansfield and Erewash Valley Extension Act on 9 July 1847. This sanctioned the acquisition of the tramway and its incorporation in a line between Codnor Park and Mansfield. Ownership of the Pinxton line remained a problem. The issue was finally resolved on 15 February 1848, when the Railway Commissioners issued a certificate, by the authority of which the Mansfield & Pinxton Railway was amalgamated with the Midland and immediately dissolved.Stretton, pages 127 and 128 The purchase of the Mansfield and Pinxton Tramway cost ¬£21,066 13s. 4d.; Stretton considered that a comparatively small sum.Stretton, page 126 Conversion and reopening This gave the Midland Railway two routes to Mansfield: a new line from near Nottingham, via the Leen Valley, and the Erewash Valley line via Codnor Park. The tramway style of track of the Mansfield and Pinxton Railway needed to be completely renewed. It had been built with no concern for speed, and several sharp curves needed to be eased. The work progressed rapidly, and on 24 August 1849 a contractor's locomotive visited Mansfield, attracting considerable local attention. Midland Railway directors arrived by special train on 17 September, and the Board of Trade inspection took place on 25 September. The route between Kirkby and Mansfield section was found to be in good shape. but the Codnor Park line was missing several crossing gates and even some short lengths of track. Mineral workings over the Codnor Park line (not requiring Board of Trade approval), and passenger services from Mansfield to Nottingham, commenced on 9 October 1849. There were four passenger journeys a day, taking 55 minutes. Mansfield trains from Nottingham followed the River Leen through Radford and Hucknall. Then there was an arduous four mile climb at 1 in 79 past Linby and Newstead to Kirkby Tunnel, 199 yards. The line continued to Kirkby, and a short distance north of there, the new line joined the route of the Pinxton railway past Sutton-in-Ashfield and across King's Mill viaduct to Mansfield. The distance from Nottingham to Mansfield was about 17 miles. There was a new terminal at Mansfield, attached to the original Mansfield and Pinxton warehouse. The Codnor Park-Mansfield railway climbed gently up the Erewash Valley to join the old tramway formation east of Pinxton basin.Anderson, pages 18 and 20 Extended colliery working The Mansfield line became the springboard for reaching areas north and east of the town, promoted by the expansion of coal working in those areas. Mansfield station was converted for through working in 1872, although actual through operation did not begin until 1875.Anderson, page 25 Numerous other collieries directly on the former Mansfield and Pinxton line opened towards the end of the nineteenth century, as technological improvements enabled the exploitation of the deeper seams. Many branch lines connections to the M&PR; route were made, and competing lines were opened too. The twentieth century Expansion of colliery activity continued in the twentieth century. The Midland Railway became a constituent of the new London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1923, under the \\"grouping\\" of the railways, directed by the Railways Act 1921. In turn the LMS, with other companies, was nationalised in 1948, becoming part of British Railways. By this time local passenger traffic (and the ordinary goods business) had been hard hit by road competition. Ordinary passenger services from Mansfield to Codnor Park and Pye Bridge had been withdrawn on 10 September 1951, although a workmen's service from Kirkby to Nottingham continued until 6 September 1965. On 12 October 1964 the Leen Valley passenger trains between Nottingham and Mansfield were withdrawn.Anderson, page 73 On June 1975 all goods facilities at Mansfield were withdrawn, so that the local rail network was entirely dependent on coal traffic. The Midland Railway Leen Valley route had already been severed between Kirkby in Ashfield and Annesley on 11 October 1970.Anderson, pages 75 and 76 Passenger trains reinstated A body of opinion developed in favour of funding reinstatement of the Leen Valley services to Mansfield, and an authorising Act for the Newstead - Kirkby link was passed on 26 July 1990; the term 'Robin Hood Line' was adopted. A Nottingham - Newstead passenger service began on 17 May 1993. In 1994 work started on reinstating the link at Kirkby tunnel, and passenger services from Nottingham to Mansfield Woodhouse started operation on 20 November 1995; the service was later extended to Worksop. The trains ran over the alignment of the Mansfield and Pinxton Railway as modified by the Midland Railway, between Kirkby and Mansfield. The line from Codnor Park is in use for mineral traffic, and uses the M&PR; route from Pinxton.

According to the UKB website, its members are mostly descendants of \\"Old Settlers\\" or \\"Western Cherokee,\\" those Cherokee who migrated from the Southeast to present-day Arkansas and Oklahoma about 1817. Some reports estimate that Old Settlers began migrating west by 1800. This was before the forced relocation of Cherokee by the United States in the late 1830s under the Indian Removal Act. Although politically the UKB is not associated with the Trail of Tears, many of the members have direct ancestors who completed the journey in 1838/1839. Many UKB members are traditionalists and Baptists. Government UKB Tribal Complex, West Willis Road, Tahlequah Today the UKB has over 14,300 members, with 13,300 living within the state of Oklahoma. Joe Bunch is the current Chief. Assistant Chief is Jamie Thompson. Joyce Fourkiller-Hawk serves as the tribal Secretary and Ella Mae Worley is the tribe's Treasurer. Tribal officers hold four-year terms while tribal council members are elected to two-year terms. The election calendars parallel the United States' national election calendar (Mid-terms and Presidential). Economic development The tribe owns and operates Keetoowah Construction in Tahlequah, and the Keetoowah Cherokee Treatment Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma. They have an arts and crafts gallery, showcasing members' work. They own and operate the Keetoowah Cherokee Casino, with over 500 gaming machines, in Tahlequah.Keetoowah Cherokee Casino. 500 Nations.

(retrieved 2 Nov 2009)  Origins  The word Keetoowah (Kituwa) is the name of an ancient Cherokee mother town and earthwork mound in the eastern homeland of the Cherokee. Kituwah also is considered by the Cherokee to be their original name.Clough, Josh. United Keetoowah Band. Oklahoma History Center's Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. (retrieved 2 Nov 2009) The UKB's original land claims include all or parts of Alabama, the Carolinas, Georgia, Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia. Following the western movement of the Cherokee, UKB traditional territories include the above- mentioned states with the addition of Arkansas, Illinois, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Texas.  History  The UKB members are composed primarily of descendants of the \\"Old Settlers,\\" Cherokee who settled in present-day Arkansas and Oklahoma around 1817.http://www.keetoowahcherokee.org/about- ukb/history They were well established before most of the Cherokee were forcibly relocated by the United States government from the Southeast to Indian Territory in what became known as the 1838 Trail of Tears. By the 1880s, all Cherokee people faced increased pressure by the US government for assimilation. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Cherokee and other Native American children were sent to Indian boarding schools away from home for their education: they were expected to speak only English, were generally prohibited from speaking their own languages, and were expected to adopt Christianity rather than practice native spirituality. The US federal government unilaterally closed and seized Cherokee and other Native American governmental and public institutions through the 1898 Curtis Act, the Dawes Act and the 1906 Five Civilized Tribes Act. Under this legislation, they broke up communal tribal holdings and allotted plots of land to individual households, intended to be developed according to the European-American model of subsistence farming.Bruce, Louis R. \\"Powers, Rights and Limitations of the UKB under Federal Law.\\" Gaduwa Cherokee News. July 2011: 2. Retrieved 21 Dec 2011. The Dawes Commission was tasked to extinguish Native American land claims and break up tribal governments by allotting what was considered communal tribal lands. By assigning plots to individual households among the Five Civilized Tribes, they intended to encourage the European-American model of subsistence farming. Afterward the US government appointed certain Cherokee chiefs to administer tribal lands and holdings, rather than allowing the people to continue with their practice of hereditary chiefs.  History of Federal recognition  Virginia Stroud, enrolled UKB member, accepts an award for her artwork, Cherokee Heritage Center, Park Hill, Oklahoma, 2007 Under the Curtis Act of 1898, the government of the Cherokee Nation was dissolved in 1906, in spite of the resistance of many of its members. The only remnant left was the office of the Principal Chief, held by William Charles Rogers. He had been deposed in 1905 by the National Council for cooperating in the tribe's dissolution. He was replaced with Frank J. Boudinot (who was also the leader of the Keetoowah Nighthawk Society). The next year, the US government re- appointed Rogers and directed him to manage land sales. He held office until 1914. After that the US government did not appoint a chief and the position was dormant. Chronicles of Oklahoma Volume 15, No. 3 Prior to World War II, the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt worked to strengthen Native American tribes by encouraging them to reconstitute their governments and adopt an electoral process. Congress passed the Indian Reorganization Act (1934). The state legislature passed the Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act (OIWA, 1936); both were considered part of the Indian New Deal to support tribes' reorganizing their governments. The Cherokee began to organize on their own terms. In the meantime, the President of the United States officially appointed Principal Chiefs for the Cherokee; these appointments were made through the Department of Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs. The UKB ratified their constitution and by-laws on October 3, 1950.\\"Constitution and By-Laws of the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians.\\" Native American Constitution and Law Digitization Project. Retrieved 5 Dec 2013. The tribe was federally recognized in 1950 under the Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act. Early elected leaders of the UKB were Levi Gritts, followed by John Hitcher, and the Reverend Jim Pickup, who served in the post-World War II era.Meredith 97-8 Cherokee language The UKB have struggled to maintain use and education in the Cherokee language. As of 2018, only 101 people in the UKB were counted as being fluent, with most speakers either in the grandparent generation or older. In 2019, the Tri-Council of Cherokee tribes declared a state of emergency for the language due to the threat of it going extinct, and called for the enhancement of revitalization programs. Conflict with the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma After the federal dissolution of the Old Cherokee Nation under the Dawes Commission and allotments, Native American land claims in Indian Territory were extinguished and Oklahoma was admitted as a state. Indians listed on the Dawes Commission rolls and other rolls were effectively left without political representation. In the late 1940s, the United Keetoowah Band's claim to recognition as a tribe was probed according to criteria influenced by John Collier, who led the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and Felix S. Cohen. Writer D'Arcy McNickle argued that the Cherokee Nation no longer existed in any form except to sign over Indian lands. He suggested that the UKB be granted federal acknowledgment based on its authenticity and connection to the traditional ways, including maintenance of the language and ceremonies. After 1947, the UKB was the federally recognized organization by which all the Cherokee people received federal assistance and were dealt with on federal programs. The UKB was able to secure federal funds for the Cherokee Nation Complex, which today houses the government of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma (CNO), also federally recognized in the late 20th century. The UKB also started the Cherokee National Holiday, in conjunction with the Principal Chief's office. The Cherokee Nation Housing Authority was begun using UKB's federally recognized status.Georgia Ray Leeds, The United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians, Peter Lang Publishing, Inc., 1996 Even the casino enterprises, which have for decades given the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma a motive to try to destroy or \\"de-recognize\\" the UKB and its membership, emerged from precedent set by the cooperation of the UKB. The Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma received approval of their constitution and federal recognition in 1975. The two nations pursued independent paths; the CNO had many more members and asserted political power in the region. The CNO evicted the UKB from the offices at the tribal complex in Tahlequah, which had originally been acquired through the United Keetoowah Band's government-to-government relationship with the United States.Leeds (1996), The United Keetoowah Band, p. 70 The CNO administrations of Wilma Mankiller and Chad \\"Corntassel\\" Smith have had many conflicts with UKB leadership. Smith was a member of the UKB, but due to these issues, the tribe revoked his membership in 2005. UKB membership The United Keetoowah Band maintains a one-quarter-blood requirement for members. It requires all members to have verifiable Cherokee descent either from a person or people on the Dawes Roll or the UKB Base Roll of 1949.\\"Enrollment\\", United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians in Oklahoma website, Retrieved 21 Dec 2011. Beginning in the 1970s, the UKB made some people honorary, adopted and associate members, to recognize their services to the nation. This continued an older practice of Keetoowah adoption or naturalization of captives and friends dating to the 19th century. Former President Bill Clinton is a notable associate member. Given the problems in the 21st century of persons trying to gain benefits by claiming distant Cherokee or UKB ancestry, the tribe no longer practices honorary membership. Ward Churchill, a former Professor of Ethnic Studies at the University of Colorado, had long claimed to be of Cherokee descent and made his reputation on promoting Native American issues and an activist Native American view. He was revealed to have no such ancestry. Then he claimed to be an honorary associate member in the UKB, but the tribe has rejected this claim as fraudulent.  Legal issues  UKB Jim Proctor Elder Community Center, Tahlequah =Gaming casinos= In the late 20th century, several tribes began to develop gaming facilities on their own sovereign or trust lands, and in consultation with affected states. Such enterprises have raised revenues often used for development and welfare. The State of Oklahoma has sued the UKB in federal court for operating what it describes as illegal gaming facilities, as they are not on Bureau of Indian Affairs-approved tribal trust lands. According to briefs submitted by the Cherokee Nation, the UKB own no tribal lands in federal trust. The lawsuit is pending in the federal courts in Oklahoma. It has been remanded to the National Indian Gaming Commission for review.Official Site of the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians - Federally Recognized During the State of Oklahoma lawsuit pertaining to the UKB's alleged illegal casino operations for a casino that the tribe has been operating for approximately 19 years, the UKB was accused of attempting to sue the Cherokee Nation. The Cherokee Nation said the UKB had sued to demand cession of tribal land allotments to them in order to build casinos. These lawsuits were dismissed.{{citation neededdate=May 2020 =Land claims= The UKB has sued the United States for a share of the proceeds under HR-3534, a bill that required the United States to compensate the Cherokee Nation and two other Oklahoma tribes for claims to the disclaimed drybed lands of the Arkansas River. The legislation set aside ten percent of each tribe's share of the settlement for other claimant tribes; it afforded other claimant tribes an opportunity to file claims within 180 days of the legislation. The UKB filed suit against the United States in the Court of Claims. The Cherokee Nation moved to intervene and to dismiss the UKB suit. It contended that the Cherokee Nation is an indispensable party and that it cannot be joined in the litigation because of its sovereign immunity. The Court of Claims granted both of the Cherokee Nation's motions. On April 14, 2006, on appeal, the United States sided with the UKB against the Cherokee Nation's request for dismissal. The Court of Federal Claims heard the appeal on November 8, 2006., May 2006 In June 2004, the UKB requested that the BIA take into trust land which the tribe owned on a fee basis, a Community Services Parcel. The case has been studied and the request was originally denied, but the UKB appealed. In May 2011, the BIA finally announced its decision to take into trust for the UKB of land in Tahlequah. This land includes several of its community centers and the sacred dance ground.

Geography Ashoknagar is situated at the average elevation of 507 metres(1640 ft) above sea level. It is in the plateau region and has an agricultural topography. The plateau is an extension of the Deccan Traps, formed between 60 and 68 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous period. In this region, the main classes of soil are black, brown and bhatori (stony) soil. The volcanic, clay- like soil of the region owes its black colour to the high iron content of the basalt from which it is formed. The soil requires less irrigation because of its high capacity for moisture retention. The other two soil types are lighter and have a higher proportion of sand. The year is popularly divided into three seasons: summer, the rains, and winter. Summer extends over the months of Chaitra to Jyestha (mid-March to mid-May). The average daily temperature during the summer months is 35 ¬∞C, which typically rises to around 46 ¬∞C on a few days. The rainy season starts with the first showers of Aashaadha (mid- June) and extends to the middle of Ashvin (September). Most of the rain falls during the southwest monsoon spell, and ranges from about 100 cm in the west to about 165 cm in the east. Ashoknagar and surrounding areas receive an average of 140 cm of rainfall a year. The growing period lasts from 90 to 150 days, during which the average daily temperature is below 30 ¬∞C, but seldom falls below 20 ¬∞C. Winter is the longest of the three seasons, extending for about five months (mid-Ashvin to Phalgun, i.e., October to mid-March). The average daily temperature ranges from 15 ¬∞C to 20 ¬∞C, though on some nights it can fall as low as 5 ¬∞C. Some cultivators believe that an occasional winter shower during the months of Pausha and Maagha‚Äîknown as Mawta‚Äîis helpful to the early summer wheat and germ crops.[5] =Climate= The climate of Ashoknagar is sub-tropical. In summers, the temperature reaches 47 ¬∞C, while dropping to 4 ¬∞C in the winter. Rainfall is adequate and sometimes less.

It was founded in 1912 and is based in The Hague in the Netherlands. Mission statement  The International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) is the global federation of national associations of pharmacists and pharmaceutical scientists. It gathers 137 member organisations and represents three million practitioners and scientists around the world. It is a nongovernmental organisation (NGO) in official relations with the World Health Organization. The mission of FIP is to \\"improve global health by advancing pharmacy practice and science to enable better discovery, development, access to and safe use of appropriate, cost-effective, quality medicines worldwide.\\"FIP. 2020 Vision - FIP's vision, mission and strategic plan. The Hague: FIP. 2008 History The Federation was founded on 25 September 1912 in The Hague, the Netherlands. It was the outcome of the series of international pharmaceutical congresses held in the nineteenth century, more specifically the congress held in Brussels in 1885. Following an initiative of the Royal Dutch Pharmaceutical Society in 1909, the 10th international pharmaceutical congress in 1910 in Brussels resolved to establish an international pharmaceutical federation in The Hague. The first president was Prof. Dr, L√©opold of Itallie, professor at Leiden University. The first secretary-general was Dr. J.J. Hofman, pharmacist in The Hague. Governance FIP consists of two boards: the Board of Pharmaceutical Practice and the Board of Pharmaceutical Sciences. = Board of Pharmaceutical Practice = The FIP Board of Pharmaceutical Practice, which embodies pharmacists, has eight sections, each focusing on specific areas of pharmacy, developing and enhancing professional practice through shared experience. The Sections represent the following areas of pharmacy practice: * Academic Pharmacy * Clinical Biology * Community Pharmacy * Health and Medicines Information * Hospital Pharmacy * Industrial Pharmacy * Military and Emergency Pharmacy * Social and Administrative Pharmacy = Board of Pharmaceutical Sciences = The Board of Pharmaceutical Sciences (BPS) is in place within FIP to provide a forum for pharmaceutical scientists to communicate, network, and further develop their expertise and knowledge in their areas of interest. This is accomplished through member participation in special interest groups that focus on specific aspects of pharmaceutical science and research. Targeted specifically to this group is the Pharmaceutical Sciences World Congress, which is held every 4 years in a different location around the world. The most recent was in Melbourne, Australia in 2014. Special interest groups have been formed on the following areas: * Bioavailability and Bioequivalence * Biopharmaceutics Classification System * Dissolution * Environment and pharmaceuticals * Individualized Medicine * Medicinal Chemistry * Natural Products * Nuclear Pharmacy * Pharmaceutical Biotechnology * Pharmacoepidemiology and pharmacoeconomics Role of Board of Pharmaceutical Sciences The role of this Board is to handle all scientific aspects of FIP's activities. To fulfill this task, the BPS has developed a strategic plan with a clear mission, namely to establish and maintain itself as the leading forum for representation of pharmaceutical science throughout the world. The main approaches to accomplish this mission are: * Coordinating the advancement for the pharmaceutical sciences worldwide by providing a global network for national and Supranational organizations representing pharmaceutical sciences; * Providing an international platform for interactions amongst pharmaceutical scientists; * Contribution to public policy issues related to pharmaceutical research - e.g. gene products, biologicals, drugs: their discovery, development, production, regulation and rational use; * Fostering the career development of pharmaceutical scientists; * Identifying and nurturing emerging areas of science in the pharmaceutical sciences; * Enhancing recognition of the achievements of pharmaceutical scientists; * Interacting with organizations of health care providers to strengthen their scientific base; * Encourage high quality in pharmaceutical sciences; * Assisting in advancing the pharmaceutical sciences in developing countries; * Sponsoring international symposia, conferences and training programs for pharmaceutical scientists; * Liaising with governmental authorities to establish and to increase financial support or research and development in pharmaceutical sciences.  The FIP Foundation for Education and Research  The Foundation's objectives are to promote the education of, and research by pharmacists and pharmaceutical scientists within the general fields of design, manufacture, distribution and use of medicines for humans and/or animals. In order to achieve its objectives, the Foundation may undertake any of the following activities: Making awards in recognition of excellence; Making grants to support education or research; Granting Fellowships to permit a period of research at an approved institution; Awarding Scholarships to permit short periods of international travel in order to study the practice of pharmacy or pharmaceutical science in another country or in other countries; All other charitable activities which do not conflict with the aforementioned objectives or the general objectives of the International Pharmaceutical Federation/F√©d√©ration Internationale Pharmaceutique (FIP). The FIP Foundation for Education and Research was set up in 1993 with a programme of grants and awards. In addition to the Awards in Recognition of Excellence, the FIP Foundation also makes available FIP Development Grants to young pharmacists in training or research, FIP International Travel Scholarships and FIP Fellowships. In 1997 it introduced the Young Poster Presenter's Awards, which are given to a number of people who have submitted abstracts for the FIP Congress, which have been screened and approved by either the scientific or professional secretary. Donations and other forms of sponsorship are an essential ingredient to the success of the Awards programme and to the FIP Foundation and has set up a FIP Foundation Supporter's Club. It has developed a series of benefit, both individual and corporate, which will attract potential donors/sponsors. There are six categories - Ribbon, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum and Diamond.

After studying at the Royal College of Music (RCM) in London, and army service in the First World War, he was a schoolmaster and college lecturer. In 1938 he became director of the RCM, the first of its alumni to do so. As director he instituted financial and organisational reforms and steered the college through the difficult days of the Second World War. As a composer Dyson wrote in a traditional idiom, reflecting the influence of his teachers at the RCM, Hubert Parry and Charles Villiers Stanford. His works were well known during his lifetime but underwent a period of neglect before being revived in the late 20th century. Life and career=Early years= Dyson was born in Halifax, Yorkshire, the eldest of the three children of John William Dyson, a blacksmith, and his wife, Alice, n√©e Greenwood, a weaver.Foreman, Lewis. \\"Dyson, Sir George (1883‚Äì1964)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004. Retrieved 20 November 2017 Dyson senior was also organist and choirmaster at a local church, and both parents were members of amateur choirs. They encouraged their son's musical talent, and at the age of 13 he was appointed as a church organist. Three years later he secured an FRCO (Fellowship of the Royal College of Organists), and in 1900 he won an open scholarship to the Royal College of Music (RCM) where he studied composition with Sir Charles Villiers Stanford. He supported himself during his years studying at the RCM by working as assistant organist at St Alfege Church, Greenwich.Spicer, p. 15 He won the Arthur Sullivan prize for compositionSpicer, p. 35 while still an RCM student, and in 1904 was awarded a Mendelssohn Scholarship, \\"Dyson, Sir George\\", Who Was Who, online edition, Oxford University Press, 2014. Retrieved 20 November 2017 which enabled him to spend three years in Italy, Austria and Germany. He met leading musicians including Richard Strauss, whose style is believed to have influenced Dyson's early compositions. His symphonic poem Siena (1907) was considered by The Times to stand out from many works by other young composers,\\"Music\\", The Times, 21 May 1909, p. 1 but the score has not survived.Foreman, Lewis. \\"Dyson, Sir George\\", Grove Music Online, Oxford University Press. Retrieved 20 November 2017. When he returned to Britain in 1907 Dyson was appointed director of music at the Royal Naval College, Osborne, on the recommendation of Sir Hubert Parry, director of the RCM. From there he moved to Marlborough College in 1911. Dyson's first publication: notes on grenade warfare, 1915 On the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 Dyson joined the Royal Fusiliers, becoming grenadier officer of the 99th infantry brigade. In that role he wrote a training pamphlet on grenade warfare for which he became well known. In 1916, incapacitated by shell-shock, he was invalided back to England. Parry recorded in his diary how shaken he was when he saw Dyson, \\"a shadow of his former self\\".Foreman, Lewis. Notes to Naxos CD 8.557720 (2004) In November 1917 Dyson married Mildred Lucy Atkey (1880‚Äì1975), daughter of a London solicitor. They had a son, Freeman, who became a noted theoretical physicist and mathematician, and a daughter, Alice. In 1917 Dyson received the degree of DMus from the University of Oxford. After a long convalescence Dyson was commissioned as a major in the newly formed Royal Air Force (RAF), serving until 1920. In this capacity, organising RAF bands, he completed the short score of Henry Walford Davies's RAF March Past, adding a slow middle section and fully scoring the whole piece. =Schoolmaster and professor= In 1920 Dyson's composing career advanced when his Three Rhapsodies for string quartet were chosen for publication under the Carnegie Trust's publication scheme. In 1921 he took up the posts of music master at Wellington College and professor of composition at the RCM. In 1924, while remaining at the RCM he switched schools, moving to Winchester. His biographer Lewis Foreman comments that it was during his dual tenure at the RCM and Winchester that \\"the various strands of his mature career as a composer developed\\". In addition to teaching at the RCM and Winchester and directing the school's music, Dyson was conductor of an adult choral society, and a visiting lecturer at Liverpool and Glasgow universities; composing had to be fitted into what spare time he had. Works from this period include the cantata In Honour of the City (1928), described by The Musical Times as \\"a virile fantasia for chorus and orchestra [which] illustrates memorably the composer's talent for diatonic melody of impressive eloquence, his predilection for enharmonic modulation contrived with apposite ingenuity, and his accomplished handling of orchestral subtleties.\\"Hull, Robert H. \\"George Dyson\\", The Musical Times, September 1933, pp. 800‚Äì801 Foreman writes that the cantata was so successful that Dyson soon produced a more ambitious piece, The Canterbury Pilgrims (1931) \\"a succession of evocative and colourful Chaucerian portraits ‚Ä¶ and probably his most famous score\\". British choral festivals commissioned new works from Dyson. For the Three Choirs Festival he composed St Paul's Voyage to Melita (1933) and Nebuchadnezzar (1935) and for Leeds, The Blacksmiths (1934). Purely orchestral works included a Symphony in G (1937), which The Times praised for originality, underivative nature and avoidance of \\"the freakishly obscure or the pompously grandiose\\".\\"Queen's Hall: Dr Dyson's New Symphony\\", The Times, 17 December 1937, p. 14 From the early 1930s Dyson and others had been concerned about the future of amateur music making in Britain, which was under increasing pressure from the Great Depression and what Dyson called \\"the invasions of mechanical music\\" ‚Äì the gramophone and the radio.Dyson, George. \\"Towards National Co-operation: An Outline and a Policy\\", The Musical Times, February 1936, pp. 121‚Äì125 With the aid of the Carnegie Trust Dyson co-founded the National Federation of Music Societies in 1935 as an umbrella organisation and financial bulwark for music groups and performing societies. =RCM director and later years= Royal College of Music, London In 1938 Dyson was appointed director of the RCM on the retirement of Sir Hugh Allen; he took great pride in being the first former student of the RCM to become its director. He secured funding for the college from the University Grants Committee, and set up a pension scheme for the staff. He instituted an overhaul of the college's facilities, from rehearsal space down to lavatories, to provide a better working environment for the students.Spicer, p. 238 He also modernised the curriculum and examination system of the college.Spicer, p. 240 He held the strong view that with first-rate performances of music now easily and regularly available on radio and record, people now coming into the musical profession needed to attain the highest standards if they were to compete.Spicer, p. 242 His emphasis on technical excellence led to criticism; The Times said that he \\"reversed the humanistic trend that had been the ideal of the college\\".\\"Obituary: Sir George Dyson\\", The Times, 30 September 1964, p. 17 When the Second World War began in 1939 many educational and other organisations were evacuated from London to avoid the expected bombing. Dyson was adamant that the RCM should remain in its home in South Kensington.Spicer, p. 245 His decision had important consequences beyond the college, as other institutions followed suit, with the result that continuity of training was possible and standards were maintained. At the RCM, Malcolm Sargent took charge of the college orchestra, and Karl Geiringer, displaced by the Nazis from the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde in Vienna, joined the faculty.Spicer, p. 247 After the war, Dyson had to deal with a surge in demand for places at the college: students who had interrupted their studies to join the armed forces and the post-war generation of new applicants swelled the numbers of applicants, and Dyson and his board were obliged to make the requirements for entry more stringent.Spicer, p. 272 His emphasis on practical musicianship led him to cull the college's library and archives, disposing of many old books and manuscripts, to the outrage of some colleagues.Spicer, pp. 276‚Äì277 Dyson's encouragement of talent sometimes showed itself in a willingness to depart from normal practice when he felt it necessary. Although Colin Davis, as a clarinet student, was not allowed to take part in the conducting class because his pianistic skills were judged inadequate,Blyth, p. 8 Malcolm Arnold fared better: even though he decamped from the college, Dyson encouraged him to return and smoothed his path in doing so;Spicer, p. 232 for Julian Bream Dyson made special arrangements to enable him to pursue his guitar studies, not hitherto part of the college's curriculum.Spicer, pp. 295‚Äì296 Dyson received a knighthood in 1941 and was appointed Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO) in 1953. He held honorary degrees from the universities of Aberdeen and Leeds and honorary fellowships of the Royal Academy of Music and Imperial College London. In 1952 Dyson retired from the RCM. He moved to Winchester, and enjoyed what Foreman describes as \\"a remarkable Indian summer\\" of composition, although by this time his music seemed old-fashioned to some listeners. His late works were published and performed, but did not, according to Foreman, \\"have quite the immediate following\\" of the music from earlier in his career. Dyson died at his home in Winchester on 28 September 1964, aged 81.Spicer, p. 394 Music Dyson said of himself as a composer, \\"My reputation is that of a good technician ‚Ä¶ not markedly original. I am familiar with modern idioms but they are outside the vocabulary of what I want to say\\". The music critic of The Times remarked that Dyson's works had a certain ambiguity, \\"due probably to the fact that great musical skill was allied, exceptionally, with an extrovert temperament.\\" The same writer observed that although everything Dyson wrote was well made, he never developed a personal idiom, \\"nor engendered much emotional sap in his larger works\\". Dyson's biographer Paul Spicer writes that of the composer's works only The Canterbury Pilgrims and two sets of evening canticles in D and F are performed with any frequency.Spicer, p. 1 Dyson himself chose to include the following works in his Who's Who entry: In Honour of the City, 1928; The Canterbury Pilgrims, 1931; St Paul's Voyage, 1933; The Blacksmiths, 1934; Nebuchadnezzar, 1935; Symphony, 1937; Quo Vadis, 1939; Violin Concerto, 1942; Concerto da Camera and Concerto da Chiesa for Strings, 1949; Concerto Leggiero for Piano and Strings, 1951; Sweet Thames Run Softly, 1954; Agincourt, 1955; Hierusalem, 1956; Let's go a-Maying, 1958; and A Christmas Garland, 1959. In addition to those mentioned by the composer, the Dyson Trust lists the following compositions as available as at 2017: A Spring Garland, Children's Suite for orchestra, Evening Service in C Minor, Evening Service in D, Morning Service in D, Prelude, Fantasy and Chaconne for cello and orchestra, Te Deum Laudamus, and Three Rhapsodies for string quartet.\\"Works\\", Sir George Dyson Trust.

The book focuses on Harris' disenchantment with the contemporary secular dating scene, and offers ideas for improvement, alternative dating/courting practices, and a view that singleness need not be a burden nor characterized by what Harris describes as \\"selfishness\\". By the late 2010s, Harris reconsidered his view that dating should be avoided, apologizing to those whose lives were negatively impacted by the book and directing the book's publisher to discontinue its publication.  Overview  In I Kissed Dating Goodbye, Harris popularized the concept of \\"courting\\" as an alternative to mainstream dating. In so doing, he raised discussion regarding the appropriateness of his proposed solutions as well as the foundations on which he based his reasoning. According to Harris, people in dating relationships put up a fa√ßade in an attempt to appear to be what the other person wants, thus hampering the \\"getting to know you\\" part of dating. Harris said that it is more appropriate and healthier in the long run to participate in \\"group dates\\" in order to truly understand the way a particular person interacts with others; in a group setting, a person is less likely to be able to maintain a fa√ßade. Harris proposed a system of courtship that involved the parents of both parties to a greater degree than is usual in conventional dating. In an interview with Family Christian Stores, Harris indicated that \\"people have taken the message of I Kissed Dating Goodbye and made it something legalistic ‚Äì a set of rules. That's something that's beyond my control and it's disappointing at times...\\" On November 20, 2005, Harris gave a sermon entitled \\"Courtship, Schmourtship: What Really Matters in Relationships\\". In it, Harris encouraged single adults in his church to form friendships.  Critique  The book has been cited as an example of belief in 'benevolent sexism' and 'women as property'Moon, Sarah, and Jo Reger. \\"'You Are Not Your Own': Rape, Sexual Assault and Consent in Evangelical Christian Dating Books.\\" Journal of Integrated Social Sciences 4, no. 1 (2014): 55-74. as well as promoting 'rape supportive messaging'Klement, Kathryn R., and Brad J.

Boundaries in Dating: Making Dating Work. Zondervan, 2000. 12-21  Retraction and apology by author  In 2016, Harris appeared to be reconsidering the claims that he had made in the book and apologized to several who publicly communicated how the book had influenced them to stay single or had been used by adults to impose stringent rules on them. During a 2017 TED talk, Harris said his greatest regret about the book was him transferring his fears into the book. He said: \\"Fear is never a good motive. Fear of messing up, fear of getting your heart broken, fear of hurting somebody else, fear of sex... There are clear things in statements in Scripture about our sexuality being expressed within the covenant of marriage. But that doesn't mean that dating is somehow wrong or a certain way of dating is the only way to do things. I think that's where people get into danger. We have God's word, but then it's so easy to add all this other stuff to protect people, to control people, to make sure that you don't get anywhere near that place where you could go off course. And I think that's where the problems arise.\\" In 2018, faith-based film company Exploration Films teamed with Harris to release a documentary entitled I Survived I Kissed Dating Goodbye. That same year, Harris stated that he reconsidered his view that dating should be avoided, apologizing to those whose lives were negatively impacted by the book and directing the book's publisher to discontinue its publication. In July 2019, Harris announced on Instagram that he and his wife, Shannon, were separating due to \\"significant changes [that] have taken place in both of us\\". Later that month, Harris announced that he was no longer a Christian. In August, Exploration Films announced they would halt distribution of I Survived, citing a lack of transparency from Harris on his faith. The company returned the rights back to director Jessica van der Wyngaard.

After attending the gymnasium of his native town, he studied at Marburg and Heidelberg, and then, attracted by the fame of Liebig, went in 1839 to Gie√üen, where he became a privatdozent in 1841, and professor of chemistry twelve years later. In 1864 he was called to Heidelberg in the same capacity, and he remained there till his death. Kopp devoted himself especially to physico-chemical inquiries, and in the history of chemical theory his name is associated with several of the most important correlations of the physical properties of substances with their chemical constitution. Much of his work was concerned with specific volumes, the conception of which he set forth in a paper published when he was only twenty- two years of age; and the principles he established have formed the basis of subsequent investigations in that subject, although his results have in some cases undergone modification. Another question to which he gave much attention was the connection of the boiling point of compounds, organic ones in particular, with their composition. In addition to these and other laborious researches, Kopp was a prolific writer. In 1843-1847 he published a comprehensive History of Chemistry, in four volumes, to which three supplements were added in 1869-1875\\\\. The Development of Chemistry in Recent Times appeared in 1871-1874, and in 1886 he published a work in two volumes on Alchemy in Ancient and Modern Times. Kopp, in studying heat capacities, found \\"that the molecular heat capacity of a solid compound is the sum of the atomic heat capacities of the elements composing it; the elements having atomic heat capacities lower than those required by the law of Dulong and Petit retain these lower values in their compounds.\\"See page 96 of In addition, Kopp wrote (1863) on theoretical and physical chemistry for the Graham-Otto Lehrbuch der Chemie, and for many years assisted Liebig in editing the Annalen der Chemie and the Jahresbericht.

It is the third of five collaborations between Castle and writer Robb White, and stars Vincent Price, Darryl Hickman, Patricia Cutts, Pamela Lincoln, Philip Coolidge, and Judith Evelyn. The film tells the story of a scientist who discovers a parasite in human beings, called a \\"tingler\\", which feeds on fear. The creature earned its name by making the spine of its host \\"tingle\\" when the host is frightened. In line with other Castle horror films, including Macabre (1958) and House on Haunted Hill (1959), Castle used gimmicks to sell the film. The Tingler remains most well known for a gimmick called \\"Percepto!\\", a vibrating device in some theater chairs which activated with the onscreen action. The Tingler received mixed reviews and is generally considered a camp cult film. Plot A pathologist, Dr. Warren Chapin (Price), discovers that the tingling of the spine in states of extreme fear is due to the growth of a creature that every human being seems to have, called a \\"tingler\\", a parasite attached to the human spine. It curls up, feeds and grows stronger when its host is afraid, effectively crushing the person's spine if curled up long enough. The host can weaken the creature and stop its curling by screaming. Movie theater owner Oliver Higgins (Coolidge), who shows exclusively silent films, is an acquaintance of Dr. Chapin. Higgins's wife Martha (Evelyn), is deaf and mute, and therefore cannot scream. She dies of fright after weird, apparently supernatural events appear in her room. During her autopsy, Chapin removes a tingler from her spine. After they contain the tingler and return to Higgins' house, it is revealed that Higgins is the murderer; he frightened his wife to death knowing that she could not scream because she was mute. The centipede-like creature eventually breaks free from the container that held it and is released into Higgins' theater. The tingler latches onto a woman's leg, and she screams until it releases its grip. Chapin controls the situation by shutting off the lights and telling everyone in the theater to scream. When the tingler has left the showing room, they resume the movie and go to the projection room, where they find the tingler and capture it. Guessing that the only way to neutralize the tingler is to reinsert it inside Martha's body, Chapin does so. After he leaves, Higgins, who has admitted his guilt to Chapin, is alone in the room. As if by supernatural forces, the door slams shut and locks itself and the window closes, echoing what happened just before Martha was frightened to death. The tingler causes the body of Martha to rise from the bed, staring at her husband. Higgins is so terrified that he is unable to scream. The screen fades, and Dr. Chapin's voice says, \\"Ladies and gentlemen, just a word of warning. If any of you are not convinced that you have a tingler of your own, the next time you are frightened in the dark ... don't scream\\". =Film prologue= In a similar manner as Universal's Frankenstein (1931), Castle opened the film with an on- screen warning to the audience: :\\"I am William Castle, the director of the motion picture you are about to see. I feel obligated to warn you that some of the sensations‚Äîsome of the physical reactions which the actors on the screen will feel‚Äîwill also be experienced, for the first time in motion picture history, by certain members of this audience. I say 'certain members' because some people are more sensitive to these mysterious electronic impulses than others. These unfortunate, sensitive people will at times feel a strange, tingling sensation; other people will feel it less strongly. But don't be alarmed‚Äîyou can protect yourself. At any time you are conscious of a tingling sensation, you may obtain immediate relief by screaming. Don't be embarrassed about opening your mouth and letting rip with all you've got, because the person in the seat right next to you will probably be screaming too. And remember‚Äîa scream at the right time may save your life.\\" Cast * Vincent Price as Dr. Warren Chapin * Judith Evelyn as Mrs. Martha Ryerson Higgins * Darryl Hickman as Dave Morris * Patricia Cutts as Isabel Stevens Chapin * Pamela Lincoln as Lucy Stevens * Philip Coolidge as Oliver \\"Ollie\\" Higgins Production The financial success of House on Haunted Hill was reason enough for Columbia to produce The Tingler. Price was on board again, with Hickman playing his assistant and newcomer Lincoln playing his sister-in-law. Cutts played Price's unfaithful wife Isabel. Castle convinced Hickman, who was Lincoln's real-life fianc√©, to join the cast as her fianc√© in the film. At first Hickman declined, but agreed after Castle convinced him it would help Lincoln's career. According to Hickman, Castle did such a good job of convincing him it would help Lincoln that he worked for no salary. Hickman, who was 5'10\\", was required to wear lifts for the scenes with 6'4\\" Vincent Price to offset the disparity of their heights. Evelyn was hired at the request of Price, who had worked with her on Broadway. She also received attention in another prominent \\"non-speaking role\\" as the suicidal \\"Miss Lonelyhearts\\" in Hitchcock's Rear Window (1954). Dal McKennon, the projectionist (uncredited in the film), had a successful career as the voice of many screen and TV characters, including \\"Buzz Buzzard\\" in the Woody Woodpecker cartoons and \\"Gumby\\" in the TV clay animation series. Jack Dusick, make-up artist for The Tingler, was the father of singer/actress Michele Lee. White, the story author, was partly inspired by his encounter with a centipede while living in the British Virgin Islands.Film Review: The Tingler (1959) at horrornews.net White had experimented with LSD at UCLA after hearing about it from Aldous Huxley and decided to work it into the script.TCM Behind the Scenes: The Tingler It is the first depiction of LSD use in a major motion picture. At the time, the drug was legal. The title of the book that Vincent Price's character reads before taking LSD‚ÄîFright Effects Induced by Injection of Lysergic Acid LSD25‚Äîis printed on the back of the book, not the front. This was done for a better shot of the expositional title of the book, explaining the effects of LSD to the audience. The Tingler was Price's second and final film with Castle and the fifth performance that would ultimately brand him as \\"The Master of Menace\\". The movie playing in the theater when the tingler escapes was the 1921 silent film Tol'able David. Analysis A subplot of the film involves the fates of a movie theater specializing in silent films and its owners. According to Kevin Heffernan, this reflects the conditions of the movie theater industry in the late 1950s. There were many discount theaters trying to establish their own market niche by showing older films. For the owners of these small theaters, it was a thankless and poorly paid job, as described in the trade journals of this period. When Ollie describes at length the work load involved in cleaning the building, he echoes real-life complaints.Heffernan (2004), p. 100-104 This provides the motive for his murder, as he is trying to escape a hopeless life. Another subplot involves dysfunctional married lives. Most prominent is that of Warren to Isabelle, who is clearly unfaithful to him. She stays out until the early hours of the morning and is seen giving her lover a farewell kiss. In another scene, Warren enters through the front door of his house and hears the back door slam. He then discovers two used glasses of wine and a forgotten tie clip.Brottman (2004), p. 273 In an argument between them, she does not deny her unfaithfulness, but counters by accusing her husband of neglecting her. While spending so many hours in his laboratory, he has lost contact with living people, leaving her no choice but to seek human affection elsewhere.Brottman (2004), p. 273 The marriage of Ollie and Martha is also an unhappy one. He claims that Martha would have killed him if she could.Brottman (2004), p. 273 Martha is depicted as a woman with a whole range of obsessive and phobic traits. She even communicates in a neurotic pantomime. Tim Lucas has described her as a silent film character in a sound film. The idea of a terrified, mute woman was not fully original. According to Heffernan, it was probably inspired by The Spiral Staircase (1946). The scene with the LSD trip offers a display of \\"stylized and exaggerated performance\\". The eyes of Warren shift from side to side, gazing suspiciously at his environment, while describing feelings of unease and apprehension. He loosens his tie, when he thinks himself unable to breathe. He opens a window while insisting that it is nailed shut. He sees a hanging skeleton as a moving figure, and describes the walls of the room as closing in on him. Finally he visibly struggles with the urge to scream, and succumbs to it. Gimmicks William Castle was famous for his movie gimmicks, and The Tingler featured one of his best: \\"Percepto!\\". Previously, he had offered a $1,000 life insurance policy against \\"Death by Fright\\" for Macabre (1958) and sent a skeleton flying above the audiences' heads in the auditorium in House on Haunted Hill (1959). =Percepto: \\"Scream for your lives!\\"= \\"Percepto!\\" was a gimmick where Castle attached electrical \\"buzzers\\" to the underside of some seats in theaters where The Tingler was screened. The buzzers were small surplus airplane wing deicing motors left from World War II. The cost of this equipment added $250,000 to the film's budget. It was used predominantly in larger theaters. During the climax of the film, The Tingler was unleashed in the movie theater, while the audience watched Tol'able David (1921), in which a young woman escapes the unwanted advances of her boyfriend and is targeted. In the real-life theater, a woman screamed and then pretended to faint; she was then taken away in a stretcher, all part of the show arranged by Castle. From the screen, the voice of Price mentioned the fainted lady and asked the rest of the audience to remain seated. The film- within-a-film resumed and was interrupted again. The projected film appeared to break as the silhouette of the tingler moved across the projection beam. The image of the film went dark, all lights in the auditorium (except fire exit signs) went off, and Price's voice warned the audience, \\"Ladies and gentlemen, please do not panic. But scream! Scream for your lives! The tingler is loose in this theater!\\"Browne (2001), p. 144 This cued the theater projectionist to activate the Percepto! buzzers, giving some audience members an unexpected jolt, followed by a highly visible physical reaction. The voices of scared patrons were heard from the screen, replaced by the voice of Price, who explained that the tingler was paralyzed and the danger was over. At this point, the film resumed its normal format, which was used for its epilogue. An alternate warning was recorded for drive-in theaters; this warning advised the audience the tingler was loose in the drive-in. Castle's voice was substituted for Price's in this version. Castle's autobiography, Step Right Up!: I'm Gonna Scare the Pants off America, erroneously stated that \\"Percepto!\\" delivered electric shocks to the theater seats.Castle (1976) Two Joe Dante films contain scenes which reference the \\"Percepto!\\" gimmick: Gremlins 2: The New Batch (1990) and Matinee (1993). =Fainting customers and medical assistance= To enhance the climax even more, Castle hired fake \\"screamers and fainters\\" planted in the audience. There were fake nurses stationed in the foyer and an ambulance outside of the theater. The \\"fainters\\" would be carried out on a gurney and whisked away in the ambulance, to return for the next showing. = \\"Bloody Bathtub\\" scene = Although The Tingler was filmed in black-and-white, a short color sequence was spliced into the film. It showed a sink (in black- and-white) with bright-red \\"blood\\" flowing from the taps and a black-and-white Evelyn watching a bloody red hand rising from a bathtub, likewise filled with the bright red \\"blood\\". Castle used color film for the effect. The scene was accomplished by painting the set white, black and gray and applying gray makeup to the actress to simulate monochrome. Reception Reviews of The Tingler were mixed, though praised for its camp qualities, with Time Out London calling the plot \\"ingeniously ludicrous\\". Lyz Kingsley of And You Call Yourself a Scientist! pointed out that \\"no film made before or after it quite matches it for its mix of the imaginative, the creepy, the funny, and the downright weird\\". Slant Magazine said, \\"Ludicrousness aside, Tingler is still one of the more confident Castle pictures: a well paced, at times intentionally, funny parody of 1950s domestication, with every couple in the story trying to off one another for a variety of amusingly convoluted reasons. Think Burn After Reading with dime store production values and a plastic spinal cord at its center.\\"Bowen, Chuck (Oct. 30, 2009), \\"DVD Review: The William Castle Film Collection on Sony Home Entertainment\\", Slant Magazine Dread Central called the film Castle's \\"magnum opus\\",Barton, Steve (May 8, 2014), Horror History: The First‚Äîand Only‚ÄîLook at Joe Lynch's The Tingler, Dread Central while Nerdist singled out Price's performance, saying, \\"Vincent Price is typically great and as always commits himself fully to the proceedings, even if it‚Äôs utterly absurd.\\"https://nerdist.com/schlock-awe-the- tingler/ Classic-Horror.com said \\"the acting is fine, the direction is among Castle's best, and the script is semi-brilliant for the time\\", and Harvey O'Brien of Harvey's Movie Review stated that \\"for all its flaws, The Tingler is very watchable and has been put together with enough canniness to be enjoyable on its own terms\\". Not all reviews were positive. Howard Thompson of The New York Times said, \\"William Castle has been serving some of the worst, dullest little horror entries ever to snake into movie houses\\". Home media Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released the film on DVD for its 40th anniversary in 1999. The film was later included on the William Castle Film Collection DVD set, released on October 20, 2009. Scream Factory (under Sony license) released a Blu-ray edition of the film in August 2018.

He has written on a wide range of topics, including the history of computing, the development of algorithms and intelligence, communications systems, space exploration, and the design of watercraft. Early life George Dyson is the son of the theoretical physicist Freeman Dyson and mathematician Verena Huber-Dyson, the brother of technology analyst Esther Dyson, and the grandson of the British composer Sir George Dyson. Dyson's early life is described in Kenneth Brower's book The Starship and the Canoe.Brower, K. (1978) The Starship and the Canoe, . New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston. When he was sixteen he went to live in British Columbia to pursue his interest in kayaking. From 1972 to 1975, he lived in a treehouse at a height of 30 metres that he built from salvaged materials on the shore of Burrard Inlet. Dyson became a Canadian citizen and spent 20 years in British Columbia, designing kayaks, researching historic voyages and native peoples, and exploring the Inside Passage. He was, during this period, estranged from his father for some time. Career Dyson's first book, Baidarka, published in 1986, described his research on the history of the Aleut kayak, its evolution in the hands of Russian fur traders, and his adaptation of its design to modern materials. He is the author of Project Orion: The Atomic Spaceship 1957‚Äì1965 and Darwin Among the Machines: The Evolution of Global Intelligence, in which he expands upon the premise of Samuel Butler's 1863 article of the same name and suggests that the Internet is a living, sentient being. His 2012 book Turing's Cathedral has been described as \\"a creation myth of the digital universe.\\" It was a finalist for the Los Angeles Times 2012 Book Prize in the science and technology category and was chosen by University of California Berkeley's annual \\"On the Same Page\\" program for the academic year 2013‚Äì14. Dyson is the founder/owner of Dyson, Baidarka & Company, a designer of Aleut-style skin kayaks; he is credited with the revival of the baidarka style of kayak. Dyson was a visiting lecturer and research associate at Western Washington University's Fairhaven College and was Director's Visitor at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, in 2002‚Äì03. He is a frequent contributor to the Edge Foundation. Personal life Lauren is the daughter of Ann Yow-Dyson and George Dyson. He lives and works in Bellingham, Washington.

She was launched in 1912 from Sandefjord in Norway; three years later, she was crushed by pack ice and sank in the Weddell Sea off Antarctica. All of her crew survived. Design and construction Designed by Ole Aanderud Larsen, Endurance was built at the Framn√¶s shipyard in Sandefjord, Norway, and fully completed on 17 December 1912. She was built under the supervision of master wood shipbuilder Christian Jacobsen, who was renowned for insisting that all men in his employment were not just skilled shipwrights but also be experienced in seafaring aboard whaling or sealing ships. Every detail of her construction had been scrupulously planned to ensure maximum durability: for example, every joint and fitting was cross-braced for maximum strength. The ship was launched on 17 December 1912 and was initially christened Polaris (eponymous with Polaris, the North Star). She was long, with a beam, and measured 348 tons gross. Her original purpose to provide luxurious accommodation for small tourist and hunting parties in the Arctic as an ice-capable steam yacht. As launched she had 10 passenger cabins, a spacious dining saloon and galley (with accommodation for two cooks), a smoking room, a darkroom to allow passengers to develop photographs, electric lighting and even a small bathroom. Though her hull looked from the outside like that of any other vessel of a comparable size, it was not. She was designed for polar conditions with a very sturdy construction. Her keel members were four pieces of solid oak, one above the other, adding up to a thickness of , while its sides were between and thick, with twice as many frames as normal and the frames being of double thickness. She was built of planks of oak and Norwegian fir up to thick, sheathed in greenheart, an exceptionally strong and heavy wood. The bow, which would meet the ice head-on, had been given special attention. Each timber had been made from a single oak tree chosen for its shape so that its natural shape followed the curve of the ship's design. When put together, these pieces had a thickness of . Shackleton looking overboard at Endurance being crushed by the ice Endurance's final sinking, November 1915 Of her three masts, the forward one was square-rigged, while the after two carried fore and aft sails, like a schooner. As well as sails, Endurance had a coal-fired steam engine capable of speeds up to . By the time of her launch in 1912, Endurance was perhaps the strongest wooden ship ever built, with the possible exception of Fram, the vessel used by Fridtjof Nansen and later by Roald Amundsen. There was one major difference between the ships. Fram was bowl-bottomed, which meant that if the ice closed in against her, the ship would be squeezed up and out and not be subject to the pressure of the ice compressing around her. Endurance, on the other hand, was designed with great inherent strength in her hull in order to resist collision with ice floes and to break through pack ice by ramming and crushing; she was therefore not intended to be frozen into heavy pack ice, and so was not designed to rise out of a crush. In such a situation she was dependent on the ultimate strength of her hull alone. Ownership Endurance was originally built for Adrien de Gerlache and Lars Christensen, who intended to use her for polar cruises for tourists to hunt polar bears. Financial problems led to Gerlache pulling out of their partnership, leaving Christensen unable to pay the Framn√¶s yard the final amounts to hand over and outfit the ship. For over a year Christensen attempted unsuccessfully to sell the ship, since her unique design as an ice-capable passenger-carrying ship, with relatively little space for stores and no cargo hold, made her useless to the whaling industry. Meanwhile, she was too big, slow and uncomfortable to be a private steam yacht. In the event, Christensen was happy to sell the ship to Ernest Shackleton for GB¬£11,600, which represented a significant loss to Christensen as it barely covered the outstanding payments to Framn√¶s, let alone the ship's total build costs. He is reported to have said he was happy to take the loss in order to further the plans of an explorer of Shackleton's stature. After Shackleton purchased the ship, she was rechristened Endurance after the Shackleton family motto, Fortitudine vincimus (\\"By endurance we conquer\\"). Shackleton had the ship relocated from Norway to London. She arrived at the Millwall Dock in the spring of 1914, where she was refitted and modified for expedition purposes. She was stripped of most of her luxurious accommodation and fittings. This included removing many of the passenger cabins to make room for space for stores and equipment, while the crew cabins on the lower deck were removed and converted into a cargo hold ‚Äì the reduced crew of sailors that Shackleton would take on the expedition would make their quarters in the cramped forecastle. The darkroom remained in its original location ahead of the boiler. The refit also saw the ship repainted from her original white color to a more austere black, which was more visible amongst ice, and features such as gilt scrollwork on the bow and stern were painted over. Despite her change of name, she retained a large badge in the shape of a five-pointed star on her stern, which originally symbolized her name after the pole star. Her new equipment included four ship's boats. Two were transom- built rowing cutters purchased secondhand from the whaling industry. The third was a larger double-ended rowing whaleboat built for the expedition to specifications drawn up by Frank Worsley, Endurances new captain. The fourth was a smaller motorboat. After her refit, Endurance made the short coastal journey to Plymouth. In the previous 16 years, nearly two dozen wooden vessels had sailed to the icy seas of the far south. All had returned home but Aurora. Lloyd's of London and the Indemnity Marine Assurance Company had underwritten her hull, machinery and equipment for ¬£15,000. Just before she sailed, The Times had reported that \\"Hitherto the insurance of vessels taking part in Antarctic exploration has ceased at the last port touched, and Endurance will be the first vessel to be insured in the ice zone.\\" The Times praised Endurance as \\"built specially for work in Polar seas\\", adding that \\"in an ice- coated sea there can be no turbulent waves which are the causes of so many disasters in warmer zones.\\" Final voyage Endurance sailed from Plymouth on 6 August 1914 and set course for Buenos Aires, Argentina, under Worsley's command. Shackleton remained in Britain, finalising the expedition's organization and attending to some last-minute fundraising. This was Endurance's first major voyage following its completion and amounted to a shakedown voyage. The trip across the Atlantic took more than two months. Built for the ice, her hull was considered by many of her crew too rounded for the open ocean. Shackleton took a steamer to Buenos Aires and caught up with his expedition a few days after Endurance's arrival. On 26 October 1914, Endurance sailed from Buenos Aires to what would be her last port of call, the whaling station at Grytviken on the island of South Georgia, where she arrived on 5 November. She left Grytviken on 5 December 1914, heading for the southern regions of the Weddell Sea. Two days after leaving South Georgia, Endurance encountered polar pack ice and progress slowed to a crawl. For weeks Endurance worked its way through the pack, averaging less than per day. By 15 January 1915, Endurance was within of her destination, Vahsel Bay. By the following morning, heavy pack ice was sighted and in the afternoon a gale developed. Under these conditions it was soon evident progress could not be made, and Endurance took shelter under the lee of a large grounded iceberg. During the next two days, Endurance moved back and forth under the sheltering protection of the berg. On 18 January, the gale began to moderate and Endurance set the topsail with the engine at slow. The pack had blown away. Progress was made slowly until hours later Endurance encountered the pack once more. It was decided to move forward and work through the pack, and at 5:00 PM Endurance entered it. This ice was different from what had been encountered before, and the ship was soon amongst thick but soft brash ice, and became beset. The gale increased in intensity and kept blowing for another six days from a northerly direction towards land. By 24 January, the wind had completely compressed the ice in the Weddell Sea against the land, leaving Endurance icebound as far as the eye could see in every direction. All that could be done was to wait for a southerly gale to start pushing in the other direction, which would decompress and open the ice. In the early morning of 24 January, a wide crack appeared in the ice ahead of the ship. Initially across, by mid-morning the break was over a quarter of a mile (0.4 km) wide, giving the men on the Endurance hope that the ice was breaking up. But the break never reached the ship itself, and despite three hours under full sail and full speed on the engine, the ship did not budge. Over the next days, the crew waited for the southerly gale to release the pressure on the ice, but while the wind backed to the hoped-for south/southwest direction, it remained light and erratic. Occasional breaks in the ice were spotted, but none reached the ship and all closed up within a few hours. Trials were made on January 27 with cutting and breaking the ice around the ship by manual labour but this proved futile. On 14 February, an open channel of water opened up a quarter of a mile (0.4 km) ahead of the ship and dawn showed the Endurance was afloat in a pool of soft, young ice no more than thick, but the pool was surrounded by solid pack ice of in thickness, blocking the path to the open lead. A day's continual work by the crew saw them hack a clear channel long. This work continued through the following day (15 February) and, with steam raised, the Endurance was backed up within her pool as far as possible to allow the ship to ram her way through the channel. As the ship went astern for successive attempts, lines were attached from the bow to loosened blocks of ice, estimated to weigh 20 tons (18 tonnes), in order to clear the path. The pool proved too small for the ship to gain enough momentum to successfully ram her way clear and by the end of the day the ice began to freeze up again. By 3:00 PM, the Endurance had made of distance through the ice, with still to go to clear water. Shackleton decided that the consumption of coal and manpower, and the risk of damage to the ship, was too great and called a halt. =Drift= After this frustration, Endurance's boilers were extinguished, committing the ship to drift with the ice until released naturally. On 17 February, the sun dipped below the horizon at midnight, showing the end of the Antarctic summer. On 24 February, regular watches on the ship were cancelled, with the Endurance now functioning as a shore station. The ship had slowly drifted south and at this point was within of the intended landing point at Vahsel Bay. But the icy terrain between the ship and the shore was too arduous to travel while carrying the materials and supplies needed for the overland expedition. By March, navigational observation showed that the ship (and the mass of pack ice that contained it) was still moving, but now swinging towards the west-northwest and increasing in the speed of its drift, moving between the start of March and May 2, when the sun disappeared below the horizon and the dark Antarctic winter began. Still the men on the ship hoped for either a change in the weather which would break up the pack or that, by the spring, the warmer weather and the ship's northward drift would mean it was released. On 14 July 1915, Endurance was swept by a southwest gale, with wind speeds of , a barometer reading of and temperatures falling to . The blizzard continued until 16 July. This broke up the pack ice into smaller, individual floes, each of which began to move semi-independently under the force of the weather, while also clearing water in the north of the Weddell Sea. This provided a long fetch for the south-setting wind to blow over and then for the broken ice to pile up against itself while individual parts moved in different directions. This caused regions of intense localised pressure in the ice field. The ice began \\"working\\", with sounds of breaking and colliding ice audible to those on the ship through the next day. Breaks in the ice were spotted but none approached the ice holding the Endurance. During July the ship drifted a further to the north. On the morning of 1 August, a pressure wave passed through the floe holding the ship, lifting the 400-ton Endurance bodily upwards and heeling the ship sharply to its port side before it dropped into a pool of water, afloat again for the first time in nearly six months. The broken sections of floe closed in around the ship on all sides, jarring the Endurance forward, backwards and sideways in violent fashion against the other slabs of ice. After over a quarter of an hour, a force from astern pushed the ship's bow up onto the floe, lifting the hull out of the pressure and with a list of five degrees to her port side. A gale overnight further disturbed the floe, driving it against the starboard side of the hull and forcing a sheet of ice upwards at a 45-degree angle until it reached the level of the scuppers. Despite the ordeal of the past few days the ship remained undamaged. Two pressure waves struck the ship on 29 August without incident. On the evening of 31 August, a slow-building pressure gripped the Endurance, causing her hull and timbers to creak and shudder continuously. The ice around the ship moved and broke throughout the night, battering the port side of the hull. All was quiet again until the afternoon of 30 September, by which time there were signs of spring with ten hours of sunlight per day and occasional temperature readings above freezing. A large floe was swept against the Endurance's port bow and then gripped that side of the ship against the built-up ice and snow on her starboard beam. The ship's structure groaned and wracked under the strain. Carpenter Harry McNish noted that the solid oak beams supporting the upper deck were being visibly bent \\"like a piece of cane\\". On deck the ship's masts were whipping back and forth as their stepping points on the keel were distorted. Despite these disconcerting signs, Captain Frank Worsley noted that the strength of the ship's structure was causing the ice itself to break up as it piled against the hull ‚Äì \\"...just as it appears she can stand no more, the huge floe weighing possibly a million tons or more yields to our little ship by cracking across...and so relieves the pressure. The behaviour of our ship in the ice has been magnificent. Undoubtedly she is the finest little wooden vessel ever built....\\" Despite this, the ship's decks were permanently buckled following this ordeal. =Final destruction= By October, temperatures of nearly were recorded and the ice showed further signs of opening up. The floe which had been jammed against the ship's starboard side since July broke up on 14 October, casting the Endurance afloat in a pool of open water for the first time in nine months. On 16 October, Shackleton ordered steam to be raised so the ship could take advantage of any openings in the ice. It took nearly four hours for the boilers to be filled with freshwater melted from ice, and then a leak was discovered in one of the fittings and they had to be pumped out, repaired and then refilled. The following day a lead of open water was seen ahead of the ship. Only one boiler had been lit and there was insufficient steam to use the engine, so all the sails were set to try and force the ship into the loosening pack ice but without success. In the late afternoon of 18 October, the ice closed in around the Endurance once again. In just five seconds the ship was canted over to port by 20 degrees, and the list continued until she rested at 30 degrees, with the port bulwark resting on the pack and the boats on that side nearly touching the ice as they hung in their davits. This put the ship in a seemingly safe position ‚Äì instead of being pinched between two opposing masses of ice the Endurance had been pushed from starboard to port and further pressure from starboard would push her bodily upwards over the top of the port-side floe, which had actually collided with its counterpart under the ship's bilge. In any case, after four hours in this position, the ice drew apart and the ship returned to a level keel. The ice was relatively still for the rest of the month. On 20 October, steam was raised again and the engines tested. On 22 October, the temperature dropped sharply from to and the wind veered from southwest to northeast. This caused the loosening pack to compress against the Antarctic coast once again. On 23 October, pressure ridges could be seen forming in the ice and moving near the ship. The next day a series of pressure waves struck the Endurance, causing the ice around the ship to fracture into separate large pieces which were then tumbled and turned in all directions. The ship was shunted back and forth before being pinched against two floes on her starboard side, one at her bow and one at her stern, while on the port side a floe impacted amidships, setting up a huge bending force on the hull. Parts of the rigging were snapped under the strain. A large mass of ice slammed into the stern, tearing the sternpost away from the hull planking. Around the same time the bow planking was stove in, causing simultaneous flooding in the engine room and the forward hold. Despite using both the portable manual pumps and getting up steam to drive the main bilge pumps, the water level continued to rise. The main man-powered deck pumps did not work as their intakes had frozen and could only be restored by pouring buckets of boiling water onto the pump pipes from inside the coal bunkers and then playing a blowtorch over the intake valve. McNish constructed a cofferdam in the shaft tunnel to seal off the damaged stern area while the crew were arranged in spells of 15 minutes on, 15 minutes off on the main pump. After 28 hours of continuous work, the inflow of water had only been arrested ‚Äì the ship was still badly flooded. On 24 October, the damaged ship was wracked by further pressure waves. The port-side floe was pressed more heavily against the side, warping the keel along its length and causing near-continual creaks, groans, cracks and \\"screams\\" from the ship's timbers. The footplates in the engine room were pushed up and would no longer sit in place as the compartment was compressed. The planking of the ship's port side was bowing inwards by up to . At 10 PM, Shackleton ordered the ship's boats, stores and essential equipment to be moved onto the surrounding ice. In the afternoon of 25 October, the pressure of the ice increased further. The main deck of the Endurance buckled upwards amidships and the beams sheared. As the ice moved against her stern, the aft part of the ship was lifted up and the damaged sternpost and the rudder were torn away. This angle caused all the water in the ship to run forward, collecting in the bow where it then began to freeze. The action of the ice in the stern and the excessive weight in the bow caused the ship to sink into the ice bow-first. Under its own pressure, the ice then broke over the forecastle and piled up onto the deck in the forward part of the ship, further weighing this end of the ship down. Through all of this, the pumping operations had continued, but by the end of the day Shackleton ordered this to stop and for the men to take to the ice. During the course of the next day, parties were sent back to the ship to recover more supplies and stores. They found that the entire port side of the Endurance had been driven inwards and compressed, and the ice had entirely filled the bow and stern sections. The ship's Blue Ensign was hoisted up her mizzen mast so that she would, in Shackleton's word's, \\"go down with colours flying.\\" After a failed attempt to man-haul the boats and stores overland on sledges, Shackleton realised the effort was much too intense and that the party would have to camp on the ice until it carried them to the north and broke up. More parties were sent back to the Endurance, still with her masts and rigging intact and all but her bow above the ice, to salvage any remaining items. A large portion of provisions had been left on the submerged lower deck. The only way to retrieve them was to cut through the main deck, which was more than a foot thick in places and itself under three feet of water. Some crates and boxes floated up once a hole had been cut, while others were retrieved with a grapple. In total, nearly 3.5 tons of stores were recovered from the wrecked ship. The party was still camped under from the remains of the Endurance on 8 November when Shackleton returned to the ship to consider further salvage. By now the ship had sunk a further into the ice and the upper deck was now almost level with the ice. The interior of the ship was almost full of compacted ice and snow, making further work impossible. The damage to the bow and stern, and the force of the ice against the port side, had caused a large portion of the hull on that side of the ship to break free of the rest of the ship and, under the force of the ice, be moved bodily inwards in a telescoping effect. In some places, the outer hull planks were now in line with the keel. A stash of empty fuel oil cans placed against the port side wall of the deckhouse had been pushed through the wall and then the cans and the wall had come to rest against its counterpart on the starboard side of the deckhouse. The row of five cabins that had been on the port side of the main deck above the engine room and their contents had been compressed into the space of a single cabin. On 13 November, a new pressure wave swept through the pack ice. The forward topgallant mast and topmasts collapsed as the bow was finally crushed. These moments were recorded on film by expedition photographer Frank Hurley. The mainmast was split near its base and shortly afterwards the mainmast and the mizzen mast broke and collapsed together, with this also filmed by Hurley. The ensign was re-rigged on the tip of one of the foremast yardarms which, constrained by the rigging, was now hanging vertically from the remains of the foremast and was the highest point of the wreck. In the late afternoon of 21 November, movement of the remaining wreckage was noticed as another pressure wave hit. Within the space of a minute, the stern of the Endurance was lifted clear of the ice as the floes moved together and then, as the pressure passed and they moved apart, the entire wreck fell into the ocean. By daylight the following day, the ice surrounding the spot where the Endurance had sank had moved together again, obliterating any trace of the wreck. Worsley fixed the position as 68¬∞ 38.5'S 52¬∞ 58'W. Crew The crew of Endurance on her final voyage was made up of the 28 men listed below:Endurance's crew * Sir Ernest Shackleton, Expedition Leader * Frank Wild, Second-in-Command * Frank Worsley, Captain * Lionel Greenstreet, First Officer * Tom Crean, Second Officer * Alfred Cheetham, Third Officer * Hubert Hudson, Navigator * Lewis Rickinson, Engineer * Alexander Kerr, Engineer * Alexander Macklin, Surgeon * James McIlroy, Surgeon * Sir James Wordie, Geologist * Leonard Hussey, Meteorologist * Reginald James, Physicist * Robert Clark, Biologist * Frank Hurley, Photographer * George Marston, Artist * Thomas Orde-Lees, Motor Expert and Storekeeper * Harry \\"Chippy\\" McNish, Carpenter * Charles Green, Cook * Walter How, Able Seaman * William Bakewell, Able Seaman * Timothy McCarthy, Able Seaman * Thomas McLeod, Able Seaman * John Vincent, Boatswain * Ernest Holness, Stoker * William Stephenson, Stoker * Perce Blackborow, Steward * Mrs Chippy, Ship's Cat =Nationalities= All crew members were born and resident in England before the expedition, except for the following: * Shackleton, Irish * Worsley, New Zealander * Greenstreet, New Zealander * Crean, Irish * Macklin, Indian * McIlroy, Irish * Wordie, Scottish * Hurley, Australian * Clark, Scottish * McNish, Scottish * Bakewell, American (may have claimed to be Canadian when he applied to join the expedition in Buenos Aires) * McCarthy, Irish * Blackborow, Welsh * Edgar Smith, Irish * Green, British Perce Blackborow was originally refused a post aboard the vessel due to his young age and inexperience, and instead decided to stowaway with help from his friend William Bakewell and Walter How. When his presence aboard the Endurance was discovered, Shackleton decided to make him a steward rather than leave him ashore at South Georgia. Blackborow eventually proved his worth, earning the Bronze Polar Medal, and the honour of becoming the first human being ever to set foot on Elephant Island. His name is also the matter of some debate‚Äîit is sometimes spelled Percy, or Blackboro, or in other ways. Supposed advertisement To find crew for the Endurance, Shackleton reportedly placed an advertisement in the London Times, reading: When discussing the advertisement in the 1944 book Quit You like Men, Carl Hopkins Elmore quoted Shackleton as saying that \\"so overwhelming was the response to his appeal that it seemed as though all the men of Great Britain were determined to accompany him.\\" Although the advertisement was listed in Julian Watkins' The 100 Greatest Advertisements: 1852-1958, no trace has been found to date. Many sources have concluded that the story of Shackleton's advertisement is likely apocryphal. The crew did receive the recognition the advertisement promised; Time Magazine has deemed their voyage \\"the most storied epic of survival\\". Legacy American journalist Alfred Lansing's book Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage, first published in 1959, described the ordeal that Shackleton and his men endured aboard the ship and quickly became a bestseller. Two Antarctic patrol ships of the British Royal Navy have been named Endurance in honour of Shackleton's ship. The first , launched in May 1956 and awarded pennant number A171 sometime later, acted as an ice patrol and hydrographic survey ship until 1986. The second was bought from Norway in 1992 where she was named MV Polar Circle. She suffered severe flooding in 2008 due to procedural errors during maintenance and, despite being returned to the UK, was not repaired prior to being scrapped in 2016. Wreck of the Endurance In 1998, wreckage found at Stinker Point on the southwestern side of Elephant Island was incorrectly identified as flotsam from the ship. It instead was from the 1877 wreck of the Connecticut sealing ship Charles Shearer. In 2001, wreck hunter David Mearns unsuccessfully planned an expedition to find the wreck of Endurance. By 2003, two rival groups were making plans for an expedition to find the wreck, but no expedition was actually mounted. In 2010, Mearns announced a new plan to search for the wreck. The plan is sponsored by the National Geographic Society but is subject to finding sponsorship for the balance of the US$10 million estimated cost. A 2013 study by Dr. Adrian Glover of the Natural History Museum, London suggests the Antarctic Circumpolar Current could preserve the wreck on the seabed by keeping wood-boring \\"ship worms\\" away. A Weddell Sea Expedition to locate and possibly photograph the wreck using long-range Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) was underway in the Antarctic summer of 2018‚Äì2019. This expedition failed when the researchers' AUV was lost to the ice as well. The wreck itself is speculated to rest on flat terrain at around 3,000 metres, undisturbed by massive sediment disposition and little to no erosion.

One wire carries a varying voltage that represents the signal, while the other wire is connected to a reference voltage, usually ground. The main alternative to single-ended signaling is called differential signaling. There is also the historic alternative of ground return, rarely used today. Single-ended signaling is less expensive to implement than differential, but it lacks the ability to reject noise caused by: # differences in ground voltage level between transmitting and receiving circuits # induction picked up on the signal wire The main advantage of single-ended over differential signaling is that fewer wires are needed to transmit multiple signals. If there are n signals, then there are n+1 wires - one for each signal and one for ground. (differential signaling uses at least 2n wires.) A disadvantage of single-ended signaling is that the return currents for all the signals use the same conductor (even if separate ground wires are used, the grounds are inevitably connected together at each end), and this can sometimes cause interference (\\"crosstalk\\") between the signals. Standards Single-ended signaling is widely used, and can be seen in numerous common transmission standards, including: * RS-232 serial communications * PS/2 mouse and keyboard connectors * I¬≤C serial bus * TTL circuits * CMOS logic circuits * ECL circuits * Most parallel computer buses, such as: ** VMEbus ** PCI * VGA video connectors * SCSI interfaces for hard drives and other peripherals * Parallel ATA interfaces for hard drives and other peripherals Some kinds of connectors, though more often used for balanced pairs, are sometimes used for single-ended operation: * RCA jacks for audio signals * TRS phone connectors for audio signals Example The widely used RS-232 system is an example of single-ended signaling, which uses ¬±12 V to represent a signal, and anything less than ¬±3 V to represent the lack of a signal. The high voltage levels give the signals some immunity from noise, since few naturally occurring signals can create a voltage of such magnitude. They also have the advantage of requiring only one wire per signal. However, they also have a serious disadvantage: they cannot run at high speeds. The effects of capacitance and inductance, which filter out high-frequency signals, limit the speed.

Life Appayya Dikshitar was born as Vinayaka Subramanian in Adayapalam, near Arani in the Tiruvannamalai district, in the Krishna Paksha of the Kanya month of Pramateecha Varsha under the Uttara Proushthapada constellation of the Hindu calendar. His father‚Äôs name was Rangarajudhwari. Appaya had the name Vinayaka Subramanya after the Namakarana or naming ceremony took place. Acharya Dikshitar or Acchan Dikshitar was the younger brother of Appayya. Appayya studied the Hindu scriptures under his Guru, Rama Kavi. He completed the fourteen Vidyas while he was quite young. Dikshitar travelled widely, entering into philosophical disputations and controversies in many centers of learning. He had the rare good fortune of being revered and patronized in his own life-time by kings of Vellore, Tanjore, Vijayanagara and Venkatagiri. =Mission against attacks on Shaivism= Dikshitar threw himself heart and soul into this mission for several years and often had to face grave personal danger, which he did with courage and faith. He preached, organised and wrote incessantly, enlisting the cooperation of several enlightened monarchs. He undertook frequent travels and challenged his adversaries to open disputation, as was the custom of those days. He brought to bear on his widespread activities, his resourceful personality and created an atmosphere of tolerance and goodwill, in the place of the prevailing antipathies and narrow-mindedness. =The Great Yogi= In addition to his poetic skills and achievements on the philosophical propagations and Saivite missionary work, Dikshitar was a great Siddha-yogi. One of his yogic experiments was as great as it was thrilling. In the later years of his life, he was subject to attacks of colic pain. He was convinced that it was due to his Prarabdha and past karma. Whenever he wanted to meditate deeply or worship the Almighty, he made a bundle of his towel and put it in front of him. By his yogic power he transferred his malady to the towel and sat in meditation. His disciples watched the towel jumping about the place. To them he explained later that he transferred his ailment which was in the form of an evil spirit to the cloth and then took it back soon after his meditation was over. =Voluntary adoption of inebriation= About his mystic devotion, there is another story that is related to his work called Atmarpana-stuti. In this small work of fifty stanzas he makes the inner self melt as it were by his exquisite mystic poetry. We can see here the profound maturity of true devotion to the Supreme. It reflects the inner mental state of a great devotee, in whom the ego has become fully extinct. There is a traditional account of how this work came to be written. It appears once he wanted to test the maturity of his own devotion to the Lord. Hence he swallowed the juice of the \`datura' fruit, which introduces intoxication, and told his disciples that they should write down whatever he says, during the stage when his consciousness was disturbed. In the stage of inebriation generally all suppressed ideas would find release and come out into the open. And in his case it was the Atmarpana-stuti that came out. It is therefore also called Unmatta-panchasati. Works He was well read in every branch of Sanskrit learning and wrote as many works, large and small. Only 60 of them are, however, extant now. These include works on Vedanta, Shiva Advaita, Mimamsa, Vyakarana, Kavya vyakhyana, Alankara, and devotional poetry. By conviction he was an advaitin and true worship of Lord Siva was the religion of his heart. Though the followers of the Siva-advaita school claim him as belonging to their school, it is not so easy to determine whether he was more inclined to Sivadavaita or advaita. Sivadvaita is very much akin to Vishishtadvaita of Ramanuja, except for the role of Vishnu being taken by Shiva. He wrote the Chatur-mata-sara to illustrate the philosophical thoughts of the four prominent schools of interpretation of Brahma sutras. The Naya-manjari deals with advaita, the Naya-mani-mala with Srikanta mata, the Naya-mayukha-malika with Ramanuja's philosophy, and the Naya-muktavali with Madhva's philosophy. =Multi-faceted Vedanta= Among the Vedantic works of Appayya Dikshitar, the Siddhanta-lesha-sangraha is most famous. In this elaborate and original treatise, he brings together in one place, all different dialectical thinking belonging to the advaitic school. Traditional students of Vedanta begin their study of Vedantic commentaries only after studying this Siddhanta Lesha sangraha. All the different views of different subschools of advaita, like those of \`eka-jiva-vada', \`nana-jiva-vada', \`bimba-pratibimba vada' \`sakshitva-vada' etc. are all discussed and the contrary views properly explained in this work with Appayya Dikshitar's masterly touch. =Parimala= It is a Vedantic work, an extremely readable commentary on the very difficult commentary called Kalpataru by an advaitic teacher named Amalananda. That Kalpataru is itself a commentary on BhƒÅmatƒ´ by VƒÅcaspati Mi≈õra, which in turn is the famous commentary on the Sutra-Bhashya of Adi Shankara. While the Parimala follows the advaitic approach, Dikshitar has written another commentary Sivaarka-mani-deepika on the Brahmasutras. But this is written from the point of view of Siva-visishtadvaita.. These two works ‚Äì Sivaarka-mani-deepika and Parimala ‚Äì are his magnum opus both in bulk and importance. Though both are commentaries on the Brahma sutra, Parimala aligns itself to the advaitic interpretation while the other work expounds the Sivadvaita philosophy of Srikanta Shivacharya. Dikshitar's patron, King Chinna Bomma Nayak of Vellore made endowments for the maintenance of a college of 500 scholars who studied Sivaarka maniDipika under Sri Dikshitar himself, thus equipping themselves for the Saivite propaganda work, which had been organised with a view to stemming the tide of Vaishnavite attacks and encroachments. =Other schools as approximations to advaita= Dikshitar graphically describes Shivadvaita and Advaita which are very close to each other as the highest steps. He makes it clear in his work that Srikantha-Bhashya on the Brahmasutra has been written in very close approximation to the trend of thought of Adi Sankara in his own bhashya. Srikanta, according to Dikshitar, propagated his cult on the understanding that sagunopasana (Worship of name and form) is only the first step to nirgunopasana (Propitiation of the nameless and formless), and that it was the real intention of Srikanta that the final truth lies only in Advaita. Dikshitar's great dialectical skill is fully reflected in the work called 'Anandalahari chandrika', where he tries to narrow down the differences between the apparently divergent schools of thought.

Another class of land tenancy in France is named , whereby the rent is paid annually in banknotes. A farm operating under m√©tayage was known as a m√©tairie, the origin of some place names in areas where the system was used, such as Metairie, Louisiana. Origin and function M√©tayage was available under Roman law, although it was not in widespread use.Cato, Marcus Porcius De Re Rustica Capitula CXXXVI - CXXXVIICrook, J.A. (1967) Law and Life of Rome: 90 B.C. to A.D. 212 Cornell Univ. Press: Ithaca, NY. p. 157 It proved useful after the emancipation of Roman slaves as the newly freed peasants had no land or cash (the same phenomenon happened in Brazil and the USA when slavery was banned). In what is now northern Italy and southeastern France, the post Black Death population explosion of the late Middle Ages, combined with the relative lack of free land, made m√©tayage an attractive system for both landowner and farmer. Once institutionalized, it continued into the 18th Century, although the base causes had been relieved by emigration to the New World.. M√©tayage was used early in the Middle Ages in northern France and the Rhinelands, where burgeoning prosperity encouraged large-scale vineyard planting, similar to what the ancient Romans had accomplished using slave labor. The hyperinflation that followed the influx of Incan-American gold made M√©tayage preferable to cash tenancy and wage labour for both parties. Called complant, a laborer (in French prendeur, in Italian mezzadro) would offer to plant and tend to an uncultivated parcel of land belonging to a land owner (in French bailleur, in Italian concedente). The prendeur would have ownership of the vines and the bailleur would receive anywhere from a third to two-thirds of the vines' production in exchange for the use of his soil.Hugh Johnson, Vintage: The Story of Wine pg 116. Simon and Schuster 1989 This system was used extensively in planting the Champagne region.Excerpts from R. Dion‚Äôs ‚Äú Histoire de la Vigne et du Vin en France‚Äú Bailleur was also used as the name for the proprietor under m√©tayage. The contract still exists today in Switzerland.agrivalais.ch: \\"Contrat de m√©tayage dans la vigne\\" In the eighteenth century c. 75% of leased lands in western, southern and central France were sharecropped. North of the Loire it was only common in Lorraine.Sharecropping and Sharecroppers, T J Byres, page 18 In Italy and France, respectively, it was called mezzadria and m√©tayage, or halving - the halving, that is, of the produce of the soil between landowner and land- holder. Halving didn't imply equal amounts of the produce but rather division according to agreement. The produce was divisible in certain definite proportions, which obviously must have varied with the varying fertility of the soil and other circumstances and did in practice vary so much that the landlord's share was sometimes as much as two-thirds, sometimes as little as one-third. Sometimes the landlord supplied all the stock, sometimes only part - the cattle and seed perhaps, while the farmer provided the implements; or perhaps only half the seed and half the cattle, the farmer finding the other halves. Thus the instrumentum fundi of Roman Law was combined within m√©tayage.Crook, J.A. (1967) Law and Life of Rome: 90 B.C. to A.D. 212 Cornell Univ. Press: Ithaca, NY. p. 158 Taxes were also frequently divided, being paid wholly by one or the other, or jointly by both. In the 18th Century, m√©tayage agreements began to give way to agreements to share profits from the sale of the crops and to straight tenant farming, although the practice in its original form could still be found in isolated communities until the early 20th Century.Shaffer, John W. (1982) Family and Farm: Agrarian Change and Household Organization in the Loire Valley, 1500-1900 State University of New York Press: Albany. By 1929, there were still 200,000 M√©tayers, farming 11% of French cultivated land (same % in 1892). It was most common in Landes and Allier (72% and 49% respectively).Land Tenure and Political Tendency in Rural France: The Case of Sharecropping, S Sokoloff, European Studies Review, 1980, page 361 As the m√©tayage practice changed, the term colonat partiaire began to be applied to the old practice of sharing-out the actual crop, while m√©tayage was used for the sharing-out of the proceeds from the sale of the crops. Colonat partiaire was still practised in the French overseas departments, notably R√©union,\\"Le colonat partiaire\\" Clicanoo, Journal de l'Ile de la R√©union 15 May 2006 ; until 2006 when it was abolished.Art. L. 462-28, French National Assembly, Law No 2006-11 of January 5 2006 Journal officiel de la R√©publique Fran√ßaise of January 6, 2006; In France, there was also a system termed m√©tayage par groupes, which consisted of letting a sizeable farm not to one m√©tayer but to an association of several who would work together for the general good under the supervision of either the landlord or his bailiff. This arrangement got past the difficulty of finding tenants having sufficient capital and labour to run the larger farms. In France, since 1983, these m√©tayage and similar farming contracts have been regulated by Livre IV of the Rural Code.French Rural Code Livre IV Baux ruraux Localities The system was once universal in certain provinces of Italy and France, and survived there in places until the end of the nineteenth century.

Vers un outil d'√©valuation pour les communaut√©s\\" (Roy, ME: MSc thesis, 2006) Criticism British writers were unanimous in condemning the m√©tayage system, until John Stuart Mill adopted a different tone. They judged it by its appearance in France, where under the ancien r√©gime all direct taxes were paid by the m√©tayer with the noble landowner being exempt. With the taxes being assessed according to the visible produce of the soil, they operated as penalties upon productiveness. Under this system, a m√©tayer could fancy that his interest lay less in exerting himself to augment the total share to be divided between himself and his landlord and instead be encouraged to defraud the latter part of his rightful share. This was partly due to the m√©tayer's relative state of destitution and with the fixed duration of his tenure - without which the metayage could not prosper. French metayers, in Arthur Young's time, were \\"removable at pleasure, and obliged to conform in all things to the will of their landlords,\\" and so in general they so remained.Cruveilhier, J. (1894) √âtude sur le m√©tayage Paris. In 1600, the landlord Olivier de Serres wrote 'Le th√©√¢tre de l'agriculture' which recommends M√©tayage as cash tenants took all the risks so would demand lower rent while hired labour was expensive to manage.The Economic Theory of Sharecropping in Early Modern France, Philip Hoffman, The Journal of Economic History 1984, page 312 Simonde de Sismondi expressed dissatisfaction in 1819 with the institution of m√©tayage because it reinforced the poverty of the peasants and prevented any social or cultural development.de Sismondi, Simonde (1819) Nouveaux principes d'economie politique, ou de la Richesse dans ses rapports avec la population translated as New Principles of Political Economy of Wealth in Its Relation to Population by Richard Hyse, Transaction Publishers: London (1991). Yet even in France, although m√©tayage and extreme rural poverty usually coincided, there were provinces where the contrary was the case, as it also was in Italy, especially on the plains of Lombardy. M√©tayage, in order to be in any measure worthy of commendation, must be a genuine partnership, one in which there is no sleeping partner, but in the affairs of which the landlord, as well as the tenant, takes an active part. Wherever this applied, the results of m√©tayage appeared to be as eminently satisfactory, as they were decidedly the reverse wherever the landlords held themselves aloof. Cruveilhier, J.

The terms may have slightly different meanings in the military of other countries. BD Between decks: applies to a naval gun mounting in which part of the rotating mass is below the deck, and part of it is above the deck. This allows for a lower profile of turret, meaning that turrets need not be superfiring (i.e. they can be mounted on the same deck and not obstruct each other at high angles of elevation.) BL BL 9.2 inch howitzer Mk II, showing position of obturating pad at far right The term BL, in its general sense, stood for breech loading, and contrasted with muzzle loading. The shell was loaded via the breech (i.e. the gunner's end of the barrel, which opened) followed by the propellant charge, and the breech mechanism was closed to seal the chamber. Breech loading, in its formal British ordnance sense, served to identify the gun as the type of rifled breechloading gun for which the powder charge was loaded in a silk or cloth bag and the breech mechanism was responsible for \\"obturation\\" i.e. sealing the chamber to prevent escape of the propellant gases. The term BL was first used to refer to the Armstrong breechloaders, introduced in 1859. Following the discontinuation of Armstrong breechloaders and the period of British rifled muzzle-loaders (RML), British breechloaders were re-introduced in 1880. At this point the term RBL was retrospectively introduced to refer to the Armstrong breechloaders, which had a totally different breech mechanism, and since then the term BL has applied exclusively to the type of breechloader introduced from 1880 onwards using interrupted-screw breeches. Early British Elswick breechloaders in the 1880s used a steel \\"cup\\" obturation method. This was quickly superseded in guns designed by the Royal Gun Factory by the French de Bange method, the basic principle of which is still in use today. In British service this became a Crossley pad with an interrupted thread screw block e.g. a Welin screw. The shell was loaded via the breech, followed by the propellant charge in a cloth bag. A single-use \\"vent sealing tube\\", a type of primer not dissimilar in appearance to a blank rifle round, was inserted into the breech for firing the gun. While originally, the term \\"BL\\" contrasted with \\"ML\\", or \\"muzzleloader\\" guns, after muzzleloaders were discontinued, the term came to distinguish between traditional, non-obturating guns with fabric propellant bags and separately loaded shells, and quick-firing QF guns which used self-sealing brass cartridge cases, and which usually had the propellant and projectile fixed together as a unit for faster handling and loading. For instance, Britain before World War I had both QF and BL 6 inch guns. Both were \\"breech loading\\" in the general sense, but in the formal nomenclature it separated 6-inch guns with breeches designed for charges in brass cartridge cases (QF) from those designed for cloth bag charges (BL). Shells designed for one type were not necessarily suitable for use in the other type; for instance, a BL shell relied upon the tight fit of its driving band in the gun bore to prevent it slipping back when the gun was elevated, but a QF shell could rely upon the cartridge case, either fixed or separate, to prevent it slipping back. This presented difficulties for BL guns at high angles. A special cartridge was developed for BL 9.2 inch guns on HA mountings, with provision for a wooden (beech) stick to be inserted through the centre to prevent the shell slipping back on elevation. Although fixed ammunition allows for a rapid rate of fire in small to medium guns, BL is a better choice for heavy calibre guns; propellant was loaded in a number of small fabric bags, because a single bag holding the full charge would be far too big and bulky for the handlers to lift. Using fabric allows for the charge to be broken into small, easily handled units, while it would be difficult to design a system by which multiple small metallic-cased charged were loaded and fired at the same time. Using multiple small fabric bags also allows the gunners to use a reduced charge if need be. BLC The term \\"BLC\\" stood for \\"BL converted\\" and referred to a breech and breech mechanism modified from an early long-screw three- or four-motion to modern short-screw single-motion.W L Ruffell, Breech Mechanisms An example is the conversion of the BL 15 pounder to BLC 15 pounder. C.R.H. 2 C.R.H. BL 9.2 inch howitzer shell, 1916. See \\"18.4 R\\" pointing to curve of nose 3 C.R.H. QF 4.5 inch howitzer shell, 1916. See \\"13.5 R\\" pointing to curve of nose Calibre radius head: the radius of a circle with the curve of the shell's nose on its circumference, expressed in terms of the shell's calibre. The longer and more pointed (and hence streamlined) the shell's nose, the higher the C.R.H. Typical C.R.H. for British shells leading up to World War I was two: e.g. the curve of the nose of a two C.R.H. six-inch shell was equivalent to the curve of a circle with a radius of 12 inches. Shells of four C.R.H. were soon developed in World War I, identified by an A following the shell mark number, B for six, and so on. For modern streamlined shells post-World War I, two numbers were necessary to more correctly denote a shell's C.R.H. characteristics. For instance, the World War I 6 inch 26 cwt howitzer shell was two C.R.H., the World War II Mk 2D shell was referred to as \\"5/10 C.R.H.\\".Detailed explanations and Projectiles Cartridge cordite SC 280 ¬º charge for BL 15 inch naval gun, WWII. Four of these cartridges were loaded together to make up the full service charge BL 6 inch 30 cwt howitzer Cartridge in brass case for a QF 4.5 inch howitzer \\"Cartridge\\" in British ammunition terminology typically refers to the physical object containing the propellant that a gunner loads: *For small arms (SA) and fixed QF artillery ammunition e.g. the .303 or 18-pounder respectively, this denoted the complete round, i.e. cartridge case, percussion cap or primer, propellant charge and projectile. In this use it is synonymous with \\"round\\". *For separate QF artillery, cartridge referred to the cartridge case, its primer, propellant charge, and the disposable lid and fastener of the case. *In BL artillery terminology, cartridge referred to the propellant unit only - there was no case. British cartridges up to approximately 1892 contained gunpowder, and thereafter sticks of cordite bound up together with an igniter pad if necessary, in a cloth bag, usually silk. The \\"stick\\" nature of cordite gave the cartridges a degree of rigidity and hence they retained a tubular shape and could be handled and loaded as a solid unit even without a case. With BL, cordite is contained in one or more cloth bags joined together. The complete unit is termed a cartridge. The empty bag was termed an \\"empty cartridge\\". Heavy naval guns may require up to (e.g.) four separate cartridges to be loaded, each consisting of a ¬º charge to make up the full service charge. Howitzer cartridges, both BL and separate QF, contained a central core of cordite surrounded by several stacked bags in the shape of rings, containing cordite. To obtain the appropriate \\"charge\\" for the required range and angle of elevation, the gunner removed and discarded one or more rings before loading. See charge for how QF 25-pounder charges varied in World War II. Cartridge case Cartridge cases and complete round for the .455 Webley The case, usually brass, holding the propellant charge. Used with small arms and QF artillery ammunition. The QF cases in 1915 could be cleaned and then reloaded up to a maximum of six firings with Cordite charges, with the record detailing the \\"life of the case\\" marked on the base. The limitation on the number of firings was due to the case expanding on firing, having to be \\"rectified\\" by turning metal off the lower part, which restored the correct dimensions but progressively weakened the case. Charge BL 6 inch gun cartridge of two half charges laced together to provide a full charge Charge was a concept or category label rather than a specific item. It can be described as \\"the standard amount of propellant specified to carry out a particular purpose\\" :- *Full service charge : the full amount of propellant intended for use in action at maximum range, for the usual shell. If a gun had e.g. a \\"heavy\\" and a \\"light\\" shell, there would be a separate Charge associated with the heavy and light shells. *Reduced service charge : for practice or firing star shells (which were lighter than the normal shell). *Proof charge : a charge giving 25% greater chamber pressure than the full service charge, intended only for the \\"proof\\" or testing of a gun. *Blank charge : intended for firing without a projectile, usually a reduced charge. *Battering charge : a specially large charge for use with \\"Palliser\\" projectiles, which were an early British armour-piercing projectile of the mid-to-late 19th century. For practical purposes, specific cartridges were specified for use to obtain the required charge. A gunner dealt with cartridges and would know that he could load (e.g.) cartridge X or Y for a full service charge for his gun, and cartridge Z to fire a star shell. Cartridges were sometimes made up of fractions of charges e.g. a 6-inch gun cartridge may be made up of 2 x 1/2 charges or 1 x 2/5 and 1 x 3/5 charge laced together. A gun normally fired all rounds using the full charge, and varied the range by elevating or depressing the barrel. A howitzer gunner's job was more complicated because the range table would specify different \\"charges\\", or fractions of the full service charge, for different ranges and angles of shell descent. The standard cartridge for his gun which as a whole made up the full service charge, would consist of a central \\"mushroom\\" Cordite core and several smaller Cordite rings in bags stacked around the core like doughnuts, all tied together. It was designed so that one or more rings could be quickly removed and discarded before loading, hence providing progressively smaller charges. e.g. if the gunner on a QF 4.5 inch howitzer was ordered to load charge four he would know he had to remove the top ring from the cartridge, leaving four rings; for charge three he would remove two rings. Discarded rings were burned after the action. This was the standard procedure for howitzers up to and including World War II. QF 25 pounder cartridge case In World War II a different system was introduced for varying charges for the QF 25 pounder gun-howitzer, which used separate-loading QF ammunition. A separate 2.7 lb \\"super charge\\" cartridge was available for firing the 20-pound high-velocity anti-tank AP shot, and an additional 4.5oz \\"super charge increment\\" could be added to that for even higher velocity. The cartridge for firing the standard 25-pound shell came ready-loaded with a red bag at the bottom containing the basic charge (charge one), together with white and blue bags laid lengthwise, as in a conventional gun charge, to make up the full service charge (charge three). The blue and white bags could be removed to provide progressively reduced charges (charge two and charge one). From 1944 one or two 4oz \\"intermediate charge increments\\" could be added to the standard charge (replacing the blue bag) for high-angle fire and to provide greater control over angle of shell descent.See Nigel F Evans's website for detailed explanation of 25 pounder charges For small arms or fixed QF ammunition, where the charge could not be varied by the gunner, the term charge was used to identify the Cordite propellant within the cartridge case, and the round as a whole was referred to as a full or reduced charge. E.g. an 18 pounder star round consisted of a cartridge case containing a reduced charge, and an attached star shell. Common lyddite C.R.H., showing shell wall thicker at base and exploders between nose fuze and lyddite filling British explosive shells filled with Lyddite were initially designated \\"common lyddite\\" and beginning in 1896 were the first British generation of modern \\"high explosive\\" shells. Lyddite is picric acid fused at 280 ¬∞F and allowed to solidify, producing a much denser dark-yellow form which is not affected by moisture and is easier to detonate than the liquid form. Its French equivalent was \\"melinite\\", Japanese equivalent was \\"shimose\\". Common lyddite shells \\"detonated\\" and fragmented into small pieces in all directions, with no incendiary effect. For maximum destructive effect the explosion needed to be delayed until the shell had penetrated its target. Early shells had walls of the same thickness for the whole length, later shells had walls thicker at the base and thinning towards the nose. This was found to give greater strength and provide more space for explosive. Later shells had 4 c.r. heads, more pointed and hence streamlined than earlier 2 c.r.h. designs. Proper detonation of a lyddite shell would show black to grey smoke, or white from the steam of a water detonation. Yellow smoke indicated simple explosion rather than detonation, and failure to reliably detonate was a problem with lyddite, especially in its earlier usage. To improve the detonation \\"exploders\\" with a small quantity of picric powder or even of TNT (in smaller shells, 3 pdr, 12 pdr - 4.7 inch) was loaded between the fuze and the main lyddite filling or in a thin tube running through most of the shell's length. Lyddite presented a major safety problem because it reacted dangerously with metal bases. This required that the interior of shells had to be varnished, the exterior had to be painted with leadless paint and the fuze-hole had to be made of a leadless alloy. Fuzes containing any lead could not be used with it. When World War I began Britain was replacing lyddite with modern \\"high explosive\\" (HE) such as TNT. After World War I the term \\"common lyddite\\" was dropped, and remaining stocks of lyddite-filled shells were referred to as HE (high explosive) shell filled lyddite. Hence \\"common\\" faded from use, replaced by \\"HE\\" as the explosive shell designation. Common lyddite shells in British service were painted yellow, with a red ring behind the nose to indicate the shell had been filled. For shellite, a successor of lyddite, see HE below. Common pointed QF 12 pounder common pointed shell Common pointed shells, or CP were a type of common shell used in naval service from the 1890s - 1910s which had a solid nose and a percussion fuze in the base rather than the common shell's nose fuze. The ogival two C.R.H. solid pointed nose was considered suitable for attacking shipping but was not armour-piercing - the main function was still explosive. They were of cast or forged (three- and six-pounder) steel and contained a gunpowder bursting charge slightly smaller than that of a common shell, a tradeoff for the longer heavier nose. In British service common pointed shells were typically painted black, except 12-pounder shells specific for QF guns which were painted lead colour to distinguish them from 12-pounder shells usable with both BL and QF guns. A red ring behind the nose indicated the shell was filled. By World War II they were superseded in Royal Navy service by common pointed capped (CPC) and semi-armour piercing (SAP), filled with TNT. Common shell BL 9.2 inch common shell, 1889 \\"Common shell\\" designated early (i.e. 1800s) British explosive shells filled with \\"low explosives\\" such as \\"P mixture\\" (gunpowder) and usually with fuzes in the nose. Common shells on bursting (they did not \\"detonate\\") tended to break into relatively large fragments which continued along the shell's trajectory rather than laterally. They had some incendiary effect. In the late 19th century \\"double common shells\\" were developed, lengthened so as to approach twice the standard shell weight, to carry more powder and hence increase explosive effect. They suffered from instability in flight and low velocity and were not widely used. As at 1914, common shells six inch and larger were of cast steel, smaller shells were of forged steel for service and cast iron for practice. They were replaced by \\"common lyddite\\" shells in the late 1890s but some stocks remained as late as 1914. In British service common shells were typically painted black with red bands behind the noses to indicate the shells were filled. CP In the CP mounting, the rotating mass (blue) is mounted on a fixed central pivot (red) bolted to the deck. Central pivot: was applied to a naval gun mounting that rotates around a central pivot that could be bolted to the deck without any structural alterations being required.  cwt  The abbreviation cwt stands for hundredweight, which, despite the name, is equal to , and signifies the weight of the gun barrel and breech. It is sometimes included in the name of a gun to differentiate it from other guns of the same caliber or weight of shot. For example, the QF 12 pounder 18 cwt naval gun is a different (and heavier) weapon than the QF 12-pounder 8-cwt Mk I naval gun, though they both fire shells of the same approximate weight (). DCT The director-control tower (DCT in British usage or \\"director\\" in US usage) was a feature of naval ships. It was a trainable turret incorporating the gun-laying sights and often a rangefinder. From here the gunnery officer could select targets and take the range, bearing and rates of change. This data would be provided to the transmitting station (TS), where a firing solution would be calculated and passed on to the gun turrets as the correct degree of training and elevation. Effective full charge (Note: The British Army term is usually equivalent full charge) Gun barrels naturally experience internal wear when fired, caused by mechanical wear from the projectile moving along the barrel, and thermal and chemical wear from propellant gases. This wear can reduce muzzle velocity and hence range, affect accuracy, produce unstable projectile flight, and, eventually, cause the gun barrel to fail. Most guns are capable of firing different types of ammunition with varying charges, and not all of these combinations produce the same firing damage per round fired. The concept of ‚Äòeffective full charge‚Äô provides a means of estimating the remaining life of a gun barrel taking into account the varying charges that can be fired from it before it becomes so worn as to be unusable, or no longer safe.Hasenbein, Richard G., 2003, Paper presented at the RTO AVT Specialists‚Äô Meeting on ‚ÄúThe Control and Reduction of Wear in Military Platforms‚Äù, Williamsburg, USA, 7‚Äì9 June 2003, published in RTO-MP-AVT-109. To illustrate, the round (i.e. the combination of projectile and propelling charge) that produces the most firing damage is assigned an effective full charge (EFC) value of ‚Äúone‚Äù. Other round combinations are assigned lesser values derived from testing and experience. If a gun barrel is capable of firing three different round types: round A (EFC = 1); round B (EFC = 0.75); and round C (EFC = 0.25), and if 100 of each round type is fired, then the barrel is said to have fired (100*1.00) + (100*0.75) + (100*0.25) = 200 EFCs. If it had previously been determined from testing and experience that this type of barrel has an estimated wear life of 250 EFCs, this specific barrel is at about 80% of its useful life. Plans would be made to order a replacement barrel within the time an additional 50 EFCs were expected to be fired. However the actual decision to retire any specific barrel would be made on examination and measurement of actual wear rather than that predicted by the EFC count. In practice a barrel might be replaced before reaching its EFC life, or the limits of wear. In the case of the 15-inch guns fitted to the World War I Marshal Ney-class monitors a gun was generally condemned when wear reached about 0.74 inches at one inch from the start of the rifling. However it was the usual practice to replace guns when their projected remaining life fell below the ship's normal full outfit of ammunition per gun, which ensured that the entire magazine could be safely fired in action. Equipment This was the term for a gun together with its carriage, i.e. the complete set of equipment needed to be able to fire the gun, as the gun could only be fired when mounted on its correct carriage. The carriage could be a wheeled carriage, a static siege carriage or include both a traversing mounting and railway wagon in the case of a railway gun. For example, a complete deployable gun might be described as ordnance QF 18 pdr gun Mk II on carriage, field, QF 18 pdr gun Mk I. Gunpowder Britain employed gunpowder as a propellant until superseded by Cordite Mk I from 1892, and as an explosive filling in common shells until slowly superseded by lyddite from the late 1890s. In World War I gunpowder was still in wide British use : *in shrapnel shells as a burster to propel the bullets out of the case *in \\"igniter pads\\" at the ends of cordite cartridges to facilitate ignition *as the delay mechanism in time fuzes for artillery *in vent tubes for firing guns. British gunpowder designations were : *E.X.E. : \\"extra experimental\\" : propellant : mixture of ‚Öî brown and ‚Öì black powders, used with BL 6 inch guns Mk III, IV & VI *L.G. : large grain : propellant *Mealed powder : powder in fine dust form : used to ignite fuzes, friction tubes *Prism or moulded powders : propellant pressed into regular hexagonal prism shape, with a hole in the centre to give even burning : included prism brown\\" (slower burning) and \\"prism black\\" (faster burning) *P : Pebble powder : propellant in cube shape, designed to reduce the ratio of surface area to weight, and hence to slow the rate of burning to reduce strain on guns. A larger weight of P (approximately 16% more) is required than R.L.G. for an equivalent charge. *S.P. : propellant : P specially selected for consistency, for use in BL guns *P mixture : mixture of pebble and fine grain powders : explosive : filled common and common-pointed shells *Q.F. mixture : explosive : filled medium-sized common and common- pointed shells *R.F.G.¬≤ : rifle fine grain : dogwood charred for eight hours : bursting charge for shrapnel and star shells *R.L.G. : rifle large grain : propellant; explosive filling for armour-piercing shells *S.B.C. slow-burning cocoa : propellant, brown powder (cocoa refers to the colour). Gas-check 12 inch automatic gas-check Attached to the base of RML artillery shells from 1878 onwards to avoid gas wastage on firing, and to rotate studless shells. It was an interim measure between studs and modern driving bands. Related terms: * \\"Attached gas-check\\" - used with studded ammunition * \\"Automatic gas-check\\" - used with studless ammunition * \\"Rotating gas-check\\" - synonymous with \\"automatic gas-check\\" (Note: The term \\"gas-check\\" was hyphenated in official British government publications of the late 1800s and early 1900s. These publications also used the term \\"automatic gas-check\\" while acknowledging that the term \\"rotating gas-check\\" had been used previously. HA QF 4-inch MK V gun on HMAS Canberra c. 1940 High angle: a naval designation equivalent to AA (anti aircraft), for a gun mounting which was capable of an elevation exceeding 50¬∞ from the horizontal, allowing the gun to be used against aircraft. HA/LA High angle / low angle : a naval designation, equivalent to \\"dual purpose\\", for a weapon intended for engaging both surface targets and aircraft, on a mounting capable of elevating above 50 degrees but also effective at low elevations. Typical examples were the QF 4 inch Mk XVI, QF 5.25 inch gun and QF 4.5 inch gun used in World War II and later. HE 9.2 inch howitzer. Red band indicates it is filled, green band marked \\"Trotyl\\" indicates filling is TNT. \\"HE\\" in British terminology initially designated only shells filled with modern \\"high explosive\\" such as Trotyl (the British term for TNT), which was being introduced when World War I began, and Amatol from 1915. It contrasted with common shells, which were filled with older explosives such as gunpowder, and common lyddite, the earlier British high- explosive shell. Britain also used Tetryl before World War I under the designation \\"composition exploding\\" (C.E.). The HE shell filling was detonated by a fuze, usually augmented by a \\"gaine\\" to ensure complete ignition, causing the thick steel shell case to shatter into large and small fragments at great velocity in all directions. Britain first used pure TNT for land warfare shells from late 1914, but this proved expensive and difficult to manufacture in the necessary large quantities, and was also inefficient as much energy was output as heavy black smoke. Amatol, a mixture of cheap ammonium nitrate and TNT (initially \\"40/60\\" : 40% ammonium nitrate and 60% TNT for land shells and 80/20 from 1917) proved 27% more powerful than pure TNT and was soon adopted as the preferred HE filling in World War I. TNT and Amatol were approximately 20% less sensitive to shock and hence safer than lyddite, and Amatol 80/20 cost only 7d per pound to produce in 1917 compared to 1s 11d for lyddite and 1s 3d for TNT.\\"History of the Ministry of Munitions\\" 1922, Volume X Part IV, pages 20-21. Britain was slow to move from 40/60 Amatol to the preferred 80/20 mixture during World War I, due to manufacturing difficulties. The preferred method for filling explosive shells was by pouring the molten mixture through the fuze hole in the shell nose or base. This was well suited to Lyddite filling, but it was found that Amatol with more than 40% ammonium nitrate did not pour well. Hence it was not simply a case of switching existing filling machinery from Lyddite to Amatol. Dry filling with Amatol 80/20 in block form and by pressing was used but was not considered to be a success. By the end of World War I the process for pouring 80/20 Amatol as a shell filling for land warfare shells had finally been perfected and was in large‚Äìscale production. The Royal Navy resisted switching from Lyddite to Amatol for its shells because it considered Amatol was too hygroscopic (water- absorbing) to be suitable for use at sea, and instead used pure TNT as its high-explosive replacement for Lyddite. After World War I, remaining stocks of Lyddite-filled naval shells were redesignated \\"H.E. shell filled Lyddite\\", and henceforth the term H.E. encompassed all Lyddite, TNT and subsequent high- explosive shell types. From 1919 into the 1930s a less sensitive and safer version of Lyddite named Shellite, consisting of 70% Lyddite and 30% dinitrophenol was used in naval AP shells.Tony DiGiulian, Definitions and Information about Naval Guns Part 2 - Ammunition, Fuzes and Projectiles Amatol continued in field use to 1945 when it began to be replaced by a 60/40 mixture of RDX and TNT. High-explosive shells were typically painted yellow in British service in World War I, with a red ring below the nose to indicate the shell was filled and a green ring round the body to indicate filling with TNT or Amatol. In World War II they were typically painted olive green. LA QF 4-inch Mk V guns on HMAS Waterhen circa 1930s Low angle: a naval designation for a gun mounting not capable of high angles of elevation, and intended solely for firing at surface targets. In theory any CP mounting was an LA mounting by default. ML Muzzle-loading. By World War II there were no muzzle loading artillery guns in British use, so ML was used only for mortars, as the mortar bomb was dropped tail-first down the barrel from the muzzle. Ordnance In British use, ordnance meant the barrel and breech, without mounting, of a gun. The gun with its mounting was called an equipment. For example, a complete deployable gun might be described as ordnance QF 18 pdr gun Mk II on carriage, field, QF 18 pdr gun Mk I. P In the P mounting, the rotating mass (blue) is mounted on a pedestal (red) which is fixed to the deck. P refers to a \\"pedestal\\" mounting for a gun, and was used by the Royal Navy. It differed from a central pivot mounting in that the mounting rotated around a fixed pedestal, rather than being bolted directly to the deck. Pounder Many British naval and army artillery pieces of this period continued to be categorised by their pound rating, the weight in pounds of the shell that they fired, rather than by their bore. For example, a gun firing 32-pound rounds was called a \\"32-pounder\\", abbreviated pdr. Larger guns, such as the RML 9 inch 12 ton gun, were more often categorised by their bore. This system was used until after World War II. A rough pound rating to bore conversion for that time is 1-pounder-37mm, 2-pounder-40mm, 3-pounder-47mm, 6-pounder-57mm, 17-pounder-76.2mm, 25-pounder-87.6mm, 60-pounder-127mm. Preponderance This term used in the 1800s specified the amount by which the breech end of a gun mounted on trunnions was heavier than the muzzle end. This was determined by the location of the trunnions, the lugs on the barrel by which it rotated in its mounting, which were usually located slightly forward of the gun's centre of gravity. E.g. if the preponderance was quoted as 4 tons 2¬Ω cwt as for the RML 17.72 inch \\"100-ton\\" gun, the breech end sat with that weight on its mounting, enough to ensure stability but not enough to hinder changes in elevation. The preponderance of British muzzle-loading guns was typically stamped on the end of one of the trunnions. The term was dropped when it became meaningless with the replacement of trunnions by more modern methods of mounting guns on recoil slides in the 20th century. QF Fixed QF 3 inch 20 cwt round The term QF came from \\"quick-firing\\". The designation was put into use in the late 19th century in two different meanings. In naval terms it was first used for small guns firing fixed ammunition i.e. a complete round formed from a metal (brass) cartridge case containing the propellant and projectile in one unit thus enabling higher firing rates. An early example was the QF 6 pounder Hotchkiss. In later pieces, the charge was sometimes separated from the shell to reduce the individual weight of loading, but the charge was still loaded in a brass case, rather than a cloth or silk bag typical of \\"BL\\" guns. In formal British ordnance terminology the term QF came to mean that the propellant charge is loaded in a metal, usually brass, case which provides obturation i.e. seals the breech to prevent escape of the expanding propellant gas. The term QF hence referred to both the breech- sealing mechanism and the method of loading propellant charges. Ordnance of other countries employed other techniques, and hence this description and distinction is limited to British ordnance. Following the early success of the light QF Hotchkiss and Nordenfelt guns in the 1880s, the Royal Navy implemented QF guns in all calibres up to 6 inch in the 1890s, and also converted various 4 inch and 6 inch BL guns to QF under the designation QFC. This all-QF era ended in 1901 with the BL 6 inch Mk VII gun and a swing back to BL guns. Since 1914 the trend has been to use QF for naval guns below 6 inch and BL for guns 6 inch and over. =Fixed QF= In lighter QF guns, including field guns and anti-aircraft guns, the round was complete: \\"fixed ammunition\\", where the shell was attached to the cartridge case like a large rifle round. Examples are QF 3 pounder Vickers, QF 18 pounder field gun, QF 4 inch Mk V anti-aircraft gun and the current 4.5 inch Mark 8 naval gun. Fixed QF was suited for rapid loading, especially at high angles, and was limited by the total weight of cartridge and projectile, which had to be easily handled by one man. A maximum total weight of approximately 80 lb was generally considered suitable for sustained manual loading of fixed ammunition rounds; for modern automatic loading guns since World War II the maximum weight is no longer the limiting factor. The Royal Navy gun standard was the 4.5 inch Mark 8 naval gun, using a fixed round weighing . =Separate QF= QF 15 pounder cartridge In other guns, typically naval guns 3 inches or above, such as the QF 12 pounder 12 cwt and QF 6 inch naval gun, and howitzers, such as the QF 4.5 inch howitzer and ordnance QF 25 pounder gun-howitzer, the projectile was loaded separately to the cartridge case containing the propellant: \\"separate ammunition\\". This system was suitable for howitzers as it allowed the gunner to remove part of the cordite charge before loading if required for shorter ranges. Separating the cartridge and projectile also allowed the weight of loading to be shared by two men. =Characteristics= In all types, the primer for the round was in the cartridge case base. The term QF in British use referred to the breech sealing mechanism, in which the brass cartridge case provided the gas seal. This allowed a sliding block, which can generally be operated faster than a BL screw mechanism, and is characteristic of small to medium artillery. Early QF guns offered the advantage over BL guns that no time was wasted in inserting vent tubes after loading, as the primer was built into the case, and sponging out of the chamber was not necessary between rounds. QF also removed the risk of back-flash. QF also, by rigidly fixing the position of the primer, igniter and cordite charge in the case relative to each other, improved the chances of successful firing compared to BL with its flexible bags. By the early 20th century British doctrine held that QF ammunition, while allowing faster-operating breeches, had the disadvantage that ammunition is heavier and takes up more space, which was limited on warships. For guns larger than 6 inches it becomes impractical as the cartridge case becomes unwieldy for manual operation, and it does not allow charges to be loaded via multiple bags as BL does. Also, dealing with misfires was simpler with BL, as another tube could simply be tried. With QF the gunner had to wait a time and then open the breech, remove the faulty cartridge and reload. Already by 1900, modern BL breeches allowed the gunners to insert vent tubes while the gun was being loaded, obviating one of the previous QF advantages, and hence the Royal Navy abandoned the QF 6 inch gun and returned to BL 6 inch guns with the Mk VII. Another potential disadvantage associated with QF came with the horizontal sliding block breech, as used with the QF 4.5 inch Howitzer. With the gun traversed at high elevation, the block could not be operated as it came into contact with the inside of the box carriage. Not all British QF guns in fact used sliding blocks - the QF 2.95 inch and QF 3.7 inch mountain guns and the QF 18 pounder used screw breeches. The thing to note is that their screw mechanism were much lighter and simpler than BL screw mechanisms and served merely to lock the cartridge in place. British artillery doctrine considered QF, even separate-loading, as unsuited for guns over 5 inches following experiences with the QF 6 inch in the 1890s, while European militaries such as Germany continued to use separate QF with sliding-block breeches for large guns up to 15 inches, with larger German guns loading part of the propellant charge in cloth bags followed by the main charge in the metal cartridge case. In colloquial use, quick firing is artillery having attributes like recoil buffers and quick shell loading characteristics, introduced in the late 19th century. QFC QF converted: in the 1890s there was much enthusiasm for QF technology, and many older BL guns had their breeches modified to use the same QF cartridges as the new QF guns of the same calibre. Examples were conversion of BL 6-inch Mk IV and VI guns which became e.g. QFC I/IV, and some BL 4-inch guns. QF SA Quick firing, semi- automatic: applied to naval QF guns where there was a mechanism to automatically open the breech and eject the case after firing. This was useful to enable a high rate of fire. An example was the QF 3 inch 20 cwt anti- aircraft gun. RBL RBL 12 pounder gun barrel and breech \\"Rifled breech loading\\": refers to the first generation of British rifled breech loading guns introduced in 1859 which used the unique Armstrong \\"screw breech\\" and included the RBL 12 pounder field gun and RBL 7 inch naval gun. These guns were originally known as \\"BL\\" (breech loading); the term \\"RBL\\" was introduced retrospectively in the 1880s to differentiate these Armstrong designs from the second unrelated generation of rifled breech loaders beginning in 1880 which are referred to as BL. The \\"RBL\\" guns were considered to be failures and Britain reverted to RML (rifled muzzle-loading) guns from the mid-1860s to 1880. Recuperator \\"Recuperator\\" was the British name for the mechanism which returned the gun barrel to its firing position after recoil. US ordnance uses the term \\"run-out cylinder\\". =Hydro-spring= Hydro-spring recoil system of 60 pounder Mk I, which failed at Gallipoli At the beginning of World War I runout after recoil was most commonly achieved in British 1904-vintage field guns and pre-1914 naval guns by a set of springs which were compressed when the barrel recoiled and then expanded again. This configuration was referred to as \\"hydro-spring\\" in which piston(s) moving through an oil reservoir dampened the recoil and springs collected the recoil energy and then used it to \\"run out\\" the barrel to firing position. Typical examples were in the QF 13 pounder, 18 pounder and BL 60 pounder Mk I guns, all dating from 1904 to 1905, where the oil, pistons and springs were integrated in a tubular housing above the barrel. This configuration made the entire recoil system vulnerable to enemy gunfire, and it was protected to some extent in the field by being wound with thick rope. Other guns, typically naval guns, had the pistons in separate housings below the barrel. Note that \\"hydro-\\" refers here to hydraulic machinery, not water: as is common in such systems, oil was the liquid used, not water. For other applications of this type of system, see hydrospring. =Hydro-pneumatic= The field-fitted hydro-pneumatic recuperator extension (above the barrel) for 18 pounder Mk II gun, WWI QF 4.7 inch naval gun, World War II When World War I began, both the army and navy were in the process of introducing a \\"hydro-pneumatic\\" recoil system in which the recuperators were driven by air compression rather than springs. Examples were the navy's new QF 4 inch Mk V gun and the army's new BL 9.2 inch howitzer. The unexpectedly heavy rates of fire experienced (mainly on the Western front) early in World War I caused many spring breakages in the 1904 generation field artillery (including in the Mk I 60 pounders at Gallipoli) and led to field modification of the 18 pounder which replaced the springs in the housing above the barrel with a pneumatic unit. By the end of the war the hydro-pneumatic system had become standard for a new generation of field artillery, typically seen in a box-shaped unit below the barrel in the 18 pounder Mk IV, 60 pounder Mk II, 6-inch and 8-inch howitzers and 6 inch Mk 19 gun. Ring shell See Segment shell RML common shell with gas-check, for RML 10 inch gun, 1886 RML 12.5 inch gun RML 12.5 inch gun showing studs Rifled muzzle loading: introduced in British service in the mid-1860s following the unsatisfactory service performance of the Armstrong RBL (rifled breech loading) guns. The inside of the barrel had spiral grooves into which \\"studs\\" on the shell fitted, to spin the shell and hence improve accuracy and range. The propellant charge, followed by the projectile, is loaded through the muzzle. \\"RML\\" became necessary to distinguish between the new rifled and old unrifled smoothbore muzzle loaders (ML). The first generation of British RML guns in the mid-1860s typically used William Armstrong's design of a wrought-iron \\"A\\" tube surrounded by multiple wrought-iron coils. Later marks of guns built by the Royal Gun Factory from the late 1860s onward introduced a toughened mild steel \\"A\\" tube to increase the gun's strength, and also used fewer but heavier coils to reduce the cost of manufacture. RML guns in British government service were designed by the Royal Gun Factory, Woolwich, and typically had only a few (three to nine) broad shallow rifling grooves, compared to the many sharp-edged grooves (\\"polygroove\\") of the Armstrong system. They were hence referred to as \\"Woolwich\\" guns. From 1878 onwards \\"gas-checks\\" were attached to the base of RML shells to seal the bore and reduce windage; it was also found that these gas-checks could be used to rotate the shell, allowing studs to be dispensed with, which was an improvement as the slots in the shell for studs were found to be weak points leading to shells fracturing. The gas-checks evolved into the driving bands still in use today. Modern RML examples are rifled field mortars. The largest RML gun built was the RML 17.72 inch gun, known as the 100-ton gun. In the 1870-80s four each went to the Italian ironclads Duilio and Dandolo, and two each to coastal batteries at Gibraltar and Malta. The last recorded active deployment of British RML guns was some RML 2.5 inch mountain guns in German East Africa in 1916, although several batteries of RML 9 inch Mk VI high-angle coast defence guns were in service in England throughout World War I. Round The complete set of components needed to fire the gun once. Consists of a projectile, a propellant cartridge and primer or igniter tube. A fixed round had all the components integrated into a brass cartridge case with the projectile attached, e.g. a rifle cartridge or QF 18-pounder round, in which case Round is synonymous with cartridge. A separate round required the projectile and propellant cartridge (either in bags or brass case) to be loaded separately. RPC Remote power control: this is where a gun turret or a gun director automatically trains and elevates to follow the target being tracked by the DCT and the table (computer) in the transmitting station (see above). Mountings would also have local control in the event of the RPC or director tower being disabled. S.A.P. 4.7 inch naval gun, 1933 Semi armour-piercing: introduced after World War I as the successor to common pointed shells for naval use. They had a heavy solid nose and a medium amount of TNT explosive, giving them the capability to penetrate steel superstructures and a small thickness of armour. They were employed as the main shell for naval and coastal guns 8 inches and below in action against warships. Later shells were streamlined with the addition of a pointed ballistic cap, and were designated SAP/BC. In World War II they were typically painted olive green, with a red nose. S.B.C. Slow burning cocoa powder: a form of brown prismatic powder, i.e. gunpowder, with more charcoal, saltpetre and moisture but less sulphur than black powder. Cocoa referred to the appearance rather than composition. Used in the late 19th century for early large long-barreled guns, where its slow-burning properties gave the projectile a prolonged smooth acceleration instead of the short violent acceleration typical of black powder. This powder was inefficient because most energy was expended as smoke, and enormous quantities were required, such as 960 lb for the BL 16.25 inch gun of 1888. Required a primer of black powder to ignite. SBML Smooth bore muzzle loading denotes a barrel that is not rifled and where the projectile is loaded via the muzzle of the barrel. Most early cannons were of this type. British SBML guns of the mid-19th century were typically made of cast iron. The last cannon of this type in British service was the 68 pounder 95 cwt introduced in the 1840s. Modern weapons using this method of loading are light field mortars, in which the mortar bomb is dropped into the mortar barrel for firing; in these modern weapons the projectiles are spin-stabilised, but by fins rather than rifling. Segment shell RBL 12 pdr Armstrong gun Segment shells, also known as ring shells : this anti-personnel explosive shell originated in British service in 1859 as design by William Armstrong for use with his new breechloading field guns. The projectile was made up of layers of iron rings within a thin cast-iron shell wall, held together with lead between them, with a hollow space in the centre for the bursting charge of gunpowder. The rings broke up into segments on explosion. The explosive charge was typically about half that employed in an equivalent calibre common shell as less explosive was needed to separate and break up the rings than to burst the shell wall of a common shell, hence allowing more iron to be employed for the same weight of shell. It could be employed in the role of shrapnel, case or common shell. It was generally phased out in favour of common and shrapnel shells. Shellite An explosive mixture of picric acid and dinitrophenol or picric acid and hexanitrodiphenylamine in a ratio of 70/30. It was typically used as a filling in Royal Navy, armour-piercing shells after World War I. Known as Tridite in US service. Steel shell 6 pounder Hotchkiss steel shell rounds \\"Steel shell\\" was the British term for the Hotchkiss 3 and 6 pounder common pointed shells and some others such as the QF 1-pounder base-fuzed round. They had attributes of British common pointed shells as they were filled with gunpowder, had base percussion fuzes and a heavy pointed nose (almost three C.R.H.). But the nose was closer in design to British A.P. shells - the solid section was longer than common pointed, and the body held proportionately less powder than common pointed. It was intended for naval use. In common usage, \\"steel shell\\" served to differentiate a shell constructed of steel from one constructed of cast iron (C.I.). Table In the Royal Navy a table refers to a gunnery computer, such as the Dreyer Table, high angle control system table, or Admiralty Fire Control Table. The name probably originated with the Dreyer Table. Tube See vent-sealing tube. UD Upper deck : a naval gun mounting in which the rotating mass of the turret is mounted above the deck, with usually only the ammunition feed trunking piercing the deck. Velvril \\"Velvril paint\\" was used to line larger common shells in the early 20th century to prevent the gunpowder filling from coming into contact with the iron or steel shell wall. This was both to avoid the saltpetre from causing corrosion in the presence of any moisture, and also provided a smooth surface that prevented friction between the gunpowder and shell wall, hence reducing the risk of spontaneous ignition when the shell was fired. It was made up of 24 parts zinc oxide, 3.5 yellow ochre, 0.5 red iron oxide, 15 nitrated castor oil, 7.5 nitro-cellulose of very low nitration, 60 acetone oil. Vent-sealing tube QF 12 pounder 12 cwt cartridges with adapter for V.S. tube Mk VII percussion tube, standard for medium-heavy BL artillery in 1914 Usually abbreviated to \\"V.S. tube\\" or just tube. This was the traditional, reliable British method of fully igniting powder charges in BL guns to fire projectiles, especially large shells. Briefly, after the powder cartridge was loaded (or even during the loading process), the tube was inserted through a vent in the breech. Early vents were \\"radial\\" i.e. at right-angles to the barrel length, bored through the top of the barrel into the chamber; later vents were \\"axial\\" through the centre of the breech mechanism and \\"mushroom\\" into the chamber. When the breech was closed, one of several methods was then used to trigger the tube, which then sent a powerful flash into the breech. The flash ignited a special \\"igniter\\" material in the end of the cartridge, and the igniter in turn ignited the main propellant charge (some form of gunpowder or cordite). A powerful reliable flash from the tube was required because with bag charges, especially in the stress of combat or with variable howitzer charges, it could not be guaranteed that the igniter in the cartridge would be up close to the vent - it may have been pushed in too far, leaving a gap. The tube was designed to expand on ignition and seal the vent, preventing escape of gas. Tube types: *Percussion tube - the tube was inserted in an axial vent in the breech and triggered by a firing pin in a percussion lock in the breech. Single-use. Used with medium-heavy guns and howitzers, e.g. 60 pounder gun. *Electric tube - the tube was fired by an electric current from mains or battery. Considered safe, but cumbersome for field use. Common with naval and coast defence guns. T Friction tube Mk IV, 1914 *Friction tube - the tube would have a lanyard attached, with length proportional to the size of the gun, which when pulled caused friction inside the tube which ignited a powder charge, much like striking a match. Single-use. Originally of \\"copper\\" and \\"quill\\" types, replaced by the \\"T\\" tube by the late 1890s. They were used in great quantities by field artillery and are found on old British battlefields up to 1904, e.g. in South Africa. They were inserted in a \\"radial\\" vent on top of the breech, or later in axial vents running lengthwise through the centre of the breech such as with the BL 15 pounder. The T design, with the friction wire to which the lanyard was attached running through the crosspiece of the T, ensured that when the lanyard was pulled and the gun recoiled the wire was pulled smoothly out of the T piece without exerting force on the vertical part of the T and hence affecting the gas seal. From 1904, the new generation of field artillery was QF with propellant in brass cases with self-contained percussion primers, while small naval QF cases had self-contained electric primers. From then on, tubes were used only for guns of 60 pounder (5 inch) and upwards, usually percussion tubes; and for a few small BL guns such as the 2.75 inch mountain gun, usually friction tubes. However, Britain entered World War I with many old BLC 15 pounders which continued to require T tubes until phased out by 1916. To approach a QF rate of fire they used a special \\"push\\" version of the T friction tube which was inserted into an axial vent in the breech like a BL percussion tube and fired by a similar mechanism to a firing pin activated by a lever rather than being pulled by a lanyard. Tubes could also be used with QF cartridges fitted with tube adaptors in place of primers, as with the QF 12 pounder. Windage \\"Windage\\" as applied to British muzzle-loading ordnance referred to the difference between a gun's bore and the projectile's diameter, typically 0.1 - 0.2 inch. This gap was necessary to allow the projectile to be rammed down the length of the barrel on loading. The word windage was also used for the amount of propellant gas that escaped around the loosely fitting projectile on firing, and hence failed to contribute to accelerating the projectile. Up to half of the gas was lost in this way in old smoothbore artillery. From 1859, Armstrong rifled guns used a deformable lead coating on the projectile to minimise windage and simultaneously to engage the rifling. The elimination of windage necessitated a new design of timed fuze, because the burning propellant gas escaping past the head of the shell had been used to ignite the gunpowder timer train in the fuze in the shell nose. The new fuses used the shock of firing to ignite the timer. When Britain reverted to muzzle-loaders in the late 1860s, projectiles were rotated by studs protruding from the shell body engaging in deep rifling grooves in the barrel, but the windage caused excessive barrel wear. From 1878, after several years of unsuccessful trials, a fairly effective system of concave copper discs called gas-checks was introduced between the charge and projectile; they expanded on firing and sealed the bore. The gas-checks were soon incorporated into the projectile itself and became the driving bands still in use today. Wire-wound 6-inch Mk XII, a typical British wire-wound naval gun introduced in 1914. The wire layer is the dark area \\"Wire-wound\\" or simply \\"wire\\" guns were a gun construction method introduced for British naval guns in the 1890s, at which time the strength of large British steel forgings could not be guaranteed in sufficiently large masses to make an all-steel gun of only two or three built- up tubes. One or more central \\"A\\" tubes were tightly wound for part or the full length with layers of steel wire, and the wire was covered by a jacket. It was first used on the QF 6 inch Mk II (40 calibre) of 1892, and the first large calibre gun was the BL 12 inch Mk VIII (35 calibre) of 1895. It provided greater radial strength, i.e., it better withstood the gas pressure attempting to expand the gun's diameter, than previous \\"hoop\\" construction methods of similar weight. This was necessitated by the introduction of cordite as a propellant in 1892, which generated higher pressures along the length of the barrel than the gunpowder used before. However, it provided less axial strength, i.e. lengthwise rigidity, and early longer wire-wound guns suffered from droop and inaccuracy. A combination of wire and traditional methods was eventually adopted to solve this problem. The successful British wire naval guns of World War I were typically shorter than German and US guns of the same calibre, which did not use wire-wound construction, e.g. British 45 calibres in length, or only 42 calibres in the 15-inch gun, compared to 50 calibres in guns of other countries. The method was found satisfactory for use with field guns and howitzers which had much shorter barrels (as well as much smaller projectiles and much lower \\"chamber pressures\\") than naval guns. Britain abandoned wire-wound construction for naval guns after the 16 inch Mk I of the 1920s, and later 1930s - 1940s designs used monobloc (single-piece) (e.g. 12-pdr 12 cwt Mk V) or built-up all-steel construction (e.g. 6 inch Mk XXIII and 14 inch Mk VII).

The Pastoral Provision still provides a way for individuals to become priests in territorial dioceses, even though Anglicanorum Coetibus was declared which led to the establishment of Personal Ordinariates, another mechanism for former Anglicans to join the Catholic Church. The provision was authorized by Pope John Paul II in 1980 and announced in 1981, in response to requests from former United States Episcopalians and members of the Continuing Anglican movement. It allows diocesan bishops to establish personal parishes for former Anglicans, which use the liturgical forms of the Book of Divine Worship that keeps some elements of the Anglican liturgy. These forms of the Roman Rite are known as Anglican Use. The provision also enables bishops to ordain married former clergy as diocesan priests, when the Holy See grants a dispensation from the usual rule requiring Latin Rite Catholic priests to be celibate (i.e., unmarried). Since 1981, over 100 ordinations have taken place under the Pastoral Provision, and several personal parishes were established within dioceses. Starting in 2012, most of those parishes were transferred from their dioceses to a new nationwide jurisdiction, the Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter. In 2017 the Vatican ordered that all parishes within the Pastoral Provision enter into the North American Ordinariate. As of late 2017, only one chaplaincy in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston established under the Pastoral Provision remains in diocesan jurisdiction, after the parish in San Antonio was transferred to the Ordinariate. It is expected that the Boston congregation will eventually be transferred also. The Pastoral Provision remains in force for married former Anglican clergy petitioning for orders in any diocese that is not the Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of St. Peter. Origins In 1977, some of those who desired union with the Catholic Church contacted individual Catholic bishops, the Apostolic Delegate Archbishop Jean Jadot and the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in Rome, to inquire about the possibility for married Anglican priests to be received into the Catholic Church and function as Catholic priests. In 1979, after the United States National Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith had reacted favourably to the proposals that had been put before them, a formal request for union was presented in Rome on 3 November for acceptance into the Roman Catholic Church, for steps to be taken to eliminate any defects that might be found in their priestly orders, and that they be granted the oversight, direction, and governance of a Catholic bishop. The decision of the Holy See was officially communicated in a letter of 22 July 1980 from the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith to the President of the United States episcopal conference, who published it on 20 August 1980. Structure Though admittance of the Episcopalians in question to the Catholic Church was considered as reconciliation of individuals, a pastoral provision or statute gave them a common group identity.Letter of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , I That identity involved the possibility, after a period of being subject to the local Latin Church bishop, of being granted some distinct type of structure; the use, with the group, but not outside it, of a form of liturgy that retained certain elements of the Anglican liturgy; married Episcopalian priests may be ordained as Catholic priests, but not as bishops.Letter, II An Ecclesiastical Delegate, a Catholic who is preferably a bishop, was appointed to oversee the implementation of the decision and to coordinate with the Congregation.Letter, V Implementation In March 1981, the Vatican appointed then Most Rev. Bernard Francis Law, then Bishop of Springfield-Cape Girardeau and subsequently Archbishop of Boston, Cardinal, and Archpriest of the Basilica of St. Mary Major, as the Ecclesiastical Delegate. The Vatican subsequently appointed Most Rev. John J. Myers, Archbishop of Newark, to this post in 2003 and Most Rev. Kevin W. Vann, then Bishop of Fort Worth and now Bishop of Orange, to this post in 2011. Rev. William H. Stetson, a priest of the Personal Prelature Opus Dei, is Secretary to the Ecclesiastical Delegate. The Congregation for Divine Worship gave provisional approval for the group's liturgy, the Book of Divine Worship, in 1984, an approval rendered definitive in 1987. This book incorporates elements of the 1928 Book of Common Prayer, but the Eucharistic liturgy is from the 1979 Book, with the Eucharistic Prayers taken from the Roman Missal and the ancient Sarum Rite (with the modern English Words of Institution inserted in the latter). The number of personal parishes established is only 7, but, since 1983 over 80 former Anglicans have been ordained for priestly ministry in various Catholic dioceses of the United States. The Vatican erected the Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of St. Peter, a jurisdiction canonically equivalent to a diocese, for former Anglicans in the United States and Canada on 1 January 2012, and appointed then-Rev. Jeffrey N. Steenson, a married priest ordained under the pastoral provision who formerly had served as the Bishop of the Rio Grande in The Episcopal Church, as the first \\"ordinary\\" of this jurisdiction, subsequently naming him an apostolic protonotary (the highest rank of monsignor). The \\"ordinary\\" is canonically equivalent to a diocesan bishop, but receives episcopal ordination only if he is celibate. In 2015, the Vatican appointed then-Msgr. Steven Lopes, who was ordained as a bishop at his installation, as the second ordinary of this jurisdiction. Married priests Since at least the early 1950s, former Anglican, Lutheran and other clergy who join the Catholic Church have been granted exceptions to the norm of celibacy, in a practice mentioned in Pope Paul VI's encyclical Sacerdotalis caelibatus of 1967.Sacerdotalis caelibatus, 42-43 As of November 2012, approximately 70 married men have been ordained as priests under the Pastoral Provision. This number does not include married former Protestant clergy, whose petitions for dispensation from the norm of celibacy continue to go through the normal channels. The majority of married diocesan priests historically have not served as pastors of diocesan parishes, though there are now some exceptions. A few priests work at secular occupations to support their families, but the majority serve in chaplaincies and in teaching or administrative positions.

Upon realising Sonia and Martin are in a relationship, George blackmails Sonia and threatens to report Martin to the police unless she gives him ¬£10,000. Sonia steals the money from Dot's bank account. Creation Sonia as she looked in 1993 1994 was a \\"historic\\" year for EastEnders, as in April, a third weekly episode was introduced. Due to the programme's increased frequency, a number of new characters were introduced to the regular cast in the latter part of 1993 and early 1994. Among them were the Jackson family: mother Carol (Lindsey Coulson), her four children, Bianca (Patsy Palmer), Robbie (Dean Gaffney), Sonia (Natalie Cassidy), and Billie (Devon Anderson), as well as Carol's partner Alan Jackson (Howard Antony). Though Carol and Alan were not initially married in the serial, and though Alan was only the biological father of Billie, the whole family took on Alan's surname. The family was created by writer Tony McHale. Various members of the family began to appear sporadically from November 1993 onwards, but in episodes that aired early in 1994, the Jacksons moved from Walford Towers, a block of flats, to the soap's focal setting of Albert Square. Their slow introduction was a deliberate attempt by the programme makers to introduce the whole family over a long period. The Jacksons have been described by EastEnders scriptwriter Colin Brake as a \\"classic problem family\\". Cassidy was 10 years old when she joined the soap as Sonia. She was spotted doing improvisations at the Anna Scher Theatre School by Tony McHale and EastEnders' Casting Advisor Jane Deitch. They liked Cassidy and she was asked to audition at Elstree studios, after which she was offered the part. None of the actors cast as the Jackson family were matched for appearance or screen compatibility. Cassidy commented, \\"it was all decided without doing that. I don't think it particularly mattered that none of us Jackson kids looked like each other because all our characters had different dads!\\" Development Early on in the character's narrative, Sonia was given a trumpet to play, which she did badly, infuriating her family and neighbours. According to Cassidy, this was on the behest of Storyliner and future Executive Producer of EastEnders, John Yorke. Cassidy revealed that she took lessons to play the trumpet, but that when she began to play well, she was asked by the producers to pretend to play it badly as Sonia was supposed to be playing it badly. Other storylines included a period where Sonia was bullied by her friend Clare Bates (Gemma Bissix) after she fell in with the wrong crowd at school. Despite the bullying storyline, Cassidy said that she and Bissix were good friends during their time together on the soap. In 1997, the actress who played Sonia's mother Carol decided to quit EastEnders. It was at this stage that the producers made a decision to write the majority of the Jackson family out. Cassidy commented, \\"I thought I was out of a job [on EastEnders] forever!\\". Cassidy made several temporary returns on-screen months later to visit Clare or Bianca, but she was still uncertain about the future of her character: \\"I didn't come back to the show for about four months or so after [ I was written out in 1997]. And after Clare left the Square [in 1998] I was gone for another eight months. I just got on with school and all that\\". However, later in 1998 the producers asked Cassidy to return to the serial full-time, which she said she was \\"thrilled\\" about. =Departure (2007)= In April 2006, it was announced that Cassidy would take a break from EastEnders, saying \\"it's time to try new things. But it doesn't mean Sonia won't be back\\". A BBC spokesperson added, \\"Natalie is a valued member of the EastEnders cast and we wish her all the very best during her break from the show\\". Sonia departed on screen in February 2007, along with her former husband Martin, as his actor, James Alexandrou, also left the serial. Their departing storyline was the culmination of the death of Pauline Fowler, following actress Wendy Richard's high-profile resignation from the serial in 2006. In the storyline, Pauline dies in suspicious circumstances and Sonia is blamed for killing her, although Sonia is eventually vindicated when Pauline's husband Joe Macer (Ray Brooks) admits to manslaughter. Sonia and Martin and their daughter Rebecca leave Walford as a united family for the United States. In 2010, Cassidy said one of the reasons she decided to leave the show was because of Sonia's affair with Naomi Julien (Petra Letang), saying it was wrong for the character. Despite Cassidy's departure being specified as a \\"break\\", Cassidy commented in 2008, \\"I feel that door's closed now and I need to go and do other stuff [...] Maybe in nine years I might go back.\\" More recently, in 2009, press reports suggested that the actress was keen to reprise the role. Patsy Palmer, who returned to EastEnders as Sonia's sister Bianca, publicly called for the actress's return: \\"I would love her to come back. I mean, she is family! I've told bosses that it's a good time, when you think about it, as the Jacksons are back now as well.\\" =Guest stints (2010‚Äì2011)= On 25 October 2009 it was announced that Cassidy would return to the soap to reprise her role as Sonia, along with Coulson, Gaffney and Anderson. The characters would reunite with Bianca who returned in 2008. Cassidy is quoted as saying \\"To be invited back to EastEnders is such an honour and I am very, very excited that Sonia is coming back. For me, to be reunited with the original Jacksons is a dream come true and I think it will be a fantastic storyline.\\" A source told entertainment website Digital Spy: \\"Everything's being kept hush-hush about the Jacksons' return at the moment, but there are certainly a load of questions to be answered. Will the frosty relationship between Carol and Bianca thaw? Are Sonia and Martin still together? And how will Robbie react when he learns of his beloved Wellard's death? Everyone's so pleased to have them back.\\" The family returned for Bianca's second wedding to Ricky Butcher as part of the show's 25th anniversary. Executive producer Diederick Santer explained that he wanted great stories to get people talking, saying \\"The wedding is the perfect opportunity for us to bring back the much-loved Jackson characters ‚Äì Carol, Sonia, Robbie and Billie.\\" =Reintroduction (2014)= Sonia returned permanently on 14 January 2014. In February 2016, Cassidy announced she was expecting her second child, meaning she would be taking maternity leave. Cassidy confirmed the baby is due in \\"summer\\" 2016. It was expected that Cassidy would leave in spring 2016, with Sonia departing on- screen in summer 2016. Sonia departed on-screen on 20 September 2016. After returning for a short stint from 14 April 2017 to 18 April 2017, Cassidy returned to the role of Sonia permanently, with the return being broadcast on 27 June 2017. Reception Natalie Cassidy won the award for \\"Best Actress\\" for the role of Sonia, at the 2001 British Soap Awards. Additionally, in 2004, Cassidy was awarded \\"best dramatic performance by a young actor or actress\\" for the role. Referencing Sonia's foray into lesbianism in 2005, TV critic Grace Dent branded the character \\"the worst lesbian ever\\", adding, \\"The only lesbians with less lesbian tendencies than you are the women on the front cover of the Horny Triple-X Lesbian Specials which they keep at eye level by the sweets in my corner shop. Time to make a u-turn.\\" Lesbian website AfterEllen.com was also critical of the storyline that saw Sonia experimenting with her sexuality and then returning to her heterosexual orientation shortly after. Sharon Hadrian writes: \\"It was the first time in over a decade that a lesbian couple had been depicted in the East London drama, lending cautious optimism to the idea that the BBC was finally integrating its traditionally heterosexual soaps [...] Lesbian fans, meanwhile, are struggling to care at all after being led on by the show's failed attempts at writing a decent lesbian story line [...] Despite their troubles, Martin and Sonia got married in 2004 and ‚Äî given their past ‚Äî many fans believe they are meant to be together. If this seems like the most inopportune time to turn Sonia into a lesbian, well, the show's writers did it anyway [...] Sonia's sudden lesbian affair was met with disapproval from all sides, and nobody ‚Äî the fans, characters or even the actors ‚Äî was particularly supportive of her relationship. As a result, perhaps, the writers wrote what was expected of them [...] there was hardly room in the script for any affection or sympathy at all; instead, their relationship was written around its impact on Martin and the other Albert Square residents. The reaction of Rebecca's guardian, Margaret, was especially hurtful. When the [lesbian] relationship became public, she immediately sought to award sole custody of Rebecca to Martin, citing Sonia's sexual orientation as the reason she would be an unfit mother. This vitriolic response to Sonia and Naomi's relationship could have been a pivotal moment had the program's producers used the opportunity to prove either the quality of their relationship or to reinforce Sonia's parenting abilities. Unfortunately, they did neither of these things. Instead, Margaret's reaction was surprisingly representative of the public response to their relationship. Fans of the show were upset that anyone (let alone a lesbian) had come between Sonia and Martin. Naomi came off looking especially predatory ‚Äî a common trait in media representations of gay and lesbian characters ‚Äî by seducing a formerly heterosexual woman and convincing her to leave her family [...] not too surprisingly, Naomi and Sonia broke up. Afterward, Naomi faded into the background and Sonia ended up back with Martin, seeming to forget entirely about the same-sex attractions she once had [...] It was a sad but not unexpected ending to a rare chance for the BBC to acknowledge lesbian sexuality in its programming and for viewers to witness a positive lesbian relationship that didn't ruin anybody's life [...] Sonia or Naomi [...] had the potential to develop a loving depiction of lesbian sexuality but were failed by the show's writers and, arguably, the BBC's institutionalized homophobia\\".

Born in Saint-Jean-de-Luz Saint-Jean-de-Luz on 1 February, she was brought up by her rich aunts in a historical castle in the Basque country. After the end of the First World War, she went to study at Girton College, part of the University of Cambridge. In 1927, she sought psychoanalytical treatment from Sigmund Freud and upon recounting an anxiety dream to him Freud apparently concluded, correctly, that she had been an illegitimate child. Choisy was a critic of Andr√© Breton's Surrealist Manifesto saying that it was based on a misunderstanding of Freud's concept of the unconscious mind and as a response to the Surrealist Movement, she published her \\"Manifeste Surridealiste\\" in Les Nouvelles litt√©raires on 22 October 1927. It can also be found in her novel Mon Coeur dans une formule: C6 H8 (Az O3)6. After meeting Pierre Teilhard in 1938 she converted to Catholicism and began to connect science, religion and psychoanalysis in her work. Her role in the founding of the journal Psych√© (1946) reflected her concerns with the \\"ideals of the Roman Catholic church\\". She went back to receiving psychoanalysis from Ren√© Laforgue in this period. Her most controversial work was Un mois chez les filles which literally means 'A month among the girls' however when it was published in 1961 in English in the United States the titled changed to Psychoanalysis of the Prostitute. Choisy attempted to characterise sex workers as more human than in previous literature and avoided \\"moralising or...aestheticism\\". She received multiple awards in her lifetime including the National Order of Merit, a silver medal of Arts, Lettres, et Sciences, and the Lamennais Prize in 1967.

In contemporary usage, it may refer to the perceived imposition of an Islamist social and political system on a society with an indigenously different social and political background. The English synonyms, muslimization and arabization, in use since before 1940 (e.g., Waverly Illustrated Dictionary) convey a similar meaning. Muslimization has recently been used as a term coined to describe the overtly Muslim practices of new converts to the religion who wish to reinforce their newly acquired religious identity.Lindley-Highfield, M. (2008) '\\"Muslimization\\", Mission and Modernity in Morelos: the problem of a combined hotel and prayer hall for the Muslims of Mexico'. Tourism Culture & Communication, vol. 8, no. 2, 85‚Äì96. History=Arabization= Arabization describes a growing cultural influence on a non-Arab area that gradually changes into one that speaks Arabic and/or incorporates Arab culture. It was most prominently achieved during the 7th-century Arabian Muslim conquests which spread the Arabic language, culture and‚Äîhaving been carried out by Arabian Muslims as opposed to Arab Christians or Arabic-speaking Jews‚Äîthe religion of Islam to the lands they conquered. The result: some elements of Arabian origin combined in various forms and degrees with elements taken from conquered civilizations and ultimately denominated \\"Arab\\", as opposed to \\"Arabian\\". =Modern day (1970s‚Äìpresent)= Modern day Islamization appears to be a return of the individual to Muslim values, communities, and dress codes, and a strengthened community.Lapidus, p. 823 Another development is that of transnational Islam, elaborated upon by the French Islam researchers Gilles Kepel and Olivier Roy. It includes a feeling of a \\"growing universalistic Islamic identity\\" as often shared by Muslim immigrants and their children who live in non-Muslim countries: > The increased integration of world societies as a result of enhanced > communications, media, travel, and migration makes meaningful the concept of > a single Islam practiced everywhere in similar ways, and an Islam which > transcends national and ethnic customs.Lapidus, p. 828‚Äì30 This does not necessarily imply political or social organizations: > Global Muslim identity does not necessarily or even usually imply organized > group action. Even though Muslims recognize a global affiliation, the real > heart of Muslim religious life remains outside politics‚Äîin local > associations for worship, discussion, mutual aid, education, charity, and > other communal activities. A third development is the growth and elaboration of transnational military organizations. The 1980s and 90s, with several major conflicts in the Middle East, including the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict, Afghanistan in the 1980s and 2001, and the three Gulf Wars (1980‚Äì88, 1990‚Äì91, 2003‚Äì2011) were catalysts of a growing internationalization of local conflicts. Figures such as Osama bin Laden and Abdallah Azzam have been crucial in these developments, as much as domestic and world politics. Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization of Pakistan On December 2, 1978, General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq delivered a nationwide address on the occasion of the first day of the Hijra calendar. He did this in order to usher in an Islamic system to Pakistan. In the speech, he accused politicians of exploiting the name of Islam, saying that \\"many a ruler did what they pleased in the name of Islam.\\" After assuming power the task that the government set to was its public commitment to enforce Nizam-e-Mustafa (Islamic System) a 180 degree turn from Pakistan's predominantly Common Law. As a preliminary measure to establish an Islamic society in Pakistan, General Zia announced the establishment of Sharia Benches. Speaking about the jurisdiction of the Sharia Benches, he remarked, \\"Every citizen will have the right to present any law enforced by the government before the 'Sharia Bench' and obtain its verdict whether the law is wholly or partly Islamic or un- Islamic.\\" But General Zia did not mention that the Sharia Benches' jurisdiction was curtailed by the following overriding clause: \\"(Any) law does not include the constitution, Muslim personal law, any law relating to the procedure of any court or tribunal or, until the expiration of three years, any fiscal law or any law relating to the collection of taxes and fees or insurance practice and procedure.\\" It meant that all important laws which affect each and every individual directly remained outside the purview of the Sharia Benches. However, he did not have a smooth sailing even with the clipped Sharia Benches. The Federal Sharia Bench declared rajm or stoning, to be un-Islamic; Ziaul Haq reconstituted the court, which then declared rajm as Islamic.

Volcanic in origin, Saint Paul features a number of cinder cones and volcanic craters in its interior. The highest of these, Rush Hill, rises to on the island's western shore, though most of the upland areas average less than in elevation. Most of the island is a low-lying mix of rocky plateaus and valleys, with some of the valleys holding freshwater ponds. Much of its of shoreline is rugged and rocky, rising to sheer cliffs at several headlands, though long sandy beaches backed by shifting sand dunes flank a number of shallow bays. Like the other Pribilof Islands, Saint Paul rises from a basaltic base. Its hills are primarily brown or red tufa and cinder heaps, though some (like Polavina) are composed of red scoria and breccia. The island sits on the southern edge of the Bering-Chukchi platform, and may have been part of the Bering Land Bridge's southern coastline when the last ice age's glaciers reached their maximum expansion. Sediment core samples taken on Saint Paul show that tundra vegetation similar to that found on the island today has been present for at least 9,000 years. The thick rough turf is dominated by umbellifers (particularly Angelica) and Artemisia, though grasses and sedges are also abundant. alt=Smooth, rounded hills and flatlands covered in golden-brown vegetation lie beyond a lake under heavy cloud. History Saint Paul and environs, circa 1890 The Aleut peoples knew of the Pribilofs long before westerners discovered the islands. They called the islands Amiq, Aleut for \\"land of mother's brother\\" or \\"related land\\". According to their oral tradition, the son of an Unimak Island elder found them after paddling north in his boat in an attempt to survive a storm that caught him out at sea; when the winds finally died, he was lost in dense fog‚Äîuntil he heard the sounds of Saint Paul's vast seal colonies.Borneman 2003, pp. 113‚Äì114Elliott 1886, pp. 193‚Äì194 Russian fur traders were the first non-natives to discover Saint Paul. The island was discovered by Gavriil Pribylov on St. Peter and St. Paul's Day, July 12, 1788. Three years later the Russian merchant vessel John the Baptist was shipwrecked off the shore. The crew were listed as missing until 1793, when the survivors were rescued by Gerasim Izmailov. In the 18th century, Russians forced Aleuts from the Aleutian chain (several hundred miles south of the Pribilofs) to hunt seal for them on the Pribilof Islands. Before this the Pribilofs were regularly inhabited by the Aleuts. The Aleuts were essentially slave labor for the Russians‚Äîhunting, cleaning, and preparing fur seal skins, which the Russians sold for a great deal of money. The Aleuts were not taken back to their home islands; they lived in inhumane conditions, they were beaten, and they were regulated by the Russians down to what they could eat and wear and whom they could marry. Saints Peter and Paul Church, a Russian Orthodox church, was built on the island in 1907. Climate Rock sandpiper Saint Paul's climate is strongly influenced by the cold waters of the surrounding Bering Sea, and is classified as polar (K√∂ppen ET) due to the raw chilliness of the summers. It experiences a relatively narrow range of temperatures, high wind, humidity and cloudiness levels, and persistent summer fog. There is high seasonal lag: February is the island's coldest month, while August is its warmest; the difference between the average low temperature in February and the average high temperature in August is only . Although the mean average temperature for the year is above freezing, at , the monthly daily average temperature remains below freezing from December to April. Low temperatures at or below occur an average of 4.7 nights per year (mostly from January to March), and the island is part of USDA Hardiness Zone 6. Extreme temperatures have ranged from on March 14, 1971, up to on August 14, 2020 and August 25, 1987. Winds are strong and persistent year-round, averaging around . They are strongest from late autumn through winter, when they increase to an average of nearly , blowing mostly from the north. In the summer, they become weaker and blow primarily from the south. The island's humidity level, which averages more than 80 percent year round, is highest during the summer. Cloud cover levels peak during the summer as well. Although high year-round, with an average of 88 percent, cloud cover levels rise to 95 percent in the summer. Fog too is more common in the summer, occurring on roughly one-third of the days. The island receives about of precipitation per year, with the highest monthly totals occurring between late summer and early winter, when Bering Sea storms batter the island. Snowfall levels are highest between December and March, averaging per year. Other than trace amounts, the period from June to September is generally snow-free. High winds and relatively warm temperatures combine to keep snow levels low, resulting in monthly mean snow depths of less than . Hours of daylight range from a low of 6.5 hours in midwinter to a high of 18 hours in midsummer. Natural history St. Paul Island, sand dune habitat Pribilof Islands Saint Paul Island, like all of the Pribilof Islands, is part of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge. Its seabird cliffs were purchased in 1982 for inclusion in the refuge. The island has also been designated as an Important Bird Area. It is the breeding grounds for more than 500,000 northern fur seals and millions of seabirds, and is surrounded by one of the world's richest fishing grounds. Woolly mammoths survived on Saint Paul Island until around 3,750 BC, which is the most recent survival of North American mammoth populations.Kristine J. Crossen, \\"5,700-Year-Old Mammoth Remains from the Pribilof Islands, Alaska: Last Outpost of North America Megafauna\\", Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs, Volume 37, Number 7, (Geological Society of America, 2005), 463.David R.

A mass die-off of puffins at St. Paul Island between October 2016 and January 2017 has been attributed to ecosystem changes resulting from global warming. Population Sts.

The Staats Model School is situated on the corner of Lilian Ngoyi (previously Van der Walt) and Nana Sita (previously Skinner) Streets in Pretoria, Gauteng Province, Republic of South Africa. It originated from a school established in 1893 to train teachers in the Zuid Afrikaansche Republik, or ZAR. Alfred Fernandez Harington was appointed English master on 1 October 1895. Sytze Wierda, chief architect of the ZAR, designed the building in 1895, and its construction was completed by Te Groen in 1896. The structure consists of brick and Stinkwater sandstone and adheres to the Neo Dutch Renaissance school of architecture. On 11 October 1899 the school closed its doors as a result of the outbreak of the Anglo-Boer War. During the war the building functioned as a hospital for Boer soldiers and as a prison for British officers. The escape of Winston Churchill, war correspondent and later British prime minister, from the building has become legend. The school regained some life from 1901 as Pretoria High School, and from 1902 to 1909 as the Pretoria College for Boys, which later became Pretoria Boys High School. In 1910 the college moved to larger premises and the Staats Model School building housed several other schools after that, including, in 1946, the ‚ÄòHamilton Primary School‚Äô (Robert Hamilton was a well- known businessman and benefactor of the school). The Library Services of the Transvaal Education Department, or TED, moved in during 1951. The building was declared a national monument on 8 April 1960.

She first appeared in the Superman comic strip and was created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. Lara is the biological mother of Superman, and the wife of scientist Jor-El. Lara Lor-Van is Lara's full maiden name, as \\"Lor-Van\\" is the name of Lara's father.Superman (vol. 1) #233, January 1971Superman Family #192, November‚ÄìDecember 1978 Most depictions of Kryptonian culture show that Kryptonian women use their father's full name as their last names before marriage. After marriage, they usually are known simply by their first names, though various versions show they use their husband's full name or last name as their married last name.Superman (vol. 1) #141, November 1960World of Krypton #1, July 1979 Lara's role in the Superman mythos has varied over the years, with her treatment and emphasis often depending on the decade she was written in. Golden Age and early Silver Age stories treated Lara in a lesser role compared to her husband. However, stories from the 1970s onwards depict Lara in more prominent roles; one such example is the 2004 miniseries Superman: Birthright. After constructing his Fortress of Solitude, Superman honored his deceased biological parents with a statue of Jor-El and Lara holding up a globe of their native planet Krypton.Action Comics #395, December 1970, et al.  Golden and Silver Age versions  Lara, Jor-El, and Superman. From the cover of Superman (volume 1) #141 (November 1960). Art by Curt Swan. Lara first appeared in the Superman newspaper comic strip in 1939, where she was first named \\"Lora.\\" Her first comic book appearance (after being mentioned in the 1942 text novel The Adventures of Superman by George Lowther, where she was named \\"Lara\\" for the first time) was in More Fun Comics #101 in January‚ÄìFebruary 1945. A 1948 retelling of Superman's origin storySuperman (vol. 1) #53, July‚ÄìAugust 1948 subsequently delved into detail about Lara, though her more familiar Silver Age aspects became more firmly established starting in the late 1950s and over the course of the next several decades. After the establishment of DC's multiverse in the early 1960s, the Golden Age version of Superman's mother was stated as having been named \\"Lora\\", and lived on the Krypton of the Earth-Two universe.Superman Family #202, July 1980Secret Origins (vol. 1) #1, April 1986 The Silver Age Lara, meanwhile, lived on the Krypton of the Earth-One universe. A definitive synopsis of the Silver Age Lara's life (summarizing the various stories revealing her history) came in the 1979 miniseries The World of Krypton (not to be confused with the post-Crisis on Infinite Earths late 1980s comic special of the same name). As summarized in The World of Krypton (and in various other stories), Lara was a promising astronaut in Krypton's space program. However, Krypton's space program was soon permanently grounded after Jax-Ur blew up one of Krypton's inhabited moons.Adventure Comics #289, October 1961 Eventually, Lara met scientist Jor-El, with the two having several adventures together before getting married, such as a time-traveling Lois Lane attempting to seduce Jor-El after failing to marry their son in the future. Some time later, Lara gave birth to the couple's only child, Kal-El. Early in Jor-El and Lara's marriage, the couple are briefly watched by the Guardians of the Universe, who note that Lara (or her husband) would have made an excellent Green Lantern.Superman (vol. 1) #257, October 1972 Lara and her husband Jor-El were shown to be practitioners of the Kryptonian martial art of \\"klurkor\\".The New Adventures of Superboy #28, April 1982 When Krypton was about to explode, Lara and Jor-El placed their infant son into an escape rocket built by Jor-El. In most retellings, Jor-El wanted Lara to accompany their son to Earth, but Lara refused, saying their son would have a better chance of reaching Earth without her extra weight.The World of Krypton #3, September 1979 Kal-El's spaceship then took off, leaving Lara and Jor-El to perish.  Modern Age versions  After the 1985-1986 miniseries Crisis on Infinite Earths and John Byrne's 1986 miniseries The Man of Steel rewrote Superman's origins, details about Lara's background and character were changed. Under Byrne's version, Lara inhabited a cold, emotionally sterile Krypton where even bodily contact was forbidden. Lara's grandmother, Lady Nara, and Seyg-El, Jor-El's father, were the ones who arranged the union between them - so that they might have a child who would fill an opening in the planet's Register of Citizens when another Kryptonian died a rare and untimely death. Jor-El, however, was considered a \\"throwback\\" for actually expressing emotions toward his wife Lara, and for his favoring the less sterilized days of past Kryptonian eras. In this version of the mythos, Lara was a librarian and historian of high rank and thought it horrifying that Kal- El would be sent to a \\"primitive\\" planet such as Earth. In one story, the adult Kal (now Superman) is transported to the past and encounters his parents moments before Krypton's destruction. Lara is disgusted by what she sees and tells Kal not to approach her, finding him \\"repellent\\", even as she is ashamed of her feelings. In the 2004 Superman miniseries Superman: Birthright, Lara, along with Krypton and Jor-El, more or less again became their Silver Age versions, though with updated touches. In this version, Lara is treated as a fully equal partner to Jor-El in constructing Kal-El's spacecraft and in designing various key components. In the 2009 series Superman: Secret Origin by Geoff Johns, Superman is first introduced to his birth mother in his teens by the spaceship that brought him to the Earth as a baby. She is introduced to Kal-El by a hologram of Jor-El as his mother. This moment shocks Superman and brings tears to Martha Kent's eyes. Also in 2009, Lara's own family background is described. Lara Lor-Van is born into the Labor Guild, whose members are not physically abused but have no say in the choices of their lives and who, unlike the members of other guilds, cannot change guilds. Lara became a member of her husband's Science Guild when she married him and was thereby granted all the freedoms granted to other Science Guild members. A member of Krypton's Military Guild describes this as being \\"raised up.\\"  The New 52  In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Lara is a member of Krypton's military forces. One of the most talented students on the Military Academy, Lara is both a skilled fighter and a bright scientist. Lara appears in the \\"Krypton Returns\\" storyline. She gives her maiden name as \\"Lara Van-El.\\"Action Comics Annual (vol. 2) #2, December 2013 Other versions *In Art Baltazar's Superman Family Adventures, Lara survived Krypton's destruction by escaping into the Phantom Zone. She is eventually freed by her son and accepted into the Superman family. Though Jor- El didn't make it out, Superman uses a specific crystal that allows him to resurrect Jor-El for 24 hours that would allow the two to spend more time with each other. When the family tries to stop Brainiac, the villain stops his assault and moves Kandor when he discovers that Lara is pregnant, telling the group that their family isn't complete yet.Superman: Family Adventures Lara gives birth in Baltazar's Super Powers book, where her time in the Phantom Zone has altered the baby's DNA to look like Brainiac.Super Powers *In the Elseworlds series Superman: The Last Family of Krypton, Jor-El was able to save himself and Lara and accompany Kal-El to Earth, where Jor-El sets up the corporation JorCorp while Lara establishes the self-help movement 'Raology'. More open to adapting on Earth, she arranges for Kal-El to be discreetly adopted by the Kents so that he can live a more normal life, and later has twin children, Bru-El and Valora, whose 'stunted' genetics due to their birth on Earth mean that they only possess half of the superhuman potential of their brother. While attending a dinner in Gotham, Lara is able to save Thomas and Martha Wayne when she intercepts Joe Chill's attempted mugging, thus unknowingly preventing the creation of Batman, Jor-El's own actions further hindering the opportunity for mankind to develop its own heroes in the belief that his family are enough. Lara eventually rejects Jor-El's desire to 'micromanage' humanity out of fear of Earth being destroyed as Krypton was, relocating to her own estate of 'Lara-Land', where she uses red sun emitters to restrict her natural abilities and simply encourages spiritual growth while using Kryptonian technology to heal injuries. However, the manipulation of Lex Luthor allows him to turn her son, Bru-El, into a kryptonite-powered superhuman who nearly kills Jor-El before Lara takes the blast herself, this attack also infecting her with a secret virus that kills her after a few days of exposure. * In Superman Adventures (based on the animated series), the story arc \\"Family Reunion\\" sees Superman accidentally travel to a parallel universe where a single Kryptonian city survived Krypton's destruction, with its natives including Jor-El and Lara. However, after spending years drifting in space, Lara has become bitter and egotistical, abducting the 'local' Superman and Supergirl and brainiwashing them into being dedicated Kryptonian soldiers to the point that they are willing to conquer Earth and enslave humanity to ensure Krypton's survival. When the 'prime' Superman arrives in this world, he joins forces with Jor-El to force the Kryptonian forces back to the city, at which point Jor-El reveals that he intends to destroy the city so that the resulting explosion will send Superman home. When Lara asks if he is really willing to destroy the remaining few hundred Kryptonians to save all of Earth, Jor-El grimly observes that she has just answered her own question and triggers the self-destruct.Superman Adventures #30-#31 In other media Lara has appeared (usually briefly) in various media adaptations of the Superman story. However, as was the case in the older comics, Lara usually has a less prominent role than Jor-El in such depictions. =Radio= Agnes Moorehead portrayed Lara in the debut episode of the radio serial The Adventures of Superman on February 12, 1940. She reprised the role in a few later episodes.Tranberg, p. 403 =Television= * In 1952, Lara was portrayed by Aline Towne in \\"Superman on Earth\\", the premiere episode of Adventures of Superman. * In the Super Friends episode called \\"The Planet Splitter\\", she was featured in a flashback. * Lara was also in the Challenge of the Super Friends episode \\"Secret Origins of the Super Friends\\". * Lara makes a non-speaking appearance in the episode Foundling in a flashback of Superman's past in Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman where she is portrayed by Eliza Roberts. Lara and her husband, Jor-El, in the first episode of Bruce Timm's Superman: The Animated Series * In 1996, Lara's voice was provided by Finola Hughes in \\"The Last Son of Krypton\\", the premiere episode of Superman: The Animated Series. She is depicted with elements of her Silver Age and Modern Age selves, where she is headstrong and an equal partner to Jor-El, but instead of being a scientist she is an artist. She also sports the forehead hair curl that has become a characteristic trait of Superman's physical appearance. * The Silver Age versions of Jor-El and Lara appear in the Pinky and the Brain episode \\"Two Mice and a Baby\\" as they place an infant Kal-El in his ship as Krypton crumbles. * Lara made a cameo with Jor-El in the Justice League episode \\"Twilight\\". * Lara has appeared in one episode of Season 3 in Smallville, played by Kendall Cross. Clark was dipped in a tank of kryptonite enhanced liquid used to induce repressed memories to come to surface. His mother placed baby Kal-El into the rocket which will take him to Earth. While Jor-El was more concerned about his son fulfilling his destiny, Lara was worried no one would love him. Clark came out of his fugue screaming her name, leaving him with the reassurance that his mother had loved him (as opposed to Jor-El's apparently heartless manipulation of him, although his intentions were later confirmed to be benevolent), Martha Kent subsequently telling him \\"Lara\\" was his first word, but she and Jonathan never knew what it meant. In the episode named \\"Lara\\" of season 7, it is revealed that Lara, now played by Supergirl actress Helen Slater, visited the Kent farm prior to the destruction of Krypton. Along with Kara, they hide a photograph of Lara so that Kal-El will find it. It is also noted in this episode that Lara's DNA was hidden in the blue crystal by her brother-in-law Zor-El. Pictures of Lara from this episode can be found here. In the episode \\"Blue\\" Lara and Zor-El are released onto Earth in corporeal form (although technically not alive). The story culminates in Clark's destruction of the crystal to rid the world of Zor-El. Although upset to again lose his mother, with her assurance that she loves him, he is able to in order to save Kara's life. The naming conventions in Smallville seem to differ from the comic book continuity. Kara refers to Lara as Lara-El at the start of the episode of \\"Blue.\\" This means that females, on Smallville, take their husband's last name and attach to their first. In the 10th-season episode \\"Abandoned!\\", she appears alongside Julian Sands as Jor- El, appearing in the form of a holographic message that Jor-El and Lara had recorded for Kal-El shortly before his ship was launched. After Lois travels to the Fortress to confront Jor-El about his failures as a father, the message featuring Jor-El and Lara assures their son that they have faith in him. * Ana Franchesca Rousseau portrays Lara in the pilot episode of Supergirl.Lara, Superman's Mom In Pilot She and Jor-El are seen in flashback as scientists who sent Kal-El to Earth before Krypton's destruction. An ice sculpture of her appears in Fortress of Solitude during the episodes \\"Solitude\\" and \\"Mr. & Mrs. Mxyzptlk.\\" =Films= * Lara is portrayed by Luana Walters in \\"Superman Comes to Earth\\", the first chapter of the 1948 Superman movie serial. Portions of this depiction appear in flashback as Lex Luthor recounts the story of Krypton's destruction in \\"At the Mercy of Atom Man!\\", the seventh chapter of the 1950 serial Atom Man vs. Superman. * Lara was played by Susannah York in Superman (1978), Superman II (1980) and Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987) (voice only). After Jor-El (Marlon Brando) was removed from Superman II, Lara took on the role as Superman's mentor, in both Superman II and IV. She was later replaced by Brando's Jor-El in Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut, the 2006 edit of Superman II. * In 2011's direct-to-video animated film All-Star Superman, Lara and her husband Jor-El appear briefly in a flashback during the moment they sent their infant son Kal-El to Earth to survive Krypton's destruction. Also, a large statue of Lara and one of Jor-El are kept by Superman in his Fortress of Solitude. * Ayelet Zurer portrays Lara in the 2013 film Man of Steel. Julia Ormond had previously been announced as cast, but dropped out. Connie Nielsen was in negotiations for the role before Ormond was cast. In this version, she is hesitant about sending her only child away to a primitive world, fearing they will kill him. Even after her husband assures her that is impossible, she worries that the craft won't make it. When Zod confronts Jor-El about stealing the codex and learns of the Els' natural- born son (which is against Kryptonian Law as all children are genetically- engineered to be more efficient), he fights Jor-El while Lara punches in the launch coordinates to her son's ship and sends him to earth despite Zod's pending to Save Krypton she decides to save her son's life. She runs to her husband's side after he is killed by Zod. She attends the sentencing of Zod and his rebels into the Phantom Zone where she gives Zod a stoic and cold look even after he cryptically warns her that he will find her son. After placing her husband's corpse into a burial chamber, she watches as Krypton is destroyed. Before she dies with the rest of her people, her last words to her son were \\"Make a better world than ours Kal.\\" * An alternate universe version of Lara appears in Justice League: Gods and Monsters voiced by Lauren Tom. =Video games= * The Man of Steel version of Lara appears as a playable character in Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham. * Lara makes an appearance in the opening for the story mode from Injustice 2. =Parodies= * Lara appeared in the Robot Chicken episode \\"Especially the Animal Keith Crofford\\" voiced by Vanessa Hudgens. * Lara and Jor-El make a cameo appearance in the animated adaptation of Dilbert, at the end of the episode ‚ÄúPregnancy‚Äù (in which Dilbert is accidentally impregnated by his own rocket). To save his child from the masses who wish to use it for their own gain, Dilbert puts the child on a rocket ship and sends him into space with Dogbert programming the ship to go to Krypton (which did not explode as Jor-El had predicted), specifically to the El family home.

Butter cake is baked with basic ingredients: butter, sugar, eggs, flour, and leavening agents such as baking powder or baking soda. It is considered as one of the quintessential cakes in American baking. Butter cake originated from the English pound cake, which traditionally used equal amounts of butter, flour, sugar, and eggs to bake a heavy, rich cake. History The invention of baking powder and other chemical leavening agents during the 19th century substantially increased the flexibility of this traditional pound cake by introducing the possibility of creating lighter, fluffier cakes using these traditional combinations of ingredients, and it is this transformation that brought about the modern butter cake. Ingredients and technique Butter cakes are traditionally made using a creaming method, in which the butter and sugar are first beaten until fluffy to incorporate air into the butter. Eggs are then added gradually, creating an emulsion, followed by alternating portions of wet and dry ingredients. Butter cakes are typically rich and moist when stored at room temperature, but they tend to stiffen, dry out, and lose flavor when refrigerated, making them unsuitable for filling or frosting in advance with ingredients that must be refrigerated, such as cream cheese frosting and pastry cream.

The antecedent of the current school is the historic Staats Model School, built 1896-1897 by the government of the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek (later Transvaal) in central Pretoria. Alfred Fern√°ndez Harington was appointed English master on 1 October 1895. The school was not in operation for very long owing to the outbreak of the Second Boer War in 1899. At the time, the building served as a prison, where notably Winston Churchill was briefly imprisoned.The Churchill Centre: The school was part of the whites- only education system, until the abolition of apartheid. = Pretoria High School (19011903) = With Pretoria under British control, it became apparent to Lord Milner, the Colonial Secretary at the time, that the educational facilities in the city needed attention as there was no secondary school for English-speaking pupils. The Staats Model School was duly refurbished. It was renamed Pretoria High School and became the first of the so-called Milner schools in the Transvaal, opening on 3 June 1901 with Charles Hope - who also founded Potchefstroom Boys High as headmaster. Initial enrolment was 32 pupils, both boys and girls, which increased to 132 by August of that year. Mr Hope left 15 months later, along with the girls, who were finally accommodated into the old building of the former Transvaal Republic's Staatsmeischjeskool (State Girls' School), which was renamed Pretoria High School for Girls. = Pretoria College (1903-1909) = Under the new headmaster, Harold Atkinson, enrolment increased to 100 boys by 1903. The name of the school was also changed to Pretoria College. Mr Atkinson left at the end of 1905 and was succeeded by J F Acheson who stayed with the school until it moved from Skinner Street to its current site in 1909. Formal devolution between primary and high school pupils only occurred in 1905. = The new buildings and bilingualism (1910-1920) = Milner's intention was to create a stable educational infrastructure in the new colony's capital and duly set aside of ground to the south-east of central Pretoria for the construction of new academic institutions. The southernmost , which included the Waterkloof Kop (English: Waterkloof Hill), was chosen as the new site for Pretoria Boys High School. The architect, Patrick Eagle, met the challenge by designing an edifice rivalling its larger contemporary, Sir Herbert Baker's Union Buildings. Eagle chose to site the main buildings on the ridge of the hill giving the school its well-known dramatic setting. The new school buildings were officially opened in 1909 by General Smuts, then colonial secretary of the Transvaal. The main building of the school, sited on Waterkloof Hill, is at present close to University of Pretoria, sitting opposite to the distant Union Buildings on Meintjieskop. One year later, the four colonies of the Transvaal, Orange Free State, Natal and the Cape formed the Union of South Africa. Keen to forge unity between English and Dutch (Afrikaner) South Africans, Smuts' influence was evident when, on 6 April 1910, the school absorbed 100 boys and staff from the Dutch-medium Eendracht High School to form a dual-medium high school. The combined school was now named Pretoria High School for Boys - Pretoria Hogere school voor Jongens. Smuts would later send his own sons to the school. = Devolution and re-establishment (1920) = The dual-medium institution would last ten years. By 1920, the divide between English and Afrikaans speakers had become apparent nationwide; this was reflected in the need for a separate Afrikaans high school in Pretoria. Consequently, the Afrikaanse Ho√´r Seunskool was formed immediately south of its parent, becoming the first Afrikaans-medium high school in the country, several years before Afrikaans attained official recognition as a language (and not a semi-Creole of Dutch). The two schools enjoy close ties to this day, especially in an enthusiastic but friendly rivalry in sporting events. PBHS would now be left in its present form, known as Pretoria Boys High School, an English-medium public school. = Headmasters since 1909 = * William Hofmeyr (19091935) * Daniel Matheson (19361949) * Noel Pollock (19501955) * Desmond Abernethy (19561973) * Malcolm Armstrong (19741989) * William E.

Main school building of Pretoria Boys High School, dating from 1909. = Heraldry = According to Illsley, each component of the badge has a special meaning relating to the history and spirit of the school. The shield component of the badge is divided into four quadrants, with the book representing learning, the tools the wealth of the Transvaal through gold mining, the tree growth and the ox wagon the Transvaal. The background colours of the four quadrants were the colours of the first four houses when given permanent names, i.e. Town red, Solomon gold, Sunnyside black and Rissik green. = The school songs = The official school song, Tis Here We Learn To Live, was written in the 1930s by two Old Boys. The composer of the music, Dr George Findlay, was a prominent Pretoria dermatologist. However, the school later adopted Forty Years On, originally the school song of Harrow School in London. It is this song that is sung at all school valedictions. The official school song was relegated to obscurity until it was revived as the school's rugby anthem.  Culture and activities = Cultural activities = Cultural activities include a well-established musical tradition, as well as a plethora of clubs and societies. These include Photography, Fantasy and Historical War Games, Aeronautical, Film, Wildlife, Drama, Debating, Chess, Public Speaking, Creative Writing and Science clubs. The school newspaper \\"Boys Highlights\\" is published and distributed each term. The school's Music Centre is regarded as one of the best in the country. The following ensembles frequently perform at school functions and external events: *Symphony Orchestra *Big Band *Dixie Band *String Quartet *Brass Choir *Clarinet Ensemble *Saxophone Ensemble *The Salon Boys *\\"Boere Orkes\\" *Pipe Band *Choir *Vocal Ensemble = Athletics and leisure = Sporting facilities include soccer, rugby union, cricket, Olympic standard athletics grounds, tennis, squash and basketball courts, a gymnasium, hockey fields, two swimming pools including one for waterpolo, an AstroTurf and a rock-climbing wall. There is also a man-made pine forest, an old shooting range which has been converted for the purpose of archery, an amphitheatre and an artificial lake, Loch Armstrong. The grounds form a protected bird sanctuary and are home to several different species of birds, fish, amphibians and reptiles. =Sports= Pretoria Boys High School performs well in sports throughout the year. The sports that is played at the school are: * Archery * Athletics * Basketball * Canoeing * Chess * Cricket * Cross country * Cycling * Fencing * Golf * Hockey * * Rugby * Football (soccer)  Squash * Swimming * Table tennis * Tennis * Water polo  School buildings  The new school buildings were officially opened in 1909 by General Smuts, then colonial secretary of the Transvaal. The main building of the school, sited on Waterkloof Hill, is at present close to University of Pretoria, sitting opposite to the distant Union Buildings on Meintjieskop. = Houses = Pretoria Boys High School is made up of ten constituent houses, each with its own unique culture and identity. House assemblies are held weekly, and house prefects are appointed annually. Annual inter-house sports meetings take place in which every pupil is strongly encouraged to participate. The inter- house swim meet (gala) is the most popular and well-attended of sport meetings. = Boarding houses = * Solomon * Rissik * School = Day-boy houses = * Abernethy * Arcadia * Armstrong * Hofmeyr * Matheson * Sunnyside * Town  The Old Boys Association  Pretoria Boys High School has a network of Old Boys, forming one of the largest alumni organisations in South Africa. Pretoria Boys High School Old Boys Association publishes an annual journal and review, The Phobian, which is distributed to Old Boys across the globe. Members of the association meet annually at the school for the annual dinner, and regular reunions of each matriculating group are organised 10, 20, 30 and 40 years on, echoing the refrain of the school song, Forty Years On.  Notable alumni  Professor Max Theiler (1899‚Äì1972), 1951 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine laureate, for developing a vaccine against yellow fever Professor Michael Levitt (1947-), 2013 Nobel Prize in Chemistry laureate The Honourable Edwin Cameron (1953-), judge of the Constitutional Court of South Africa Elon Musk (1971-), business magnate and founder of SpaceX and a co- founder of Zip2, PayPal, and Tesla Motors The school has produced two Nobel Prize laureates, eighteen Rhodes scholars, eight Supreme Court judges, an archbishop, two English Premier League football players, seven national cricketers and four Springbok rugby players  Notes and references  *  External links  * *Old Boys website Category:Boys' schools in South Africa Category:Schools in Pretoria Category:Boarding schools in South Africa Category:Educational institutions established in 1901 Category:History of Pretoria ","title":"Pretoria Boys High School"},{"id":"2293857","text":"Platform () is a 2001 novel by French writer Michel Houellebecq (translated into English by Frank Wynne). It has received both great praise and great criticism, most notably for the novel's apparent condoning of sex tourism and Islamophobia. After describing Islam as \\"the most stupid religion\\" in a published interview about the book, Houellebecq was charged for inciting racial and religious hatred but the charges were ultimately dismissed, as it has been ruled that the right to free speech encompasses the right to criticize religions. The novel and its author have been deemed \\"prophetic\\" or \\"prescient\\", as the last part depicts an Islamic terrorist attack which bears strong similarities with the bombings in Bali in October 2002, about a year later (and the novel was published on 27 August 2001, a few days before the 11 September 2001 attacks). A similar eery coincidence, involving Houellebecq, Islam and terrorism, would occur 13 years later, when his novel Submission, dealing with Islam again (although in a more nuanced and less confrontational way), was published on 7 January 2015, the day of the Charlie Hebdo shooting. A play in Spanish based on the book, adapted and directed by Calixto Bieito, premiered at the 2006 Edinburgh International Festival. Plot summary The story is the first-person narrative of a fictional character named Michel Renault, a Parisian civil servant who, after the death of his father and thanks to a hefty inheritance, engages in sexual tourism in Thailand, where he meets a travel agent named Val√©rie. Valerie and Renault begin an affair, and, after moving back to France, hatch a plan with Valerie's boss (who works in the travel industry in the Aurore group, an allusion to the real-life Accor group) to launch a new variety of package holiday called \\"friendly tourism\\", implicitly aimed at Europeans looking for a sexual experience whilst on vacation. Single men and women‚Äîand even couples‚Äîare to be targeted, and would vacation in specially designed \\"Aphrodite Clubs\\". Initially, the name \\"Venus clubs\\"‚Äîan allusion to the Villa Venus clubs dreamed of by Eric Veen in Vladimir Nabokov's classic Ada or Ardor‚Äîis suggested, but is rejected as being too explicit. It is decided that Thailand is the best location for the new clubs, with the advertising making it clear that Thai women would also be easily available. The tours are to be marketed predominantly to German consumers, as it is perceived that there will be less moral outrage in Germany than in France. Michel, Valerie and her boss Jean-Yves travel to Thailand on one of their company's tours incognito and enjoy an idyllic holiday. They decide that they will move to Thailand permanently, to perpetuate the bliss they experience there. However, towards the end of their holiday, Muslim extremists commit a terrorist act in which Val√©rie is killed. Michel is left bereft, and at the end of the novel he travels back to Thailand to die. At this point, the reader realizes that the novel is in fact his suicide note.

He is the grandson of J. R. R. Tolkien, and the oldest child of Christopher Tolkien. Biography Simon was born in Oxford on 12 January 1959, the only child of Christopher Tolkien and his first wife, Faith Faulconbridge. His parents separated when he was five years old and he grew up with his mother. He was educated at the Dragon School in Oxford and then Downside School. He studied modern history at Trinity College, Oxford, after which he embarked on a fifteen-year career as a criminal lawyer. In 1984, he married Tracy Steinberg, who was born in 1962. They have two children, a son Nicholas and a daughter Anna. Tracy owned and operated a vintage clothing store in Chelsea, London, called Steinberg & Tolkien, which shut in September 2007. He became a barrister in 1994. Tolkien currently lives in southern California with his wife Tracy. Simon's son Nicholas is a playwright and director who debuted with his first play Terezin in June 2017. Writings In January 2000, he began writing fiction. His first novel, which he has described as a black comedy, was not accepted for publication. His second novel, a courtroom drama, was published in the United States as The Final Witness in 2002 and in the United Kingdom as The Stepmother in 2003. His second published work, The Inheritance (the first of a trilogy featuring Inspector Trave of the Oxfordshire Criminal Investigation Department), was published in 2010. The second book of the Inspector Trave trilogy, The King of Diamonds, was published in 2011. The third and final book in the trilogy, Orders from Berlin, was published in 2012. His 2016 novel, No Man's Land: a Novel, was published concurrent with the 100-year anniversary of the Battle of the Somme; the middle third of the novel is set in that months-long World War I battle. The novel follows the life of a poor English child and young adult (Adam Raine), beginning with episodes of labour unrest in London and on to the strikes in coal mining communities, class distinctions, and home front experiences of World War I. Simon Tolkien acknowledges that the experiences of Adam Raine only superficially resemble those faced by his grandfather (J. R. R. Tolkien) in the same large long battle of the war, but he wanted to write something that in part paid tribute to his grandfather's pivotal war experience as a young man, only a few years older than the age of the protagonist of No Man's Land. Reaction to filmed versions of J. R. R. Tolkien's works Simon Tolkien disagreed with the policy of his grandfather's estate in regard to The Lord of the Rings films. When Christopher Tolkien issued a statement that the \\"Tolkien estate would be best advised to avoid any specific association with the films\\", Simon Tolkien broke ranks, offering to cooperate with the filmmakers, stating \\"It was my view that we take a much more positive line on the film and that was overruled by my father.\\" Following up a 2001 interview with the Independent, Simon in 2003 gave interviews to the Daily Telegraph and other media in which he discussed his strained relationship with his father, describing it as a permanent breach. However, they subsequently reconciled.

The film was directed by Erich von Stroheim, starred Gloria Swanson, in the title role, Walter Byron as her lover, and Seena Owen. The film was produced by Joseph P. Kennedy, who was Swanson's lover at the time. In 1932, Swanson was able to release a part-sound version in Europe and South America only because of her contract with Stroheim. This version had an alternate ending directed by Richard Boleslawski and filmed by cinematographer Gregg Toland.Profile, silentera.com; accessed 17 December 2017. Plot Prince Wolfram (Byron) is the betrothed of mad Queen Regina V of Kronberg (Owen). As punishment for partying with other women, he is sent on manoeuvres. He sees Kitty Kelly (Swanson) walking with other convent students and flirts with her. She is embarrassed when he makes a comment after seeing that her underwear is visible, so she takes it off and throws it at him, to the horror of the nuns, who punish her for her \\"indecency\\". Enthralled by her beauty, he kidnaps her that night from the convent, takes her to his room and professes his love for her. When the queen finds them together the next morning, she whips Kelly and throws her out of the castle. Regina then puts Wolfram in prison for not wanting to marry her. =Endings= Original ending: Kelly goes to German East Africa to visit her dying aunt and is forced to marry a repulsive man named Jan. The aunt dies after the wedding and Kelly refuses to live with him, instead becoming the madam of her aunt's brothel. Her extravagances and style earn her the name \\"Queen Kelly\\". Alternate ending: Kelly dies in despair after her humiliation at the hands of the queen. Wolfram, contrite, visits her body.

Though the European scenes were full of innuendo, and featured a philandering prince and a sex-crazed queen, the scenes set in Africa were grim and, Swanson felt, distasteful. In later interviews, Swanson had claimed that she had been misled by the script which referred to her character arriving in, and taking over, a dance hall; looking at the rushes, it was obvious the 'dance hall' was actually a brothel. Stroheim was fired from the film, and the African storyline scrapped. Swanson and Kennedy still wanted to salvage the European material because it had been so costly and time-consuming, and had potential market value. An alternate ending was, however, shot on November 24, 1931. In this ending, Kelly dies after her experiences with the prince (it is implied to be suicide). Prince Wolfram is shown visiting the palace. A nun leads him to the chapel, where Kelly's body lies in state. These scenes were directed by Richard Boleslawski, photographed by Gregg Toland, and edited by Viola Lawrence. This has been called the 'Swanson Ending'. Distribution The film was not released theatrically in the United States, but it was shown in Europe and South America with the 'Swanson ending' added. This was due to a clause in Stroheim's contract. In 1933, von Stroheim submitted a script called Poto Poto to MGM. Though it was never produced, the script contained several elements recycled from the African story of Queen Kelly. A short extract of the film appears in Sunset Boulevard (1950), representing an old silent picture Swanson's character Norma Desmond - herself a silent movie star - had made. Von Stroheim is also a primary character in Sunset Boulevard as her ex- director, ex-husband, and current butler. By some accounts, von Stroheim suggested the clip be used for its heavy irony. This was the first time viewers in the U.S. got to see any footage of the infamous collaboration. In the 1960s, it was shown on television with the Swanson ending, along with a taped introduction and conclusion in which Swanson talked about the history of the project. By 1985, Kino International had acquired the rights to the movie and restored two versions: one that uses still photos and subtitles in an attempt to wrap up the storyline, and the other the European \\"suicide ending\\" version. Kino remains the rights holder and is responsible for all distribution, including television and home video.

When issuing a writ of execution, a court typically will order a sheriff or other similar official to take possession of property owned by a judgment debtor. Such property will often then be sold in a sheriff's sale and the proceeds remunerated to the plaintiff in partial or full satisfaction of the judgment. It is generally considered preferable for the sheriff simply to take possession of money from the defendant's bank account. If the judgment debtor owns real property, the judgment creditor can record the execution to \\"freeze\\" the title until the execution is satisfied. Generally, execution is unnecessary for defendants who pay verdicts against themselves voluntarily. However, some defendants ignore judgments against them, and thereby force plaintiffs to employ writs of execution to actually enforce judgments. In the United States, not all assets are subject to execution. For example, Social Security income that resides in a bank account is exempt from a levy on a debtor's bank account. Many states also protect an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) from execution as well as unemployment income, but the amount that is exempt may be limited.

Biography Born in Florence to a family that had originated at Montevarchi, he frequented the neoplatonic academy that Bernardo Rucellai organized in his garden, the Orti Oricellari; there, in spite of the fact that Rucellai was married to the elder sister of Lorenzo de' Medici, republican ideals circulated, in the context of revived classical culture, that culminated in a plot in 1513 to subvert Medici rule in Florence. At Pisa, Varchi studied to become a notary. With his return to Florence, he fought in the defense of the temporarily revived Republic of Florence, during the siege by the Mediceans and imperialists in 1530, and was exiled after the surrender of the city; he spent time at Padua (1537), where he was a prot√©g√© of the √©migr√© Piero Strozzi and at Bologna (1540). In 1536 he took part in Strozzi's unsuccessful expedition against Medicean rule, but seven years later Varchi was called back to Florence by Cosimo I, who gave him a pension and commissioned him to write a history of the city. His Storia fiorentina (16 vol.) covers the period from 1527 to 1538, though it was so frank it was not published in Florence until 1721. Varchi also wrote a number of plays, poems, dialogues and translations from the classics. With his return to Medici patronage, he became a member of the Accademia fiorentina, occupied with studies of linguistics, literary criticism, esthetics and philosophy, but also, as became a Renaissance humanist in botany and alchemy. His tract L'Hercolano, in the form of a dialogue between the writer and a conte Ercolano, discussed the Tuscan dialect as it was spoken at Florence, in the vulgar rather than in Latin, an innovation in works of linguistics; it was published posthumously, in 1570.Ercolano, dialogo nel qual si ragiona generalmente delle lingue e in particolare della fiorentina e della toscana, Giunti, Firenze 1570. He wrote a comedy La Suocera (\\"The Mother-in-Law\\"). Towards the end of his life he had a spiritual crisis and took holy orders. In Ezra Pound's CANTOS, Varchi is mentioned with approbation (Canto V) for his honesty as an historian who did not try to fill in gaps in an historical record just to make that record neat. Rather, he was willing to admit that he did not know or that the motives or the events surrounding a particular incident could not be absolutely determined. Pound gives as an example of Varchi's honesty his investigation‚Äîfor his history of Florence‚Äîof the murder of Alessandro de' Medici. Varchi admitted that after all his attempts to uncover the facts he could not decide on the motives of Alessandro's murderer (Lorenzino de' Medici, Alessandro's cousin). Homosexuality In his time Varchi was notorious for his many sonnets to young boys. Though his loves were not always reciprocated, and despite his denunciations of men who engaged in \\"filthy loves,\\" he was criticized by his contemporaries for his attachments to young boys. One critic mocked him in a satire: \\"O father Varchi, new Socrates . . . his arms open and his trousers down, this is how your Bembo is waiting for you in the Elyssian Fields.\\" Another comments on his legacy, \\"But since he was always inclined to boy love . . . he greatly lessened the reputation that would have been rightfully appropriate.\\"Homosexuality & Civilization By Louis Crompton; pp.277-8 In 1545, Varchi was arrested and tried for pederasty, and was eventually pardoned by Cosimo de' Medici upon the intercession of his many friends.Encyclopedia of Italian literary studies By Gaetana Marrone, Paolo Puppa, Luca Somigli; p.1949 References *An extensive bibliography may be found at Italian Wikipedia: \\"Benedetto Varchi\\" Further reading (Italian) * Due lezioni; * Il discorso della bellezza e della grazia; * Rime.

It consists of about 50 houses and one pub, Spillane's. Fahamore was historically much more populated than it is now as evidenced by two old schoolhouses in the village, one dating from 1849 and the other from 1911. Fahamore is located on the shore of Brandon Bay and is a centre for diving, surfing, windsurfing and sea bass fishing. It is also a centre for currach building, and currachs are still used locally, including at the local fishing harbour at Scraggane. History There is evidence of prehistoric settlement at the cliff face at Fahamore in the form of shell middens. A survey of the middens can be found in the book \\"Archaeological Survey of the Dingle Peninsula\\". Local oral histories tell of a night in 1839, known as the Night of the Big Wind, when there was a particularly bad storm. A three masted sailing ship, the Charger, carrying a cargo of deal, was wrecked in Carralougha in 1890 - the remains of the ship's boilers are still in evidence on the rocks near Fahamore at low tide. A sea wall was built, probably in the 19th century, to prevent coastal erosion - it had limited success, as it now lies in pieces about 20m from the cliff edge - in the 1990s rock armour was put in place by Kerry County Council to protect the coast from Fahamore southwards for a distance of about two kilometers. A list of local placenames and their origins is contained in the book \\"Triocha Cead Corca Dhuibhne\\" by P√°draig √ì Siochfhradha (An Seabhac). The original Irish name of Fahamore, An Fhaiche Mh√≥r, means the 'Big Green'. This is believed to be a reference to the big open green area in front of Spillane's bar. Geography Brandon Bay near Fahamore Villages near Fahamore (i.e. on the Maharees peninsula) include Cutteen, Garrywilliam, Barr na Duiche, Ceann Duiche and Kilshanig. Access to the beach at Brandon Bay is via the Point Gap and Maherabeg Cut. Economy=Fishing= The pier at Fahamore (situated on the western side of Scraggane Bay) is used during the summer months by the local fishing fleet, which consists of around 20 half-decked and decked boats in the range 7‚Äì15 metres. Species fished include the European lobster (Homarus gammarus), spiny lobster or crayfish, spider crab, edible crab, and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). In the winter there is a managed fishery in Tralee Bay for the European oyster (Ostrea edulis). Fishing methods include pots and tangle nets for crabs, lobsters and crayfish and monofilament drift nets for salmon. Shellfish are typically stored in large wooden \\"storeboxes\\", which are moored in Scraggane Bay, until the day of selling, when they are transferred to \\"vivier\\" trucks for live export to Spain and France. The \\"fish pond\\" at Kilshanig, which was originally intended to store lobsters, is now used as an abalone farm. =Agriculture= The fields around Fahamore are cultivated with vegetables including carrots, parsnips, swedes and onions, which thrive in the sandy soil. There has is also some dairying activity and raising of cattle for beef. =Tourism= Tourism is a contributor to the local economy, through holiday home rentals, pubs and restaurants, surfing, windsurfing, scuba diving, walking and sea angling. Fahamore is also a centre for currach (or naomh√≥g) building, and currachs are still used as both fishing boats and trawler tenders at the local fishing harbour on Scraggane Bay. Fahamore hosts a currach racing regatta every July where teams from the western seaboard of Ireland (from Kerry to Galway) compete in the All-Ireland Currach racing series. Flora and fauna Rabbits abound around Fahamore, as do rats, mice and the odd fox and badger. Local birds include seabirds (including several species of seagull, shags, cormorants, and gannets), larks, starlings, curlews, crows, ravens, garden birds such as sparrows, robins and finches, and wading birds such as the heron. The swallow is a common visitor in the summer months. Marine mammals including seals and dolphins are sometimes seen. Fish include sea bass, mullet, pollack, wrasse, dogfish, sea trout, flounder, plaice and ray. Shellfish found in the intertidal zone at Fahamore include mussels, limpets, periwinkles and whelks, as well as several species of crab, including shore, velvet and hermit. Lugworms are found in the sand and their casts may be seen at low tide. They are frequently dug by local anglers and used as bait for bass fishing. Seaweeds include kelp, several varieties of wrack (including bladder and serrated), dilisc (or dulse), agar, sea grass, sea lettuce and carrageen moss.

(June 23, 1892 - February 27, 1979) was an American cinematographer and inventor.. He was nominated for seven Academy Awards. Career His Hollywood career began in 1909 as a lab assistant with the Essanay Film Manufacturing Company in Chicago. He went to work as a lab technician for the American Film Manufacturing Company (known as \\"Flying A\\"), also in Chicago.Steeman, Albert. Internet Encyclopedia of Cinematographers, \\"John F. Seitz page,\\" Rotterdam, The Netherlands, 2007. Last accessed: December 13, 2007. Seitz got his first chance to establish himself as lead cameraman in 1916, and he achieved great success with the director Rex Ingram, most famously on the Rudolph Valentino film, The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (1921). Highly regarded by director Billy Wilder, Seitz worked with him on the film noirs Double Indemnity (1944), The Lost Weekend (1945), and Sunset Boulevard (1950), receiving Academy Award nominations for each. During his career he received seven nominations for Academy Award for Best Cinematography. In 1929 he served as president of the American Society of Cinematographers (A.S.C.) for a year, and had been a member since 1923. The A.S.C. named the 2002 Heritage Award after Seitz. Seitz retired in 1960 and devoted himself to photographic inventions for which he held 18 patents. An example of a Seitz invention is the matte shot: a large painting is photographed separately and later added to a scene to expand it, add effects, and/or create a sense of depth in backgrounds. He was also noted for his innovations with low-key lighting, which enhanced the film noir style.. A widower, he married screenwriter Marie Boyle in 1934 who raised his daughter Margaret Alice Marhoefer and later gave birth to a son, John Lawrence Seitz. Burial: Holy Cross Cemetery.

Tide heights at intermediate times (between high and low water) can be approximated by using the rule of twelfths or more accurately calculated by using a published tidal curve for the location. Tide levels are typically given relative to a low- water vertical datum, e.g. the mean lower low water (MLLW) datum in the US.Tidal Datums And Their Applications, NOAA Special Publication NOS CO-OPS 1, Silver Spring MD, June 2000. Publication and scope Tide tables are published in various forms, such as paper-based tables and tables available on the Internet. Most tide tables are calculated and published only for major ports, called \\"standard ports\\", and only for one year ‚Äî standard ports can be relatively close together or hundreds of kilometers apart. The tide times for a minor port are estimated by the tide-table user manually calculating using the published time and height differences between a standard port and the minor port. Dates and times The dates of spring tides and neap tides, approximately seven days apart, can be determined by the heights of the tides on the classic tide tables: a small range indicates neaps and large indicates springs. This cycle of tides is linked to the phases of the moon, with the highest tides (spring tides) occurring near full moon and new moon. However, successive (semidiurnal) tides are linked to the Moon's orbital period, thus they are approximately 24/27.3 hours later each day or about 50 minutes but many other observations and considerations are required to develop accurate tide tables. On the Atlantic coast of northwest Europe, the interval between each low and high tide averages about 6 hours and 10 minutes, giving two high tides and two low tides each day, with the highest tides about 2 days after full moon. Calculation Tide prediction was long beset by the problem of laborious calculations. Before the use of digital computers tide tables were often generated by the use of a special-purpose calculating machine, the tide- predicting machine.

He also took interest in the claims of parapsychology and spiritualism.Noakes, Richard. (2007). Cromwell Varley FRS, Electrical Discharge and Victorian Spiritualism. The Royal Society Journal of the History of Science. 61: 5‚Äì21. Family Born in Kentish Town, London, Cromwell Fleetwood Varley was the second of ten children. His father was Cornelius Varley, an active member of the Society of Arts (now the Royal Society of Arts), best known for his scientific research. His mother was the former Elizabeth Livermore Straker. C.F. Varley's brothers, Samuel Alfred Varley and Frederick Henry Varley, were also improvers and inventors in connection with telegraphy. The family believed themselves the descendants of Oliver Cromwell and General Charles Fleetwood, hence his given names. The family were Sandemanians, part of the same congregation as Michael Faraday, but Varley did not continue his association with the sect into adult life. A first cousin was the microscopist Andrew Pritchard.Hunt (2004) Telegraph engineer Varley joined the newly founded Electric Telegraph Company in 1846, becoming chief engineer for the London area by 1852 and for the entire company by 1861. He devised many techniques and instruments for fault-finding and for improving the performance of the telegraph. In 1870, he patented the cymaphen, a kind of telegraph that could transmit speech. The first transatlantic telegraph cable failed in 1858 and Varley was appointed to an investigative committee, set up jointly by the first Atlantic cable in 1858, he was appointed to a joint investigative committee established by the Board of Trade and the Atlantic Telegraph Company. The committee reported in 1861 and resulted in a second cable in 1865, Varley replacing Wildman Whitehouse as chief electrician. Despite the difficulties of the second cable, it was an ultimate success and Varley developed many improvements in technology. Varley was an astute businessman and the partnership that he formed with the 1st Baron Kelvin and Fleeming Jenkin to exploit their respective telegraphic inventions yielded large profits for the three men. Spiritualism He was sympathetic to the claims of Spiritualism and carried out investigations with fellow physicist William Crookes using a galvanometer to make measurements of the supposed phenomena. Cathode rays In 1871, he authored a scientific paper suggesting that cathode rays were streams of particles of electricity. Varley believed cathode radiation was caused by the collision of particles. His belief was based on the idea that because the rays were deflected in the presence of a magnet, these particles have to be considered carriers of an electric charge. This led him to believe that the electrically charged particles should be deflected by the presence of an electric field. He was never able to prove this. Scandal Varley had two sons and two daughters with his first wife, Ellen (n√©e Rouse), whom he married on 4 October 1855. Upon returning from a trip abroad, he discovered that his wife had gone off with Ion Perdicaris, a wealthy Greek-American. After the divorce was granted in 1873, she and the children settled with Perdicaris at Tangiers, Morocco. In 1904, Varley's elder son, also named Cromwell, was kidnapped along with Perdicaris by Mulai Ahmed er Raisuni, precipitating an international incident before both men were released unharmed. On 11 January 1877, Varley married Heleanor Jessie Smith, daughter of Capt. Charles Smith of Forres, Scotland. Death C.F. Varley died at Cromwell House, Bexleyheath, Kent, in 1883, aged 55, from undisclosed causes.

Life His early years (from 1627) were spent at Uelzen, where his father was court preacher to the duke of Brunswick. Varenius studied at the gymnasium of Hamburg (1640‚Äì1642), and at K√∂nigsberg (1643‚Äì1645) and Leiden (1645‚Äì1649) universities, where he devoted himself to mathematics and medicine, taking his medical degree at Leiden in 1649. He then settled at Amsterdam, intending to practice medicine. But the recent discoveries of Abel Tasman, Willem Schouten and other Dutch navigators, and his friendship for Willem Blaeu and other geographers, attracted Varenius to geography. He died in 1650, aged only twenty-eight, a victim to the privations and miseries of a poor scholar's life. This cites: *Breusing, \\"Lebensnachrichten von Bernhard Varenius\\" (Geogr. Mittheil., 1880) *H. Blink's paper on Varenius in Tijdschr. van het Nederl. Aandrijksk. Genotschap (1887), ser. ii. pt. 3 *F. Ratzel's article \\"Bernhard Varenius,\\" in Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie, vol. xxxix. (Leipzig, 1895) Works In 1649 he published, through L. Elzevir of Amsterdam, his Descriptio Regni Japoniae. In this was included a translation into Latin of part of Jodocus Schouten's account of Siam (Appendix de religione Siamensium, ex Descriptione Belgica Iodoci Schoutenii), and chapters on the religions of various peoples. Next year (1650) appeared, also through Elzevir, the work by which he is best known, his Geographia Generalis, in which he endeavored to lay down the general principles of the subject on a wide scientific basis, according to the knowledge of his day. The work is divided into (1) absolute geography, (2) relative geography and (3) comparative geography. The first investigates mathematical facts relating to the earth as a whole, its figure, dimensions, motions, their measurement, etc. The second part considers the earth as affected by the sun and stars, climates, seasons, the difference of apparent time at different places, variations in the length of the day, etc. The third part treats briefly the actual divisions of the surface of the earth, their relative positions, globe and map-construction, longitude, navigation, etc. Varenius, with the materials at his command, dealt with the subject of geography in a truly philosophic spirit; and his work long held its position as the best treatise in existence on scientific and comparative geography. The work went through many editions. Sir Isaac Newton introduced several important improvements into the Cambridge edition of 1672; in 1715 James Jurin issued another Cambridge edition with a valuable appendix; in 1733 the whole work was translated into English by Dugdale; and in 1736 Dugdale's second edition was revised by Shaw. In 1716 an Italian edition appeared at Naples; in 1750 a Dutch translation followed; in 1751 Osman b. Abdulemennan translated it into Turkish; and in 1755 a French version, from Shaw's edition, came out at Paris. Among later geographers d'Anville and Alexander von Humboldt especially drew attention to Varen's genius and services to science.

For technologies developed in medieval societies, see Medieval technology and Inventions in medieval Islam. A significant number of inventions were developed in the Islamic world; a geopolitical region that has at times extended from al-Andalus and Africa in the west to the Indian subcontinent and Malay Archipelago in the east. Many of these inventions had direct implications for Fiqh related issues.  Ancient civilizations =Africa= Technology in Africa has a history stretching to the beginning of the human species, stretching back to the first evidence of tool use by hominid ancestors in the areas of Africa where humans are believed to have evolved. Africa saw the advent of some of the earliest ironworking technology in the A√Ør Mountains region of what is today Niger and the erection of some of the world's oldest monuments, pyramids and towers in Egypt, Nubia, and North Africa. In Nubia and ancient Kush, glazed quartzite and building in brick was developed to a greater extent than in Egypt. Parts of the East African Swahili Coast saw the creation of the world's oldest carbon steel creation with high- temperature blast furnaces created by the Haya people of Tanzania. = Mesopotamia = They were one of the first Bronze Age people in the world. Early on they used copper, bronze and gold, and later they used iron. Palaces were decorated with hundreds of kilograms of these very expensive metals. Also, copper, bronze, and iron were used for armor as well as for different weapons such as swords, daggers, spears, and maces. Perhaps the most important advance made by the Mesopotamians was the invention of writing by the Sumerians. With the invention of writing came the first recorded laws called the Code of Hammurabi as well as the first major piece of literature called the Epic of Gilgamesh. Several of the six classic simple machines were invented in Mesopotamia. Mesopotamians have been credited with the invention of the wheel. The wheel and axle mechanism first appeared with the potter's wheel, invented in Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) during the 5th millennium BC. This led to the invention of the wheeled vehicle in Mesopotamia during the early 4th millennium BC. Depictions of wheeled wagons found on clay tablet pictographs at the Eanna district of Uruk are dated between 3700‚Äì3500 BCE. The lever was used in the shadoof water-lifting device, the first crane machine, which appeared in Mesopotamia circa 3000 BC. and then in ancient Egyptian technology circa 2000 BC. The earliest evidence of pulleys date back to Mesopotamia in the early 2nd millennium BC. The screw, the last of the simple machines to be invented, first appeared in Mesopotamia during the Neo-Assyrian period (911-609) BC. According to the assyriologist Stephanie Dalley, the earliest pump was the screw pump, first used by Sennacherib, King of Assyria, for the water systems at the Hanging Gardens of Babylon and Nineveh in the 7th century BCE. This attribution, however, is disputed by the historian John Peter Oleson.Stephanie Dalley and John Peter Oleson (January 2003). \\"Sennacherib, Archimedes, and the Water Screw: The Context of Invention in the Ancient World\\", Technology and Culture 44 (1). The Mesopotamians used a sexagesimal number system with the base 60 (like we use base 10). They divided time up by 60s including a 60-second minute and a 60-minute hour, which we still use today. They also divided up the circle into 360 degrees. They had a wide knowledge of mathematics including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, quadratic and cubic equations, and fractions. This was important in keeping track of records as well as in some of their large building projects. The Mesopotamians had formulas for figuring out the circumference and area for different geometric shapes like rectangles, circles, and triangles. Some evidence suggests that they even knew the Pythagorean Theorem long before Pythagoras wrote it down. They may have even discovered the number for pi in figuring the circumference of a circle. Babylonian astronomy was able to follow the movements of the stars, planets, and the Moon. Application of advanced math predicted the movements of several planets. By studying the phases of the Moon, the Mesopotamians created the first calendar. It had 12 lunar months and was the predecessor for both the Jewish and Greek calendars. Babylonian medicine used logic and recorded medical history to be able to diagnose and treat illnesses with various creams and pills. Mesopotamians had two kinds of medical practices, magical and physical. Unlike today they would use both on the same patient. They didn't see it as one as good and one as bad.Robert Alan Chadwick, First Civilization: Ancient Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt (2) (London: Equinox Publishing Ltd, 2005), 119. The Mesopotamians made many technological discoveries. They were the first to use the potter's wheel to make better pottery, they used irrigation to get water to their crops, they used bronze metal (and later iron metal) to make strong tools and weapons, and used looms to weave cloth from wool. The Jerwan Aqueduct (c. 688 BC) is made with stone arches and lined with waterproof concrete.T Jacobsen and S Lloyd, Sennacherib's Aqueduct at Jerwan, Chicago University Press, (1935) For later technologies developed in the Mesopotamian region, now known as Iraq, see Persia below for developments under the ancient Persian Empire, and the Inventions in medieval Islam and Arab Agricultural Revolution articles for developments under the medieval Islamic Caliphates. =Egypt= Left half of the Turin papyrus map, courtesy J. Harrell The Egyptians invented and used many simple machines, such as the ramp to aid construction processes. They were among the first to extract gold by large-scale mining using fire-setting, and the first recognisable map, the Turin papyrus shows the plan of one such mine in Nubia. The Egyptians are known for building pyramids centuries before the creation of modern tools. Historians and archaeologists have found evidence that the Egyptian pyramids were built using three of what is called the Six Simple Machines, from which all machines are based. These machines are the inclined plane, the wedge, and the lever, which allowed the ancient Egyptians to move millions of limestone blocks which weighed approximately 3.5 tons (7,000 lbs.) each into place to create structures like the Great Pyramid of Giza, which is 481 feet (146.7 meters) high. Egyptian paper, made from papyrus, and pottery were mass-produced and exported throughout the Mediterranean basin. The wheel, however, did not arrive until foreign invaders introduced the chariot. They developed Mediterranean maritime technology including ships and lighthouses. Early construction techniques utilized by the Ancient Egyptians made use of bricks composed mainly of clay, sand, silt, and other minerals. These constructs would have been vital in flood control and irrigation, especially along the Nile delta.Jerzy Trzci√±ski , Malgorzata Zaremba , Sawomir Rzepka , Fabian Welc , and Tomasz Szczepa√±ski. ‚ÄúPreliminary Report on Engineering Properties and Environmental Resistance of Ancient Mud Bricks from Tell El-retaba Archaeological Site in the Nile Delta,‚Äù Studia Quarternaria 33, no. 1 (2016): 55. The screw pump is the oldest positive displacement pump. The first records of a screw pump, also known as a water screw or Archimedes' screw, dates back to Ancient Egypt before the 3rd century BC. The Egyptian screw, used to lift water from the Nile, was composed of tubes wound round a cylinder; as the entire unit rotates, water is lifted within the spiral tube to the higher elevation. A later screw pump design from Egypt had a spiral groove cut on the outside of a solid wooden cylinder and then the cylinder was covered by boards or sheets of metal closely covering the surfaces between the grooves. The screw pump was later introduced from Egypt to Greece. For later technologies in Ptolemaic Egypt and Roman Egypt, see Ancient Greek technology and Roman technology, respectively. For later technology in medieval Arabic Egypt, see Inventions in medieval Islam and Arab Agricultural Revolution. = Indian subcontinent = The history of science and technology in the Indian subcontinent dates back to the earliest civilizations of the world. The Indus Valley civilization yields evidence of mathematics, hydrography, metrology, metallurgy, astronomy, medicine, surgery, civil engineering and sewage collection and disposal being practiced by its inhabitants. The Indus Valley Civilization, situated in a resource-rich area (in modern Pakistan and northwestern India), is notable for its early application of city planning, sanitation technologies, and plumbing. Cities in the Indus Valley offer some of the first examples of closed gutters, public baths, and communal granaries. The Takshashila University was an important seat of learning in the ancient world. It was the center of education for scholars from all over Asia. Many Greek, Persian and Chinese students studied here under great scholars including Kautilya, Panini, Jivaka, and Vishnu Sharma. Excavated ruins of Mohenjo-daro, Pakistan. The ancient system of medicine in India, Ayurveda was a significant milestone in Indian history. It mainly uses herbs as medicines. Its origins can be traced back to origin of Atharvaveda. The Sushruta Samhita (400 BC) by Sushruta has details about performing cataract surgery, plastic surgery, etc. Ancient India was also at the forefront of seafaring technology - a panel found at Mohenjo-daro, depicts a sailing craft. Ship construction is vividly described in the Yukti Kalpa Taru, an ancient Indian text on Shipbuilding. (The Yukti Kalpa Taru had been translated and published by Prof. Aufrecht in his 'Catalogue of Sanskrit Manuscripts'). Indian construction and architecture, called 'Vaastu Shastra', suggests a thorough understanding or materials engineering, hydrology, and sanitation. Ancient Indian culture was also pioneering in its use of vegetable dyes, cultivating plants including indigo and cinnabar. Many of the dyes were used in art and sculpture. The use of perfumes demonstrates some knowledge of chemistry, particularly distillation and purification processes. = China = Chinese armillary sphere The history of science and technology in China shows significant advances in science, technology, mathematics, and astronomy. The first recorded observations of comets, solar eclipses, and supernovae were made in China. Traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture and herbal medicine were also practiced. The Four Great Inventions of China: the compass, gunpowder, papermaking, and printing were among the most important technological advances, only known in Europe by the end of the Middle Ages. According to the Scottish researcher Joseph Needham, the Chinese made many first-known discoveries and developments. Major technological contributions from China include early seismological detectors, matches, paper, the double- action piston pump, cast iron, the iron plough, the multi-tube seed drill, the suspension bridge, natural gas as fuel, the magnetic compass, the raised- relief map, the propeller, the crossbow, the south-pointing chariot, and gunpowder. Other Chinese discoveries and inventions from the Medieval period, according to Joseph Needham's research, include: block printing and movable type, phosphorescent paint, and the spinning wheel. The solid-fuel rocket was invented in China about 1150 AD, nearly 200 years after the invention of black powder (which acted as the rocket's fuel). At the same time that the age of exploration was occurring in the West, the Chinese emperors of the Ming Dynasty also sent ships, some reaching Africa. But the enterprises were not further funded, halting further exploration and development. When Ferdinand Magellan's ships reached Brunei in 1521, they found a wealthy city that had been fortified by Chinese engineers, and protected by a breakwater. Antonio Pigafetta noted that much of the technology of Brunei was equal to Western technology of the time. Also, there were more cannons in Brunei than on Magellan's ships, and the Chinese merchants to the Brunei court had sold them spectacles and porcelain, which were rarities in Europe. =Persian Empire= The Qanat, a water management system used for irrigation, originated in Iran before the Achaemenid period of Persia. The oldest and largest known qanat is in the Iranian city of Gonabad which, after 2,700 years, still provides drinking and agricultural water to nearly 40,000 people. The earliest evidence of water wheels and watermills date back to the ancient Near East in the 4th century BC,Terry S. Reynolds, Stronger than a Hundred Men: A History of the Vertical Water Wheel, JHU Press, 2002 , p. 14 specifically in the Persian Empire before 350 BCE, in the regions of Mesopotamia (Iraq) and Persia (Iran). This pioneering use of water power constituted the first human-devised motive force not to rely on muscle power (besides the sail). In the 7th century AD, Persians in Afghanistan developed the first practical windmills. For later medieval technologies developed in Islamic Persia, see Inventions in medieval Islam and Arab Agricultural Revolution. = Mesoamerica and Andean Region = Lacking suitable beasts of burden and inhabiting domains often too mountainous or boggy for wheeled transport, the ancient civilizations of the Americas did not develop wheeled transport or the mechanics associated with animal power. Nevertheless, they produced advanced engineering including above ground and underground aqueducts, quake-proof masonry, artificial lakes, dykes, 'fountains,' pressurized water, road ways and complex terracing. Equally, gold-working commenced early in Peru (2000 BCE), and eventually copper, tin, lead and bronze were used. Although metallurgy did not spread to Mesoamerica until the Middle Ages, it was employed here and in the Andes for sophisticated alloys and gilding. The Native Americans developed a complex understanding of the chemical properties or utility of natural substances, with the result that a majority of the world's early medicinal drugs and edible crops, many important adhesives, paints, fibres, plasters, and other useful items were the products of these civilizations. Perhaps the best-known Mesoamerican invention was rubber, which was used to create rubber bands, rubber bindings, balls, syringes, 'raincoats,' boots, and waterproof insulation on containers and flasks. = Hellenistic Mediterranean = The Hellenistic period of Mediterranean history began in the 4th century BC with Alexander's conquests, which led to the emergence of a Hellenistic civilization representing a synthesis of Greek and Near-Eastern cultures in the Eastern Mediterranean region, including the Balkans, Levant and Egypt.Green, Peter. Alexander to Actium: The Historical Evolution of the Hellenistic Age. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1990. With Ptolemaic Egypt as its intellectual center and Greek as the lingua franca, the Hellenistic civilization included Greek, Egyptian, Jewish, Persian and Phoenician scholars and engineers who wrote in Greek.George G. Joseph (2000). The Crest of the Peacock, p. 7-8. Princeton University Press. . Hellenistic technology made significant progress from the 4th century BC, continuing up to and including the Roman period. Some inventions that are credited to the ancient Greeks are the following: bronze casting techniques, water organ (hydraulis), and torsion siege engine. Many of these inventions occurred late in the Hellenistic period, often inspired by the need to improve weapons and tactics in war. Hellenistic engineers of the Eastern Mediterranean were responsible for a number of inventions and improvements to existing technology. Archimedes invented several machines. Hellenistic engineers often combined scientific research with the development of new technologies. Technologies invented by Hellenistic engineers include the ballistae, the piston pump, and primitive analog computers like the Antikythera mechanism. Hellenistic architects built domes, and were the first to explore the Golden ratio and its relationship with geometry and architecture. Other Hellenistic innovations include torsion catapults, pneumatic catapults, crossbows, rutways, organs, the keyboard mechanism, differential gears, showers, dry docks, diving bells, odometer and astrolabes. In architecture, Hellenistic engineers constructed monumental lighthouses such as the Pharos and devised central heating systems. The Tunnel of Eupalinos is the earliest tunnel which has been excavated with a scientific approach from both ends. Automata like automatic doors and other ingenious devices were built by Hellenistic engineers as Ctesibius and Philo of Byzantium. Greek technological treatises were scrupulously studied and advanced by later Byzantine, Arabic and Latin scholars, and provided some of the foundations for further technological advances in these civilizations. = Roman Empire = Pont du Gard in France, a Roman aqueduct Drainage wheel from Rio Tinto mines Hero's wind-powered organ (reconstruction) The Roman Empire expanded from Italia across the entire Mediterranean region between the 1st century BC and 1st century AD. Its most advanced and economically productive provinces outside of Italia were the Eastern Roman provinces in the Balkans, Asia Minor, Egypt, and the Levant, with Roman Egypt in particular being the wealthiest Roman province outside of Italia.Maddison, Angus (2007), Contours of the World Economy, 1‚Äì2030 AD: Essays in Macro-Economic History, p. 55, table 1.14, Oxford University Press, Roman technology supported Roman civilization and made the expansion of Roman commerce and Roman military possible over nearly a thousand years. The Roman Empire had an advanced set of technology for their time. Some of the Roman technology in Europe may have been lost during the turbulent eras of Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages. Roman technological feats in many different areas such as civil engineering, construction materials, transport technology, and some inventions such as the mechanical reaper went unmatched until the 19th century. Romans developed an intensive and sophisticated agriculture, expanded upon existing iron working technology, created laws providing for individual ownership, advanced stonemasonry technology, advanced road-building (exceeded only in the 19th century), military engineering, civil engineering, spinning and weaving and several different machines like the Gallic reaper that helped to increase productivity in many sectors of the Roman economy. They also developed water power through building aqueducts on a grand scale, using water not just for drinking supplies but also for irrigation, powering water mills and in mining. They used drainage wheels extensively in deep underground mines, one device being the reverse overshot water-wheel. They were the first to apply hydraulic mining methods for prospecting for metal ores, and for extracting those ores from the ground when found using a method known as hushing. Roman engineers have built triumphal arches, amphitheatres, aqueducts, public baths, true arch bridges, harbours, dams, vaults and domes on a very large scale across their Empire. Notable Roman inventions include the book (Codex), glass blowing and concrete. Because Rome was located on a volcanic peninsula, with sand which contained suitable crystalline grains, the concrete which the Romans formulated was especially durable. Some of their buildings have lasted 2000 years, to the present day. Roman society had also carried over the design of a door lock with tumblers and springs from Greece. Like many other aspects of innovation and culture that were carried on from Greece to Rome, the lines between where each one originated from have become skewed over time. These mechanisms were highly sophisticated and intricate for the era.Naif A. Haddad, \\"Critical Review, Assessment and Investigation of Ancient Technology Evolution of Door Locking Mechanisms in S.E. Mediterranean,\\" Mediterranean Archaeology & Archaeometry 16, no. 1: 43-74. Roman civilization was highly urbanized by pre- modern standards. Many cities of the Roman Empire had over 100,000 inhabitants with the capital Rome being the largest metropolis of antiquity. Features of Roman urban life included multistory apartment buildings called insulae, street paving, public flush toilets, glass windows and floor and wall heating. The Romans understood hydraulics and constructed fountains and waterworks, particularly aqueducts, which were the hallmark of their civilization. They exploited water power by building water mills, sometimes in series, such as the sequence found at Barbegal in southern France and suspected on the Janiculum in Rome. Some Roman baths have lasted to this day. The Romans developed many technologies which were apparently lost in the Middle Ages, and were only fully reinvented in the 19th and 20th centuries. They also left texts describing their achievements, especially Pliny the Elder, Frontinus and Vitruvius. Other less known Roman innovations include cement, boat mills, arch dams and possibly tide mills. In Roman Egypt, Heron of Alexandria invented the aeolipile, a basic steam-powered device, and demonstrated knowledge of mechanic and pneumatic systems. He was also the first to experiment with a wind-powered mechanical device, a windwheel. He also described a vending machine. However, his inventions were primarily toys, rather than practical machines.

He was Paramount Pictures' supervising art director from 1927 until his retirement in 1950, when he was succeeded by Hal Pereira. Hans Dreier was born in Bremen, Germany in 1885. After studying architecture in Munich, Germany, Dreier worked as imperial supervising architect of the German Cameroon. During World War I, he served in the German Lancers. He began his career in German film in 1919 as an assistant designer at UFA Studios. At the urging of German director Ernst Lubitsch, Dreier relocated to Hollywood in 1923 to work at Paramount Pictures. His first Hollywood film was Forbidden Paradise, directed by Lubitsch and starring Pola Negri. Dreier worked as Paramount's supervising art director from 1927 until his retirement in 1950. He made contributions to nearly 500 films during his lengthy career, including many films directed by Joseph Von Sternberg and Ernst Lubitsch, as well as the film It's a Gift (1934) starring W. C.
